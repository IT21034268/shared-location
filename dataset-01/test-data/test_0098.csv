4,Not Bad,"Like all modern adaptions of H.P. Lovecraft on the big screen, an element of SEX is always inserted. Never mind what the original story was! This is actually a rather chilling tale of a group of tourists who get stuck at the wrong place! Shot in Spain with -- except for Ezra Godden -- a mostly Spanish cast. Hey, it's gotta naked chick (and she is hot) being sacrificed to a Deep One!! Can one ask for more than that? I think not! Something to watch on a rainy day."
1,A truly horrible parody of a Lovecraft novel,"What you see (on the DVD cover, that is) is exactly what you get: a C-rated horror flick ""based"" on H.P. Lovecraft's ""Shadows over Innsmouth."" The fine novel is ruthlessly dissected, basic plot is ripped out of it, the rest thrown away. If you are into rubber tentacles and generously spilled cranberry juice, if Lovecraft stories for you are nothing but a bunch of monsters, then hurry to get this movie. Otherwise, just get comfortable, grab the story and enjoy it in its entirety - dark athmosphere, wonderful language - all that makes Lovecraft's fiction so much appreciated.As for the movie, there is one thought that gives me a warm fuzzy feeling. I know that one day The Great Cthulhu will rise and he will summon those who created this atrocious movie in front of him and they will pay a horrible horrible price for what they have done."
4,Dagon in Galicia,"I saw this movie and I didn't know anything at all about Lovecraft, the short story or Dagon, the god. I just thought it was a wonderfully zany, crazy, quirky horror movie with great creative imagery. But what most impressed me was that it was set in Galicia. What a great choice. Many of you don't know this but even some of the background music and songs are actually authentic gallego folksongs.I realize this may not be of vital importance to most of you. But it is a fact that might add to your enjoyment."
2,NEED MORE SAVING OPPORTUNITIES!,"Although the age category begins at 6 for this game, my 7 year old (and I must confess, I too) find this game montonous and frustrating. The reason is the inability to quick save during the game...You can only save a game after you successfully complete each level.If you are in the middle or even near the end of a level, and you run the misfortune of using up your last life, you are brought back to the beginning of that level...TOO MUCH JUMPING OVER WATER!!! My son loved the movie, but has given up on this game...Disney needs to go back to the drawing board on this one..."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"Ah, I can just imagine the project manager at Disney Interactive: ""Hey, here's an idea: let's create a game that appeals to small children, but let's make sure that they have to use a computer keyboard to move the characters around, so the kid can't actually play it. The kid will have to watch while a parent plays. Oh yeah, and let's make the game really, really boring as well. And be sure to use second-generation graphics while you're at it.""If you MUST buy something from Disney, stick to the movies or dolls. Trust me. Whatever you do, stay away from this turkey."
3,works good just not 3rd Gen compatible,"Bought this used works great. Did some scouting prior to buying and thought this was supposed to charge the ipod aswell, well it does just not the Gen3 which happens to be what I have. No Alpine ipod cord will charge the 3rd gen ipod."
2,Is it real?,"It seemed to me that this wasn't a genuine alpine cable. It didn't look right, and I really had to jam the AI-Net plug into the HU's connector to make it fit. And I'm a pretty big guy.Once I got it all the way in the connector (finally), it sounds great, and the deck preforms as expected. Frankly, a cable is a cable, especially dealing with digital. But it'd sure be nice if the proprietary connectors fit."
1,total waste of time,"Seeing the relatively high rating, I thought of giving it a try. To say I was disappointed would be an understatement. There isn't really much development of any character or relationships. They are stuck right from the beginning with little explanation for viewers to go on. May be there is some at the end but I wouldn't know since I finally ran out of patience after almost an hour and stopped it."
1,Don't bother,Worthless movie. Even watching for it for free wasn't worth it. The relationship was so unappealing that I kept waiting for her to go ballistic and beat the crap out of him for him stalking her. That would have been more interesting.
2,boring,"To me this movie was boring-sure not worth buying-which I did before previewing it, lesson learned, I will in the future preview first,,,sally"
1,don't bother,this movie is a waste of time I have nothing complimentary to say about this movie not the least entertaining
4,Broken people can fit together like jigsaw puzzle pieces,"Just likeNights and WeekendsorTrippers, the movie explores how a dysfunctional couple can complement each other in a very functional way. The rhythm may be slow for some, but audiences interested in a more intimate look at a pair of very peculiar characters will definitely endure and enjoy the movie. It also has quite a few quirky and funny moments that make the protagonists and their circumstances all the more endearing. It's not only about the ups and downs of love, but the story deals with self-discovery and self-improvement because of another person and what they inspire. All in all, I recommend this movie to anyone with an affinity for romance even in the weirdest and most awkward of situations."
5,What a beautiful ring !,I have just received my ring. I love it! It's absolutely gorgeous. The stones are bright and tiny but very delicate. If you like big stones this ring it's not for you. But if you are looking for a special one this is for you. I recommend it.
4,MALATHION FOR FLEAS,"PRODUCT DID NOT SAY IT WOULD KILLS A FLEA INFESTATION, BUT I GAVE IT A TRY AND AFTER APPLYING AT 9 TBS/DAY/GAL IT FINALLY WORKED ON THE 5TH DAY. NO MORE FLEAS. HOPE THIS HELPS."
2,This one did not age well,"The contrast between ""Foundation"" (1951) and ""The Stars, Like Dust"" (1951) illustrates that Asimov's ideas are much stronger than his characters. Story elements like romance, which depend upon interesting characters acting in a believable manner, are his Achilles heel.TSLD is an adventure story without Asimov's ""big ideas"", so the reader is left to dwell upon its small cast of shallow, juvenile, and howlingly anachronistic characters.It is easily his worst work, and can be safely skipped even by ardent SF fans."
1,Not Worth It....,"This potty is no good. It is smaller then you think, and the music playing does not last. My son doesn't like it at all and i had to buy a whole new potty for him. This potty is more of a toy then an actually teaching potty. I don't reccommend it."
2,Dirty Royal Potty,"Great potty, arrived on time and non-damaged. However, it had been previously removed from its original packaging which was obvious due to the large dirt footprint on the lid. There was also dirt and grass inside the potty. It doesnt appear to have been used as a potty but someone definitely did do something with it. Since it was not damaged I didnt want the hassle of returning it but I am very disappointed in the seller and will not buy from them again."
5,Illustrates revolutionary tactics at subverting a democracy,"This political tract book outlines Marxist revolutionary tactics at subverting a democratic parliamentary government. Thus, making a 'legal' change to a social democracy which then erodes into a socialist totalitarian dictatorship. This book illustrates the 'legal' transitional communist takeover of Czechoslavakia without a shot fired. This is strikingly similar to the Hitler-led NSDAP takeover of Germany in the 1930's.This book should serve as a cautionary warning of how democracy can be subverting and how the constitutional checks and balances of the American Republic serve as a protection against this subversion (assuming that there preserved and not subverted.) Although, it is a little expensive for a book under a 100 pages, it is nonetheless informative."
2,Children of the River,"This book started out great. As I read further I started to become bored. On the other hand it is a good a story line. It is about a girl, Sandara, that likes this boy named Jonothon. To find out what happens read the book Children of the river."
2,Not Worth It,"I understood from another source that this was a book of poems about the Holy Grail edited by Waite. In fact it is all by Waite, and the Grail in it is entirely symbolic. You will find no Perceval or Galahad here. The book is published by a Masonic publishing company. The technical skill of the poetry is minimal, and the sense often vague."
4,bringing back the funk,"From what I've read about David Eggers, the wordsmith's philosophy falls along the lines of, ""Hey, wouldn't it be neat to actually have fun, writing?"" No surprise, then, that this compilation by McSweeney's, in which Eggers is a player, frolicks in working with literary superstars. Judge this book by its cover, but be forewarned. These authors are just having a good time. You won't find a copy of The Stand hidden between pages 40 and 65. Amy Bender might have written more than Michael Crichton, and Rick Moody isn't locked into his usual breed of psychological realism. If you are looking for an explanation of the soul, rife with semantic theory and cryptic allusions to history, go pick up the latest by Umberto Eco. Thrilling Tales is a singular because of its failures, amateurism, successes, twists and unexpected styles. Approach it with an open mind. After all, wouldn't it be neat to actually have fun, reading?"
1,Less than thrilling ...,"A massive disappointment. Based on the book's packaging and some misguided reviews, I was expecting, well, thrilling tales. Action and adventure and intrigue, not unlike the chapters in Chabon's Kavlier and Clay where he introduces the Escapist and Luna Moth.Well, I sure didn't find much of that. The only stories that really caught my attention were the Glen David Gold, the Elmore Leonard, and Chabon's own contribution. Neil Gaiman's story was particularly disappointing. It looked like something he tossed together in an afternoon. The mainstream writers should stick to mainstream stuff. That's mostly what they were doing in this anthology, anyway.So, if you want to read good, honest to God genre stuff, take a look at the Year's Best SF and Year's Best Fantasy series edited by David G. Hartwell."
2,Disappointment,"I picked up this book mainly because of Michael Chabon and I wanted to read some short stories for a while. I read maybe 5 of the stories before I put it down. I was quite disappointed with the ones I read, and didn't want to waste time by reading further. Squonk was the best of the ones I read, but the others didn't hold my interest very long. I'd suggest choosing another short story collection. Or pick up Chabon's 'Adventures of Cavalier and Clay.' A much better read."
5,The Greatest Western Ever,"This was the book that got me hooked on reading. I am sad to say I didn't start reading books until I was 20 when I joined the Air Force. I bought this book at the PX and wondered why this book won the Pulitzer. Anyway, I was not intimidated by the number of pages. The first one hundred pages were a struggle, but the way it was written made it tolerable. It wasn't until I reached Part II of the book that the story REALLY, REALLY got good and stayed the course the rest of the book. This was the first book I've read more than once--all 993 pages."
2,Decided it wasn't worth it,"This novel is like the Rio Grande river, where the story begins: Long, wide, but only a few feet deep.I read almost 400 pages, waiting to be gripped, but then I gave up and rented the miniseries on DVD instead. It's terrific -- four stars!The next time I want to read a Western, I'll get a Louis L'Amour. Fun, well-written, packs a punch, and done in two days."
5,Loved It!,"What a summer ride I've been on reading Lonesome Dove. I don't know where I've been the last 15 years to only now discover this absolutely amazing story. I smiled, laughed, and cried my way through it. I will surely miss the Hat Creek Cattle boys keeping me up at night. What an adventure!"
3,LD,"Lonesome Dove seemed like a good book. It shows the way the western frontier, was back then. I would have liked it better if I had read more."
5,this novel is an epic because of its two legendary heroes.,"lonesome dove is about the American West and those who peopled it. It is a prose ""love poem"" to the West.I have taught this novel and my students loved it."
3,"Such a good book, too bad the ending was awful","I really loved this book, well most of it. I stayed up until midnight to finish it and was so disappointed in the last 4 chapters. It's as if the author couldn't figure out what to do with the ending. It just ENDS. There are lots of loose ends & lots of questions (at least from me) concerning the characters. Hopefully, I'll get some answers in the sequel.I really loved the main characters of Gus & Call, and the author did a great job with finishing up their storylines. It's the rest of characters that are left hanging. Oh well, onto ""Streets of Laredo"""
5,This book has it all,"I have never read a Western before, and probably don't want to ever again because there is not much chance that it could live up to this story.This story has it all, action, adventure, comedy, romance, sex and violence. The characters are all very well done. The contrast between Gus and Call is fascinating. I couldn't put this book down. Great book!"
3,"Okay knife, faulty spring assist","I recently bought this knife expecting it to work, bad move on my part. The knife itself is great, very sharp, holds an edge, looks and feels great. But the spring will only open the blade about 75%, rendering the spring it self useless because I still have to push the blade into the locked open position. Did this happen to anybody else? Is there something I can do to fix it? I've already tried a few drops of 3 in 1 oil to no avail."
5,dvd review,"Morgan Freeman, Dan Akroyd, and Jessica Tandy are absolutely wonderful in this movie that details an unspoken friendship between a fussy woman and her driver. From a historical view, there is an actual building/factory in Nashville, Tennessee named Werthan."
4,Touching Story Teaches Valuable Lesson,"This unforgettable film is timeless and can be enjoyed by the entire family. Its lessons are invaluable.Tracing the autumn and winter years of Daisy Werthen through her relationship with her chauffeur, we learn how a woman of strong opinions can change her view of the world through the help of an uneducated yet wise man.Morgan Freeman plays the part of the chauffeur, known as ""Hoke,"" and Jessica Tandy is featured as the strong-willed curmudgeon, Miss Daisy. Over the years, Hoke becomes indispensable to Miss Daisy, despite her initial dismissive attitude toward the man. Through his kind nature and overall good character, he becomes her closest friend and she his staunchess ally.This film will touch your heart at its very core and leave an indelible mark with a positive message to be learned by all."
5,GREAT MOVIE,"WHY I LIKED THE MOVIE ""DRIVING MISS DAISY""GOOD MOVIE, THE WAY ALL MOVIES SHOULD BE!! CLEAN AND FAMILY FRIENDLY!! I HAD THE MOVIE IN VHS AND LET A FRIEND BORROW IT AND SHE DAMAGED THE TAPE AND NEVER REPLACED, HENCE I DON'T LEND OUT MOVIES ANYMORE!! I WATCH THE SAME MOVIE OVER AND OVER AGAIN. I DON'T GET TIRED OF SEEING THE MOVIES I PICK OUT!!"
3,Why no Widescreen,I would just like to know why this DVD is not produced in its original aspect ratio? No widescreen stinks. This and Chariots of Fire are the only DVDs that have won the Best Picture Oscar that I want for my collection that aren't letterboxed. Why? Why? Why?
2,What a crime,"It was criminal that this movie won best film. Films like ""Glory,"" which was snubbed by the academy, and ""Born on the Forth of July"" were more deserving. ""Do the Right Thing,"" which came out that year, was a far superior film on racism than this trite film about a guy driving an old lady around. ""Driving Miss Daisy"" is fraught with cliches and vapid sentimentality. Even comedians made fun of it, ""I'm going to drive you to the WALL"" (in reverse, high speed). The ponderous dialogue between ole Daisy and Hoke in a moving vehicle didn't measure about to the vastly superior dialogue in a static restaurant in ""My Dinner with Andre."" I sense ""Miss Daisy"" got the warm fuzzy award; it was a roundabout way to give an aged actresses, Jessica Tandy, a life achivement award."
5,We Need More Like This...,"Were I a schoolteacher, this film would be required watching by every student of mine. It's a story of love and friendship that transcends any and all boundaries of age, race, or religion. Anyone who isn't reaching for the tissues at the end of this one has no heart."
5,I love this movie,I am so glad I purchased this movie! It is one of my all time favorite movies and I have watched it several times since receiving it from Amazon.The acting and writing is supurb!!
3,Not much to the story,"Compared with part one this episode felt a bit light on. Although there is a couple of dramatic incidents, nothing really changes from the first one. I will read the third, but suspect this is a case of the author dragging a story out too long, which is a shame as the concept is good."
2,A squandered opportunity,"With all of the name recognition that Rolling Stone has, it's too bad (although not unexpected) that they didn't do a better job with this compilation. I'm rather sure that for a sizeable number of Rolling Stone readers this will be their introduction to blues, so why give them ""Bad to the Bone"" - a staple of rock radio across the nation? Would it have been so awful to leave off Clapton, Raitt and Kenny Wayne - who already have plenty o' fame? This compilation doesn't even really have any kind of cohesive quality that I can see, as it isn't a history of blues, it isn't showcasing new artists or even essential recordings, unless one calls it 'mainly blues-based rock'.It's good that Albert King and John Lee Hooker show up here; one can only hope that those that do plunk down their cash for this will be prompted dig deeper into actual blues."
1,BS,"Item says in stock and will ship in two days! Then after two days you get an email that says ""Sorry for the inconveinence but your item is out of stock and will be 10 days later"" (or MORE!) I wish AMAZON would just go back to doing it themselves instead of letting any dork with a website sell stuff. This is BS! This is probably the last time I will do business with AMAZON or ANY of it's so called merchants."
4,Great Product for Busy Mom's,"Great for when you are in too much of a hurry to cook breakfast or make a lunch. The flavor is rich and chocolatey, add a bannana, a cup of 2% milk, blend it up and you are good to go."
5,Rare Find,"I had never heard of James Danaher prior to reading this book. I ordered the book because I was intrigued by the title. Danaher has the rare ability to write about complex issues in a clear,direct, and concise manner. He says no more than he has to, but he says all that needs to be said. Danaher blends philosophy, theology, biblical exegesis, and traditional Christian spirituality with uncommon ease. Many of my PoMo colleagues have little use for Christianity. Many of my Christian friends see postmodernism as code for all that is unholy. I think both groups would enjoy and benefit from reading Dr Danaher's work."
4,fuf,"Happy with the product, although it took us some time to shape it out of the box shape it was delivered in,"
3,Fuf chair,Pretty cool how it comes all compressed. But i have to say it's not as big as you're lead to believe. It's big - don't get me wrong. But it's not mammoth. And the person in the picture must be really small for the chair to look so big. It's cool and a conversation piece. But it's heavy if you want to move it. Was it worth what I paid? Probably not. Is it cool? Yeah.
3,It works,This light was fairly easy to install and works as advertised. The only problem with it is that the metal housings for the lamps do not lock into the base securely.
1,I can't hear any difference,"After all the hype about the Polk XRt12 I was expecting the sound quality from this unit to be nothing short of astonishing. I'm sorry to say that I'm disappointed. While it was a breeze to hook up via optical cable to my Harman/Kardon AVR110 and it was simple to aim the antenna (according to the ""antenna aiming signal strength indicator"" I had a perfect signal) it has the same quality as my Delphi SkyFi unit that it replaces. I can't hear any difference between the two. Even with side by side comparison (Polk XRt12 vs. Delphi Skyfi) they sound the same. I wouldn't recommend buying this to replace any exisiting home unit. If you already have XM at home, the signal sounds just as good with what you already have. With all the compression involved in beaming the XM signals to earth, there's only so much any device can extract. You simply can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear."
3,A Youth at War,"As a fan of Confederate General Daniel Harvey Hill I was very happy to discover this slim little volume by his aide, Major James Ratchford. In addition to staff duty with D.H.Hill, Ratchford served as adjutant to John Bell Hood and Stephen Lee and witnessed over thirty engagements from Bethel to Bentonville including the disastrous Franklin-Nashville battles. This little book lets the reader see the war (and a number of its senior participants) through the eyes of a young man who may have preferred cordial young ladies and fine fishing to the battlefield. See also Hal Bridges' bio of D.H.Hill - LEE'S MAVERICK GENERAL."
1,Oops,"I bought chocolate through the mail in August in New Mexico. I didn't even think about the fact that it would need to be insulated/refrigerated. When it arrived, it was melted. I do however remember the chocolate bar being delicious the last time I had it...alas....not this time."
4,as described,"The item was as described and it arrived quickly, was packaged well. I have no complaints. I have nothing else to write."
5,Necessary for CamCorders,"This product is necessary when using the Dazzle component to upload videos to any video web streaming. Attach the Red/White leads coming from your CamCorder to this adapter into the ""Mic"" input normally ""blue"" on your computer. Leave the ""yellow"" as the video feed from the ""Dazzle"" component & away you go. I use Pinnacle software for testing before uploading to make sure all feeds are working properly (Audio/Video). Must have adapter for anyone with a CamCorder."
2,Item was a second shipment,"For the $0.75 cents we should have just kept it for a backup. However, when (mother) heard it was the second one and that it had to be returned, she wrote return to sender and mailed it. We have yet to receive merchandise reimbursement to my credit card..............................I am waiting."
5,Perfect and Works!!!,The sound quality is great and it just snaps in place fine. Perfect for anyone looking for this type of adapter.
3,No Need,"This will come in handy for those use, but I really did not need it so remember make sure its whats needed first before buying."
1,Useless,"I purchased this item to connect a turntable to my PC soundcard. The adapter produced a loud hum. I tried two seperate turntables and the result was the same. As a backup, I had also purchased a 3.5mm 1/8"" Mini Plug to 2 RCA Jacks Y Adapter 6 inch which was considerably cheaper. This Y adapter worked well at about a quarter of the cost. It does not seem cost effective to return the Cables To Go product so it will just get trashed."
5,it worked,this thing worked really well would recommend to anybody who's trying to buy an RCA cable i had no problems with it
4,I love the Clydesdale!,The horse is sooo cute! I think my horse-riding niece will love it. I got the purple funky flower carrier to go with it; they look great together. They make me excited for Christmas! It's too far away!
5,The Roar of '74,"Three tunes on this ablum, make it worth its weight in classic Rich gold.Don Menza's ""Time Check"". One of the many classic and oft-performed charts by college and high school bands in the 70's, expertly written by Menza. Pat LaBarbera's cutting-edge solo and the usual masterful sax soli written by Menza.Greg Hopkins latin-tinged ""Nutville"", with exciting solo work by Hopkins and LaBarbera. Fast-paced and foot-tapping.And ""Waltz of the Mushroom Hunters"" (also a Hopkins treatment) with clean, easy-going solos by Buddy Budson on keyboards and LaBarbera on soprano sax.These three alone are worth buying and listening to the entire album, over and over again."
3,Good Software but not quit Microsoft Office for Windows,"This is a good software, however it can be ""slow as molasses"" at times. Keep in mind it will allow you to work with Win Office files easier than NeoOffice and Open Office. Im comparing this version to Microsoft Office 2003 (Excel, Word and Outlook - I dont use PowerPoint that much). Also, it is much better than Mac Office 2008 or any version of Windows Office after 2003. Both these older version are tried and tested and in my opinion are easier to use and more reliable than their successors.One final item of note, the software I purchased from Galatic Software came with THREE LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED LICENSE KEYS. The description says the software comes with only 2 user licenses."
2,misleding label,"I bought this version of Micrdosoft Word because I thought the label, Teaachers and Students, meant it included the education discount to which I am entitled. I can see why it might be useful to a student, but I hate it. It takes extra steps to do what I want and I cannot get the things I want. As soon as I can afford te replace it, I will."
2,"not so good, for my mac & me","Unfortunately I am not too pleased with this product because it seems to have adversely affected my mac. I have been unable to get msn messenger and my online access has slowed down & my primary email has taken on all sorts of weird quirks.Perhaps it's just too much product for me. I am a luddite in these matters so I'm not the best person to ask.I can, however access more attachments, files etc so I'll reserve final judgement"
3,Necessary evil at an affordable price,"You buy MS Office because you have to exchange Word docs, Excel spreadsheets and PowerPoint presentations with other people (mostly Windows users). This $150 USD package allows you to do that.Bottom line.Buy it if you prefer to use Word, etc. for your work.Buy it if you must for file exchange."
4,Great Product,"I love office, but all my experience with it has been on a PC so it has been hard to switch to the mac version. Everything is laid out differently but it is at least a universal document format so I can work on it wherever I am."
3,My Mac didn't use to crash,"I moved to Mac after more than a decade of PC use because I was sick of getting ""application not responding"" messages. In 9 months of owning my iBook, I think I had one message of this sort, that is until I installed Office for Mac. Welcome back to Microsoft!Don't get me wrong, the applications are well designed and presently there is no other office suite that can compete. They look great and aside from a few weird functionality issues I have been happy with Office. But just like Windows, these programs crash all the time. At least once a week Word or Entourage will simply freeze. At lot of times this happens when I am cutting and pasting between the two.Anyway, be forewarned, if you are a Mac zealot, you might enjoy Office but be prepared to be even madder at Microsoft."
5,Can't live without this!,"After getting my new MAC laptop for student and Mac computer for office, found that I could not communicate with business world with attachments for e-mails as well as the fact that the Professors would only accept homework in a word format. So I went to PC magazine did investigations there for the Microsoft Office 2008 and found many big problems MAC users were having with 2008 version. Went to the great Apple Support Chats with users and found huge amount said they wish they would have stayed with their 2004 version because the computer with 2008 was constantly crashing and slowing down and nothing but problems. So I can say fabulous 2004 version, no problems, hasn't slowed down computer. And attachments with my e-mails are so easy. This product you can't live without if you are a student or business person."
3,S-L-O-W,"Let me start off by saying I love my MacBook; it's the greatest computer. I have had several PC's (a couple of Dells and a couple of HP's - including notebooks and towers), and they don't ""hold a candle"" to any Mac.I had to purchase Microsoft Office in order to submit schoolwork online. I don't have a beef with MS Office in general, but it does slow my MacBook down significantly. If I'm not working in any MS application, it's business as usual on my Mac - quick Safari (so much faster than Explorer - even pages with lots of graphics load up in seconds), quick mail, etc. But if I am working in MS, then everything operates like a turtle, like a PC. Quite annoying. Hence, the 3 stars."
5,What can I say? I'm a Mac girl,"Ok so maybe I am a Mac fanatic, but this is well worth the investment. I use these programs everyday, and I even think they are better than their PC counterparts. If you have a Mac, you should have this product. I only wish I could give it more stars."
5,completely satisfied,I received the 2004 Mac edition of Microsoft Word in only a few days. It was still wrapped in original packaged as stated. Completely Satisfied with this purchase and would definitely buy again from this sender
4,"W,X,P fine; E is needy on my Mac","Having been a Word user since version 1, I still like it although the fonts do not show up regular size as in previous versions. I do not regularly use Excel or Powerpoint, but they look as though they should perform admirably.My chief gripe is with Entourage. The mail gives me duplicates of everything. The junk mail corner is great...catches most of it. Those things are OK, my problem is that I cannot send mail from this program. The server will not accept it, so I have to go to ""Mail"" application on my Mac to send mail to someone. It is a bit incommodious to read mail on one application and reply on another. I am running Tiger X (OS 10.4.6) and any help you have will be greatly appreciated.The software arrived in a short time, installed easily. I do like ordering from Amazon because I have yet to have an error in my order, and the material is always of top quality.Thank you."
3,"Nice, but no Entourage","I was very sorry and frustrated to learn that the software won't connect to the Exchange server with Office's Entourage. It's not included with the program. That's why I bought it, should have paid more attention at the time."
5,great book,chose this product because of the rating which did not mislead us thanks for the great service and great book
2,Not New,"Product was advertised as ""new"" and packaged as such. When, opened and inspected, the disc was dirty and scratched and clearly had been used before."
4,"Honestly, the main reason to watch this is how hot Elvira is","Yes, the main reason anyone watches this for the first time at least is because Elvira is in the top 3 sexiest women in history. Some people only come back for that reason. Some people don't think that's a good enough reason to come back. But in my humble opinion, it really is an alright movie. In a way, even though its just a corny comedy, if you really think about it, Elvira is just like Tyler Durden from Fight Club. His main objective in life was to free people from the 9 o 5 lives they hated but supposedly ""had to"" live out. Elvira doesn't come to this hokey religious town to free them, but she ends up doing it. Also she battles evil. And in the end she lives out what her main objective IS: to perform in Vegas. Sexy Sexy. Well, i've probably bored you enough, and you don't wanna read, you wanna stare at Elvira's chest. So stop reading and get this movie!"
4,HAS BEEN A FAVORITE OF MINE FOR A LONG TIME,I GET A BIG KICK OUT ELVIRA'S CAMPY HUMOR. THIS MOVIE IS WELL WORTH WATCHING. I ORDERED A COPY FOR MY MOTHER AS WELL.
4,Guilty Pleasure,"Call it a guilty pleasure, this movie is alot of fun. It's gags are sharp and clever and delivered with gusto by the sexy and very funny Elvira. The story revolves around Elvira's inheritance and the crazy and creepy things that happen as a result of it. Sure it's a silly concoction but it's high camp and funny low brow humor make the whole film extremely entertaining. I have had many repated viewings of it over the years. You'll get a kick out of the really great one liners. A cult classic in the making!"
2,I wished I had shopped around,Very cheaply made and should have been included with the co-sleeper. The sleeper wobbles with these attached and they are just molded light plastic. I hope it lasts as long as I need it.
5,Gets the job done,"Our bed + mattress is pretty high and I needed the extensions to raise the cosleeper to my level. I tried the cosleeper without it for a week and it was breaking my back to dip down to pick up the baby to breastfeed at night.Giving birth naturally injured my back/hip. It took me 2 months to fully recover. So having the cosleeper at my level really helped me. Plus having the baby within my arm's reach to soothe also added more hours to my sleep, which I desperately needed since I was the only one at home to take care of the baby (hubby had to go back to work after the first week).Adding the extensions does make the bed more shaky, but it's not going to collapse or tip over, especially when the cosleeper is right next to the adult bed."
1,Worthless for older co-sleepers,"We also have an older version of the co-sleeper, and these don't fit. There is nothing on the package or in the description that says they won't fit older models -- they're supposed to fit the mini, original, and universal.Also, as someone else pointed out, they warn you on the front of the package not to use in ""bassinet mode"". Why else would I need them? I certainly don't need to boost the height when it's in pack & play mode! Definitely a rip-off."
2,Pretentious. Self-indulgent. Don't bother.,"This book has to be one of the most pretentious and self-indulgent books I have ever read. The author seems to care very little for her reader and just tries to show off her supposed skill with language. In the hands of Nabokov or Rushdie such experimentalism is genius and beautiful. In the hands of Ali Smith it is clumsy and self-indulgent. In fact, this book made me angry. Whatever happened to telling a good story or developing characters? It is as though Ms Smith just spewed up whatever was in her head on to the page with very little thought into how to make her characters complex, give the themes any depth or subtlety, or advance the narrative. And to think she received critical acclaim for this book. Ugh. Bring back Nabokov! I weep at the thought that this is the future of ""good"" literature."
2,I Couldn't Finish This....,"and as an avid reader and slightly type-A person I allow myself to quit very few books. The hype around this book made me put it on my wish list right from the beginning. I chose to start this book over 3 others I ordered at the same time. Disjointed, completely out of touch with any reality I know, sublte to the point I think the author actually doesn't know what she is writing about. Lots of gratutitous sex. Not shocking just ENOUGH already. I have three teenagers, I am a woman in her early 40's and I have often wanted to escape. Just not with this book."
2,An Accident,I relied on the reviews and bought this book. A new word that means pretentious to the 5th power would have to be invented to accurately discribe it. The author knows words and how to use them but in the end nothing is produced. There is talent here and intrigue to be sure but it is a self-indulgent effort.
5,Playing with Imagination,"Some stories have a power to uplift, to heal, to stimulate, surprise, and bring fresh experience. Ali Smith has set her heart to deliberately conspire to compose such a story!Neel Mukherjee, of The Times fame, expresses the spirit of the story much better than I ever could:""As with her astonishing first novel, Like, Smith leaves out more than she puts in. It is left to the reader to make the connections, draw the threads together, and fill in the gaps. (...)Smith plays dizzying games with her story and language; she bends and buckles her prose, breathes fire into it, lets it cool, swirls it up in unimaginable shapes. This is writing as rapture, as giddy delight."""
3,Family summer rental,I think Ms Smith employs language well but did not care for or identify with any of the characters. Will not try her again for a while.
5,These Books are Hard to Find,"I love all her books. Very content rich, but they are becoming harder and harder to find. I has to go to mabelwhite dot com to get her books that are sold out here. Her videos are the best investment I have made."
2,Rev. Mellencamp's Sermon of the Week,"John Mellencamp has always had messages in his work, but this time, the Reverend Mellencamp sacrifices music on his PC altar. The message is fine (mostly of the can't-we-all-get-along sort), but the writing is about as subtle as a rubber mallet and the music, for the most part, seems like rejected Jimmy Buffett tunes, complete with the faux-soul female backup singers. After listening to the first two songs, the title cut and the first single 'Peaceful World', you almost expect the next two songs to be 'Please Don't Litter' and 'No Drinking and Driving'. Mercifully, Mellencamp diverts his attention to women, love, and sex in the middle of the CD... saving the album at least a little. Mellencamp needs to leave the messages to Bono and Stipe and pay more attention to his songwriting. A big disappointment from a usually solid artist."
2,Out of Chords,"I am a big fan,and rushed to the store to get ""Cuttin' Heads"" the day it came out. A lot of John's music gets better with repeated listenings, but this is not one of them. I come from the point of view that the melody carries the lyrics, so lyrics aside, this album stinks compared to the best of his previous work. Poor John is just flat out of chords. Almost every song is propelled by the same monotonous melody.I,ve listened to it at least five times, and it gets worse every time I hear it. It pains me to write this, but I'm pleading with you John to spend some serious time on your next effort coming up with the melodies that made me a fan in the first place."
5,Timeless info,"This was the first book I read on my iPad, and I really enjoyed it. The information is timeless and old enough for us all to have witnessed these same lessons play out in our lifetime. It reminds me of an elder explaining core success traits, but applicable in their time. I would recommend this book is read by young adults as early as possible."
2,"Too old, not so valuabe","Well, it's a really short book, but the ideas on it are old and too general, too broad. I wouldn't recommend you spending your time on it."
4,Time,I wasn't happy witht the amount of time it took to ship this product. But I was happy with what I ordered.
5,She is the best at what she does!!!,"This CD is everything you could ask for and then some. I can idetify with all on the CD and have fond memories of different occasions for each duet. Love the Barry Gibb, Neil Diamond, and Don Johnson duets. Each of those evoke very special memories for me!! After you listen to this CD you really wonder why some of the younger singers today still make money------they are all so very far beneath Streisand when it comes to talent and a great voice."
3,Not a must have...,"I could not wait to buy this album. Particularly for the Josh Groban and Babs duet... however, while many classics are here, there is not enough new to warrant the purchase. I am a huge Barbra fan and I have most of her work in my collection already. Hence, the majority of these songs can be found on earlier albums. The new ones for me included one with Barry Manilow which I did not care for and one with Josh Groban that I really hoped to like. I was not thrown with that one either. Neither song has a catchy tune and the vocal highlights are not as impressive as I'd hoped. I would recommend this to people who don't already have a lot of Barbra in their music collection. Else... I would skip it."
2,How many MORE Compilations Babs????,We love you Babs...but come on..HOW many MORE Compilations with One or two NEW songs....Let's make this the last..OK??
2,Enough already!,"If ever an example of the pointlessness of celebrity duets was needed, then this is it. Barbra and her friends try and out sing each other in a dreary collection of very poor songs. The only exceptions being the duets with Barry Gibb, Neil Diamond and Johnny Mathis. The rest just scream of the record company trying anything to get a hit. As album tracks they may be ok, but all grouped together it is just way,way too much."
5,Excellent,This was another tape that I had missed when it first came out...but glad I received it now. Some great duets
3,Poor remastering,3 stars only for content and Streisand. Don't waste your money even though the CD is cheap. Poor remastering and sound quality.
2,"Well, the pictures are certainly nice!","This book would have benefitted hugely from a bit of competent editing by someone possessed of a nodding familiarity with English grammar and usage, and perhaps an eye for layout; the text meant to accompany the photographs may be related to them only with difficulty. Overall, the Collector's Digest to Beer Cans exudes the cobbled-together aura of earnest, well-meaning, but ultimately amateurish production. The photographs themselves are nicely executed, though perhaps smaller than utility would dictate. The array of cans represented pictorally and, in a later section, textually, is fairly extensive, though not comprehensive by any means. Certainly, this is a very useful book for the price; one finds, though, that it merely whets the appetite for more thoroughgoing references."
5,sydwalk,"My son got this for Christmas from Santa, it is a great gift- Lots of fun!! The adults tried it and had just as much fun as the my 6 year old."
5,"Fun, fun, fun","Kids absolutely love it! It says couple of phrases, changes voice- just as described and it is durable. I definately recommend this toy!"
4,The kids love it!,What a great toy! My 2 1/2 year old LOVES it. After about 30 minutes i want to turn on the mute button because he walks around breathing heavily into like Darth Vader. LoL! It's definately worth buying.
4,Transformer helmet,this product was very good and was useful for its purpose. Our dogs were afraid of it! The kids had a great time playing with it!
3,"Fun, but too pricey","I purchased this toy for a birthday gift for my son who wanted it badly. I shopped around to get the best bargain and it was here at Amazon. It arrived very quickly in perfect condition. My son was extremely happy to receive the helmet, but after a week he lost interest. I'm glad I shopped around for the lowest price, because if I had paid what other merchants were charging, I would have felt very badly. In my opinion, there are other toys available which would give a higher return in fun and creativity for the cost."
5,Great Fun toy!!,"My son who is only 3 got this for Xmas. He is thrilled with it. He thinks he is a power ranger. The echoing strange robotic voice that comes out when he talks is GREAT!!My only complaints are that the back top piece..that is suppose to snap off for head adjustment keeps falling off, due to my sons throwing the helmet off at times. I think with an older child this may not happen. It doesn't really affect the toy even with it off.Also the microphone is sensitive! It sometimes picks up my voice when I am next to him....maybe this means I am too loud.Overall a GREAT toy. Highly recommended! LOVE IT!!"
5,Optimus Prime Voice Changer Helmet is AWESOME!,"My 4-year-old son loves Transformers, so when I saw this item I bought it right away. It did not disappoint! He's had it for over a month and he still wears it every day. I would highly recommend this to anyone that loves Transformers."
1,Over priced!,"Has gone up over $30 in price. Don't buy from these bloodsuckers. Fred Meyer has it for $34 and I'm sure any other toy store has it as well. Hell, check Wal Mart or Target."
4,Fun,"I got this for my son who is 4. He loved it! So did everyone else at the party, including the adults. My only problem with it is that the top part that covers the batteries tends to come off often. Other than that, this toy is so much fun!"
4,Works. Has all the bells & whistles. Cheap too!,"So far this product has been working well.It does require some space for the heat to blow out, and the fan seem to constantly run.But, the 12-volt pass through works even if the inverter is off, which is great."
3,How many books will it take for tax payers to take their responsibility and call it off?,This is another account of the crime against a population that is happening every day at tax payers expenses. How many books will it take on the subject matter to have the public at wide take the matter up and put it on the G20 agenda where it rightly belongs. The reading of this sorry account enraged me. Please read this book and others such as 'U.N. a Cosa Nostra' or ' The road to hell:...'U.N. a Cosa Nostra: The workings of an organization 'helping' the poorest of the world (Volume 1)The Road to Hell: The Ravaging Effects of Foreign Aid and International Charity
2,Shoddy workmanship and poor design,"I purchased two different pairs of these: 1 pair of 10lb wrist weights, 1 pair of 20 lb ankle weights. Both pairs are leaking the steel shot that makes them heavy. Both pairs leave black dust on the floor. I am concerned about lifting these over my eyes and face due to these leaks. I must sweep the floor after each use to clean up the shot and black dust that they produce.I can not tighten either pair to the point necessary to keep them from sliding and twisting without putting extra layers of fabric (socks, etc) underneath.I have only owned these for 2 months or so and I'm already shopping for replacements. I would NOT recommend these."
5,An excellent album to sit and listen to,"When you think of Mannheim Steamroller, you think excellent Christmas music. Well, in fact, those albums are just part of the large Mannheim Steamroller discography. This album is part of the Day Parts series - each album designed to capture the mood of a different part of the week. Drawing on coffee as a theme, the tracks are all relaxing and reflective. Some are quite old, and some are new, with the final track (composed and performed by Chip Davis) is pure Mannheim Steamroller.I found this to be a very nice album - like I said, relaxing and reflective. It's an excellent album to sit and listen to, and just enjoy!"
5,This book has stayed with me for years,"In place of the word ""unsentimental"" often used to describe this book I'd use ""Lynchian"", as in David. Blindness is just the starting-off point: The book is really a luxuriant journey into the *other* four senses and the heightened reality one begins to feel -- for instance how the white noise of a sudden rain can throw your outdoor echolocation into turmoil and immobilize you at some random place. With all respect to anyone looking for a good book on the disability, this one is for the artists."
2,The review and rating is for the UBISOFT edition I ordered from Amazon,"I do enjoy this game, but...I bought this copy in August of 2009. I first installed it on my old Windows 98SE machine. It worked fine until I finished level 5 (Palace 2). It would show the loading bar progress, reach the end, then... nothing. It would just stay at that screen. I tried installing it on a couple other computers and I got the same thing. I was able to exchange the game. I installed it, played it... Got to the same problem at the end of level 5! Has anybody else had the same issue with the UBISOFT edition of this game? And if so, were you able to fix the problem and how?I found the Red Orb version on EBAY. It works well, I was able to finish the entire game. The Prince moves much faster in the UBISOFT version but I would rather play a whole game with a slow moving character than part of a game with a fast moving character."
4,Prince of Persia 3-D IDK who doesnt like this game...,ive had PoP 3d for about 3 months now along with Quake but i like this because it brings back the good games & reminds me of a more inventive era of games......:P sorta.... anyway even though i have Windows XP it runs fine on it unlike my dads burned copy of the infernal machine. If you're looking for a puzzle game or an action sword-fightingey type game get this...... if not than get Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine. They're bolth good puzzle action sorta swordy adventure game platformers so go out there & get it if you want to.................
1,Defective,"Didn't work right out of the box. The red indicator light came on but no lights, no matter what I tried. I returned it to the store. Years ago motion sensor lights seemed to be reliable, our old one lasting 15 years. All of the new ones seem to be junk.This light comes with a 10 year warranty but, of course, you have to pay to ship it to them and they require including a check for $7.50 for return shipping."
2,I do not recommend the Potty Pal Elongated seat,"The elongated version is still an inch too short for our standard elongated toilet. The bolts do not fasten down tight so the whole thing is wobbly. The three piece seats do not stay in the upright position for my husband to use the toilet. The toddler seat is the only thing we like. If you can put it on a toilet specific for that use and you don't care about the look of it being too short, it would be fine for that."
3,Got what I wanted,"I wanted a heavy duty square and this certainly is. I don't intend to drop it on my foot soon. One negitive comment though. I have a Rigid bench saw and this was a little tight in the bench slot. With some sanding of the steel shaft I was able to have it working perfectly. A little too much paint.Paul, Avon Co."
2,Boring and overwraught,"This guy can not tell a story to save his life. The first 20 pages are so convoluted, told from so many irrelevant perspectives, and handle the shoehorning in of the myth so awkwardly, it's almost unreadable. I struggled through, but didn't find any of the characters believable or even engaging. Especially Brandin, the so-called ""evil"" ruler who is actually a great, honorable guy and supposed to be sympathetic except for the little fact that he's exterminated an entire nation. None of it hung together. This is one of those books that whenever you see a ""myth"" you gotta say, ""uh-oh, now who is going to find that enchanted rock/sword/ring in about 25 pages, hmmm?"" Also found there to be something vaguely onanistic about an imaginary coutnry named ""The Palm."""
2,Almost a great book.,"My mom gave me this book to read, and when I started reading it I thought it was pretty good. The problem came up when I got about 2/3 of the way through. It seems as though Kay had a great idea and started spending lots of time on it, and then hit a deadline and abruptly gave up on getting a good story finished and instead focused on getting it out the door. There is so much that he could have done with this, and it ended up being very disappointing."
5,Can it get any better?,"Loving the book in which character and plot are perfectly in line, any one will love this one. You wont forget this story anytime soon."
3,Highly ambitious - difficult to read,"I bought the book based on the great reviews at Amazon.com. Overall my view is that this book has high ambition and that there is great potential in the story, but unfortunately I found this book so hard to read that I actually stopped reading it half way through. I also think that it is much too long and that the book were better if it were shorted since in my point of view there is too much unnecessary and superfluous text in there."
1,Badly written,"After reading the other reviews I am apparently very much in the minority, but I found this book to be not well written at all. I only got through the first 100 or so pages and then gave up. The book is full of tortured prose which lectures us for paragraph after paragraph about the protagonists' feelings, reactions, memories, etc. The author also has an annoying habit: when the plot calls for a character to say something clever, he or she comes out with something fairly lame, but the other characters are dumbstruck with admiration. After this happened for the tenth time I finally stopped reading in frustration. Reading this makes me long for Ursula K. LeGuin, whose understated prose *shows* you what the characters are thinking and feeling rather than *telling* you."
1,Very disappointing.,"I had high hopes for this book, especially given all the positive reviews here. However, I found Kay's writing to be incredibly tedious, the characters one-dimensional, and the story rambling. I was really trying my best, but I got halfway through and gave up. Maybe I'll take a break and try to clear my head with Saberhagen's Empire of the East, a much better book."
4,GGK does it again...,"This was the first GG Kay book I ever read, and even though it's not my favorite (I prefer _The Lions of Al-Rassan_ and _A Song for Arbonne_), it's a wonderful book. It's got sweeping epic scope, without ever losing track of the characters its following."
2,Disappointed....,"Tigana was the first book of Guy Gavriel Kay's that I have read. I admit to having high expectations, and also admit, after having finished the book to having been disappointed.First, let me touch on the highpoints: Characterizations of Brandin, Alessan and Devin were splendid. To a lesser degree, other characters (such as Catriana and Baerd) were well realized.However, certain events were either opportunity lost (Catriana's poignant decision and resolution) or without plot-basis (Alessan's romantic interest).In fact, in many, many ways, the best founded protagonist was Brandin and, likewise, Dianora the best characterization.Given that Brandin was (in large part) the antagonist, and Dianora a soul-blighted persona with angst riddled decisions, perhaps I would've enjoyed the book with more focus on them? Or, perhaps, a heavier reason to dislike Brandin then his retribution for having lost his son."
5,its my all time favorite book,"never in all my years of reading have i discovered an author who so vividly paints images in my mind.when he talked about music i could hear it, when he described the smells or sounds i was there.rarely is there an author who can do that.he is unpredictable, something i really look for in an author.i mean,the world will never tire of hearing the traditional fantasy (boy meets girl,boy falls in love with girl, girl gets in trouble, boy saves girl, happily ever after)but sometimes it is nice to have a break. Kay writes so that you will not know the ending until you get there, that i find totaly facinating and thrilling. he incorprates everything that we value as human beings into his works. he has a very good sense as to how much of each emotion he has to put in to it to make it come alive. Kay's books are some of the best i've ever read or am in the process of reading, for even though i've read them all before i don't dare put them down for fear i'll miss the ending."
3,Great but does NOT work with Windows 98SE,"I used to own a 128mb jumpdrive 1.0 and it worked great on all the OSs it claimed to support including Windows 98SE. Unfortunately, I lost it. I decided to go for this larger capacity drive as a replacement. Since one of my computers still runs windows 98se it is important to me that is supports this particular OS. When I went to download the drivers for windows 98se they were not available. Tech support emailed me some drivers, but they did not work either. I then tried it on some other windoows 98se machines at work with the same result. This is my only problem. Otherwise, it has functioned very well for me. If it worked with 98se (as it claims to) i'd give it 5 stars."
1,Drive is Highly Unreliable!,"I purchased this USB drive a year ago in order to transfer data between my work PC and Macs at home. I had no idea that the drive would prove to be so unreliable.It typically takes between 10-20 attempts at inserting/removing the drive until it is recognized (indicated by the LED on the drive flashing a couple times). I would think that it was my OS if it wasn't for the fact that I've encountered the same behavior on the following systems: Windows XP, Windows 2000, Mac OS X 10.3, and Mac OS X 10.4. All behaved the same way.I bought this drive so that I could quickly transfer large files between computers; however, I didn't count on spending 10 minutes attempting to get the drive to be recognized. Unfortunately, at this point I'm just going to have to throw it away and look for a better product."
5,"Fast, reliable, ultra portable, and easy...","I've never written a review, although I very much rely on Amazon reviews for purchasing decisions. Now it's time I finally contribute.After using this product for over a week now, I'm exceedingly impressed by how fast and portable it is. I wear it as a key chain and use it mostly at work, since I have a laptop hooked to my work computer via a KVM switch and the drive is the only way I transfer data back and forth (laptop is offline).Incidentally, I'm not sure what the previous reviewer meant by formatting the drive using NTFS. The only formatting options I get are FAT and FAT32. Nonetheless, this baby is fast!"
3,dead after 1 year,I bought a 256mb drive about a year ago. It worked very well with my powerbook but was rarely detected with Windows ME. IT is more flimsy and bulky compared to other usb drives. Recently it suddenly stopped working completely. No computer can detect it and the flashing light does not come on when plugged into any usb drive. Maybe just a lemon or some bad luck?
5,This book is the first true networking system!,"This book describes the first true networking system. By following the system described in this book you can build an effective, long lasting network of personal and professional relationships that will enable you to grow your business. Successful Business Networking is the only ""true"" networking book!"
5,An astounding feat of world-building.,"The first of The Starbridge Chronicles and it gets off this underappreciated trilogy to an exhilirating start. The world of Paradise is so fully realized that the reader sometimes forgets that s/he is in this one. The world is very surreal and richly detailed, as are the characters that populate the grand drama that unfolds. At the end of the novel the world, the characters, and ultimately the reader have all undergone profound changes. If you dare to escape into this frightening world, you will be richly rewarded and you might even want to tatoo your hand with all kinds of archaic symbols."
3,can't complain.,"the adapter and controllers work, as long as your not using the newer slim version of the PS2."
3,Good Gas Cap,"Great cap, after all it's a Stant. I would recommend you check for the correct part number on the Stant website. For my '68 Cougar the Amazon part search and the Stant page came up with different part numbers and the Stant number matched my worn out Stant that fits. I'm not sure if the Amazon part number cap would have worked or not.Update:A short time after installing this gas cap I began to notice gas fumes while I was working in my trunk. I was concerned that I may not have good connections on my filler pipe but I eventually traced the source of fumes to the rubber gasket on this locking gas cap. It doesn't fit the filler tightly. I replaced the cap with the standard, non-locking Stant OE type gas cap for my car and it works perfectly - no more fumes escaping. I've downgraded the locking cap from 5 to 3 stars. I'm tempted to give it 2 stars but Stant generally makes very high quality stuff and I'm not entirely sure why this cap didn't fit well."
4,"A few cuts missing, but a great collection!","This is a great trip down memory lane for me. I have three Slade LPs, this one, ""Slayed"" and ""Slade Alive!"". All of them are outstanding examples of 1970's era pub rock by the band that defined the genre. These guys are loud, obnoxious, and right in stride with their material. This CD is a perfect example of their songs. It deserves 5 stars, but I'm more than a little ticked off because the import version does not include ""My Friend Stan"" and more importantly, ""My Town"", one of my favorite Slade songs. I haven't been able to find ""My Town"" (which was included on the US release of ""Sladest"") on any of the ""best of"" CDs. However, this import version contains six songs that were NOT included on the US LP, so I suppose that kinda makes up for it. I recommend this CD to anyone. Put it on and and exceed your receiver's volume ratings. You'll love it."
3,A Naive Herione in a Stylish Setting,"Emily Stanton is loosely based on the real-life Vivian Gordon, who took on Tammany and lost in the heyday of its corrupt life. Emily's story is a bit different than Vivian's, and Stadiem and Bugliosi's descriptions of New York in the 20's and 30s - the gamblers, speakeasies and theatres, certainly makes for a page-turner of a story. Unfortunately, however, even if Emily couldn't see what was going to happen to her 10 pages, or 50 pages, ahead of time, I could, and that makes for an ultimately unsatisfying read. I would prefer to be surprised by a story, rather than muttering to myself ""don't go there, Emily!"" The novel is definitely worth reading for the backdrop of New York during Prohibition, with its descriptions of Texas Guinan, Arnold Rothstein and Tammany in all their seedy glory."
2,Shoot the production company,"I have reviewed this film previously, and have waited for the DVD...alas, it is a big disappointment. No widescreen and no extras...in otherwords, a waste of time and money. Small, but important films such as this are poorly served by production companies who serve up a barely adequate product. This is a very good film, but the DVD is a dud. Buy the VHS in protest!"
4,Unique,"Ever wonder how historic peoples would react to today's modern society? This is the basic idea of the movie. Their reactions are believable and well portrayed. It's almost paradoxical how you can see their situation from a modern society dweller, yet also understand their point of view, but the acting makes it easy to emphasize with them. Also, the movie is very visually appealing, filled with darkness and mist. The music is well matched. The whole movie is engrossing and suspenseful, and the conclusion doesn't disapoint. Coincidently, the Lyons live here in Halifax, Canada. A lot of people at work consider it a classic but she seems tired of talking about it. Lately she's been producing some TV series for kids (life in different countries)."
4,A fantastic pilgramage! I call for higher-budget remake!,"The Navigator is a great movie, although the plot seems cloudy at times and the movie too short. After watching it I was left wanting more. I would definately like to see a higher-budget remake of The Navigator: A Medieval Odessy. The idea of pious medieval peasants really time traveling to the modern day makes for a story of adventure and fantasy. One full of human moments and perhaps even a little humor. How will modern day priests react to these pilgrams? and their story? These are just a few things I was left wanting to see. I recommand renting this movie first. Then decide for yourself if its worth owning."
1,Expense bandaid for bad software and website,"I own the Garmin 405 with HRM. It is beyond me why anyone would be happy with buying a foot pod. The correct answer is for Garmin to allow manual entries and the editing of data on Garmin Connect and Training Center. This deficiency means that if you are running, biking, or working out indoors you are forced to pay $100 to log your workout.Oh - and if you complete an ""indoor cardio"" workout like biking that doesn't involve any impact then the foot pod will not work and you still can not log your workout.The 405 is a solid product, the Garmin Connect and Training Center are buggy and deficient, and the foot pod is a complete rip off. Open a Garmin Connect account for yourself and prepare to be underwhelmed.Taylor"
3,Too soon to tell,I am hopeful that this product will do what they say it will do. I have been taking it for about 3 weeks and it may be too soon to tell.
4,Worth the $ if you can find it!,"Excellent book about a courageous man. Factual and to the point, much better than the Walking Tall movies. Buford Pusser stood up to the corruption that so pervaded southwest Tennessee in the 1960s. This is an excellent book. There is a sequel to ""The 12th of August"" by W.R. Morris, titled simply, ""Buford"". It is probably more difficult to obtain than the 12th of August. It basically starts off where the 12th of August left off, even containing information about Buford's death (which I believe was caused by foul play). Buford's only biological daughter, Dwana Pusser, has a website with a plethora of information about Buford, stories, etc.. Buford was truly a one of a kind."
2,Not the best in the series,"Warlords 2 was a great game. Simple, elegant. Warlords 3 is not a great game. Stay away."
1,Don't bother,"I found this offering terribly wanting; illustrating concepts with material (the mushrooms database) that was not available without a significant amount of effort -- no CD or website with sample data.In my opinion, this book included way too much VB code of questionable value. If you wnat to learn about data mining, look elsewhere. If you want to use the Microsoft code libraries to manipulate the analysis services object models, this book might be helpful.It seems to me that the author could have done a better job with the statistical concepts. Noteworthy are the formulae for standard deviations (p.328) which just did not seem to jibe with the actual calculations in the example."
5,My husband loves this!,"This Leatherman is exactly what my husband was looking for. Very useful and versatile, not too heavy, and the belt clip is very secure."
5,Leatherman tool,A present for someone and he uses it almost everyday. Very well made. The delivery was quick and the product was great. Would recommend to anyone
3,Not as solid as my new Supertool 300,"I recently bought the Supertool 300 - it was my first Leatherman multi-tool. I am ecstatic with it. That led me to buy the new Surge, mostly because of the easy exterior access to the knives and other tool. I thought, perhaps, I hadn't bought the 'top of the line' model. I was completely underwhelmed with the Surge. On paper it seemed to have the better features, and updated design. It just doesn't feel as solid as my 300. It rattles when I close it, the scissors don't lock into place, and it just doesn't feel like it'll stack up over time and abuse to the 300. I returned it to Amazon, and bought a new leather sheath for my 300 instead ;)"
4,Can't live without it,As a sailboat owner this product is indespensible. My only reservation is the saw OR the file can be part of the unit.
3,gifted to another,"It is a nice set for the price, for someone who enjoys serving on stainless steel. Recipient seemed to like the set."
4,2nd machine,"This is my 2nd machine.. I bought a smaller one about 10 yrs ago.. It is time to retire it, so decided to purchase a larger one. My family just loves the homemade pasta.. It will take a few times to get used to working the dough but in the end it will be worth it... The raves you will receive from family and friends is the best.."
1,Save your dough!,"we are very dissappointed in this machine. once extruding, the dough leaks from the side damper. we have yet been able to extrude a full batch because the gluten developes and disables the 'drop into the extrusion hole' design. this is a significant design flaw. It is challenging to clean even after allowing the dough to dry before scraping. I'm sorry I asked Santa for this machine."
2,Comes in with grease all over,"We did not even try this one as it shipped to our home, after the opening, the machine is all covered with lubricating oil. We just requested a return for health concerns."
3,An emotional look inside the emergency room,"This is a short little book, but it packs a powerful emotional punch. The author describes her experiences as a hospital volunteer at the Mobile General Hospital, and explains why she finds this work rewarding, in spite of the emotional and physical stresses involved. Her portrayal of the emergency room is dead-on, and while her story is flavored by her religious beliefs, this book does a great job of explaining what its like to work in this chaotic environment."
4,a great cover of a great soundtrack,"This cover of the ""Pretty In Pink"" soundtrack is very well done. I am a huge fan of this film and its soundtrack and was very pleased by the covers on this album. Each band takes a song from the original soundtrack and adds their own unique twist to it rather than serving up a mundane regurgitation of the original version. In my opinion, the most noteworthy performances are Tom Racer on ""If You Leave,"" Tresspassers William on ""Left of Center,"" and Danny Dean and the Homewreckers on ""Pretty In Pink."" I highly recommend this album to anyone who loves the film and its music!"
3,there are production issues for series one,"Although the series is excellent as expected, there were scratches on disc one and three of series one, interestingly the replacement discs had scratches in exactly the same places, like there was some problem associated with their production, if you purchase season one prepare to have to have them resurfaced."
4,Great Book,My husband is one of Betty's nephews.All of the sisters had an incredible wit about them - probably because of their mother Sidney Bard. She did a wonderful job raising her children with out her beloved husband Darcy. It's too bad the children and grandchildren didn't learn lessons from Betty's books. She would be sad to see the way the family turned out.
5,Witty and So True!,Once you begin to read betty you will seek her out in every used bookstore in the country. She is addictive. She tells about life in the northwest in such a wonderful and truthfull way! She is a pessimest and is readily able to admit it. She will make you laugh until you are crying. Start with the egg and I and take off.
1,Worst movie ever made.,3 hours of my life that I will never get back! Don't waste your time or money watching this turd
2,Not a Giant,One of the worst movies ever made about Texas and Texans. Dreadful. Awful. Laughable acting and a silly script. Boring but good for a laugh. James Dean as a Texas cowboy indeed.
1,This is Texas?,"I recently decided to view this film. Let's see - a reference to Neiman-Marcus - some wide open spaces, some cattle and oil wells. O.K. - but this film does not really tell about Texas and Texans. Thankfully, Chill Wills (from Seagoville, TX) was in it. He was the most Texan thing about this film. I wish I had something more positive to say - but I don't."
1,Not recommended,"I have a 2 1/2 and 1 1/2 year old and I don't care for this stroller. The main issue is that there are no shoulder straps, it only has a belt strap so both kids like to try to stand up while they are in it. Based on that issue alone, I would not buy this again.On the plus side, it is relatively light, as double strollers go, and that was the main reason that we purchased it. It's light enough that I can lift it in and out of my trunk without my husband's assistance."
2,No more!!,"UPDATE: I still don't like this record, but Josh has won me over with his new one, The Historical Conquests of Josh Ritter. He finally learned to put his poetic lyrics to music in a compelling, rockin' way. I can't wait to hear what he comes up with next.Here is what I originally said about this record:I continue my campaign to get all these mopey guys who are so heavily influenced by Nick Drake and Elliott Smith to go ahead and follow their example a little more closely.Okay, that sounds a bit harsh, but I really mean musically, not the other thing. There are some good songs on here but they are desperatly in need of someone to arrange some decent music and some less monotonous singing. I mean, even if Drake and Smith sounded like they were on 'ludes, there was a certain complexity to their music. A non-English-speaker would be hardpressed to differntiate one song from another on this album.Whatever you do, don't play this for a coma patient."
2,Minty,Unfortunatly minty and as my son has a great aversion to mint not a good choice as does not say mint flavoured on the description
5,Foreign music,"This is a really good CD. Some are pop tunes, but no drastic deviations from the Greek flavored music style."
1,"Boring, uninspired wallpaper","This album excels at one thing: it shows us that playing and compositional skills are not necessary for releasing an album and making money. The ""minimal"" guitar passages are probably played by someone who has never seen a guitar before. The music is bland and unispired, and even the ambient/experimental textures are done by default.Excuse me, but I have nothing else to say, except that if you want some atmospheric post-rock, go and buy The Earth is Not A Cold Dead Place by Explosions in the Sky."
5,For the Price Could Not Be Beat!,"I was very happy to find this mouse and catch it at such a great price. Works flawlessly. I know corded mouses are out, but the reliability is great. Note: If you use in your bedroom, the red light can be a little bright. I actually blocked it out, but its cause I like my room pitch black when I sleep."
3,A deception,"Ruth Rendell is one of the First Ladies of Misteries but this book of short tales falls short of possible expectations from such a star; small stories, some obvious, and looks like she wrote mementoes in her pocket book to write novels with those subjects, but never maneged to do them. OK, not so good tales from Ruth Rendell are better than some misteries from other writers, but there is no comparison between this book and her others, writing either as Ruth Rendell or Barbara Vine"
3,Time to move on...,"This book was probably good in it's time, but what it really helped me to do was realize I needed to upgrade to Photoshop Elements."
3,It's illegal,"The Pampered Chef stoneware is awesome.However, the people selling these products online are breaking their contracts with the Pampered Chef company! AND, as other reviewers have stated you pay MORE here than with Pampered Chef and there is no warranty here!"
3,Mediocre,It was the type of book that you started reading but if something else more exciting came along you could put it down and decide to return to it later.That says to me not a great book
4,Go at your own pace.,"Even those of us who love to get lost in a good, long read, often appreciate the short story as a change of pace. I felt as if I too were journeying through London on the Tube, peeking into the lives of my fellow (or should I say ""sister"" ) commuters. This book is for everyone who ever sat bored on a train, imagining storylines for everyone sitting nearby!"
2,Renamed version of a book I already own,"I was disappointed to discover this is Victoria Line, Central Line. I've already bought a paperback version of that collection of short stories so wouldn't have bought it again had I not been mislead by the change of title. It's a little unfair of the publishers to rename it and let you think you're buying a different book."
3,A solid hits album.,"Okay, so if you know anything about Chris de Burgh, you know all the words to ""Spanish Train"", and you can bawdy down with a boa and a high-volume version of ""Patricia the Stripper"" when you've had enough to drink. Maybe you even played ""In a Country Churchyard"" at your wedding. If you already are, or applying to be, a CDB fan, then this album is a must for you. It's got enough to get you moving in the right direction, at least, since there are so many to collect if you are a die-hard. Buy this and turn it up in the car -- at least the cop who pulls you over for speeding to ""Spanish Train"" will be impressed."
5,lost customer #,"i recieved a defective cd from moviemars and would like to exchange it,cant because i dont have my customer number."
4,dark and enticing,"This thriller captures you from the first chapter. Very dark and mysterious. In modern times, the end of this story probably seems predictable, but I think Collins was ahead of his time, and I'm sure that people reading this story in the 1800's never would have guessed what ""the secret"" really was. This story itself is so interesting that it doesn't really matter whether or not you figure out the ending. It's the journey that really counts here. It was so captivating that I could hardly put it down, and I finished it in 5 days."
1,"Great concept, but it doesn't work","The mouse has a very cute face and tail, the wireless remote control is also cutely designed. When the mouse does run, it runs fairly easily with the controls and moves in enticing patterns. However, the cons far outweigh any pros. First and most importantly, the charge only stays for about one minute before it runs out, which is obviously way to short for any type of play session with your cats. Also, the wheels pick up cat hair fairly easily and can impede the mouse's movement. It's not worth getting up and re-charging the mouse over and over again for what you get out of it. Going to have to say save your money on this one, definitely not worth it."
1,Waste of money!,"I cant believe this toy costs over $15!! I struggled for over half an hour to get it on the ""charger,"" battery only lasts about 30 seconds once it starts and there's a useless ""forward"" button on the control that does nothing. But the worst part is that it scared my cat :("
3,Didn't last long,"The cat was afraid of this at first and was more of a toy for the cat's owners. Once the cat took interest in this product, the remote control's small parts broke off. Just a cheap product to keep humans entertained that doesn't work for very long."
2,Mixed Bag,"I would love to give this collection 5 stars because there are so many good movies included here. There is at least 10 movies in this collection from either Quentin Tarantino's top 20 spaghetti westerns list or the Spaghetti Western Database top 20 list (including runner ups). However none of the films I watched are remastered. The quality is terrible. If you dont mind watching unremastered movies then I suggest buying this because there are good films. But if you want to see high quality remastered versions of the films like I do, then you are better off just buying the individual dvds of the movies worth watching."
3,Trash and Treasures,"As the other reviewers note, the quality of some of the transfers is quite poor. China 9 Liberty 37 is the horrible TV movie version with numerous edits. The DVD of this Monte Hellman film ends a good 5 minutes shy of the conclusion, simply cutting off during the shootout at Warren Oates' homestead and returning to the Main Menu. As previously noted, there are some treasures: Django Kill, Run Man Run for example. I'm a Tomas Milian fan and got my fill here."
1,Really disappointed,"First when I saw the titles I was very excited to own this collection of movies which made me dream during my late childhood and early teenage but then when I got them and viewed them what a disappointment! Some movies did not run at at all, others had sound issues as if the dubbing actors were speaking in a hallway, and the worst is the video quality: very poor, very mediocre!The company that realeased these DVDs could have done a better job (by the way, the DVD menu look very amateurish and raises questions as to who these people really are)Now I am convinced that the people who bought this collection and did not return it right away are die hard spaghetti western fans."
2,Broke in under a month,"I got this to keep my 2.5 y.o. son from messing up my beige leather seats (that wasn't my first choice of interior color) in my new car. It worked great for about 3 weeks, but at that point, he gave it one last kick and one side of the top attachment broke off. It isn't worth repairing and I am getting one that's made a little better. (I will review that when I get it, but I am trying the Mickey Mouse toy holder sold on Amazon.)If your child isn't quite as energetic in the car, it might be fine. But if your toddler doesn't do a lot of kicking, you're probably not shopping for this type of item. I wish they'd make items like this to last. I'd pay more to find something that I wouldn't have to replace often."
5,A Sicilian Treasure,"As the Daughter of Sicilian Imigrants, I am naturally cautious of books that claim to be about a culture I know well and the land I think of as my second home. This book is wonderful! It has the rich history of Sicily interspersed with Recipies that are as my own mother made them. The real thing! It is written with great fondness of the Island and of its people. My father, of 88 enjoyed the book also.. saying that much of the history is how he remembers it from tales told to him by my great and great great grandparents. My advise is .. If you love Sicily, the history culture and food.. this book is a must have. It is a joyous work that Simeti has crafted well! My thanks to her!"
5,A Classic,"Most of the reviewers discuss the characters of this book and the romance, and I agree with their assessments that this book is excellent on that score. However, the main reason this book is good is that it artfully demonstrates how the characters were changed by World War I. As the book begins, the characters are interested in society, social conventions, getting married, etc. They expect WWI to be over quickly. It is not, and the way it affects the people and the society makes this book a real standout. I bought this book when it was first published and recently re-read it, which says a lot, because I rarely re-read fiction. This book delivers much more than its cover indicates."
5,Beautiful illustrations to a classic tale!,"I have loved this story since I was a little girl, and wanted to find it for my own daughter. It is such a wonderful tale of love and devotion. I highly reccommend this book for any fairy tale lover!"
2,its ok...,"The only good part about Zoids: Battle Legends is you get to customize your zoid. The battle mode is way hard for a beginner. Even if you spend all the money they give you in the game, taking on two opponents at the same time is very hard. Having a partner in the game is hard too. You have to make sure hes helping you. If you dont control him too, he just runs around and you get beat up and lose. I would not recommend this game. Spend your money on a better game!!"
1,Warning,"I own the original Seatrain album on record and have even transfered several of the songs to tape and have listened to them for years. These are not those performances. They are very close, but slightly different. It's as if the real performers rerecorded the songs to carefully copy themselves. Or a different take from the same session. As nostalgia, which is one of the reasons I bought this album, this rates a zero. I feel ripped off."
5,Awesome!,"This movie is a classic. If you've never seen it, now is the time! Several of the other versions are also worth seeing."
1,Another Disgusting Warner Blu-ray Transfer,As with King Kong Warner has produced a Blu-ray transfer to DVD with grain as thick as peas soup. I will never buy another Warner Blu-ray DVD. This company is a disgrace when it comes to transfers of older films to Blu-ray DVD. Please do not buy anything put out on Blu-ray by Warner.
5,"Wonderful movie, great acting, historically inaccurate!","Bligh's name has entered the English language as a synonym for cruelty. In reality he flogged his men less than did most of the British captains in the South Pacific in the 1800's. Bligh served under Captain Cook and continued Cook's humane reforms for the sailors (better food and sanitation, etc). For a more balanced view of Bligh and Fletcher Christian, read MR. BLIGH'S BAD LANGUAGE. In the meantime, myth outlives history. I still love this movie!"
5,Great Film,"I had to order/watch this for a film class and was expecting a boring documentary, but this is not boring in the slightest!I was soooo interested in this movie. The directors/edittors were so facinating and they showed awesome clips/shots to give examples of the types of editting and what was done in scenes.My sister walked by as I was watching it and within 5 seconds she was glued to the screen too.I would recommend this movie for anyone who's a big movie watcher."
3,Brought back memories,"This Maya figure brought back the memories for me.... not sure why the head is sooo big, but the costume is authentic... Not really for playing with because seems a big fragile... collectors should enjoy it. Boots where not fitting well, so when I took them off to see why found that both feet where broken on the side where the foot would attach to the ankle... not sure if this was/is standard or not, but was not a big deal."
5,No fuss. Works as advertised,"When you have to pop the cover off your computer, all bets are off. Usually a 10-minute job drags into 2 hours if not two days. This card works as advertised. I dropped it into the motherboard, my old Windows 2000 computer instantly recognized it and I was on the internet without the slightest hiccup.I've been in technology for a long time and believe me, fuss-free products don't happen by accident. That's why they are few and far between. Very satisfied :-)"
5,Challenges of women in the 60's and 70's,"This is an autobiographical account of a womans' childhood and although 'Zippy' is the main character of the story, the book is also a story outlining her Mothers' transformation from a housewife, making the best of things as they were setup for her by her own preconceived ideas, to a well-rounded person in charge of her own life. Ultimately, the entire family feels the impact, both good and bad from the changes that occur. This book is both entertaining and thought-provoking!"
4,Into the realm of Dub,"Righteous and enchanting. Zion Train are one of Britains best live acts and multi-talented individuals besides. Check-out track 2 ""Building Rome"", the most profound statement of many on Tony Blairs ""New London"" and the Millennim Projects. If you like dub, buy this. If you want to be politicized, buy this. Not so much the brass in this one, this is deep dub."
4,Bride left (at) the altar,"Betty Stanhope, the beautiful bride walked down the aisle with head bowed in sadness and despair. Just as the minister started to speak, Betty looked at her bridegroom and then fell to a little white heap upon the floor. They took her to an anteroom where a physician proclaimed her fit. While they prepared to resume the wedding, Betty fled out the back door (the exit of the title), and thus starts the chase. Betty knows no one she can turn to, so must decide which strangers to trust. Thus an exciting adventure ensues. Grace Livingston Hill is the most copied writer in the Christian Romance genre, and is in fine form here."
4,I hope this game is great!,"If this is how i hope it will be, it will be a great game. I know that there will be customizable zoids and time travel and all that stuff, but i want to know if you can control your zoids like in a real time strategy game. Well im pretty much out of thoughts besides this being a great game, so cya around mates!"
2,Tiny little thing,"I bought this as a possible favor for my 6-year-old son's Spy Training sleepover party, thinking it would be fun for the boys to run around with in the dark. But, it is tiny (about the length of my thumb) and really more like a red light than anything else. As someone else mentioned, you can see very little through the ""lense."" My son used it for a couple minutes as a ""laser,"" and then abandoned it. For a couple dollars more, we are going with the Night Vision Goggles by the same company, which are actually binocular-sized and have many more features."
2,it is not the best to get it,hi this is Zachary i got this 4 my birthday and it makse my dog heid very crasy look down 6 spasis down but its fun!!!!!PPS do not by its horubll
4,An admirer of the product,"Personally i find that the technologies in this product incredibly advanced for its price normally, i mean it costs me more to buy Mc Donalds than this. Im incredibly impressed with the efficiency off the product and i thank u for making it so affordable."
1,Horrid,"Unfortunately I bought the trilogy after reading The Other Boleyn Girl thinking that all of this authors works would be good. I was wrong. I read this book and the start of the next, The Favored Child, and it is all disgusting. Honestly, I don't know who would enjoy this kind of rag."
1,"Awful, sick and twisted.","WideAcre and Favored Child are a huge waste of time. I finally decided not to pollute my mind with even finishing Favored Child. The subject matter with all the incest is just sick and wrong. Phillippa Gregory, please stick with historical fiction on the likes of Queens Fool, and the other period books of King Henry VIII."
2,Disappointingly Miserable,"This book did not live up to Gregory's later book, Meridon. I don't know about Wideacre because I haven't read it yet but reading The Favored Child made me not want to go back to the first book.Julia is just an idiot. I felt really bad for her but she kind of just screwed herself over throughout the entire story. And nothing good ever came out of all of her struggles.It left me with a really disturbed, and unsatisfied feeling. I do not recommend this novel."
3,very interesting tale,"These are set into their event eras very well,with interesting details about their time and place, and the plot line is really interesting: complex but pretty believable across the three book series. The writing is only ok however, or maybe it's the editing which has given the books an uneven pace-too slow here and there, but gaps in detail in other places."
4,Timely Read,"A well paced and interesting read. Conquerors Road is a gripping journey through events at the end of WW2. Importantly, many facets of war journalism are discussed, and this is extremely pertinent in the current political climate. To the younger reader such as myself it gives a great impression and sense of the time and events of WW2, and with this the reader can get a good perspective on the recent events in Iraq and especially issues around their reportage.I really liked the flow of the book, which is understated and progressive - it was difficult to put down. The events unfold naturally, and the distance between 1945 and the present is greatly reduced.There are some strong descriptions about conditions and the depravity which occured in the war, and these have a lasting impact. The book is an effective window to the past."
3,The Truth About This CD,"Some of you may have noticed the Single Version of ""Nightmare On My Street"" was listed on the CD. I am writing this review to warn everybody out there: SINGLE VERSION IS A LIE!!!! The original version of ""Nightmare On My Street"" is included instead. ""The Fresh Pfince Of Bel Air"" is much longer than the TV version we've all become emotionally attached to. Why wasn't the original version of ""Nod Ya Head"" included? But there is some good news: the radio edit of ""Wild Wild West"" was included. Overall, it's an OK collection."
4,Good Bang For Your Buck,This is a pretty good greatest hits collection and if you like Will Smith's style you'll enjoy it. The only quibble is that it substitutes the rather bland remix of Nod Yer Head instead of the rocking soundtrack version from the movie. Oh well.
4,Worth every penny,"This is the first original English book I read in whole and I enjoyed reading it very much. Of course it is not enough to know America in such a short account. But for anyone as I was who is new to the States and its language, this book is a wonderful start. Its language is kinda poetic and fit for telling the westward stories that was before the big crash in 1929. Recommended for foreigners beginning to study English and History of the US."
1,Need More Light and a Magnifying Glass on the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali,"I just received this book so I cannot review it yet in terms of content. However, I was very disappointed with the print quality of the book. It looks like the original book was photocopied at least three times and then reprinted to create this book. The fonts are all ballooned out and blotchy. Some of the letters are only partially printed and then fade out. I can't believe that Amazon would charge $30.00 for a book with substandard print quality. I do plan to keep it, however, because I want to learn the Yoga Sutras from B.K.S. Iyengar's perspective. We'll see if it is worth the effort to read. I 'll need a magnifying glass for some of it"
1,fooled,"No info on this bk tells you that it is written in a foreign language! All of the description is in English--the cover is in English, the text is in ?. I needed this bk for a seminar and waited and waited and waited for it to arrive. Now I must go thru the humbug of returning it! The same thing happened to another yoga friend. I laughed when it happened to her. Not funny now. Beware."
4,It was a pretty good book,"In 1864 Coyote Runs, a boy of the Apache, joins his first raid to become a man. While he is in a canyon he is shot in the head.About 100 years later a 15 year old boy named Brennan Cole.He finds the skull and becomes obsessed with it. He feels he must bury it at a sacred spot in the canyon. His adventure becomes the biggest challenge of his life. I feel that this book was very good. I especially liked the plot and the Apache history behind it. If you like adventure with a twist of fantasy and history you should read this book."
2,Disappointed,"I really liked the Outsiders but this book was not very good. It seemed liked it was rushed through the whole thing and I didnt feel a connection with any of the characters. I was halfway through the book and it seemed like nothing had happened except a fight and some walking around. At the end I was confused and disappointed. It seemed like it just cut short and I wanted to know what happened to Rusty.(I cant even remember the second part to his name and I just finished the book this morning, thats how unconnected it was)I would not recomend this book to anyone. The Outsiders was sooooo much better!"
1,Christmas Music from the Headache Factory,"I LOVE Christmas. I love the festive atmosphere. I love the spirit of giving and I love Christmas music.This stuff, however, is downright painful to listen to. A few tracks, with the slower tempo, can be tolerated in small doses, but the more ""upbeat"" number are too awash in synthesizer arrangements and come across as little more than ""a disco Christmas"" and severely test my love for the music of the season. Destined for shopping mall PA systems everywhere."
5,Islam: Fact or Fiction,"Esposito does a fine job of relating Islam to the lay person. His text is easy to read, the definitions are solid and he dispells much of the myth surrounding Islam. The newest text references 9/11 and the radical sects which have surfaced since then.I would highly recommend this text to teachers and students alike; as well as those who are simply looking for a way to properly understand the history, beliefs and laws of Islam."
4,Database programming LITE...Just scratching the surface.,"Light weight apporach to programming without becomming too heavy. Class room approach is a refreshing change to other books. Plenty of VB programming reinforcement by repetition, which for some may become tedious. Very basic book and and execellent beginner series. If you have some previous experience working with Visual Basic you can easily by-pass his first book and start with this one. The author does introduce some minor information on features not found in the Learning or Working Model editions of Visual Basic. (Such as Masked Edit Controls) But provides enough in formation so as to be able to utilize them if available to you. Author also concentrates heavily on one older method of Database programming. Book lacks any explination detailing use of other database control methods suct as Active X but does provide excellent fundamentals. At the end of the book you will be hungry for more but not starving....."
1,This book is aweful,"This is the worst computer programming book I have ever come across. I kid you not, the entire book is written like a story. The author ends or begins EVERY sentence with ""I said"" throughout the entire book. For example, ""Why do you call it the default?"" Barbara asked. ""Well, I said, ""this is the appearance of the toolbox."" It takes a lot of thought processing just to figure out who is talking and the ""I said"" gets extremely annoying after awhile to the point where you just can't stand reading it anymore."
2,Could Be Better,I felt that this movie was boring and corney! I ended up turning it off half way through.
1,Disappointing,"After bringing three bad copies of this movie home from a local retailer, I decided to order it in hopes of getting a good copy of the movie. No such luck. This copy goes blank at the same point that the other three did; in the middle of the restaurant scene. Its hardly seems worthwhile to keep trying to buy this DVD."
1,Utter Garbage,This is the worst war film I have ever viewed. It is flawed in every respect. The acting is shoddy...the special effects are absolutely childlike. The helicopter crashing scene rates as the most amatuerish scene I have ever witnessed on screen. John Wayne is a favourite of mine...I just can't find any redeeming fetures at all. Give this a wide berth.
1,At least it's not Apocalypse now,"I give this movie 1 star and 1 star only. 2 reasons. It's the lowest one you can pick, 2, at least someone tried to improve the name or image of Vietnam vets to biased crowd durring the war. Not a good representation of the Vietnam war, but thanks for trying Duke"
5,john wayne amercan icon,this is just one of his great movies. outstanding movie. great supporting cast . he wanted to depict the ragdety of the vietnam war.
2,movie purchase,transaction went smoothly. purchased for my spouse who is a fan and was very pleased with the addition to our collection
1,Do NOT buy The Green Berets [DVD] from Amazon,"I ordered The green Berets on March 11, 2012. Unfortunately due to having a busy life and having ordered almost a hundred movies in the past couple of months, I did not watch The Green Berets until April 26, 2012. The movie was new. The movie will not play past 1.15.46. I tried cleaning the DVD. My DVD player will play all other DVD's. This DVD is Defective.""Return Window expired on April 21, 2012.""So I am stuck with this piece of Total Junk.Up to this time I was happy with Amazon.Apparently I should not buy DVD's from Amazon as the Return Window forces me to watch the movie within less than 2 months after I order it.My opinion, this is a Nasty policy. I am used to J C Penney's. And Sears used to stand behind Everything they sold for life.So I have learned a lesson about Amazon. Check out EVERYTHING one buys from Amazon IMMEDIATELY~!~!~!PS I love the move The Green Berets. I just hate this DEFECTIVE DVD that Amazon stuck me with~!~!~!The Green Berets"
5,A Rugged History Lesson,"John Wayne stays true to form in this early view of the Viet Nam War. Full of action and intrigue as it takes a look at the Green Berets in battle.At the time John Wayne made this motion picture, The Viet Nam War was controversial and the critics numbered many. John Wayne took on the critics and the task of portraying an unpopular war in our nation's history. This movie is for those fans who love John Wayne in the thick of battle."
4,a solid war flick,"Right off the bat, I'll just say that this movie could've used some better editing and better directing.I own about 30+ war movies on DVD and about 30 more on VHS, nd in my opinion, this is a very solid movie. In regards to movies about Vietnam, it's not anywhere near as beautiful as ""Apocalypse Now,"" nor is it as battle-oriented as ""We Were Soldiers,"" but I'd still take this movie over ""Platoon"" or ""Hamburger Hill"" anyday.I don't know why so many people are saying this movie showed us a ""glorious"" Vietnam. Maybe they missed such scenes where one of the American soldiers gets impaled on a VC boobytrap. Yeah, really glorious.My only REAL problem with this movie (aside from editing issues) are the Vietcong costumes. I'm used to seeing those black ""uniforms"" baggy (not tight), and I'm much more used to seeing those large straw hats. Instead, they were wearing little Gilligan hats. The NVA uniforms looked a little more accurate however."
2,Hoped for More,"I bought this book hoping to find some interesting tips and insights into the use of Cubase, i.e.,things not clearly explained or missing from the Cubase documentation. In the several years I've used Cubase, I know I've discovered many things that I felt were not that well explained or missing in the documentation, and I was curious to see what another experienced user might have found.I've only had the book a day or two, but so far and I'm pretty disappointed. The book seems to be mostly a rehash of the Cubase documentation.Still, in a reference book like this, who knows when one will come across that one tip that justifies the price of the book. I hope that I will eventually find several such tips."
1,Harriet and Walt,"Shame on this author. Children learn name calling fast enough without books encouraging it. Unless you want your preschooler calling you a ""jerk"" or ""dummy"", you'd do best to avoid this book. Luckily we got our copy from the library. We'll be avoiding this author from now on."
5,Best of Bogey,"Quite simply the best performance of a true legend. I am stunned that this is not out on DVD. Rated in the Top 100 by the AFI, this classic is way overdue for recognition."
1,Bootleg version of Treasure of Sierra Madre,"Buyers Beware!! I purchased this DVD and discovered much to my disappointment that I did not receive the movie, I got some bootleg movie about the making of this movie. It was supposed to have been a 2 disc set but I only received the one disc. Hopefully, they will do the right thing and refund my money!"
3,Bogarts Best,"This is one of the best low budget films around, You had to be a very good Actor to bring life to these movies. Boggy did just that !!!!"
2,Me too; this is not the movie.,"This is not the movie; I was expecting the movie. This item is labeled ""Disk Two"". It is several documentaries about John Huston and his movies. Interesting, but not what I ordered. Where is ""Disk One,"" which I suppose is the movie?"
5,A timeless story and great acting.,"This is one of the greatest stories ever to come out of Hollywood. I never get tired of watching this masterpiece. The 3 central characters are thrown together by fate and each has their own strengths and weaknesses. We see them suffer through good times and bad and how each responds in their own unique way. A tremendous study of the human psyche. They don't make movies like this anymore because how can you even come close to this fine effort! Today's jaded audience may not even have the patience to sit through this film because there is no mind blowing special effects, cussing, sex, or graphic violence. This is a gem from the classic era when films centered around powerful acting performances playing out a great story line that made an audience think and follow along. I can't praise this movie highly enough, see it at any cost."
4,"Bill's review of ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre""","I had seen this movie many years ago and had forgotten how greatit was. Bogart showed his fine acting ability in this film as well asall of his films. It is always a pleasure and a treat to view his filmsand feel the character he is playing ""come to life."" Makes me sad to knowhe will never make any more movies. I know I can depend on Amazon to supplythe great movies of the past."
5,A Bogart Classic,Bogart at his best. John Huston at his best. The cast of characters were perfect for the story. This is one of the few westerns I own. The story is greed and its result. The story is old as time. The story & film are worth it. Buy it!
5,No need to relate the plot; it's too well-known.,"JUst like Casablanca and African Queen, if you have even the slightest interest in film history, this is a must-see and must-own. End of story"
4,"Like ""Old School? Check this out!","I first heard of Imagination when their single ""Just An Illusion"" was being played on the radio during my freshman year. Imagination's falsetto based sound reminds me of the work of earlier groups like Blue Magic & The Delphonics, but definitely with that post disco early 80's synthesized feel. ""Just An Illusion"" (my favorite cut, also featured in the movie ""F/X"") has a laid back finger snapping danceable groove. ""Changes"" is another great cut that will get your head noddin'. ""In the Heat of the Night,"" great music but the lyrics didn't make much sense to me. ""Heart and Soul"" and ""Music and Lights"" are also good tunes. ""All I Want to Know,"" ""One More Love"" and""All Night Lovin'"" sound a little ""sleepy"" to me but that's just my opinion! Too bad the group's now defunct. Overall, this is a pretty good CD!"
3,In the Heat of the Night...,"Personally, I found ""In the Heat of the Night"" a good disc! I am just biased for ""Body Talk (4 stars)."" I bought both discs together (just to cover myself!). Believe me, I didn't waste my money! If you can get them for a good price, please purchase ""In the Heat of the Night"" together with ""Body Talk"" and run your own comparison. In my view, you won't regret it! Three stars!"
4,A reveiw of DragonBall Z Budokai 2,"I think this is a great game for all DragonBall Z fans. WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD.DO NOT READ IF YOU DONT HAVE THE GAME YET OR YOU HAVEN""t FINISHED. I think the only flaw is that , before the game came out I read that there were,''whatif'', fusions in the game. But of course there was, but only 2!! And all the other fusions were real . But other than that it is a great game!!Have fun playing it=)"
4,A True DBZ Fan Game,"I cant wait for this game to comeout. The frist one ROCKED. This one should be better, Iys better than all the other DBZ games. This is a must for any DBZ fan's christmas list. Take it from me. I', a true fan. And Im a girl"
4,Its not that good guys (sigh)--- Gorby Shih,"When I got it I was overjoyed because it looked cool, but when you finish Dragon mode(like story mode) its not that fun any it becomes boring and not intresting. Its really easy and easy playing so it only lasts for 2-5 days. Parents if you child tells you to buy this don't. Also the 3-d animation is two thumbs down.P.s Tip: Do training first if you bought, or else you won't understand it."
5,Childhood memories,I loved this cookbook when my mom gave it too me and we spent time together making and messing up stuff! It is something all families need to do and I had to buy it because it has so many memories to me and it was left behind.
2,are we talking about the same CD?,"this cd blows...why does everyone think it's so good? i really like R. Kelly and i think he's really talented. everyone told me not to waste my money on it but i did anyway, and kicked myself for throwing $15 down the drain. there's only maybe, like 3 good songs on it (including ignition, which is way overplayed as it is) and the rest is crap. this cd sucks...don't waste your money. at the very least give it a listen to make sure you dig it."
5,"R.Kelly ""Chocolate Factory"" truly AMAZING!!","R.Kelly's new album ""Chocolate Factory"" is an extraordinary piece of work. I have been a huge fan of his music since through his early projects in the 90's. Even though, he is going through alot of trials and tribulations, he maintains to keep his head up and bless us with good music. Songs that truly stand out on this album are ""HEART OF A WOMAN"",""DREAM GIRL"", STEP IN THE NAME OF LOVE(REMIX AS WELL AS THE REGULAR VERSION), IGNITION(REMIX AS WELL AS THE REGULAR VERSION),SHOWDOWN w/ MR.Biggs, I'LL NEVER LEAVE. Lets just say the ENTIRE ALBUM stands out. This album is great and If you are a fan of R.KELLY's music, this is a collector's item!! R.Kelly, keep blessing us with good music like in the CHOCOLATE FACTORY, the type of music that makes us feel good. You are in my prayers. KEEP YOUR HEAD UP. May GOD continue to bless you!"
1,Disturbing person... character does matter,This guy urinates on underage girls and films it! For god sake! Don't give him your money. The creepiest guy since Woody Allen.
1,SICKO,only good songs areIgnition (Remix)SnakeStep In The Name Of Love (Remix)been around the world would be good but it has the worst rapper of all time (ja rule) on itso its terriblehes a sicko all the other songs are badddddddddddddddddd
1,Come on people...,"I rape children...so support me by buying this album...you should ALL be ashamed...especially if you call yourselves ""Christian""...but then again I'll be astonished if ANY of Amazon's ""FILTER PEOPLE"" have enough moral BACKBONE to post this...The music is as sickening as the LITTLE BOY."
5,The Best Cd ever,Regardless of his past troubles R. Kelly never dissapoints. This is the best cd to date that R.Kelly has done. You start with Chocolate Factory and end with Apologies of a Thug. Not to mention ending the final chapter between him and Mr. Bigs on Showdown. I only wish that he put more songs from the Loveland cd on here. R.Kelly knows how to keep the fans wanting more.
5,The Boy Has Done It Again..........,"OH MY GOD,EVERYTIME SOMEONE TRIES TO BRING HIM DOWN, HE'S NOT HAVING IT. ALL I CAN SAY IS THE BOY HAS DONE IT AGAIN. WONDERFUL MUCH LOVE TO R.KELLY. KEEP YOUR HEAD UP AND REMEMBER YOUR MOTHER IS VERY PROUD OF U............GOD BLESS"
3,its okey,"i enjoyed R.kelly in album like R. where u have ""half on a babyget up on a room , when a woman is fed up and others like thati enjoyed R.kelly in tp2.com tracks like : i decided , one me,i wish, u dont say no, just like that, all i really want, feasta etc.chocolate factory is okey for me with few tracks like :heart of a woman, been around the world, imaging that, chocolate factory.but still kelly should wake up to his R&B; style. the cool style he used in tp2.com and RKelly is my R&B; top artist. but still i sujest he improve his instrumentals(beat) He has good lyrics buts still needs good beat(instrumental). Kelly u are still my modelthe pied piper R&B;."
4,Another Good Disc,"This is another great album from R. Kelly. The first four songs on the disc are much weeker than the rest of this disc, but they are definately more than tolerable before you get to the good stuff. The album definately picks up with the poppy ""Dream Girl"" which leads right into the two best songs on the disc ""Ignition"" and ""Iginition Remix"". As a continuam of ""Contagious,"" ""Showdown"" is very entertaining (love the wild west whistle done with the gutair!). The last two songs provide a fun end to yet another great R. Kelly disc. I am sure that you'll catch yourself dancing your way down the road while listening to this album. I know that I did!!"
4,Very Good R Kelly ALbum,"R Kelly is the best singer/songwriter of our time, hands down. First of all I want to say that personally I don't care what R Kelly does or doesn't do in his personal time. R Kelly's fans have stuck with him through the hard times and I am one of those fans. Anyways, Chocolate Factory was a very good album, one of my favorites.I believe TP2.com was alot better but nevertheless, this album is still sick. I liked his singles alot which were, Ignition Remix and Snake. I believe that Step In the name of Love remix was the single for ""The R in R&B;"" but that song is still hot. This album is good from start to finish which is rare now a days in the music industry. My favorite songs would have to be the singles mentioned above and Ignition, Step In the Name of love, Showdown, and Who That, just to mention a few. For R&B; fans out there, I suggest you add this and every other R Kelly album to your collect. Go Get This Album NOW!!!"
2,Too much verbose,It's not technical book. There is not any explanation about the mp3 format. Too much verbose.
1,ABSOLUTE JUNK!,I took it out of the package and tried the lock a couple time and then all of a sudden it would no longer spin when locked like it's supposed to. Please avoid this item!
4,Does what its supposed to do....,I got this for my 06 Tundra and its brought me some peace of mind since the fuel door doesn't lock. Cap is easy to use and has a quality feel. Be sure to turn it backwards after you tighten it to make sure it spins freely... sometimes it will not fully lock an you can just twist it off. Some have reported a check engine light with this and it goes away after putting the stock cap back on so don't throw it away just in case. I have not had this problem yet after about a month. Would buy again!
5,One of Eastwood's best Westerns.,"To me, this is one of Clint Eastwood's best westerns he made. There was a $5000 reward on his head. ""A man's got to do something for a living"", said one bounty hunter. ""Dying ain't much of a living"", replied Josey. (If the film had a message, that was it)."
5,The Outlaw Josey Wales,"One of Eastwood's finest and most underrated directorial efforts, ""Outlaw"" leaves behind the actor's Man With No Name persona for a slightly more honorable, if no less laconic, hero out for vengeance. Though he's a wanted renegade with an agenda, Wales befriends a wry Cherokee, Lone Watie (George), and two settlers, old-timer Paula Trueman and sultry Sondra Locke. Cheated of his own family, Wales forms--and then must defend--a make-shift community where trust and respect are the founding pillars. Great acting, exquisite photography, and an engaging story about alliances make for a rousing, thoughtful Western. Open your door for this Outlaw."
3,For my husband,I didn't purchase this movie for myself but my husband really likes it. It hasn't been opened yet so I hope the recording is good.
5,Clint E can do no wrong.,One of my favorite westerns so I knew I would love it. You can't go to wrong with Clint Eastwood.
3,Solid effort here and a bit different. Really Three-and-a-half stars but amazon doesn't allow half stars,"Sort of a western in that Eastwood playssympathetic ex-Confederate soldier who'swife and son get murdered by Yanks AFTERthe war was supposed to be over! Yankeefanatic, long time Eastwood complitistBill McKinney (Pink Cadillac/Thunderboltand Lightfoot, et, al)plays sadistic sol-dies who just can't get it through hishead that the war is over. Finally Walesruns him through with a sword to provehis point. John Vernon (another Hawai'iFive-0 vet) has good role, as does ChiefDan George in one of his last roles."
4,Clint's Western ode to Racial harmoneee,"I used to watch this religiously as a kid, just like I did with alll the re-runs like Indy Jones/Superman, and all the usual biggies of the earache...watching it last night on T.V., apart from the adverts every five minites, I realized strains of Care in the Community from our beloved gunslinger!Choc fulla Western Cliches, but, then again, he started the whole thing, and nobody does it better than Clint with a squint in his eye.They 'Howdy' scenes with the Cheif are great, too.More than just a gunfest."
3,Nothing New. Very Ordinary.,"Viewed: 3/06Rate: 53/06: The Outlaw Josey Wales is a fair Western picture directed by Clint Eastwood but is rather mundane and trifle. It feels like that if I've seen one, I've seen it all. The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is too far superior to The Outlaw Josey Wales. This film is just filled with too many cliches and some slightly bad acting. The plot wasn't all that wonderful and interesting. I just wished Clint Eastwood could have used the style from Sudden Impact and A Fistful of Dollars and incorporated them into a Western film starring himself, but I don't think it had happened at all. Unforgiven is literally a different kind of a film and far off the scope. What I meant to say is I want to see Western Dirty Harry in a bit better picture than Pale Rider. All in all, The Outlaw Josey Wales is a bit unique...all right but not good enough; it felt like I kept waiting for something to happen, and it never did."
3,Text like a B rate movie script,"If you like the slow pace of a college class and script like a B rate movie, you may like this book. Professor Smiley does get the message across in an understandable fashion, but you must be prepared to read this book as a transcript from a class, not as an instruction manual, and thus put up with lots and lots of extra dialog. If you are not a beginner programmer, and I don't just mean VB programmer, then you should first try traditional books where you get vastly more information in the same number of pages. If you have difficulty learning outside of a classroom, then the Learn To Program books may be for you."
5,an eastern western,"the label program of c.r.i. recommends the finest chinese modern classical music ... some notes here for the chinese are outstanding avantgarde. leaving all traditions ... for us these music is under another level common cultural ground, composers like zorn and others in the avantgarde are marked influenced ... here you can hear the difference ... this music is more concentraded, more worked out and so much more floating than the music of those who tried to get into from the western side ... to the chinese this music here is western music"
1,"crashes the computer, destroys the disk","I've had one of these things since February '03 and have burned only 7 or 8 CDs. It now crashes, freezing up my machine. Only a complete, pull-the-plug-out-of-the-wall reboot will get me up again. After a long (20 minutes!) disk restoration, the recovery fails and the CD is permanently unusable. I've tried this several times.The software, by Roxio, is incredibly annoying. They clearly have no interest in existing user interface research.About me: I have a degree in computer sci. from UC Berkeley, have worked in the software biz for 20 years, and am not intimidated by hardware."
3,Not completely unbiased,"They don't make movies like this anymore - the closest mainstream one lately might have been 'The 6th Sense' - only because its in the same genre. Moreover, since the director went to my high school in Rochester, NY, he gave all the students (including myself) dibs on the small extra parts. So, unless you are from western NY, odds are you probably won't enjoy this film.Its a thiller, not terribly scary - and not terribly accurate in its dipiction of 'The White lady' (Basically, the legend is nothing more than a Rochesterian version of Lizzie Borden). However, for nostalgia purposes, most of the movie was indeed filmed in upstate, NY (which really is the only beautiful time of year), thus, the cinematography is magnificent, if only to save the flawed plot and expected ending.NOTE: If you happen to catch a young version of Zach Braff (the guy from 'Scrubs') don't blink - it's only me."
2,Does not sound like classical guitar,"This sounds like it was played using a pick, or using thumb and index finger. The notes seem disconnected and not very smooth. The two last peices (Recurerdos... and Malaguena) sound good enough though. As I listened to this, I could not help but wonder how it was recorded (is almost sounds like duets on some peices). I wish I knew who recorded this."
1,AARGH!!,I can't believe how bad this is - the guitar in question isn't even in tune..incredibly tinny sounding. All I can think is this is some student recording. Only their parents would feel proud. Just remember the old addage - you get what you pay for - buy something else!!!
1,Big Problem,"The item looks lovely but the first one to arrive was smashed and unusable, the replacement had two broken nectar holders (the hanger part smashed) so unusable. I have cancelled any further replacements."
2,I do not care for it,"It does not smell like the Cashmere at Macy's. But, kept it just to use for everyday until it runs out."
2,CASHMERE MIST by Donna Karan EDT SPRAY 3.4 OZ for WOMEN,"After being impressed by a ""sniffer"" in a newspaper supplement, shopped online. Found this, appeared to be the best deal. Disappointed because I didn't notice that it's toilet water, not perfume. Oh well, it's only seventy bucks. Also, the ""sniffer"" smelled better."
2,At first glance,"At first glance product catches the eye with price. With 4 SATA connectors its ideal for most and mainly reliable til, ur system keeps shutting off and u have no idea y. I purchased about 5 different wattages of this product and all ended with same result, somehow and for some unforeseen reason the fan on PS had lost its blades causing it to overheat, hence the unexpected shutdowns. I keep my system stationary so I have no clue as to how or y the blades broke and the fan dislodged itself but hey, u get what u pay for right. Its cheap, and in my opinion still a good choice for temporary replacement but not good for long-term use. The last 1 barely lasted over a month and here I am replacing the replacement...lol"
1,Piece of junk,Installed power supply and it worked for two weeks. Then it would turn on and turn off repeatedly. No response from company for supposed 3 year warranty.
1,buyer beware!!!,Beware it will catch on fire! It has no over current protection and it will fry your motherboard. if there was a negative rating I will give -5 stars
3,"Good Power, Sounds like a jet",This is a good supply with plenty of connectors and power for a low end system.It is much too loud. This will be the loudest thing in the room. Buy something else.
3,Not What I Expected,"This is nice little book, but it is not at all what the description led me to believe it was and it is certainly not worth the cost. This is not a true guidebook at all. Rather, it is a very brief (only 128 pages total, with wide margins on all 4 sides of the page) account of the Hostrop's personal travel experiences with little tidbits of advice tossed in.I have visited Australia twice and am planning a third trip, which is why I purchased this book. It will not be of use to me in planning my next trip, nor do I believe it would have been especially useful in planning my previous trips, even though my last trip was made in part in a campervan.I also found the repeated urgings to make use of Newmans (a travel agency) a bit disconcerting. Was the Hostrops' trip underwritten by Newmans?My advice: spend your money on the Frommer's and Lonely Planet guides. They will be much more useful."
5,What an EXCELLENT tool!!!,"Having used everything from brute strength to two pairs of dykes to handle problems with instalation of the parking brake cable, it is really nice to finally see a tool designed for this work!!!"
3,Resistance is...err....Exterminate! Exterminaaaaaaaaaaaate!!,"Lotsa Whovians were quick to put down Peel's Dalek book. And if you're a continuity (Doctor Who continuity? Bwah-ha-ha!!!) freak who gets a few pounds from the Terry Nation Estate, why wouldn't you?Yes, they messed up with the White Daleks, and the Brown Daleks, and Great Maw forgive Peel for how he misrepresented the post-Movellan Fuschia & Tutti Frutti Daleks!What I'm getting at is this: This book presented new Daleks in refreshingly inventive configurations; not just the regular salt and pepper shaker variety we've loved for decades....What gargantuan yarbles this Peel has!'War of...' was a delightful read. Unfortunately, his follow up ""Legacy of the Daleks"" isn't fit to wipe...well you know (kids love Amazon.com but crikey!)"
1,Christina Aguilera What A Girl Wants Review,"This song IS THE WORST SONG ON EARTH!!!! It's cool at the begging where it says ""What a girl wants, what a girl needs"" although then it goes through this disgusting acoustic guitar solo and it totally ruins the feel of the song! All of her other songs rock except for this one and everybody makes such a big deal out of this one! This should not be on any album, tour, shirt nothing! Come on Christina, you can do better!!"
3,"""Teeny-boppy"" but a fun light-hearted Summertime song.","This song conjures up sunny days in June when high shcool is about to let out for the summer and the spirit of hanging out at the beach or socializing with friends is in the air. Again this song has pretty good lyrics and sexy vocals like Genie, but I hope Aguilera focuses on her vocal and songwritting abilities as she grows with her fans. One annoyance that seems to be present on her cd is her whispering in the background of her songs. It sounds like she is talking on the phone. This can get a bit irritating rather quickly. To me it sounds inmature and ""teeny-boppy"", and I don't think teenagers should be written off as unserious and irresponsible."
1,text tracker,"I attempt to read up to 4 business books per month. I was excited about the title and the hype surrounding this book. Like so many internet marketing hype stories this was more air than substance. It met no real desire of mine to assist people to find their purpose, understand better their potential or really give them the power to achieve great things. I am sure it met the author's desire in increasing potential sales, increasing the possibility of selling to a larger audience and in achieving their required objective. If this is the end then success as defined by this measure was I am sure achieved. If it was to give the reader an exciting read, a process for achieving great results, then I feel it failed miserably. It got to the point that half way through the book I stopped reading and moved onto the next book"
5,Dark and deadly the necro's are revealed,Evil personified.. These guys have made a habit of making nightmares come true. I really found this book disturbing but also enlightening. You want evil then read this book. Not only is the secrets of this Family revealed but what it has planed for all of Humanity as well. How often can you use another race of super naturals to do your bidding but you can use the full force of Vampires as well. A great read in very informative. All you ever wanted to know and more....
5,Excellent range of material covered,"Tony has done a great job simplifying complex tools to enhance communication. ""Communicating at Work"" is the type of book that you buy extra copies to give to people you know. It will also become a resource for ongoing reference as you sharpen your skills. Great Job Tony!"
4,JIM'S REVIEW,"Communicating at Work was a well written, easy to read, and easy to understand book. Authors Tony Alessandra and Phil Hunsaker give a lot of useful information that an employee at level of an organization would find useful and helpful. There is a lot of information in this book that I found will be key to my sucessful employment. I would recommend employers utilize this book as a tool to the development of their employees and business. The only flaw I believe with this book is that it was written in 1993 so some of the material and example seem to be a little dated."
1,Very poor printing quality,"The content of the book is great and I have no complaints. The coverage of instrumental analysis techniques is quite complete, although some procedures such as Mossbauer spectroscopy and instrumental neutron activation analysis are not discussed. My problem is that I paid for a new book and was sent an inferior ""Low Cost Edition"" that was printed in India and expressly for sale only in Asia - I live in the U.S. The book was also used and had the previous owner's name whited out in the inside front cover. An illegal, low cost used book is not what I ordered."
5,I won't buy any other brand!,"I love this heater so much that when I need space heating it is the only brand I will even consider. As of this date, I have purchased eight of them and that meets all of my heating needs for my small house. In fact, this heater works so well I don't need to use the gas fireplace or any central system. I can't speak for colder climates, of course, but for Southern CA it's effective on the coldest, windiest days. And I've had only one fail and that one was ancient, at least six years of use. The price is right too!"
1,stretch belt,"I ordered a 36"" belt. In order to get it to work, I gotta stretch it so much it almost hurts. If you order this belt, add on at LEAST 6"". I think the reason it is on sale is because the size is WRONG"
3,New at Wedding Photography,"I'm just starting out in wedding photography and I was taken to a wedding with another photographer to learn the ropes. There was alot of good info in this book, but it seems to be overkill in some areas. I've talked to other wedding photographers and none of them take a whole set of studio lights with them. The author seems to be doing a lot of elite weddings that I will probably never do."
5,":""Artrage"" is delightful and thought-provoking.","I opened ""Artrage"" and very soon found myself hooked. Here's a combined realistic portrait, caricature, and merry send-up of the whole current Manhattan culture mix. I kept seeing one icon after another, most with pie in their faces or on their behinds,, but also a number of individuals ---- Mace, Margo, Nick (especially) ---- who are sympathetically drawn and who, at times, touch the heart. That's quite a feat, and it provides some fine hours and good lingering thoughts to ponder."
3,Reviewer of the Stars,"This is one pompous interview book, but I have to admit, one of the best ones out there. Skee's always shoving it in our faces how he's the ""best friend"" to these guys, and how he's on the inside, taking the guys into the hot tub and meeting them at bath houses....why doesn't he tell us about having sex with these guys too? it seems like he does. Anyway, it's a good transcript book, as long as you can get through Mickey Skee's incredible ""I was there and you weren't"" attitude. He's cute, look at the photo in the book! I wonder what HIS dimensions are? I'm asking, do tell!"
4,Entertaining and candid,"""The interviews are . Skee doesn't patronize his subjects, and he's willing to ask hard questions about, among other things, their off-screen sexuality."" - Onan the Vulgarian, XXX Factor (Phoenix)"
1,Disappointed,"A friend of mine introduced me to this CD a few months ago. I played it for a week, listening hard to see if I could understand what anyone's attraction might be to the whiny, unpolished lead voice or the semi-suggestive, unremarkably puerile lyrics. I finally decided that the title was accurate and the name of the band was at the heart of this group's problem. Apparently, just a lot of cross talk by some uninteresting random dudes."
5,A Fine Book on the Universal Nature of Mysticism,"Harvey's book on mysticism is highly engaging discussion of the wonders of Divine Presence in the lives of numerous people from greatly varying religious traditions.While this book was a fascinating read for me, I think that the most important lesson I take home from the book is the wonderful fact of how the Divine is present in all great religions -- to some degree or other. This sort of thinking helps one to refrain from prejudice toward those of different religious persuasions, and it can induce a strong sense of appreciation for how God can show up in the lives of human individuals all over the world, in all countries, all cultures, and all great religions.I would recommend this book for anyone interested in reading of the mystical journeys of highly spiritual and (oftentimes) highly intelligent people of all human eras and all parts of the world."
5,Buy This Book!,"This is the most incredible novel I have ever written. It has fascinating characters, fast action, and the gals end up saving their whimpy boyfriends. In addition, there is multi-layered symbolism for all those English majors out there.Buy it, and have a ball!"
2,Disappointing,"YoYo Ma is one of the commercialised ""superstars"" in Isaac Stern's stable, with a slick style designed to cater for mass audiences. He still doesn't convince me that there are real feelings behind his music. Baroque suits his style of playing well and the CD won't disappoint the fans. But the title tells all - a second bite at a succesful commercial cherry. Will the series stretch as long as Police Academy?"
5,So good you can taste it,"I was in awe the first time I played this CD. I felt as though I could feel the music in my mouth and sensed it through my nose. It was pure loveliness. Yoyo Ma is definately a master at his craft. Although I have been a long time classical music lover, this was my first classical CD purchase. There was no way I could leave the store with out buying it. It is hypnotic and I was truly moved by his authentic arrangements of his selected Baroque pieces. He even has his precious cello altered to authenticize the traditional Baroque sound of that period. A must have for ALL music lovers."
4,Extremely enjoyable listening,The first track on this CD is simply one of the most sublime pieces of music ever written or recorded.
5,Just Guessing.,"I suspect that this CD is wonderful. However, Amazon had to sub this order out to CD NOW which is more aptly named CD NEVER. I am and experienced internet shopper and I understand that mistakes happen, shipments get lost, and shipments can be stolen. But, that is what email is for-- tracking lost shipments. I emailed CD NEVER and received no response, so now I call them CD NEVER MIND.Amazon has listened to my pleas and refunded the cost of this cd to my account. I then purchased it on line from Tower Records."
4,October Sky,"I really liked the soundtrack as well as the movie. I liked the Coalwood song because when I was listening to the song , it made me relize what the coal miners in my family go through everyday. I thought it was a very good soundtrack and the music really fits in with my home state West Virginia."
4,"Listen to samples, read reviews.","Of all places, my exercise instructor would play a slightly haunting, lovely melody during cooldown at class. Asked what it was and she said Oct Sky soundtrack. Huh, really? When she said it was one of most expensive cd's/soundtracks she'd bought I was more intrigued. Did the search; wow, yea, pricey. Really like it, acknowledging that like many soundtracks it has a wider range of sounds/song types than non soundtrack cd might. But the tunes I love make the whole quite worthwhile. I remember really enjoying the movie and never seperated the music out.Recommend"
2,Poor Quality And Packaging,Besides having the parts come in damaged twice when my mechanic installed the exhaust the hangers and supports had to be reworked witch cost another hour in labor.Also the tail pipes do not line up evenly because the pipes were not bent correctly.If i had to do it over again i would have just gone to a muffler shop and had a custom exhaust made.I will just have to live with this very expensive exhaust system because it is now installed in my truck.What a BUMMER!
2,Come Drink With Me,"I disagree with most of the reviews. I did not enjoy this film and I am a kung fu fanatic. At the end of the movie I found myself asking....is that it? How can this movie be classified as one of the greatest kung fu movies ever and inspired Crouching Tiger???? The fighting and acting was so-so. The wire work? What wire work? If you want to see a good kung fu movie see: The Victom, Drunken Master, Iron Monkey, Fist Of White Lotus, Enter The Dragon, Tai Chi Warriar, The Invincible Armor, Snake In The Monkeys Shadow, Jet Li Legend, Fearless Hyena, Drunken Master 2, Thundering Mantis, So Close, Chocolate, Hero, Ong Bak 1 & 2, The Protector, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, House of Flying Daggers, Azumi and a large number of Jet Li or Jackie Chan movies. These movies will give you you moneys worth of excellent fight scenes, action and entertainment. Don't waste your money on a drink."
5,18 Once Again,This is a very good movie. I saw it in the theater and have since gotten it on video and later DVD. Its a very good and funny movie to watch. You should get it.
5,18 Again,The movie is great...Schlatter does a GREAT George Burns..he's the only reason I wanted this movie! Arrived in great shape.
3,The Cat Who Walked Across France,"The story ""The Cat Who Walked Across France"" written by Kate Banks is a good story. It is about a cat that lives happily by the sea with an elderly lady. The lady pats and rubs the cat. When the woman dies, the cat's life is completely changed. He is sent north with all her possessions, but he is uncared for. He hangs around the streets begging for food. He does not like the situation he is in, so he decides to go away. He travels across France looking for a place like his seashore home. He goes through troubles and difficulties, but still he is longing for somebody who will take care of him. After a long journey, he finds a stone house where is welcome, fed, patted and scratched gently with small hands. He feels being home at last .I think the paintings' of this book are stunning and lively. The way both the paintings and the map on the back cover display the cat's journey across France, it draws a great interest of the readers."
1,Total dissapointment,"I bought this bag for my big interview day. I thought that it looks professional and would be what I was looking for. Unfortunately, this bag is a huge disappointment! Its to sturdy, uncomfortable to wear, heavy even when empty and the SMELL is awful! It smells like plastic and no matter what I do I can't get rid of the smell! I thought smell would subside by time, but NO! I feel it all around me when I am wearing this bag! I wore it only at one of my interviews and felt embarrassed by the smell I was leaving behind. I am so disappointed! I would not recommend this bag to anyone!"
1,Nice briefcase...horrible customer service!,"The briefcase was nice but it did not have a strap for attaching to an upright suitcase so I returned it. I received a rude e-mail from their customer service demanding to know why I returned the product...even though I had already stated my reasons thorugh Amazon's refund page - to which they never bother to respond. Furthermore, the refund took a month to process! I will NEVER purchase from this company again. Be absolutely certain you want what you order from these people so you don't have to deal with them in person."
2,Holden projects serious level of disinterest.,"Holden mailed in this performance. Just because he was capable of doing movies with Asian co-star doesnt mean the screenplay is automatically high caliber. And whoever imagined the part for the lovely France Nyuen must have had a stereotyped image of how Chinese ladies behave in such a situation. I agree this was done in the 1950's when Holden was still doing pictures with Jennifer Jones playing a half-cast Chinese doctor in Love Is A Many Splendored Thing, but Nyuen simply says nothing with an empty smile on her face the whole picture. The studio set backdrops no more look like the real China than does my hometown. All the other Chinese actors try valiantly to overcome the stiff direction with various degrees of success."
1,"Poor acting, characters and plot","This is the politically correct version of Robin Hood, complete with a feminist Maid Marian, superstitious and ignorant Friar Tuck, and a Moor, in the role of the true hero. The character of Robin Hood is irrelevant, and annoying, as portrayed by Kevin Costner, who only does well in baseball movies. In any event, there were no Moors in medieval England, and the character of Friar Tuck has been changed to represent Hollywood's contempt for Christians. There were other historical inaccuracies- the Moor brings gunpowder to England almost 200 years before gunpowder was invented...But then, movies like this are only interested in politically correct multiculturlaism- not the truth."
3,"Great film, poor DVD quality","I loved this film when it first came out, and bought it recently when I saw it out on DVD. Unfortunately the production quality was terrible. Picture was grainy, colors seemed out of sync at times, and there were skips and artifacts at several places. The CD is two sided, unclear why. I tried several other DVDs to make sure it wasnt the player. I'd recommend this film to anyone - on VHS."
2,Great movie...weird format,"The most notable thing about this product isn't the movie or special features, but the arrangement of items on the disk. It's a two -sided DVD, which is fine. But what's weird is, instead of putting the movie on one side and the special features on the other, they put the special features on side one with half of the movie. The movie actually stops half way through and instructs you to flip it over so you can finish watching it!! This is definitely a major downside. It's a great movie, so if you haven't seen it yet, I would strongly suggest watching it at some point. But if you're planning on buying it, you might want to wait until a different DVD version comes out, so that you can avoid having to get up in the middle of your movie to flip it over."
3,Beware! Odd Editions In Existence. . . .,"I don't have a great deal to say that hasn't been said dozens of times already. My main point of this review is to warn about the DVD itself. The version that I purchased is extremely odd in the fact that the entire film ISN'T on one side of the DVD. Halfway through the movie you are forced to turn the disc over to see the rest of the film. I'm not sure why this was done, the movie isn't THAT long, and I would think that the entire thing should have fit on one side. Of course, the problem could just be that perhaps the copy that I received just happened to be an old one that was created in the early days of DVD. In any case, just be careful when purchasing this one."
2,Two sided disc,First off....I love this movie! It may not be the best Robin Hood but it is entertaining! That being said...This SPECIAL version SUCKS! About half way through the movie stopped....Just Stopped. Lucky another reviewer left a comment about the other half of the movie being on the other side of the disc. Why they did that? No clue....Is it a pain? YES! I wish that I would have bought a different version with better picture quality. I guess I will have to do that when they come out with the next big thing and DVD's are obsolete!
2,Incomplete movie,"I was looking forward to watching this fun movie, but the dvd stopped entirely, half way through. The scene selection ended at 17, it just went black. I don't know if there was supposed to be another disc or what? It was roughly halfway through so I'm not sure if something happened in making the DVD. Disappointing to say the least."
1,Warner Brothers Lied,"The DVD case claims the DVD is dual layer format but I still had to flip the DVD to see the rest of the movie. No warning on screen to flip the DVD, nothing. It took me awhile to figure out I had to flip the disk over when the picture suddenly ended. Warner Brothers should be ashamed of themselves for putting out such a poor quality product, let alone misrepresenting it. Do not buy this piece of junk!"
1,Don't waste your money on this third-rate version!,"There is only one version of the Robin Hood story worth looking at, and that is Robin of Sherwood. Better acted, better scripted, better filmed, better researched and a thousand times more entertaining.And given how much the Costner debacle has ""borrowed"" from it, they obviously thought so too"
3,flipper,"Unfortunately, this version is on a 'flipper' disc. Part of its on side one, the other part on side two. Most collectors, like me, despise this format. There is no way to know that you are getting a flipper disc, because the info doesnt tell you, and the sellers wont either. Im going to get the 2 disc special edition version of this movie, and trust I will be satisfied with that."
2,"Movie is good, format is not","I really like this movie but was extremely disappointed when I watched it and realized that you had to turn the DVD over half way through the movie. I thought that buying a DVD would take away the hassles of two VHS tapes that longer movies have. Also, I have another DVD that is only five minutes shorter and you do not have to turn it over. I was very disappointed at this and would not have bought the DVD if I had known."
3,Not true blu ray quality,"Bought this as a gift for my mother, she is a big Kevin Costner fan and a fan of this movie. I watched it with her on the Blu-Ray player I had gotten her for Christmas. I was disappointed at the picture quality of the movie. I even double checked the back of the case to see if it really was 1080p. It claims to be but doesn’t appear to be any better than a standard DVD. The movie is good and claims to be an extended edition, but if there is additional footage it must not be anything special as I didn’t catch any differences."
5,The Oh So Sexy and Oh So Fascinating Sherriff of Nottingham,"Forget Kevin Costner. He is a no-show in the talent olympics. Alan Rickmanstole this movie. His Sherriff was sexy, devious, insanely fun and just about the only reason to buy this film. Get the extended version. Everything that was cut from the original was Rickman at his most sexy.This is an absolute must for Rickman fans. Especially the ladies who find him irresistable."
3,GOOD BLU RAY TRANSFER,"An excellent movie, it has all the ingredients a blockbuster film should have and holds up well to date. I am sure a better job could have been done restoring the movie but overall there was no grain in the print. Costner owns this movie in every sense. I don't really need the Brit accent to be sold on Robin Hood film as long as it captures the spirit of the story. You hardly see fun blockbusters like this anymore. The film also holds some fond memories for me so that works as a bonus. It has good making of features one which includes Pierce Brosnan. While I certainly love Ridley Scott's version of Robin Hood it really didn't have a fun/rouge like feeling."
1,Robin Hood; Prince of Thieves,I bought this movie with high hopes. This movie was a disappointment. The picture is terrible. It not only looks old; its old. the picture looks like it came from 1973; I don't know when color TV came out; but this picture is a joke. Don't buy this movie; its a waste of your hard earned money.
3,"Entertaining, but ...","I am a Kevin Costner fan - the man is just talented and ever so pleasant on the eyes. I enjoyed the movie and the humour, and twists and turns. However, this is supposed to be a show that children (older ones) will look at. I did not think it was necessary to make the witch so grotesque, neither was it necessary to have the sheriff hold down Lady Marion the way it was portrayed. Apart from that, it was a good adaption."
3,RUSHED TO DVD AND NOT VERY GOOD,"Unfortunatly, Warner Bros. continues to rush pre-dvd era movies to dvd and they do it very cheaply. I saw this movie at the theatre and later bought the vhs. When I got the dvd, I was upset to learn that warner bros. did the same to this great film as in some others of the pre-dvd era. This dvd comes in a cheap case that is not all that durable and this dvd is two sided meaning the viewing is spoiled because you have to eject the dvd turn it over in the tray to see the second half. The movie is good and would have been 4 or 5 stars easily if not for the way Warner Bros. hurries to release their catalogue on dvd format.Also, by having to play both sides of the dvd you will need to clean your player more and the dvd itself will not last as long. I do not recomend this or any other release that WB. does. Until they get with the program, wait until a special edition of the movie is released."
2,2 words for Mr. Costner - Dialect Coach,"This film is only saved by the performances of Morgan Freeman and Alan Rickman. Micheal McShane is good as Friar Tuck, but underused. One thing that folks around here have neglected to mention is that Costner starts out the film with a light British accent, which he loses about 5 minutes into the film. Costner probably refused to have a dialect coach. Robin Hood is an English character, and it might have done Costner some good to actually challenge himself for a change.In my opinion, Errol Flynn is still the definitive film Robin Hood. Also, the British series 'Robin of Sherwood' is a marvellous version of the Robin Hood story, with much better acting than in this film."
1,It's a Flipper!,My reveiw is not about the movie itself. The DVD is a flipper. After watching the movie most of the way through it you have to get up and flip the disk over to see the rest of the movie. dont waste your money on this one until they re-release it dual layered.
2,"Robin Hood, Prince of Dweebs","...was our name for this movie when it first came out, and it fits. Maid Marian is Ninja Woman the first time we see her, but in the attempted rape scene, all she can do is scream ""Robin, Robin!"" and throw a candle at the Sheriff. Historical inaccuracies abound. Ditto all that has been said (all true) about Costner's accent. Stick to The Adventures of Robin Hood (Flynn in tights still comes off as far more masculine than Costner every thought of being), or the Disney Version (it has a few fun songs by Roger Miller instead of that abrasive Bryan Adams tune. Beautiful production, lousy script). And why did they have to add a Ceasearean, Celts, and Robin's illegitimate brother? They didn't think the script was convoluted enough? Brightest moment: Sean Connery's return from captivity. Too bad they didn't rescue Richard a little earlier; maybe he could have saved this film."
2,Robin Hood?!?,"It is a tragedy that kids today know more about ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" than Robin Hood. I am of the opinion that kids need to get back to these classic heroes. But not by watching this lousy movie. Go get the Howard Pyle or Roger Lancelyn Green retelling of the story. Or better still, read the original songs and poetry about the Merry Men of Sherwood. Or read some ""Green Arrow"" comics. Anything is better than this tired movie. I fell asleep several times rewatching this movie recently - and believe me, I really TRIED to like it - having been in a ""Robin Hood"" fever and all.Mix in Kevin Costner's half-hearted, tired performance and American accent with Morgan Freeman's unnecessary Muslim advisor to the Merry Men(?!?) and Alan Rickman's cynical portrayal of the Sheriff and you get a movie that you wish was never made in the first place. And did I mention that Bryan Adams' themesong? On second thought, I'd better not..."
1,Not what I expected.,"Haven't had a chance to watch the movie yet, but was very disappointed when I received it to open and find that the disc is front and back, making it necessary to stop the movie halfway through to turn the disc over. Definitely would not have purchased it if I had known this up-front."
1,"1 Star for the DVD, 3 Stars for the Movie",The movie is ok for what it is. Thursday night entertainment. You get one film format and the extras are the same on both sides of the disk. PLUS you MUST turn over the disk to VIEW the entire movie! If I had known that I would not have bought the DVD. I do not recommend the DVD. Do like a previous review suggested and buy it on VHS if you must have it.
3,arrrrghghghghhhhh,"This has got to be one of the worst DVDs (as DVD) in my collection. (The movie itself is fine.)To begin with, there are no special features. Or, rather, the ""special features"" listed consist essentially of ""interactive menus."" This is a special feature?Also, the makers of this DVD have seen fit -- God knows why since the movie isn't THAT long -- to put the movie on BOTH sides of the DVD, meaning that you have to get up and flip it over for part two. Since there isn't any extra footage or anything that would take up a lot of space, I'm baffled as to why they did this."
1,2-sided DVD,"I have never had a movie recorded on both sides of the DVD. You can imagine my dismay while watching the movie only to have it end half way through. My husband turned the DVD over and sure enough, the second half was on the other side of the DVD. If I would have know that I would never have purchased this DVD. Very disappointing."
1,The title is accurate.,"Prince of Thieves -- hmmm, they borrow the Muslim Merry Man from Robin of Sherwood, and some of the magic and plot details. And they borrowed from some other sources. Of course ""borrowing"" is a long-standing Hollywood tradition, and it would have been forgivable if Costner's Robin Hood had even an ounce of charisma, or if the dialogue wasn't wincingly bad (""Have I wronged you in a past life, Will Scarlet?"") or if the direction of the film had been even. Big spectacle with little or no brains behind it. I do like Little John (Nick Brimble) and his wife Fanny though. However, for a really good Robin Hood film of 1991, I recommend ""Robin Hood"" starring Patrick Bergin. And of course, you can always buy the Errol Flynn classic."
1,The picture quality was poor,The picture quality was poor. It looked like a copy that didn't take very well.
5,A brilliant if somewhat inaccurate take on Robin Hood.,"Although I never have had a concrete interpretation of the Robin Hood legend stories 1991's ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"" is without a doubt one of my childhood favorite movies and could very well be my favorite movie starring Kevin Costner."
3,Is Watchers 2 For You,"While I found Watchers 2 to be intriguing, it also seemed sort of incomplete in that it raised more questions than it answered and it did not appear to identify the scriptures it claimed were being fulfilled to the events that it shows are happening today. I wanted to know exactly which scriptures Dr. Marzulli believes are being fulfilled the sightings of UFOs, UFO like objects and Alien activities taking place. What does it all mean? Where is it going? You're left hanging! Bottom line, it is worth renting and I enjoyed it. But I would have been sorely disappointed had I bought it!"
3,A Solid Introduction To A Blues Artist Due For An American Breakthrough,"Deep Trout is a very good way to become familiar with this American blues artist, who like so many before him has had to go overseas to make himself known.Trout has been thrilling European audiences for over a decade with his excellent guitar playing, and this compilation CD features his great work on such cuts as ""Victor The Cajun,"" ""Kill The Monkey,"" and ""Fast Moving Traffic,"" but by far the premium cut on this record is ""If You Just Try,"" a live recording that just burns!Deep Trout serves as a great introduction to Walter Trout. Some of the cuts fall short of being great vocally and musically, but ""If You Just Try"" alone makes this CD worth buying."
2,Not worth the money,"I purchased the version with the different targeting areas. The concept is okay, but the product is simply too flimsy. The 'bag' has a molded plastic extension that sets down in to the base, and screws in to what is essentially a giant nut that sits under the base. VERY easy to assemble. When I first got it, I filled the base with water. The water wasn't heavy enough, and every time I kicked the bag at full power, the base would go scooting across the floor. Then I tried filling it with sand. The sand was heavier, which help the bag stay put. But then after 4 months of use (3-4 times a week), the plastic extension broke. Once it was broke and I was able to see how thin the plastic was, I was very disappointed.This product would probably be okay for beginners who have not yet developed any power to their kicks and punches, but it is simply not rugged enough for an advanced student."
2,"Only a 1-year limited warranty, Keep your receipt.","I could write a very detailed review, but there's plenty of those here. What I do want to touch on however, is the durability of the base (which holds the water).I've owned a wavemaster, and after a long hard summer of daily annihilation to it, the base finally started leaking water around the pressure area (the area that bends when you punch/kick it). It effectively rendered it quite useless since it's not something I could just ""patch up"" being in the area that is constantly bending and shifting when I hit the bag.This is why they only give a 1 year limited warranty. I had mine longer than that, so I knew my chances of getting any kind of assistance or replacement were just about zero. It's a bit sad though considering how much this costs. I'd buy another one if I felt I'd get more than a year out of it, but I'm not that confident.For someone that will only use this occasionally and / or hits very light, maybe it won't break as quickly."
2,Bag will break in time,"I purchased six of these for a boxing class. We only use the bags about one hour a week. Within the first year, three of the six bags broke. The bags ""screw"" into the base. The plastic part of the bag that screws in will snap and make the bag useless. The plastic used is simply not durable enough to hold up to strong punches. Being a procrastinator, I waited until after the warranty had expired to contact Century. They told me they were aware of the problem and could sell me a replacement part for $250 and $15 shipping. I purchased the bags for $249 each, so I didn't find this helpful at all. If the bags were more durable, I would purchase more, but until they fix the problem, I would not purchase another Wasemaster XXL."
2,"The item is ok, but I've got some issues","Well, the item is nice... But is it what i was supposed to get?First of all, the writing and such on the bag itself is not the same as the image shown with the WaveMaster written vertically on it... I got the one with the circular looking logo... Both say WaveMaster XXL but I don't know if there really is a difference so I haven't created an issue out of it. Yet.Secondly, the packaging was crappy... Granted it's huge and the bag part probably wouldn't need padding, the packaging leaves a lot to be desired. Suppose the base was punctured or something? There was no padding in that box either. See the link for the bag i actually got at CENTURY INC 20028463 Wavemaster XXL Black"
5,best movie ever,"Weekend at bernies is one of the funniest movies i remember watchin when i was a kid, i forgot all about it and was just searching comedies one day here on amazon and it popped up so i had to get it to add to my collection..all i got to say is GREAT MOVIE'"
1,made a mistake,"Duh! I thought I was ordering a DVD when in fact it was a VHS recording so I have no use for this...does anyone want a FREE VHS of ""weekend at bernie's""?"
5,"A FUNNY, FUNNY MOVIE!!!!","I laughed until my side almost split from pain. If you can't laugh at this movie, you are among the ranks of Bernie!!!!!"
5,Great Fun,This is a laugh out loud comedy about two idiots dragging around a corpse and getting deeper and deeper into trouble. One of the funniest movies ever written. The sequal Weekend at Bernies is almost as good.
3,Whimsical Weekend,"Two schlemiels arrive at a tropical island to murder their boss. Their plan is foiled because when they arrive they discover he has already been murdered by a rival faction. Believing they are being framed they create the perception that their boss is still alive. They showcase skills in the art of puppetry, determined to carry on the rest of their lives in this fashion."
2,Blues wizard,"I was able to listen to this because of Spotify.com, which is awesome, btw. I actually had to cobble it together, using several different albums, but I was able to listen to all four cds except for two songs. Anyway, I'm not a big blues fan to begin with, and after the fourth CD, I was able to figure out that a) women are no good; b) bad liquor is good for awhile, but in the end, stings; c) his life is a world of trouble. Apart from the limitations the genre and the era (1920s,30s etc) imposes on him, Lonnie Johnson is definitely an amazing guitar player. If you had to listen to just one CD, I'd go with number 4, which includes Big Leg Woman and I'm Guilty. It also has an early version of Careless Love, popularized by Madeline Peyroux."
2,The card stops working in 4 days.,"I purchased the card one month ago. First of all, the card received is different from the picture. It is thinner than the picture and doesn't have the write protector. Worst of all, my camera can not detect the card after 4 days use. I tried with another camera and two PDAs. None of them can detect the card. I contacted the ventor and requested a refund for the purchase. I finally got the refund but the shipping was deducted. I am not sure what the logic is here. Am I responsible for receiving the defective product? I won't bother to argue with them for the shipping charge but there is one thing for sure. I will never buy anything from SimpleTech again. I should give them one star rating but consider their promptness in replying email, I give them 2 stars rating."
4,Tired of manufactured music get Perch totally unique,"I had the privilege of interviewing Glen the lead singer in Philly for my show Journalist Viewpoint. I ultimately ended up becoming good friends with him. The album is totally unique and creative. Glen's voice is a cross between Jim Morrison and Anthony Kiedis of Chili Peppers.The lyrics all originally written. The guitar riffs are kickin. In a time of boy bands and manufacture music. This album steps above and rocks, very original. Whats up Glen"
5,I find this book to be very informative and helpful.,"I was very glad to find this book. It has help me in so many way about buying and selling of plates. I was surpise ot find out how much some of the plates I had purchased were worth. I recommend this book very highly, the graphics are clear and colorful."
2,(shrugging my shoulders),"It's alright, I still think they could do without ""Scolla"", ""scooter"", ""scholorship program"", whatever his name is. I like the original Dru Hill."
3,Not up to the usual Dru Hill standard,"It's an OK CD...the last two were way better. I am a huge Dru Hill fan, so believe me when I say you aren't missing much. The only good and decent tracks are ""I Should Be"" and ""Millions"", other than that it's OK."
2,Renee' Opinion,"I think that album is not the best of Dru Hill.I think they could have givin us a little more, but that's okay I know they will do better on the next album if there's is one"
5,DRU HILL IS BACK!!!,"I have waited for this album for the longest! I just love ""I Should Be""! I listened to the entire album on BET.com and it was off the chain. This is definitely at the top of my Christmas list. PLATINUM ALL THE WAY BABY!"
2,Fifth Wheel For What? (2- rating),"Fifth Wheel For What? (2- rating)I would love to know what is the new fifth member for? I did not hear any new voice ranges, or new style. As a matter a fact this is the worst Dru Hill CD I have ever heard. I was disappointed overall due to lack of anything being fresh. There was not one song that stood out like their previous singles like ""Tell Me"" or ""Beauty"". I did enjoy a few tracks like, ""If I Could"", ""No Doubt"", and ""Ole Love"". ""I Do (Millions)"", ""Never Stop Loving You"", and ""I Should Be"" were okay too, but there is nothing ""extraordinary"" about these tracks. As a fan of Dru Hill, and soloist Jazz, and Sisqo, I was completely displeased with this latest project and really hope that future ""Dru"" projects are a lot better than this. I don't regret buying this, however this purchase could have waited."
5,Dru Hill is back...finally!,"Like most Dru Hill fans, I have been waiting for this album for a long time. I am not disappointed either. I don't know what people are thinking when some say that this is not as good as the others. It is just as good if not the best one yet. They have the most harmonious voices I have ever heard. Scola was a good idea too!"
5,Dru Hill Is Wonderful,"Dru World Order is one of the best albums of the year 2002 and is the best album Dru Hill has made yet. The members of Dru Hill have really shown how much they've matured on this album, vocally and spirtually.After four long years off, Dru Hill has came back with a big BANG!"
3,Dru World Order,"I just bought this CD and got a chance to listen to the whole thing. It's not bad AT ALL. My favorite song is ""I Should Be,"" I love it! I gave the album three stars because I liked Enter the Dru better."
4,It's time for the new DRU WORLD ORDER!!!,"Dru hill is back!!! I got's to say that this cd is tha bomb!!! From extacy jones to the very last song it rocks. maybe one or two songs might not belong but other then that ohh wee.. Perfect to chill on a Sunday afternoon drinking some champange with you girl. Oh! and that song ""I should be"" is off the hook!! For all you Dru Hill fans u can't miss this CD and for those that are not well.... this CD might make u be one. I'm out my people's take care and much love aight.!!!"
2,Very inconsistent quality,"I purchased 4 bags of these almonds to make holiday gifts with. I candied them in a few different ways, but some of the nuts did not turn out well and I ended up throwing away 3-4lbs of the total batch because the almonds were really soft, even after roasting them longer than the non-soft almonds.Some of the almonds turned out great. However, at the price I was not happy about having to throw way an entire 4lb package of these because the quality was terrible. I shouldn't have to constantly sample almonds while preparing them. Next time I will purchase locally to ensure better quality nuts.The price is low, but so is the quality."
1,"Doesn't work with newer Palm, Tech support non existant",I bought this program when I had a Palm IIIc. I raved about it. It was a great program until I upgraded to a palm T3. I have emailed Tech support 5 times with no response. They are NON EXISTANT! The program still works on my desktop but will not funtion on the T3. Don't waste your money!
2,"In with a bang, out with a fizzle...","Got the desktop/palm software 1-2 years ago. It works okay, and does basically what I want it to. But, as far as I can tell, the company has flatlined. No new software updates, no enhancements to their product since it came out. And $50 is way too steep. I feel duped. Try something like Diet & Exercise Assistant 5.0, at palmgear.com. It's only $15-20."
4,Mac 2004 Excel,Mac 2004 Excel works up to my expectation. I replaced another spreadsheet program which closed down often when I was working. That is not a problem with Excel.
5,Fantastic Value! Great Sound!,"I was looking for a pair of decently priced, higher quality bookshelf speakers to use as rear surrounds for my home stereo system, and chanced upon these. I must simply say, my expectations were exceeded by far. These could easily function as main speakers, they have plenty of power at 125 Watts, and the bass response is genuinely great. The mids and highs are crystal clear, and I could not ask for more at what I paid, low to mid hundreds. The oak veneer and black grills look great, all in all a great buy. I would definitely purchase these again if I could do it over, although my ONLY complaint is the flimsy front grill, but as that has no impact on sound quality, I rate these 5 stars."
5,So many great examples. Beautiful Pictures and great explaination,This book is well written and includes awesome pictures. I am excited to try my first and subsequent cake decorating adventures from its pages.
3,Classic Wilton,"Photos were large and instructions easy to follow. Techniques as relevant today as they were when book first published. Glossary terms helpful, especially for the novice."
4,interesting look into judge's life,"I was given this book as a gift for my law school graduation. This isn't your ordinary book on the judicial process, but instead, a personal perspective of working to gain the experience and wisdom needed to become a successful federal appellate judge. He takes you through his years as a civil and criminal trial lawyer and you get a great insight into the procedures behind presidential nominations and senate confirmations.There is much to be learned about history from this book, as well. As the author recalls moments from his childhood while growing up in a steel mill town outside of Pittsburgh, you feel like you are having a conversation with a grandfather who's sharing stories about the ""good old days.""Overall, the book was enjoyable and it reads well. It's a great book to read if you are someone who's just starting out in your law career."
2,Not for Me,"The description for this book led me believe and expect much more than I got. Tons of great names but little substance. It's a nice table top book or ""studio"" type book and perhaps thats they way they should sell it. But when you expect to learn advanced techniques from the experts it falls short.I found myself wanting more, not just a teaser project which was just a portion of the ""real thing"". I'm sure it has it's value as well, I was just too disappointed to see it. I got a refund on this one. Too much money for what I got. They even used outdated Flash 4 code in this one---sheesh!!!"
2,Nothing to write Mom about...,"I was not impressed. Better tutorials and designs are available online to the curious surfer. The CD-ROM felt a bit ackward to use and offers little help. Keep this book on your coffe table... to show your friends you're doing 'the Flash thing'. Not worth the hefty price, really."
3,"Well, some if it's good...","If this book had cost $20 less it would have been quite worth it. It certainly isn't for beginners, you'll have to fill in the spaces with knowledge gained somewhere else. But it is inspirational and there are a few good tutorials. I enjoyed Yasuto Suga's section the most, not so much for his tutorial on designing a lightray effect but because his work is so visually stunning. I think all of the step-by-step tutorials should have included more information. I think we would have done better off with more emphasis on the how-to's and not so much on how the artist were inspired. We're all inspired or we wouldn't want to be learning Flash! Overall it's a fun book and I enjoyed reading it, just not paying so much for it!"
1,"If your burner can't read these, toss them!","I've had nothing but grief with this brand of CD-R, and I'm not alone. After figuratively banging my head against the wall for hours trying to troubleshoot my burner, I thought to try another brand of CD-R. Guess what? No problems. If you Google Memorex CD-R, the first thing that pops up are endless reviews trashing this product.Yes, it's cheap, and I really mean cheap. And you get what you pay for.Avoid it!"
5,Enjoyed reading it!,"I think we all know the dryness that exists in most of MS's study guides but I am hear to say that I actually enjoyed this book! It was very informative and used many analogies to paint a clear picture of the information. After reading the book I thought that there must be somthing I was missing for taking this test. I was wrong! I have no networking experience at all! I read the book, enjoyed it, took the test and passed the first time! Wahlah!"
2,Overall a good book but Windows 2000 bias,"Overall the book is pretty good. It is easy to read and follow and it includes practice lessons at the end of each section. However the book is too heavy on Windows 2000. The Server+ exam is supposed to be vendor neutral but you wouldn't know it by reading this book. If you want to pursue MCP or MCSE then this is a good place to start, if you want a book that is not Microsoft bias then skip over this one"
5,Technology!,"If you're looking for a great movie about nothing at all, then ROTOR is your kind of film. The fighting scenes are so realistic and the special effects are so ahead of its time. The wardrobe department did an excellent job on putting together outfits (we love tattered plaid!) Female ROTOR is such an inspiration to young women everywhere. Her color changing mullet, or as we like to call the Chameleon Mullet, is so mesmerizing; we could look at it forever. Watch this movie ""if you know what's good for you."""
1,Very Old - Not helpful,After renting this movie I went to utube and found much better and more up to date videos for sail trimming.
4,good information,I am new to sailing and learn alot from this video. Had to watch it a few times to really learn the info.
1,Tilting at Cinematic Windmills,"This dreadful 1992 ""reconstruction"" of Orson Welles' unfinished ""Don Quixote"" does a tremendous disservice to the legendary filmmaker. Poor dubbing and wildly variable footage make the Spanish project virtually unwatchable, even though Francisco Reiguera and Akim Tamiroff are ideally cast as Don Quixote and Sancho Panza. A documentary utilizing the best photographic elements would have been preferable."
5,This is COOL,"I was not going to spend the money on this... I did get a CHEAPER ONE 1st... Ofcourse it did not work at all....I finaly gave up after 5 attempts to install it.. Than I ordered this one. When it came I opened the package and seen that it only needs to be plugged into a outlet and just 2 wires to hook up... Just loosen the screws on the doorbell inside the house ( The current bell on the wall, and slip the 2 wires in, tighten and ....DONE... simple......Great product"
1,It worked for 10 minutes and then quit.,The unit worked for about 10 minutes and then would not work again.I have returned it to Amazon for a refund.I then purchased a Heath Zenith LE-6157-B Wireless chime which works. This unit has no wires...it has a microphone unit powered by 3 AAA batteries. When the main door chime sounds it transmits a signal to a remote which plugs into any outlet in the house or garage. The remote can be set to sound a variety of chimes. I had it working in 5 minutes.
5,Fantasy Adventure,"This book is amazingly similar in some ways to ""Glory Road"" by RAH, although it predates it. It also has a JRR Tolkein flavor mixed with the general struggle of good and evil.This is a completely enjoyable book that pits a modern day soldier against a fantasy world from his ancestral past.Unlike many fantasy books, it has a very credible plot, fascinating characters, and a very attractive writing style. This has always been my favorite book by Anderson,and still reads very well today."
5,Very good comforter,"I purchased this comforter a year ago from amazon. I live in upper Florida USA and this comforter is all I need on my bed in the summer time. The comforter is of good quality, feels great, and cleans easily. You can buy this comforter and know you got a good product at an EXCELLENT price."
3,This supposedly neat toy is rather disappointing,"I had gotten my two year old this toy, since he loves the pixar cars, and was getting frustrated with his older brother's race tracks,given that none of his pixar cars fit onto any other race tracks. I gave this review three stars simply because there is a track out there now that will accomodate these cars, but both my boys (the older one is 5) loose interest rather quickly....pretty boring, no room for much imaginative play , the hand pump does NOT work, so overall I have to say I find it rather ridiculous to have to pay good money for such a poorly made (the whole thing does not seem overly durable) toy that does not reach expectations, considering how much hoopla is made of the pixar cars and what the box the toy comes in advertises. I had done my research, but still was expecting more than this...you would think they would have the decency to create a sturdy, well-made toy that is more fun than this."
2,"Good spatula, but...","Pretty nice spatula, but the shaft is bit too flexible for my taste :( Also, although it is 9"" in length, this is certainly not a compact spatula."
2,I have read better,"This book is ok. There are some entertaining moments but overall it is a mediocre book.The author uses this book to push his more radical, right wing Christian values. More sadly is that the book bashes gays, equaling them with satanic creatures. In Johnstone's worldview, gays cannot be real Christians.What is bad about this book is that the character development is flat. We never get to know the characters, nor do we get a chance to watch them develop as the ""horror"" builds. One of the best things about a good horror novel is that we get to see the characters respond to the horror and go through their inner demons as they battle the evil. There is not much of that here. People either are evil or good. There is no transition.Want real horror? Try Shirley Jackson, James Herbert, T.E.D. Kline (a rare but worthwhile find), Peter Straub and Robert R. McCammon."
3,A Decent Story,"I read this trilogy from beginning to end. I found that with each book there was a point in the story which made me so frustrated and angry that I had to rush through and get to the end.Meridon is a decent ending to the trilogy, but I didn't find myself having strong feelings of hate, love, or disgust towards these characters the way I did with Wideacre and The Favored Child. I also tired of reading about acrobatics and horses and would have liked more talk about James, Will and Meridon, and Wideacre itself. This book seems more centered on class struggle and economics than the other two books.After reading Wideacre and The Favored Child, I think one must read Meridon. It still is a good read."
2,Just ok.,"I read the other two books in the trilogy and loved them! This was really boring. I enjoyed the last 200 pages of the book but the first 300 pages were tedious at best. The story was dull and boring and no connections with the characters. The first two books far outshine this book, but I like the ending and I'm happy with it as the ending of the trilogy."
3,A departure from the previous two in the series,"I proceeded to plow ahead to the third book in the trilogy, although I'm not sure whether it was due to pure masochism or a silly, desperate thread of hope that ""things have to get better because the series is ending!"" But you know what? They did get better. Hallelujah! This particular installment follows the adventures of the gypsy granddaughter/daughter of the previous books' main characters as she finds out about her heritage (er, yeah) and leaves the life she has known to claim her birthright estate. It's a Cinderella story in a way, with some interesting bits about class struggles and socialism, but I can't really say that the tone fits with the previous books. It's so much happier. I'm rather glad it doesn't because I don't know that my (fragile) emotions could have handled more drama in the vein of the first two, but I can also see how it could come off as anticlimactic for other readers."
4,Get the Vintage version,"Even back when this figure first came out it was a bit stiff. Fortunately, the new Vintage version is great. Check it out here: Star Wars 2011 Vintage Collection Action Figure #30 Zam Wessel"
4,Zam ..,..pretty cool..it helps build to the mystery of 'who is this characer' to bad i read all the spoilers..o' well..awsome sculpt.. for a freekin' cool character..8)
2,2pac Better dayz,"What the hell is this ? the production is bad, the originals are 10 times better... omg if 2pac knew this.. buy me against the world or all eyez on me if you want a album from the best rapper 2 pac"
5,Critic,"I've read some reviews not only here but other sites, and I agree ""Ghetto Star"" is a hot track as for the album it's better than Until the end of time but not better than All Eyes on Me, I've heard it's already platinum, too bad ""Ghetto Star can't be a video or radio cut."
2,womp womp womp,I got love fa Tupac but yo this album jus wadnt hittn the spot.Some of the beats we hot and pac got deep again but it just wadnt all dat great. Pick it up if u want to but I suggest the bootleg version.peace n luv~Rika
2,Very Sad,"I wonder if the producers of this album actually ever listened to Pac. To waste the raw lyrics of someone who can write no longer by combining them with some sort of R&B/Jazz mess of an instrumental is to defame the memory of him. The inflections of his voice are all but drown out from the overboosted inappropriate background. The actual lyrics are tough to hear at times as well, definitely not true to Pac. I've had it for two days, turned it off mid CD (Disk 2) at one point out of sheer disappointment. If the producers let Pac be Pac, and not THEIR interpretation of him, this CD would be incredible. Sadly enough, there is not one truley raw song on either CD, one even sounds country-music like. I gave it two stars out of respect for the man, the album rates negative. See mine on ebay later today. I would pay quadruple for a CD of the raw tracks that he laid down before his demise."
5,Another genius double album.,"This is another album by the lyrical genius 2pac. Here you find meaningful songs, just like in any other 2pac album, listen to ""Who do you believe in"" ""My Block"" and ""Better Dayz"" You won't find songs in this album about Escalades, bling-bling jewelry and nonsense. This is a must have album, if you like rap there is no chance you could be disappointed. Having so many double albums released while not being among us, proves his brilliance in music making, if you were going to buy a CD, go buy Better Dayz."
5,the best of his better dayz,"I normally give every PAC album 5 stars but this one deserves 6. This is classic Tupac right here. The things he says here are things that cant be copied by noone whether its JAY-Z, NAS or JA RULE. YOU cant copy this legend. CD 1 is slightly better then CD 2 but both are still fabulous. Every tupac album is a classic but this is tha bomb right here. A MUST FOR ANY RAP/HIPHOP COLLECTION."
1,bad,idk what yall are selling but that c didnt play at all supposta b brand new thats a lie it hade scratches verywere yall are rip offs
3,Better Dayz,I have to say i disagree with everyone else. This is one of 2pacs worse albums. Not because of the lyrics but because the music is made by different people and in most songs is total [junk]. On a 26 track album I like 3songs. And I am a huge pac fan!
2,Eh...,"There were a few tidbits of information (which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of just 1), but the overall quality of the video is pretty bad. It advertises 100 mistakes, but I think 20 of them were on a failure to have a paper chart. Also, as the previous commenter stated, many of the examples do not provide a corresponding video and you are simply listening to the commentator discuss it. Perhaps the most annoying is that the editing was horrible. It jumps all over, and half way through it appears the video is wrapped up with credits displayed. If you watch past the credits, you will find there is another 25 minutes of content lol. Real amateur video."
1,NOT THE DISNEY VERSION!!!,Shame on Amazon for not making it clear that these are NOT the Disney versions of Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin.
4,Overall good book.,"What I liked about this book:Re-visiting Lucky & Devon.Marcie's transformation from the ugly duckling to an attractive, successful business woman & of course, the ending.What I didn't like:The cruel, insulting way Chase treated Marcie through the beginning of the book.The way Marcie let him.But this is still a keeper."
3,"OK read, but seems dated.","I loved this book and the entire Texas! series when they first came out. When I was going through some old books, I remembered how much I liked this one and reread it. It's amazing how quickly it has aged. It's still a pleasant read, but the idea of a successful thirty-five year old woman being so desperate to marry that she would propose to a man she hardly knew seems incredibly old-fashioned. Admittedly I might feel this way because I'm older and more successful than I was when I first read this book and can't begin to fathom why anyone wouldn't love the lifestyle, but it still smacks of old-fashioned thinking. I actually looked at the date the book was published and was shocked to find that it came out in 1991. Also, being a Texan, the dark days of the oil bust seem so far away now. Anyway, this is a nice light read, but it's not going on my keeper shelf."
4,Very detailed,i like to collect horror memorabilia and this is one of the most detailed bobble heads ive ever seen. It is made of heavy resin material and the paint is amazing. At a close glance the pins are actually a gold color and the thing itself is pretty heavy. Very good quality product and one of the best toys i own
1,Blain Brown,"The explanation of most concepts is convoluted, also the chapter arrangement is illogical. When reading this book, I was consistently forced to refer to other textbooks and reference books because the book was poorly written."
3,A beginner's guide to Kabbalah,"A good primer for those that are interested in basic knowledge and historical roots for Kabbalah. Filled with pictures and charts, you can come away and actually remember what it is you read. I wasn't particularly thrilled with the attempt of the author to blend in other various religions as authoritative. Of course there are similarities but this hardly makes them legitimate. The beautiful illistrations are this book's saving grace. However, there are better books on Kabbalah."
5,Works great on the patio!,"I was getting tired of not hearing the doorbell when I was out in the backyard with my daughter so I purchased this and asked my husband to install it. It took him 15 minutes and after a year of it being up under our patio it's still working flawlessly. I don't know why I didn't get one sooner,It's loud when you're right next to it but I really like the fact that my packages won't be sitting on my porch for extended periods anymore because I didn't hear the doorbell.Great buy!"
2,Buyer beware - there are ocean sounds in the background,"Any buyer of this product should be aware that this CD combines a very good performance of Vivaldi's Four Seasons and other works with the sound of rolling waves in the background, which in my opinion completely ruin this CD. This CD is only for those who wish to feel as if they are listening to an orchestra on the beach. Even if this could be a good idea the wave sounds themselves are much too loud compared to the music."
1,"These are not ""Christie"" style stories -","I returned these DVD's after viewing the first few disc's, The stories are warped and do not leave you entertained. This was the experience we had after watching a few episodes - they are not ""Christie"" like in either plot or acting.So if your looking for a entertaining,cozy mystery - along the genre of Foyle, Poirot, or Midsomer - This DVD collection is NOT it."
5,Its Good,"After reviewing THE REVIEWS here, I know I can't really top them. Let me sum it up for you: Its good. Yeah, its got some Wicca in it.Yeah, she forgets to tell us why Karim has it in for Heather, and yeah, its great that we have a heroine who looks just a little bit like a real person, so yeah, its a good book. Not great. Not horrible, just good reading. Historic gardens, Mazes, Historic Houses. Mythology. ENGLAND. ROMANCE. GARDENS. MICHAELS. GET IT NOW!"
5,Review of A Walk to Remember,"I love the movies A Walk to Remember, this is my 3rd DVD , i wore out the other two.The Pay it Forward was a BONUS! Great movie...every child in school should see these movies."
2,More like an 80's aerobics workout at the gym than a real yoga workout,"While I appreciate the sincere attempt done to translate yoga into a Christian perspective, at the same time this DVD moves at a pace that is way too fast for anyone who has really studied yoga. It's as if the producers of this DVD didn't want to delve too far into the tantric side of yoga for fear of losing themselves in it. Furthermore, the choppy cinematography makes me want to laugh out loud. What's the point of doing yoga if you have to rush into the next position to keep up?"
2,"It's a cute book, but....","First, the other reviewer is correct when stating that there's something wrong about carefully distinguishing between Italy, Germany, and France... but then having one person from ""Latin America"" and another from ""Asia"". These are continents, not countries - continents with diverse ethnic groups and cultures, and, of course, many different nations.I also found the format of the book, while visually interesting, to be difficult and frustrating to read. It's hard to manage as a read-aloud... and it may also be too complicated for some young readers."
1,Quickly Lost Luster,"As an NYC ex-pat this book really wowed me when I first saw it. Reading through it a couple of times now, I realize it relies very heavily on (some rather nasty) stereotypes. We don't read this book anymore."
3,"OK guys, please don't kill me!","OK, please listen to me first. Well, I was so excited when this came out from the oven, and I couldn't wait to buy it. Well, it was a good book, if it wasn't following Return to Del. Really, it's a good book, but it's just, well... When I was reading Return to Del, I was expecting something good, but it totally exceeded my expectations! I thought Shadowlands would be the same, but the plot was less... exciting. It's still a good book though, actually, but it came just at the wrong time."
5,Movie is Great! DVD transfer sucks!,"This movie is fun all around. Fun script, Color, Art direction, Music great for its time.I recomend renting before you buy though if your a collector.The film print they chose for dvd transfer is horrible.I am not being picky either. Its worst i have ever scene on dvd especially at beginning and spots in middle.Lots of scratches to point sometimes that they stand out over the film.This movie deserves more care and respect I think from all involved in making the dvd."
3,Still can't work it,I can't get my Palm to configure w/my computer. I don't think it's the cradle though- I think it's the user. :) Palm does not fit very snuggly into the cradle. Bad design.
5,Great for those beginner designers,"This book was excellent! I am a web developer and I've gotten more and more into the design side. I was asked to design logos, newsletters and advertising email as well as websites. I decided to get some design books.A. This book was a quick read.B. This book covers 4 priniciples, gives GREAT examples and really teaches you quicklyC. The way it presents information, intro-meat-review with examples that tie together each principle is great.It gives beginning desigers a great first step into the world of design with principles you can start to apply immediately. Even if you're a beginner and designing reports, newsletter, ads, websites or anything else this book is a great read! Try your local library for a copy, as it's too short to keep around for reference :)."
2,Is that it?,"This book should have been titled ""Last minute design dos and don'ts"" or something like that.It's written in the style of a magazine article and not what one would expect from a BOOK. It took me one hour to read (not browse) through the whole thing and although I admit I got one or two good pointers out of that hour, I don't know if it was worth my money.I was expecting a book with some advanced concepts written in a language that the common people would also understand but the book is extremely general.I guess if you have zero clue as to what a webpage is and/or how to creat a homepage, this book could be a good prelude to what you're going to buy later because it definitely is NOT enough."
4,DIY For All,"If you are a person who would rather learn things by yourself and enjoy using graphic software packages to create home made graphic stuff for whatever use, then this book will come in handy to show you the very basics of visual composition for desktop publishing in a very simple straightforward manner. I for one, pay a lot more attention to aestethic aspects and get better results after I read this little masterpiece."
4,Good enought for its price and intended readers!,"I have been looking at the reviews and almost everyone that rated this book with a poor rating were experienced designers. I think it is inapt and unfair to rate it this badly because these people have failed to read the obvious - its title. It says for ""non-designers"". This book is not intended for them in the first place! These ""designers"" come in to the review board and make all kinds of noises that this book is not worth the buy. They should at least find out if a book they chose to read is suited to their knowledge level. Besides, given the price of the book one can't expect everything. Please give the author a break and think before criticizing. I like this book based on its contents and readibility. Well, it's certainly worth my buy."
2,This sickens me.,"when EA sports says it has the #1 hockey franchise ever. Well, if you wanted to know why its because it has no {explicit} competition for the past 10 years!well, lets look at the few positives that it has.Pros: 1.Realistic Shooting.(finally)2.EA trax gives us ACTUAL and GOOD music.(finally)And now the Cons.Cons: 1.A lot of em2.In-game passing is horrid3.Scores in 20 minute periods are unrealistic4.Player control is depressing5.A franchse mode that hasnt improved since NHL 20016.Play-by-Play gets repetitive fast7.EA Online costs $$$ this year8.""New"" pictures were taken at the start of last seasonPerplexing: when will someone ever come out with a good hockey game?The verdict: dont buy this if you have 2002 or 2001. only if you have 2000 or 99 for comp or just want to be kept up with statistics"
4,"I prefer NHL 2002, but this has more action and graphics","NHL 2002 was my first game for Playstation 2, and I loved it. The new one has, of course, this year's rosters, but until I found the menu to speed it up, I was frustrated. IT CAN BE SPEEDED UP TO LAST YEAR'S SPEED- but again, it's a menu item. The graphics are greatly improved, and yes, the announcer guy is still annoying, but the music has gotten annoying. I liked last year's more, and at the same time the music this year is kind of featured in a way so as to appear as a music video. Wierd, and lesser quality music. My nephew has never seen a hockey game, but all he wanted to do once he saw it was play, play, play- so if you want a good game, this could be the one, but go into your menu screen early!"
3,Some Good - Some Bad,"NHL 2002 was a great game that needed a few fixes to make it perfect. NHL 2003 is not the fix that was needed. Heres the good and the bad,The Bad1)Game Play is Slow2)Editing Lines is harder as not all relevent player information is displayed, forcing you to keep switching to the rosters list3)Sound and Graphics Issues keep popping up here and thereThe Good1)Goalies play better2)Passing and Shots are more realistic3)Menus are easy and display all the info you need right up front.All in all its a good game but could be better. The biggest problem is the Game Speed. Its not your hardware that is slow its the game itself. In NHL 2002 you could increase the game speed, the spped bursts and more here it has the options but very little effect. Also Direct3D and DirectX 8.1 Compat. is needed on your Video Card. Its a fun Game but not an improvement over NHL 2002"
5,Love it!!!!,"Francoise Hardy has a voice like silk. I love this album and plan to purchase her album in English. Her music and voice are so soothing...I listen to this album in my car on the way to work in the mornings. Also, if you are learning French, as I am, signing along with this album definately helps with the learning process!"
5,Well made basic tool,I needed this serated bit to adjust the trunk latch on VW Jetta. It fit perfectly and it is well made.
2,Bandwagoneers,"In any other year Paloalto may have been a middling effort, sincere and somewhat overblown, but quite ok. However, trailing in the wake of a thousand and one (mostly British) bands like Travis, Doves, Coldplay Deckard, Witness, Muse, et al who all ape Jeff Buckley and Thom Yorke's keening voice and melodramatic style, Paloalto is quite painful to listen to. They are definitely the most American of the ""delicate boy's voice over raging guitars"" bit, but they have nothing interesting to say. Shame on Rick Rubin and the folks at Columbia/American Recording who thought that they could jump on the bandwagon--as always, the third generation is a distant xerox of the originals. Undoubtedly someone will claim that they are a wonderful band with much rock passion and so forth, well, to each their own, but if you would be better off getting ""The Man Who"" or ""OK Computer"" or even Grandaddy's ""Sophtware Slump."" Incidentally, avoid at all costs Witness UK's album, as it is complete crap."
1,There are better options that are free,"I did not pay for my US Travel Card -- it was a free promotion from Office Depot when I purchased my Palm m505. And this is fortunate, since I would have been very upset if I would have paid for it. The information this card contains is very limited and is only for a very small number of cities -- and as far as I can tell, there is no way of adding/updating the information.If you need information about cities, I'd recommend going with the free Vindigo service instead."
1,Stay away from this miserable software,Palm's US travel card bottoms the pile of plain and simple useless software products- how can a company that caters to the professional dare to publish this type of useless 16MB travel info- there is nothing good to be said about this product and Palm even charges a hefty price: Instead use the internet and the many excllent trip helpers and city guides that are availabe on line for free.
3,the map,I was impressed by the information but the map does not work at all on zire 71 if you just need info its ok. direction are lacking but info still good.
4,Good Buy!,DisimilarI received the item on time and was pleased that the product was in exact condition as stated when I purshased it. Thank You So Much :)
3,"Good holster, but...","This holster is nice, well made and worth the money. I've had Bianchi holster's before and there good holster's, but this is a first with a revolver (329PD). What i don't like about it is the inside thumb snap scratch's the cylinder. I'm hoping I'll be able to buff it out. It's not exactly a deep cut but still not an option for me. I'll be returning this and looking for a different."
3,Good for beginners,"If you're looking to start a trivia night in your area, its a good reference book to start with. The beginning is well explained, and the questions are pretty good but dated at this point. I did find a couple of inaccuracies too, so best to watch out for that.I also could do without the recipes that take up the final 1/3 of the book. The purchaser (you) really can't use them for any meaningful purpose if you're looking for info on how to run a trivia night."
1,"Hackneyed, and disappointing","This seemed to have a great premise: how a military disaster that occurred 2,500 years ago could have modern ramifications. However, it turned out to be a slow-moving, pedestrian ""boy and girl running away in the wilderness from evil people"" tale. Every cliche appears: the pebble slipping down the hill, giving the good guys' position away; the kindly ""Columbo"" like under-rated detective; the coincidences that lead our heroes to run into EXACTLY the particular people who have the unique knowledge they need--at just the right times. Oh, and, of course, the Americans in the novel are all sadistic, boorish louts.Save your money."
1,The Lost Army Of Cambyses,"This book has a really great story line, but in my opinion it was not well written. I was more interested in the lost army of Cambyses and was disappointed to find that it was just a backdrop for the real story which had nothing to do with Cambyeses.The story line is difficult to follow at times and could have been developed better along more classic lines. The author chose to follow lines of thinking that, I believe, interfered with the story line and actually detracted from what could have been a truly great story. The sexual content that was added was sadistic and violent and detracted from the content of the story as well. It is too bad, because the story line was such, that it could have been a classic which could have been enjoyed by multitudes of readers for years to come had it been developed better."
3,"Decent, but not up to his usual standards","If ""Life Is Messy"" were an album by most any other artist it would be a fairly impressive piece of work. But judging it by the previous standards set by such Rodney Crowell work as ""Diamonds & Dirt"" and the superb ""Keys to the Highway"" it falls far short, and can even be branded a disappointment. While many of the songs are memorable, none of them are really up to the standards of Crowell's best and a few even come across as a bit half baked. After setting the bar as high as he did on ""Diamonds"" and ""Keys,"" however, one can't really begrudge him from taking a bit of a breather.This is not to say isn't a decent album, as it clearly is, but for new comers to Crowell it is certainly not the best place to start. Either ""Diamonds,"" ""Keys,"" or Crowell's extraordinary new gem ""The Houston Kid"" can all vie for that honor."
1,Disappointing,"I bought this CD because of the reviews of Rodney Crowell's other recordings and, sadly, found this a great disappointment - the lyrics to the songs are very good, but he sings them in a monotone and the music to every song sound just like all the others."
2,The only way to sell the one movie is to bundle it with the other,"Defending your life is a cute movie, too bad they had to package it with the crappy movie of Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World. Yawn."
4,Worthwhile,"I've read previous old-timers interviews and they were interesting. But the fact that these are new and also, as it says in the introduction, that they were videotaped to be put into the Cooperstown files made them worth looking into for me. It's like Bob Feller - and the rest of them - on the record in the Hall. And I liked some of the game-within-the-game info in the book, like Warren Spahn talking about the not quite legal pitches they threw in those days: Lew Burdett's spitball, Gaylord Perry's Vaseline ball and (new to me) Whitey Ford's mud-ball. All in all, I thought the book was a worthwhile addition to the old-timers interview side of baseball."
4,The Best Of The Marxes Last Six Movies,"A glorious return to the free wheeling Marx comedies of their Paramount days. Enhanced by crisp editing and great dialouge GO WEST packs plenty of great fun into a short 79 minutes. Though there's no Margret Dumont(Animal Crackers, Duck Soup, Opera, Races, Circus, Store) there is a Themla Todd(Horse Feathers, Monkey Business)like vixen. And the songs are quite enjoyable (a rarity for an MGM Marx film). Groucho especially seems to be enjoying himself dispite his claims that he never had fun making movies. T I M B E R !"
5,My TV is no longer my best friend...,"... my microwave is a 1000 watt cure for the lonlies. Instead of submerging myself in 700 club reruns to try to find a sense of purpose, I do so in ""5 minute mac and cheese""."
3,Concepts in Federal Taxation 2008 Edition Murphy & Higgins,"Yesterday 6/15/09, I went toward University and take the book for consulting over deductions and IRA , saw amazed that chapter 14,15 was incomplete.This product have one defect in your pages, the book have not pages since 647 to 678, therefore, I believe that these products should be revised for you and what's more have good image over your institution.Thank you.One Customer"
3,Does the French version have more,"The ""palomino"" is actually the flax-tressed Lindsay Frost as a recently divorced photojournalist who sets her sights on a hunky horseman played by Lee Horsley. More flannel-tearing than bodice-ripping, the bosoms still heave as shutterbug and cowboy begin a hot-n-heavy affair among the Quarterhorses and haybales. Tragedy strikes and the suds lather, but Palomino is a well-done weepie for romantics who also like horses. There's a nice subplot involving therapeutic riding for disabled children. Based on a novel by Danielle Steele.Staci Layne Wilson"
3,brooklyn friends,an interesting collection of photos of youths living in brooklyn during the 50'sim not quite sure why this is referred to as a gang--as there is no gang type of life really shown in these images. a better name for this book should have been BROOKLYN FRIENDS
2,Melodrama...and the emperor!,"While this is an impressive work, it has many qualities that keep me from recommending it. Others have mentioned the dearth of dates for historical context. I will concentrate on the most aggravating quality of all.Ludwig's use of the present tense is an affectation that not only grates but casts doubt. Is this history or fiction? Combine this with his penchant for melodramatic exclamations and it frequently feels like you are on a ""living history"" bus tour with William Shatner as guide: ""Look! There comes Napoleon down the street! Now he will exact his revenge on Paoli. Never again shall they laugh at Bonaparte. Insolent fools!""The information can be insightful but I can't tell where the facts end and the fanciful editorializing begins."
4,Shattered Mind,"Great Wolfgang Petersen mystery! When Tom Berenger awakes from a bad car accident he finds he can not remember much. He begins to see flashbacks and his conversations with others help him to realize who he really was and who was murdered. This is one of the better movies I have seen Berenger in and I enjoyed it. Good supporting cast, music, and sets. Well worth owning on DVD. If you like this be sure to catch Tom in ""Shoot To Kill"" which will also be out on DVD soon and in ""Sniper""."
2,Kind of an early 90s relic,"Tom Berenger is the lead here, but he's kind of expressionless as the architect who can't remember. It's a standard amnesia thriller. Bob Hoskins has a key role as a private eye, but he plays it like a TV detective show, so it's less than interesting. There are no scary parts, but the plot does thicken as the thing goes along, somewhat ploddingly. I wasn't hooked at any point. It also suffers a number of unrealistic situations, such the end when everyone flies off in a cop helicopter, ignoring the burning wreck below. That would not happen. This seems more dated than 1991 to me."
1,Glad I Waited,I was truly disappointed with the soundtrack selection on this CD and I'm glad I waited and bought it used and at a relatively inexpensive price.
4,Niiiice,Dallas Austin did a real good job recruiting on this one. The best song would definitely be the marching band medley which even has remakes of Mystikal. That was real cool. Track 1 will make your head bob too. Niiice.
2,It doesn't fit!!!!,"Okay - I read the reviews, I saw the product on Amazon and really really liked the look and functionality of theproduct. I got one! I still like it, it is very functional but my Palm simply falls out of it! This kind iof makes it pretty useless as a protective cover for my palm!I have had the case for a whole day and (I do like it!) but I am taking it back since it fails in its primary function - protecting my palm! I placed it in my backpack and simply walking for a short while saw my palm dislodged and floating around in my bag! Now when I say backpack - it's a laptop backpack and isn't full of junk or things rattling 'round (no I'm not a Uni student!!) so my palm didn't get damaged.I was happy with my purchase but it just doesn't work!"
2,Shoddy Workmanship,"Not a bad case, but the stylus attached to the case, which is supposed to slide into the slot on the left side of the Palm, fits into the slot much too loosely. As a result the Palm can and does easily slide out. That's not acceptable for a product that's supposed to shield the Palm from being dropped and broken. I solved the problem cheaply (and effectively) with Velcro, but Palm shouldn't sell products that need repair at the outset."
2,it's ok,"i find w/this case the palm goes on often cause the on/off switch is not well-protected. However, it has wallet storage for bills and cc's. often times the palm slips out. Don't love it, but it's the only real game in town since no one sells a replacement of the original flip cover it came with."
1,Bad Design,"This case looks good and that is about it.Zero thought was put into the design of this case. The belt-clip is very difficult to clip on due to its design. The back of the clip is only a third as long as the front. When clipping onto your belt the back gets caught every time. To fully put it on the clip needs to be stretched open. No. It is not spring loaded or hinged. Once it is on, it is clamped there. Watch you don't tear your pants trying to remove it. The swivel? Ho-hum.The magnetic closure is a nice idea but badly executed. The clasp on this case holds the flap out a full centimeter (3/8""+) from the body of the case. Not practical at all for something you're wearing on your belt and don't wan't flapping in the breeze or catching your arm or anything else in close quarters.This case is also just small enough that the flip cover does not fit. Not good.If there were zero stars, this case would earn them."
4,In the Spirit of the Hamptons,"Bensimon's depiction of the ultimate vacation destination is not only historical, and factually correct, but is also incredibly interesting to read. Bensimon's take on social history is fascinating as it is impressive how she fused Amercia's past with such an amazing location. This title is typical of Bensimon; clever, approachable, and aspirational. The artist section is a real treat, and clues us in to the behind the scenes of what we call modern art today. Congrats, kelly"
2,If you are bored and have absolutely nothing to do......,"It was amusing to say the least. You really don't have to think real hard when watching this movie. You will probably laugh at the classic scene taken from ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"". As for that, just sit back and relax and let your mind zone. You may even feel like taking a smoke and drinking a beer. That is all you are going to get from this movie."
5,All-time favorite,"This is one my all time favorite movies. Sure it's full off corny one liners, and predictable action shots, but that, for me, is just part of it's charm. If you love to cheer for the good guys, and hiss at the bad guys, this is a movie for you. If you're lookin for a deep meaningful plot with lots of brainy twists, you aren't looking for an action movie in the first place. This movie will not keep you on the edge of your seat, or give you anything deep to contemplate after you've watched it. It will simply entertain you while you watch it,and isn't that what a movie is supposed to do."
4,I finally found it! =D,"I have been looking for this parfum for ages because nobody seems to have it in their stores anymore.I'm glad I found it here on Amazon cause I finished my first bottle years ago. I really like the scent (although the smell of this one evaporates quicker than I remembered, that's why I rated it 4 stars)If you have the tendency to avoid really sweet fragrances (as I do) and you're looking for a nice, fresh, light scent to wear everyday. This is it!Well packaged, had no problem with the seller and it arrived on time."
5,G By Giorgio,"The reason I choose this Parfum, is because this is the only parfum my wife would wear I bought it for her Birthday she was quite surprise and Happy."
1,JBS,I have been buying this perfume for years from The Perfume spot and Fragrence net and never had a problem. Tried it through Amazon and Perfume World and as far as I can tell it is fake. If it isn't fake it is very old. The bottle does not have the signiture G on it and it does not smell right or last. Of course I did not realize any of this until it was to late to return. I have never bothered to write a review before but I'm not happy and don't want others disappointed too.It's a great perfume but don't order from Perfume World and if you do it's at your own risk.
5,I read this in middle school in 1959,I read this book in 1959. It was actually the first novel I couldn't put down. I started reading and finished the book in two sittings. This is a great feat for someone who had never finished any other book he started reading. I highly recommend Elephant Hill. It has to be one of the greats.
5,Addictive!,"For someone who never plays video games, I was hooked from Day 2 (took a day to get to it since I'm always so busy!)Oh my, you get sucked in! It's alomst scary how much you get involved in trying to control all these little lives in your virtual reality Simtown.... I had spent one whole weekend off playing nonstop (only stopping for bathroom breaks and a snack here and there) for almost 34 hours! That was when my Sim-mania was @ its worst, but anyone I know who has played this game understands the whole addiction thing. *chuckle* I have toned it way down, but have added 3 expansion packs and am getting ready to upgrade the newest expansion ""Superstar"" --- a fun game to play, definitely worth the $ for the starter Deluxe edition, the rest is just icing on the cake :) Have fun & Sim away!"
1,Unfair,"I don't think it's fair that the gamers who have been loyal to teh sims and already have all of the expansion packs are getting left out, while the brand new gamers get a special edition including cool new stuff. Very uncool."
1,Umm....Get a life....a REAL one,"This is corny. People...go get some excercise. Talk to REAL people. Visit REAL places. Throw a REAL party. Dont buy this game and then sit around letting the whole REAL world go by. Seriously, if you arent twelve years old with a 7 pm curfew, there is no reason to sit around doing this nonsense all day."
1,Disappointing,The game got here on time but when I tried it on my computer it said that the sims was experiencing a problem and I tried it on all my other computers and it said the same thing. I'm not sure whether to keep trying or to send it back.
4,Improvment with ADD,"I've had the game for about a month now and not only is it fun, it seems to be helping me handle my Attention Deficit Disorder more easily. I notice my own time and task managment skills are improving as I learn to steer the Sims through their days without mishaps. My ability to concentrate appears to be improving also. It is my first game and I really enjoy it. The only problem I have with it is that the Sims don't seem to have enough time to do all they need to do each day and still manage to have fun. And now the game wants them to adopt a baby!"
4,TAKES UP COMPUTER SPACE!!,"My mom one christmas got me the sims deluxe edition. Little did we know though that the sims takes up a lot of computer space. It made our computer super slow and it would freeze up a lot. If you choose this game, you should take caution of ,how much space in your computer you have."
4,"The sims, a game for all ages","WOW! This game was excellent, it features all the great things in the regular combined with the cool things in the living large expansion pack. You want a great and fun sim experience, go on and try the deluxe edition of sims, you won't be sorry after you take a look, you'll be addicted!"
1,Knew it!,"I jut knew this was going to happen! There's a huge craze and everyone buys it, then they come out with a better version. Might as well say ""No one buy this it will come out again better!"" It's a total rip! : -("
1,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!,"Giving this one star is much more than it deserves!! We purchased this game for Christmas for our 12 yr. old son...Call me old-fashioned but this certainly does not represent what we want our child to play. Ex: marry more than 1 sim (polygamy)just try another marriage without divorce, move in with same sex sim, sleep with whomever (child/adult), love triangle etc. I encourage parents to monitor this type of junk being sold to our impressionable children. Please read the instruction booklet,especially pages 31-35 and then decide if you want your child playing this type of trash..."
4,"A great album, hip-hop or otherwise","I'm not a hip-hop fanatic; I listen to a very wide variety of artists crossing many genres and categories. That said, this is a very impressive album, hip-hop or otherwise. Intelligent, original and creative, it showcases Cage's wide range of abilities and styles. The music is extremely listenable and the lyrics are smart and engaging on most tracks. A couple tracks felt a bit flat and/or pandering, hence 4 out of 5 stars.This album was originally recommended to me by a friend, so I downloaded it via a P2P site. I liked it enough to buy it for the friend who recommended it (they having only heard someone else's copy) and burned a copy for myself. I got into it enough that I wanted to support the artist as well as own the real thing, so I purchased it proper."
4,Good but not the best Fuel,"""Something Like Human"" the Sophmore effort from Fuel is a great album but it doesn't quite measure up to their previous album ""Sunburn"". I enjoyed that album a lot more. Don't get me wrong though this album does have its share of great songs. The best in my mind being the album's first single ""Hemorrhage (In My Hands)"" I just can't stop listening to that song. My other favorite tracks include ""Bad Day"",""Innocent"", and ""Down"". I give ""Sunburn"" 5 Stars and this album 4 because it is still a decent album all things considered. Everyone go buy it"
3,"Great rock album, but lots of filler songs","Despite of what i thought from the three radio releases ive herd it was a great rock album.Last Time is a good fast intro, empty spaces was a good rock ballad. Down is a hard song. Scars is a good, slower but still hard song. Prove is one of my favourite songs, it has amazing riffs, dude! I strongly recommend you to own this cd if you like soft rock like lifehouse, limp bizkit korn and linkin park (enemies), or System of a down, filter, and pressure 4-5(Kings).......But their is a good deal of filler songs"
4,Consistant,If you liked the singles hemorhage(sp?) and Innocent then you will really enjoy this CD. It's worth the money.
3,For Fans Only,"Unless you're a hardcore X-23 fan, you're not going to like this figure. The styling and facial features are a little off, and not a faithful representation of the character. I'm giving it 3 stars because I happen to be a huge fan of the character and just had to have it. If you're a fan, I'd recommend it but otherwise, there are other Marvel figures that are a lot cooler."
5,The book tells it as I remember it.,"I worked for Bill and Morris on Kodiak around the same time as the author. I went to visit Morris a few years ago and he gave me a copy of this book. He said it was close to the real thing. Since Bill told most of the stories and Bill was a real story teller, some things may have been a little em-BILL-ished so to speak. If you have ever sat in a hunting camp telling stories around a wood stove at night then you know what I mean. The parts of the book that were told to the author by Morris are dead on the mark. Morris didn't talk much and when he did he told it like it was. The book describes pretty well what it was like to hunt with Bill and Morris on Kodiak Island. It was hard, cold, wet, tireing work most of the time. I loved it. I would do it again if I had the chance. I read the book as I know most of the guys that worked for P&T do, just to bring back memories of how it was."
4,Pretty good so far...,"We bought this because I like Monet. But as earlier stated, it doesn't have a whole lot of paintings. My 5 month old has been watching this for a few months and seems to enjoy it. His favorite is Baby Mozart. I like that the only talking is when the seasons change. I also like that there are plenty of scene changes."
1,Worst Baby Einstein Ever!,"This does not hold my toddler's interest at all. The puppets are really bad, and there are no toys. He cries when I put it in because he doesn't want to watch this one. Do not buy it...it is a waste of money."
1,bad VHS tape,"this was a poor quality used VHS tape, that I had to dump.The vendor should have known that."
5,Very Tranquil,"Other reviewers are correct, this is not the most exciting Baby Einstein Video. However, for my family that is the beauty of ""Baby Monet"" it provides subtle natural colors and soothing music. As the title indicates the video revolves around the changing of the seasons and how they bring new experiences. Spring brings flowers and rain, Summer is full of warmth.... and so one.What we love about Baby Monet is that it is a very soothing video. It is perfect for when our daughter is a bit fussy or when she is ready for bed. My wife and I actually enjoy watching the video with our daughter since it is very relaxing. We could do without the puppet giraffes, but we do enjoy watching the changing colors and tones that are introduced with each season.Final Verdict - I could see how Baby Monet may not hold the attention of a 2-year old boy., but for our 6-month old daughter is *almost* the only video that she watches!5 Stars"
2,A little boring but ok,"My 10 month old sister was bored with it early on, although she did enjoy the parts with the puppets. Otherwise, it was a little too slow moving to keep her attention."
1,Spam is Spam,"The author seems to understand many old mass marketing tricks, but is clueless about the Internet. Spam by any other name is still spam. Mark Twain would, I suspect, be turning his acid tongue to the spammers, not joining them. I highly recommend avoiding this book."
5,"""Animals Are Beautiful People"" DVD","Our son remembered ""Animals Are Beautiful People"" from his childhood. It used to be broadcast on TV and we would record it on a VCR. He asked me to get him a copy for his 28th birthday. Upon getting the DVD, he claimed that he first heard and learned excerpts from famous music while watching this video. It is a delightful, funny video, entertaining for children and adults. That is rare to find. It is an older video, but I think it is timeless especially for animal lovers. It is made by the same people who made ""The Gods Must Be Crazy"".Animals Are Beautiful People"
5,Hilarious,The funniest animal documentary i've ever seen.I watched it on HBO after it first came out several years ago and loved it.You want a good laugh watch it!
5,One of the best African Wildlife movies ever,"Incredible photography of Namibian Desert life, Okavongo Swamp, wildlife, etc. Very entertaining and informative. In the tradition of Disney's ""Living Desert"" type with lots of humor and facts."
5,A Must of Horror Readers,"Caitlin R. Kiernan's Tales of Pain and Wonder is a superb volume, and is requisite reading for all afficianados of dark fiction. However, I was very disappointed in the quality of this edition and prefer the hardback. From the garish cover to a text fraught with printer's errors, the paperback does a disservice to Kiernan's exquisite prose."
3,still evaluating,"The breakin period is going quit easily. The soules are flexable and has the most room for all brands of boots in same size. The tongue is a little different to fold when you lace up and is untested for water proof to date. The back of the boot is 8"" as advertised but the front is 10"" on laces. This difference has not effected comfort when walking. I do like the 8"" backs when walking down hill. They seem to keep feet warm but have not truely been tested by cold weather yet. I am some what confident they will preform in the warmth section even though the material thickness feels thin in toe & ball wight area. Lastly, Sportsmansguide sells same boot for $119.97 + S&H.;Will know a lot more at the end of hunting season how well they preform."
5,Rubico is a future classic!,"If you love both Irish and Folk music, Rubicon is an excellent addition to your CD library. When you add singers like Orla Fallan (of Celtic Woman)to the talents for the Duggans you have the formula for outstanding listening. I have enjoyed it and I think you will too."
5,Hilarious!I,I saw this movie in a theater in Provo. I laughed harder than I've laughed in a movie theater in a long time. It was witty and hilarious. One of my new favorite movies of all time!
1,Design Flaw?,"I received the headlamp yesterday and returned it today. Once the three provided batteries were installed, the latch for the battery compartment would pop open whenever the tilt was adjusted. In my opinion, the battery compartment is designed too small. For a premium product, this was disappointing."
5,Hands free Lighting,"Very Good product to have when working were lighting is bad. Last for Hours and is still bright. I bought one for myself and for my two Sons to keep in there car and walking into the woods for Hunting season, It also has different light settings."
5,Gotta have the red filter,"Terrific product for reading, camping - and particularly with the red filter for night fishing. Good Battery life and high level illumination."
5,Great little light,"I bought two of these, one for my boy scout grandson and one for myself. It came in very handy when I had to do some plumbing in a dark closet replacing my water heater. Nothing like having that light on your head and being able to use both hands. It also worked well during a power outage. It's very bright and can be irritating to people nearby. The strap is comfortable for long periods of use. Very light weight, you almost forget it's there. Highly recommend this light, and the price was excellent."
5,"Good price, amazing quality.","Ive had this headlamp for 4+ years, a damn good light, I would recommend it to anyone in the market for a headlamp."
2,"CHEAPLY MADE,POORLY DESIGNED!","Just received my Petzl tacticca plus headlamp.What a poorly designed hunk of junk! It works but but is just badly made.First,the opening to the casing is at the top,so every time you adjust the angle of the light,it pops open spilling out the batteries,because they did'nt provide enough material to make the door stay closed.Also at the bottom the case is too small,so there is a gap of about a 1/4"".In lieu of hinges,there are 2 fabric straps which keep the case from falling apart,but which when you open the case at all,they push the batteries out.I will need to tape it closed,just to be able to use it! At 40+ dollars,this is a huge rip off!You can get a mini mag flashlight made of aircraft aluminum for much less!Just stealing peoples hard earned money.Will never buy another product from them,that's for sure.There must be better ones."
1,"two lamps, two duds","I ordered two of the headlamps,one works fine, the other would not stay closed. I finally figured out that the battery was not seating correctly and kept the cover from closing shut.Sent it back, not interested in trying it again. It is now 9/12 and I have the same problem with the second lamp, the batteries will not stay in place and the lamp goes out. I have no way of contacting the seller, so this is my only way to say, don't buy it!!!"
2,Petzl quality?,"Petzl used to be synonymous with Quality..... however I am finding my expensive purchase is not even as good a quality as some of the $20 cheapo headlamps at walmart. Petzl needs to address this or just lose business altogether. I purchased a couple of these headlamps for bug out bags for family members and I am not sure they will survive the long haul after looking them over. They work, but not what I expected from Petzl."
4,Great item for imagination,"This is a great for using your imagination. However, this particular item is selling for a higher price here. I'd shop this item and other K'Nex items."
5,Happy with the service,"I haven't had a chance to watch the DVD yet, because I was waiting to get a new TV, but I am sure I will be very happy with the quality of it as I am happy with the quality of the ordering and delivery service. It seems as thought I had it in less than a week, very fast, though I always try to pick companies that are closer to me, so the product doesn't have to come as far."
4,"For C programmers, Fortran programmers get a challenge","For the undergraduate or graduate student who programs in C, this book is a well-written and informative introduction to MPI programming. However, for the old-school Fortran programmer, the book offers little guidance. Typical students today will be writing code in C (or its derivatives), and so the choice of programming language is logical, but I have still spent a lot more time online looking up MPI Fortran code and syntax than using the book.Overall, the text itself is solid and readable. A Fortran version of the text would be nice, but the online code snippets are good enough to get you started."
3,"100 ft, 5/8"" 8 Ply Garden Hose is more suited to a DIY/handyman","The product is a bulky,heavy duty hose geared more to a handyman/DoItYourself type rather than the average Joe. I bought it thinking that it would be easy to manage if I also bought an automatic hose rewind (see below) to operate the hose with, but the hose rewind wheel could only accomodate about 75 feet of the 100 foot 5/8"" hose.Suncast PW100 Powerwind 100-Foot Capacity Automatic Rewind Garden Hose Reel"
3,not a fan,"Heavy duty but hose will not coil on the rack, it's too stiff. I have had other commerical hose I liked better that coil neatly. Think this hose will get replaced next spring with something better."
2,Bad customer service and bad hose connection,We purchased this hose for our new house. The connection to the water outlet leaked. We called the company and they said since it was brand new they would send us a new hose. Never got new hose. They said normally they would ask us to cut off the connection and send it but since it was new that was not a problem.This hose is very stiff.
3,Nice...but dangerous,"Fabulous looks will get you anywhere, but behind the scenes could be damaging effects.I have been looking for a garden hose that did not contain 'Microban', a algae and fungus retardant. The product desription for this hose did not mention chemically treated.Upon opening the wrapper I see the dreadful WARNING: THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS ONE OR MORE CHEMICALS KNOWN TO THE ST OF CALIFORNIA TO CAUSE CANCER AND BIRTH DEFECTS.So now we have hoses that you shouldn't really hold with your bare hands or allow children to play with.This a big industrial hose, not really for backyard gardening."
3,I hate hoses... still.,"I bought this hose to replace the stiff green monsters that are so difficult to drag around the yard and even harder to reel up and put away. This one is very pliable - so much so that it constantly kinks and shuts off water flow. I'm watering my potted plants daily here in north Texas, and just leave this hose dumped on the lawn every day. To reel it in means to spend half an hour the next day unkinking it. I gave this item three stars because it does actually deliver water to my plants, as it was designed to do. But it has done nothing to change my opinion. I still hate hoses."
5,"Oh, so this is his musical vocabulary!","As a musician I naturally focus on the musical elements of music. (The last thing I listen to is the lyric!) I heard Stevie Wonder play ""Alfie"" (of all things!) on his chromatica harmonica in concert at Madison Square Garden. Let me tell you...it moved me. Has anyone else noticed that his piano playing, his harmonica work, his moog bass and lead work, and even his rudimentary drumming is germane to his music? His harmonic inventiveness is amazing. Someone else mentioned Stevie's use of transposition to heighten the musical drama. His chord work is frankly amazing, especially relative to what else is out there. Is he really a self-taught musician? That voice! How he does those melissmas is incredible. Did you notice that virtuosic melissmatic duet passage in the opener? The fact is: 28 years into our marriage that song, ""You Are the Sunshine of My Life"" still gets it going for us!He's the best."
3,I WAANT 1976 STEVIE BAAACK!,"DONT GET ME WRONG, I LOVE STEVIE WONDER! HE IS A BEAUTIFUL HUMAN BEING & I HAVE ALMOST ALL OF HIS RECORDS, BUT I ONLY FELT 4 TRACKS OF ""A TIME TO LOVE"". ""SWEETEST SOMEBODY I KNOW"" IS THE CLOSEST THING TO THE OLD STEVIE WONDER ON THIS RECORD, BUT ""SO WHAT THE FUSS"" IS AS FUNKY AS A FUNKADELIC TRACK AND THE WORDS HIT HOME, & ""FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART"" WAS BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN. (STEVIE STILL PLAYS THE BEST HARMONICA IN R&B!) I MISS THE REAL MOOG & ARP SYNTHESIZER SOUNDS, THE REAL FENDER RHODES & LIVE DRUM PLAYING THAT STEVIE USED TO DO, BUT IT'S STILL AN OK RECORD. I HAVE THIS CD MAINLY JUST TO SUPPORT ONE OF MY MUSICAL & SOCIAL WORK HEROES, BUT I STILL WANT OLD STEVIE BACK!"
1,The worst book-to-movie movie ever made!,"Do not bother with this movie--it is so bad, it defies description. Those who have given it anything more than one star (and the ""system"" won't let you give a movie NO stars--which is what this one deserves) obviously did not read the book. (Melanie Griffith can't act when she's type-cast, so how is she suppose to pull off a seductive Latina?) ORDER THE BOOK instead (the book rates FIVE stars!)"
2,either barely watchable or almost unwatchable,"adapted from a book that the main character and its author both got an overblown self-important, self-centered pump-up ego as large as a 4-wheel bigfoot pickup truck; those 4 biggest off-road rugged tires only made the truck itself on top look like a matchbox model from toys-r-us.both of the book and the film were among the worst i've ever encountered. tom wolfe is like tom clancy, both trying so hard to put their own images into their books, making their main characters to either become rich and famous celebrities or become the president of the united states. dream on, man, if that's your american dream."
3,the bonfire of the vanities,"I started reading the book & left it behind, so I bought the movie. ""Like they say,...The book is always better""."
4,Much better than I expected,"I enjoyed this movie much better than I expected given all the negative reviews it received when released. I bought the video because I just finished reading the book and I actually liked the movie better overall than the book, which rarely happens. True, the book had more depth and nuance in the characters but it was too long and and the ending was terrible. The movie held together much better. Also, I was skeptical about Tom Hanks in the lead role but he was actually very good. I say, keep an open mind, try the film, and you'll be pleasantly surprised."
2,some movie.,"this movie is pretty dull and a good example of a bad film adaptation of a kind of okay book. sometimes it's laughable when it's not supposed to be, hahaha!! i laughed."
3,Teaches General Ideas behind some selected openings,"This is not really a book on ""How to Win in the Chess Openings"" as the title says. It is a book that covers ideas behind some selected openings. You should not plan to ""force"" a win in the opening, but to be prepared for tactics at all parts of the game. But, to best be prepared for Tactics in the Opening you should be looking at a book on Opening Traps (there are a couple good ones published).This book, which is not up to date on the openings, is written in the old form of Descriptive Chess Notation - these should be fixed by an updated version. I personally like ""Understanding the Chess Openings"" by Collins far better as a general book on the openings since it covers a lot more material and is up to date. I feel Collins book and an opening traps book together is the most ideal way for someone just starting out learning openings to get started."
4,Swine Husband,"Unforgetable. Portrayal of an abusive, ungrateful spouse and long suffering wife. Love to see this fellow get his comeuppance. Great acting."
1,incomplete,"The film cut off three chapters before the films ending. My mother, who received it as a Christmas present, was very upset."
5,Brilliant film - the cinematography is breathtaking!!,The Color Purple is the best film I have ever seen and I have watched thousands of films. The cinematography is breathtaking and the story is so real and painful that you feel what the characters are going through. This film is simply flawless. There is absolutlely nothing that could improve it. It's perfect!!!!!
1,The Color Purple,"In detail, i would not of bought it if i would have known that the case was broke, therefore i can not play or rewind it. Also contacted the sender and there response to me was ( sorry i don't know what to tell you.)"
5,"...hands down, what movies should be about...","...this is like goin to see my people down the way... i know these [people]!very insightful, because i can identify with the reasons and methods behind every character here. very seldom does EVERY character in a movie have a story to tell, but they do here; this movie could have centered around any character and still been an excellent story!!! alice walker and steven spielberg did great jobs with this, as well as the cast of actors. one of the top five of all american movies."
1,half of the movie,I love this moving but I ordered it from Amazon and only half of the movie is on the disc.
5,An all-around masterpiece,"It's one of those cases where you have to struggle to find if there are any flaws in a movie, even after repeat viewing. Incredible photography, stunning performances, a story that will not leave you untouched. The transfer quality on the DVD is very good. If you are looking for a classic movie for your library, you don't have to look any further."
4,Great Movie!..Bad DVD!,"When I purchased my DVD system,this was one of the first movies that I ran out and bought. It is a classic,..I have view it at least once a year on VHS. Now that I own it on DVD,...I was very surprised to find out that I had to flip the disc over to finish this great movie. Warner Brothers!...what a bummer. I give the movie 5 stars,...but I take away one because of the hassle of turning over the movie right where Celi kisses Shug. Bad DVD."
2,fake snow,"The snow is fake, so is much of the rest of this commercial production. But what else would you expect, Hollywood knows what people want, and they love it. I guess everything is an abstraction from reality, and since the book isn't reality, what difference does it make? I just prefer my cinema a few degrees more removed from DisneyWorld."
4,Grandma's View,"These chairs are so beautiful. The seat size is a little small, but the leather covering is nice. we bought 4 bar stools and one package was missing some vital bolts (FYI) We went to the hardware store and found comparable bolts."
3,"Very good stool, but false advertising (height)","This is a very good that was better than expected for the price. Also easy to assemble. My only problem is that it is taller than the listed height of 30 inches. The stool is actually 32 inches high. I had to cut the legs myself in order to fit my desired height. In my opinion, I call this ""false advertising"", and it is the reason I am limiting my review to only three stars only. Also, I am not sure of its long term durability, especially the arms. Having said that, I like the stool enough to order a few more for my kitchen!"
1,Stools ending with an S,"Please don't assume that the description ""stools"" indicates that there is more then 1 stool,,,,,,rest assured it's just one stool"
1,Bad Customer Service,"I ordered the barstools thinking they would be perfect for my counter; however, I could hardly get up in the chairs because they were so tall. They are charging me a 20% restocking fee! I bought 3 of these chairs, so you can do the math. I think it is completely ridiculous that they charge 20%. It is hard to judge something by a picture. Will definitely NEVER buy from this company again. RUDE!"
2,You get what you pay for,"The hole for water is impossible to get water in, without a funnel or similar. It uses a cloth wick, and how that gets the dirt wet enough is beyond me. It just doesn't seem to work. In essence, this is just a normal pot with an overflow reservoir. You'd be better off paying a little more to get another brand."
5,Love it,"Have had one for almost two years. Works better than good. I Put some chicken in it to thaw for a BBQ and closed the lid. Three days later they were still frozen solid. Good luck the BBQ got delayed for another three days. Even then I had to take them out of the cooler to get them thawed so we could use them. Drinks and ice stayed chilled and frozen at another family outing. I'm getting one for larger family to use and keep mine safe from ""borrowers""."
1,Latches guaranteed to break,"I am not hard on my things, but the latches on the original cooler (and also the replacement latches) both lasted only about a month of full time use. Maybe because of the desert heat? Whatever, I think that the life span should be measured in years, not in months or even weeks. My previous cooler was still working fine after many years when I got a bigger one. I think they switched to cheaper parts.If you do buy this cooler and your latches also break consider replacing with metal latches. I know Igloo sells them though you may need to go to the Igloo site to find them. That's going to be my next attempt. I've got about as much invested now in latches as I did in the original cooler."
3,Awsome Movie...horrible DVD,"This is one of the greatest movies ever made. I used to watch this movie over and over again when I taped it off of HBO back in the day. The acting is great as is the cinematography and direction. You really get a good feel for all of the characters.The bad thing is the DVD. This DVD for one does not have any worthwhile Special Features besides a couple of trailers, a couple of actor bio's and a few Production Notes. Where's the directors commentary? Where is the behind the scenes footage? I hope that perhaps they are planning on releasing a Specail Edition because this DVD does not do it justice. Also halfway through the movies you have to get up and flip it over to the other side. What up with that?You could by the VHS for cheaper and not miss out on anything special.As a movies its great, as a DVD I give it 1 star.Here's hoping they come out with a better DVD version."
3,"Fine Movie, Bad DVD","The movie itself is fine - I'm not reviewing that. This is more of a WARNING that you have to FLIP THE DISC OVER after the first hour! Old-school DVD. Gimme a break. Got this as a gift, glad to finally watch it, suddenly after an hour it stops and I had to actually get up and turn the disc over. Come on. PLEASE re-release this using current technology. Having to flip it is seriously enough of a ""defect"" to make me not want to watch it ever again...."
4,Goodfellas,A Classisic every home should have this movie in their home movie libraryGoodfellas (20th Anniversary Edition) [Blu-ray]
5,The best mafia movie out there,"This is one of the most amazing films I've ever seen. It has drama, makes you want to keep watching, gruesome scenes of mafia ""hits"", and loads of profanity. ""what am I, a f***ing clown? Here for your f***ing amusment?"" Ah, Joe Pesci was the best. Too bad they whacked him-errr, i mean.... Joe Pesci lives. Anyhoo, buy this movie, stock up on food, watch it, watch it again, keep watching it, don't go outside for a month, keep watching it, and, oh, did I mention you should watch it?"
1,Bad quality,The quality sucked on this movie. Worse than a bootleg. Don't buy this product but spend the extra few bucks and get the real thing at best buy
4,The Ultimate Mob Movie!!,"This is one of my favorite mob movies of all-time. The acting is great, as well as the direction. Martin Scorsece is a genius! As for the blu-ray release of this movie, I find that the picture and sound have greatly improved from the DVD version. It's also nice to not have to flip the disc over to finish watching the movie. I would definitely recommend this release to any new or old fans of the movie. Enjoy!"
1,"1 star for the DVD, 5 stars for the movie","Goodfellas is my all-time favorite movie. I could go on and on for days about all of the things that make this movie great. However, the DVD is a disgrace. You actually have to get up in the middle of it and flip it over to watch the rest of the movie! What is that ....?! That is what VHS is for. I was not so bothered by the lack of extra features as I was by this. I would recommend NOT buying Goodfellas on DVD until it is rereleased with it all on one DVD and maybe some extra footage and stuff with it. Geez, you would think a movie of this magnitude would have had more thought put into the DVD."
5,Reminds me of someone we know (punctuated by laughter),"This is absolutely one of my favorite films. Even after repeated viewings. Strips wiseguy life of its veneer to expose the self-absorption, betrayal and fear at its coarse base.The dinner scene (the deer's hoof in the car's grill is deemed a sin by Tommy)has to be one of the most morbidly hilarious ever filmed."
5,Goodfellas=Realism.,"In 1990, I remember sitting in the theatre before 'Goodfellas' started and expecting nothing. Afterward, my friend and I looked at each other with a mutual surprised expression -- ""That was a great movie"" . Scorcese is an incredible storyteller and, 'Goodfellas', like 'The Sopranos', has received such critical acclaim b/c of the believability of the characters and the creative way it is presented. A lot of the dialogue in the film was adlibbed by the actors, more realism. Excellent film."
5,good freakin fellas,"this movie has a great cast of characters, such as robert deniro and joe pesci all actors/actresses did an ammzing performance. and its directed by martin scorsese, one of the Best directors of all time."
4,should've been 5 stars,"this is a great movie for any gangster flick fan! it has the lot, humour, violence,and a great story with excellent dialogue. a must see! i would have given it 5 stars if the disc hadn't been a ""flipper"" the last thing you want to do have way through a movie is get up and turn the disc, i expect more from warner brothers."
2,Scumbags,Who cares about any of these people? They could all die and it wouldn't make a difference to me.
3,Nothing New Here - Aside From The Packaging,"This disappointing ""20th Anniversary Edition"" is nothing more than the exact-same previously released Blu-ray packaged with a DVD that was part of another previously released gangster-themed set from Warners.In other words, aside from the digi-book pacakaging there is absoloutely nothing new here.The most annoying thing about this release is that Warners didn't confirm that this was simply repackaging of previously released discs until very late in the process. In other words, hoping that many (like me!) would sell off their old copies and order this new one.Well, you know what they say Warners...fool me once...With all that said, the Blu-ray version is a solid transfer, and I don't have to tell most of you how great the film is. Assuming you don't already own the prior release, this is a worthy addition to your shelf. Otherwise, it's a definite pass."
5,Perfection,"What is there to say about a movie that was meant to be. Great acting, one liners, history, music, originality, and Martin Scorsese. The best mob movie in a class all by itself. Joe Pesci is top notch and the Robert DeNiro is seriously in to his role that makes for a believable piece of work. The first release of this movie on DVD was a flipper. You know some on side 1 and some on side 2. This special edition has it all on one side and a bonus disc to boot. And oh what a bonus disc it is. I'm still wiping up the drool. A definate want for movie collectors. Even if you do get bored someday of the film if this is at all possible, try counting the ""F"" words. That'll keep you busy."
3,WHY THE WORLD WONDERS AT AND IS REVOLTED BY US CULTURE,"this film dissects for all the world to see the profound immorality and greediness of American life. The mob stands as sign and symbol for American capitalist corporate life.Under the guise of a nostalgic loving examination of New York's organized crime scene, the director of the Last Temptation of Christ rips open for our examination the inferno which our civilization became and the immoral base upon which it thrived. It is difficult to see any hope for such an empire based upon betrayal, drugs, violence and greed. Scorcese presents the pits of sin as clearly as Dante's Inferno, and runs them through to there logical conclusions in death and destruction. May we learn from this morality play before it grows far too late. Let us ask what we may do for our country."
2,Garbage!,"I cannot fathom why Warner made this DVD a single layer. The days of having to get up and flip the laser disc are over. I cringed when I saw ""Side A"" ""Side B"" on the DVD. I still may return it. That and there is next to nothing extra with the DVD. No commentary, no deleted scenes, no documentary. Garbage."
3,also gift,"I cant write a review of a gift, I dont know if it played,skipped, was awful....I know it was a gift"
5,Best mob film!,What can I say that hasn't been said? Ray Liotta was brilliant at his part portraying Henry Hill. this will be in my collection forever.
4,"Great movie, average DVD","Quite simply one of the best movies of all time. However this DVD production does nothing to enhance that. If I were rating the movie alone, 5 stars no question, if I were rating this DVD, what extras it has, and the quality of the packaging, 3 stars at best."
1,CAN A FILM BE ANYMORE OF A WASTE?,"Too f**king long!! If I knew how the film ended, I might have given a darn about what was going on, but even the ending is mundane."
1,BAD Recording,This was a real disappointment. The movie plays halfway through then stops. To watch the rest of the movie you have to turn the CD over.A waste of money!
1,Terrible,This is the worst DVD I own. Goodfellas is my favorite film and to see it get such shabby treatment on DVD is appalling. The interactive scene menu is incomplete. You have to flip the disc to see the second half of the movie. Do not buy this DVD. Buy the letterbox VHS version.
2,the worst of the (modern) Pride events,"Clearly my opinion differs from the other reviewers, when I saw the average review for this event I felt the need to contribute.First: this event is included in Pride Legacy volume 4 (that has 5 events), so if you want to see this event at all, at least get it with four better events thrown in:Pride Fighting Championships: Pride Fighting Legacy, Vol. 4Second: this was the most boring card in execution. The announcers repeatedly apologized during Horn/Yvel for the fight being boring. Fedor made his debut here against an impressive opponent, but the fight was far from stellar. Probably his least captivating performance. The announcers stated that they hoped the main event made up for the rest of the card. It was a sloppy, entertaining slugfest, but to me couldn't make up for the rest of what I'd sat through."
1,Tepid attempt...,"With a great cast, a storyline that could have been developed into something of more interest (and which could have permitted its protagonists to show their true acting potential), and based on a book that was rather captivating, it is quite surprising that this movie was such a disappointment. The way in which it was edited (from the very beginning, when it takes nearly five minutes for any of the characters to speak one word or do anything of importance --while a piece of pseudo-mysterious classical music plays in the background) gives it a TV movie feel that lasts through the very end. The sudden and predictable denouement takes place after over an hour and a half of no character development and absolute movie boredom; even Meryl Streep's amazing acting qualities do nothing to rescue this tepid excuse for a film. Not worth buying, only worth watching on a boring Sunday afternoon when there's nothing else on the other 157 channels."
2,didn't like the flavor,"Web vitamins is great to do business with. They have super speedy shipping and great customer service.Having said that, I thought the rootbeer flavored stevia was awful.Loved the grape, orange, vanilla and lemon, but not this one or the chocolate."
1,disappointed,I was really excited to find this product but was disappointed in the results. I used it to sweeten some carbonated soda and the first sip was great. Every sip after that had less and less root beer flavor and more and more of the artificial sweetener/alcohol taste. So now I'm looking for another root beer extract to try!
1,Room for improvement,"Ok ,I was very excited when I thought I could enjoy the flavor of root beer without calories or worrying about the effects of aspartame...well I was pretty disappointed in this.It does have a slight root beer flavor, but I wouls highly recommend using a whole dropper (or more) to a glass instead of the 6-8 drops suggested.Also I would suggest to the manufacturer to not only enhance the flavor but to also add some natural color to make it APPEAR to LOOK like real root beer.I think this was a great idea but needs to be tweaked more.Also use seltzer water instead of plain water otherwise it will be like drinking flat weak root beer."
5,Good purchase,"I shopped around for a long time for just the right set of flatware and found this set. Comfortable weight, appearance, size of utinsel, and nice ""shine"" are some of the reasons why I don't regret for one minute making this purchase. I love the size of the large forks, and the price was right. The storage caddy is strong and nice-looking in our drawer."
5,New Literacies in Action,"I recently attended a workshop at which William Kist was a presenter. I was intrigued by his thoughts on alternative literacies, so I bought this book. I have not been disappointed. Dr. Kist has been very thorough in his research, and his ideas are revolutionary in their simplicity. William Kist's prescriptions for using multi--media techniques in literacy education are perfect for students of all abilities. I have already begun to implement some new literacy projects in my own classroom, and I am thrilled with the excitement that the students are exhibiting toward the art of language. This book is an important addition to any instructor's library. I recommend it very highly."
4,Surprise! This Is A Pretty Good Movie!,"Reading most of the reviewers who have a marginal opinion of ""Shanghai Surprise"" they give it damning faint praise by saying it's not as bad as its reputation suggests. Man up and admit it's a pretty good movie. The critics in its day made hay of the film saving their worst venom for Madonna. She's not going to win any Oscars for her turn as a missionary in Thirties China but she gives a very sweet account of herself in only her second feature role. Sean Penn as the American opportunist/glow-in-the-dark tie salesman is quite charismatic and dashing. The story is relatively riveting and the film contains stunning exotic period detail. Lastly, producer George Harrison, who also appears in a nightclub scene, contributes some terrific songs to the soundtrack. I give this film my unequivocal recommedation with very few reservations."
3,A Classic in a So-So Edition,"After returning to my tattered paperback copy for a third reading, I decided it was time to get a nice hardback copy, and purchased the Brassey's. While solidly constructed, this edition was lazily produced. The jacket promises ""...Dozens of Rare German Photographs"" which are largely forgettable, in often murky reproductions (maybe from equally murky originals, in which case they shouldn't have been selected), and with generally unhelpful captions. I would have preferred more interesting public domain shots. And no maps! Just one, to help the reader trace Sajer's journey, would have been useful. A great book which should have been better served."
5,"Very moving, as provoking as Frankls Search for Meaning","Fantastic book and despite the one negative review from the gentleman from Canada...(The world has it's nit pickers who seek importance from irrelevant inaccuracies) This book drills to the core of suffering and our relations to each other during extreme duress... May we never know the suffering of this time again. And a great gift to that someone on your list that needs a heavy dose of ""Gee I guess I don't have it so bad after all"". It has the power to change lives to the better.."
3,Should be under fiction,"After reading Mr. Sajers book, I had serious doubts about his recollections. I have read many war related biographies over the years, and find that unless the author took copious notes during or immediately after the events, they remembered only bits and pieces of conversations, etc. Mr. Sajer seemed to have no problem recalling pages of dialogue with the greatest detail under the most extreme circumstances years later. As far as being entertained by the book, it was interesting reading as long as you take with a grain of salt."
2,Valuable As History But Not A Great Book,"This detailed account of the brutal German-Russian war lacksthe moral qualities required, even when the subject is war,to be a great book. In chapter 3 Sajer writes that he wasfighting for a ""good cause"". Yeah right - if you define agood cause as a murderous racist regime that invades othercountries! It's strange to me that so few readers aredisturbed by Sajer's lack of admission of wrong-doing.Sajer frequently boasts in the book that the German armywould have prevailed if only they didn't face superiornumerical odds in Russia. He has the attitude that a lotof Confederate veterans had in writing about the civil war.Bitter about the suffering he experienced and making excusesfor defeat, while showing almost no contrition for the sufferinghe imposed."
4,A chilling first-hand account of the Eastern Front,I found this book chilling in many respects. It is not well written in the conventional sense and yet it portrays reality in a battlefield as only a first hand account can.Of the many WW2 books I have read this book is the only one that makes you sit and think.
5,The best book about war and what its like to serve!,"Without a doubt this book exemplifies what it is to be in a military unit under the most extreme conditions. It reminds those who have served their countries what it was like to have friendships forged during those conditions. For those who have never served their countries, it spells out the pain and folly of war - that any veteran can see. This book is one of the two books best suited to the task of teaching us, the easy way, that war is folly - the other is ""All Quiet on the Western Front"
4,Fact or Fiction? Autobiographical or not-so-simple story telling?,"This exquisitically detailed and greatly ovewritten account of a German infantryman's travails on the Eastern front from the winter of 1943 until the end of the war has generated a lot of conroversy. Is it a novel or is it autobiography? Fact is that once you finish the 465 pages of cold, hunger, despair, fatigue, unspeakable terror and blood and body parts - if you do - I think you will decide as I did that it is both. On the one hand Guy Sajer is or was a real person and was really there; and he tells it like it was. On the other no one writing in 1967 is capable of telling these experiences in the minute detail Sajer does. Memory is simply not that perfect. So memory is embroidered and in some cses recast. It's a good book, though. Real and lots of purple prose which badly needed the the firm hand of a good editor."
3,Few details,"It wasn't what I expected. I couldn't stop reading it, but I was more interested in a history book not a war novel."
1,lousy novel,"This a lousy novel and absolute fabrication. Anyone who knows anything about the German Army knows the GD Division was nowhere near Konotop in the fall of 43. The Hitler Youth didn't fight at Kursk. There was no such thing as Rollbahn units. No B-17s attacked Berlin in 43. Get your facts straight. Lousy history, lousy novel."
3,A Bit Disappointed,"This book did not move me as I had expected, based on the reviews I had read. Yes, it was interesting in that it was written by a grunt on what was the most vicious part of WWII. However, it reads like a novel, with Sajer taking a lot of liberties in terms of specific dialogues that make up a big part of the book. The book lost some credibility with me because of this. Perhaps I was not as swept away by this book after having recently experienced a true ""work of soul"" (Saving Private Ryan), and having read a gritty book that was much more fact-based (A Blood-Dimmed Tide--Battle of the Bulge) right before having read Sajer."
5,The Best I have every read,"This book is just incredibly powerful. I read it about 10 years ago as another reviewer did and I have never forgotten it. This book, more than dozens of others I have read on various wars by the brave people who fought them communicates the true horror and terror of combat. His description of being under artilary bombardment and how helpless and at the mercy of good luck one is in such a situation is branded into my mind. I could not recommend a book more stongly than this one. You won't be able to put it down and it will leave you shell shocked yourself from the read."
1,Most Lame Movie of the 90's,"I can't believe someone told me to watch this movie. The acting is on par with grabbing a camera and telling your 3 best friends (who can't act) to start talking ""police movie talk"". Your friend would say, ""Come on guys, the Commish has been on my back over the apartment building blowing up and those cops getting killed. Let's find out who did this. We owe it to society!"" It's also completely unrealistic. Nothing that the cops or criminals do makes sense. It's so bad, I had to write a review."
4,new jack city,"WOW,this movie was the first part of American Ganster.All the actors played their parts very well."
3,Don't think so,"all i can say is that is has a good story line but reall poor acting, it's not that exciting. It is not worth buying and if you are eager to see it...rent the video"
4,I recommend it!,"If you are looking a film that seeks to solve the mysteries of the universe - this ain't it! What it is is a great western staring the Duke. the story line is similar to El Dorado and Rio Lobo - John Wayne, a rag tag group of misfits, and a hilarious old coot take on the bad guys - an learn'm a thing or two! This is a keeper!"
4,Good Movie,"Good movie with Dean Martin, Rick Nelson, Walter Brennan and of course The Duke. Forget the story line it was good, but the singing with Dean, Rick and Walter was just great to me. Did I fail to mention Angie Dickinson, though she has had better acting roles, she was as pretty as ever and this may have been one of her earliest movies though not sure about that. If amaz could learn how to deliver their movies with out it stopping and pausing every five minutes it would have been even better"
2,A Hollywood Western,"Rio Bravo had the potential to be a great western, but the studio moguls had other ideas...like making money at the box office. What else could justify the casting of lightweights Dean Martin and Ricky Nelson? I suppose with the breakup, Jerry Lewis wasn't available to play Colorado. The song near the end of the film didn't help matters either. How could John Wayne criticize High Noon and then make this kind of fluff? This is not The Searchers (perhaps the definitive John Wayne film), but even as a light hearted western, it's about two hours too long. The Duke has the sissy walk down and Angie Dickinson is not hard to look at, but Walter Brennan is the only gem in this clinker."
1,Not Blu Ray,"I thought blu ray was supposed to be of a certain high quality. This blu ray disc is not. I have the dvd & the blu ray, you cannot tell any difference. Good thing it was only $10. If the older movies cannot be brought up to true blu ray quality they should not be able to advertise them as such."
2,NOT HD,"This is a review of the disc, not the movie.I think we all know the story, Rio Bravo IS a GREAT movie, the re-mastering is AWFUL.There is nothing HD about this disc.It may have been re-mastered in 1080p, but it loks awful.I have seen this movie on Netflix thru my Roku & the dvd is no better.I have seen El Dorado on Dish (saved it on the DVR) & it looks OUTSTANDING.Really disappointed with this disc.Good thing it was only $10.49, I guess you get what you pay for."
4,My favorite movie,"I have seen this movie too many times to count. No clue why. Key players gave great performances. Dean Martin was superb, John Wayne pure John Wayne, and Walter Brennan was wonderful. Pretty obvious that Walter Brennan made Dean Martin crack up in their scenes. Rickey Nelson was a kid when this was made and is showed but he was serviceable. Angie Dickenson looks great and gave a decent performance given her age at the time. Supporting cast well chosen and gave excellent performances. Classic good vs evil with some chuckles tossed in.Blu Ray quality on this was good. Sharp video. Audio was also good to a great score. Overall I am very satisfied. I had the DVD, but this is my all time favorite so I had to get the Blu Ray."
4,Lets go Motorhoming,This unit was for my water heater in my motorhome. It got us back on the road. Shipping was timely and the unit performs as listed. Good Amazon experience.
5,Enchanting retro-futurism...,"I bought this album the day after I saw Broadcast play a stunning gig in my town. There is a haunting, dreamlike quality to this music. The pure, almost anaemic vocals and the melodies remind me of Franoise Hardy and other European 60s popmusic, but original arrangements and the use of retro keyboards, Martian bleeps and various other electronic trickery make it all very contemporary. This is gorgeous music, especially if you're into old SF-movies, because this is the aural equivalent..."
2,Worst St Matthew cover - ever!,"Who was it that decided that the most-appropriate cover art for this CD was a picture of Bernstein holding a smoldering cigarette?Sorta disgusting, especially when you realize the cigs eventually killed him."
2,"Good idea, but...","I was really psyched to get a reasonably priced NAS system but have had quite a few problems with it on my home network. Main problem is speed. It is attached by ethernet cable to my linksys router, as well as one of my laptops (XP). Even from that PC, access to files on the EFG80 is quite slow. And it becomes basically unusable when I try to access files from other laptops that are on my wireless LAN. Which of course completely defeats the purpose of a network-attached storage system.Not sure what the problem is. I have two drives installed, with one drive mirroring the other. Maybe that's causing the unacceptable performance."
1,Two's Enough Three's a Crowd,"I had to write a review about this book...I had to order her books because they didnt have them in the book stores and now I see why...I have never in my life read a book that I wanted to jump through the book to slap the charcaters...I thought the book was stupid and the chapters were way too long...[...]...she made these women out to be weak, stupid and desperate...if they were so beautiful and smart and had it going on, why have them putting up with that mess for years on end...this was the 2nd book I read from her, the first was(by best friends man) and you best believe I wont be torturing my self by buying and reading another one by her...I thought I would give her a chance seeing that she was a New Black Female Author but I was sadly disappointed in both of her books...I dont know which one made me the most Sick...If there was an email address to write to her directly I would...Dont quite your day job Brenda..."
1,Wrong charger for A930,"Despite the product title here and the label on the package that clearly reads ""3 Piece Starter Kit for Samsung A930,"" the cigarette lighter adapter in this product does not fit the A930. It has the wrong type of connector. I compared it to a Samsung OEM vehicle charger for this model (which my wife had) that does fit the A930, and the adapter connector in this kit is longer and wider. I'm not certain if this is a case of the wrong charger occasionally being put into these Starter Kits by the manufacturer, or a case of the kits being mislabelled, but in either case, I'd beware. Amazon, thankfully, has a good return policy."
4,Great Beach Read,"I took this book on vacation to Jamaica! The characters are interesting because we don't learn all about them, just enough to know there is more than meets the eye. Not a book that will tax your mind but very enjoyable for what it is."
3,Entertaining flick,"I rented this because I just read and reviewed the book which was excellent, and perhaps that's why the three star rating. It's very hard to capture the ""between the lines"" and subtext going on in the movie, although I will say they got a lot of the lines just right, taken in some cases verbatim and as imagined from the book.The problem, of course, is that Turow's writing is very indepth and that just can't be captured on film, and since the movie and story are not much of a ""fast-paced"" action thriller, I believe it fell short a bit.It's still worth seeing, read the book if you can, but I'd hesitate to recommend this as a library item, only because it's not something you can really watch over and over, it's too slow and once you know the twists, what'd be the point?"
5,Cold Shower Egypt!,"Hey last night I met a girl she was so wild! How wild was she! She was so wild I gave her a virgin wool sweater...her body rejected it! This and many other comical pieces in MEET WALLY SPARKS make it a well-rounded film. Cameos by such famous people as Ron Jeremy and Tony Danza (playing a Taxi driver) make this film a must-see.A line in the scene with Tony when Wally gets in his cab: Tony: Hey wait till I tell the boys I had you in my cab! Wally: Hey Tony first of all you never had me, and if you did have me it wouldn't be in a cab. Tony: Oh it kills me it kills me"
5,Rodney Dangerfield,"I love this movie. Had it on VHS and i'm in the process of purcessing them on dvd. This is hilarous!If you like Rodney, you will love this move. Great story line with lots of luaghs."
5,Dangerfield's over the top best film comedies yet!,"This time Rodney Dangerfield plays a trashy television gossip talk show host personality named Wally Sparks who gets some hot juicy scandal tabloid with a southern political governor who thinks an affair is going with his campaign manager in this dispute. My favorite scene stealer is when Dangerfield's dancing with the polticans wife and carries a broken statues missing penis in his front pants. Which I find so hilarious and still cracks me up in every part of this raunchy farce here.Like Rodney says ""I Get No Respect At All!""."
2,Warranty secret,"For those of you who don't know (and I am sure there are many of you, since it is unusually hard to find out): the warranty is ONLY 90 DAYS! Keep that in mind when the $150 get out of your wallet."
2,Inferior Palm,Don't bother with this one if you can get the Z22. This one is so inferior that I threw it away.
3,zire31,zire31-came WITHOUT A POWERCORD you can't use a 64bit computer with it.I had to wipe palmone software off my computer the hotsync got stuck in running blockingbeing able transfer data from notebook to handheld. I lost over 36hrs of data entering before I finally just manueLy intered my data onto the handheld.this device needs more progamming cleanup/correction by the makers of the product.NOT NOVICE USER FRIENDLY much less windows7 compatable
5,ZIRE 31,The PalmOne Zire 31 is everything I needed in a handheld and it works great. the PalmOne website is a P.O.S. though
3,"Some minor difficulties, but overall a good unit","I have been using low end Palm PDAs for the last five years. This translates into three models, the last one being the M100. This is my first color model. Strengths are very nice resolution and clarity, much better than the old black and white. Clarity suffers in bright sunlight. The screen is almost impossible to read in sunlight. Easy operation, nice layout of functions overall. I am not that crazy about Graffiti 2. For some reason, my machine is very finicky about making the letter K with G2. With time I find myself getting used to G2 however. The rechargable battery holds a charge for a decent period of time. The flip cover seems cheap and will probably wear out in a short period of time. Picture viewing is not terrific. I have not used the MP3 player."
1,it sucks,this pda is really bad and you shouldn't buy it. it doesn't even work everytime you turn it on. it is too expensive for how it performs.
1,Do not buy unless you plan to upgrade within a year,"I too bought the Palm Zire 31 in November 2004 from Amazon. Must have been a bad batch because it died a month ago. So lasted a month more than someone who bought in the same timeframe. The warranty is only 90 days. I should have known better since all our Palms (a total of 7 -- 2 treo 600, 1 zire, 3 Palm V, 1 Palm III) have died within 2 years of use; the Treos within 6 months-- I am on the replacement right now which is blinking 'death' too.I am so wedded to the Palm Desktop but may be forced to switch to Outlook. I am not a fancy or advanced user, just looking for something reliable. Sigh..."
1,This machine will just DIE on you...,"Like all the other reviewers, I was happy with my Zire 31 for the first four months of owning it...then one day it just did not turn on. I did a soft reset...nothing. Hard reset...came on for a moment, then again it DIED. Now it is worthless, I got 120 days of use. Warantee is for 90 days. Don't waste your money."
3,"OK, as far as it goes","I had a Cassiopeia first and it died, so I went with the Palm Zire 31. As a PDA, it's fine. It never worked out too well as an MP3 player, but the amount of available software is nicer than the Casio. I'm not jumping up and down about it, but it's serviceable and has been working for over 6 months for me. The screen is nice and clear..."
1,False Product Advertisement,"I bought a Zire 31 from Amazon in December. It arrived in a white card board box; which after disvcoering from Palmone was not the orignal packaging. Also, when I ran a serial checl on it through Palmone they said it comes up as a refurbished product with no warranty. Now I cannot get the product support or software I need to run it, because Palmone will not take responsibility. I have contacted every party involved and they all refuse to help. I don't know about everyone else but I paid the full price for this product (holding faith that I was getting what I bought) and feel that someone should be responsible. If you are buying this product buy it from a local retailer and not online. I do not reccomend buying from amazon."
5,GREAT FOR LONG DRIVES AND KIDS,"Easy enough to entertain even the most restless of kids. One can watch a movie while the other hooks up his game and plays that. I have two teenagers and an nine year old, and the teenagers are the worst when it comes to long drives. Thankfully this keeps them occupied until we reach our destination."
5,Fun for all ages,A definite 5-star fun rating with our 2- and 4-year old boys. They both ignore all the plastic and electronic junk from Christmas (except Legos) and play with this one every day for hours. It seems to be indestructable so far (it's the only thing besides Legos which isn't broken since Christmas). The only problem is that we only have one truck and they are constantly fighting with each other over whose turn it is to play.
3,Textbook,Not as detailed as I had hoped. It makes lots of references to see local rules and does not contain details that would be helpful in filing.
3,rain - foul weather gear,"Although not yet used as of this writing, as motorcycle rider, where this gear is purely for emergerncy use with being caught in the rain, looks fine. Like the light weight."
1,Save your $18.98,"Your better off with the money burning a whole in your pocket, this is generic swing, nothing special, no solos or anything..."
5,wonderfull,i do not have to write 1000 words to review this great artist.he is the best thing that ever happen to the great country of COLOMBIA.
2,Good book but really bad binding,This is a well written and quite interesting book but I stopped reading it about half way through as it was falling apart in my hands. Pages break off from the book in groups of 10-20 as soon as you're done reading. The publisher should spend a bit more on glue I guess.
5,Easy to read and understand,I love this book and I saw the author give a lecture on foratv.com under health. It's been a while since I purchased a book but I couldn't resist waiting to read this one. Highly recommended to read this book.
3,"Great Book, if you have a scientific background.","This author is obviously very knowledgeable and the subject matter is extremely interesting. I learned a lot about my baby's brain development and even why he behaves as he does sometimes (for example, why no separation anxiety when they are young, but then LOTS of separation anxiety when they are older - It is all biology!). Fascinating.BUT . . be warned that this is a very scientifically written book, almost like a medical textbook. Unless you are in the medical profession, you should read with a medical dictionary beside you. I missed a LOT of information because I do not have a science background.I wonder why the author did not include a Glossary at the back? It would have been very helpful."
3,baby feeder,"a very nice and helpful book. written in scientific format. includes what Im searching for. however, i still havent got enough time to finish it. very succesful!"
1,People bought this?,"I had a friend give me this book(thank God I did not pay for it)and it is real crap. People actually pay to read this? I am not sure who has the least intelligence; the author or the buyer... Wait I know; any one who paid to read it. I am glad this guy found a market to sell completely thoughtless nonsense to. I put this on the level of Brian Giffins, ""Wish it, Want it, Do it. I think The author literally set out to write the stupidest crap he could think of and see what would happen."
4,Historical reviews of famous family from a Bowen system view,McGoldrick examined many of the central concepts of Bowens systems theory and how these concepts are illustrated vividly from many historical families. The book offers a ethnographic lively application of family therapy concepts! It is a must read for students of family therapy.
2,Waste of money,"I have subscribed to AD a few times over the years, but got tired of the adds and looking at how the super wealthy lives and their homes. I love to look at decor magazines to get ideas, but in this there are none whatsoever. I also dislike their front cover showing some celebrity, I would rather have a picture of interior or house on it like they used to have. Unlike many others I couldn't care less about how the famous people lives. Veranda, Traditional Homes, Elle Decor & House Beautiful gives more ideas if you are into decorating, and I love these mags. It would still be nice if they came out with a decor magazine that ""average"" people can get ideas from as well, giving ideas on painting (colors) your home and affordable fabrics etc. Just my two-cents!"
1,Why pay just to read advertising?,"I was so disappointed in this magazine. It might be useful for you if you're looking for decorating ideas - and have an income of a few million bucks a year. Otherwise, it's mostly a collection of advertising, and glimpses into the homes of people who dress them up - rather than live in them. I'd defy you to find one real sign of life (say, a tube of toothpaste in a bathroom) in one single home featured in the zine.If you want to look at things that are out of reach, or you have a tremendous disposable income and want to bask in opulent conspicuous consumption, this might be just the publication for you.I was actually very relieved when the subscription ended, because I felt so bad about disposing of the polyethylene wrapper, and dropping all that high quality coated paper into the recycle bin upon arrival."
3,Mixed Bag,"I used to love Architectural Digest. I got to admire and be inspired by incredible homes, and I couldn't wait to get my issue every month.However, lately, I have seen less Architecture than Interior Design, and more ads than ever. I've even let my subscription lapse. Every now and again, I'll pick it up on the magazine rack, but only if the issue is architecture heavy, or covers a particularly interesting project in depth.Architectural Digest used to be the pinnacle in the field, but now it is just a mixed bag."
2,"Once about what you could have, but no longer...","Once upon a time, what you saw in AD was what you might one day be able to do yourself. It was about tasteful, even higher end, but it was obtainable. Now it's about the houses and interiors that even the more successful of us out there will never be able to attain. Please quit touring the houses of the celebrities, the rich and famous, and instead go back to the days of those who were once like the rest of us. In short, go back to when the stuff we saw in AD gave us ideas for our own dream houses. Now you are the tasteful ""home"" equivalent of People Magazine..."
2,catalog mag,I have subsribed to all the r/c mags for some time.This mag has become a glorified catalog for the adertizers.it used to be a real good mag once.
3,What Happened?,"I think that something happened to COC between Wiseblood (1996) and America's Volume Dealer (2000). I'm not sure what, though. This album isn't terrible. It's still got some good riffs, some good vocals, and generally some good music. Perhaps this just reflects my biased expectations, but to me this album seems too slow, too soft, and too disjointed. There's nothing wrong with being slow and soft, or even disjointed at times. Many people would use those three words for the instrumental interlude bits on ""Deliverance,"" but I actually liked those. On this album, though, there's just way too much of those qualities. There's a big difference between a cool instrumental bit for a minute, and a Load-like 45 minute rock album. I think the album before this (Wiseblood) and after (In the Arms of God) were both better than this one."
3,Iron Fist Good,"Iron Fist is a great, underused character - it's nice to see him get a figure, however, the flames for his hands do not fit properly and the bandana ends are glued to the side of his head in a very unrealistic way. Also, it would have been nice to have had holes in the feet to pose such a martial artist."
3,Not a lot that was new.,"Just OK book...much printed elsewhere in AFCC Journal, etc. I would have liked a group of experts suggesting what tests ought to be used in CCE's and why."
4,VERY GOOD ALBUM,"this album is awesome espacially the first 2 songs then all the songs look alike but all their rythm is great. If you like blink182, sum41, fenix tx and similar groups, you will love this one. If you like hard punk music, this is not for you, this is soft-middle punk music, which i love"
5,Awesome band!,"I think GC is about the best band out there. They are enough on the edge to really get you pumped up for the other hardcore punk stuff like Minor Threat and Rancid. I think you should definately buy this album. The first album introduces you to the band and allows you to see insight into their personal lives. The guys write from their own experiences, not some bull they made up. I recommend this CD. If you want more with a little more of a harder edge, then buy The Young and the Hopeless! This will definately get you pumped up and ready to go out or whatever!"
2,"Overrated band, overrated cd","I gave this cd 2 stars because I'm nice and I used to listen to this cd tons when it first came out in 2000 and until the whole GC wave hit everyone. But now I'm smarter and I don't listen to it anymore. For someone who can be pleased with simple music that anyone could write or somewhat sing, will like this cd. It is a fun cd but nothing more and now listening to it, it honestly isn't anything worth spending money on. What happened to poor GC? Stupid Avril...Anyways. enjoi"
1,B!+che5,"No-talent posers that sound so whimpy and watered down. Yeah, they like to dress like they're ""soooooo cool and bad"" (lol!), but their music is no different than any lame @55 Nsync or BSB album. Don't worry, GC will be tossed aside in a year or so, just like all the other trendy fads. ""The Young And The Hopeless"" is what their loser fans are. Morons. (I know a stupid chick that listens to this crap... and also has Hanson and Britney in her collection. 'nuff said.)"
1,who ever signed these guys should be shot....,"Good Charlotte has to be the most pathetic band i have ever seen. all they do is complain about stupid things like breaking up with there girlfriend or there mommy doesn't love them no more, stupid crap like that. the only decsent pop/punk band out there is new found glory, at least they dont complain about ever little thing. these guys r posers with nothing better todo except write gay music. for real music i suggestSTAINDNIRVANASTONE TEMPLE PILOTSBLACK SABBATHSOUNDGARDENAUDIOSLAVERAGE AGAINST THE MACHINEALICE IN CHAINSCHEVELLEAC/DCdo you get my point, theres so many different bands out there that can write music and sing very well. dont just listen to wat your friends think is cool. for once listen to REAL music and not this garabage."
5,GC rock,"i got into this cd becoz a friend of mine brought 2 it 2 skool + we were listening 2 them. i had neva heard of them b4 + he said they rocked + afta listening 2 the1st 2 songs me + 2 otha friends were like, 'BURN IT!!!'so now we've all got a copy + now it's constantly in my cd playa + it's one of my fav cd's - probably close 2 being my faveach song is totally original + the lyrics rock. the drumma's not that great but the singing makes up 4 ittrust me - this cd rocks"
2,Sort of a Jip,"Good Charlotte is a good band and everything, but do yourself a favor and buy the whole cd. The single gets old quickly and I'm sure there are other songs I could be enjoying, on the real cd. Basicly I am saying that they are so good, you all should just buy the real cd and leave the single to the more selective of the fans."
5,THE BEST CD I OWN!,"This is the BEST CD I have EVER bought in my entire life! It is just incredible! Every single song on it, is filled with the most catching beats and most meaningful lyrics!! These 5 guys know exactly what they are talking about!! The whole CD is just awesome! Check out ""The Little Things"", ""Change"", ""Complicated"", ""Thankyou Mom"" and MANY MANY more!! Even my mom likes them! The fact that they respect God and how they portray their youth, gives their songs so much more meaning! I recommend you all go buy this CD! For those of you who have it, you've done yourselves the biggest favor!! But for the ones who don't have it, have NO idea what they're missing out on!! So hurry over to the store and pick up this CD, but be careful, you might NEVER let it go!"
3,A nice attempt ...but not quite there,"The second cd is so much better. All things agreeed, overall, this CD isn't half as bad as ""Meteora"" by Linkin Park! Songs like ""The Click"", ""East Coast Anthem"" ""Little Things"" and ""Seasons"" had me yelling along to the chorus even though i don't live on the east coast, I live in the midwest! Buy this CD, you WILL NOT have wasted your money."
5,Good Charlotte... At It Again,"The new GC album is awesome. They rock. Joel's voice is so sexy and I can relate to alot of what the songs are talking about. Which is what music is for right, so it speaks to people. I don't care what anyone says about it, it is so awesome. Benji and Joel are adorable and crazy at the smae time. Gc- rocks. I am proud to be a fan. Rock on."
1,how can people rate this 5 stars?,"i hate good charlotte, they suck. i have no idea how these retards can be considered punk music. THIS IS POP CRAP FOR GOD SAKE!!!my freind told me one day that good charlotte wasnt cool. so i wasted 5 minutes killing my ears with this good charlotte crap seeing how it was. horrible! maybe all of you that think this stuff rocks are used to simple plan or other guys that call themselves 'punk' but im used to the REAL punk like Bad Religion. oh well some people like different things but lemme tell you this ain't punk. it sux"
1,This CD sucks ass,"Sorry to every dumb ass who thinks that good charlotte is a good band, but they aren't. In fact they are probably one of the worst bands that I have ever listened to. All that they care about is making a lot of money and looking like really hardcore punk rockers, while singing crapy songs about how much girls break their hearts. This is posbily the worst combination in music history. It is really sad to see what our society has come to, letting these no talent idiots make millions of dollars off of the brainwashed youth of America. If you don't want to be another conformist marching in a long line of greed and desparity then please don't listen to this junk."
5,goodcharlotte,"i have six simple words...THE BEST ALBUM I'VE EVER HEARD.every song on this CD rocks,every lyric meens somthing.there is'nt one single floor and not one bum track...(and there is 14 of them).the bad thing is this website only letting me give it 5 stars when it clearly merits at least 100...SHAME ON YOU."
5,Awsome!,"This cd rocks! My fav songs are East Coast Anthem and Seasons. Its a great cd overall. I wouldn't necessarily call it punk, but if it is, then i love punk. A must have."
2,yick,"I don't know why, but I cannot stand this CD. Maybe it's because it seems to me that every song sounds the same and so incredibly pop-punkish.....I would not recommend this if my life depended on it."
5,long time favorite,"Love this scent, used to wear it many many years ago, back when i was in high school, recently purchased it again, and still love it, I get many many compliments when i wear this scent."
4,Very good units but lacking QC process,"The cabinets are in very good size and appearance to fit our needs. But there is big crack on one of the doors when arriving which was not caused by delivery since packaging was not damaged. All the communications were smooth. The manufacturer sent replacement pretty fast. If they could do their QC better before shipping, we would all save time and cost."
5,AWSOME!!!!!!!!!!,"This game is AWSOME!I think it is the best expansion pack to The Sims that i have played.You can buy cats,dogs,iguanas,birds,parrots,turtles,and fish.It is truly a great game, and is worth your money."
3,"addictive as expected, but always crashing","This expasnion pack was always crashing on me. There is just so much data in this game.It's fun no doubt, but the pets are hard to manage. Having to control pets is hard along with people and it's awful when they die!The petstores are cute but repetitive. It's a cute idea, but hard to work with. I just like the extra furniture and skins.I wish I could play it, it just always crashes on me."
5,My faith is restored,"They lost me with Vacation. I strongly disliked that expansion pack. But, they did a really nice job with this one. It is a bit buggy (try placing a sim in the shower before you add the expansion pack!). I have only had the game for a couple of days, but I am hooked. Adding a pet to the mix gives my sims something else to do and someone to take care of. My cat runs to greet his ""master"" when she gets home. I think this pack brought us back to the original thought behind the sims - running a neighborhood and building up the lives of families - and I for one am thankful for it!"
2,"really, this game could be better","The Sims is an okay game and gets too much credit. All the expansions only add more job options and items (which you can easily download on the internet) for [money]!!Why spend so much money on an expansion...all it adds are pets or dating or a grim reaper or the option to make parties. All the expansions are dreadfully similar.why not add more than just one more option each time?!! i mean, for crying out loud...Pets? just pets? and more neighborhoods..wow.The variety of pets is not great, too...I'm disappointed"
2,well. its sorta ok,"the sims is an over rated game, i could only play it for a week or two before i got sick of it and stopped. its a good concept however and it would be nice to see a fp feature or somehting that makes it sligtly more interesting. or how bout this maxis, a halloween expansion pack, new deaths, hazards, rabid animals. the game is boring, spice it up."
5,My Thinking,"When I bought The Sims Vacation I didn't enjoy it very much. And when I saw this one, I almost knew it would be worse. But, I decided to buy it anyway... hey, what's there to lose other than money? Then when I began to play it I became intrested and also I had quite a bit of fun with it. Overall, I would reccomed this game, but the only problem is that when you buy a pet, you can't controll it... in other words the pets have a mind of their own."
4,"Fun, adorable, and yet annoying....","I find that this a great expansion pack and the best that they've come out with. It is alot of fun to play with the animals and they aren't too hard to take care of (maitenance wise)once you get the jist of things. The biggest problem is that things people may have downloaded for vacation and hot date don't show up! (This is for clothing though) If you downloaded pajamas etc. and they aren't named properly, you won't be able to buy them in the store. I overall reccommend this expansion pack for the person looking for a new twist to the fabulous game, The Sims."
2,Fun in some ways,"I got this game for Xmas, since I have nearly all execpt Vacation. The new jobs are a plus and the items, yet the friendship factor for advancing is hard. I can get to level 4 and than need more friends, which is always harder since they added this new bar of relationsip below the orginal. ... I must agree with the racoon problem that others have stated, it is annoying. I love cats and dogs, it get's me a little yucky though when a male or female talks cutey to a stray dog having it roll to get a belly rub.Walls, floors and such are better, you can use some of the downtown art obects in your own yard. What Maxis needs to do is add alot more jobs to choose from. Sims need to get older and get other illnesses than the gueina pig one, maybe like cancer or something. Weather should also influence a Sim's life; tornadoes, blizzards and such. All in all the game is good for a few weeks, and soon it just gets tiresome."
5,sims unleashed is great you will have a blast,"sims unleashed is a really good game i got this game for my birthday and when i instaled it all my friends freaked out because they thougt the pets were the cutest little thing.you will have a blast watching these pets play.one of my favorite things thaT HAPPEND WAS WHEN ONE OF THE CATS HAD A KITTEN I NEVER GOT TO SEE IT YET BECAUSE IT IS IN A TENT BUT WHEN IT GETS OLDER YOU CAN SEE IT.YOU CAN GIVE THE PETS A BATH,YOU BUY THEM TOYS ,COLORS ,TREATS AND MORE.THERE ARE MORE SHOPS THEN JUST THE ADOPTION CENTER THERE ARE GARDENING SHOPS AND CAFE AYS.YOU CAN PUT YOU PETS IN A DOG SHOW BUT FIRST YOU HAVE TO TRAIN THEM TO DO TRICKS ALSO AT THE ADOPTION CENTER THERE IS A TRAINER THAT WILL TRAIN YOUR PETS I HAVE A MONEY CODE AND I WILL TELL YOU IT AT THE END OF THIS.WHEN YOU DOWNLOAD ALL THE SIMS IT IS ALL PUT INTO THE FIRST ADITON.MONEY CODE GIVES YOU A THOSAND EACH TIME THE CODE IS CTRL SHIFT C THEN TYPE ROSE BUD.I PROMASE YOU WILL LOVE THIS GAME."
3,Starting to get boring...,"Don't get me wrong The Sims is great, but after Vacation I started to get bored of all the Exspansion packs, not only that with every new installment it started to get more chopy, how they move in such, plus it takes 6 mins to load. This is still a fun game but it seems like they should start making somthing differnt that exspansion packs. Like another Sim City"
2,Best and Poor!,"I would like to say that when The Sims come, I got it and install it into my PC. It speed is normal for me.I only got max. 9fps for this.Then, I got the expansion pack Living Large.I am only got 5fps on it.House Party --- 4fpsHot Date --- (normal) 3fps (downtown) 0.1fpsVacation --- (Not available on my computer yet!)This expansion --- 1 fpsso what I am know is my Cyrix MII 300 is not yet for this game.What i hope is not its graphics but PERFORMANCE!Since its graphics is good.I rate it was a BEST game but also got its bad."
4,Pets for your Sim!,"If you are a pet lover, this expansion pack is definitely one to get! I absolutely love the addition of pets to the game - it's one of those extras that adds a new dimension of play to the game... as if you weren't already addicted enough... :)"
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"I didn't like this game that much. The animals, especially the dogs, got really annoying when I was trying to make two people become friends. I enjoyed the new careers, characters, and items, but the animals made the game really annoying. Plus, my computer is 5 years old and it took forever to load."
2,Boring!!,I got this game 4 monthes ago and all of a sudden itsall fuzzy and scratched up.I call this boring!
5,Really Cool!,"I think this expansion will be the best one of all! Mostly the reason I think this is because I absolutely adore pets and have always wanted them in my sims families'. In this expansion you can go to your local pet shop and buy a dog, cat,lizard, turtle, bird, or fish. And you can buy toys, dog houses, treats,and a lot more for you and your pets to enjoy. There are 125 objects in all. But that's not all you get! Also there are new skins. Another addition is gardening! Now your sims can buy seeds at the farmer's market and plant them in their garden. Once the seed has grown into a plant you can store it in your kitchen pantry or sell it at the farmer's market. Your pets will come in handy as they chase away the bunnies, mice, gophers, and other animals that come a callin. This game looks great! I'm buying it the first day it comes out!"
3,An O.K. Expansion,"Sure The Sims is a good game, but I am not happy with this expansion. First of all, you can't control your pet, you have to install two cd's, which takes a long time, cats and dogs takes up a family member spot(if you have seven members in your family you can only get one cat or dog), and also, everyone has been saying that you can get a monkey, well, to bad for us because you can't. All you can get are dogs, cats, turtles, iguanas, goldfish, love birds, and budgies(birds). The only good things is that you get three new neighborhoods, 15 community lots, a bunch of new items, new walls, roofs, wallpaper, floors, and cool new gardens which get destroied by gophers, bunnies, racoons , and skunks.That is why I give The Sims Unleashed only 3 out of 5 stars. Also if you don't know cheats press control, shift and C at the same time. Then type rosebud !;!;!;!;!; and then add k. It will say no such cheat, but if you hold enter, your money goes up."
4,The Art and Science of C,"I thought this was a wonderful beginners book. It gave me the basics and then allowed me to go on and try new things by myself. By the end I really felt like I could write my own programs in C.I only gave it four stars because I think five would have to be a textbook that really brought the information to life, while this one was rather dry."
5,Neova Night copper,Have used this night cream for a couple years. Love the way it feels on my skin. It doesn't make my face stick to the pillow and doesn't have a strong smell to stop up my head at night. Tried plenty of other night creams and this one works perfectly for me. I have so many allergies. Just wish it wasn't so expenseive!
4,Nearly perfect pen,"This pen is nearly perfect. My main issues are these: The Lamy rollerball tips are too wide for me and the cap on my pen does not stay on the back when writing.I had to switch to using Montblanc refills in my Lamy pen. My handwriting is small and cramped. The broader tips of the Lamy refills simply make too wide a line for my writing to be legible.Secondly, the cap will not stay on the back of the pen while I write. It constantly pops off. This is a minor inconvenience.I love the way this pen feels. The Montblanc refills provide an excellent rollerball experience. I love this pen.I am waiting for the day when I can get the Lamy 2000 fountain pen.I am a Lamy enthusiast. I just resurrected an old Safari fountain pen and use a Studio fountain pen at work every day."
3,Replacement Batteries are available,"I haven't been able to find it on Amazon, but if you google on the battery part number GP25AAH3BMX, you will find a link......[...]batteries are available, BUT they are $30.00 plus shipping.Unit works great -- 5*after 18 months quit working and new battery didn't fix it so have to replace whole unit -- not very good operating life -- 0*avg = 3*"
2,No Meat,"I used to love this magazine for the decorating ideas, but have since canceled my subscription. There is nothing but advertising for RX drugs on what seems like every other page. Some of the ads are 2 - 3 full pages! I understand that advertising pays for the magazine, but they have gone overboard. I used to check out their website as well and it's the worst. Pop us ads for magazine subscriptions everywhere to the point that it's super annoying. Bottom line is that this magazine has no meat in it anymore. It's fat with advertising overkill, so just beware."
1,Kindle edition not user friendly.,I bought the kindle edition of this magazine and was only able to read the one issue for one day. I have not been able to view that issue or download subsequent issues since. I am very disappointed and have canceled my subscription.
1,This Company is like a leech,"I purchased a 1 yr. subscription to this magazine. After a year i decided not to renew my subscription because not usable content and over advertisements. After returning a bill marked ""Do Not Renew"",I am being hounded with past due notices!!! Today ,i sent a letter restating my request by certified mail.Maybe this will get someone's attention!!! I also told them i was writing this review on Amazon & sending a copy of the letter to my local BBB. AVOID BHG like a plague. t. Zacharenko"
1,Rude customer service,"I've always enjoyed this magazine although it's nothing like it used to be.When my last subscription expired, they continued to send me invoices stating ""past due"",etc., but the icing on the cake was when they called me on Christmas Eve this pastyear to try and get me to renew.....REALLY..... are they that desperate for business???"
2,Wish I'd never spent the money,"I subscribed to BHG from their website and ended up subscribing to an additional year. The articles are helpful to a degree but the layout of this magazine, with its overwhelming amount of advertising, takes away from any good points. I've found the style to be choppy and very difficult to read because of the ads. It's hard to tell how long an article is or where it starts. I rarely find anything I'd want to save. Overall a disappointment."
5,Great Magazine,Wonderful magazine! Thank you for the opportunity to purchase at a great price!Brenda Cooper
4,Quick read,"This is a quick read magazine. I usually get some sort of idea from each issue. I do get tired of white walls, though (their go-to wall standard in the featured homes) and I'm never gonna be a decorative spend hours on food and crafts kind of mom - but there are some decorating ideas i use. So long as i never have to pay more than a dollar an issue, i'll keep ordering it."
1,Every other page is an advertisment,"Better Homes and Gardens has enticing covers, but once you flip through the pages, you are bombarded with advertising. It seems that the magazine's actual content consists of less than 10 pages. I'm left feeling short changed every month that my issue arrives. I do not plan on renewing this subscription."
1,can't get any info about my subscription!,"I ordered the two year plus the free recipe book. I have received nothing and the check was cashed over 2 months ago. Any email address for Better Homes and Garden does not work! Then when you call they say they don't have any record of my subscription, but I should be receiving my magazine in March!"
3,Too Green,"Better Homes and Gardens has recently started getting a little too Environmental for my taste. If I wanted to know about all the lastest Green products and how to reduce my carbon footprint and all I would by a magazine about that. I just want to know about garden layout, perennials, how to make tasty dinners and desserts, and decorating my house. I am not going to be trading in my 77 cub cadet for an electric push mower any time soon."
3,"love the magazine, hate the customer service","I have always loved the better homes and gardens magazine, and was so excited about finally getting my own subscription...until there was an issue with my subscription. there is no phone number that i can find on their website for me to speak to an actual person. I have sent over 5 emails to their customer service and have received 2 responses neither of which actually helps me. i think that they are just general responses that they send out to everyone and they have nothing to do with my questions or problems. I have never been so frustrated with a customer service before! Can't even say how tired i am of sending message that are completely ignored. makes me want to cry and really brings down the interest in their products, since they can't even treat their customers with a little respect."
1,Even the Articles Look Like Ads,"If you like advertisements, this is the magazine for you. The few articles that appear in the magazine consist of large photographs and very little text. So, if you should see a photo of a well-planned garden and want to learn more about it, there isn't enough information in the accompanying text. The text reads more like a caption for the photo. These articles are short, perhaps 4 or 5 pages. Even so, they are interrupted by pages of ads. And to make matters worse, the articles as laid out on the page look much like the ads. I paid about $10 for a one-year subscription. Not worth it. I felt like I was giving them money to recycle their paper for them."
1,Don't deal with this deceptive company,"I have a subscription to BHG. I went to the website to enter a sweepstakes. Next thing I know, I have another subscription. Can you say phishing, small print, time for a class action, deception, unethical?Getting the subscription cancelled took over 45 minutes of my time. Don't deal with this company."
5,Fisher Bullet Pen,"Fisher is the ONLY ball point pen that I use. I am an author and write my manuscripts with fountain pens. HOWEVER, for any and every other use I have, Fisher is the pen that I use. There simply is no comparison with any other ball point. It doesn't smudge. The refill seems to last forever. And, the pen goes together in a neat bullet shape (hence its name) that fits easily in my back pocket. If you want a clip pen, get something else. That's not the essence of the bullet. Oh, by the way, the pen is guaranteed for life. You just can't go wrong with this pen. I also have several stylus sized Fisher pens that I use on my desk, for bills, etc. They are all wonderful and, if you are interested in writing upside down or under water, something I rarely do, the pen has a pressurized cartridge. That's one of the reason it just about never skips or blots."
3,Pretty darned ordinary,I bought this book because Cameron's The Artist's Way changed my life majorly for the better--but I hope she sticks with non-fiction. I'm so disappointed--the effort in this one seems obvious. The word choice is repetitious--and half way through I found I didn't really care who the villain was. Maybe a super editor could have tightened it up a lot -- but that didn't happen.
4,"Julia Cameron makes a strong, though flawed, fiction debut.","Julia Cameron has bitten off a lot in her first novel. It is very much a first try--most notably where she trusts neither herself nor her readers enough and over-indulges didactic explanation, particularly in regard to Jung's concept of the shadow. Had she trusted herself enough to demonstrate it through her character's understanding or us to know about it already there would have been fewer slow-down patches. Her earnestness regarding her subject matter--the reality of horrific child abuse and the fortunate resiliency of the human person (at least some of the time)--kept me at some distance--AND I basically couldn't put the book down, with the result that I'm still in my nightgown as I prepare to get ready for bed.Quite an interesting read, with much to recommend it. I will definitely read her next novel."
3,A Fifty-something Fairy Tale,"""Sunset"" is a pre-senior rite of passage written with a pre-teen sophistication. The language is fuzzy was he (he was, she was, it was dominating the sentence structure) and the narrative plodding with scenes being continually rehashed as every character has to hear about just about everything that happens. Very sober problems of death, infidelity, illness and life's other crises and surprises are crammed into a two-week trip to France. In the audiobook it took three tapes to get to the guts of the story where two catty wives totally misjudge widower Robert's movie star guest. He, a sophisticted 63-year-old judge by day, is of course way too naive to see what's going on around him.It's not the worst 2002 summer novel, ""The Beach House"" and ""The Mighty Johns"" make it look good, but hardly worth the time or money."
2,The sun has set on Danielle Steel's writing.,"The reason I bought this book was because I wanted to get a taste of what St. Tropez was really like. I wanted to ""go"" there in my mind. What I got was a book about three late middle-aged couples and the various issues in their relationships. I suppose there is an audience out there who would appreciate this book, buy I am 40 and was bored to death. I did catch the names a few places to visit in St. Tropez (if they are real), but I couldn't really tell you much of anything about the French Riveria other than it is on the Mediterranean Sea and rich people go there to vacation.Danielle Steel has done much better writing in her former days. I feel like she got lazy on this novel and threw something together to sell a book.The ending is so ridiculous (even for romance novels) that I hope somebody stops Ms. Steel, before she stikes (writes) again."
1,HO HUM...,"Can you say HO HUM!? This book was a yawner! Ms. Steel bored me to death with her descriptions...it was like she thought I needed remedial help. Perhaps she was just running out of ideas so she felt she needed to be repeatative to fill in the page requirement. Nevertheless, I read this thinking that I would get her another shot after not reading anything by her in quite some time. Not going to waste my time again. Wonder who I can pawn my hardback off on...."
5,"The In-Laws, original","The original version of this movie with Falk is a long-standing favorite of mine. They could have saved the remake, it stinks."
1,The In Laws,the disc does not work. could not get one side to work at all. the other side played for about 30 min then stopped.
1,DVD Defective,"The DVD skipped at two points in the play (very annoying) for too lengthly a time.Informed seller.......who indicated that I should return the defective DVD for a replacement. I returned it, but to this day, have never received the replacement promised."
3,"Beats a dead horse, and not even the right one.","The authors have made up their mind to hate everything suburban, and do all they can to decry anything associated with the suburbs. For example, they love to deride the cul-de-sac, even doing so in the description. Cul-de-sacs serve a number of very important purposes, the most important of which is safety. There is a reason that urban areas block off street ends to turn them in to effective cul-de-sacs!In the end, this book ends up being targeted towards urban suburban-haters, telling them what they want to hear. Probably a great read for them. Too many obvious holes to the rest of us. And to make it worse, they take 300 pages to get across what could have been done in 50."
3,Not enough power,"Not enough power to really give enough pictures for the camera. It dies after a short period, especially if you use the flash. Unfortunately, if you have the camera, you don't have any choices."
1,Unpleasant,"Powerful perhaps; the movie is a domino effect of terrible, unbelievable choices that lead to the deaths of far too many primary characters. Simple cinematic transitions end up being over-dramatized five minute segments. Two hours into the movie, you'll be asking yourself: where's Shahrukh? The answer is not worth the wait."
3,Edwin: Bollywood Review,"This movie plays the ""power"" of love against the ""power"" of fear. Karisma delivers an excellent performance, and Shahrukh does want he normally does so well- he entertains. The dance scene with him and Aishwayra is mind-blowing and packed with energy. It alone is enough reason to see and buy the movie. All the supporting cast were purely incredible as well. This film is a total package: a little bit of drama, a little bit of action and a little bit of comedy."
5,For my sport lovin husband,My husband has always loved Sports Illustrated so I renewed his subscription. It's the best sports magazine according to him.
2,Doubles,We renewed our subscription through Amazon about 2 months before the original completely ran out so we would not miss one. For the last two issues we received 2 magazines. The new one should have started when the first ended. Since there is an overlap we will lose out on least 2 issues at the end of this subscription unless we call SI and try to work it out with them. We never have this problem when we order through SI directly.
2,Must have been a first draft,"Very poorly written novel! Just in the first part of the book, he interogates a rider, yet Priest who was driving behind him in another car is nowhere! Sometimes the plot is written with the characters making so illogical decisions and events so improbable as to create near impossible situations. How a headlight dropping causes enough noise to be noticed, but subsequent scrabbling along a gravel railbed does not and why the villian does not pick up the headlamp are but a few examples."
2,A Major Disappointment from a Terrific Writer,"Ridley Pearson is among my favorite authors, but ""Parallel Lies"" reads like a first draft. Pearson needed to go back and give us a more well drawn ultimate bad guy, explain how his science teacher vigilante transformed himself into the Rogue Warrior, and make the security expert who looks like a ""supermodel"" more than a romantic cliche.Hero Peter Tyler, however, is a good creation, and I wouldn't mind seeing him in a better book-- which Pearson's next is likely to be."
2,Derailed plot,"Borrowing a premise from ""Trainman"", Pearson moves away from his usual characters, and gives us a slow boring ride. Trying to make the bad guy good and populating his story with all the pc stereotypes sucks the life out of this one. Don't write a book a year, if its going to be mediocre."
5,One Heck of a Ride,"Ridley Pearson's writing hooks you with the very first paragraph. With his exciting plots, deep characters and technically accurate police investigations, it's always impossible to put his books down. And ""Parallel Lies"" is no different. There are plenty of twists and turns to keep you guessing, but Ridley doesn't use this to confuse the reader. He puts you right into Peter Tyler's mind, lets you think what he's thinking, lets you figure things out along with him. And it's loads of fun! I highly recommend ""Parallel Lies"" and all of Ridley's books!"
2,Is It Over Yet; Why Can't I read faster,"Terribly disappointing. Wish I could stop reading a book once I start it, because this would be one that would qualify. Story seemed convulted, boring, and way too technical that made it implausible. It was very hard to picture the final train scene. I did like the ending though (maybe because I couldn't wait to get there). Nowhere near as good as ""Middle of Nowhere"""
1,Support is a Joke,"Don't waste your money on this (especially if your player is a Sony). Tried to backup one of my favorite DVDs to preserve the original, and it wouldn't play on the Sony (did play on the computer, however). Went to the site, read all the information in the FAQ section pertaining to my problem, couldn't resolve it, so I emailed them. After three emails, none of which I think they actually read (the first reply was a word for word copy of the FAQ section!), I was told my burner wasn't supported, and to either wait until it was, or return the product to the store."
2,Glutens,"This book had the same old stuff in it that I have read many times before. The only additions were the evolution ""facts"" in it and there were a lot of them. That really ruined the whole book."
3,Dumbed down but informative,"The writer comes across in the first chapter or two as a man with a mission and he is really pushing his point, and a lot of the rest of it is really dumbed down for the average joe to be able to comprehend, but that's okay, too. There's a lot of good stuff in here. If you're one of the many walking (or lying) around with gluten sensitivity and the resulting health problems, the information contained herein can be of great help, if only in educating those around us."
5,Great Bag!,"I ordered this bag for my wife and she loves it. It has all of the features that she wanted and more, even included a water bottle. It is light weight and carries everything you need for a nice walking round of golf."
2,A little upset.,"I recieved the dvd within a couple days of ordering it,but when I opened it the button in the case was broken which caused the dvd to be scratched. Now I know this is not your fault,and that I could have returned it but I did not have the money to send it back. Now if I ever buy thru again could you please make sure that everything is perfect,I am very anal about my movies. Other than that you guys are great,I just wish that you had a phone number I could call to reach your company at.Thank You,Michael Bordo"
5,REAGAN IS THE GREATEST U.S. PRESIDENT OF THE 20TH CENTURY!,"I have always been a great fan and admirer of President Ronald Reagan! He restored the American pride within us all. As an admirer of President Reagan, I could not resist reading this book. I found it to be very beneficial to my understanding of the greatest U.S. president of my lifetime. This book gives the reader a better understanding of the personal events that shaped the life and career of President Reagan. The book makes Ronald Reagan appear friendly and approachable. It made me long for a return to REAGANOMICS!"
4,Great autobiography,"He presents his life and its nuances extremely well . There is little that is left unconvered in the book. Unfortunently many will not read this triumph of the American spirit and possibilities only due to the fact that it is Ronald Reagan, a Consersavite"
5,An American Life: Ronald Reagan,"An outstanding look into the life and thoughts of the most conservative leader of our time. The video book, being read by the 'MAN' himself adds a great deal of interest and pride in the fact that I lived during his Presidency."
5,Amazing Read,This book is a fantastic read! Includes tons of interesting stories and powerful insight to American history! Enjoy!
5,In his own voice,"It was a detailed account of his life prior to and while being the president told as if the words were coming out of his mouth, I can hear him telling his story."
3,The Autobiography of Ronald Regan,"This well written autobiography of the life and times of Ronald Regan from his perspective is as is most autobiograpy's, self serving. However, it does make for some interesting reading. President Regan reveals some little known facts about his history and his exile from the Democratic Party and to become the GOP man of the century. Unfortunately this book does the same as every other book written about this man it leaves you with the feeling of ""I just can't figure him out"". It's worth the money and your time to read his side of the story."
2,Buy only if you're not offended by gay porno film,"I bought this book thinking that it would give a behind-the-scene look at the pornographic film industry. I did not expect it to be about a GAY porno film set.Many of the photos are fairly well taken in a documentary style and a few even managed to inject a bit of humour into the work of the cast and supporting crew, like a ""gay"" actor jerking off with a copy of Penthouse. Another ""funny"" photo shows a crew member looking away as two naked male actors hugged and French-kiss passionately off the camera. However most of the photos show how seriously the crew treat their work.But be warned, buy this book only if male homosexual pornography does not offend you. Otherwise, stay away."
5,A very well written book,This is a very well written book. I would recommend it highly. It has wonderful photos and descriptions. Nice history as well.
4,How to book,"A book for the intermediate metalsmith with beautiful photography of both technique described and finished pieces. The instructions are clear and well presented. You might find this in someone's studio as a reference, so make it your own if you are interested in learning how to apply color using glass (that is what enamel is) on metal."
5,Awesome resource for bird owner's,I have been a reader for a few years. The pictures alone are worth the price. I always learn something new.
1,This was a waist of money the magazine is now defunct.,"just 2 weeks ago, I got a notice from bow tie inc. that they are no longer going to be printing birdtalk magazine. So this is a defunct magazine. Do Not Subscribe to this magazine. they will push you off onto one of their other publications, dog fancy, cat fancy, horse something or other. Repeat September 2012 is the last issue of this magazine to ever be printed."
1,Same information month after month,"I subsribed to this magazine for 1 year and stopped it after that. The magazine reads like a book with the same information month after month. The topics and articles are regularly repeated. If you want general knowledge about birds, get a book. If you are looking for up-to-date information, you won't find it in this magazine."
4,a good magazine,"This has been a good magazine, so I ordered a renewal subscription for my 13 year old daughter. Informative and entertaining- I read through all the issues myself."
3,Bird Talk Magazine,"I think for a novice aviculturist, the magazine is a great start to learning about our beautiful feathered friends and gaining great access to avian products.The largest drawback to BT is the polyanna attitude towards birds. All the parrots are described as wonderful pets with wonderful personalities. They fail to elaborate on the HUGE downfalls of owning parrots and skirt real life issues such as hundreds of birds in rescues and shelters."
2,Dumbed Down!,"I used to get this magazine in the 80's 90's and found it very interesting but since the advent of the internet where you can find anything about anything you want, todays Bird Talk has nothing more than anecdotal stories for 9 year olds and a lot of advertising. Too Bad! I wish I had my old collection from 18 years ago. Reading current issue's is like reading Ranger Rick! I havent found anything really usefull and I could read the whole mag in 5 minutes. It was a waste of money."
5,Bird Talk,I have really enjoyed this magazine. The articles are informative and interesting. The pictures of the birds are beautiful. I would definitely reccommend this book to all bird lovers.
4,Amazing!,"This bag is fabulous. I've been using it for a week now, I've yet to take it on a trip yet but I have high hopes. Im one of those girls who after getting ready to go out my makeup is all over my counter. This bag eliminates that problem! Also, no more rummaging in a huge bag unable to find what I need. I can see everything laid out or hang it up, it's fantastic! I love the loops too because I can stick my tweazers and brow scissors in there for easy access! Seriously this bag is fabulous! The only reason I gave 4 stars is because I'm waiting till I take it flying next week."
2,Lots of nudity,"I purchased the Best of Beauty Magazine (Allure October 2006 issue) to see the list of best beauty products. The list was incomplete, so far I've noticed that they left out eye cream this time. Pictures had a lot of nudity so I wouldn't buy it any other month."
5,we laugh so hard we cry!!!,"Patrick is so funny, especially if you have been there! We are a family of back packers and oh boy have we been there! There is nothing like reading Mcmanus after a hard day of climbing, swearing and sitting around the campfire!!! He is wonderful!"
3,Rate it C,Not as enjoyable as other of his books. Seemed as if he was reaching to complete the book and ran out of good ideas.
4,Very funny outdoor stories,"Very funny, if you embarress easily don't read this book on a airplane. This book brought back many of my childhood camping memories, mostly the humorous ones worth remembering. If you are the outdoor type i would recommend reading or any of Patrick McManus' other books."
5,Trance to the next level,"We,, where can i start this cd is great i advise every trance fan to get it b/c its a must have. You will not be dissapointed phil b. delivers through and through.This cd is very dreamy yet fast paced all at the same time. Its so hard to describe so i'll just say this.......GET THIS NOW or you will be missing out on one of the greatest trance cds ever created. Phil B. is a mastermind trance genious!"
5,A Heartwarming tale,"This story is of a family, The Pyes, that get a new dog and their adventures with ""the smartest dog in town"". With the ""Mysterious footstepper"" and ""The person with the Mustard-yellow hat"" this family has tons of adventures. Truly Magnificent!!!"
5,National Treasure meets CSI,"Raising the Hunley skillfully combines the history of the lost, top-secret Confederate submarine H.L. Hunley with the modern day search and recovery operation that brought it from its watery grave to national limelight. The author keeps a good pace throughout, and weaves seamlessly between times and events. Equally replete with recountings of the gruesome deaths of the Hunley's first two crews, the legal maneuvering the surrounded the sub at every stage of its life and the impressive scientific undertakings involved in excavating the ship, the book has something for everyone."
2,Beware Higher Prices on Amazon Site,"This magazine, Artforum International and Art in America are all higher on the amazon.com site than on their respective web sites. Super-natural coincidence, or profit-taking?Beware ArtNews web price, too - in the magazine, they are charging 19.98 for 11 issues, but not on the web.Michael Hawkhttp://hawk.herronhaven.com"
3,Art news renewal.,I did not want to renew it this year because hardly anyone checks it out in the library. I will not renow for 2014.
2,Dont buy it,"It is pretty fun but like the last veiwer i want a cockpit view. It isnt very well built, Lots of errors (no wonder it was only 20 bucks.)"
2,"This is one botched game, what happened in network play",I wanted to post this just as an FYI for anybody who fell in love with the original hot pursuit. This game's hot pursuit mode is totally heinous. EA really botched it. You can't be the police and chase down bad guys with your buddies over the network. We bought a bunch of copies found this out and sold a bunch of copies totally lame. So just a heads up
5,great seat,"Great seat! No problems so far.....installed it in Feb or so. It does loosen every now and then (the fit to the car, not the harness in the seat). I don't know what causes it, could be something with our seats. Our son seems to be comfortable in it. We had to hook the tether onto an ""anchor point"" on the rear of the front passenger seat, and this was kind of awkward but seems to work. Great straps, no twisting."
5,Great Seat!,"I did a lot of research on the convertible car seats out there when our daughter outgrew her infant carrier. I bought this one because of the safety rating and all of the positive reviews. I could not be more pleased. It was easy to install, the seat is very comfy for her - nice and padded. (check this before you buy because some brands have no padding at all in the seat). The denim is breathable because it is 100% cotton and it is very soft on her skin. It may cost a little more than some of the other car seats out there but it is well worth it. I Highly recommend this product!"
1,Very poor transfer,"This is a review of the Elstree Hill DVD of Spartacus and the Ten Gladiators. Whatever one may think of the movie itself, no film deserves the terrible kind of transfer that Elstree Hill has given this movie. Taken in by the the extremely nice packaging I bought this hoping it would be an inprovement over all the dreadful quality incarnations this movie has previously had on DVD.Not so. It is absolutely terrible...in fact, almost unwatchable. Avoid this one no matter how cheap you may find it."
1,not scientific and taken out of context,"these two authors are pretty radical right-wing non-scientists who distort facts and use them out of context to ""support"" their views. i read this book back in college in an environmental politics class. the prof wanted us to read it to understand the other side - the purpose was for students to realise that such arguments against environmentalists are not sound and this book can be classified under fiction."
2,Absolutely not a bedtime reading ;),"This is a good book to be criticized. To understand what Lichter and Rothman wrote, I need to read this book sentence by sentence. If you read this book, DO NOT forget to read the footnote, because without reading the footnote you could misinterpret the content of this book. Their writing styles will make you need a special time to read this book."
2,Not helpful in study,"I tried hard to work with this book. The only its doubtful advantage is the number of examplas. But what to do with them if there is no any explanations, no any reference formulas etc.?I consider it as a usless book. This is a book for himself, not to help you study the subject. Try SCHAUM Hydraulics...! It is much better even there are less examples."
3,Rather hard going,"While I found Crispin's characters good on the whole, there were times when I had to stop reading to get my bearings. Although keeping in mind the time it was written I find his style rather ponderous and even long-winded. There is a great deal of overwriting I feel. Too many references to classical literature for my taste, and too many Latin quotes, well over my head.The plot was good and I completely overlooked the real murderer.On the whole I found it hard going. I doubt I will try more of his work.The Case of the Gilded Fly"
1,Sucker broke in 30 seconds,We brought this fryer home put some oil in it and kaplooy it quit working. It didn't even work for 30 seconds.
4,Fuller coverage of sports than S.I.,"TSN covers more sports than SI and is more informative than ESPN the Mag. ( ESPN is too interested in trying to be hip and sarcastic, catering to the younger crowd). I only wish TSN was a weekly instead of twice a month."
5,damnnnn,Ay yo....this cd is HOTT. Its full of energy n its got good sound. My fav song is Into You wit ashanti...that song is hott...its been in my head 4 like a week. I luv cant let u go too...n i mean i luv alll tha songs...im sayin u gotta go cop this cd...its sick
2,Street Dreams-fabolous,well i can just about say cant let you go saves this album im afraid and its a damn good song. up and lots of downs. 1st fabolous monotone i mean i got over that ages ago! when gangstarr relised the owners! so thats a down point and those piss weak lyrics are dreadful. and that piss weak rip off of a doctor dre song with snoop makin a fool of him self basicly saying that he was at is peak ages ago! also into is a ok song not the best but o.k boutta 7/10 all the other songs are rubbish! i dont no its just that he hasnt got the whole package! and real talk is crap to!
1,What the hell????!!!!!!,"I'm a collector of good music, and trust me I have over 2000 cd's to prove it. When Justin Timberlake came out, I bought the limited edition for collection purposes, and the regular version to play. However, this cd is confusing. If you look carefully on the back, under executive producer, there is a sticker that says: WAKE UP does not appear on this album. When I checked 3 different websites to find out how many versions of this album are out, the track listing came up different 3 ways! As much as I like Fabolous. Fabolous and his team need to tighten up on the detailing of the cd releases with their name on it."
1,Well...Here's another Ja Rule ! ! !,"What can I say. Fabolous started off spittin' punchline filled rhymes on DJ Clue mixtapes and made a name for himself. With his freshman release GHETTO FABOLOUS, he came with some mixed material. Some hard hitting and some soft material. Then Fab collabed with P. Diddy for "" Trade it all ( remix ) "" which started his downfall. STREET DREAMS is a poor attempt to go soft and boost up his sales. Tracks such as "" Call me "","" Into you "" and "" My life "" are just attempts to go pop ( as if he wasn't pop enough ).But the track that is completely garbage is "" Can't let you go "", where Fabolous is basically saying he can't let go of his girlfriend even though he has another. Not a great message there. The production is just weak. Nuff said. Maybe this cat should just remember where he came from and thats spittin punchlines. Ladies and gentlemen, I present another Ja Rule ! ! !"
5,Who is Rebecca Levine & Why is She Reviewing Rap Albums?,"She don't know what she talking about, naming names like M.o.p. and 50 Cent. $%$^ that, Fabolous's new album the best thing ever. People who don't like this are stupid."
4,GO OUT AND BUY IT!,"Hey guys whats up! Well i do have to say that I never bought or even considering buying a fabolous album before but i just heard his album ""street dreams"" on AOL FULL LISTENING CD PARTY and It is very good. A MUST BUY! i considered just downloading it but its worth buying so believe i am going to cop that. I dont know what all the hype is about 50 cent when your hear fab's cd and his multi hits, he will rival eminem himself. You will be like 50 cent who? a- fellas,"
2,Stupid game - memorize and win,"If you like to play games where you know where the enemy is and can turn a corner and shoot to kill - this is the game for you. The format remains exactly the same every time. Your ""team"" does nothing but get in your way. I liked a couple of the early delta force games but this one SUCKS."
3,Slow MO,"I'am reluctant to say this game disapointed me. I own both delta force games prior to this one and they too were not that great.I have a 1.6 ghz computer with AMD Athlon and 386mgs. of SDRAM along with a NVIDIA 32MB video card. DFBHD suffers from bad lag.the normal requirments are atleast a 32MB video, but iam not going to buy a faster one just cuase this game is slow. the other delta force games were also slow on other computers I tried. To say the least Iam not going to purchase a nother game from novalogic. they have still yet to get back to me about fixing the slowness on BLACK HAWK DOWN. I have yet to play the game without giving up because it is to slow to play. MAYBE someone has a suggestion?"
2,AI - What is that?,"I don't know what game the other reviewers have been playing, but the AI of the Black Hawk Down that I have been playing is just aweful. Your squad consists of you and the three stoogies; your squad mates can't hit the broad side of the barn when it comes to the bad guys even if the bad guy is standing right next to them so you will have to spearhead to do almost all of the shooting; however, the the three stoogies will take this opportunity to shoot you in the back or from the side or they will run in front of you and block your shoots. You cannot give the three stoogies command so they just basically do whatever. The civilian will run between you and the bad guys, but don't worry because the three stoogies are good at shooting the civilians. The AI of the enemies are just as bad. They shoot all over the place and wander around like idiots most of the times. This game is nowhere near the sophistication of Ghost Recon."
3,Not as good as it should be....,"First, let me say that BHD looks fantastic! This is a serious improvement over previous offerings in the Delta Force series. The city is sprawling and realistically dirty and rundown. The vehicles are very detailed. Explosions and smoke are fantastic.So, why three stars? The game is unbelievably hard! Too hard to be considered fun. Your AI teammates are worthless. They won't help you one bit, so you are left to fight approximately 100 people per mission on your own. All this adds up to extreme frustration. Not what I paid [this price] for.It seems that very little thought/design was put into this aspect of the game. What's disappointing is that the hectic feel of the game really creates an atmosphere that is different from most FPS shooters on the market. A definite plus I think. If only it played as good as those other games...."
4,Great Collection Featuring Some of Cheap Trick's Greatest,"This great new CD has a full load of 16 hits selected by the band members themselves. I especially enjoyed the live 1998 performance of ""The Flame,"" being released for the first time. The real live version of ""I Can't Take It"" was especially appealing. I'm glad the band selected to include the singles version of ""Southern Girls,"" which was missing from their last ""Greatest Hits"" CD that was released back in 1992. ""If You Want My Love"" is presented in the alternate version, and sounds great. The full length version of ""Everything Works If You Let It"" rates high. Chrissie Hynde is featured on ""Walk Away."" All in all I am happy to add this to my Cheap Trick collection. This has my 4 star recommendation."
3,One (major) disappointment to consider before purchasing.,"This is not a bad collection. I'm sure there have been worse. My main complaint is the alternate version of ""If You Want My Love."" To me it's a major letdown because that is one of my favorite Cheap Trick songs and I really was expecting to hear it when I bought this. Now I wish I had not even bought it.I don't think ""authorized"" versions are the way to choose songs, the band is always too subjective. They should have taken a poll from amongst their fans, and chosen the results that way. Plus, the omission of one of their greatest recorded songs will potentially lose new listeners who are not as familiar with the band's music."
1,Not a book for serious operators,"Given the impressive records of the authors I would have thought they'd be able to put together a much more comprehensive book, which btw I wouldn't have minded paying a lot more for - provided it had current info and not stuff from a 1970's SF manual. This contains very basic information written over a weekend with information that could have been plucked from the web with a few google searches. Not a book for serious operators."
2,Not This Time,"I'm a big Seidel fan. I think she's one of the unknown treasures of romance fiction. That said, this book really didn't work for me. It felt like rehash of a lot of the themes and dynamics which she explored so brilliantly in Til the Stars Fall. I also had a hard time liking the hero.My suggestion, if you like second chance at love stories and you want to try Seidel, pick up Til the Stars Fall instead of this."
4,Nice book document why these pictures were taken,I enjoyed this book very much. Basically its 80 images with the photographer explaining the backstory and why he took the photo he did. Its a great way to understand composition and color matching.
5,Machine Embroidery With Confidence for Beginners,"This is great book. Fills in the gaps left by the embroidery machine's instructional manual. If you are new to machine embroidery, you need this book to learn how to do things that the owner's manual does not show you. Such as correct placement of the item in the hoop and other information. A must have for newbie machine embroiderers."
2,awful,"Ok, this is clean and if that is all you want, its here.. But KK has no timing, he is stiff, and his material is cliche.. It is so mild, which is OK, but boy is this flat.. At least 20 mins to long.. he is not ready for an hour show, Slow, boring, he needs to edit his routine.. but he is clean.."
5,"Delightful, splendid","This was the first Christmas CD I ever bought and I still regard it as the best I have. It covers the range from the sacred to the merry, worshipful to cheer, and every song is a gem. It includes what is simply the best recording of 'Gaudete, Christus Est Natus' that I've ever heard, and one of the finest renditions of 'Patapan And Farandole'. The more traditional carols such as 'Deck The Hall' are delivered with aplomb and celebration.If you only want one Christmas CD, this is the one to buy."
4,90% great,"The vast majority of this disc contains just what you would expect from the Kings Singers UNTIL you get to Track 11, ""The Coventry Carol (Lully, lulla)"" (16th-cent. English), arranged by Daryl Runswick, according to the liner notes. This is like no ""Coventry Carol"" I've ever heard! To say that it was dissonant would be an understatement.Please know that I have a Masters in Music History so I've heard and enjoy all kinds of music and in another context, I might like this arrangement. But not when it follows such typically arranged carols."
3,"Not the best Marx film, but it still has it's moments.","Ok, not every Marx film can have high paced slapstick, but this picture did not entirely lack comedy. Groucho's interaction with Margaret Dumont was among his best, and the way all 3 brothers turned the store upside down still reflected their classic humor. The ""Tenament Symphony"" number definately could have been left out as it is intensely boring, but the highly energetic ""Sing While You Sell"" makes up for it. Also the department store setting was very unique for a Marx film."
3,"Not a total flop...no ""Duck Soup"" either.","I was extremly hesitant before buying this movie with all the bad things i'd heard about it. The first half of the movie I gound to be quite enjoyable but it did tank pretty fast in the second half. Overall though it wasn't so bad. Certainly alot better then most of the reviews I've read for it. I don't believe this was the worst of their lot...it was ok. But still doesn't even come close to classics like ""Duck Soup"", ""A Day At The Races"" or ""Animal Crackers"" just to name a few."
2,No glowing endorsement!,"I bought this because so many said it was so good. Well, in my case it is pretty ""iffy.' I have neuropathy and cannot feel the buttons and holes with one hand and need my sensitive hand to pull the hook part, so feeding the thing thru the button hole has proved daunting. And while this DOES have a zipper pull and does fit in my pocket, if I could feel the darn zipper tab I could pull it.Fishing for it with the hook isn't very effective. I guess if you can feel with your finger tips, but not actually button a shirt, it would be OK, but shipping costs twice what the item did, So that was strike one!"
2,Cheap product,I purchased this for my son who has no left hand. The button hook was cheap and pulls out of the handle. The zipper hook seems fine. I should have spent a few more dollars for a more durable button pull.
5,The Andrew Lloyd Webber Collection,I never received it from RACHEL4987. I have told her twice and I have told you twice to no avail. I am not a happy customer.
4,Selections that show Brightman's considerable range,"In the ""The Andrew Lloyd Webber Collection,"" Sarah Brightman, ex-wife of the composer Andrew Lloyd Webber sings a selection of his work, all of which are well done but a few are outstanding. Brightman gets to display her considerable range in these selections. There are several selections from ""The Phantom of the Opera."" Of these selections ""The Music of the Night"" is especially well done. I was not familiar with ""Love Changes Everything"" but found this to be one of the strongest selections on the CD. I realize this sound odd, but her version of ""Don't Cry for Me Argentina"" was probably the weakest selection on the CD. However another selection from Evita, ""Another Suitcase in Another Hall,"" was very well presented. Only on a few selections, such as ""Memory"" does a slight screech begins to emerge from her usually warm voice. Yet, `Pie Jesu' was perfect and the entire collection ends with `The Music of the Night', her strongest performance."
5,More Sarah Magic,"I'm a Sarah Brightman fan and looked forward to her interpretations of Andrew Lloyd Webber's music. It's a great album, ranging from the ethereal ""Piu Jesu"" to the gritty ""Don't Cry For Me"" and Sir John Gielgud's spoken lyrics. As I listen to her duet with Jose Carreras, I find myself wondering why she never collaborated with Placido Domingo."
4,Value,"Mature, well practiced and versatile voice. CD's vary considerably in content, so be sure to preview before buying."
4,"Beautiful, but lacking something...","I bought this CD ages ago for ALW's music. I'm a big fan of his work. Ms. Brightman does a lovely job on most of these songs, but like some people have said, her voice is too shrill. I much preferred Emmy Rossum's performance as Christine, I'm sorry, but Ms. Brightman's high notes penetrate my defenses and give me an awful headache sometimes. In my opinion, she sounds far lovlier on the lower songs."
3,Master it BETTER Please !,"I love Sarah Brightman's voice and I bought this CD for the song Pie Jesu. It is my understanding that this selection was ""lifted"" directly from the original analog source. Perhaps this is why there is significant hum and other background noise on this track. I took the first CD back and exchanged it. No improvement. I would still purchase this CD, however, this track is disappointing."
5,Historical Motorcycle racing,"Great coverage of early motorcycle racing, especially in England/Europe. This is the first in a series for coverage up at modern racing."
1,xbox 360 no go,"As another reviewer correctly pointed out this will not work on an xbox360. The information on this item needs an immediate update which i will see that it gets to prevent others from mistakenly purchasing this game for a system it wont work on at all. Very, very disappointing."
3,more Spy Hunter audio flaws and No Gauntlet 2?,"First off, Gauntlet 2 was way better than the original, why not include it as well or instead?And as for Spy Hunter, well, I am one of the biggest fans, and the Peter Gunn theme is still and perhaps never will be emulated exactly the way it was in the original arcade, not to mention the 'death' sequence sometimes doesn't play when you die. Most of the sound effects have a weaker than original sound to them as well. The control however is tight and the graphics are as about original as I can tell.P.S. Where are Moon Patrol & Burgertime? It's high time to emulate All Points Bulletin (APB) and NARC!(UPDATE: Wow, they finally gave us APB and NARC on Midway Treasures 2, but geez luiz they miss the great Moon Patrol and Burgertime once again, I guess they expect us to keep playing them on earlier systems?)"
1,Mis leading description,When searching for this game on Amazon I was looking for a game that was could be played on the 360. In the description of this game is stated in could and therefore I purchaced it.Well that was incorrect and now I own a worthless game. Guess I should have googled the question first.
2,Against baby biology,"The problem with the idea of a ""self-calmed"" infant is that human infants aren't biologically designed to calm themselves. Like all higher primates and many mammals, our babies grow and thrive best with an abundance of hands on parenting and ""in arms"" care during infancy. Baby sleep patterns are different from adults' for a good reason: growth and safety. Babies need to nurse at night and their infantile sleep-wake cycles appear to be protective against SIDS. This idea that we should ""teach"" our babies independence is a recent western cultural construct. It opposes all previous human history and most other world cultural care-giving patterns.Also, as a mother of three young children, I encourage mothers of infants to *enjoy* and treasure the fun of rocking, snuggling, nursing, and sleeping with that sweet-smelling baby. Infancy paases very quickly.Katie Allison Granju Author, ""ATTACHMENT PARENTING: Instinctive Care for Your Baby and Young Child"""
2,Take it with a grain of salt,"I got this for our second child. Our first is a champion thumb sucker, but #2 was having trouble getting the knack. Some of the information is interesting, but I found myself feeling horribly guilty for how I had handled our first child, and began to wonder if her behavior now is ""my fault"" vs just being a typical two year old.So read it with a grain of salt."
5,"Although most disliked it, I found it helpful.","After reading the other ladies responses, mine doesn't seem to fit in. However, I did call Dr. Sammons at the Red-Tae Association and got direct and personal consultation from him. Some of the things that have been written above may have been misunderstood because I got clarification on all points. Dr. Sammons desire is to empower the mother AND the child. I did follow his advice, both personal and written, with a very loving and gentle attitude helping my child to see that he CAN handle it. I didn't find this book until my child was almost one year old but I wish I had found it sooner. My second child did not have the same sleep issues that my first did."
2,Prior,"Although only eight years old, 'ISDN' appears to be from a completely different era - one in which fractals were extremely cool, ISDN itself was strange and exotic, and extended sample-heavy dub jams with gated reverb were the cutting-edge of 'intelligent techno music'. This is essentially a less-slick variation on 'LifeForms', in that it combines overproduced mid-tempo breakbeats with a surface sheen of 'high art', one which is demolished by the smug inlay notes. It's as if the group were ashamed to be producing dance music, but weren't smart enough to do anything else. 'Accelerator', for example, was more vital and alive, whilst this and 'LifeForms' seem to be the sound of two people showing off their in-depth knowledge of an Akai S1100. There is a happy ending, of sorts - their last album, 'Dead Cities', was fantastic."
4,A Good Read,"In Mirage and Chimera, Mark Tiedemann showed that he could tell a gripping story at novel length, and wasn't just a talented short fiction writer. In Compass Reach, set in the mid-23rd century in an FTL universe, he avoids two of the major traps of modern space opera. To wit: this book faces the possibility of powerful AIs that may become sentient, and it has aliens in it that aren't just humans in rubber suits. Besides that, it tries to come to grips with some of the inherent fallacies of our economic systems. There is good storytelling here, and a wide-ranging adventure experienced by a character who is neither a super-hero nor an out-of-work ninja...which is a refreshing change from much of what passes for science fiction these days. My only real complaint about the book is that the copy-editor (one Teddi Stransky, according to the copyright page) needs to learn that ""for awhile"" is neither grammatical nor defensible. Four stars."
3,Slow,This is OK... but sort of dull. It didn't keep my grandchirdens interest for more then just a few minutes. It needed a little something more.
4,Jack Frost,It was the traditional presentation of the story and enjoyed hearing Buddy Hacket in his role. Animation was ok but expected less than HD for such an older production.
4,Good holiday movie,"This is a fun claymation movie to watch around the holidays. My 2 and 5 year old enjoyed it, although it isn't one they would watch more than 1-2 times."
5,nothing else to say,"what else can i say? these things do exactly what they were built for, and im even getting my after hours activities done on top of them, that makes them nice and sturdy."
2,I don't know...,"The stilts stick out of the squaring of the bed too much. If you have a bed skirt that does not have 12"" worth Latin on the floor already these are lame and could be seen."
1,"poor quality, don't buy","We purchased a house full of Danze plumbing fixtures. The kitchen one (D409012SS) has been a problem since we bought it. They claim lifetime warantee, but plumber has been here twice, they sent the wrong part, then want to charge for postage. I will end up paying bigtime for this junk even if they replace it.The cheap stuff at home depot is a better deal."
1,Liked it till they canceled and now im getting Dog Fancy?,"It is ridiculous that they didn't plan ahead. I just paid for my subscription and only used half of it. Now since they are stopping to publish I am going to get a dog magazine instead? They should refund my money. I didnt order a dog magazine, I ordered a fish magazine."
4,good!,"I think this are good, however the size of this mirrors for a regular car or SUV its just too big, not their fault, but I recommend buying the smaller one for a regular car, truck, pickup or SUV, will be more than enough"
4,Get Rid of Blind Spots,"I bought 2 of these to replace similar blind spot mirrors I had on my Jeep Liberty. I like these better than my old ones, which were a different brand. The old ones had grown foggy over time. These have a better quality reflective surface than my old ones did when I bought them new. I would recommend these for passenger vehicles with standard size mirrors. They take care of the blind spots without covering up much of the rest of the mirror. However, if your mirrors are larger - and could accommodate it - I would recommend a larger size, because 1.25"" x 2.25"" is actually quite small. Be aware that these do come with the ""Objects in mirror are closer than they appear"" warning and that there is only one mirror per package."
5,Remember Shakti Mius One - Indian Style,"When John Mclaughlin reformed the legendary band Shakti as ""Remember Shakti"", violinist L. Shankar was not able to participate. So here, at the turn of the millennium, he gathers Shakti members Zakir & Vikku together as a Classical Indian version of Remember Shakti. The album is quite fine and is dedicated to Zakir's father, Ustad Allarakha, an incredible tabla master and Ravi Shankar's frequent collaborator."
1,Problems with DVD,"You may not be aware, but I received a defective DVD, I was unable to view it, so I returned it and received another defective DVD...I am currently waiting for either a satisfactory replacement or a refund."
2,Pop music at its worst...,"This album Beware of the dog is just plain out horrible...Now everyone has a different opinion,but I'm sure alot of people will agree with on that fact that this wannabe hip-hop album is over produced and like most pop music...A little 13yrs boy rapping about how women want him so bad just don't sound right I'm sorry...""Bounce with me"" and ""Bow Wow(that's my name)"" are the two singles wre-leased so far and are the only two songs worth recognizing though i hate both of them!!!Just same your money becuase this album aint worth a time man I don't rap all the time and I could sound so much better then him and you can bet on it..."
5,great debut,this was the 1st gangsta rap album I bought so I really had no idea what to expect when i bought it i fell in love with it my grandpa hates but what does he know he's old some people say bow wow had to many people on his album well thats the thing about rap stars they like to always be wit their homies so on rap albums 90% of the songs feature someone the snoop cd only had like 3 or 4 solo's out of 19 songs the eve cd had only about 2 or 3 the new missy elliott only had 4 or 5 anywayss you get the point so don't hate on him just cuz he had lots of help on this album and please don't make any jokes about bow ow ow ow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! if u don't know what i mean don't ask anyways get this cd you won't regret it
2,Let's Get Something Straight...,"A kid makes a song for the Big Momma's House soundtrack... cute and all, but his ""rap"" career should've stopped there. Now he has a whole album out? Whether you see it now or not, this kid is just another Chi-Ali."
1,One Word : HORRIBLE,"I still can't believe that my aunt got me this album. I never wanted this album and she still got it. The only good song on the album is ""Bow Wow [That's My Name]."" The rest of the album is fillers. I suggest that anyone who got this album, throw it in the ...because it's not worth your $... that you spent on the CD."
4,Bigger Than Bigfoot,"These oversized, giant figures are by and large very well done - they're very sturdy and well sculpted. Again, my only disappointment is the lack of holes in the feet or a base to support the figure. I just discovered that there's a chase ""snowbird"" white sasquatch. Sounds cool."
2,Dumbded down,"I have never before purchased a ""For Dummies"" book and I wish I hadn't purchased this one. Someone had recommended it to me and the subject seemed rather difficult, so I decided to give it a try. It is what it says it is, I'll give it that. I find it annoying to read. Many statements are repeated over and over, and it is simplified to the point that I have to skip pages at some points. It does provide a very simplistic look at Kabbalah, but I can't help but think that a different book would have served me better. The author attributes the Kabbalah as being totally Jewish. I am new to the subject, but from what I have gathered from other sources, the Jews adopted the Kabbalah...they did not create it. I was also thrown by the many references to ""God."" I don't think of the divine in terms of the word ""God."" Maybe I should stick to my Taoist studies."
2,Quality is not great-,"Japanese Sake Set/ red.black ltrI purchased 2 Saki sets from this seller- The red with black lettering was poorly made- the lettering does not appear. The black with white lettering is not great either, but much better than the red one."
3,Not as good as the old ones.,"I purchased this for my grandchildren, remembering how beautiful the kaleidoscope was I had as a child. However, the cut-out plastic shapes inside were disappointing and cheap looking. My grandchildren gave it a look (I have 5 between the ages of 8 mos. to 5-years old) and then handed it back without comment. Unfortunately, they see so many beautifully colored graphics on TV, this toy doesn't seem to hold their interest. The toy is durable only if you let little boys play with it while closely supervised, but that is not the toy's fault; little boys like to take things apart."
1,CRAP,"This album contains incredibly whiney, self-absorbed lyrics, elementary guitar riffs, barely mediocre bass lines, and vomit inducing piano melodies. Anyone who might even consider purchasing this collection of ""tummy-ache tunes"" had better rack one's brain in order to find the origin of stupidy and lack of good taste. Five For Fighting should take five (at least) to improve his pre-pubescent voice and musical talent (or lack thereof) and contemplate his undeserved fame."
4,Move over Dave!,"If you're tired of Dave Mathews, but like his style, check out Five For Fighting. This is just great music. It's not overly complex, but has such impressive lyrical content, that it is at times VERY poetic. And it has a nice beat. Pop-rock at its best!"
4,"A fresh, original voice","Comparisons to Dave Matthews Band abound and are also unjustified. FFF makes a strong case for originality with this multi-faceted release. Soaring vocals and power chords accompany sections of acoustic quiet and introspection. The single 'Superman' is OK, but many of the others shine brighter, noteably the first two tracks, 'Jainy', 'Out of Love', and 'The Last Great American', the latter being a beautiful acoustic number. One of the better discs I've heard in the last year or two. I'm looking forward to more from them. Recommended."
3,Good Fashion tips,"I just received this magazine through a special holiday promotion on Amazon. Although it took a little while to receive it, it was full of great fashion tips and trends. The interviews are also enjoyable. Good Mag."
1,Most words are on the cover,You don't get much more to read in the magazine. Just a collection of pictures and ads. It takes no more than 5 minutes from cover to cover. You couldn't even rely on this to waste some time.
4,A good alternative,"I read through some of the other customers' reviews here and I was downright surprised. In a day when most of the people areound me are reading Maxim (which seems to be nothing more than a childish Playboy wanna-be), I find great comfort in the fact that magazines like Details exist. I don't care if the magazine doesn't have pictures of semi-nude women on every page. I enjoy being able to flip from an article about a current political issue on one page, to an interview with John Cleese on the next, and then to a feature on how to deal with going gray early. Details does a better job of treating me as a whole person, not as a frat-boy ball of hormones.It may have a lot of ads, but probably no more than GQ. I paid [$$$] for my subscription, so I'm not going to complain."
3,Huh?,"This movie started out to be really good but,lost steam half way through.It left me wondering ""Where's the rest of the movie""."
2,Not the best abortion information,"I would not read this if you are looking for abortion information. It is a history book, and it may poison you to use these recipes."

4,"match making+ the Olsen twins= fun, fun and more fun!","Mach making! What next! I love this movie. It's the bomb! I like how they made a mistake and eventually, got everthing the way it should be by the end of the movie. Not that I think that they wouldn't have, I mean, come on it's the Olsen Twins. But, it's one of my favorite because their match making and their having fun witch is important if you ask me."
4,Made me examine my feelings about my own European ancestry.,"A good book, I think, is one that makes you think and question beyond its pages. Keith Richburg's Out of America led me to examine my feelings about my ""homeland,"" Ireland, a country many of my ancestors left during the Famine. Like Richburg, I expected to feel a bond - a semi-mystical one - with the contemporary Irish, and in fact I did during two vacation visits. Then I spent some time working on a project with British and Irish colleagues in rural Ireland and discovered, rather to my dismay, that I considerably more in common with the ""enemy"" British (and with urban Dubliners) than I did with Irish country people, who often seemed naive, a bit cruel, and superstitious."
1,False Journalism,"It is not simply a narrative of what he saw. The controversy arises when the writer constantly speaks in absolutes about Africa being hopeless. I also challenge everyone to think about the American Revolution and how bloody it was trying to break the shackles of British oppression, now compare that event with Africans trying to break the oppression of World funded Militia's and Dictators. A true unbiased journalist would have thought about the history of developed nations: American Revolution, Civil War, French Revolutions, the Two world Wars, Haitian Revolution etc. The writer's work clearly shows his bias."
4,Eichler Homes: Design for Living,Four stars. I love mid-century architecture and this will make a nice addition to anyone's collection of books on the subject. Nice photography of both interiors and exteriors of a broad assortment of Eichler homes with interesting commentary on the evolution of his ideas and ideals. Additional high marks for the insights into Eichler the builder and man thru the contributions of his son Ned.
5,Great rag!,"If you into gaming, into the latest PC tech info, like reviews of hardware rated 1 thru 10, chomp PC builds, get this rag. @ $12 bucks for 2 years its worth every penny"
1,Maximum Bozo,This is a magazine made of clowns! Bozo rules! I friendly advice to people is to get almost any other magazine. This one is completely lost.
4,A Hot Rod Magazine For Computers,"Like a hot rod magazine is not for every car owner, this magazine is mainly for people on the cutting-edge of PC computer performance, or who enjoy being a spectator to it (essentially, computer drag races - I'm in this latter class.) It's well laid-out and fun to read. I recommend it - you'll always learn something."
5,The best PC magazine,"I have read them all, and for me, this is the best one. I look so forward to it coming in the mail, that I end up reading it in one sitting when it finally arrives. Then I spend the rest of the month rereading it & wishing that the next month's would get here sooner. Great compaisons & reviews that are concise & to the point. If I want more info, I can go to their website & get more in-depth. And then there is the disk with programs to try. Yes, I could download the files on my own, but the convenience of having the collection at my fingertips is very valuable to me."
5,Great PC tech magazine,"I've been looking for a great PC hobbyist magazine for a while and Maximum PC fits the bill nicely. While other so-called PC magazines are focusing more and more on consumer electronics, Maximum PC provides in-depth reporting on cutting-edge PC tech for the hobbyist trying to get the most out of their PC. It's not just for gamers, either. I look forward to my issue every month."
4,Some of the articles are pretty deep but still worth it.,"I've subscribed for years. The gold box price is better than I've seen elsewhere. I'm pretty up on tech stuff, but some of the articles go over my head. The articles have a bit of edge at times, but that's not necessarily bad. They will outline products that you won't find in mainline PC magazines, and give some deeper tips not seen elsewhere. I've never built a computer and am not a gamer, but knowing what the cutting edge is helps me put the mainline products in perspective. If you do build computers, put in a lot of improvements, or do a lot of gaming, this magazine is for you. For non-gamers/less intense people, there are also columns like on privacy, articles on windows tips and multimedia, reviews on software/hardware (although as commented on earlier, they do have more ads it seems in the magazine and their website has more reviews). Worth the price to try today for a year."
1,Watch the auto-renew...pretty slick...sleezy?,"You'll receive a notice an auto-renew notice 9-months in advance of your subscription expiration, advising of credit card debit. Of course the auto-renew $$$ is 50% greater than your current subscription, and what you can get elsewhere.Specifically: ""To change your address or credit card for this auto-renewal order, or to cancel your subscription, please update your preferences for this order in your Subscription Manager.""....now I know the only option for cancel is SUBSCRIPTION, not AUTO-RENEWAL. Read the quoted statement carefully.So naturally you proceed to cancel the auto-renew through Amazon's subscription manager. Surprise.....they (Amazon/Future) also cancel the remainder of the current subscription...9-months worth.You now have to coordinate the expiration of the Amazon subscription, with the startup of your new subscription provider, if you don't want to overlap issues."
2,magazine leaves us short,"Maximum PC shorted us 5 issues out of 12. After sending them the proof of payment date, the start of the magazine, and the end of the magazine receipt, they didn't even bother to acknowledge the information. They just stopped sending the magazine. I wouldn't wasted my money on a magazine that will not complete its subscription to you."
5,The Magazine For True Computer User,"This magazine keep me inform with the new technologies that are in the works, and give me secrets on product that alright out now. This magazine has so much information that it can be use as resource in some cases. Overclocking,Recommendation for best computer parts(such as video cards,soundcard,memory)I recommend this magazine to anybody who plans to be computer professional or not."
2,Beware of missleading discription,"I haven't opened and viewed this video, so this review is based on the description and reason I returned it unopened.My grandson loves Elmo and Sesame Street but most of the ones I have are only 30 minutes playing time; For us, that is not enough. I was looking for some hour long videos to play for him at bedtime. I purchased three videos that the descriptions showed to be 60 minutes playing time. When I got the DVDs, each one of the DVD covers clearly stated that they were 30 minutes playing time. So I returned all three for refund."
1,Terrible Recording,"The sound quality is very, very substandard. I just saw Campbell perform at the Ann Arbor Folk Festival and this poorly recorded album does him no justice at all. Buy another version of a greatest hits collection."
4,"Buy it for the CD, people.","The CD is great, the dream analyses that I get from it are a marvel. . . . I'm sure the book is good too, but I never got I around to reading it. However, let me tell that buying the entire book, whether you're going to read it or not, is worth the price just for the CD if you interested in getting your dreams interpreted"
1,Worst cross-over album ever!,"This can't do! The singing is technically so deficient, and the interpretation so charmless that this must be, by far, the worst cross-over album ever released. No marks can be awarded to this abysmal attempt."
1,A party recording,"This kind of album may make a good party recording, when friends gather around of have a good laugh at how ludicrously bad singing can be. Otherwise, such a poorly produced album has little or no artistic value at all. I'll give it just one star."
1,I regret buying it,"I regret buying this CD very much!Not only is the selection of music uninteresting, the performance of the singer leaves much to be desired. It appears that the singer knows little or nothing about the different performance/musical styles and that his technique is an embarrassment, whether to the singer or the listener.Even my kids can't stand such poor singing and they beg me to stop playing the recording and give them some peace! Even they, who aren't exactly musically gifted, realise that the singing on this CD is of exceptionally low quality.I must therefore reiterate that I regret having purchased this CD."
5,Watson brings joy and pleasure on every track,"Russell Watson sings each song, making it his own. To tell the truth, Watson simply has a voice and technique to perform such demanding kind of music. He excels on with each attempt on each track. A fantastic recording which can bring more pleasure and joy to every listener. Highly recommended."
5,World-class caliber singer,"Watson once again proves he is a world-class caliber artist, and will crack the American market wide open with his innovative style and a return to uncomplicated themes, both of which the US has been seeking for awhile.This is his second US release, but those who already know Watson's blend of Pop, rock and Classical influences will be able to hear his vocal progression on this album.Fans of the English and New Zealand releases, will appreciate this album even more, due to improved song selection and a clear, solid voice."
5,One of the great artists!,"I can think of no album of classical or popular music that approaches let alone accomplishes what this one does. This time out, Watson does his usual mix of classical and pop ""theme"" albums but introduces new ""pop"" voices. Again, this mix of popular and classical songs, makes it easier for the general public to listen and understand classical music.Incredibly, popular music enters the aesthetic realm of the tragic and elegaic, expressing mature emotions usually associated with poets such as Shakespeare, Keats, etc. The album stands both as a testimony to the power and depth of the common popular song as well as another crowning achievement of introducing classical songs by one the greatest artists of our lifetime."
5,You won't be disappointed!,"This is classic Russell Watson. I can't really pick a favorite song on the disc, they're all wonderful. Each has a different song style, but they have that certain Watson signature you can't replace. ""Bohemian Rhapsody""is a stroke of genius. As is ""Is Nothing Sacred"". It's all very easy to listen to, especially the operatic arias, presented in his usual refreshing and uncomplicated package. If you've never heard any other Watson CD, try this one. You won't be disappointed!"
1,Unacceptable,"Even after making allowances for the decline in music standards in recent years, this recording is still far from acceptable.The standard of the singing is just so bad that the music has been utterly spoilt. It is even more maddening that the singer and his record company are promoting such a kind of singing and calling it good! That's certainly going too far!I'm terribly disappointed after listening to this album, which shouldn't have been passed for release in the first place. I'd really want to have my money back if that's at all possible.Nevertheless, I've learnt to be more clever next time. I've also learnt to be more skeptical of all those exaggerated words of praise that I've heard, whatever they're about..."
1,I don't like this CD,"How can one enjoy a vocal CD if the singer cannot even sing a single phrase correctly? Furthermore, I don't find the singer's voice to be of any great quality. On the contrary, his timbre is dry and his voice becomes constricted from the middle register up.I think this CD can be good demonstration on how NOT to sing. As such, it will be of great help to students of the voice. However, to the general music lover, this recording can bring little pleasure for the singing is substandard."
1,Can't compete with Bocelli and others,"The substandard singing of Russell Watson certainly cannot compete with the glorious singing of Andrea Bocelli, who has a better voice as well as a complete mastery of vocal technique.Watson also cannot compete with Safina or Frangoulis as both these artists also sing with more skill have more powerful voices.Watson can't compare with Groban as Groban is a much more communicative singer.Why should one buy this album if there're much better things on offer in record stores?"
1,Russell Watson sings,"And what a terrible singer he is! Watson can't even sustain a note securely to its full measure. Much of the singing her amounts of a form of musical cheating. Listeners are thus unable to appreciate the full beauty of the music, which, in Watson's haphazard delivery, resembles mere tunes."
4,Versatile Singer,Russell Watson has an incredible voice range & a very versatile singer. He even made me appreciate opera!
1,Over-rated,"This album has been much too over-rated. If we concentrate on the singing, there is practically nothing that Russell Watson can boast about. The voice is of an ordinary quality, the range and volume are small, and it is not flexible enough. There is also no style in the singing - Watson marches through every song in the same unvaried manner. Unless you're a fan of the more boring performance style, I'm sure that such a kind of album can only be viewed as totally unsatisfactory."
1,Incompetent singing,"Many of the songs on this recording is good music. Unfortunately, everything is spoilt by the bad singing of Russell Watson. His clumsy and technically defective performances ruin each and every track. I don't find anything enjoyable here."
1,Unbelievably bad,"This recording is unbelievably bad, especially as regards the singing. Mr Russell Watson may have some talent in marketing his recording. But he certainly is not a singer of any talent. His voice is of unexceptional quality and he doesn't even know how to sing properly. As a result, his phrasing is choppy, his pitch variable and there's no even a semblance of musical style in his bland interpretations. Acutely disappointing!"
1,Uncommunicative singing,"The singing one this recording is uncommunicative. It seems that the singer, Russell Watson, has not bothered to understand the words and the setting of each song. Or else he wouldn't have sung each and every one of them with the same kind of voice and the same kind of feeling. Such evidence does point to the fact that Russell Watson is not a gifted song interpreter.As far as technical matters are concerned, I see that some others have already listed out the defects in a very convincing manner. I don't think I can do better. But I hope Russell Watson can find some time to brush up his singing skills and, above all, try to sing with more feeling and with a heart. That, instead of those exaggerated hypes, will serve him and music better, supposing that he indeed is a singer who cares about music."
1,No match for Frangoulis and Safina,"In the world of cross-over, Russell Watson just can't be compared to those really talented performers like Frangoulis and Safina. Watson's fame is the result of hype. He simply can't sing well. Listen to the recordings of Frangoulis and Safina and you'll at once notice what is lacking in Watson's singing."
1,Poor singing,"The singing on this cd is poor to the point that I can't help listening to it again. I also can't recommend it to anyone, even for those who have little experience in music appreciation.Russell Watson, on this cd, croaks his way throug the music, often simplified to cater for the low level technique of the singer. It's almost a parody of how the music should ideally be sung."
1,Don't like it,"It's perhaps my personal opinion, but I don't like this album. The singing is unacceptably bad. Don't understand how this cd can be released to the public."
1,Disappointing encore,"This encore album is disappointing, for Russell Watson's performances are completely uninspiring. He sings most of the songs in a forced and graceless manner, glossing over the many finer points of interpretation."
1,Uncommunicative singing,"Russell Watson's singing is so uncommunicative! How can he claim to be a ""people's tenor"" when he sings in such a charmless manner?I don't mind any technical defects of Russell Watson which some others claim that he has. But I'm really annoyed when the singing does not care to invest his singing with feeling. Watson doesn't seem to understand what he is singing - he merely produces the sound. Can this be termed good singing? I don't think so."
1,Wretched singing in a disappointing album,"After hearing so much about Russell Watson, this CD comes as a grave disappointment. Not only is Russell Watson's voice of unremarkable quality, much of the singing is, to put it bluntly, wretched. Such bad singing is not helped by the very square delivery and unimaginative interpretation by a singer who evidently still has much to learn.To release an album at this stage when the singer is not ready will do justice to neither the listener or the music."
1,Inexpressive singing,"This cd, which I recently bought, gave me goosebumps. The reason? It is so badly sung that I can't help feeling a shudder every time the singer makes an ugly sound, which, honestly, can be count in the hundreds within the course of this cd.I don't find the singing here expressive, too. In fact, it's plain, boring and lacks emotional variety. Just listen most other singers, whatever the field, and you can usually hear a large range of expression that what one is treated to here on this cd. It might have been a stone singing...That this cd and its predecessor can sell in such amounts denote a decline in the overall standard of music appreciation in our society and that something has gone very wrong with music education in the schools. Nevertheless, it's heartening to see that quite a few have managed to speak their minds (and also the truths and plain facts) about the singing here. Their views certianly sound convincing to me."
5,Enjoyed every single track,I enjoyed every bit of this CD. I can't say that for any other CD I own. That makes this a 5 Star CD for me.
5,Everything is right with Watson,"Everything seems to be right as regards the singing in this album. The notes are perfect, the style is appropriate and the interpretation is true to every song.The performances here are just absolute wonders of the music. Just listen to other singers perform them, and you'll realise at once you've missed something until you hear Watson's versions and his wonderful singing."
1,"Bocelli, Groban, Safina and Frangoulis are all better","Having heard Russell Watson's recordings as well as those by Bocelli, Groban, Safina and Frangoulis, I must say that Watson's attempts are the worst in the lot. This cd is therefore far less competitive than those produced by the aforementioned singers, who possess a better voice and a more secure technique.Other than a modern image, Russell Watson's doesn't have much to offer. Certainly not his singing. As there're so many excellent cross-over albums in the market, I don't think Russell Watson will be able to have a long singing career if he keeps on producing such low standard material."
1,"Watson is no Frangoulis, or Bocelli","I've listened to many recent recordings of cross-over singers. I just want to say that Russell Watson cannot match Maria Frangoulis at all. Not only is Watson much less handsome the Frangoulis, his voice and vocal skills are no match for Frangoulis, too.Likewise, Watson is no match for Bocelli, who has an excellent technique. Above all, Bocelli sings with great sincerity while Watson's singing is contrived.In conclusion, Frangoulis and Bocelli are real artists. Watson is not."
1,From bad to worse,"The singing of Russell Watson has, I'm afraid, gone from bad to worse.His first album, The Voice, also exposes his many vocal and stylistic defeats. Unfortunately, things declined further in this his 2nd album. Even the quality of his voice has deteriorated markedly.The performances on this album give no pleasure. One star."
1,Unworthy effort,I don't think this album should be released at full price.The singing is definitely bad. The singer is unable to grasp the difference in musical styles between the different numbers. It is a total disappointment.Such substandard stuff doesn't deserve to be sold at such a price. Or at any price.
1,Absolutely hellish singing,Can't imagine a more poorly performed vocal album.Russell Watson doesn't have a voice. He certainly has no technique. Style is alien to him. Charm he has little.A totally worthless album!
2,What happened here,"While I enjoyed his first album immensely, I was wondering what happened here. His voice and technique actually deteriorated from his first album. And his ""opera voice"" now sounds as though he was singing with his tongue hanging out of his mouth... terribly annoying. The only song I enjoyed as Va Pensiero and other compositions are just...annoying. The other duelist in the Prayer is just bad. Compared to Safina and Bocelli, this album doesn't stand a chance. If its not for Va Pensiero, I would have given this album a 1."
1,Simply not good enough,Watson's singing isn't good enough for the songs contained in this cd. His voice is too hoarse and constricted for those operatic arias. Makes unpleasant listening.
1,Stunningly bad!,I was stunned after listening to this recording. How can a commerical recording be so bad? I'm referring to the singing of Mr Watson. He has a weak voice of limited range. He can't sing the notes accurately. He has no sense of style.I think what Mr Watson can do is only to teach people how NOT to sing.
1,Wanton disregard of the rules of good singing,"This album is appalling in the sense that the singer, Russell Watson, has watonly disregarded almost all the rules of good singing AND then represents that his kind of singing is good and preferable to those who can singing 100 times better than him even in their bathrooms.Russell Watson's croaky, dimunitive, strained and dry voice is already a trial to the ears. Unfortunately, his insecure, clumsy, unemotional and defect ridden singing succeeds in driving away whatever pleasure that remains in the music.Never have I heard such a poor sung album. Never have I chanced upon such a bad singer. Buy this album at your peril. (Or you can listen to it first, when the above will immediately be apparant after a few bars of singing.)"
5,Russ is the best,"I am a much younger listener. Being 16 years old, I still feel so connected with this older type of music. It is relaxing when I study, and is just so beautiful that you can't help but love it. The song ""Where My Heart Will Take Me"" is one of my favorites! Russ is definitely one of the best!!!"
5,Unbelievable ability,"The magnificent version of Nella fantasia from the first Watson recording just blew me away. What a feast, then, to have his second CD beginning with Va pensiero, which sent shivers down my spine. Anyone who claims Watson has choppy voice or strains on his high notes should listen to Watson's O sole mio. For my money, no one sings E lucevan le stelle better than Watson.While I preferred the classical arias of the VOICE, there still are many highlights, notably an inspiring Ave Maria, a most alluring Pelagia's Song, and two I mentioned previously, the formidable O sole mio, and the dramatic E lucevan le stelle. Listening to Watson sing Where My Heart Will Take Me, you realize that this is what separates him from all other singers, the unbelievable ability to sing a pop tune as a pop singer and not with a classical voice. This is a most attractive album."
5,CD is exceptional!,"I have written a review for VOICE in the past because of the critical reviews that made no sense. Now I see the critics have converged en masse to Encore because the critical reviews have all but disappeared on the VOICE. What is it with these critics who must derive pleasure from criticizing Russell Watson on a weekly basis? Precious time should be better spent elsewhere.The critics are indirectly saying what fools we are for loving a terrible singer, Watson. I am somewhat insulted. Watson has a beautiful operatic voice, a wonderful classical voice, a swinging pop voice, and can sing rock with the best of them. I almost thought he was singing country music on one track. I believe this man can do even more than the Cds have shown and am hoping for more from him. This young man is talented and this CD is exceptional. Buy it!!"
1,From bad to worse,"This isn't a cd to be recommended as the singing is very substandard.The performance of Russell Waton seems to have gone from bad to worse, as judged from his 2 recordings. There's almost no technique and the sounds that he makes are quite terrifying. Nor has his singing any charm.One of the worst recordings that I've heard."
1,Bored by this recording,"I regret having bought this recording for I'm bored by it. The singing is uncommunicative and unimaginative. Sometimes, the singing voice even becomes strident.All my friends also don't think very higher of this recording. Some, in particular those who're good at singing, consider the singing here to be ridiculously substandard. A few said that the singer has unwittingly revealed his own shortcomings by attempting a program that is beyond his reach.Anyway, it's to me one of the most boring recordings that I've listened to."
5,Can sing any song anytime anywhere,"Russell Watson is quite an impressive singer.He exudes energy and vitality to all his songs and even, dramatically, (MATTINATA and E LUCEVAN LE STELLE). For a change of pace, he sings softly and gently in his beautiful rendition of YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL.Listening to Russell sing one song after another, you will immediately become aware that this is a talented singer who can sing any song any time anywhere.Spectacular!!! 5 Stars, definitely!!!"
1,Worst in the cross-over bunch,"Russell Watson is, in my view, the worst cross-over singer that I've heard. While the voices of Groban, Bocelli and Fangoulis have more lasting beautiful, I've become tired of Watson's monotonous tone pretty soon. Also, the others have a much better singing technique, which makes their performances more interesting, subtle and of lasting interest. Listening to Watson is just like drinking tap water. It gives you next to nothing."
1,Flawed singing all the way,"It's difficult to think of anything that is worse than this. The singing is badly flawed, and this can be easily heard in every song, and almost in every phrase.The shortness of breath and the insecurity in the higher notes are far too evident. More subtle defects include an inability to sing the music as written as well as a total disregard of the musical style in some of the songs.It's indeed unbelievably bad. Honestly, I don't think anyone who has the slightest musical integrity would make a recording that flawed. And I don't think any listener who has any minimum demand in music apprecation would give it more than 2 stars.For myself, this recording deserves only one."
1,One star recording,"I can only give this recording a single star as Russell Watson has simplified the music to such an extent that it amounts almost to cheating. If Russell Watson is indeed a versatile singer, as some of his fans have claimed, he should have the ability to deliver the music in accordance with the score. Unfortunately, his vocal inadequacies can't do justice to the music. As a result, he tranposes, trims, simplifies and tones down many things, rendering those great songs mere tunes for humming in the karaoke.Russell Watson has done great damage and injustice to the music that he sings. His influence in the musical scene can only be negative."
1,Shouldn't have encored,"Russell Watson and his record company shouldn't have produced this 2nd album. The first album is already a grave disappointment, I mean to genuine music lovers. Unfortunately, not only has Watson's singing not improved in the meantime, I has actually gone from bad to worse. The selection of music is also less interesting than the first album, and, other than the presentation, there's almost nothing to recommend in this new album, in particular in relation to artistic merits.This is an album which should never have seen the light of the day, and should best be forgotten."
5,Nobody does it better than Watson,"Having listened to most cross-overs releases of the past 5 years, I can say that this, this second album by Russell Watson, is by far the best of the batch.Here we can see how a singer with a tremendous voice, so much technique and a sense of style unmatched by anyone makes he songs he sings his own. The performances are technically superb and interpretative-wise so appealing. One of the best CDs. Ever!!"
3,Make up his mind already,"If I'm in the mood for operatic/classical, I'm just not in the mood for ""You Are So Beautiful."" I wish the guy would put just the operatic/classical music on one CD and the pop on another (which I wouldn't buy - he sounds like the rest of the pack). I thought I was listening to two different people . . . There's ""the VOICE,"" and then there's ""the voice."" He ought to blow off the pop and stick to his true strength - the VOICE."
5,Marvelous CD,The first record I ever heard of Russell Watson's and one of my absolute favorites. This is a complete departure from the kind of CDs I usually buy but it's a wonderful one.On this record is some of the most beautiful and thought provoking music I have ever heard.It is a true masterpiece that all Watson fans should own and music fans should listen to.It's marvelous.
1,A singer who can't sing,"The evidence is all here. Russell Watson is a singer who can't sing. He attempts to perform everything, but his performances betrays the fact that both his technique and interpretative abilities are not up to it.A poorly done album, one that does neither justice to the music nor to cross-over as a genre."
1,All hype no substance,"There's much hype surrounding Russell Watson. However, there's little substance in his singing, which proves to be abrasive and pretty unmusical. The singer still has much to learn before he can produce a decent recording. Rushing such a kind of substandard recording out into the market before the singer is even technically ready isn't a very responsible action by the record company."
1,A travesty of singing,"The performance of Russell Watson in this album is, honest to say, a travesty.Despite all those empty claims of Russell Watson being a ""fantastic"", ""marvellous"" or ""brilliant"" singer, what one hears in this album is a singer barely surviving in music that is clearly beyond his abilities to cope with.The voice of Russell Watson, which, truth to say, is of mediocre quality, already discloses quite a bit of wear and tear. His singing often lacks any sense of phrasing and dynamic variation. Whenever vocal agility is required, he dodges the challenge and simplifies the music. In the more strenuous moments, the sounds that he makes is truly distressing. This recording surely marks one of the lowest points in recording history...Needless to say, I don't like what I've heard. If Russell Watson is to make yet another recording, I do hope that he can do better. I just can't bear listening to yet another farce!"
4,Insightful!,"There's no reason to beat around the bush: This is not an objective history of Cisco. It is an unabashedly adulatory look at one of the most influential companies of the New Economy. If you're looking for a critical assessment of Cisco's business model and execution, look elsewhere. That does not mean that you should ignore Inside Cisco, however. On the contrary, we from getAbstract strongly recommend this book for its detailed dissection of Cisco's acquisition methodology, from its target identification and selection to integration and employee retention. Anyone in business would do well to read this book, study these processes and make them their own."
2,Reading and All That Jazz,"The delivery is acceptable, I received it within 10 days after ordering. However, the book misses lots of pages that the buyer should mention it for me to consider if I want to buy with that price or not. If I had time to order another one that I could receive before my class started, I would have sent it back.By the way, this is very good book for improving reading skills. The information is updated, and there are variety of readings that make reading class is more exciting. There are also many exercises to practice. I like this book."
5,A Brave Woman,"I read ""Kabloona"" several years ago and have reread it again twice. Jason not only could write well and make me experience her trip vicariously, she also had the ability to spur me into new and different experiences of my own. Although I have not braved the Arctic as she did, I have conquered my own little fears and challenges. My mother used to wonder why cancer only got the most wonderful, caring, creative people. My mother was right. Jason may not have lived to write book number two, but her energy and her passion have been a road map to women in at least two countries. Thanks for the trip, Victoria!"
3,Great for Frances Farmer fans.,"I found the book fascinating, as a great Frances Farmer fan. It's too bad, however, that there was not more about her later life- from 1950-1970. According to William Arnold, the author of ""Shadowland"", there are a lot of inaccuracies in the book; nevertheless, it is very interesting. I have four Frances Farmer videos- Come and Get It, Toast of New York, Son of Fury, and Rhythm on the Range, plus a tape of her This Is Your Life Program. I have also seen South of Pago Pago, but have not been able to find a video to buy. Does anyone know where I might get tapes of her other movies such as Exclusive and Ebb Tide?"
5,Makes a great gift!,"I received this as a gift and I have used it just about daily since. It is lightweight but in a pleasant way and cuts wonderfully. My only complaints are that I am sometimes afraid to use them because they have so many warnings about not cutting hard things (hard cheeses, nuts, etc) and not twisting/bending the blade. These are not things I do usually with any knife, but it still makes me feel paranoid/overly protective. Also they will chip if you accidentally hit the edges against anything like the sink, a dish, etc. I'm sure they would also break if you managed to hit them hard enough.They do cut so well though, very thin if you like, tomatoes, meats, etc."
3,Read it before you subscribe,"I am surprised at those who subscribed to Boston Magazine, which is always more or less the same, and then exclaimed with surprise at how it focuses on ""the elite"" and ""isn't the real Boston."" Didn't they look at it before they bought it?Boston Magazine is a frothy ad-filled city magazine with some fun features & a lot of fluff. Its ""Best of"" issue is widely read & the reviews can be useful but it is not a serious periodical. More of a provincial Vanity Fair.If that appeals to you, then subscribe."
4,Much better now,"The magazine has undergone some changes the past year or so - and it is MUCH better. The articles are more relevant, interesting and well written. The layout is more engaging. If you didn't like it in the past - I recommend taking another look at it."
4,your inner child of the past,it explains how a person parents himself as his parents did to him when he was a child. good information
5,A brilliant history of the future,"A superb Neo-Victorian speculative work of alternate history, which tackles issues of war and peace, nationalism, manifest destiny, and the veneration of History. The book is appropriately slow paced, being the memoir of Sir Robert Mayfair Bruce, who writes of the ascension to power of the 'new world's greatest hero' Lord Fitzpatrick. Bruce's story (and particularly that of his family) answers the question many people have in the face of great historical change, asking ""what can one person do to change anything?"" Combining steampunk elements, fictional intertextuality, and poignant moments of human emotion and grace, Theodore Judson has created a book that, while easy to put down, continues to beckon the reader to pick it back up. Highly recommended."
4,borders backings and bindings book,"I needed the book for a project.It arrived on timeUsed. some wear on the edges, but inside just rightSatisfied with the price"
5,WONDERFUL,"There is no way they could fit all the Lightfoot songs I like on four CDs I understand that, however the ones that are here are great. I love this collection. I have always been a Lightfoot fan since the very early 70's. The sound is good and he sings the original version on 99% of the tunes here. Gords Gold finds him re-recording a lot of the early stuff, these are the originals for the most part. Even with this set I still had to have the original albums that are out on CD now for the lost ones that didn't make it in this collection. ANYWAY what I am trying to say is, LOVE IT. You can't go wrong. There is NO ONE like Gordon Lightfoot."
5,Captain N Complete Series,Excellent quality. Loved it when I was young. Now my son can enjoy it. Non violent cartoons with alot of excitement. Really recommend this for parents who are concerned with the violence on tv.
1,A work of questionable integrity,"Thomas Hoving was sacked as director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. His integrity had become questionable in the eyes of scholars. He then wrote a number of popular-style money-spinning tell-all books, such as this one. Alas, Tutankhamun: The Untold Story, suffers from that same lack of integrity which critics saw in Hoving during his years at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In particular his charges against Howard Carter are trash, not backed up by evidence. This book is entertaining twaddle -- but twaddle primarily, and not reliable."
1,Really????,"To sum this movie up in three words: rude, crude and lewd! To call this a romantic comedy is a great stretch. As I am writing this review, I really can't recall any scenes that I thought were laugh out loud funny. I can, however, remember many scenes that were down right tacky. AND, it should have been rated R. The other reviews really let me down on this one."
4,Great Sermon,"Rev. Leo Daniels had a genuine passion for preaching. The Sermon, Lets Make a Deal, is a fine example of his ability to deliver a message."
1,Toxic,"This woman, BeBe Buell, is sick. She contradicts herself constantly in the book. She was a groupie, plain and simple. She was pretty enough, but not like she thought she was, not extraordinary. The part about Prince writing a song inspired by her had me rolling, laughing!!! Give me a break! He says ""baby"" not ""BeBe."" I doubt Elvis Costello was writing that many songs about her either. My god, this woman is deluded! I feel sorry for Todd and Liv."
3,Not as good as the 2005 release.,"I wasn't familiar with the story prior to watching the DVD. While this one is well done, I found it left some unfilled gaps. The 2005 release seemed to do a better job of providing that background.I did find it hard to follow the dialog with the various dialects of the characters, so I wanted to use subtitle. Alas! Subtitles are not enabled on DVDs in this series (BBC white covers). I switched from viewing the DVD via the component connection to viewing via the coax ""VCR"" connection. That allowed me to take advantage of the television's closed captioning capabilities. However, I had to sacrifice picture quality."
2,subtitles needed,I don't purchase any BBC period dramas if they do not have subtitles. Too many of the actors have accents Americans find difficult to understand so subtitles are necessary. Those that have them are fine; others I skip. I think this one does not have any.
4,surprisingly tasty - like kind I make,really tasty - surprisingly close to the one that I used to make from scratch. Needs to be really cold for best taste.
1,I'm surprised this book received such a high rating!,"I was very disappointed with this book. I bought it for my son, Nicholas, thinking he would be excited about a book with his name in it. The story is about a boy, who has very wealthy parents, who obviously care more about their money than anything else. When Nicholas is shipwrecked and lands, alone, on an island, he is happy to be away from his family. His parents worry at first and offer a reward to find him, but as time passes they spend the reward money on more jewels. How awful! I could just imagine what kind of message this would send to my sweet 5 year old son. A terrible book!"
4,Great Game for All!,Our family has worn out the old one and I was glad to find a newer version.Shipment arrived quickly.
3,Disappointment,This particular set is geared more for young children than for adults. I think that should be noted when purchasing the set.
4,Good multi-generational game,"Just spent Christmas with a dozen family members from 14 to 83 years old. Weather was bad so we were indoors most of the weekend. This was one game we all had a good time playing (4 at a time). Took some thought and some luck to win. The games took about 20 minutes each but if you played to 500 points, it took about an hour. Now I've come home and am buying a set for my own game closet."
5,Great Birthday gift for any family or child.,"This has been a family fav. for a very long time - now I like to give out as a gift for other family's to enjoy.The great thing is, the kids don't really think it's a learning game."
3,"Racko Shown in Picture IS NOT the Racko game they'll send you,,,unfortunately","I ordered the Racko game shown in the picture. Unfortunately, the RACKO game sent to me was made by a different company than the RACKO pictured and the one I thought I'd be getting. The one sent had none of the green colored cards that allow for players to switch cards with opponents, switch cards within their own rack, switch opponents cards and take extra turns. The one sent was BORING...only numbered cards, all the same colors with the potential to only be put in numerical order. The green cards are what makes this game fun. Beware...what you see IS NOT what you'll get. I sent the games back. If they had sent the one pictured, I'd have been happy. That's the original RACKO game."
2,as many reviewers said,"i didnt like this book, wich i bought with two other ring books which i liked. rings were unrealitic as somthing somone would wear once much less on a regular basis. they were more like display pieces than rings. i would not purchase this book if i knew what i do now."
5,Not all exceptional art is of European origin,"Having read this book years ago, its focus is not only on the art produced by persons of African origin, but the history of social attitudes toward persons of any color and how it sterotyped persons based on color. It is not just a history of the evolution of Black artists but the history of prejudice and opinions which had nothing to do with the talents of the artists. Art is a product of people and is not exclusive to a particular group. In order to develope not only a wider understanding of art as a whole, this book enlarges and fills in the ""missing links "" in the appreciation of art as a whole.To become aware of artists, where ever they come from this excelent book fills a void often overlooked by historians who have only focused on the artists of Europen and caucasian origin. Art, again, is a talent of people and not just a color."
1,Doesn't Last,"I had this item a little over a year when the fan motor stopped working. I doubt I have 50 hours on the unit, as I only turn it on as needed.It worked well when it worked, but I would look elsewhere for an air purifier. Maybe go with a namebrand."
2,Not Satisfied!,I purchased the Surround Air Multi-Tech XJ-3000C air purifier for every room in my home and I should have only ordered one item at once to see how they worked first! I cannot tell any difference in air quality and the machine is really loud!!! We have had no change in allergies either. I would have spend twice as much to have a better purifier.
3,More suitable for kids than adult,"It has its moments. It makes me laughs in some scenes. The problem with this kind of DVD's is it's monotonous. After 10 minutes, the same things are happenning again. For example, kids fell or hit by something etc..."
3,Stabelized Giotto Monopod,Monopod was a bit stronger and heavier construction than I had anticipated.. Mechanism works well and quick release is decent. There appears to be residual vibration when in the tripod/stableized mode before it settles down. It is more than adequate for my Canon 30D and 300 mm. Excellent height.
5,amazing,"I bought this album without hearing any of the songs, i read about them in a magazine. From the first listen i was hooked. they are one the most original and best bands out today"
2,Strum & Whine = Boredom,I made the mistake of buying this when it had 2 5-star reviews and because it was recommended in association with a CD by an artist I like. If you like accessible saturated music than you'll probably love this; I expect 80% of the 'crossover alternative' scene will think it's deep. It has emotions and stuff. But for me it was something that looked interesting but turned out to be as irritating and boring as being tied up and being forced to listen to coldplay. I'm giving mine away to a friend. The risks of being exploratory...
3,Good Album - but it gets old,"When I first heard this album I fell in love with it. But after a month of so of listening, our love affair faded. Now I can barely ever listen to it. I would still recommend buying it, but just know that it is not a timeless album. Arcade Fire is unique and interesting, and hopefully will come out with an album that has the same initial appeal, but something that will constantly keep you interested. I must add that ""Crown of Love"" is beatiful and one song I can still enjoy."
5,I loved this within seconds ... at the U2 Boston concert,"I was lucky enough to catch U2 in Boston on May 26th. As per usual, the Fleet Center were playing music over the PA before U2 took the stage. Then, the lights dimmed a bit, the U2 stage lights started to power up and over the PA came this amazing sound. I'd never heard the song, but I was stunned. At this point, the U2 stage lights were glowing red, and the song was getting louder and louder. I could not believe this sound! Turns out U2 are playing ""Wake Up"" by The Arcade Fire, just before they take the stage. Buy this CD now."
1,Melody is SUPPOSED to be an important aspect of music....,"....unless you think Lou Reed is god. In which case, you might think that this album is the bees knees that the critics have described it as. Yes, it's well packaged, laid out, presented..a nice little artistic theme throughout...but guess what? The music ISN'T GOOD!!!! Underneath all the pretention and hype, lie songs that just aren't good!! And vocals that are virtually unlistenable. I might not give this album only 1 star, because some of the intstumental aspects of a few tunes are cool, but there are so many glowing reviews from the sheeple on Amazon that SOMEONE needs to give the potential buyer a friggin' reality check. This album is #14 on Amazon? THIS ALBUM IS #14 ON AMAZON!!!!! Proves how easily so many are swayed. Open your ears, wash the residue of the Pitchfork review out of you sponge like brain, and listen to the CLIPS for GOODNESS SAKE before buying this."
1,Bland.....Bland.....Bland......Bland,"If this is what passes for Indie music today, the scene is in for a world of hurt. My god is this horrible. This album gets a lot of hype from people who have yet to see their manhood drop. It'll come someday, but please don't fluff this album. Whiny, pretentious, even geigh. If you want to see some real Canadian filth, watch Canadian Bacon. RIP John Candy...I wish you would of taken these guys out when you had the chance."
2,Over-rated indie fluff.,"Funeral is by no means a completely bad album; it has catchy instrumentation, off-key vocals, and almost-insightful lyrics. They've got the haircuts, they've got the psuedo-intellectualism, but they definitely don't have the soul it takes to be distinguishable among the sea of modern indie pop pleasantries. I might have given it three or four stars, but the unwavering praise on this page made me a bit less forgiving.The only tracks I really enjoyed were the first one, because the lyrics provided excellent imagery, and the last one, because of the female vocalist's great voice, and because I could go and put something else on without having to experience the resounding thought created by a truly significant album. :)"
3,"Best album of 2004? Uh, that'd be a big ""NO""","I think it's rather telling anytime critics spend more time in their reviews rehashing an album's backstory than actually reviewing the songs themselves. This is a promising debut, no doubt, but a few of the songs on this album are downright clunkers (If ""Crown of Love"" was meant as a satire, it'd be pretty clever, but I think they're actually sincere, unfortunately!), and the rest are nothing to wet yourself over. It's a good sign that the band does seem musically ambitious, and I look forward to hearing their follow up, but there's at least twenty other indie albums of 2004 that are at least as good if not better than this one."
5,Worth the hype,"Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant. I thought for sure that this album couldn't live up to the hype, but it most certainly exceeds, if anything. When I listen to it, I just want to get up and jump around, or conquer the world I'm not sure which. Energizing, positive without being smarmy... BRILLIANT!"
2,blah,"I have given this album at least 6 tries. The songs are jst weak. I suppose i ""should"" like it, and maybe the next one will be good, but I'm not impressed"
3,"sorry, too churchy...","for some reasons, this album reminds me a lot for those sounds you hear in church, which pretty much they all tend to repetitive and absolutely lacking personal emotion and intention the whole way. Not my cake but could work for some others. I sold it back in half price right the next day."
4,Great album but . . .,". . . it doesn't capture the energy they have live. They were playing so hard I expected instruments to break or one of them to drop dead, and they were only the opening act.Buy the album, and try to see them live!"
2,"""ch"" becomes ""c"", ""k"" becomes ""c"" dictionary","The excitement of having a dictionary authored by one of our respected scholars everporates as soon as one sees the ""dictionary"" itself. Pink cover, few pages, over two thirds of Igbo words ignored. Tiny lettesets, and the whole bit. Why?"
5,Minolta Case,I think this case is very well put together and functional. It fits the camera well and has a pocket for the extra battery and extra memory stick. I like the product very well. Fred
5,Specific tool for a specific job,"What can I say? I drink all day from a 64oz insulated mug with a built-in plastic straw, and after a while it gets pretty grungy inside.Wife figured I was going to die from contamination, so made me find something to clean it with. Found this on Amazon, reviews were good, so gave it a try. It's long, and cleans out the straw very good. If I had to make a recommendation it would be for the brush part to be a big bigger, in length and diameter, but as it is, it works great."
3,VERY thick and stiff wire,"I had hoped to use this on my stainless ""elbow"" straw. The end of the brush is sharp (be careful) and hits the inside curve of the stainless elbow and goes no further. I can brush from the other end of the straw but it leaves the curve of the straw untouched.I also wondered if the sharp end would scratch the inside of the 1/4 inch tubing, thus creating more places for ""dirt"" to accumulate.Because it is not cost effective to send it back, I'll find another use for this brush."
5,Exactly what I needed. The only wheel that works for chinchillas!,I have it hanging on the side of the cage to allow for the most space in the cage. Other wheels that may have cost more weren't as good as this one.
3,bent wire,"I had to return this product because it came with the wire so bent there was no way to straighen it out and it wouldn't spin. However, have bought this wheel before and the rats love it. But...I wouldn't buy it online ever again. This is a purchase to make at the store, where you can spin it to make sure it's not bent."
5,survivor the complete first season,we enjoy all survivors but didn't get to see them until halve way through. we are buying the first halve now .it is interesting to see them all again.
3,Survivor SEASON One,"I am a survivor nut, but by far this is most annoying one yet, lots of mean people on this show , and lots of sore losers.This one frankly got on my nerves. ! !"
1,"Jeff Probst, how do you keep it fresh?","Why or who would buy something like this...Unless you need something kinda heavy to smack someone with, or something to fire at with a powerful gun, you should stay the hell away from these. Anyone considering buying this--don't. Why support the numbing of American entertainment standards? If this truely is considered entertainment, and has sold more than five copies to people who AREN'T from the south, then I'm gonna go have one long cry...I'm serious.I once saw a lady driving down the freeway with one of those Survivor ""BUFFS"" wrapped tightly around her ignorant head. I PRAYED she was just a frilly robber or something, then I saw the ""SURVIVOR"" logo, and broke down...How did that one sell? Was she hooked in by the strong cheekbones of Jeff Probst? Doubtfully. No, I think she was just another victim of the Survivor craze. The very same craze that swept over Cujo and Old Yeller...Believe it. Don't buy these. Just don't."
1,Books I never received,"I would love to actually review the books I ordered, but I have never received them, even though I ordered them five (5) weeks ago!!! I will dispute the charge on my credit card today."
1,Falling in Love Again,"Like Power Passion and Murder, this movie was not her best, I would like to know where they found the pig for the hams in this movie. This was really a sleeper, bad acting, bad plot, somewhat confusing and a bit hard to follow, I rate this one about a quarter of a star."
3,not like illustration,"Don't expect to receive the same model you see in the photo. I received MSU0923, which is fatter but seems to work ok."
4,Like Reader's digest for Christians,"This is a great magazine with condensed versions of articles from a Christian perspective. Although it is for Roman Catholics, I am not one and find this magazine to be a great read. It frequently has articles about relationships with family and friends. It focuses on articles that will help the reader to live his/her faith each day."
3,La condition humaine,"Such a long, strange trip for Sandro, on many levels. My time spent with this book was worthwhile for its insights on humanity: where we have come from, where we may be going, and even our current status. I envy the author for his brevity of expression in the chapter titles--so much wisdom in so few words. And each chapter's opening paragraph offers a thoughtful truth to ponder, without even reading the explication embedded in the chapter remainder. Especially striking: the description of prison in Chapter 18 summarized all of life's frustrations in a few spare sentences.Guillermo, what a long, strange trip you've had since that grade school on the corner of Jackson and E. North Sts."
1,Horrible!!!!!,"... Read the fine print on your Dazzle video capture screen - you only get 50% of the resolution on your TV - this should be called ""Dazzling Fuzzy Pics Creator""!!! Bundle programs will only install one component at a time - leaving all the install boxes checked will cause your computer to crash because of install hangups. Will not ""build"" and ""burn"" your DVD at the same time. After much time and grief, the best analog to DVD movie conversion was a one frame per 3 seconds slide show (with the in between frames lost) and totally garbled sound. The program/hardware concept sounds great, which is why you will believe you ought to buy this RIGHT NOW. The program/hardware execution and results leave me furious that I did not read the reviews. There are other on-line stores with this product's reviews too, and they all sound like my review. I'm not ordinarily this stupid, but my impulse to buy this thing definitely was duuuuumb!!!"
1,Brought and returned....,"This is a great paperweight... Customer/technical service is terrible... Online troubleshooting is terrible... It plain just doesn't work... Even their message boards for pier technical-help agree, don't buy this..."
3,Good enough for the reader with a casual interest,"Alfred Guilaume has done well to write a relatively short book on Islam which is easy to read yet covers all major areas.However, the book would have been of greater value had it been referenced thoroughly. For example a lot of readers really would want to know the actual source of the satanic verses rather than take Guillaumes word that the people who transmitted the tradition 'were good muslims' and they had no reason to lie."
4,Man in the Wilderness/The Deadly Trackers,Man in the Wilderness: This is a well-made and thoughtful film without a moment of dullness. The widescreen DVD is of high quality.Deadly Trackers: This is a rather different and interesting Western with good acting and dialog. The picture quality of the widescreen DVD is average.
4,"Amusing, but definitely not mentall taxing","I bought this game because I found it somewhere dirt cheap, and was amused by the concept. It is a cute game, great for kids. The characters are little slow moving, no matter how fast a processor you have."
3,Good -- but slanted toward British usage,"On the positive side, this dictionary is very extensive and current, the paper is good, good margins, font not too small.The reason I give it just three stars is that it is written from the British point of view. This becomes a MAJOR problem when a German term is defined only with a colloquial British expression, often without even an indication that the term is British. E.g., Americans probably do not know that ""to flog"" in British English means to sell. In general, the quality of the definitions leaves much to be desired."
1,Broken after 1 month,I bought this for my granddaughter who is into unicorns right now. She loved her unicorn but after only a month the pole came apart from the head. We glued it back and soon after the gold piece cracked and it all fell off. She's so upset. I seems the head is just too heavy for the pole and gold colored wooden bracket that holds them together.Very disappointed because she is three and is very careful and caring of her toys. Now she just walks around with the head...not so good.I wouldn't recommend.Sad Grandma...
4,Beautiful Stick Unicorn w/adorable pony sound,My three year old daughter received this pony as a Christmas gift. She loves it. The only negative thing I can say is that the head is loose on the stick. I got her the other brown pony as well and that head is solidly on the stick. I am disappointed that it wobbles but so far it has satyed in tact despite hours of play.
2,A good idea that fell short,"I was really hoping for lots of great info when I ordered this book, but it wasn't there. LLL really needs to update this and include the specifics that moms need to nurse a preemie. This is not a book but a pamphlet. When it came in I devoured it in a short amount of time and couldn't believe that that was ""all there was"". I really expected more of a LLL publication and was very disappointed, however, the info it did have was good and accurate, there just wasn't enough of it."
4,I'm gettin to it.,it is my task to really get into this self study course. The product introductory reads well. I excited about all the other items purchased for my Kindle and have not got around to this. Amazon keep putting the excellent products. Thank you.
2,"Filthy, absolutely filthy.","Arcadi Volodos has a very impressive technique, and that's about all I can say in his favour. He plays the concerto with a naive, cliched and vapid expressive vocabulary, complimented by James Levine's dull and affected orchestral accompanent. Tender passages are played with predictably conventional phrasing, the louder ones with vacuous, dry aggression. For this piece, try Ashkenazy/Haitink or Horowitz/Reiner - their depths of feeling are coupled with extraordinary musicianship and a broad, highly lucid vision."
4,Good price! Fast shipping of first issue,"Well, I thought it would have a lot of recipes in it, but it turned out there were only a few towards the end of the magazine. But, they have pretty crafty and creative ideas that can inspire your own products.The Amazon price for the magazine is really cheap! And i got it a 2 weeks early of expected delivery. I would recommend it to others for the Amazon price!"
1,Country Living Magazine,"I did not recieved my first issue of Country Living yet. I ordered it in August.As of today October 21st, I still have not gotten my magazine Country Living. Please let me know the status of my subscription."
3,Haven't received yet,"I ordered this on 11/9/10 and still haven't received it on 12/11/10. I used to get this magazine and loved it.I would give it 5 stars, but due to the fact it's been a month and I haven't received an issue I'll give it 3. Not sure why it takes so long to receive a magazine.C Traynor"
4,me time,love the magazine...lots of good articles and recipes and household tips....not one of those mags filled with advertisements and few articles of interest. will continue to enjoy country living.
1,Traditional Values???,"I was greatly disappointed with this magazine because it continued to highlight immoral lifestyles and relationships that are highly controversial and go against traditional American and Biblical values. The editors have voiced their disagreement with my values and are highly opposed to those who share my stance and who have voiced their opinions to the editors as well. The editors are pushing the homosexual lifestyle by printing photos of the ""couple"" and have expressed their opposition to those who do not approve or accept that lifestyle as moral and normal."
1,Auto-renewal at almost double the Amazon price/no way to contact,"Originally subscribed directly with Hearst. Their Continuous Services Program guarantees automatic renewal at the lowest rate. Well I just received a bill for $21.97 FOR ONE YEAR. The Amazon renewal price is $12.00. Unfortunately I had already submitted a credit card payment for the higher amount. I went to their Customer Service Center on the website and there is no way to contact them regarding this problem. I am tempted to cancel my subscription in order to be able to take advantage of the Amazon rate; but I see too many reviews where the cancellation didn't happen. What kind of publisher has no way to send an email to customer service???HEARST PUBLISHING IF YOU READ THESE REVIEWS PLEASE ENABLE YOUR WEBSITE FOR EMAIL CONTACT WITH CUSTOMER SERVICE. IF YOU WANT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS DIRECTLY, MY ACCOUNT NUMBER IS 644602559."
2,Auto-renewal,"When I first got an email telling me my auto-renewal was ready, it said the price would be $8. But when I committed, it said the price was $12. Kindof a ripoff."
1,Not What I Expected....,Country Living Magazine I love country decorating and also love cottage design. This magazine is not what I hoped for.
3,country living,To much advertising. Most of the pages are advertising for medical ads not one page but two complete pages. I do not want to read that in a magazine. Will not renew next year.
4,"Loved it then, love it now.","I used to get Country Living Magazine many years ago but the subscription became too expensive. But for $5 a year, I'll take it. I gave it 4 stars because there is so much less content than years ago."
2,Couldn't use!,"I wanted to use these to keep my 2 and a half year old from constantly making a mess out of our dvd collection. Well, it didn't work on my tv stand. If your going to buy this MAKE SURE that the inside of your cabinet has a completely flat roof. Unlike the picture, the inside piece needs to be pushed back a couple of inches in order for the door to close all the way."
5,Best lock for keeping out small fingers and even dogs,"I tried the childproof locks that you reach in and press down to undo. Very low tech. Unfortunately my cupboards are not flush and built close together so I could barely reach in to press the lever down. I pinched my fingers every time. Also, the my dog would yank on the cupboard so hard, he could disengage it. (100lb smart black lab with a food issue). Once I put these on, my issues were gone. I had to use the screws for extra security but neither the kids nor the dog have gotten back into the cupboard and it looks great. I just keep the key on the fridge. Just did the rest of the cupboards"
2,Forget it if you have beveled cabinet doors,"My solid oak Woodmode cabinet doors are beveled a 1/2"" out of 3/4"". This had made it nearly impossible to install any sort of internal lock as the catch cannot be mounted flush to the cabinet face. Each cabinet door is turning out to be a 30 hour nightmare install with frequent re-drilling (the 1/4"" of tape certainly won't hold the catch). I'm restarting the project this Saturday using a pair of calipers to see if I get better results..."
2,Works well... at first.,"These are a really great idea, and worked well for a few weeks, but then the adhesive started failing. The parts literally just fell off of the cabinets. Then we screwed them into the cabinets, and it's been really hard to get them lined up correctly so that they ""catch"" and hold.If I had it to do over again, I'd skip these and find something else."
2,Too complicated to install on drawers,"The instructions to installing the tot loks are a classic of brevity that creates confusion. But the actual process -- for a drawer -- is a complicated mess. Installing this on a drawer required lying upside down, looking up into the darkness of the drawer slot, and trying to make a pencil mark through the tiny mark of the non-permeable paper you are asked to adhere in place on the underside of the drawer slot, and being sure not to be so much as 1/8 of an inch off or (a) the wouldn't fit in place and (b) I would risk drilling a hole back out through the front of the drawer I was trying to secure. It was so complicated, we gave up and are going to use the self-locking drawer locks. By the accounts of other reviews here, they work well on cabinets. We wouldn't know, because we gave up with the frustration of trying to install it properly on a drawer."
2,a total waste of money,"I got these locks because I didn't want my son pulling all the stuff out of the kitchen cabinets all the time. But they wouldn't work with the way our cabinets are built and when I put them in drawers, they were pretty easy to pull off with just the adhesive. And two broke when unsuspecting relatives gave them a tug thinking something was stuck in the drawer/cabinet.I am impressed by the mechanics of how they work, but in the end it was just easier to put the non-child-friendly items out of reach. HOWEVER, if you have a drill and the time to put them with screws - and your cabinets have the right size lip inside and the drawers are snug, it might really be what you're looking for. My advice - get a couple and see if they work before buying into the whole system, which is what I did."
4,Magnetic Locks,"This product installed fairly easily, and though it is annoying to have to grab a magnet every time I want to open a cabinet, they work really well. The problem to be aware of: if your cabinets have pieces of metal in them, that will interfere with the mechanism. Our cabinet has tiny metal staples? or something holding the decorative edging of each door to the main body of the door, and the magnetized metal (that is nearly impossible to see in the door) holds some of the locks open. Once we realized what was going on, we were able to buy double-stick tape, and re-position the locks to sit away from the metal. Once we did this, they worked just fine."
3,Won't work if your doors have a bit of a lip,"Our cabinets have a bit of a lip--the inside part of the door sits inside and the lip of the door laps over a bit. If you have cabinets like this, these locks will not work.I wish they had worked, because they would be much nicer to look at than the plastic kid locks."
1,Waste of money!,"This product is awful and should not even be sold. I bought the 4 locks from one supplier, and the lock key set from a different supplier. The package with the 4 locks recieved only 3 out of the 3 worked when installed on first day, then after about a week all the locks started not latching and locking properly. THe lock key set which included the key and 2 additional locks, worked longer than the 4 package of locks, however these 2 locks after about 2 weeks started malfunctioning and not latching/locking properly."
5,"Hamster or Hampster, they all rock!!!!!!!!!","I like er,i mean love-no wait... i llllooooooooooovvveeeee this album!!!!!!!!!!! The hampsterdance song is a classic!!! I think no wait, i KNOW ""Spin the Wheel"" is my fave!!!!! It talks about a girl who is secretly in love but it is hard for her to keep her feelings on the low. In the song, she keeps saying ""spin the wheel"" and if it lands right, then ""you'll be mine"". It is so sweet and romantic-yet catchy at the same time!!!"
4,hampster happy hardcore!,"I don't really have this CD..I'm planning on buying it though!! Man it's so corny but it rocks! IT's a lot like the happy hardcore I listen to all the time..I don't care if its about hampsters..they know how to rock it, you know?? =DD Bring this Jam to a party y0h! haha. bye byez"
4,As Good As The Best,"This book blends in to rhe rest of the storyline quite well. Shelley hasn't lost a thing in this writing, he perhaps has gotten my attention faster and with a continuity that makes me ready for his next offering. I just wish so many of his books were more available."
4,No 2nd release jinx here,"The only review on the new Pras album I have seen is in Entertainment Weekly. The album managed only a ""D"" basedon the school grade system. Personally, I think that review deserves a D-.This album is solid throughout with the exception of the Sean Paul track. That is only the case with myself because I do not care for his music or style. The standout tracks are Win, Lose or Draw, Haven't Found, Party's Ova, Mistakes & the Wyclef joint titled Angel's Wings I believe.The only complaint about the album is a slight magnetic pull of the lyrics towards Bono's political views. Pras has seemed to go the route of the Bono's followers in his views on life on this one."
3,Does not come with the cap shown in the picture,"FYI.I vote 3 stars to make it ""neutral"", as this is just an FYI post."
3,Creative Myth-making,"We are on the verge of a leap forward in understanding human consciousness. Prophet's channeled wisdom reflects an active mind at work. It is unprovable fiction, but it gives a narrative framework for understanding the elements of collective consciousness embedded in, as yet unidentified, aspects of mindful awareness. It's value will ultimately rest on what the consciousness explorers find when comparing it to other spiritual mythologies and the common themes and values that make for humaness."
5,Compact thorough guide,"This book was small enough to fit in a day-pack, but contained a lot of useful hiking information. It ranked the hikes on difficulty as well as letting you know how gratifying they were. It was nice to know what to expect along the way, and what to look forward to."
2,Hard to use,I have an older version of this hand held game but the buttons are starting to wear out from usage so I ordered this one. It's much smaller than the one I have and the buttons are extremely hard to push. Forget about speed with this one.
5,Word Fun,"The first day the game would freeze up and have to be restarted. When you restart the game, all the same puzzles come up again. But since then it's been working just fine. It can be played by yourself or with one other person. It can be timed or untimed. It is a fun word game and the small size makes it nice to carry around."
3,Good but tight,"I tried these on a pair of really worn shoes and they were loose to start with. After inserting these insoles, my shoe became really tight fit. Too tight for comfort. I guess these would fit good on those shoes where you can take out the old insoles"
2,Didn't work for me,"These interupted and delayed my walking schedule following hip replacement. I much prefer Spenco's ""Cross Trainers"" for superior heel cushion."
5,Great.,These are great inserts and the Men's 8-9 size fit my 9.5 Timberland boots perfectly. They're well made and comfortable.
3,Break off the edgecrusher,"This is a good DVD player. It has everything you need, at a price you can't beat. It's such a good buy. It's easy to set up and easy to use. A great first DVD player for anyone who is thinking of getting a DVD player. I wouldn't use it on my HDTV home theater, but if you just want something simple that looks good, this is the one. It has good sound and picture for the price. Haven't had any problems with it, what can I say I love it. It was cool.Big Truck"
2,Poor writing but many various examples,"Pros:- many examples- examples for various databases (Oracle, DBQ, etc.)Cons:- poorly written, wordy- difficult to read- gives examples for various databases, but each example doesnot have a version for each database -> if you want tolearn on a specificat database, you will have holes in theexamplesOverall: Poor book, would not recommend"
1,Extremely disappointing,"When I decided to learn Arabic on my own, this was the first resource I turned to. This was because I listened to the FSI's first CD on learning Spanish and thought it was very good. But this is much worse than the Spanish one, and I was very disappointed. The speaker never says anything slowly, and the explanations for some of the consonants aren't very good. In particular, the ayn consonant (which they symbolize by ""/9/"") should be discussed in detail. I do all right on this sound when it is associated with an ""a,"" but not when it's associated with an ""i"" (as in Iraq) or a ""u"" (as in Oman). It would be nice to hear a native speaker say a word with these sounds SLOWLY so that one can hear how to do it.Also, the Arabic script in the book is too fuzzy to make out.For conversation, Pimsleur, while not perfect, is much, much better."
5,System of a down unrealesed tracks but should contain more,"Finally, System of a down has released a lot of its great unrleased tracks and some on soundtracks such as streamline from the scorpion king soundtrack. All the tracks are great and continue with system of a down's great sound of playing hard and fast while having a sense of humar and a political edge. Most of the songs are that typical system of a down sound but steal this album has roulette and streamline which are softer songs which help to expand system of a down's sound such as the songs aerials from toxicity. The songs are all great as I said but should have contained more such as the song shame they did with old dirty bastard and their great cover of the legend of zelda theme songs (with lyrics song that only SOAD could do)."
5,system rocks!,"this is the best nu metal ever!!!!! SOAD is the only band you can rock out to and still laugh your ass of at the lyrics. I have bought every cd from them, even soundtracks that have them on it. BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!!!"
5,36,"Okay, besides this cd being my favorite at the moment (along with Toxicity and System of a Down), the reason the song 36 has its name is because if you line up every track from Suite-pea to Streamline (going through all 3 cds including the hidden track, Arto, on Toxicity) 36 is the 36th song they have done. Also, Serj is turning 36 this year. The lyrics make sense. Oh, don't steal this album...BUY IT!!!"
1,"even worse then thier first, one of the worst cds ever","dreadful, i cant believe i even listened to it, they scream, thats about it, yes the musicians are talented, and yes technically the singer is good, but all he does is scream!!!!! except for a few trimes, they also make the worst looks ever, they r all wierd looking, i cringe every time i hear it, i just hate it, im thought there could be one good song, instead of getting this get the new audioslave or Madonna, much better than this [stuff]"
5,Keep the System Alive,"System of a Down rocks out like you wish you could. I own all the System of a Down CD's. And if you don't like rock music. Don't buy the CD.,, I skateboard and all that I have got to do is pop in ""Steal This Album"" and turn to track two ""Inervisions."" And I am ready to skate. This album is a total buy."
4,Remodeled Bad Brains,"This band borrows heavy from Rage Against the Machine as many have noted, but even more so they borrow from the legendary band, Bad Brains. Both bands are better than SOAD, but SOAD are still good."
4,The Second Guess,"The first song through me for a loop... ""I was like...ummmmmm"" but then the rest of the CD followed and I was like ""Outstanding... Still going"" I even came to love that first song as strictly commical. These guys are the energizer bunnies of rock!"
3,Three stars for being lazy.,"Any band that releases a bunch of songs they rejected from their last album is just buying time.It pains me to give SOAD anything less than 5 stars but this collection is just not good. There are only 3 good tracks:I-E-A-I-A-I-O, Thetawaves, and Roulette. The streamline here is not as good as the version on the Scorpion King. Chic'n' sty , Boom,and Mr. Jack are still good, but frabnkly disappointments. Pick up Their first two albums before you even think of stealing this."
5,Pure genius.,"Serg Tankian is, without any doubt, the best male vocalist ever. The band itself is absolutely stunning. To even have SOAD consider this album nothing but rejected songs is asinine. What are you guys thinking?This is quite possibly the best works put together by SOAD. The lyrics (Boom) are incrediable and mesmerizing; their sick humor (butter's getting hard) is twisted and hilarious. The band offers everything someone would ever want from a band. Their cause is incrediable, and it's pure. They aren't fake. They aren't looking for attention. They're doing what they love, and doing what they do for a great cause. The Armenian folk sounds and themes included in their music makes it all the better, and all the more unique.There is no other band that can even touch the individuality, creativeness, or ingenius that System of a Down delivers. It's hard for me to even in words describe how much I admire these guys. I am proud to live in a country with patriots of freedom and life."
3,Repetative,"Don't get me wrong, System is one of the better rock groups out there today, but this album didn't do it for me. I bought the album hoping for a variety of musical talent as they showed in their previous album Toxicity, but all I got was this coverless, repetative compact disc. But I do enjoy listening to this CD every once in a while, but I do not think this CD is incredible."
4,A very good album considering they're leftovers,Ok the title might give you a wrong impression. They were leftover from toxcicity but dont dismiss this as a cash in for junk songs. They are all very good rivaling other system of a down songs. Many were left over becuase of the less significant lyrics than toxcicity's theme would have really allowed. More joke-y in some cases but still giving the good stuff you should expect from system of a down.
5,Daron Malakian is GOD!,"Wow, this is supposed to be a left overs album, most bands would kill to have songs like these on greatest hits albums. This album has a lot more mellower songs than Toxicity, there is a lot of acoustic guitar on this album. Daron Malakian is a genius, the guitar playing on Nu-Guns & Ego Brain blows me away. Serj is an amazing singer, he sounds amazing on Streamline. SOAD lyrics are amazing, I don't know what they mean but they sound impressive. SOAD are the saviours of music, don't steal this album...BUY IT!"
4,humidifier filter,"The filter came promptly and in good shape. It was not the size I expected, but I was able to make it work."
5,The best written book on US gold coins I have seen,"Despite little previous knowledge of this subject, I came away with profound respect for both these coins and the men who struck them. This book was extremely well written and done in a way that it appeals to all levels: rank amateur such as myself or professional coin dealer like my friend John who read the book at the same time I did."
3,Question: are the tracks complete in length?,"I have a Q for the owners: Lots of tracks are listed as ""as used in the movie"". Are those full versions of the composition? or just the small snippets that got used in the movie?Sometimes the movie might use just a few bars of the aria or concerto etc. It would be a shame if the CD had just that limited part of those pieces.How do the length of the pieces compare between this 2-CD set vs the 3-CD set?Thanks.PS: I have rated this 3 stars only because I have to rate this to post. If the tracks are of the complete length, then this would be a 5 star product!"
2,A JOKE,"ALRIGHT, WHAT IS BABY A.K.A. #1 STUNNA, AND NOW RIDICULOUSLY-SELF-DUBBED BIRDMAN THINKING? WHAT IS HAPPENING TO BACK WHEN CA$H MONEY RELIED ON ITS OWN ARTISTS? THE ONLY DECENT COLLABORATION IS WITH THE NEPTUNES. HONEST TO GOD, WHO WANTS TO LISTEN TO A SELF-PROCLAIMED ""STUNNA"" MAKING BIRD NOISES FOR AN ENTIRE ALBUM? I MUST GIVE PROPS TO JAZZE PHA THOUGH FOR EXCELLENT PRODUCTION. JAZZE PHA IS THE REASON ""DO THAT"" WILL BE APPRECIATED AS A SINGLE. I DON'T PREACH REAL HIP-HOP, BUT P. DIDDY AND BIRDMAN COMBINE TO DELIVER SOME OF THE MOST SENSELESS LINES I HAVE EVER HEARD. THE LYRICISM ON THIS ALBUM IS INCREDIBLY DULL. BABY NEEDS TO DROP THE WHOLE ""BIRDMAN"" CONCEPT AND REUNITE WITH MANNIE FRESH. CA$H MONEY NEEDS TO DISCOVER SOME NEW TALENT ON THEIR LABEL (NO PUN INTENDED LIL' WAYNE.) THEN MAYBE THEY WILL MAKE SOME LISTENABLE MUSIC."
3,exceptional,"WITH THIS CD BIRDMAN IS A GOOD NAME FOR IT. ON ABOUT EVERY SONG HE HAS A BIRD BACKGROUND. WHEN IT COMES TO SLICK TALKING AND PIMP WALKING BABY IS THE #1 STUNNA. THE BEST CUTS ARE BABY&CLIPSE;, BABY&CAMERON;, BABY&WEEZIE;, & SPINNING RIMZ WITH PETEY PABLO& T.I. OVERALL ITS WORTH BUYING BUT HE TALKING BOUT PUTTING OUT 5 VOLUMES OF BIRMAN AND A DUET CD WITH WEEZIE. 4 WORDS THAT HATERS NEED TO NO AND REAL PLAYAS DO IS DO WHAT YA DO.CASH MONEY STILL PIMP TIGHT BUT NOT 100%"
2,Disappointing!,"When the best tune on the album is a needless remake of something off your debut album, something is wrong. That is the case here and I have officially given up on King's X. The word ""lame"" kept coming to mind as I listened 3 or 4 times to this album trying to find some redeeming value. Compare this to ""Gretchen"" and you will know why I am dissappointed. Maybe my standards are too high for these guys but the album is a large bore. Sorry."
1,Disappointment...,"King's X has released several fantastic albums; this one, however, would be their worst. Their earlier stuff was by far better than this CD. The guitar on this album isn't as impressive, the vocals are mediocre, and the songs are stupid. It puts this picture in my mind like they just said, ""Well, we tried to be different and creative, now let's just be like everyone else."" This band was once creative and interesting, now (this album being the perfect exapmle) they are just trying to be like the average rock band -nothing special or interesting- just boring.So, don't waste your money on this album when you can buy something like ""Dogman"", ""Faith, Hope, Love"", ""Tape Head"", or anything they wrote in the late 80s or 90s."
1,Energy with no creativity,"This is far and away King's X's worst album. There is a ton of energy on it, but the band used absolutely no brains on any of these songs... if this was my first time hearing these guys, I'd think they had the IQ of your typical thrash band. And what in the world were they doing rehashing several songs whose original versions were FANTASTIC?! How can any King's X fan who heard the original ""Freedom"" not find this album to be an insult? What makes King's X albums so great is their ability to combine smarts with rock, but this album sounds more like a beginners' rock exercise. Nothing special going on here whatsoever."
5,Incredible album by a criminally underrated band...,"""Ogre Tones"" is an incredible album, yet I noticed the CD I have does not match the track listing Amazon has provided. Opposed to having 13 songs and the two promotional videos for ""Alone"" & ""If"", my CD only has the video for ""Alone"" but has an extra track entitled ""Goldilox (Reprise)"", which is essentially a re-recording of the song off their debut CD ""Out Of The Silent Planet"", with their more modern, crunchy guitar sounds. Not that I'm complaining, I was highly pleased with the new version, it's just odd that no one has mentioned it here."
3,Will never be the Same,"Ever since Gretchen goes to Nebraska, and Dogman Unfortunately I don't think Kings X will ever be the same. I dont know why. I have no idea why Doug opted to make a cd with Reb Beach(The Mob). Ive heard XV and seems mediocre at best. I wish they could get there old magic back but I dont see it happening."
3,Not what's shown,"The pen's are the BIC Atlantis, however the ""model"" of the pen is different than what's shown. I recieved a pen which is entirely blue except for the finger pad area which is white. The picture on Amazon shows a clear pen with blue finger pad area. What they are showing on Amazon is a new model of the same pen, but what you get is an old model with dried up ink."
3,Product is NOT what is pictured.,"I read some other reviews and hoped the image problem had been fixed. I agree with several of the reviews that say this product image is wrong. This may be an ok pen- its just not what I ordered. Unfortunately, the product photo is definitely not what I received from Amazon. We love the clear center pens in the photos but these Bic pens are not those. I saw the correct pens and correct image at walmart.com for $9.99 but went with Amazon for ease of order. I will order these elsewhwere next time."
2,Low absorbency,To call this product highly absorbent is a real stretch. It's one of those non-absorbent towel that smoothly skims the surface of your wet body but doesn't take much water with it.
2,"Tiny hoops and way, way overpriced",$70 !!!??? for these tiny hoops makes them extremely overpriced. Should they be put on sale for 1/2 price they'd still be too much.Just bought identical pairs of ( also .925 sterling) earrings for my nieces for $12.99 a pair from a local discount department store whose name begins with TJ.
4,this game rocks,"i played this game on Xbox at camp last year and this years version is just like it, only with a roster update. the main problem with this game is it is unrealistic (i had 6 block with the Truth in the 1st quarter and 160 points in the game)...This best camera angle is baseline low and when you start the game zoom all the way out, but the game rock if you dont really follow basketball very closely, it has pretty updated rosters, and the gamplay is good"
4,not as good as live 2000 but better than live 2001,"considering u can get from one end of the court to the other in 2 seconds flat, that kind of indicates where this game is headed. very fast paced, lots of monster jams! keep the difficulty level on all-star, the 3rd highest, for realistic AI and competition. the 1 on 1 feature is pretty cool also. online play is enjoyable but the 3 games i have played ended up in a blowout! but i was on the winning side during 2 of those contests, however. im borderline b/w giving this game 3 or 4 stars, but ill give it 4 because i enjoy playing it!"
4,Not worth buying (or really renting) but you have to see it...,"This is so clearly a poor man's E.T. and the most product placement you can see in a movie. There are more McDonalds commercials in this film than any single film I've seen, and that includes Christmas specials sponsored by McDonalds.Even ""Mac and Me"" carries those implications. But the creme de la creme is the big birthday party at McDonalds where everyone is dancing including the alien. Quite groovy.Again, watch it, but don't pay anything to watch it. We do have this on VHS so I may never see it again."
1,"Ed Wood, eat your heart out...","This is it. Oh my God, is this bad. Beyond description awful. This Coke and McDonald's commercial, I mean, ""movie"", rips off E.T., has atrocious acting, panders to an audience's sympathy for the handicapped, assuming you have the emotional depth of a Lilliputian puddle, and, most importantly, will make you laugh beyond belief. The dance scene in McDonald's has to be seen to be believed. Buy it now."
3,Ok I guess,It's great that I found a copy of this awesome childhood movie but it's full screen. That was the only downside.
4,Studio worthy headset a value,"I used this headset during nearly five years of weekly broadcasts from KRML AM/FM Carmel, California, when it was a jazz station (format changed in 2012). Sturdy, effective, comfortable, and dependable. I'd recommend it to anyone (broadcaster/recorder or not) as a real value."
5,One to read again and again. A sure five star book,"You will love this book. It is about a girl, named Neri, who can talk to a whale. She meets two boys named Jason and Brett. Then, a greedy scientist steals the whale. Now it's up to Neri,Jason,Brett and their friends to save the day"
5,SHE'S DONE IT AGAIN,"She's back with a new collection of house sounds and funky techno that will please any club people. She goes deeper into the club scene with this CD that has a few more different sounds. It allows you to almost picture yourself in a club where she's performing. I got to go to the launch party in Montreal and she is the best female DJ around. She has an incredible capacity to really be connected to her crowd. If you get an opportunity to see her live, do not hesitate."
1,Disgusting,I am used to diet alternatives so my expectations were not high. This is terrible. Save your money
5,Super resourceful book on parenting,"I came across this book at the library and found myself reading it from cover to cover more than once. It just makes sense! So many Mom's these days are cramming activities in their kids' schedules and trying to be their best friends. The text in this book is refreshing and reinforces the ideas that we had about parenting and that you can love your kids and want the best for them without allowing them to come first all the time. I am thrilled to have come across this and been able to take the time to read it. Do the same for yourself and have happy, non-spoiled kids that respect adults too."
1,The Hindus,"This book was listed as ""new"" and while it was, it had one of those annoying marker marks across the edge on one side. Why would anyone in their right mind do this to a hard cover book? Misleading of the supplier and presumably below Amazon's standards."
2,"Not a fan of Forbes, anymore","I subscribed to Forbes magazine for a year or two, and in general the content is good, but I cancelled my subscription for 3 reasons. (A) 33% of the pages are ALL advertisements - what a waste of space, (B) every magazine has 3 or 4 renewal postcards that fall out onto the floor as I read the magazine, and (B) the classifieds in the back are ""not of interest"" to any real business person. If you don't mind the ads and the fluff, then this magazine might be right for you! It's not for me. I give it 2 stars."
3,"Good business and investment reporting, could do with less politics","I learn quite a bit about what is going on in the business world from this magazine. It has stories about companies and business leaders from every industry imaginable, as well as plenty of information and advice about personal investing.I do wish they devoted a bit less space to conservative editorial content. I understand it's important to keep up to date on the workings of government, and how they will affect the world, but the very one-sided editorial pages tend to detract from the fairly balanced stories in the rest of the magazine."
2,"Great when it works, but....","Bought my first kit a little under a year ago, and it lasted for about 7 months--no problems whatsoever, and easy to install. Then it died. D-Link replaced it, but it takes awhile to go through their RMA process, so I bought a replacement set from Amazon and installed that, thinking that it wouldn't be such a bad idea to have a spare set anyway, especially after reading the reviews. Sure enough, after 6 weeks, the new set died as well. After an hour on the phone and getting cut off a few times, D-Link is now replacing my second set. Good thing I have a spare on hand. Unfortunately, I have to pay every time I send one of these things back. I'm starting to think that it may have been worthwhile to invest in the Amazon extended warranty on these."
