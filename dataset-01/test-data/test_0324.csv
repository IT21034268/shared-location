4,It does the job...,"Ok, I agree the little flap is a bit rickety, but if you're going to use it for Tivo (like me) then you're going to set it up once and then it's going to be sitting behind your Tivo for a year or more. So as long as you're somewhat careful (it is, after all, a piece of technology, not a football) then it will work fine for you. I've had mine for over a year now, and I've changed my configuration a few times with no problems.And by the way, mine is a version 2.0 and worked flawlessly with Tivo!For the price, a good product!"
2,"good form factor and speed, poor door design","I bought this adapter because I needed a second port on my laptop, and my coworkers had bought this model.After 6 weeks of gentle use (this stays in the office and doesn't travel), the door on my unit has come apart. It is a very poor design: the hinge on the plastic door (which is integral to holding the cable) is hinged on plastic tabs that wear.I would expect the design to be fragile, but not to be completely unusable in 6 weeks. Stay away..."
1,Unjustifiably poor design with no practical usage,"Short version: Don't waste your money on this adapter. Don't even consider it.Long version: Okay, so you would think that connecting your Ethernet wire to a USB hookup would work quickly and efficiently, right? Uh, not so fast. The Ethernet wire doesn't actually plug into the adapter; rather, it rests on the connection at a 45 degree angle. As if that's not bizarre enough, the whole contraption is held together by a hinged flap that has no desire to stay put together. The whole thing falls apart for any reason you can think of. I don't even know if the Internet connection it's meant to create is any good, quite frankly, since I can't get the adapter to stay in one piece. The design is asinine, and I'm returning this thing and getting a refund ASAP."
2,Nifty little tool but the door will break,"Its a nifty little tool and when I saw it at office depot; I bought it because i liked the design.however, the design gets in the way of functionality. The nifty little door on the back is very prone to breaking and mine broke when it fell on the ground (hey this is travel accessory; it is supposed to fall on the ground). it would not have been so bad if it was just the door that will break. The device is designed in such a way that there is no way to hold the ethernet wire in place if the door is broken !!so its now useless for me.please dont buy it. the door will break (and soon) and then it will be no good."
5,The best there is,"This has to be one of the best leather care products out there. I have used it on my leather coat, car seats and shoes. Does a fantastic job of softening and conditioning the leather. Even protects my leather shoes from salt damage here in the midwest, where sidewalk and street salt can really ruin a pair of leather shoes in no time. Would recommend to anyone."
5,Great for Golf gloves,triple the life of your golf gloves. Carry some in a refillable small hair spray bottle inside your golf bag. i use a zip lock bag to store glove after round. you won't believe how good it works to restore tackiness.
2,"Be aware: analine dyed, veg tanned leather","Be aware: using Lexol on analine dyed, veg tanned leather.Lexol removes the upper layer of this leather. After the threatment the color of the leather looks dull.Glossy russet brown changes in dull brown for instance. I even saw the cloth color.On analine dyed, veg tanned leather with a decal, this decal releases after threatment with Lexol."
5,Best Ever!,"I've tried other products on my leather furniture, but have never found anything that works as well as Lexol. Couldn't find it locally, so glad I found it on amazon. I bought the cleaner too, and now my couch and chairs look like new! love it!!"
5,leather cleaner,"Wow, I used this product on my car seats and dash and what a great job it does. I bought it for my saddle but since it said it was also good for car seats I thought I would try it...Excellent product."
2,Not particularly impressive,"I recently bought 2 pairs of Bruno Magli shoes @ $450/pair. I've never owned such expensive shoes before, so I decided I had better take care of them. In addition to a good shoe shine kit, I bought Lexol leather cleaner and this Lexol leather conditioner. I started by polishing the shoes and buffing them until they had a nice shine. Then I waited one day and applied the conditioner. I skipped the cleaning step, as I had never worn the shoes and they were spotless. After I applied the conditioner, the shoes looked dull and lifeless - all of the benefit of the shine and buff were gone. I buffed the shoes again with a clean cloth, but was unable to restore the shine. The leather might be well conditioned, but it sure doesn't look any better. Next time I will reverse the process: condition on day 1, shine and buff the following day, and see if this helps."
5,Great Product,"I have used Lexol products for many years. It keeps your leather goods looking new. Apply it to your leather shoes, boots or belts and wipe dry for a great luster."
4,Good leather conditioner.,"This is a very good conditioner. The product goes on smoothly, it is a little thicker than water so you have good control when applying it. It has helped keep the leather in our car soft, supple. It has not left any stain or discoloration. I highly recommend it."
5,This stuff works,"I was getting some shoes repaired and just happened to ask the Cobbler what he would recommend to redo my leather briefcase. He reached down under the counter and pulled up a container of Lexol. Well, I've had this briefcase for over 20 years and it had become dry and brittle. One treatment with Lexol and Ouila!!! I just rubbed it in with my hands. Now, it is Soft and pliable."
5,A wonderful product!,"Lexol Leather Conditioner is a great product! I had a good leather jacket in sorry need of reconditioning! We have a Shoe Repair shop in town, and the woman who runs it sold me my first bottle. She recommended rubbing it in with my fingers instead of having it absorbed into a wiping rag. My leather jacket is now brand new! And this stuff will work wonders on leather belts. Use it before the old leather belts crack, and the belts will probably last another 10 years! P.S. You should buy a liter cos the price is right, especially when eligible for Amazon's FREE Super Saver Shipping!"
3,Leather conditioner,Did not notice any difference after using this product. We cleaned the sofa as recommended and then conditioned as directed and no appreciable improvement. Maybe another application will prove helpful - we will see.
3,Nothing memorable,"This book was a pleasant read with some nice moments, some illogical or unrealistic scenes, but all in all, it was a typical romance novel: easy to read, easy to forget."
3,Don't kill yourself climbing over it!,"The best thing about this gate is seeing my baby sisters' faces pressed up against the mesh like they are pod people. The worst part about it is that because it's fabric it catches on other fabric, so if you are climbing over and your sock touches it, it will grab it and you will fall. So it's probably better you only use this gate in areas that you don't need to get in or out of."
3,"Good, but does chip your paint","We used this gate to block off our hallway with our first child, and it served it's purpose. We dragged it out with our second, but it doesn't allow our 3 yr old to climb over it to get to the bathroom, and after using it, I found numerous paint chips on the floor from where the pressure moldings were, which are not safe for baby."
4,Great gate for open doorways,This gate is low enough to step over. It is attractive enough to not disturb your decor. I would recommend. (Be sure to use a piece of paper between the end caps and your painted wall...or the paint will be on the end cap and not the wall when you take the gate down!)
3,Simple not so simple,This is the only gate we could find that would fit a 4'+ doorway.The system is simple but putting it up really requires 2 persons with average communication skills.Note that there is in fact not gate in it. It's more of a fence and adults are supposed to hop over it. If they can balance.
2,Not For An Active Child,"It is not a very strong pressure mount. If a child pulls up on the gate, it falls down. My son just lifts up a corner and the gate comes down. It is fine if your child will not pull up or shake, not for an active child!"
5,Wish they would make one like this but wider,This is the third Evenflo gate I ordered on Amazon.As my husband doesn't want to drill on the walls so this is my best choice.The only thing I wish is they would make a gate like this but 1 foot wider.
5,Extremely durable and simple to install!,"We've owned this gate for over 2 years. We originally bought it because I had a daycare in our home and we had a toddler boy of our own. We were trying to prepare our house to sell and needed the rest of the house to stay neat at all times. This gate was perfect! It did not require any hardware to install, it didn't mark up the walls, which we had freshly painted, and it came down quickly when we had a call for a showing.We've since moved and have had another baby. The gate is holding up beautifully and since it's adjustable we can use it in our new house. I even plan to buy another one to use in another large opening in our home."
5,Great Gate!,I love this baby gate! I couldn't find anything to fit the wide spaces in my living room that was not hardware mounted. I didn't want to put holes in my walls. This was the perfect find! I bought 3 gates for the wide entrance spaces in my living room. The gates were easy to assemble & are easy to use. They were also much cheaper here than other places I checked. I got 3 from Amazon with free shipping for the same price 2 of them would have been with other companies. I am very pleased with these baby gates. We're getting ready to go on vacation & the gates are going with us!
5,Another remarkable album from The Dolls,"Anyone who can rage for a better world in such gorgeous melodies and lyrics, it's almost your duty to listen to them. All the rhythms and notes sound totally new and totally comfortable at the same time. You'll never regret getting hooked on this, and their previous albums."
3,"Some good moments, some not so good","I can see why people like this music - it's better than a lot of what's out there. But personally I think they need to introduce more players in their band, more instruments. The vocalist does not have enough in her arsenal to carry the outfit with just a piano and drums, and the eccentricity is sometimes forced and abraisive to the point of being annoying. There are good moments, which other reviewers are not shy of pointing out, but there are some that just make you want to slap the singer."
3,Sounds new age but meek singer that can do better,"Felicia (the singer on this cd) sounds lovely and all, but I expected her to be asian when I heard this album. Her voice sounds compressed and forcibly so. Especially in track 1 Exordium: A Legend Foretold. This woman can sound deep and sensual, as you can hear in track 3, but continues to sheepishly constrict her voice to sound tiny and annoying. Its a shame, cause the lyrics and music are so enticing.Felicia does a lot of christian music as well. I guess this fits in well with restraining herself in more than her singing. I still listen to it since it provides a nice detour from Enya and the likes. However a european based album better have a strong european woman's voice on it when she chants and sings, not one who tries ever so hard to beat her own voice down to sound meek."
5,A Soothing Evening,"Neither ""Lord of the Rings"" nor completely Celtic, ""A Trilogy of Fantasy"" is a nice mix new age, cetlic, and fantasy music. Put it on in the background as you read or even game. Especially good for the price!"
4,"Trilogy of Fantasy, Part One","Firstly, I ordered this CD on a whim with two other LOTR related CDs. My first reaction to the CD was - this isn't celtic at all! Not close to Enya - per one reviewer and the language escaped me! Was it Elvish or Danish? On hearing it again, and again, I have grown to like it and compare it to the Bond Girls first CD. So, I recommend it for folks who want old world music with fantasy overtones but an hip, rockin' backbone."
5,An Amazing Novel,"This is one of the most amazing novels I've ever read! It's beautifully written and had me laughing and crying throughout. This is not your usual coming-of-age story. Set in the middle of a revolution in Liberia, it puts the inner struggle of a young American man against the backdrop of the hope and horror Man is capable of. I can't recommend it enough and think it will be ranked as one of the great novels of our time."
3,There is a newer version,"No problem with the book or the vendor, it just that there is a newer version than this. Ultimatly we took the online course so the book was helpful as a review tool."
2,Nothing special,Not very informative. Very little useful information. If you have ever had a dog before don't waist your money buying this book. There really is not much breed specific information in this book. I think I am going to return it.
1,CONFUSING AND NOT FACTS,I found that I disagreed with pretty much all that was written.Infact there is no CO creator GOD is GOD all bye himself.
2,Silent alarm,"I got this watch for my mother, who wanted a watch with a daily alarm to remind her to take her medication. The only problem is that the alarm is so quiet that it cannot be heard unless you put the watch to your ear at the time it is set for. An alarm watch with an inaudible alarm!"
4,"Basic, reliable","The ""Countdown timer"" is the ""selling point for this watch for me. Great when multitasking. Perfect for nurses and others with busy lives."
5,Lasted over 4 years,"This watch lasted over 4 years. (The band is not expansion, so I bought a Timex expansion band and changed it out.) Now the numbers are starting to fade, so I just bought another one and will put it on the expansion band. Granted, I do not use the alarm function much, but even so, 4 years is a long time for the battery to last! Very pleased. Nice small size for women."
3,It is OK,"I do not like having to fasten it when I wear it. The style is good, just wish it had an expandable band. Expandables are difficult to find in ladies watches that I like."
4,So 80's,I remember these when I was a kid. I bought a few for my friends 1980 benz since the Germans decided cars didn't require cup holders! .. work great though.
1,not as advertised,The cup holders don't slide in our windows -- they're too thick -- so they're useless to us.
5,Auto Cup Holders,The cup holders offer a safe area to place your drinks. No need to worry abouth the drink spilling onto the floor or seat. Easier to reach when you want a drink too. I also like dealing with Amazon.com. It is so easy.Chet <><
1,didn't work for me!!,"I don't know if it is my vehicle or the way this product is made......but it wouldn't stay hooked on the window. We use it to hold a cleaning bottle in the laundry room now, but definitely a waste of money for use in the car. :/"
4,Blumenthal grows as a writer...yet may need a good shrink...,"What's Wrong with Dorfman, Blumenthal's first novel was a mere trifle. Millard Fillmore is much better book, if not a great work of literature. Like Dorfman, we get another neurotic emotional stunted man, in Fussell. Still, he is embued with some very engaging quirks; esp. his love of Millard Fillmore. The characters, esp. Dr. Wang are odd and somewhat lovable. The revelations that come out as the novel moves on are often outrageous, but it all fits. The final twist is a fine one and I have to admit I loved the last paragraph. The map-makers rarely get hurt. Read it to find out that means."
3,The I.P.T.U. Review,"Everybody is freaking-out about ""the test"" in Ms. Malrky's class. the principal looses his wig over No.2 pencils. It is mass chaos because of the I.P.T.U. but in the end everybody figures out that ""the test"" wasn't even that hard. in my opinion this book is a major comedy about testing anxiety. I recommend this book for all ages."
5,The Real Story of Testing Mania,"Told from a child's perspective, this book tells a humorous and brutally honest story about the effects of high stakes testing in American schools. I use the book in my Educational Administration course on Instructional Leadership as an introduction to the topic of moving from testing hysteria to using assessments to promote learning. I love the book and recommend it for anyone who works in schools."
3,So So But,"They Only Come Out At Night is the genius of edgar held together with nuts and bolts. Plugged it in see Frankenstein hop. Shock treatment has good bits and pieces, but doesn't come close to They Only Come Out At Night. And this is a collection which is all over the place, but the man is always worth 3 stars"
3,casio watch,"I recently purchased the watch to use in the pool and other outdoor activities. I have been purchasing this type of watch for years, so I am suprised the watch scratched so easily - easy enough that I do not know when it happened, just noticed it one day. Otherwise, the watch is easy to read and use. I am expecting the watch to flood in the pool soon."
3,A little disappointed...,The watch suits my pupose but it is not totally what I expected. I am very pleased though that the battery has a 10 year life span...even if it last 5 it is worth it. Thanks.
3,"Watch is okay, band is not","I like this watch, except that I (not having read directions yet) cannot find a way to get it to read the day of the week with the date and a normal (not miltary) time showing. There is another mode you can push to show, but it lacks the day of the week, which I usually need. It may have instructions for this, but it does not appear so. I like the orange lite for night. I hate the rubber band and have replaced it with a metal one I also got thru Amazon. It makes it much more attractive and doesn't stink! I hate the rubber watch bands!"
2,My Ears Hurt,"Their ""I can see clearly now"" cover all that is worth having. Buy the MP3 and save your money."
4,Pure Fun Rock & Roll,"I remember toolin' around in my old Ford during my high school years listening to Mitch Ryder on my trusty ol' 8 track tape player. Recently I was reminiscing about that and decided I needed to hear Ryder's version of Little Latin Lupe Lu. So I logged on to Amazon and ordered ""Rev-Up: The Best of Mitch Ryder & the Detroit Wheels."" Within three days, I received the CD and was transported back to those relative carefree days listening to great pieces such as Jenny Take a Ride, Little Latin Lupe Lu, Devil in the Blue Dress and many others. And what made it even better was the fact that it was a high quality digital recording as opposed to that ""warbly"" old worn out 8 track tape.For anyone who likes good ol' time high energy Rock and Roll, I highly recommend this CD."
4,Very nice wireless TV headset,"I already have an older model Unisar TV Listener headset which I use for the Living Room TV when I'm up early or late and don't want to disturb anyone. Works well so I decided to get another one for the bedroom. This new one works equally well. What I'm a little concern about is the new model uses rechargeable batteries for the headset and tells you to not to leave the batteries charging and overcharge it. Since I don't use it often I'm worried the batteries might discharge all the way on a day when I want to use it. The older set I didn't have to worry about that. If the batteries were weak you could just replace them on the spot and be ready to go.Nevertheless, the sound quality is good and I'm happy"
4,unisar tv listener stereo,Mostly pleased with headphones. They were easy to hook up to tv. They are very comfortable to wear even if you do look like a martian. The sound is not as loud as I would like and the battery only charges for about 3 hrs listening on one charge. They were charged for the 16 hrs recommended.
1,Not worth the money at all,"I brought this item for my husband as a gift. The setup was simple but the results were terrible. The sound is more static than anything and in one instance, a radio station came though instead of the television. Also, unless you are sitting directly in front of the transmitter, all you will get is static. I turned my head just a few inches and it blasted my ears with static. I do not recommend this item at all."
2,Disappointing,"The production is nice, even if it is not what Strauss wanted, but the ""extras"" like the shots of Fleming and others sitting in the balconies and watching the opera are distracting and unnecessary.The singing is good from von Otter and Finley but Fleming's delivery is simply bland, with occasional irritating swooping and other strange (jazz?) mannerisms. Also, her acting is below par, the last scene of her stroking the chairs was ridiculous, and most of the time she seems only interested in looking pretty. I did not care for the costumes, especially the blue dress was odd and almost made Fleming look misshapen at certain angles (just look at the cover!). Overall the whole DVD was a disappointing production. The other Capriccio with te Kanawa is miles ahead."
2,Not what was advertised,"I'm yet to really use this phone, but I got it in the mail today and it only had 128mb memory with it, not 512 mb as advertised. And mine did not have itunes with it, just a digital media player that, as of yet, I have not been able to get to work with itunes on my computer. I hope I just had bad luck and everyone did not get what they didn't pay for."
1,Died within 3 month of purchase,"I purchased this phone to take with me on my move to South America. Worked well for about 1.5 months, then slowly started turning itself off, locking up and requiring me to remove the battery to restart, sometimes would say it had no SIM, etc... then the battery got to where it would not take a charge. The phone is in my closet and is now useless. A few months before this one, I purchased a similar phone for my wife (a RAZR) and it has done extremely well... I think it is a crap shoot when you buy one of these ""unlocked, no warranty"" phones... it may be great or it may be a... well... you know what."
2,Disposable phone,Might as well have gone into toys r us and gotten a better toy phone in there! The keypad started cracking not long after I got it. It sucks.
3,No iTunes and Poor Reception...Wireless Provider?,"I LOVED this phone, back when I had the Cingular L7. The screen is great, awesome features (If you are OK without iTunes). I bought this unlocked version to replace my lost/stolen Cingular Slivr L7. I had very poor reception with Cingular in the Twin Cities, MN. I still love it, but I have decided I need the reception most of all. Maybe T-Mobile is better with this phone?Please let me know :-)Great phone for staying in the city - Slim, great menus, bluetooth, speaker phone, great photos and a vibrant beautiful screen."
1,"Useless refurb junk, and you just know Spanish","So whoever allegedly ""quality checked"" these phones should be deported. The phone is in Spanish, and spent over an hour and still couldn't get it to English. The phones are refurb, not new. I got 2, and each comes with its own cosmetic defects.So I did managed to make and receive a few calls from my pure Spanish guessing. It's volume and signal strength is average at best.What a waste of money and time."
3,motorola phone,"the phone was in perfect shape , brand new but the ear phone were in poor shape not able to use it , wire wrapped up with electric tape and didn't work at all.thanks"
3,frustrating,"This phone being my first cell I love it. The only problems I have is that it slips out of my hands easily but it hasn been tough so far. Second thing I HATE about it is when I am on the phone when I lose a bar sometimes the phone will flash off and then turn back on, which can be exremly frustrating when trying to type a long text messege :|"
2,Good phone; just don't use it for text messaging unless you're fluent in Spanish.,"This is a good phone in terms of how reliable it is. Minimum of bells and whistles, solid construction and good reception. The thing about it that earned the 2 stars is that the predictive text system is so stupid it qualifies for its own DSM V diagnostic rating. Firstly, it's in Spanish. This is cool as the States has a large Spanish-speaking population. What's extremely *not* cool about it is that the Product Description fails to tell the buyer this. Also, the thing I liked about my previous phone was that I could teach the predictive text function just by adding new words to the correct spelling definitions, a must for anyone with a large vocabulary. Sadly, this phone does not retain the English spellings I repeatedly put into it.So if you're a Spanish speaker and you're looking for a good phone, this is the thing for you. If not, then go elsewhere."
2,this thing is great....when it works,"If it always worked like it was supposed to it would be awsome.Mine drops calls when It shows I have full reception.My calls break up and I have to hang up and call back before it will work.Sometimes when I try to unlock the keys to use the phone, The screen will go blank and the phone will not respond for about 15-20 seconds.Way to many little gimick features that just clutter up the user menu.My wifes is way worse than mine but she got water on hers so I won't complain about it."
2,NO! IF YOU ARE BUYING THIS PHONE FOR ITUNES,"If you are buying this phone for Itunes don't, all quadband Slvrs do Not come with Itunes which is the exact reason that I bought this phone, do not buy this phone if you are looking for Itunes. The phone also doesn't work with T-mobile Internet so I can't get on the internet from it, also you can not download anything such as skins, games, multimedia texts, videos pics... etc, I am very disapointed with the phone and have been trying to replace it with amazon for a long time but they really arn't much help. Be warned all that you are buying here is a phone that can send texts, talk, and take very poor pictures. This phone cannot browse the internet if you use a service other than Cingular, I really warn you not to buy this phone, you may as well burn you money."
4,A large variety of boy types,"Although I found the segments uneven, some were very good some good and some OK, I enjoyed the variety, something for everyone type approach, I especially liked the one segment (I forgot it's title) that had two boys in amorous positions and was dedicated to the 70's in feel and execution."
2,Poor quality of the printing.,The printing quality is very lousy. Some of the figures in this book can't even be seen properly.The printing seem to be from poor quality photocopying machine with not enough ink.
1,Disappointed,"Software associated with book is great, but book has poor printing, and ""scripts"" not associated with book were unavailable. I would not recommend getting this book this way, as there was no help from author when contacted."
2,Not so smooth,"I ordered this hanger in walnut finish10-Hole Scarf Hanger - Walnut. I noticed the roughness in the holes right away, so I sanded it with a fine grid sand paper and the hanger serves me fine now. The walnut finish was deep enough so sanding did not remove the walnut stain, but it is dull now. I should probably refinish it with a polyurethan spray as it is not waterproof now. This fix was cheaper than sending back the hanger. However, customers should not be expected to do such things on their own."
2,"Too much gross out, not enough substance.","While I enjoyed Little's novel ""The Store"" and thought his short stories in ""The Collection"" were okay, I was not really impressed with this book.In my opinion, Little goes for the gross out factor far more then he should. It seems like that's all there is to the story and it just becomes too much. I think he's kills off too many of the main character's friends and allies too. Again, too much.There's also a problem with the main character himself. I was halfway thru the book and was still asking myself why I should care what happens to the main character and his wife. Little just didn't do enough to get the reader emotionally invested in the story.Little definitely has skill as a writer and comes up with some original ideas. However, his execution of those ideas still leaves a lot to be desired. ""The Store"" shows that he's done it well once. It remains to be seen whether he can do it again. He definitely didn't pull it off with this book."
2,Like a bad B movie,"Starts out with potential, but eventually becomes unbelievable, even for fiction."
5,The Association,This is quite possibly the best book I have ever read and I have read alot of books. It was one of those rare times when I could not put a book down. I read it in 14 hours and I would have done it faster had it not been for the annoying things in life... It grabbed you from the first chapter. I think the best thing about it was that the characters were believable and you could definitely see yourself in their position. If you like horror definitely buy this book. Stephen King fans would definitely appreciate the style of Bentley Little.
2,Turns Ridiculous,"Mr. Little is a good writer. He keeps you wondering what's going to happen next. However, there comes a time in the book that ruins the story. It happens when the protagonist meets this guy at a party and then the next day sees him in the woods with four amputated limbs, his eye gouged out and tongue ripped out. What's the protagonist's reaction? Basically, ""Boy, that sure is creepy."" Now, imagine what your reaction would be if this happened to you. I think you would contact every law enforcement/emergency personnel up to the FBI and beyond. This is just one example of the many ridiculous actions/inactions of the protagonist in this book."
3,I Like Horror... But This One...,"Lately I've found few novels worth finishing. 'The Association' caught my interest early and held it for a good long time. But then, somewhere along the way, the latter third, Little seemed to lose his way and invent a stupid ending and stupid reason for the whole story.That was disappointing. It's my opinion that horror writers in general (King is an excellent example) are good at inventing a promising premise but then can't deliver an ending that makes the journey satisfying."
3,Mild thriller,"Though this story is well written, I thought it had a rather sluggish plot and the climax was rushed. I think the story could have been written better with a lot more horrific detail."
5,Gave me goosebumps!,I loved this book. I always read one and say it's my favorite until I read the next one. Carlene Thompson can tell one hell of a story. This one gave me goosebumps and made me afraid of my own house in the dark. I couldn't put it down. If you like her other books you will love it. And if you haven't read any you won't be able to resist reading more.
1,"Terrible solutions manual, DON'T PURCHASE!","As with most ""official"" solutions manuals, this one is pretty much junk. It contains ""full"" solutions to only odd problems, and those ""fully"" solutions generally skip steps, assume that you've already mastered the concepts (which you obviously haven't at this level), and on occasion, don't even solve problems the way the book recommends. Instead of purchasing a solutions manual for this DiffieEq book, I'd just recommend using Cramster. For free they've got AWESOME solutions to all odds which clearly explain what's going on, and for ten bucks a month they got you covered on all the evens as well. For some reason this site is not as well-known as it should be, but save yourself some money and headaches and check it out before buying crappy solutions manuals. Just Google ""Cramster"" and you'll be set!!"
3,Would have thought better of Casio,"The watch face is nice, but the straps are made of thin plastic. I'm afraid that if it get's snagged on something the strap will pop. Other than that the watch worked when I opened it, but as soon as I adjusted the time the watch stopped working. I had the watch all of 3 minutes, LOL. So either it may be the battery died or the watch was crap. Won't know until I change the battery. If I can figure out how to add a picture I will. In the picture note how the strap is almost the size of my laptop key. For the quality of the watch straps, I would think it should be cheaper."
3,Nice watch,Nice black watch. No frills. As expected and as presented. size also okay. would probably look nicer or more attractive in a brighter colour.
2,Arrived fast but battery wasn't working so had to return it,"The watch arrived incredibly fast and looked exactly like the picture - not fancy but good utilitarian watch. Unfortuantely, the battery wasn't working so I had to return the watch. Very disappointing."
2,5 dollars,"Its exactly a cheap watch, will do just that and as any casio durable. Dont expect anything more from it and it works."
5,Cheap and simple,"I got this watch for nursing school as I needed a watch with a second hand. I was so happy to find this one. A known brand, small, inconspicuous, CHEAP! It is perfect for my needs. I have very small wrists and the size is just right."
1,Doesn't work!!!!,I ordered this watch from Africa and had it come out with my children from Amercia who came for a visit. Was so disappointing to find that it doesn't even work. It is cute and what I wanted but who wants to wear a watch that doesn't work and I can't return it from here!
2,arrived in an OPEN bag :(,"I was very disappointed when the candy corn arrived in an OPEN bag. The box was the appropriate size, but they could have at least sealed the bag. That is unacceptable. Against my better judgment, I did go ahead and eat some of the candy corn. It was delicious. It would warrant 5 stars if not for the atrocious packaging."
2,Not as good as Brach's,"This is the hard, waxy candy corn that everybody knows and hates. The Brach's brand stuff is the candy corn that people actually like, and it's also a lot cheaper. I was disappointed when I realized this, as I had 10 pounds of the stuff, and we ended up using most of it in a food fight because it's not very good."
4,Big Dragon,"It's a big one.My wife and I saw this in an upscale toy store, our 1 year old twins instantly feel in love and just could not stop laughing. Other puppets in the store got little response.Another couple tried it out on their 18 month and he was afraid of it.As others have written it is a little scary, would recommend trying it out first.Well made, although the legs have wire in them that helps hold the shape so it is not a toy that should be used without supervision.2 months later and our twins still love it."
4,Dalmatian Vet Kit,Excellent service and pleased with item. Grandchild has enjoyed playing with the puppy and giving the attention to a cooperative pet..
1,Undelivered,"I ordered this on Halloween for my daughter's birthday in middle of November. Am still waiting - it's now Dec 3rd! Amazon assures me it's coming (so's Christmas) and which do you think will get here first? Am about to cancel my order. What shabby service. 6 year old missed out on her birthday present is telling me never to order anything from Amazon again. A very disappointed and let down customer. I am hoping this review will shame Amazon into doing something, since it invited me to create a review - without having delivered my order!!!"
5,worth the price-lots of fun,"Great toy my four year old son loves it. He wants to become a veternarian, so this toy is perfect"
4,Interesting,"This book will be released as a movie on June 26th. For those who like to read the book before seeing the movie, I suggest you go to Barnes and Noble where you can purchase the book NEW online for $15.95 and get it within 3-5 business days with standard delivery. Amazon (which I love and rely on for so many books) doesn't seem to be making less popular books available lately. This is sad. I love the convenience of just ordering books online and having them appear at my door."
1,Don't waste your money!,"The author's ""research"" consists of copying previous guides to the area and transfering topos onto bad photos. Unfortunately, the result is incomplete, inaccurate, and incoherent. As best as can be determined, no effort was made to talk to any of the route authors for this area. You're better off going to the cliff and asking other climbers for directions, recommendations, route names, and grades."
5,A Book That Will Help The Innocent Children Of Divorce...,"This book leads to new and wondrous horizons for divorced men....Most inportantly, a book which will help the innocent children of divorce.-John James,Founder of the Grief Recovery Insitute and author of The Grief Recovery Handbook"
5,Worked GREAT!,My grey leather seats in my Lexus were stained just on the sides from my dark jeans - and it cleaned off the stains in minutes! This worked great - I was completely impressed and i'm glad I bought this product from the reviews I read. I only had to use a tiny bit to clean the seats!! I'm going to try it on my boyfriend's car next to see how they turn out :)
2,Wrong disc,"I ordered Cracker Series 1: The Mad Woman in the Attic, To Say I love You, and One Day a Lemming Will Fly. What came instead of The Mad Woman in the Attic was To Be A Somebody, which is clearly labeled Disc One Series Two, (which I have already). The vendor doesn't ship outside the USA so I had the set sent to a family member in the US whom I planned to visit, where I picked it up and just brought it back to Toronto with me. I won't return for another visit until September at the earliest. I would appreciate it if the vendor would replace this with the correct disc and send it to me in Toronto."
5,cracker: series 1,I loved this series and highly recommend it and all of the cracker series. Fitz is so witty and charming and you'll wish the story never ends. I love Robbie Coltrane.
1,Author has blinders on,"The author of this book neglects to address the fact that Catholic nuns and sisters sexually abuse chidren. Her book supports the lie that Catholic male clergy and religious are the only perpetrators. She apparently hasn't paid attention to the group that she, as a nun, is part of."
4,One of the lucky ones,"I was one of the lucky ones (about 150 of us) who was entertained by the Kinks on the Schoolboys in Disgrace tour of 1975 in a small venue in San Diego, Ca. At that time if you mentioned the band to a friend the would react with: Didn't they break up years ago? Every time I listen to this disc I remember that little room and how great the Kinks were that night. Schooldays starts things up and it sets the tone, Education is the centerpiece of the whole thing but it's a tad overblown. I'm in Disgrace, is the single that never was with The Hard Way a very close 2nd. This is a very good ol' Kinks record and the remaster makes it even more fun to listen to. In just a few years after the release of this disc the Kinks were again back on top of the game and selling major arenas worldwide. But back in 1975 a few of us were very, very lucky, indeed."
1,Not for young children,"I've been searching for a Bible appropriate for my 6 and 8 year old children. Unfortunately most are either babyish or contain language inappropriate for this age range. This Bible for instance says ""made love"" which is a step up from ""had sex"", but still nothing I'm ready to explain to my young children. I'm returning it to Amazon and will stick with the PG version of The Golden Children's Bible which I also ordered. Also, if it makes a difference to anyone, the pages of this Bible are very thin like an adult Bible.Now if my children were 10+ and we'd already had these discussions then I'm sure this Bible would be perfect for them."
5,Excellent cable,"Circuit breaker works really well! Excellent hardware, easy to plug in and out. Flexible and really clear tones on this."
1,Doesn't work,There is a loud pop when I press the mute button on this cable. It doesn't work as advertised. I am using it to run from a passive Schatten pickup in my acoustic guitar to an L.R. Baggs Para DI direct box.
5,Not just a gadget - this is very useful,"First and foremost, this is a high quality instrument cable, well built, with good sound (as near as I can tell), and it carries a lifetime guarantee. You aren't sacrificing any quality or durability (remember the guarantee) to get the switch. The switch itself functions perfectly. There is only a switch on the instrument end of the cable (of course). It sticks out further when in the off position, so you can tell by feel if it's on or off. My experience so far is that it is completely noiseless to turn it on and off.I am a multi-instrumentalist, playing guitar, mandolin and banjo. Having this cable allows me to plug just one cable into the mixer, and let's me shut it off while switching between instruments without the big thump of unplugging live (or without having to run to the mixer and pressing mute). I'm very happy with it so far."
4,Useful Product,I had another cord years ago with a jack which would break the circuit immediately when it was unplugged. This (with its built in switch) is the next best thing. Prevents damage to speakers and that annoying thump. The price is reasonable too.
4,The Shadow of the Galilean,"A bit disappointing in a way. I was waiting for the main character to meet up with Jesus, but he never does. Didn't give very much information on Jesus."
4,Dilbert 25,"I have read Dilbert from the first day. I don't think it is as cutting edge as it once was, but I still look forward to each one. This is as good as any."
5,Another winner from Scott Adams,"All Dilbert books are funny; some, by definition, are funnier than others. This is one of the best of the lot; there were an amazing number of ""copy & pin up on the cubicle walls"" strips in this book."
4,good for beginners,"This book is very simple and is geared toward beginners, does not present advance concepts provides a general idea"
3,SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTED,"Purchased this item because of the brand name ""Plano"". Wasn't as good a product as several older Plano boxes I have. Design and molding seem ok, but it is nowhere near as sturdy as it should be for a box of this size. Warps out of shape easily, and I suspect it will crack if subjected to any heavy stress."
3,Apples and oranges?,"I just bought the current model of this wind chime, made in China by Figi (which apparently took over the J.W. Stannard business about a year ago). The one I just received (purchased somewhere else, I admit) was very high pitched and tinkly with no discernable mode, let alone anything resembling Gregorian chant. Assuming I got a real Figi/Stannard and not a knockoff even further removed from the made-in-USA originals of yesteryear, I have to assume that these windchimes have not made the transition into Asian mass production very well."
5,Southland - Inner city realism!,"As a former EMT in an inner city, I experienced much interaction with FD and PD at various scenarios. This series is one of few that reflects the reality of the streets in this type of locale."
5,Coyote Oldman,Anything by Coyote Oldman is terrific. I have at least 5 albums.Very calming esp in this nerve-racking world! I always play it when flying.
5,Even better than expected!,"I love Folkmanis puppets, and this one is probably my favorite. This tortoise is quite large and is sturdy and well-made. The children absolutely love it! It's a great way to calm down a noisy group of children (because our tortoise doesn't like to come out of its shell unless everyone is quiet!) The head pulls all the way into the shell, and you can make its mouth open and close and make expressions. This puppet has a lot of character and personality. The photos don't do it justice. You have to see this one to appreciate how well-made it is and how much fun it can be! I highly recommend this puppet!"
4,Normal,"It's too bad HBO movies aren't eligible for Oscar considerations because their ""made-for-TV"" flicks are far far better than most Hollywood garbage out there. While it wasn't a powerhouse like last year's ""Wit"", ""Normal"" was still a solid movie that deals with a tough issue (sex change and acceptance) with a great sense of humor, without ever being trite or turning it into a farce as most Hollywood movies would have done. Tom Wilkinson and Jessica Lange are fantastic as always, but it's Hayden Panettiere who steals the show as their daughter."
3,Not that good.,"It looks pretty cheap and has a rough finish in a way dissapointed because I paid extra for the Moroso brand, anyway I'll use it for a Marine battery bank and should be OK for that, always remember to disconnect the negative cable of your battery if you are not planning on driving your car for more than a week. Believe me you will come back to a frustrating discharged battery otherwise. I recommend others to check the FLAMING RIVER brand of disconnecting switches they are expensive but really worth the price. I have the big Flaming with the optional padlock on top, a beauty and a real good investment despite the price since it also protects the vehicle from theft, if you drive an older vehicle without much electronics this is the way to go, probably safer and cheaper than an alarm system and Maintenance Free!"
2,I expected a lot more for the price,"If you like your books a bit larger, combined with some basic SLR fundamentals, then this book is for you. If not then stick with the manual that comes with the camera. The title should have been enough for me ""A Short Course..."" but at present there aren't too many books out on the Digital Rebel. The construction of the book is of the lowest quality, i.e., plain copy paper that appears to have been produced through a standard copy machine available in any small office. $10.00 would have been a generous price for this product. I expect more when I go above the $30.00 threshold for a publication."
1,Oh my Gawd!,"I have listened to sound clips of a lot of these songs and they are so lame! I mean, how lame can you get? ""Temptation Boogie""? How can you stand to listen to songs that are all exactly the same? ""I love God...God is great.....blah, blah, blah"" Maybe some variety would at least be better. If you're gonna talk about God, at least do it in a tasteful way. He sounds like a Raffi Rip-Off!"
2,A gore fest that requires therapy after viewing,"I loved the first film, I think Devon Sawyer was actually very good. When he had visions it was scary and convincing. It's scary when Devon Sawyer is a better actor than anyone in Final Destination 2.The film starts out with A.J. Cook's character going on a road trip with her friends. She has a vision of a huge traffic accident, she then blocks traffic to save everyone on that roads life. Then of course since everyone on that road was supposed to die death starts to kill them one by one like in the first film.The death scenes are incredibly gory and detailed but also seemed like ways you would've seen Kenny die on South Park. They're silly and heartless at the same time. It's like the film is trying to make death out to be funny a lot of time. Sorry but I didn't find 2 different scenes where young boys die right in front of their mothers very funny. I found the film highly disturbing actually."
5,A Must for You DVD librabry,"This movie is definetly for anyone who likes horror that will have you jumping out of you seats. Now it not A+ movie, but it will keep you inerested until the very end."
3,PRETTY GOOD,Tha accident on the freeway at the begining of the movie is spectacular to say the least. The problem is every one involved just readily accept the fact that death is after them with no proof at all. As the body count rises the viewer is thrust into a comglomerate of of visal fortitude as we experience the rif of emotions. worth renting only.
3,Good gory movie...,"Well if your looking for a movie with tons of gore and crazy deaths then this is the movie for you. This movie had even better more creative deaths than the original. I found it very entertaining and while very gory, the deaths were cool and I liked this movie."
3,A guilty pleasure!,"Its a matter of life and death when eight strangers narrowly escape a carastrophic freeway accident. only a young girl's premonition saced them all from a grisly end. But now that they have put a rift in death's design, there's going to be a price to pay- and its going to be painful.Rated R for strong violence/gruesome accidents, language, drug content, and some nudity."
4,Surprisingly good sequel!,"Of course, you must have some level of attraction to horror movies to like this one, even if it's more of a supense movie (except ther gore scenes).The acting is good, the plot does not try to be more than it's possible to be according to the first movie. Entertaining and dreadful. After all, the ""Killer"" can't be seen by anyone! You may bet there'll be a third movie..."
1,Death has no Patience Anymore for Nuances,"This movie is too contrived, the whole movie consisting of build-ups to a predictable climax. The first movie was better because any action taken by Death is portrayed as ambiguous, something that could have been an accident of Nature or a consequence of circumstances. Here in this movie, it is obviously Death out to get his guy or gal with longly drawn-out events happening that could not possibly occur naturally.Too gruesome and contrived."
2,Interesting cinematography...,"Final Destination 2 is a sequel which is a pretty dreadful story compared to the original. Here, the characters are sent into a similar ""accidents"" as in the first film, however, there are some sizeable gaps in the story that defeat the cinematic experience. What saves this film is the interesting cinematography. For example, the introduction displays superb camera work."
4,Great concealability!,This holster is very comfortable and provides great concealability. I have worn through four in 10 years and they are well worth the money.
4,Okay buy,"This was an okay buy. The strap holding the gun in is a little large. That being said, my 438 S&W has a reduced hammer so a full hammer might work better. Soft case is comfortable and can be turned around and worn on the outside."
4,fun fountain,"We love the way our fountain livens up our patio during the day. The solar power is convenient, since it doesn't have to be near an electrical outlet. Be aware, however, that it does not store the power, so it doesn't run at night or when a cloud passes over. Also, we have to replace the water in it daily, since evaporation takes a toll in the summer."
2,a collection of bad songs,"This is a well layed out book with a helpful CD, but the choice of songs is awful. They are the old folk songs that no one has heard of and are no fun to play. Songs like this made me quit playing Saxophone 20 years ago, and now that I am starting to play again, I won't play lame songs."
5,Boffo Shakespeare!!!,"This book is an amazingly comprehensive study of Shakespeare in contemporary American mass culture. If you want to understand why Shakespeare is showing up everywhere so explosively, particularly in new teen films like ""10 Things I Hate About You"" (based on the Taming of the Shrew) or""Never Been Kissed"" (based on As You Like It), then read this incredibly sophisticated and entertaining study."
2,"Perhaps a good reference text, but it's supposed to be a graduate intro text","Compared to the 1st edition this text is about twice the size. It is a monstrously large book. However, the book fails to teach the concepts in a clear fashion required when one is just starting in the field. Too much attention is spent to minute details that confound the subject. A great deal of space is used on deriving formulas.It is without a doubt that the authors are exceptional minds in their fields, and have a fine understanding of the material. However, speaking as a student, they do me no favors in explaining what is going on. This text needs to be rewritten and edited to serve as a useful textbook for graduate students. Until then, the book will possibly be useful as a reference."
4,Wonderful Kitchy Halloween Music....Unpleasant Dreams!,"This collection of Halloween classics is a scream (literally!)From the Crypt Kickers singing the classic Monster Mash, to Oingo Boingodoin' Deadman's Party, this album will keep you rockin and rollin this Hallow's Eve"
4,Great collection of Fun Halloween Songs,We have 3 of the 'Elvira' collections & our favorites are this one & Revenge of Monster Hits. The light-hearted songs have been great background music at our Halloween parties & while decorating.We like Revenge of the Monster Hits the best but enjoy the tremendous variety of songs on Haunted Hits.
2,Won't get a party boppin',"While staying true to the Halloween theme, I wouldn't play this collection all the way through at a party. While there are some great selections (""Monster Mash"", ""Dead Man's Party"", ""I Put a Spell on You"", and ""Voodoo Voodoo""), it is too much of a mish mosh of slow tempo and up tempo to get a party really rockin'. It would probably be great for kicking back while answering the door to trick or treaters, or just to get into the Halloween spirit. Be sure to skip the Elvira song ""Full Moon""...it's bad enough to make the cats go and hide."
4,amazing ladder for painting walls,"All these years I have used a regular 8 foot step ladder for painting walls, I was missing out. This Werner 273-2 Type 1 project ladder with 3 steps is the way to go. Place to put paint at top and full steps to stand on while painting instead of narrow steps on regular step ladder. I would have given 5 stars but it is very tricky to open and close."
5,Finally an easy devotional for families and children,"I highly recommend this book for those looking for a devotional for their family. Concise, short, easy to use. Perfect after dinner."
4,good product,"I like this watch. It is reasonable price. Although I still need to read the manual to change time for the first time, it is fairly easy. The watch is light and thin. Although the function of days count down is useless to me, other functions are good."
2,No es para producir...,El producto es muy pequeño y no sirve para producir al nivel que yo lo quiero hacer...Creo que este controlador es mas para niños y para que ellos jueguen...Inclusive en la caja salen dibujos de niños...
4,"For $50, it is reasonable","The main drawback of this is its main asset: It is tiny. It fits nicely under my 17"" iMac, and allows me to play with GarageBand, which is all I really wanted. For about $100 you can get a proper, full-size, midi/usb keyboard, which if I were at all serious would be the thing to get. But as a toy (for an adult or child), this is acceptable. Beware that the keys are so small that they are narrower than my fingers (which are not that fat) in diameter! It is a child-size keyboard really. I ordered this on Sunday evening and had standard shipping and it arrived 10am Wednesday. It works on Apple without external software; for PCs it comes with a CD. It seems to work fine.Please note that this is not a stand-alone keyboard. To use it, you need the computer, and the sounds produced are synthesized by the computer software (such as GarageBand)."
4,Great for what i use it for,Im not a professional keyboard player. I bought this keyboard to have something to play around in with reason and Guitar Pro. It suits those needs great. Its detects right away and withing minutes you will be playing.The keyboard itself is extremly small reminds me of a kids toy keyboard. If your looking for something more professional you will probably have to fork out the $100 bucks and get the bigger model.
5,Fun for the fan,"Our local RHPS, which is called Lips Down on Dixie, doesn't follow this routine, and I guess you can hardly blame them after 30 years? But we really love this CD. There are some priceless moments. Some of them are simple, some of them are unrecognizeable individuals, and some of them might cleverly catch you off guard with the whole audience yelling in unison. The two cds included each have one track, and are a complete sountrack for the entire experience.Let's call it a basic starting guide for the new fan. And a very fun one."
4,It serves it's purpose,I only use this bag when I need to be out all day. It actually doesn't fit as much as I thought it would. I do like the color and all the pockets it has inside. I would recommend it and would purchase it again.
5,Perfect Condition,"The book arrived as expected in perfect condition, and will provide a long time of reference service."
3,You really feel like a dummy,"I have mixed feelings about this book so, here are the facts:Pros- Very comprehensible language.- Starts from the very basics and builds up to a very high level.- Plenty of exercises.- You might be able to stop at any time without getting lost or forgetting what you've learned.Cons- Lame, lame, lame jokes, really takes you off focus, and gets annoying.- The juvenile comments make you feel that you are INDEED a dummy and this is the only way to learn.- Some of the exercises are complicated with no answer key (if you did it wrong, can't figure out where the mistake is)I must say that this is my first experience with a `dummies series' book. I am still sticking to it - for now - because I need to learn English better, but I might buy another book later."
4,"Henry Rollins ""Prose""","Interesting read from Henry Rollins. Much like his other books, he finds ways to challenge your perceptions. 4-stars because I am pleased with the book. Just not the quality of a 5 star."
4,Maxa vs. Rick Steves,I have bought DVDs from both Maxa and Steves and find both to be pretty good. If I had to pick one I'd probably recommend Max as Rick Steves can come off as a bit boring nearing grating after a couple of hours. Steves books are thorough however and make for a good source (though Karen Brown's are the best for quaint inns and travel itineraries).
3,How about a little fan fair?,"Of the early 70's albums, this one I rate below A Wizard/A True Star and Something/Anything. A few too many electronic doodles for my liking. Would have made a 5 star single album though. Side 3, No1 Lowest Common Denominator to Heavy Metal Kids is absolutely brilliant in its range and execution."
4,So Much Better Than Expected,"This 2007 musical version of the Reese Witherspoon film is energetic, light-hearted & fun.While I enjoyed seeing the production (starring the terrific Laura Bell Bundy), the score seemed somewhat unmemorable - until I got the cd. Some of the songs work better on stage (ie. ""Bend and Snap""), but after a few listens, several of the songs emerged as favorites:Omigod You GuysIrelandSo Much BetterLegally BlondeLegally Blonde RemixThis is not meant to be a thought-provoking show - just one to smile."
3,lost in translation,"The bwy show was much better than expected. Bundy was super. Dancing was extraordinary. The CD captures the music, and is certainly lively, but it misses an integral part of the show, the frenetic staging."
5,Legally Great,"I loved this CD, I think all the songs were very catchy and fun to dance to and the price was unbeleiveable"
5,amazing,"I love this soundtrack! Legally Blonde is one of my favorite movies and after listening to the one free song they have on iTunes I bought the entire album.There isn't one song I dislike which makes it difficult to choose which songs will go on my iPod.The vocals are great, the lyrics are creative. Definitely one of my new favorite musicals."
2,An A cast in a C- show....,"A superbly talented cast cannot save this turkey of a score. Despite great work by the entire cast, there isn't one good song in this entire score."
3,Rides high,"Good quality however, for concealed carry, this holster rides a little high on the belt and has come loose a few times when sitting down."
5,Heart Warming Classics,"This children's cd has been my holiday soundtrack as long as I can remember. Now 26, I still listen to it every holiday. It is heartwarming, with music that is sure to keep you rocking around the Christmas tree this holiday season!"
2,"Some good recipes, but terminal case of ""the cutes""","As with their previous book, I suggest you borrow this book from the library before buying it. You will either like their style of writing or you won't.This one is laid out in the same busy/distracting style, with again, lots of ""cute"" names for recipes. I found it annoying to read, but your children might think it lots of fun.And, transfer the recipes you like onto recipe cards rather than trying to work with the book."
3,Do not order these sheets (!),"These sheets were awful. The color was not even white even though that is the color I ordered. They looked OLD. I was hoping to have sheets that were not very wrinkled, but these were terrible (!) And after I washed them to be able to use them, it was too late. Because the paper work said I needed to return them in the oirginal condition. TOO late. I tried washing them again, but nothing was better. They went immediately to the ""donation"" pile. I knew I couldn't return them because of the ""original"" condition statement. P. S. I'm not happy (!)"
1,These sheets sound and feel like tissue paper,"I have never felt / heard sheets that were so scratchy and loud. I returned both sets that I purchased. Even after washing with warm water, with softner, nothing worked and again, the sound of these sheets would wake you up as you turned on them."
3,Off color,"I had ordered the Color PLUM, but the color is no where near what was pictured, It was more of a greyish color with a tinge of purple.The material felt nice as I made up the bed and and since I do not have a deep mattress and box spring, as stated in another comment they are a bit oversized but workable.Although the color was not as expected they do fit in to the color scheme of my bedroom and I will keep them.If ordering,Just expect that color may not appear as pictured."
3,Pinzon Sheets,"The sheets were good. they were cut full big, in fact too large on thefitted bottom sheet, otherwise they were ok."
4,Great sheets for the price,"I'm very happy with the purchase of these sheets, especially at such a low price point. I consider them very nice basic sheets. They aren't the special ones I'd pull out for guests, yet I very much enjoy using them myself. They have a high enough thread count that they perform well, not much wrinkling, and are smooth and comfortable. Would buy them again."
2,A Day No Pigs Would Die Review,"After reading this book, I would reccomend this book for teens. In my opinion, this book was very amusing! The most amusing part to me was when Rob was at the Rutland Fair looking for perverts. I also think that this book was very easy to relate to since I'm a teenager and I know what Rob was going through. I have troble in school just like Rob did in Laungeuge Arts when he got a ""D"". This book had very good dialect that went along with he book. It made the book more interesting and kept me reading. Therefore, I would like to reccomend this book to all who enjoy the ""Comming of Age"" theme in books and literature."
3,Not enough photos,More writing than photos - so not very good for armchair travellers. But very good if you are actually there touring around the country.
3,A Tender Story,"Tami Hoag is my hero among writers. I have read most of her books and have never been disappointed with any of them. They give me hours of reading pleasure. However, ""Sara's Sin"" diverged from her usual thrilling and suspenseful writes. Although I did enjoy reading it, it can not measure up to her thick, action-packed novels, but it was an interesting story that held my interest.Reviewed by: Jeanette Cooper[...]"
5,"Beautiful, uplifting music that draws you closer to God","Since I bought Oleta's CD, nothing else has been played. It's so soothing, that it is perfect for my hectic days at the office. If you love Gospel or inspirational music, this CD's for you."
4,Good Intro to medieval literature,"Well, I don't really like Osbourne's ""Magic TreeHouse"" tales, but don't judge THIS beautiful book by ""those."" THIS BOOK is very nicely done. All the representative tales from the middle ages are here, retold in a clear, easy to read (or listen to) prose that captures most of the original (in most cases.) The illustrations are captivating. Each tale includes a title page that has a short quote in the original language (with a modern translation) which will intrigue some children, and there is a fine time line at the back of the book. We used this to supplement medieval studies in our homeschool for a second grader. A great resource."
5,Excellent,"This is THE source for the Coligny Calendar. However, a couple of caveats. It is a scholary work, and the book is a small one for the price (expensive in comparison to popular works but fairly normal for scholarly tomes). The pictures (and the book) are small, and hard to see in detail (I had to use a magnifying glass to examine the full calendar reconstuction). If you are interested in the background of the work, you would be aided by reading the authors 1992 work, ""The Gaulish calendar: A reconstruction from the bronze fragments from Coligny, blah blah blah"", which you will have to get out of a library because it is long since out of print.Having gotten that out of the way, if you want to know that the -real- (versus neopagan/druidic fantasy) Celts used for holidays and auspicious days, this is the source. It seems to be a traditional Roman peg calendar, overlying a far more ancient druidic calendar."
5,5 stars !,"More than a classic, this book is a gift, expected for so long !It is clearly an attempt to update the famous ""Introduction à l'étude comparative des langues indo-européennes"" by Antoine Meillet, which dates back to the 1930s for the first edition. Meillet's book remains a classic, but is of a more compact aspect, less technical, written in long sentences, and is full of digressions and anecdotes: it can be read fluently.Beekes's book aims at being sharper, written with more concise but relevant sentences; it is a handbook more than a book, technical and complete.Definetly an indispensable reference."
4,The Borgia daughter,I love Jean Plaidys historical novels and couldn't wait to read this one. Never disappoints captures your interest right away and holds it till the end
2,Scale Aircraft Drawings,"A collection of drawings from various sources,some recent, others very old, some good, others highly innacurate or even downright fictitious! More for the coffee table than the workshop."
2,Clear Lake Wi,"I actually don't remember too much about this film. We watched it 2 days ago, and I have already, thankfully, forgotten most of it. It was just a generic, slasher type film with nothing to offer. Unbelievable story, unbelievable acting, and unbelievably bad. I feel sorry for the good people of the real town of Clear Lake, WI that have to have this film forever associated with their fine town. Thankfully, not too many people ever even heard about this film. I also feel sorry for the actors who had to endure the freezing weather on location, for what I'm sure will be very little return for their efforts, especially Michael Madsen, whom I love as an actor. Why he lent his name to this horrible excuse of a movie is beyond me. What was he thinking? Thankfully, he was only in it for a brief period of time and I'm guessing that he didn't have to leave the comfort confines of California for any of the shooting."
4,Stand and Spin!,"I consider this one of the more advanced DVDs in the Spinning collection because a lot of the time you will be standing. I've been riding a Spin bike to these videos for about 2 months now, and it wasn't until last week that I was able to even Stand in hand position 2. Yep, I sit at a desk all day and have for years without taking care of addressing the problems associated with it. I will be extremely happy the day I am able to properly complete this DVD session, so it is something to aspire to. The motivational comments are good, however they are too frequent and resemble the pace of Gilmore Girls episode. This is the only detracting point for me, a very good DVD and worthwhile addition to anyone's collection."
3,An ok game,"I purchased this game this summer for my 5 yr old Scooby Doo fan. He loves the game. Easy to play and understand. However, my complaint is the figures ride around on the spinner and they don't stay in place. When you spin it - they fly out constantly. After you play it a few times, the bottom of the monster gets banged up and doesn't fit into his slot on the spinner anymore. I feel this could have been designed much better than what it is. But, as I mentioned, my son does love to play the game, even if you are constantly putting the pieces back after each spin."
1,they were daydreaming when they edited this movie...,"There may be a total of 10 minutes of images, played over and over in slow motion to stretch it out to a full length feature. In my opinion a total waste of time and money, save both and buy something else..."
1,Another low-budget trash,"There must be something wrong about Americans and low-budget gay theme films. I think that among U.S. creators label ""low budget"" justifies creating something soooo horribly bad and stupid that it's almost unbelievable.""Daydream obsession"" is another perfect evidence to my thesis.The plot of this ""artwork"" is pure hot air. If you cut out all the softcore scenes (well, if you look for ""real"" action, don't bother!) there is not much to watch. Really. For longer part of it I couldn't resist laughing. The guys push too far trying to be ""actors"" :) ha ha haThose who appear on the screen have only one job to do and it's not (yep, you quessed it) acting. If they had to play wooden pieces of furniture, they would have been perfect!There is nothing positive I can say about both pictures and music. The quality sucks."
1,Made where????!!!!,"The quality of this product is very disappointing. It looks like someone poured this in their garage. There are weak spots and grooves in the plastic, that causes things to get in there and even cleaning well doesn't seem to get all the stuff off. Being in the healthcare field knowing what I do makes me not want to use this item, not just because it seem to be of poor design. I wouldn't suggest buying this product unless you plan on just using it once and throwing it away."
1,Miss Read Fans Endure Numerous Typos On Kindle,"As always, with the Miss Read Kindle books. The typos are awful. In this book, almost every double L in it is turned into a D. Sally is Sady, calling is cading, etc. This occurs most when the double L is in the middle of the word. IAL's are also frequently turned into some word unknown in the English language. There are other patterns of typos in this book as well. Each Miss Read Kindle book has a its own set of typo patterns to irritate the reader. The Miss Read books are delightful, if you aren't reading them on your KINDLE."
5,Best Guitar Stand,"I own many guitars and I like to set them on floor guitar stands for access during practise and rehearsal. These little stands are the best. The guitar is secure yet not encumbered by protruding guitar stand apparatus. This exhibits the guitar, not the stand."
5,The best Ramones tribute album ever!,This CD totally rocks! Anyone who has ever liked a Ramones song will love this very unique take on the work of the world's premier punk/pop band. Imagine if CBGBs was located in the Caribbean - it would sound like Pan For Punks. All the best Ramones songs played on steel drum. Awesome and unlike any other Ramones tribute band...or copy copy wanna be punkers.
4,MAGIC CARD TRICKS ANYONE CAN DO,This is an excellent book for budding magicians not only does the book help maturering skills but it is a very cheap but handy book which you can fool your friends with. *****
3,Ok book,Limited receipes. Ok for childen. Simple cooking. Most things are probably things you are alrrady aware of. Not much more to say
1,waste of money.,All this is all over the internet. Nothing new and exciting here if you camp with groups like girl scouts or boy scouts. Get it from the library or search the internet for ideas
2,And they pay this guy $40M per picture?,"Any director or producer will tell you that actors in a comedy must 'play it straight!' Carrey thinks HE'S funny (a kiss of death for a comedy)and has trouble regulating his level of obnoxiousness. Although this is an old film it still rates a review. The writers of these AV films seek to create a gross, obnoxious and disgusting presentation of primarily bathroom humor (more of a target audience of 8 year-olds than adults.)Not Carrey's best work. With all the great writers out there, will Hollywood ever wake up?"
3,"Disappointing, but Funny",This film was okay. The first one: Ace Ventura: Pet Detective is way better. The whole African theme was different. It could have been better. Overall it was an alright movie.
1,I liked the first movie but this was just not funny!,"Well I like Jim Carrey fan and I liked Ace Ventura Pet Detective, that movie was funny and being a Star Trek fan I loved Jim Carrey's hysterical imitation of William Shatner's Captain James T. Kirk but When Nature Calls just wasn't funny, I think I laughed once and that was it, well actually it was more like a mild chuckle instead of a gut busting laugh!"
3,Ace Ventura - When Nature Calls (1995),"This one of Jim Carrey's stupidest movies ever made. The story is about the pet detective Ace trying to solve who's trying to scare two African Tribes away from their village. The plot for this movie makes as much sense as getting kicked in the nads, and is extremely predictable to boot. Jim Carrey is more annoying in this film than funny, and the humor is a bit redundant throughout the film. Overall, unless you have low taste in movies then see this, but if you're like me then don't bother wasting your time."
3,Not that great,"I liked the first movie because it made Ace look very intelligent, and he has that ""you can't mess with me cause I have a very witty come back attitude"". Ace even had a serious personality on more than 2 occasions in the film.But in When Nature Calls, he's completely idiotic. He's never serious and he doesn't have that ""you can't mess with me attitude"" That was my main beef with the film. The film's plot isn't that great and it's all about Ace makin an, excuse me for this, ass of himself.It however does have some funny parts and you should watch it if you like Jim Carrey"
2,"Beautiful, But Too Small","The earrings are beautiful and of good quality, but they are too small, the size does not match the the measurements that were given. I couldn't put them on they were so small."
3,Maneater Triple Feature Three (Croc/Sea Beast/Swarm),Two decent SciFi channel movies and one stinker. So if you don't mind this price for two then you may want to pick this up.Crochas Michael Madsen hunting a giant croc with a reasonably good story and support cast.Sea Beasthas Corin Nemec and is directed by Ziller. A giant lizard creature can be semi-invisible like thePredator (Widescreen Edition)and spit a nasty hulker that will let him eat you alive without you feeling it.Shark Swarmhas John Schneider and a couple other notable actors in a mini-series that needed better everything. Goes to prove a good cast doesn't necessarily make a good movie. If you enjoy these catchLoch Ness Terror.CA Luster
3,Ok Movie,"This movie was ok. It had a logical plot, good acting (which is generally bad in this kind of films, and ok CGI (although the croc its mostly composed of stock footage). One bad thing its that this DVD its very bare-bone. It does not even have subtitles nor other languages. I think they used barely more than half of the DVD space to fit it in (thats if it was a Dual Layer). But I considered ok especially for the tiny budget that was used, even for these kind of films. Worth checking out."
4,Good,Not my favorite of the Janine French books but a very good book to own as part of the collection.
5,Great Product,Great product to give your plants the extra nutrients that they need for healthy growth. I would recommend this earthworm castings for everyone who desires to improve their plants' livlihood and health.
2,Subpar,"After I enjoyed Laymon's The Cellar, I decided to give this one a read. I was disappointed! Sure, the violence and gore are aplenty. The story for most part meanders aimlessly. Characters are uninteresting and unsympathetic. If you want to read a horror novel featuring cannibals, check out Jack Ketchum's The Offseason."
5,The title says it all,"I have searched all my life to find something to help not only myself in my quest to find a healthier body but to also find inner peace I came across this book and knew immediately, that this would change my life and could help change the world. It's every word touched me deep inside, resonating with my core belief that as I change, grow & evolve, I can affect change around me. Knowing that this book has taken the author a lifetime to share, inspires me to do the same. Everything I have learned about health and serenity is presented in this book, in such an elegant and inviting way. One reading was amazing, but it's good to go back and savor each chapter, again & again. This was my most favorite book of 2009, and I wish I could impart in this review my strong sense that it is a must read for anyone who truly cares about their own health & the health of the world."
3,reformation study bible,This bible was put out before but was re-edited and reissued. I prefer the previous version which was in NKJ
4,A Distinctive Study Bible,"There are dozens of Study Bibles on Amazon's lists, each carrying distinctiveness. But some are more distinctive than others. The Reformation Study Bible is one of the some. If you expect colorful maps, detailed charts and exhaustive concordance, you would be disappointed. But if you are looking for a study bible with handy inspiring notes to guide you to understanding the Spirit-filled God's Word, this is the book!I find The Reformation Study Bible very helpful and useful for devotional time and pastoral ministries."
4,"Good, Could be great","I only gave this Bible 4 stars because this edition has some flaws. One, and the most annoying, is that the headings/ book names are in the middle of the page instead of on the outside edge of the page-like guide words, which makes looking up specific passages more cumbersome (it is a large book). The second is that I expected it to have all the helps (Westminister Confession, etc. ) that the NIV had and it did not have them after the concordance. The ESV is excellent and the study helps throughout are also good but could use an index not just a table of content. I think the ESV as a study bible in still ""in process"" and I look forward to a more complete version with thorough helps and all the notes or even some word study."
3,"A disappoinment, in my opinion","In short, I was very disappointed when I examined this ""new"" study Bible because the only thing new about it is the translation--the ESV. Nothing, absolutely nothing was revised or updated. The old notes from the Geneva Study Bible were lifted from the NKJ and added to the ESV, and that's it. As noted by a reviewer below, even some maps are missing or are colorless. Zondervan's Spirit of the Reformation Study Bible, in my opinion, is far superior, in terms of the apparatus. Yeah, yeah, it's the bedeviled NIV, but I would have no trouble recommending it to someone who wants a solid study Bible and was primarily concerned about the study material to help in their own study."
4,Good Value,"Good quality, sturdy plastic. Hinge is a little flimsy due to the one-piece design molded into the lid and body. One of the four I ordered arrived with the hinge torn."
3,Beware the Fury of a Woman Scorned...,"Jessica Lange plays a middle-aged woman (Cousin Bette) in period France who finally decides on revenge after years of being cruelly mistreated and betrayed by her rich relatives. The final straw comes when her young cousin-daughter successfully (through very sneaky means) ""steals"" away her young lover (a poor art sculpturer whom Bette cares for and nurses to health when he is ill and who's the only ""light"" and hope in poor Bette's life). To avenge, Bette seeks the help of a trusted friend who's a famous courtesan (played by Elizabeth Shue) but even she betrays Bette. However, the movie ends on a good note with all the ""bad characters"" getting their due in the end.The movie is well directed, but the characters are not particularly memorable or likeable (even Bette's). Still, it makes for an interesting watch, especially if you like unconventional period dramas. Jessica Lange is also brilliant in her role as the title character."
3,INTERESTING.. BUT ULTIMATELY A BIT DISAPPOINTING,"as the books title makes clear, this is more about the YEAR 1215 and incidentally it also happens to be the year the Magna Carta came into existencea lot of intersting history, at times you wonder what it has to do with the MC... i was looking for a book that would explore each of the clauses of the MC, or at least a lot more than this book does... the entire document is presented at the end of the book but what i was interested in is what was going on before each clause, and how did things change after.. i wanted to know more about the document, and off course the historical figures behind the who, what, when, where and why... but we get more of the who's, the when's and where's but not much of the what and why...anyways, enjoy... but you may want to seek out something else if you want to learn about the nuts and bolts of the MC"
4,Great historical insights,"I stumbled across this book and, desiring to improve my knowledge about this historical document, picked it up. It is very well structured and composed, framing the cultural context of Magna Carta in immensely readable form before delving into the individual clauses, which really gives the reader a rounded perspective on the minutiae that would baffle anybody reading the document for the first time.The vast bibliography is impressive and can lead a student of history down several topical tangents.My only complaint is that it imposes modern cynicism on the religious atmosphere of the time, focusing on the failings of the clergy (an unavoidable reality in any time period) and glossing over the true devotion of the faithful evident in other accounts of the same historical period (i.e. Chesterton's biography of St. Francis of Assisi)."
2,The Angel Maker--Not,"Oh no, not another so-called mystery about a villain ""harvesting"" human organs. Not another""mystery"" with a villain who has both a funny name, and tics. Not a mystery."
4,Not your typical baseball movie,"I'm not a big sports fan, but this isn't your typical baseball movie with shallow characters action and base humor. Instead, it's a mellow movie about how different cultures merge as a young Dominican man comes to America to play baseball, with lots of character development. The humor is subtle / subdued - like how the imported baseball players can't speak English well, so they always order the French toast because it's the only thing they know how to say. There's a lot there for baseball fans, but I didn't feel like I was missing out when I couldn't follow all the baseball references. Definitely worth watching, but I couldn't give it the full 5 stars since I reserve that for movies that REALLY wow me."
3,I was lost the entire movie because I don't speak spanish....,"I saw the trailer and it seem that the movie was in English, but when I bought it, I didn't understand the movie because they spoke in Spanish just about the entire movie. I had to make things out on my own and put it together and guess what they were saying. It was just ok for me!"
1,Not what I ordered,"Someone bought this for me off my wish list, but what I got was a triangular spatula, not round. I can't really send it back since it was a gift, and I don't really have any use for it."
5,Good commedy,Another good old movie. A lot like todays generation people really haven't changed. A good movie to really think about.
1,NOT AS GOOD A DELL,"DELL HAS A MP3 PLAYER Called the Dell Pocket DJ, It costs less then an Apple ipod mini, with up to 25% longer battery life, and it holds more then twice as many songs, its $199, Personally i am not a fan of Dell Latly, but I would Recomend this product more then the apple ipod. I dont have either of them, I have a motorola MPx220 GSm phone whitch plays Mp3, doesnt hold many songs. but i like it."
1,Mine only lasted a year and five months,"I loved my iPod mini. But it broke only a year and five months after purchase. Since it was out of the warranty period, Apple refused to do anything about it. Many other Mini owners had the same problem occurring at the same time, but Apple refused to acknowledge that these particular models might be lemons.Buyer beware! They are great machines, but only last a year or so on average."
2,"Not a bad product, but costs way too much.","While I don't have any issues with the product itself (although the battery is known to go out on ipods), it costs FAR too much. For less than the price of one of these you can get another player with 5 times the amount of storage! There was even one on here recently (Archos 20GB) that was HALF the price of this and five times the storage space!Only get this product if you're concerned more about being trendy than listening to music."
2,WOW.....thats a lot of money,"I am not reviewing how this works b/c i am sure it works as well as all other ipods but......i am shocked how expensive it is for a 4gb player. I know its an ipod so it will be expensive but you can get a 20gb player (non-ipod) for about the same price, maybe a little more. It is clear that you are not paying for gbs here but style. I understand that but it still seems like a high price to pay for fashion. I just want to listen to music!!!!!"
3,Good but the battery won't last forever.,"I'm catching up on all my amazon reviews. Sorry this won't help much because the technology has moved way on. This was my first mp3 player and it worked well. After a couple of years the battery would not hold a charge and it was regulated to a car mp3 player that stayed plugged it to the DC lighter jack in the car. I haven't used it in months but, I think as longs as its plugged in it will play."
1,IPOD Mini has hang up problems,"I have owned a mini for about a month. It hangs up and must be rebooted. The sound quality is poor. If you use it for Audio books, it is impossible to go to the correct part of the book where you stopped. I would urge anyone to go to apples own discussion board to see the numerous technical complaints. Buyer Beware."
2,Style Over Substance!!!!,"Apple has proved once again that people will buy things if they come in pretty colors!! Like their successful original imacs, which came in a plethora of colors and sold through the roof, the ipod mini is doing the same. Let's put it this way; you'll buy the ipod mini if you're trying to make a fashion statement and show hip you are, but aren't really serious about music. No serious music fan would be satisfied with a device that only holds 1000 songs, when they could buy the 20GB ipod for only $50 more, and have 4000 more songs!!! Do they still teach economics in school?"
5,Awesome,WoW! I first was a little skeptic about the quality of this ipod but it is one of the best quality mp3 players i have ever seen thats on the market right now! It has so much memory for such a little mp3 player and it really is easy to use along with itunes and the ipod mini dock. From now on I will trust apple with their software because of their terrific job in desighning this hardware. I also suggest the original ipods as well if you are willing to spend an extra buck or two.
4,I love my iPod!!!,I recieved the pink iPod mini for x-mas. Its one of the best gifts i've ever gotten. Here's what I love:MUSIC!!- The volume is great and i love that i can put my own choice of music on it.Click wheel- easy to manage and funsize: small and descrete i can hide it almost anywhere!*BUy this for a child(teen) or a family member. Def. worth the money.Thanks shay!
5,I really like the ipod,"it is easy to use, a great price and no trouble so farit has to be charged all the time if you use it alot"
1,Product did not function correctly from day 1,"Last February, I bought a ""refurbished"" iPod 4 GB mini from this seller for $40.00. It worked fine when plugged in, but I'm pretty sure the point of having an iPod is to be able to listen to music when you are more than 3 feet away from an electrical outlet. The iPod I received had a battery life of less than 20 minutes.I have little doubt that the supplier knew at the time this product was posted for sale that it was defective. If they did not, they still failed to test it, which is almost as unscrupulous.-John"
2,"Sounds great, but transfering music to it is painful","I love the size and ergonomics of this little guy, but dealing with transferring music onto the iPod mini from iTunes is a MAJOR pain. Supposedly, you can select the ""manual"" method of transferring music that you've placed onto the iTunes library from your own CDs or from the iTunes music store, but sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't. I've spent several hours over the past few days trying to create folders for ""workout music"", ""soft tunes"", etc., on the iPod mini and I can create the playlists, but often can't transfer any music to those playlists. I've sent an email to Apple Support -- their response will determine whether or not I return this unit and buy something easier to use."
1,Ordered in April and still waiting in July,"I used the Audible.com discount to get an iPOD. Big Mistake. Audible is great, but I have had to pay for 3 months now of a monthly subsciption waiting for my iPOD from Amazon. I ordered it on April 26 and have been told late July. First I was told June and then they pushed it out. Amazon should be ashamed of themselves for not being clear on their backlog timeframe. Beware! Amazon also note. I am affraid to order anything else from you as not to disrupt my pending order."
2,Confused!,"I got my ipod for christmas and loved it at first sight. My mum went through hell to get it for me and it worked. I had my xmas present.BUT. It worked on windows XP, which i have, i installed the software, put a few cds onto itunes. I took my ipod off the computer AAAAND It didnt have any songs on it. I have tried loads of times to put the music on, but none have worked. It says it would work faster if i had a ""hi-speed"" usb port. What exactly is that supposed to mean. I have a fairly new computer, but it dosent appear to have a firewire or another usb port. There are 2 usb ports but one is used for internet. I really dont know what to do. Can anyone help?from 12 year old who is going to eventualy break to her mum that the ipod that took months to get dosent work and really needs an answer sooner rather than laterThanks!"
3,Battery Life,"This is a nice product but the frenzy over it is really uncalled for. The price, at $250, is really expensive. I guess if you keep supplies artificially low, have a good marketing dept, and send free samples to all those monkeys at those tech websites to create a ""buzz"", then you can justify this price. Anyhow, I shouldn't even complain as I got this free. My girlfriend won it at a conference.There are a few things that you should consider before getting this puppy. The battery life is NOT as advertised. My Ipod has never lasted more than 5 hours. The second thing is that iTune is hard to use. It is a bit counter intuitive compared to other similar programs out there. There are better programs out there that you can download.Save your money. Don't be a sheep."
1,Cool but definately not worth the price,"My father has one. It is cool. But seriously, who would pay 249 dollarsfor a pastel colored ipod that doesnt even carry as many songs as a 1G.People fell for that atrocious price. Get a 20 GB Click wheel. It gives you 16 GB of more songs for just 50 more dollars."
5,Excellent,"I'm a complete Mac addict. As soon as I saw the ipod, i fell in love. Waiting for a cheaper alternative to the 400 dollar 5GB version, I meant to get the 10GB, then the 15, then the 30, but I was extra cautious about how much I was spending. Then I saw the 4GB ipod mini. Perfect!!!!This is excellently engineered like all ipods, it's smaller. And you can pick your color instead of spending the extra $15 on iskin. Brilliant sound quailty. This combined with Harman Kardon Soundsticks 2 is the best stereo system I have ever used and heard.I also noticed the mini is faster than the 20GB click wheel version. Also check my review on the Harman Kardon Soundsticks 2."
5,oh my god you must crazy,this is the graetest mp3 player in the world and it is very cheap for it too. the battery is a bit rubbish but it is all great otherwise if you are thinking about buying this ipod make sure you do.jacobthank you
4,Check out the Windows Compatibility Specs before purchasing,"Love my new mini iPod but did not expect to pay an additional $100 to get it to work. Although headlines tout ""Windows Compatible"", pls read the technical specs before purchasing. I had Windows ME on my machine and had to upgrade to XP in order to use the device."
5,wow...,My ipod just broke so I have been looking at ipod minis and i have been playing with my sisters pink one and its soo cool!!!
1,BEWARE: Crashes windows xp.,"What a huge disappointment. The mini ipod brand new out of the box constantly crashed my computer whenever i plugged it in. I have a brand new computer, windows xp, 1 gig ram, 2 gig processor, 4 high power 2.0 usb connectors. I reloaded the software. I looked for help on all the websites. BEWARE WINDOWS USERS this crashed my xp over and over again. i took the machine back."
5,Ipod Mini is AWESOME!!!!!,"The mini is so cool.The reasons are it can hold why more songs than i will have, it comes in 5 colors and of course it was the first ipod to have the click wheel.That makes life so easy.I went down to the local apple store and checked out one of these and it was so cool."
1,NEVER EVER BUY ANOTHER APPLE PRODUCT,"MY IPOD BROKE IN A MONTH. APPLE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS THE WORST I HAVE EVER DEALT WITH. THEIR RETURN POLICY IS A REAL PAIN. I HAD TO SPEND OVER FOUR HOURS WITH THEM ON TWO DIFFERENT DAYS JUST TO GET THE IPOD RETURN FOR REPAIR. PLUS, THEY WERE VERY RUDE AND NASTY ON THE PHONE. I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER APPLE PRODUCT EVER AGAIN. IF YOU PURCHASE ONE, JUST PRAY THAT IT WORKS AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO SEND IT IN FOR REPAIR."
3,A bit confusing,"I found this hard going at first - probably because I skipped numbers 4 and 5 and ended up feeling a little bit behind. Still, it was concise and helpful."
5,All you need to know,Very detailed book on a subjectthat even contractors know littleabout. If you own real estate youreally should read this book.Excellent photos as well.Termite companies do not wantyou to see this excellent work!
3,Actually more like 2 & a half stars,"I've read all the books of Richard Laymon I can get my hands on, this book is the last of three I've never been able to find. So I was pretty excited when I saw it in a used bookstore.It's not as good as some of his other books (the traveling vampire show, resurrection dreams, come out tonight, and more). This one is a novella with short stories after. It's pretty much splatterpunk (which is Laymon's forte) but it lacks the plot or fleshed out characters I know he's capable of. I've enjoyed some of his books so much so I reccomend looking for his stuff. And as usual in Laymon's messed up world everyone is a rapist, murderer or just generally kooky. I'm still going to keep my eyes open for Funland & Quake, the only two of his books I haven't been able to find."
2,Gossipy politicially correct anecdotes,"The title of this book is misleading for two reasons. First, only a single short chapter covers the years before 1500.Second, it would be better titled ""Some Politically Correct, Gossipy Anecdotes from African Christianity"". Rather than writing a real history, the author gathers a few gossipy snippets from particular regions at specific times in history. Many of the anecdotes are political, about sexism, "" white racism"", colonism, or ism-ism. Any story about a woman may be included, no matter how minor her role in history. The faults of individual Christian missionaries are noted, perhaps with a guilt-by-association implication for the Christian religion in general. Any sort of bloodshed is considered sensational enough to be included, especially martyrdoms."
4,cool relief,"the ""cool bed"" provided some much needed relief for my big dog in the middle of our blazing west texas summer. required nothing on my part to get her to lay on the ""cool bed"" ... she seemed to like the cushion effect as well as the coolness. a little more guidance as to how much water to use would have been helpful. if i remember correctly the quantity of water was given in liters. when using a garden hose, kind of hard to gauge!"
5,BEST,"THIS IS NOT ONLY GOOD FOR PETS, ON HOT SUMMER DAYS IN AZ. YOU CAN PUT IT ON YOUR BACK TO COOL OFF, IT'S GREAT."
4,seems to really do its job,My 14 year old dog gets very warm when he sleeps and would become anxious and couldn't get comfortable. This bed seems to help him immensely and I'm very happy with it.
4,i like it but my dog doesnt :(,"I think this bed is great! when i put it on the ground and filled it with water i laid on it myself to test it out, and it actually feels very cool and does its job....however, the only problem is my dog, an australian shepherd, won't use it. I've had a few weeks now and he refuses to lay on it. Which is disappointing because i live in Florida and it gets so hot when we go for our walks. Maybe in time he will warm up to it. Otherwise I am still rating pretty high because I believe this would be a great bed for a dog who would actually use it. It seems easy to clean, has a nice cushion feel and does stay cool. :)"
3,Leaks after one summer,"My small pug used this everyday in the summer, but then it developed a tear in the seam and started to leak on my carpet. I had to throw it out and am debating whether to buy this product again given the poor construction."
1,Do not get this book.,Do not get this book. The Author is a total nut case. I threw it away. Would rate with no stars if possible.
1,"Nice flashlight, BUT NOT FOR WATER!","Bought this flashlight for the purpose of snorkling. Works great at first.... even works underwater (for a short time). The problem that I can see is that in order to activate the light, you must slightly unscrew and screw the main housing where the batteries go in order for the light to come on and off. This causes slight leakage and destroys the contacts and batteries. Piss poor design! Anything that is made for underwater should have a different activation switch without compromising the seal for internal parts. Would not recommend this flashlight for underwater purposes... keep looking."
2,Bright but Cheap,"It's a really really bright flashlight, but drains the batteries in a couple of hours. You get what you pay for..."
1,DON'T BUTY IT!,"I BOUGHT THIS SINK BECAUSE IT WAS THE ONLY ONE I FOUND THAT WOULD FIT THE OPENING. I NEED THE LONG MEASUREMENT TO BE FROM RIGHT TO LEFT AND THE SHORT MEASUREMENT TO BE FRONT TO BACK....I EVEN CALLED THE HELP LINE BECAUSE THE MEASUREMENT ON SINKS IS SO VERY CONFUSING....WHAT DOES LENGTH AND WIDTH MEAN? SO THE HELP LINE REP. WENT TO THE SINK SITE AND FOUND THAT THEY DESCRIBE THE MEASUREMENTS BY ACTUALLY SAYING ""FRONT TO BACK AND RIGHT TO LEFT""..........GREAT!! SINK ARRIVED WITH OPPOSITE MEASUREMENTS FROM WHAT I WAS TOLD AND IT WAS NOT THE PICTURE SHOWN...SO DON'T BUY IT IF YOU WANT THE ITEM PICTURE SHOWN!"
2,Mediocre,"I really thought I was going to like this book. Twenty-something New York writer Rachel is engaged to her long term boyfriend, now all they have to do is plan a wedding and deal with their friends and family's craziness.A large part of the book is devoted to her parents' issues with the wedding, the finances of it, as well as her difficult mother and stepmother. During the first half of the book, the interaction with her parents moved the story along, but by the end it was just repetitive. True to life maybe, but a bit boring.At the end of the book, Rachel's friends who were less than supportive of the wedding were written off as being jealous which I found pat and condescending. The author never explores the possibility that some of their friends might not be marriage-minded or that anyone could just be tired about hearing about the wedding. Everyone's just jealous of Rachel.As far as bride-to-be books, I preferred Diary of a Mad Bride."
2,very boring,"I struggled to get through this one. It was a bit boring and tedious. There's only so much one can read about people complaining about parents, future in-laws, wedding details, etc. It needed a little more movement. This book wasn't horrible, just boring. Also, since I'm not Jewish, I felt that I needed a Yiddish glossary in the back to make sense of a lot of stuff.Read either one of Cara Lockwood's books instead for a better read."
2,Not a complete guide,"This guide has the basic walkthrough up to the Elite Four. But as other reviewers have noted, the book is rife with small errors and stops abruptly when detailing the end of the game. The largest omission is the exclusion of -any- mention of how to recieve the National Pokedex or how to travel to Islands 4, 5, 6, and 7. This is not a small extra area of the game, it is several more hours of gameplay and isn't even mentioned. Pokemon completists will be dissapointed with Prima's guide."
2,Disappointed!,"Let me join the rest of these guys indicating my disappointment with this book.There's just too much left out. I think these guys were rushed, and put out what they had at the time, but there is way too much left out to make purchasing this worthwhile.The pokedex is okay, so I'll give it two stars for that. But the walkthroughs totally stink."
1,This guide is garbage!,"I bought this guide along with the game, and I have regretted it since day one. The guide not only leaves out pertinent details (such as how to evolve certain Pokemon, where/how to catch certain pokemon, etc, etc, etc), but is also flat out wrong in some cases (It notes Lickitung under ""Fighting"" type when in reality it is ""Normal"", and many other examples). The book really seems like it was a very quickly and sloppily done writeup and leaves MANY questions unanswered.Very Unhappy Prima, get your act together please."
1,Blecch!,"This is such a dumb guide. Never buy it. If you do, you will have to rip it in just like five minutes. So never buy this or else! I went to toys r us, but several weeks after I bought it, it went straight to the garbage pile, and I got the Nintendo guide. That had everything! So far I haven't found one mistake! Maybe there was 1 type-o, but who cares? That guide was awesome! If you want to beat the Elite Four, you shouldn't even get the Prima! Instead of having easy events it has ""cheat sheets."" That just says go left. go right. go up. get the item ball. (wow!)I really don't know Pokemon's numbers! This guide doesn't show the Pokedex in alphabetical order, but Nintendo Power shows them in alphabetical order. You know, it has a Snotedex! That's was Crabbiest said in the NintendoPower review.This guide is a big waste of money. Don't buy it."
5,"Great playing from Bobby, Joe, Bob, and Bill! WOW!!","This disc is fantastic. Would expect this from such a great lineup. But what makes the whole thing swing is the top arranging of wonderful music from Earl Zindars creative writing chops. The title track sure; Elsa, of course, especially in the hands of Bobby Shew. But dig the other less familiar tunes from EZ: Silverado Trail, Mother of Earl, City Tune and Return to Love, especially. Would that Bill Evans had his turn at these with, say, Tom Harrell, Larry Schneider, and say Marc Johnson as on We Will Meet Again. This disc is THAT good. Melodic, touching, cerebral and melancholic at once. And don't leave out fine bass work from Jeff D'Angelo and Cunliffe's harmonies enhanced with the trombone of Bruce Paulson. Both players are alumni of the Doc Severinsen band. All very sweet stuff. My favorite being Bill's fine dissonant chord treatment of Elsa with Bobby's flugelhorn on top."
4,Good quality,I used it to replace a Delta that lasted for 15 years. It works well and I hope it lasts for the same 15 year time frame. Only time will tell!
3,Toones,"Great toons, great era for creation. I wish they would have shortened all the pre & post toon credits. Too much times is given for that."
3,GOOD BUT NOT GREAT!,"THE CARTOONS AND EXTRAS ON THIS DISK LOOK GREAT, BUT FOR THE MONEY PAID I THINK THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A LOT MORE LOONEY TUNES ON THESE DISK BECAUSE A LOT OF GREAT STUFF IS MISSING. WHAT'S THE RUSH DOC? WHERE IS ""WHAT'S OPERA DOC?"" I KNOW THERE IS A LOT MORE FOGHORN LEGHORN THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ON THIS COLLECTION AMONG MANY OTHER THINGS AND THERE COLD HAVE BEEN A WHOLE LOT MORE YOSEMITE SAM, MARVIN THE MARTIAN BUT THERE JUST IS NOT ENOUGH. LOT'S OF STUFF MISSING AND I HOPE THAT THEY WILL MAKE IT TO DVD SOON AND MAYBE WITH A MORE AFFORDABLE PRICE TAG."
4,Patience please!,"Hey, any Looney Tunes release by WB on DVD is worth it. Fans have been clamoring for these for a long time now. No, it is not an all inclusive collection but it is good. Let it be known that WB does have plans for future releases of additional Looney Tunes DVD collections. Be patient. You'll see most of your favorites, however, I am unsure about the ""banned"" cartoons. I think it would be ludicrous not to have them, they are a part of WW II cultural history as anything else."
4,ONE FROGGY EVENING...,"Not only does it not contain two of my favorites, One Froggy Evening and, as was mentioned in another review What's Opera Doc, there are many other ones, the names of which escape me ... the one with the Dog, Belvedere ""Belvedere, come here boy1"" etc. I can only hope they will be included on a future DVD."
3,WHAT???? No Little Red Riding Hood???,"HOW could you have a definitive collection and leave out the best episode??? WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?????C'mon!Red: Hey GRAND-MA, That's an awfully big nose for you.... TA HAVE!!!""Wolf: ""yea yea yea, big nose, big nose""Red: Hey GRAND-MA, Those are awfully big TEETH for you.... TA HAVE!""C'mon!!!!!!"
3,No cueing points!!!!!,"Warner Brothers made one huge, juicy mistake on this otherwise wonderful cartoon collection: there are not individual cueing points for the 'toons, just a ""watch all"" selection. So if I want to watch the 10th cartoon on the 3rd DVD, let's say, my only resort is to select ""watch all"" and then use the ""skip"" button to try to zero in on #10. This is a major omission--thumbs down, WB!"
4,Cartoon classics,This collection has the big red monster cartoons that I was looking for. Hard to do because I don't know the names of the cartoons.My kids (10 and 7) and I love these cartoons. Great for the DVD player in the car/plane.
4,A little disappointed....,"While I think most of us here grew up on Looney Tunes and cherish the memories.... I don't know if I'm alone in that I think after 6 box sets in the Golden Collection series that there were several discs of Bugs and Daffy but not a lot of the other characters. I get they were main characters, but where are all the Foghorn Leghorn, Sylvester & Tweety, Yosemite Sam and Wile E Coyote/Road Runner. I know there is a seperate disc out right now for Foghorn Leghorn and others. I just think at the prices being charged for the series, that they all should be well represented in the collections. Hopefully when the next series is to be released, this will be corrected."
4,"Good product, reasonable price",I like this product because it seems to cut down on irritation after using an epilator for hair removal and doesn't have an unbearable smell (but it could be better - smells a bit like a burning motor). Large bottle-good value for the money and a little goes a very long way.
3,Runs small,"I ordered the medium size for a baby turning 1. They were too small. He is a rather large baby, however. (Tall)"
3,Great booties but careful washing,I love the booties and they kept my son's feet warm but the first time I washed them (delicate in our front load washer) the seam of one of the booties opened so I can't really use them anymore :(
4,"Informative, but dated.","Both this book and it's sister, Volume 1, contain a great selection of techniques and designs to answer your ""How do I ...?"" questions on stage construction. They cover many aspects, from costumes and makeup, to rigging and platform construction. There are undoubtedly things I will use or make in the future that will come from these books. The shortfall is that these were compiled some time ago and do not contain any mention or use of computers, nor are any url's referenced. Google searches for some of the companies mentioned were successful, but in some cases the manufacturer has moved on to other products."
1,I don't like it for architects,"I really didn't like it for architects. I was work on a theater project, but it is so mechanical. Nothing for architects. No color pictures, only b&w draws."
4,clean cat genie,"Delivery was prompt. What can I say about the cat cleaning solution? It does a fine job, though, I think I will try the unscented solution next."
3,OK Glue Gun,Ok for small projects...glue gets messy. The stand doesn't really help much. The gun does work and the glue sticks are a nice bonus for starters.
1,THIS ORDER COMPLETELY SUCKED!!!!!,"I PURCHASED THIS MOVIE AND IT TOOK ABOUT 2 WEEKS TO GET HERE, ONLY TO FIND OUT THAT I CAN NOT PLAY THE DVD ON MY PLAYER BECAUSE IT IS THE WRONG REGION!!! I TRIED TO RETURN IT AND WAS ADVISED THAT i COULD NOT RETURN THE DVD!!!! NOW I HAVE A DVD THAT I CAN NOT WATCH!!!! THIS SUCKS!!!!"
1,A Lake full of sewer water,This is a cute story - but Ricki Lake's mouth turns it intosewage. What story line requires F - F - F and J C - seemslike this was her attempt at adding dialog? her personalseptic touch?
2,jim fixx,the first advocate for running and jogging for health reasons! who died of a heart attack while running . ironic?? i think a bit.
3,"Not terribly interesting, dated jazz lite EXCEPT for the appearance of Wayne Krantz","The players on this date are all top-notch, but the tunes are somewhat dated and kind of meh - it's jazz/rock lite ala Spyrogyra or the Yellowjackets. But it's elevated when Wayne Krantz solos. Wayne is just a superb and unique guitar player, even this far back in his career. His own composition, ""Five Years,"" is the standout."
2,disappointed,"I was bummed out to find that the book, paperback, was bent when it arrived. I bought this to give a s gift, and after putting it under a heavy book for several days had to give up and give a different book. I would recommned that this seller ship paperback books with better protection or a stiff piece of cardboard etc."
2,"No son, the bum in the park is _not_ a suitable playmate!","A child loses his teddy; it is found by a park derelict; who meets and becomes friends with the boy despite the obvious discomfort of the boy's parents. BZZZTTT!!! David McPhail picked the wrong year to write a book about warm, fuzzy homeless people. Why didn't he make the other character a poor child, or a lonely soldier on station far from home, or something like that? In this year of appalling, highly-publicized child abductions, the lesson couldn't be any clearer: children should be instructed to view street people as dangerous until proven otherwise. If McPhail wants to join the ranks of those who make mascots of these people, that's his business. But it is the height of irresponsibility to teach unsuspecting children to do the same."
4,how to become a teenage ninja/good video,this is a good movie for begginers cuz it just teaches the basics. it teaches u two basic kiks and blocks and the breathing tachniques and a good amount more but the only thing is that it says teenage ninja but in it theres little kids but its a good movie for teaching u beggining steps and all and i like it.
4,Nice Book,This is a very nice book for someone that is new to orchids. Very helpful to properly take care of my new plant.
2,The book was ok i guess,"....I saw all the good ratings so i reconsidered giving this book more stars but i just can not. I really didn't get much out of this. It wasn't like a practical book about you learning how to communicate with spirits, it was more of a book about spirits and people who dealt with them. I'll give it 2 stars because i suppose there were interesting pictures of spirits and ectoplasm and such but that's all this book will get from me."
2,good concept but dosent really work,"I think this is a great concept and I like the golf design but they are worthless. They are tiny and they fall right off the second they move. My little guy is a wiggle worm, as most babies are, and these never stayed on."
2,Cute...but wouldn't recommend,"Too small, not heavy enough, so they don't stay in place. Good for a laugh, but not much else."
2,Dont waste your money!,"These are so tiny! We tried to use them, but they barely cover anything! You are better off having a larger piece if cloth or a cloth diaper handy to really save yourself from getting drenched and preventing a larger mess.These are o tiny that by the time you fumble for them, the accident is in progress!"
1,Doesn't arrive in one piece,I order this shovel and had to ask for a replacement twice. Each time the shovel arrived with a broken handle. I gave up and ask for a refund. Can't say how good it works because I never got a chance to use it.
2,Handle Issues,"Handle came broke, ordered a new one. Broke 2 minutes in to using it. Ordered another same thing. I recommend drilling a few screws in to the handle and some duct tape to fix this issue. Other than that shovel works like a charm."
2,review on A Long Road to Motherhood,"This book kinda draged in the first couple of chapters, of which i skipped it was boring but got interestions after the first 3 chapters ok book"
1,Not Broadway-stay with broadway cast,"I bought this CD because it was cheaper and was a musical highlight, not the whole score (which I tend to pick out the good stuff from Broadway musicals - alot is just getting the story across.) I was very disappointed in the quality of the voices and the score presentation. Apparently London has different sounds, or requirements for excellence. I quickly ordered the original broadway cast score and felt better. In my opinion the two are not compariable. I have read other reviews and and others loved this highlight cd. Compare for yourself and and see if you want to save money. It cost me twice the amount-paying for both."
3,"A big WOW, but BLUE LIGHT SPECIAL","Strengths: Excellent picture and amazing sound. Lots of inputs. Built-In HD tuner. Universal Remote is a big plus. Very nice clean lines.Weaknesses: BLUE LIGHT SPECIAL! Light around power switch illuminates whole dark room when off! WHAT WERE THEY THINKING? Manual in multilanguages is very large.Summary: Yes, screen is beautiful and sound is much better than prior lnr328w version. I really like that the black triangle area below the display on the 328w was dropped for a clean even straight bezel. The hidden speakers produce great sound. DUMB DESIGN: BRIGHT blue circle light around power switch makes set look like a cheap gamebox. Previous version didn't have this DUMB design. Why fix what wasn't broken? Guess designers never put one in a bedroom. Manual is quite thorough, and an inch thick and heavy due to multilanguages. Why not bind each language seperately? Only power/miniplug audio/antenna cables provided."
4,ALOTTA MINSTERL for the money,"CD, Christmas CD, & a DVD The BEST part is the DVD 5 songs from a castle concert. WE THREE KINGS on the Christmas cd is Real Nice. The CD 14 tracks a few new ones, Spirit of the sea I like the best.A VERY NICE COLLECTION !"
3,Nothing special - can't figure the Washington Post raves,"It's pretty rare that any romantic novel scores raves in the Washington Post. I, quite honestly, am baffled as to what is in this novel to make it stand out and deserve this treatment. There are many other romances which are much more deserving.Not that this is a bad read - it's just a predictible, formula novel. It includes many cliche plot twists - trapped by a snow storm in a cabin, hero who doesn't think he deserves to be loved, etc. As a Bay Area native (with four grandparents who all remembered the 1906 earthquake vividly), the history is pretty shakey also. Likewise, while I'm not a fan of any malicious characters, this book has two sources of threats. One is reasonably necessary for the plot but the other one is simply annoying.Bottom line -- not a waste of time but hardly extraordinary."
4,Lots of Possibilities,"I bought this translator for a trip to Greece. I wanted an electronic translator instead of a phrase book for convenience and weight limitations in the carry-on. This was one of the few translators, and most reasonably priced, that included Greek in their language options. I liked that the Greek and Cyrillic alphabets were displayed in the responses for Greek and Russian - not just English pronunciations. I did not unfortunately, use the language translator very much - it was easier to speak English when possible (and it was usually possible). It has several additional features that make the purchase worthwhile - a world time clock, calculator, telephone directory, and conversion calculator which was very handy when dealing in the metric system. I wouldn't use this device without prior knowledge of the language, you shouldn't assume every response is correct. There are enough extras on the translator to make it a handy assistant if you know how to use it."
5,Nice.,"Applied Therapeutics is a very detailed, thorough, and informative compilation of assorted health care matters.The text is easy to read and the numerous sample cases studies in each chapter ensures that the reader fully understands and is able to apply the information presented. It is also an excellent method to reinforce the enormous amount of information health care providers are presented with in daily practice.The free CD-ROM (which you must request on their website with a coupon code attached in the back of the book) is a very portable version of this hefty textbook.A word of caution: This is defintely not an ""introductory"" book. A little working knowledge of biology, pharmacology, and disease states is a must.Overall, awesome textbook for interning students."
4,Book of Birthdays,The book came in good condition although missing the entire cover the pages and hard cover book showed only minor signs of damage which were mostly on the hard cover.
4,Good stuff!,"I saw this book in a waiting room. I came to amazon.com immediately to get it for myself. Although entertaining and informative, this paperback version is different than the hard cover version that I had seen originally."
2,Cruden's Compact Concordance,"I have an old version of Curden's Complete Concordance (1st printing 1967) that I like much better, but it has completely fallen apart. It has the Scripture references on the right of the colums and is much easier to read."
3,I have some amazing chewing dogs,I have four dogs that can chew up anything but we have two of these toys that are still intact. They get bored once the scent of the biscuit inside is gone but other that they are really indestructible. We have had them since August.
5,Indestructable,Our 15 lb. puppy and his razor teeth chew through every toy. This one is hanging there TOUGH!
2,Not for aggresive chewers at all.,I thought it would be good for my aggressive chewing APBT. Although he destroys ALL toys ... This one had one of the shortest lives.
1,Broke First Day,I bought this for my Pit Bull and the first day of having it he had it destroyed. It tore apart and all the rubber pieces broke apart after on band was broke. I expected it to last a little longer being it said large dog toy.. Sad disappointment!
2,Not a high quality product,"I bought this for my 13 pound dog and it lasted her about 2 weeks! I had bought her one like this at a department store and it was very sturdy, my dog loved it and it lasted for about 2 years. When it was time to replace it I ordered this one but the quality was not the same!"
1,not for chewers,my dog chewed this toy up and tried to eat little pieces of it. not a good toy to leave with your dog unsupervised.
1,AVOID! Very poorly constructed and weak toy.,"My dog destroyed this toy in less than 3 minutes, literally! The pieces came apart immediately the first time I threw the ball and it hit the ground it broke apart at the seem. When the dog picked it up and shook it around more seems broke. The 2nd throw and dog retrival ended this toy all together. It is now in 12 pieces and completely unusable. I'm very disappointed and do not recommend this product at all!"
1,Does not stand up to large dogs,"I have two large dogs. This was one of their gifts this year. Within seconds, literally, this rubber ball was in shreds. I was stunned as other items of this nature have held up well (other brands). It says for ""large dogs"" but I would not recommend this at all. Save your money and go for Kong or other tried and true item."
1,so cute,"This is a cute toy, I guess for a little toy type dog. My dobermans got a hold of it and it was falling apart in minutes. It's value probobly depends on your dog."
2,(T_T) What's wrong with Nobbly Wobbly ?,I agree with some of the other reviewers. My Pups just wouldn't touch this toy. I roll it around and did everything to get them interested in it but they just didn't find it interesting. I even took it apart by cutting the rings and using heavy duty tape to reconnect each star-shaped piece and thought maybe they'd use it as a Teether. But that didn't even give them interest. I just threw it away and got them their old trusty Tennis Balls which they got nuts for. I'd just say stick with the old trusty than going fancy !
2,Broke 1st day,"Let me start off by saying my dog is around 45 pounds and tears up normal toys very easily. This one appeared to be very durable, however it tore up within the first few minutes of my dog playing with it. I thought it would be great to hide treats it, but several of the tubes broke, so now nothing will stay inside it."
2,Destroyed!,"My dog is a 22-lb ""power chewer"" and decimated this quickly. If you use the black Kongs, pass this by. Recommend the Hol-ee Roller instead, she hasn't been able to put a dent in that yet."
1,Garbage,"This toy is complete garbage. I bought it for my small rat terrier, and he had it in a dozen or more pieces in less than an hour. Obviously, dog toys can't be expected to last forever, but I do expect better than that. I was so disappointed in this toy, I complained to the company that made it. Their response? ""Tough.""If you want a good, rugged toy your dog will have for a long time, choose something from a quality company like Chuckit, Kong, Premier, Nylabone, etc. Multipet is a terrible company that produces shoddy products and even worse customer service."
4,Fun to go back in times.,This is a great DVD for grandkids and one that I enjoy myself. Its like going back 50 years in time. Quality is very good considering the age of the material they had to work with to generate the new DVD.
5,Cartoons,A blast from the past. Not the junk thats now on TV. Guess ya just have to be old to enjoy these.
2,Hold out for the Golden Collection!,"Several reviewers have warned against buying the Spotlight Collection...and I'm jumping on the bandwagon. Please do not buy this collection; all 28 cartoons here are featured in the Golden Collection, Vol. 1, which also features gems from the 50's.Hold out for the Goldens!"
4,Good condition..,"Girlfriend loved it, in good condition. Discs skip around some, don't always play cartoons in order, but they all work."
5,fun for all ages,"These cartoons are classics. They have inspired generations of your people. They are nostalgic for adults and entertaining for children. Plus, they employ various types of classical music to stimulate a young mind."
3,Misses the upbeat spirit of New Wave.,"I had high hopes for this CD but was somewhat disappointed. To me, the spirit of ""new wave"" was fun and pop -- the bright side of punk.But this CD tends to be cynical and downbeat - more like what I'd expect from punk.But, if you have a programmable CD player or MP3 player, there are a few songs that deserve to be in a custom mix."
1,In no way is this book for beginners,If you don't have prior programing experience then RUN FAR FAR away from this bookthe author just throws out jargon without explaining itIf you don't already know how to us C++ you will be totally lost as I wasRIP OFF
2,Unfit title,"Although this book serves as a good reference, I found it to be far from clearly explained. It was difficult to follow, and poorly written."
1,Don't Bother with This Book,If your looking to learn TCP/IP I would look elsewhere. This book did nothing to explain it clearly. It was a total waste of my money.
4,Top-Notch Networking Text!,"I have the earlier, 1st edition version of ""TCP/IP For Everyone"". Assuming this is the same book, it's one of the best computer books I've ever read (and I've read a lot of 'em). A great introduction to networking for anyone who's interested- you don't need to be a techie to understand this one. I am ordering several copies for my office and will probably give a lecture based on it for my department. The title of this book is very appropriate. I highly recommend it, and am looking forward to see what's been added in this new edition."
4,Some Progress,"I've only been taking this for about a month, but my thinning hair seems to be coming in a little fuller. I'm 22 with slightly gray/ thinning hair and military, so I don't have A LOT of hair, but what hair I do have seems to be making progress. I say buy it and try it."
3,Average,"That has been ""dermatologist recommended"" product. Have been using for about 4-5 years. It's not like my hair started to grow right away - but I would say it got better a little bit. But I would recommend to use Elon Matrix Complete (with multivitamins: same for the hair + vitamins."
5,harpsichord,"copy by Michael Johnson after harpsichord by Jean Goermans & Pascal Taskin, 1764 & 1783Non si tratta quindi di un cembalo originale, ma l'esecuzione di Maggie Cole è come sempre di altissimo livello."
1,Uhggggg.,"I have to agree with the other reviews who gave this book 1 star. The writing is horrible, not dynamic at all. In addition, what i have read so far seems mostly to be a series of quotes, paragraph after paragraph...a ""he-said-she-said"" kind of thing and because of that i can't even identify the plot/story. Very maddening. Maybe it gets better later on but i'll never know as i can't continue reading it. Too bad...it's probably an interesting story."
2,A disappointment,"I am still struggling with this book because I whole-heartedly agree with 'A Reader' in US about how they 'distinguished themselves by their dishonesty,willingness to sleep their way to the top, ability to take other women's husbands and extraordinary self-centeredness.' While I enjoyed Kitty Carlisle Hart and Constance Baker Motley, I shake my head as I read about the others. Please don't excuse their behavior because 'it was a different time'. Integrity is integrity and while some of these women accomplished some wonderful things, their journeys are not to be celebrated. Rather, here is how NOT to be a great dame."
2,Interesting...not great,"Great Dames profiles the lives of ten prominant women who emerged during a time when women were not thought to have much influence. With the exception of Constance Baker Motley ,Kitty Carlisle Hart and her own mother, these women seem to excelled in marrying well, sleeping with the right person and being born into socially or politically connected families. While their stories are facinating and present insight into a time since gone, they are bittersweet and unsatisfying."
1,Doesn't work,Not worth your $$ for it. Mole continued to make holes in ground. Simply doesn't do it's job. Find something else.
3,Works ok,My dad uses this. It helps with the moles and does work but by no means is it a cure all. Moles are hard to get rid of.
2,Don't expect much,"This book is nothing like her other fun books. If you are looking for an alphabet book just for the letters go for it. There is no story here, like I was expecting, just nonsence words for each letter."
4,The Immensity of Time,"Most of the other reviews have covered both the good and the bad about this book, so I just wanted to mention one thing: time. I have never read a book, either fiction or non-fiction that so successfully conveyed the utter enormity of time within which we evolve. With his story lines of various animals and people and then a few million years later their genetic relatives and the changes, or lack thereof, evokes such a profound sense of the immensity of time. I felt, as a conscious, abstract-thinking, tool-using, relative of all life that has proceeded me, a sense of great humility and insignificance. But this was also accompanied by such a profound sense of awe: that all of this life simply is; immense unending Being, becoming."
5,progressive learning,This guide continues to be invaluable as a supplement to classes or on its own. Ms. Horowitz lays out the process for painting little gems of watercolor for beginners or more practiced painters. I refer to it often for the tips which continue to improve my technique. Beautifully done.
5,good product and great pricing,Worked well and my problem corrected to my satisfaction. It came as described and this experience was good. I recommend this vendor if you need to order this item.
3,The reason I buy these is because I have to......,"The cabinets that are in my home use these hinges. As it turns out there is a piece of plastic in the hinge that gives it it's self closing ability. It works great.........for about 7-10 years. One day it will break and at that point the self closing ability will be gone. Thank goodness for companies that sell this replacement piece, you will need it at some point. It is easy to replace. It takes about 2 min/hinge and you only need the half on the door. ""German Engineering"" is supposed to be the standard by which others are measured. If that is the case, then I am really disappointed."
4,Simple presentation of important information,"I needed this book when I was a new pastor. It took two years to get to the point where we could back up, and tend to the issues presented simply and thoughtfully in this book. Farris, an insightful consultant and forward thinker, grounds his book in love for the congregant, God and the pastor herself. The human condition does not escape the sanctuary, and Farris provides gentle reminders of that fact. He does not shy away from issues such as adultery (read the last chapter) and the problem makers, but faces these issues with a gentleness that gives respect to the humanity within the issues. Farris could go deeper and sharper with his insights, yet the end result is a book of thoughtful wisdom, that can lead to pastoral and congregational health."
3,Netting is thin and fragile.,"I like these bags but when they are snagged on a nail or screw, they will tear. Only good for smooth objects as shown in the product images. Good draw string and good to see through."
5,No Worries,"After reading other reviews about size issues I was very hesitant to buy this set, but I went against my normal thought process and got it anyway. It was a good move. I have a 1998 Nissan Altima and these fit securely with no problems. I'm a delivery driver as well and after speeding around for the week they have not popped off even after the occasional pothole.These hubcaps do look better than I expected. They arrived quickly via Amazon Prime and arrived with no defects, chipping or any other cosmetic problems. For $25, you will be getting more than what you paid for."
3,Nice wheel covers but a TIGHT fit,"These wheel covers seem to be made of a pretty tough plastic and have a steel retaining ring in them. However, they didn't fit my 15"" wheels very well and I ended up cracking two of them while trying to put them on. For that reason, I'd have a hard time recommending them. Once they are on, they stay on and look good."
3,"Nice glasses, I hope their joints would be as good as their body","Nice glasses, I hope their joints would be as good as their body. Feels flimsy to me but maybe I am picky!! For $3, it worth. I liked very clear lenses that does not give headache."
3,Ok For The Money,"Distortion wise they are good, did not notice any uneven areas. But I have never owned a pair that fogged up so quickly. Spend a few extra bucks and get a pair with anti-fog. These are pretty much worthless to me since I am blind within a minute of putting them on."
5,I don't have time to enjoy myself,"I bought a PDA to keep my busy life organised (Jornada 545).I discovered e-books.I discovered Risen - free!!I discovered that I had even less spare time.I discovered that I was reading a piece of fiction for the first time in years and years.This book is superb. The humour, the word pictures, the excitement, the twists and turns, the immediate involvement in the storyline and the characters.... Everything is just so beautifully crafted.Jan please no more!! - I simply do not have time to enjoy myself.But many, many thanks for the experience."
5,Really great thriller! Couldn't put it down,Really a great read - grabs your attention from the get-go. Well done - I hope there are more like this to come.
5,Fun from the past.,I do love a great comedy and this is one of the best. The part two is as funny as part one.
4,Classic Laugh,"I liked Three Men and a Baby. But I LOVED this movie! It had me laughing non-stop. More than that, it had my MOTHER laughing non-stop. She actually bought the video for me one year but maintained a perpetual state of borrowing it from me. I finally told her to keep it. Now, I think it's time I upgraded her to a DVD version! Definitely worth watching and, for me, definitely worth purchasing."
1,THIS GUY IS A RACIST,"HOW MANY BOOKS IS THIS GUY GOING TO WRITE ABOUT SAME SUBJECT with a different title? This guy is what is wrong with the US Army....He is a RACIST. Just because he can't explain why East Asians (Chinese, Japanese, Koreans...etc)don't fit into his so called profile, he dismisses the cultures as ""robotons or bunch or robots"". what a bunch of flawed thinking and explanation is this? I can't believe this guys served in the US Army for so long and corrupted so many young officers minds with this trash...raising another generation of RACIST and proliferating this ideology. AMAZING THIS GUY."
4,Casio Women's Classic Round Analog Watch #LQ139D-9B1,"i love the sleek elegent look of this watch, it arrived in perfect condition except for one thing it was not working when i got it am going to take it and have the battery replaced and see if that fixes it, i love the light weight feel of this watch and think it will be very comfortable to wear."
1,Died after only 5 weeks,"Since a new battery, if that's what the problem is, costs just about as much as the watch did, I decided it wasn't worth pursuing. Very disappointing."
4,My wife loves it absolutely!,"Yes, it's true. My wife loves this simple but elegant watch, I greatly recommend it."
4,Good reference guide,"I listened to the audio of this book 1st, then purchased. Alot of eye opener things you may not know you were doing. Wanted the book so could reference back whenever want."
1,The Ultimate Guide to a Thin Wallet,Dr. Phil is a disgrace to his profession. This book is just another way for a TV personality to make a buck. It's a way for Dr. McGraw to grab a piece of the billion dollar diet industry hoax...you think you know what it's like Dr. Phil to be really fat?...guess again. Your book has been written before many times and in many different versions by many different people. Maybe you just packaged it differently or perhaps on the laurels of your recent TV exposure you will sell a million copies!
3,Subject good but print too small,"I just received a copy and, while I haven't had a chance to put the suggestions into practice, I wanted to say that I was disappointed in the format. The print is really too small for me to read comfortably. It would have been much more helpful had it printed in the same way the ""Chicken Soup For The Soul"" books are, with larger print and better quality pages. So, my advice would be if you have trouble reading because the print is too small, maybe you should consider another type of food guide or check to see if this title can be purchased with larger print."
1,Don't waste your $$$ and time,"Why would you take diet advice from a fat guy?It's like listening to Richard Simmons for exercise advice. You don't want to look like him, so why would you buy his workout tapes?"
3,An o.k book,"While this book defenatly has it's Moment, The odor of Dr.PhilsSelf-glorification clealry smells."
1,tired dribble,"I read this book while sitting at my local Barnes and Nobles in about 1 hour. The easy of which I read this book is its only asset. The content however was the same lacluster dribble we have been hearing for years. Would it shock you the main premise of the book is your have to live a healthier live?!? If I wrote this same book, I would not sell more than a dozen copies. Dr. Phil mistakes common sense for originality. COmmon on folks we all know what we have to do in order to lose weight. Most of us just do not want the bother... Please save your money on this title and go for a walk, for as Dr. Phil says ""walking is the best source for weight loss""...duh!?!..."
2,Insulting,"I thought I'd find some helpful insights in this book. There is nothing new here. This is the same message we've always heard in new packaging. That's not to say the message is wrong (diet, exercise, behavior modification). Unfortunately, this packaging includes McGraw making insulting comments on nearly every page. Comments like getting ""your fat behind"" to the gym and other remarks are insulting to people who struggle with a not-simple-to-solve problem. Perhaps the author thinks that this is part of his well-known 'folksy' style. I was offended, however. Not recommended."
2,Sad Day in Weight Loss,"Dr. Phil is definitely good at relationships, but he is not the type of person who should be writing about weight loss. All I got out of this book was some basic information and the encouragement to do the things that get most people fat in the first place. I should have known better, after all Dr. Phil is not in that good of shape himself. In short, I purchased this book because he is a celebrity and unfortunately, it lacks in depth and credibility. The food he recommends is not healthy and this book is nothing short of a quick way for Dr. Phil to make more money preying on fat people."
3,Ok book,"This is an OK book. Pretty easy read and it doens't take a rocket scientist to decode it but it is just OK. Kinda long at points but he does a good job at putting it on the common mans language. I ahve read better books like ""Body By God"""
5,This is the Ultimate Weight Loss Solution!!,This book is a sure thing for anyone who is looking for the root of their eating problems. This book explores the reason why we eat and the habits we need to change in order to succeed in defeating those habits. With the help of this book I have lost 30 pounds. It is amazing when you do some real soul searching and read EVERY PAGE of this book what determination you will find in yourself!! Dr. Phil is right on!!!
1,The Weight Loss Food Guide,"I cannot rate this order because I had to pay for something I did not order. Lifeintheword, sent me the wrong book and have not acknowledged, vast amount of email stating they sent the wrong book. I am not please to pay for somthing I did order and cannot use. I am not pleased. I have written email but to no avial the problem has not been rectified. Amazon I have ordered several things with you. It is causing me to question if I should remain being a customer. I have been please up until this order.Thanks in advance for listening.-Bonnie Murkeldove"
3,This book is ok!,"I think this book is well-written and helpful, however, for someone who is very weak in the self-control department, they should seek other avenues to help them overcome their weakness. Self-Hypnosis, along with the education in this book helped me, but only after reading it 3x and practicing self-hypnosis"
3,Chewing the fat with Phil,"This books is a platform for motivational speaking. It has wonderful ideas, however, it's up to the reader to implement them."
5,Where's Season 2?,Every single episode was hilarious. The three characters were perfectly cast. Hilarious !!! I'm hoping wildly that we'll get a season 2.
4,Fiance Loves It!,I had never seen the show on tv but my fiance had and loved it. I perchased it and I have only watched one episode and that is enough for me. I was not impressed with it but he loves it. So it was for him and as long as he thinks its great then that works for me!!!
4,One word - WOW!,"I usually hate workout videos because they're slow and repetitious. Tae-Bo, on the other hand, is fast-paced, different and loads of fun. I've never sweated so much and acutally enjoyed it! I've tried almost everything: gyms, aerobics classes, drastic diets, but nothing has helped me tone down as much as Tae-Bo has. Thank you!!!"
3,It's not terrible,"This video does provide a great workout. You sweat and tone a lot of body parts. The only bad part of this video is Billy himself. He seems to be a really nice guy and I admire him for coming up with moves but he talks entirely too much. The fact that I have the video and am playing it means that I am motivated enough to do the workout. I do not need anyone lecturing me on motivation, spiritality or the like. If Billy would just stop giving trite speeches on asking for a god's help and show us the correct forms (the people behind all have slightly different forms), it would be more helpful."
3,Advanced Tae Bo fails to adequately explain each exercise.,"This tape has a lot of potential. However, most of the moves are poorly explained. There is way too much ""preaching"" instead of explanations by Blanks. The individuals doing the exercises with him seem to frequently be doing it differently than him. It seems that they can't even determine what he is wanting them to do. I've gotten a lot out of this tape, but I am ready to move on to someone who adequately explains each movement. I'd like to see Billy Blanks do another tape with much better explanations and far less useless chit chat."
3,"IF YOU DON'T LIKE REPEATING STEPS, DON'T TRY THIS .","Billy Blanks seems like a nice enough fellow. The work out is good if you like repeating the same steps over and over. After I caught on to the few moves, I started getting bored. So I'm no longer doing it. Now I'm waiting on the Advanced workout to go on sale. I don't want to pay that much money for something that keeps repeating the same steps. I could do the basic video without watching it by the time I quit doing it. So for now I'm back to my treadmill."
1,Don't get fooled by Billy Blanks,"Billy Blanks is a joke. He never was a world kickboxing champion, he may have been in tournaments but he never was a champion. His workout may make you lose weight and make you feel great, but the thing is that he is trying to think of a new way of fighting that people would be stupid enough to go to his classes or buy his stupid video. Billy Blanks is a joke don't get fooled by his video. Working out urself at home is better than his video, all your going to do is waste your money and make Billy happy."
2,I don't like this movie,"Me parece una película con muy bajo contenido, pésima producción y ni que decir de los actores, directores no la recomiendo"
5,Bag with a Beat,I had the wonderful priviledge of seeing The Rogues perform live at the Bristol Renaissance Faire in Wisconsin. Their music is so full of life and is so uplifting it touches you. The live performances are amazing. As soon as they did the first 5 seconds of their song on stage I immediately ran to the table and bought two cd's along with my friend. Their personallties come right thorugh their music. The beat is so intoxicating it makes you want to get right up and dance....((I have..though not with much skill)). I urge you to buy this. And if by any chance you are able to run into them anywhere and can see a performance..do!!!
5,"If you're not Scotts-Irish Before You Hear This, You Will Be Afterwards!","Off Kilter is one of a long line of terrific renditions of traditional and original Scotts-Irish music offered up by one of the very best Celtic Groups in the country. The Rogues will get your blood pumping or your eyes tearing (often at the same time). Get this CD, get Made in Texas, and definitely get their new one, Rogue Trip, and you'll burn up your CD Player in a month. They recently did a gig in D.C. as guest performers with the United States Air Force Band and the whole place rocked. These Guys are Good!"
2,shallow tale in a forest,The Robber Bridegroom is Eudora Welty's first novel and it is not very good.The book has some of her typical dryhumor and sparkling prose but the story is thoroughly uncompelling and there is a lot of dead space in what seems meant to be an adventure story.She is much better at relationships and social structure. Skip this book
1,lame,"i have a deep appreciation for fine literature and unfortunately this just isn't it. the themes were obvious and irritating. i found it superficial and thoroughly uninteresting. None of the characters were fully developed and although extremely short, i found it difficult to complete it."
1,"Well, that was certainly different...","I did not enjoy or understand this strange tale. Perhaps a reader's guide should accompany it. I do, however, treasure The Collected Stories Of Eudora Welty."
2,Fascinating director meets dull interviewer,"Andre DeToth is a fascinating character and one of the most underrated directors of golden age Hollywood. In this q&a book, the great DeToth is ill served by the banal questions and one dimensional approach of the interviewer. DeToth himself seems vaguely contemptuous of the questioner's dull inquisition, and refers to him with a sarcastic ""Herr Future Director."" DeToth (by evidence of other interviews and his own book of memoirs) is a hilarious, larger-than-life figure, and some of this comes through, but the interviewer's complete lack of a sense of humor more often deadens the proceedings."
3,stephen King Creepy,Watched the whole series . I had never heard of it. Think its filmed in Nova Scotia (it has the same lighthouse as Haven). Really liked wondering who was next. Can say that it was better in the early episodes. The last few episodeswere just over the top.
3,Too Expensive!,"I was waiting for DVD to watch this show but apparently I will be Netflixing it. As of June 20th, for a September 8th release, they want 38 dollars and change foe this set. I WILL NOT pay that much money for something only 13 episodes long.Rental here we come"
4,Haper's Island review,"I originally caught the show when it aired on CBS around episode 6 or 7 and have to say I was disappointed that CBS didn't do more to promote this show. It was well written and decently acted and way more interesting than anything else on the network. I'm all done with crime-dramas and hospital shows. This was a refreshing change from the norm. Sadly it was on on a Saturday night which probably means death in TV land. It was fun, gruesome in some parts and entertaining. Would have liked more extras on the DVD but whatever."
5,Reading in bed has so improved,"This is a replacement for me as I have had a bed wedge for years. This one is so much better, well made and easy to keep clean too."
4,a touching collection of songs about immortality (or not),"This is a very interesting collection of gospel numbers, pop and country done in Jimmy's incredibly soulful, whispy slow style. The album is worth the price alone to hear him perform David Byrne's Heaven."
5,Death metal?,"""Individual Thought Patterns"" may be loosely classifiable as death metal, but such a genre-bending masterpiece as this one goes far beyond the confines of one genre. Here death combine elements of death, thrash, and progressive metal to create a very heavy album that also boasts a potent groove. ""Individual Thought Patterns"" is a magnificent balancing act that blends heaviness, technical precision, and top-notch songcraft. The late Chuck Schuldiner's vocals blend screaming and singing for a fairly unique style. The guitar riffs aren't really all that heavy, but they're fast, precise and cruncy, backed up by lightning-fast drumming and flowing bass lines. This album is perfect for death metal neophytes like myself, and recommended for fans of death-thrash hybrids like Sepultura and Slayer, or even pure thrash bands like Metallica or Megadeth."
5,This is the most incredible book ever written on the subject,I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to see through the distortion of the media. I defy anyone to read this book and believe afterward that 1) Gun Control works and 2) that it's the right thing to do.
4,Winnipeg Riots!,"A Stellar recording of now defunct AND existing bands. To me a Winnipeg Punk Rock night is a very, fun thing and this CD captures it. When I'm not seeing these bands play, I like to listen to them and through the recording known as ""Winnipeg Riot"" I am able to do so. What can you possibly loose? YOUR SANITY!"
2,Donut Cutter,"This cutter is junk. The metal is so flimsy that it is hard to insert the middle circle. The picture online also makes it look bigger than it actually is. It will probably make donuts, but it is not worth the 8 dollars that I paid for it (once you add in SH)"
4,Excellent read worthwhile buy!,I love mountaineering and this book was informative detailed and extemely enjoyable to read. Anyone interested about Everest should read it. I particularly liked the part about Goerge Mallory and Irvine.
1,not exactly accurate...,"It was pretty appalling to read that in '78 Everest was climbed by:'Polish houswife called Wanda Rutkiewitz'She was neither a housewife nor her name was Rutkiewitz. In fact her name was Rutkiewicz, she held electronics engineering degree and was one of the most accomplished female climbers in the world (first female ascent of K2 among others).Hope the rest of the book is more accurate."
5,A delectable novel,"Joanne Harris's first novel is a gem, small, but sparkling nonetheless. Her cast of chracters, mainly Vianne Rocher, are so startlingly human, you feel like you're one of their neighbors in the tiny French village of Lansquenet. I'm surprised that this didn't make Oprah's Picks. It's heartwarming, charming, humorous, and magical. The simple theme of good vs evil, which Harris depicts as the church vs chocolate, has never been this much fun. This is the perfect book for one of those chilly days when you're curled up near the fireplace with your mug of tea. It will definitely leave you with a smile on your face."
3,Gave me a hypoglycemia attack!,"This little book is full of wonderful ideas for treats and snacks, but skip it if you do not appreciate out-of-date-church bashing."
2,A failure in it's attempts to evoke a magical realism.,"Joanne Harris has tried to inject her work with magic, passion, sensuality... and has failed. Her characetrs are paper thin and poorly developed, the direction of her story obvious, and her descriptions of people, place, and the passion of the book CHOCOLATE are more often than not weak and ineffective. A real disappointment, Harris should leave the weaving of magical and sensual tales to the real masters of the art such as Allende."
4,What I Wanted,"I have been trying to get a copy of the books my favorite movies were based on, with the new covers. This one has been used before (clearly, as the book is about 10 years old), but in good condition. Normal wear and tear, and now part of my collection (but still readable)."
3,"Easy to read, relaxing but a little bit poor.","I read this book very fast but not because I couldn't wait to see what happened next, but because it is easy to read. It made eat chocolate more than I usually do."
4,Delicious!,"I bought this book after coming back from the South of France hoping it would bring back memories and would seem more realistic after being in the same sort of area.It did more than that, it was a really good book and one that brings images of a quaint shop set in a picturesque sunny village with delectable tempting chocolates in the window. Its best read whilst drinking hot chocolate preferably with a chocolate bar to dunk in it! I definitely recommend this book even if you just want to read the descriptions of chocolate!"
2,Plodded along,"For me, the movie told a better story; some pieces in the book were not resolved. I wouldn't recommend the book, but I'm glad I read the original source for the movie I enjoy so much. Maybe it was the dramatic discrepancies between movie and book that disappointed me."
3,"Cute, way better than the movie.","This book is definitely girly but not silly. Very typical plot, newcomer threatens the structure of the predictable society but the thoughts/letters of the priest are fascinating and the book is rather touching and not syrupy-sweet. A nice weekender."
3,A disappointment,"This book was recommended by a friend whose literary tastes I respect. However, I was disappointed. The story is simplistic, with the plot development easy to predict. Harris's evil priest is a one-dimensional character as are most of the others. Good for an ""airplane read"" but nothing more."
2,mouth-watering but disappointing,"At first I thought I had found a jewel of a novel. The reading seemed pure pleasure. Gradually, however, I began to see how shallow the idea behind the book is. The goodness of the positive characters makes you sick after a while just as too much chocolate does. The poor fiend of a priest for a change makes you feel sorry. If you are looking for heavy, naive symbolism and a black-and-white world here's a book for you."
1,Not the movie,Usually I like a book more than the movie. Oh well. The movie was so uplifting and fun. The book was so depressing.
3,Nicely written but disappointing,Generally good reviews brought me to this book but nothing important happens. Her characters are either good or bad and the good are rewarded while the bad get their just desserts. Her descriptions of the way in which she serves chocolate became a little too much and as for the rest of the book - it was not enough.
3,"hmmm, this is great 80s jazz/rock/stuff, but...","not the most exciting guitar record, as anticipated. i grew up on the flashy electric guitars of the 80s virtuoso's and really dig a well thought out guitar based tune. this record just didn't tickle me like i thowt it would. the back up band is super tight as would be expected of scofield, but the bass is a little too slap-happy for my current tastes. the production/mixing is well done (you can hear everything), but sometimes you want to hear the gee-tar, and the busy-ness of the band is very distracting.i definitely recommend checking out scofield's ""A Go Go"" record with Medeski, Martin and Wood as backup band. a much more interesting album with great licks, melodies, and of course smooth grooves."
3,Kennedy Asassination,Not one of the best efforts on compiling available facts from that dreadful day but worthy of your read. Worth the price just to have the sounds of that time.
2,Amazon shipped it with a dead battery,"The watch is attractive and seems like a good deal. Unfortunately, Amazon shipped it with a dead battery. Be warned - you may have to go and buy a new battery for it!"
5,great little watch,"I like this watch. The face is easy to read, has a sweep second hand, it has classic styling (and it is all black & white - no gold or silver or other metallic color), and it was inexpensive. I have smallish wrists, so sometimes I have trouble buying watches because the bands are so large and often end up being loose or the band has to wrap around pretty far. But this fits me perfectly. So if you are looking for a basic watch and you have small wrists, this might just be what you need."
1,The Cure for Insomnia,"This book is the cure for insomnia. If you have sleep issues, buy this book. Personally, I'd rather read the ingredients on the back of a soup can."
5,Wonderful way to learn a little history,"I agree with the other 5 star reviews. Personally, I learned a lot about the history of the British Occupation of Egypt, somehow omitted or forgotten from the many years ago I attended high school. I really enjoyed reading Leila's perspective and her writing style captured me. For me there was a nice weaving of history and personal experience which made the book come alive. This book is definately among the best I have read."
3,"Some re-recordings, but a lot of lefty","A 'Tee-Vee'recordings offering, this album includes a number of key early 60's 'countrypolitan' re-recordings of Frizell's early recordings, with a sprinkling of un-remastered originals as well. The re-recordings are a mix, with an obscene 'Always Late', preceded by an almost better than the original 'I Want to be With You Always'. A mixed bag, I'd recommend going for the higher priced re-mastered original recordings."
4,Eloquent,"This is a well-written autobiography of an autistic person who at times seems doomed to failure, then becomes remarkably successful.It is much more readable than similar books by Temple Grandin, and more careful about the extent to which her personality is representative of autistics in general.It is occasionally frustrating that some of her successes seem to involve a good deal of luck, and I'm left wondering whether they were due largely to chance or whether she left out something."
4,"Powhatan-English vocabulary list is small, but high quality.","A Vocabulary of Powhatan (American Language Reprints, Vol. 4) is a small but very high quality book. At first, I felt the price was a bit steep for such a small book, however, it is a hardback and Powhatan language resources are very hard to come by. The two points that make this book special are 1) the editors didn't just copy entries from the original word lists, they cleaned them up, making the book easy to read , and 2) the inclusion of Pamunkey and Nansemond word lists. Many thanks to American Language Reprints."
4,Best in the series,"There are plenty of surprises in this exciting story and the author has pulled everything together for a book that has pace, interesting characters, and a good ending. Although the writing could be better, Ms. Ames has improved heaps since her last two books and personally, I'd rather read a book like this than a perfectly written one that is boring. The Value of Valor kept me reading and made me finish with a big smile. I can't give it five stars because I only do that with the very best books I read. But you will like this one if you are just looking for some good entertainment."
3,As represented,"Hard to rate given I have not used it, which I hope to avoid. Photo and description are accurate in my opinion. Seems like it's a well built product."
4,Must have for the home,"I can't review it based on use since I've never had a fire in my house, but it is a handy item to have just in case. The only thing keeping me from posting this with 5 stars is that mine was charged just slightly into the green ""charged"" zone. If I ever end up having to use this I will update this review."
5,Great Item To Have,"This Fire Extinguisher is the perfect size to keep under the sink ""just in case"". It shipped in one day."
4,It came super Quick,Everything looks fine. Came in 2 days. Hopefully never have to use it. The instructions are on the side which are nice if you ever had an emergency.
3,"For few extra dollars, I would have preferred metal","There's a bit of a gap in what you can get for a non-toxic kitchen-type fire extinguisher. This one... you just never know about plastic. The next step up is a $200+ type K that is really meant for commercial use. Make me a $35 fire extinguisher just like this one, but with metal parts and refillable. I'd buy it. I'm going to end up buying 2 or 3 of these things just to make sure one works when I really need it."
3,Hard to read between the lines,"LOTS of good tunes; however, the print is too small and the tab noteheads are between the staff lines rather than on them, as more commonly found, making for difficult sightreading. It's still a very good resource for Oldtime/Bluegrass pieces for the banjo."
5,Cross curricular integration,"This story is a wonderful way to move into working with clay. Just as the boy in the story creates his own horse from clay, allowing children to work with clay immediately after hearing this story gives them a chance to experience kinesthetically what they've heard. Rather than going immediately to reflective or responsive writing, use this step to allow the children to spend more time working it through. Then write."
2,Nice Idea -try again,I wish I'd read the customer reviews BEFORE I bought this book. I gave it as a gift to some dog lovers and they report back that only about 50% of hotels/motels listed actually accept dogs. Often BIG dogs are not as welcome as smaller ones! This book is not as useful as one would hope...
5,best of the trilogy,"The questions and characters revealed in the first two books of this trilogy further explored in this third entry. A good deal of the book is about fighting and finding allies. Like much of ""Vampire: the Masquerade"" it is also about using others to get ahead and the effects of doing that on the mind, the emotions and the soul. This time both the effects on Kindred and ghouls are explored. I have a fondness for ghouls and have several players playing these servants in my annual summer tabletop game. Dedopulos does a good job of looking at the newness and horror of newbie Kindred and ghouls both though I wish someone would write more about ghouls in general. I was very pleased to finish this third book. Maybe I'll have good on Theo show up this summer when our rpg group restarts up Vampire."
1,cookbook,Recipes were pretty heavy on the carbs and not practical. I would not buy it again. Sorry. Also not enough pictures of the food.
4,goodhousekeeping diabetic cookbook,There should be more simple recipes. Some recipes are not compatible with everyday cooking instead are of gourmet fare.
5,The BEST!,"My niece in England got this for me the day before my daughter's wedding. It was a miracle...gone the cramping pain and the awful urgency! No, I don't think it cured anything except the symptoms! The underlining problem cured itself fortunately, meanwhile I was pain and symptom free, without the constipation etc that Imodium etc causes. A Godsend! I have kept it and shared with many over the last few years and have never heard anything but rave compliments for it! Wish I had shares! Only have this problem rarely...but would not be without this at home. When needed it is wonderful!"
4,"more an informational resource, than manual","Stride's book ( 'Miniature Internal Combustion Engines' by Malcolm Stride ) explains how the small IC motors work, whereas this book serves to illustrate the various types and examples of model IC motors made - and is an excellent source of inspiration. Many of the examples in this have further documentation on MEN (model engine News) - in short I consider this book a partner to Stride's book - together they show what can be done, and many examples of how and why."
3,Just ok,"A nice thermometer, actual glass face that should not yellow over time. BUT, has no adjustment, and mine is running about 3 degrees high compared to my calibrated weather station."
1,temp is not accurate,"i have this thermometer in my garage, next to my water softener. i put the thermometer in there so that i could ensure that the temp was above freezing at all times to prevent pipes bursting. mine reads high. it seems permanently stuck around 70 regardless of the season (my garage is not heated), which i think is funny because that is what it reads in the main picture for this product. i wonder if they just glued the hand on the face at 70 degrees. i can't recommend this to anyone, and suggest you look at a different item to meet your needs."
4,A Decent Book,"I enjoyed reading Teranesia. Even though I enjoyed Distress and Diaspora more, it was only because I enjoyed Teranesia that I was led to read them. Egan's knowledge of science, computers and mathematics are well shown in all of his works. I have found few authors who can capture my scientific side as well as he. Most science fiction only brushes on the fields of science and math, usually leaving them as mysterious knowledge beyond the grasp of the readers. It was also a pleasure coming across a book filed outside of the gay/lesbian literature section of the bookstore with a gay main character. I feel that even though this work was not built completely in the walls of the imagination like some of his other books, it satisfied my appetite as a reader of science fiction."
4,I agree the ending isn't that good but...,"Teranesia was a good book, but I have to agree with the other reviewers the ending was rushed and quite unresolved. I liked the fact that Egan developed the characters more than he usually does. Contrary to the review by Judson, the science is accurate but, like Egan's other books, you need to be very well versed in the subject to follow the concepts fully.So I only give it four stars because of the ending. Other than that I say enjoy."
2,A ruined production,"I've listened to their other CD's, and saw them in concert, but I think this record is an example of not knowing what to do next. They brought in drums and electric instruments and now play this hybrid blend of jump country wash that sounds rushed and misdirected. Some of the lyrics are still nice, but against the new instrumentation, they seem unconvincing."
4,Lively & Melodious,"A toe-tapping, happy compliation that I accidentally stumbled upon ...one which my friends have liked when I played it for them. A nice CD to introduce one toMiddle Eastern (albeit ?Algerian /Moroccan... Rai style of ) popular music ... even though much of it is in French...including a sort of a rap song...Parisien du Nord"
5,He'll Come Through For You,This album is an excellent demonstration of uplifting gospel music. It has been a tremendous blessing in my life.
3,good story,"Kerry Greenwood created a fun to read cozy with interesting characters. I don't know that I ""fell in love"" with any of them. I'll probably read another of her books."
4,Absolutely delightful!,"Phryne, pronounced Fry-knee to rhyme with briny, is a wonderful character. She's independent, smart, talented, stylish, and knows both poverty and wealth. This is someone you'd love to know. The story is both light and humorous but deals with serious subjects. The writing is intelligent, clever and in keeping with the period. There are now 15 books in the series and you can believe I'm going to try to find them all."
4,The first of the Phryne Fisher mysteries in 1920's Australia,Phryne Fisher sails to Australia in the late 1920's. She finds herself surrounded on all sides by villains during her search for the King of Snow. This book brings alive the magic of 1920's Melbourne and the era of fun and flappers.
2,Kindle Edition Review only,"5 stars for the novel, awesome, I've read it several times.2 stars for Kindle edition.I'm halfway through, and this is what I've found:Sometimes new paragraph is started in mid sentence, where clearly it is not a new paragraph.Spacing/word errors (e.g. one instance: instead of ""light's"" it is ""ligh t's"") Attanasio runs words together as part of his style in this book, I'm not referring to this.Some scanning errors (""y"" to ""v"") in some instances.Drift's cultural group is referred to as the ""ne"" with French accent character. The publisher did a clumsy search and replace to add the accent so words like ""neck"", ""never"", and ""necessary"" have french accent over the ""e"". Also when they did this for some reason it runs together with the previous word. So ""his neck"" becomes ""hisneck""Despite all this, the Kindle dictionary is a cool factor here. It's nice to be able to instantly look up words as Mr. Attanasio uses lots of obscure words in this novel."
2,"So many ""comfort"" foods missing!!","I hate to give this book only 2 stars because there are some great recipes. I have to give the low rating becasue it's not really a ""comfort"" cook book. I was born and raised in the south and was disappointed that these classic ""comfort"" recipes were not in the book: fried chicken, fried okra, fried green tomaotes. There are no corn bread or grits recipes. I have to disagree with the person who said the chicken pot pie crust was not in the book. it is on page 279. This mix is for several recipes. I made it for the hamburger pie - which is great. My son loved it! I have not made a lot of recipes in this book ,but glad I have it and plan to try more. I think a better title would have been ""quick and easy"". Most of the recipes don't have a lot of ingredients, but you do have to make your own flour mixes. This is standard with any gluten free cook book."
5,G F Diet,This book is a very good resource for anyone who has to follow a gluten free diet. The author has included flour mixes that you can make for your own use. I would highly recommend the book.
3,Not what I thought it would be,"This book certainly contains gluten free recipes, but many of the recipes are gluten-free recipes to being with, such as ""Crockpot Chili"", ""Fruited Dressing for Pork"", ""Deviled Eggs"", and ""Chicken Waldorf Salad"".I already have hoards of recipes that don't call for gluten-containing ingredients. This book is a collection of recipes you can make complete meals from, whether they contain gluten ingredients or not. I expected that it would be a 100% compilation of gluten containing foods you could cook using gluten-free substitutes.The good points I gave to this book are that it gives you directions for making several types of gluten-free baking mixes to use in the recipes that normally call for flour. And those recipes don't contain any of that awful tasting soy flour."
5,The most underrated collection since Borges.,"Gene Wolfe is a thinker. His intricate fiction demonstrates a mind that is crammed with ideas which hurl themselves into the souls of his characters and the ideals of his stories with forceful abandon. So insightful and varied that it usually defies the overapplied label of science fiction, Wolfe's work is not for the shallow reader; for those who desire food for thought, on the other hand, this is the richest of feasts. Yet in spite of his subtly interwoven social commentary and his consinstently profound innovations, Wolfe's most valuable trait is his skill as a pure storyteller. The quality of the material in these stories and the adeptness with which their themes are transferred to prose is enough to entice even the most bored bookworm"
2,Caused some side effects,Never really got the chance to see if this is effective because it caused me to have nausea. I don't know if it was a bad batch or something else. Anyway the refund went well.
2,Confusion included,"Appleton & Lange's Outline for the Physician Assistant Examination is seriously deficient in content regarding the NCCPA Examination Content Blueprint, there are many subjects from the blueprint that are not covered in this review. It also does not cover up to date treatment practice guidlines. It is also seriously riddled with incorrect information when compared to many medical textbooks such as Current's Medical Diagnosis & Treatment and Harrison's. The combination of these deficiencies will erroneously lead the aspiring PA into confusion and error on the exam. Even using the USMLE books will not be enough of a guide so I suggest that all subjects in the blueprint be reviewed individually with other sources and corrections made by the student into this book before attempting the exam.Hopefully a new book edition that is edited more thoroughly using more accurate sources will become available soon since this one is already three years out of date."
3,Poorly made mp3 album,"The music is great, but every song suddenly cuts off at the end in the mp3 version of the album."
4,Edie from Pennsylvania,"I enjoy reading true crime stories and Ann Rule is always a winner. For this book, though, I tend to agree with A Reader From Buffalo about his description of Dr. Pignatoro's wife. When I read that she participated (albeit in a benign way) in the ""basement"" surgeries, I realized she was not as innocent as Ann Rule depicted. How could anyone with any intelligence ignore the negligence and atrocities committed in that room? Perhaps it made for better reading by making Mrs. Pignatoro appear so innocent."
3,A bit snug,Nice looking gloves but they are a bit snug to be an Extra-Large. Just know that they run small so order a bigger size.
1,BUYER BE AWARE!!!,I returned the bowl because bottom did not fit to my Oster Kitchen Center; the advertisement does not let you see the bottom section - unlike the other bowls - there was the separate addition to the bottom that did not fit to the groove.The cost showed by the ad is $28.99 but Small Appliances only reimburse $23.33 and I finally was told after a couple of requests for explanation and the difference of $6.66 not reimbursed was their original shipping cost. This however was not shown on the ad! Additionally I was requested to mail the bowl back certain way that cost me $7.72. So this transaction cost me the total of $14.38 and I ended up nothing!!!
4,Searching for more of Marilyn you haven't yet seen?,"I have a huge collection of Marilyn books and came across this one of an intimate photographic session Douglas Kirkland did with Marilyn for Look magazine's 25th anniversary edition in 1961. Very much worth the purchase for Marilyn fans - the photos are stunning, Marilyn is stunning! The text is sparse with the occasional typo...but you aren't there for the photographer's text, are you? Marilyn is as lovely as ever, and I would love to see this book in a larger format one day as the rather small format does not do the beautiful images justice. Great behind-the-scenes photos as well. Definitely a book I will be adding to my collection and looking through in years to come."
2,"Disappointing CD, given the hyperbolic reviews on Amazon.com","I purchased this CD in good faith, because of the extremely positive reviews on Amazon.com. However, the CD, despite excellent recording quality, contains rather mediocre songwriting, colorless singing, and derivative arrangements."
2,Mercy River Desending,"When I first bought this CD,I listened to it in it's entirety three x's in a row.The first two songs are good but the record seems to stall after that.It just never kicks in.Mercy River is at ""ebb tide"" on this one."
3,"Keeps clothes clean, but...",The part you velcro in the back likes to curl up after only a few uses. Eventually the bib become like a map that must be unrolled for use and it sits all funny on the kid. We have to tuck it into the belt on her highchair to keep it laying flat instead of rolling up. They must be replaced after 3-6 months depending on how often they're used. Cute though.
2,Yamaha NS-6490 3-way speakers,I anticipated better performance from these three way bookshelf speakers made by Yamaha. My Carver Sunfire center channel speaker over powers these speakers with ease. The response is quit slow and lacks the crisp highs and bottom end bass that I was seeking when I purchased these speakers.
5,a great collector edition,as a mason for 24yrs its agreat collection to my collection.every mason should have one!the info is great and its tell you about the history of masons and eastern stars
4,A good summary of topics,"Before taking the actual AP Psychology test I prepared using this book. It mentioned all the concepts that were on the test, but remember that it is just a review book. Thus, it did not go into depth on many important concepts. So, if you don't fully understand something mentioned in the book, open your textbook to clarify that topic. Furthermore, I thought the practice tests were very similar to the real exam, so be sure to take those! Overall, I think perusing the book is an excellent way to prepare for the big test!"
1,same problem with the wind,"we also have the 12' version and ours too blew through the yard twice in a week completely destroying it. both of our neighbors' trampolines are still intact and didn't budge. we also had the blue cover that goes over the springs completely rip in the first few months and the zipper that closes the ""door"" only lasted the first few weeks. JUNK!!"
5,Something...unbelievable,"I remember when Silk Road series came out from the TV. I didn't know anything about Kitaro, but I was immediately obsessed with the music. This was the first album I bought and I think that it's one of the best I've ever heard. Especially the first melody is still my favourite. Thank you Kitaro for making such music!"
1,I suggest a pass,"SharePoint as a technology is a tremendous product. This book, however, does not come close to doing it justice. I found the verbiage to be incoherent in various places, and occasionally terms were simply never defined. Further, at one point the author says ""At the time we had to go to press with this chapter, the information on how to use Microsoft SharePoint Server 2003 extranets was in the beta stages of being written""... When I purchased this book about SharePoint products and technologies, I assumed the author would be able to write about SharePoint portal server 2003 without requiring other authors to pave the way. In short, this book seems to be a repurposing of information from other sources in a pell-mell fashion. Consequently I cannot recommend it."
4,Excellent!,The book offers a simple but still comprehensive oversight of the field of strategic management. I can recommend it.
3,Does not on every device.,"This is a great concept but does not work if your TV, game console, or appliance consumes any electricity when not in use. The Power Cop does not work with my Sony Bravia TV or the PS3. Most electronics use electricity even when they are off. It does a great job doing what it is designed to do. That is letting current pass for a set amount of time within a 24 hour period."
3,skips too much,"I guess the previous reviewers didn't try any of the exercises in the book. They are very good problems but the text is far from sufficient for us to solve the problems. For example, there is only one example in chapter 2 on how to find integral basis and it is a quadratic field. However, the 4th problem of this chapter is to find the discriminant of a degree-4 extension! At least the author should supply more theorems on integral basis so that we know how to start such a problem.I feel like the author is very ""Rudin"" in his writing, neglecting all the details. Sometimes it's fun to fill in the details myself, but sometimes it can be rather annoying. I think a undergraduate textbook shouldn't skip too many steps in the proofs."
2,Director Deserves to be Shot,"I could not watch the entire video. In places the acting was poor but I'm pretty sure the director didn't understand what the script called for. Speaking of script, largely really silly dialog. Maybe the people involved in this sort of activity would be like most of us. Not to bright. Guess I was hoping for some lively conversation as well."
3,WHAT DOES CANADA KNOW ABOUT AMERICA?,"I had to write this review only because of the cracks made by the fellow from Ontario. I agree Knowles poetry is not happy feel good new age nonsense. But his vision of America is very real especially since last September. Unlike the other fellow, I read it with an open mind. Poetry is a art form. I guess their are always ignorant critics. As far as the poetry contruction. That book cost more to laminate and bind. Actually its nice because the cover won't stain. Didn't find mistakes either except for the guy north of the border......"
2,Not for our house - maybe yours.,"It's big and it collects dust in more ways than one. I bought it thinking it would save time cleaning the house but it doesn't. It doesn't bend so it doesn't clean corners, odd shapes, go around objects well. If your house has clean straight lines with minimalism decor, this is the duster for you. I can take a old hand towel and it will clean better and clean faster than this thing. So yes, it does collects dust.... in the basement closet."
4,You never forget your first,"That's sort of the theme of this story- the characters live the rest of their lives worshipping their first Passion forever. It is beautiful and the descriptions of Venice will make you want to book a flight there immediately.Incidentally, something most reviewers seem to have missed here is that Henri's story and Vilanelle's story are both taken from the real life of French author Stendhal (aka Henri Marie Beyle, the 19th century author of The Red and The Black), who really was a cook for Napoleon and really did have unrequited love for a noble lady, Mathilde Viscontini Dembowski. Read Stendhal's ""Love"" for more on that particular episode."
3,Initial Zing but fades quickly,This book started with much promise as Henri embarks on his adventures as a young soldier in Napoleon's army but when Winterson changes narrators to Villanelle my interest started to wane and I steadily found the narrative less and less compelling. The plot too seemed to become less convincing and I got no great feeling of atmosphere when Henri and Villanelle journeyed back from Moscow. This book came with lots of great reviews but I felt let down as it lacked warmth and I never found the writing evoked any real emotional response from me. Especially irritating was the story surrounding Villanelle's heart and her affair with the married Venetian woman: it lacked any real depth and sadly passion which is strange given the title of the book.
3,Cruel and Unusual...,"... that's not to say it's not a good read, just not what I expected.Set against the background of the Napoleonic wars, this book blends historical references with the surreal. The characters and the writing style made it a worthwhile read, but overall was a bit too disconnected from its cruelty for my liking.For truly excellent `cruel and unusual' writing, I would recommend Patrick Suskind's `Perfume' instead."
3,okay,"After reading the reviews I was a little sceptical about these. They felt weird because the heel is deep, but has a good cushion...I am used to heels. The stitching across the front kind of presses my bunion, if you have that problem. The leather is good and the tab in back was secure. I am going to wear them on a trip and throught the airport, so an update may come to their comfortability.update: I wore these on a long airport trudge (Ohara chicago) and they passed the test!!!"
4,An excellent treatise on applied combinatorics.,"This book is an excellent resource for mathematicians, computer scientists, and engineers. The book shows how to use zero-one matrices and stochastic matrices in your work. The text pretty shows a lot of interesting properties different matrices have and how to compute various values associated with graphs from them. The book would be very useful for people interested in Neural Networks, Speech Recognition, Artificial Intelligence. It is mathematics, though and it describes the properties of the matrices and contains many proofs about these properties. Make sure that you have mastered linear algebra and combinatorics before reading this text."
1,junk,I bought a pair of these and what I didn't notice when purchasing was the little plastic bumper inbetween the spring and the blades. On my coronas the stopper is metal.. I ruined these pruners in literally 3 hours. They also became loose.. what a joke.. I bought them because I thought the shape was neat but the bumper is such a complete failure. waste of money.
5,solid construction,My old pruners broke because they had a plastic handle. These pruners would be very hard to break. Solid steel construction with rubberized coating on handles.
3,okay,"they were just ""okay."" i probably will not buy the same again. i guess the blades are not sharp enough"
4,Gorgeous,"These are gorgeous - clean and contemporary. I only gave them 4 stars because there is a small scratch on the surface of one of my shakers and the top is a little difficult to screw tight on the same shaker so the quality control isn't top notch. However, I love them."
2,There's no plot!,"I'm a big fan of Peter S. Beagle and I certainly don't deny that he can write wonderfully and create an appealing fantasy world. However, the main ingredient of story is conflict, and there is essentially none in the Unicorn Sonata. Sure, Indigo gets a bit sulky, but the major part of the book comprises Joey going to the unicorn world, having fun, and - that's all. If you are new to Beagle, start with ""The Last Unicorn,"" or ""The Innkeeper's Song,"" both of which are great books, with actual plots."
1,Wow!,"I found myself wondering if these were the words of a jaded lover. The sarcasm is very unprofessional. The author seems to really hate Dr. Atkins. There are more ""non references"" in this book than any I have read that is supposed to be factual. Sentences like ""Authorities recommend..."" and ""...essentially every single study of these diets..."" never stating a study or the authorities. Terrible book - if you are looking for facts look elsewhere. If there was a rating less than one star I would have opted for that rating."
1,dismal purchase,this so-called 'rugged' green laser fell apart within one day. no care or precision went into making this product. i've owned several green lasers and this 'ruggedized' p.o.s. is not worth your time or money.
2,A gift,"I bought this for someone who travels. These fit great in a suitcase and weighted little. When you get to your destination, you fill them with water and use them as weights."
2,Unwarranted bashings,"A hyperkinetic though uninspired mess of third-rate indie d&b electronica will go only as far as to appease hardcore fans of the hardcore subgenre it caters to, almost always substituting overly-obnoxious samples and blunted beat-making for any kind of rhythmic or melodic cohesion."
3,pricey but great,"A little pricey but an excellent product that we have had to ""smuggle"" in from France for our favorite salad dressing recipes."
1,Didn't last,"This product didn't even last four days with my dog. After ordering I was really excited and told a friend that i was getting it, only to find out her dog destroyed it in two days.....not very durable"
3,Nobbly Wobbly Dog Toy,"This gift was purchased for our toy poodle for Christmas. When it wasunwrapped he kind of put his head on the side, like ""What is it?"". Hehasn't been that attracted to it, having only played with it a coupleof times."
3,"OK, but there are better movies in the genre","I never had gotten around to seeing this previously. In the end, I don't think I missed much. Pacino reprises his gangster role from Scarface and the Godfather movies; maybe not quite as over-the-top as Scarface, but a similar enough kind of story. Sean Penn plays his sleezebag friend, and I guess he did a good job, because I hated the guy!"
3,Do The Right Thing,"This engaging and underrated drama from Brian De Palma tells the somewhat familiar but interesting story of Carlito (Al Pacino), an ex-con who tries to give his life a meaning and therefore avoids some earlier behaviours and habits. However, obstacles came across as his old ""friends"" get on his way creating a couple of difficult, tension-filled situations. Despite the predictability of the plot in some moments, this is still a very solid movie with a bunch of intriguing and moving scenes. Also, Sean Penn plays an unusual character worth taking a look at."
4,Escape to Paradise,"Carlito, played by Al Pacino, has just been released after five years in jail for drug dealing. His shady lawyer friend, Adam-well played by Sean Penn, gets Carlito released early on a technicality. Carlito struggles to change his life, but his old world keeps pulling him back in. His dream is to earn $75,000, move to Paradise (Bermuda), and buy into a car rental company. He comes oh, so close.Carlito rediscovers his great love, Gail, and they pick up where they left off before he was incarcerated. They try to make a break for Bermuda, but Carlito's life catches up with him.This is not a typical gangster movie-Carlito has reformed. Al Pacino brings humanity to the gangster. The movie moves at a steady pace. I especially enjoyed the opening and the closing. It is a good choice."
3,great,"never saw this movie before was a good one. love Al Pacino in mostly all he has made, also Sean Penn was a surprise in this movie"
3,2 stars goes to Penelope + 1 to the rest of the cast,"When I first watched this movie I really doubted that Penelope Ann Miller was cut out for the ""stripper"" role. But her acting (and her nice body, too) turned out quite fascinating. Actually Al Pacino, Sean Penn, John Leguizamo (""Benny Blanco from the Bronx""), Luis Guzman, James Rebhorn... all gave good performances as well. However, with such a strong cast -- plus the exceptional talent of Brian de Palma, this film never got out of the shadow of ""Scarface"" to make a surprise on its own. Probably because the plot was full of cliches. To me, the only scene that's worth a playback was the Kleinfeld - Brigante confrontation in the hospital. It got me to understand what ""Carlito's way"" means."
1,one snooze of a movie,"uy,yuy,yuy. i don't know what my sisters saw in this movie when it came out. i finally saw this wack a** movie from beginning to end. it was beyond boring. it was just like that movie, ""Scarface"", but worse. the whole time i was watching it, i was rolling my eyes waiting for something good to happen. the only good part about the film was THE END, when carlito was ready to get killed by the mob guys and when John Leguizamo popped back into the picture and he shot him. im sorry, any movie with Al Pacino in it, is BOR-ing to me. no movie with that man in it has ever fascinated me. not Scarface, not the GodFather, not Serpico, not even the Devil's Advocate."
5,CLEANING BIBLE,"THIS BOOK IS A MUST IN EVERY HOUSEHOLD. LOVE MINE SO MUCH,IM BUYING MORE COPIES AS GIFTS. NO MORE OVER PRICED, MYSTERIOUSCHEMICALS IN MY HOUSE. BE SURE TO READ THE ENTIRE BOOK BECAUSEI FOUND SOME ADDITIONAL TIPS WERE NOT LISTED RESPECTIVELY IN THEINDEX."
1,Don't waste your money,Did not work upon arrival. I bought a new battery and the watch worked for about a week.
1,Worse Blades Ever Made,"I had a set of these crappy blades for 3 months. When they are new, they wipe things cleanly and quietly. After two or three weeks of moderate usage, the blades start skipping the windshield every time you use them. Worse of all, they produce the annoying squealing noise when they wipe the glass as if they demanded you dump them as soon as possible. Look for something else if you don't want to change your blades every two or three months. Michelin and Rain-X are many orders of magnitude better than Anco."
4,my first toshiba!!,"The picture is bright and sharp you can download HD movies and it looks great.I recommend upgrading the memory to a 4gb ram so you'll be set for years to come.the wireless-g-/bluetooth works fine it pick up my router in no time,but I'm having a difficult time figuring out how to hook up the live TV from media center using my satellite HD DVR from dish network other then the notebook works great and the remote control is awsome:)"
1,Not worth the time,"After reading this book in one day, my only reaction is: I want my time back. The story line and character development was stagnant. I do not recommend this book."
4,Street punk lives,A great album from the modern street punk kings . It's cleaner than the old stuff and isn't that a good thing in many ways. This is no nonsense punk rock . If like bands like the casualties and a global threat you'll be into this .
5,New characters in her series,"I love all of her books, some more than others. I love that she has woven different periods of US history into her books. I like that she focused on women that come to the quilting classes instead of the women that work at Elm Creek. It makes it more interesting to bring new characters into her series. All of the characters in her books flow from one book to the next. The reader not only gets a US history lesson and quilting lessons but lessons in the human heart and experience. She's a wonderful writer."
5,One of the greatest Medieval Folk albums ever done,"WOW what can i say about this album & this side project by the mastermind of Sigurd ""Satyr"" Wongraven of Satyricon, & special guest pianist Ihsahn of Emperor.This is an amazing beautiful album to listen to over & over it has that dark medieval folk sound to it that you will just love when you listen to this album.I definitely recommend buying this album as it is just one of a kind out there & i am very happy to own a copy of this great album.To bad this side project only lasted 1 album since 95, i just hope that Satyr will make another great album like this one soon.."
5,book review,The book was informative and helpful. It gave me some real insight into helping my patients. I have also recommended the book to some of my patients.
5,Great book!,This book was right on. I couldn't believe how it was my family to a T. Very well written and articulated.
2,toe cheese,"okay, i was exaggerating. the cd isn't as bad as toe cheese. but i don't think it's worth 10 bucks, either."
3,Fun,"Fun read, short. It only lasted one day so I wish it had been a bit longer. Fun character but the ending was a bit pat."
5,Matches perfectly.,"These mugs match my other plum fiestaware perfectly. The mugs look and feel sturdy. The mug is comfortable to hold and the handle is just right. I have washed mine in the dishwasher only three times but haven't noticed any imperfections as some of the other reviews state. If I do I will edit the review later. We use our mugs for giant cups of cocoa, tea, or coffee, but have even used them for chili,etc. I usually get fiesta items from a Saks affiliate but they didn't have these mugs in plum. So I ordered them from here and the quality was the same as the department store and the price was about the same as well. Overall, I am very pleased with these mugs and am happy to have found them :)"
4,perfect but just a bit too big,"brilliant nicely shaped monster mugs. look great, but we still keep reaching for the old regular-style non-fiestaware mugs cause the jumbo ones are often just too much (and we live in texas, where oversized is always better). definitely agree with previous reviewer who wishes there were an in-between size from fiestaware. those little mugs with the pretty but useless ring handles don't work, and the wonderful jumbo mug is overkill for normal use. i'd vote for keeping the design, just scaling it down a bit."
3,Good enough for the money,"I bought this for my 11 yr boy scout to take camping. Just the right product for the boy. However, it is apparently not tough enough for boys. On the first trip, 3 of the feet came off and a small hold tore in the side pocket. I was able to fix the feet with some wood buttons; however, I was disappointed in the durability of this product.When it wears out I will buy a higher quality product, now knowing that this type of product suites our needs for early boyscout camping."
3,not all bad,"Bag showed up, and it is a large bag, the item seems to grow as I add stuff to it. The biggest drawback is the feet, I HATE the feet! I am almost certain they will bee torn off during use, and after reading other reviews i thought I would do some minor surgery when the bag arrived... this proved to be a bad idea, the feet are not screwed on they have rivets in them... I will just have to wait till they are torn off. Over all, the bag seems to be heavy enough, it does have that oh so new smell, but seems to fade quickly. Material seems to be heavy enough to withstand the rigors of use, the overall design of the bag is good, could use internal dividers, and stitching seems a little loose.Overall is it a good bag?? I feel yes, it is.. only time will tell... but those darn feet!!I would recommend this bag to others, just on price alone, but Don't be shocked by the little feet on the bottom... they could be a deal breaker!"
3,It is a well made bag but has its flaws,"first, bag is well made. lots of room for stuff. now, I think the bag is too big, and i have no real practical use for it. if it is smaller then i can use it as a everyday bag and put stuff in them. but because of its size, you are not going to hike around with 50-70lbs of stuff in it, it is just not practical (you can claim you do, but that's just stupid). you really shouldn't use this as a travelers bag because i don't think it is as rugged as a suitcase, and it doesn't have wheels. you can't throw everything in there and expect stuff to stay in place--there are no dividers or compartments inside. terrible organizational bag."
2,Awkward top opening plus late delivery equals return,I'm retired military & the bag is engineered awkwardly. The top zipper which leads to the large storage compartment stops short on each end making it not open fully. Yeah you can store a lot but getting it in and out would be restrictive especially with all the straps. It reminded me a lot of my old Army duffel and flight bag. You can put a lot in it but try to find something easily or get it out not so much fun. Just not what I thought it would be and it arrived late anyway so I am returning it. I could also see what people meant about the bottom feet. They could easily snap off. I will say it does have quality material & zippers but its design wasn't as great as some of the reviews here. I bought a $20 bag that I could store just as much stuff locally that gave me complete access to the storage compartment to take on my trip.
5,Great Bag,"All i can say is wow. when i first looked at it, it looked pretty small. However, when you open it,it is huge. Very good quality fabric, andthe inside is made up of waterproof material. On the inside there is also about a foot long pocket for storing maps. It has a plastic seal over it, so to make it waterproof. On one end of the bag, under the utg sign, there is a id holder. There is pockets all around the outside. Amazing bag. Im glad I got 2. Buy them now while they are only 30 bucks you will not be sorry. Oh and the camo makes it even better. Will upload photos"
5,Blum 110 Degree Hinges,They screw right in and fit perfectly. They have worked perfectly for the last couple of months. No issues at all.
4,Great Service from Blum,"I have a similar hinge on all kitchen cabinents. I'll agree that the plastic part can break causing the door to not fully close. However, blum will replace these free of charge - FOREVER. Mine are 20 years old, and I've twice had to send a few back. Blum has replaced with new ones at no charge. The latest batch, UPS lost the parts in shipment and delivered and empty envelope (thanks UPS!). blum is resending another batch, no questions asked."
4,Condensed Information,"Very good instructional DVD for beginner and intermediate guitarist. The various aspects of guitar playing are broken down in sections packed with a lot of information in a very concise form.It would be very helpful if the DVD included an ""extras section"" with TABs of the examples performed by the author. The addition of TABs would lead to an excellent teaching product."
5,A great but general overview of American involvment in Vietnam,"This book is an entertaining read. It is short, fast paced, and gives a fantastic overview of how America became involved in the war.It begins by explaining the French occupation of Indochina, and ends far after the American war there ended.That being said, this book is VERY general, and goes into little detail about the HOWS and WHYS of the war. You can not read this book and know all there is to know. You need more than one source. This book should be combined with a video series called Vietnam: A Television History, and a couple of other books to get the full picture. For people seriously interested in the WHYS of American involvement, focus on the years JFK took office until about 1966, this will give you all of the reasons you need."
2,God's gift of love after death communications,"Way to many stories from same people, I had thought book would be different people writing of their experiences.which was not the case, there are different people's experience but ALOT from same people. Would have liked better if one story from that person.I guess if you want something to pass time this book is for you,"
2,only for those with very strong Christian beliefs,"With all due respect to the author's intended audience, I have to point out that the book seems to be meant for those whose religious beliefs are specifically strong, perhaps even fundamentalist, Christian. I'm posting this review only so others considering buying it can know that, whether it persuades them to buy it or not to buy it.When I read the reviews as I was considering it, I was very interested, but might not have bought it, had I known how deeply Christian its foundation is, since the person I was buying it for is quite spiritual but of a different faith."
1,Useless,You get what you pay for. After receiving this desolderingbulb and trying to use it I found it to be useless. The plasticspout seems to fail to make a good enough seal to actuallysuck molten solder into the bulb. therefore it is useless.
5,"Raphael, So Great","The Ghost in the Tokaido Inn is about a boy named Seikei, who wishes he could become a samurai.The story takes place during the Summer Bon Festival in Japan. At this time, Lord Hakuseki's jewel gets stolen, and Seikei sets off to find the thief. This is a great book because it has a lot of action, and many turning points. Another reason is that it makes you think about goals that you have set and achieved. It is very well written. This book is meant for a person who likes action, adventure, samurai, and mystery. Age 9 and up."
3,Average,Hard to follow and understand Although it has lots of usefull information Needs to have a chapter on Growth I use it for Anatomy and physiology of farm animals.
4,Great casual watch,"I read the earlier reviews and thought ""At last, a casual watch made for me!"" Between my tiny wrists and my tendency to destroy casual accessories, I had just about given up on watches. And for the price, how could I go wrong? Yes, the face is small; yes, the band is cheap plastic. I love it. I wouldn't wear it to the office or church, but for playtime, park-time, running around town on Saturdays, etc., it's perfect."
2,Wouldn't recommend this.,For the price its an OK watch. I wish the band was better....its kinda of cheap. I wouldn't give it as a gift but for me to wear to work its fine
3,Not as good as I expected,"I probably should have read more carefully, but I've bought so many inexpensive watches over the years that I didn't question it. The band feels like it was made out of car tire. I've been known to take a $5 watch bought off the street in NYC and add a leather band. Wore it forever. This one will be okay but again it is not that exciting."
3,Its not bad,"It is not bad for the price. I expected it would be better than this because its casio. But strap looks cheap, dial is better."
3,"Fine atmosphere, but little else","When Chloe (Garance Clavel) goes on vacation, her cat goes missing. This slight plot provides our window into the world of a modern young Parisian woman and the neighborhood she inhabits. This film gets high marks for atmosphere, but I wanted more than that. I did not find the heroine to be as charming as many other reviewers have. On the contrary, I thought she was rather self-involved and shallow. At one point, she can't even be troubled to have a five-minute phone conversation with one of the network of old ladies who is helping to search for her cat and who is clearly calling out of sheer loneliness. At the end of the film, I didn't feel like she had changed or learned anything, leaving me to wonder why I had been watching her for the past two hours. I was touched by the character of Djamel (Zinedine Soualem), the sad, slow-witted man who develops a crush on Chloe./"
4,A Quaint Yet Melancholy Film,"I first saw this film for free at a downtown theater earlier this week. I liked it so much, that I rented it last night. Aside from offering amazing views of Paris, this film is an engaging character study--not only of the city's denizens but of Chloe, who I think every single girl living in a big city can relate to. The woman who played Madame Renee was hilarious (I was glad to see older women such as her getting meaty roles). And the drummer was hot."
2,Grammar and editing disaster,"I'm a true crime fan and live in Louisiana so I was really looking forward to reading this book. By the second page I was wondering who in the world performed the editing. The spelling and grammar errors were so pervasive that, being the stickler for grammar that I am, I was unable to read past the second chapter. The author has a very interesting first-hand account of a horrible tragedy. It is ashame that the technicality of poor (or no) editing takes away from the story to such a degree that it is unreadable."
4,very nice gear bag,"I bought the gray version of this bag. It is very sturdy and has plenty of pockets to store the variety of gear I carry to the accademy. I use it 4+ times per week, so I know it holds up over time. It is large - holds all my sparring gear, rebreakable board, target pad, plus room for extra clothes if you are intournament mode. The mesh pocket on the side isn't meant to hold a water bottle, bu that is what I use it for and it works great. easy access to the main body of the bag.Overall, no complaints on this item at all."
4,True story of Pocahontas,"I really enjoyed this book and it has inspired me to do more research on the early days of Virginia. I liked the alternating tales of the eleven year old Pocahontas, and the woeful John Smith, who was somewhat of an egomaniac if one is to believe the author, who took the story from Smith's own diaries.It, of course, dispells all the romantic fantasies of Pocahontas saving Smith's life. In fact, she married John Rolfe, not Smith.For all his complaining about being mistreated for his lack of family connections, John Smith probably was the hero he portrays himself to be. Otherwise it seems Jamestown would have failed miserably.Some of the most interesting details involve the infighting, which at times turns deadly, the treason, selfishness, and other human faults and frailties revealed in Smith's accounts.Readers will also enjoy the story of the eleven year old Pocahontas, and the ""royal"" lifestyle she enjoys as her father's favorite daughter."
3,Pocahontas - An OK Book,"Earth to people - Pocahontas isn't a bad book, but it also isn't an exciting book. If you like the movie Avatar you might like it. It was pretty much the same. It was also really short, so I recommend it for people that are going to read for a week or something. Pocahontas would be a good summer book though. :O)"
4,"Ok, but not one of his best...","Starting off in the universe of Eon & Eternity, the story quickly moves into a different universe becomes the story of contact & adaptation to continent spanning lifeforms. Not exactly sentinent but endowed with a chemical based intelligence. The colonists live on the planet amongst the elements of these life-forms much as bacteria do in our bodies. The plot revolves around the interaction between the colonists (in the midst of a civil war), and their interaction with the native life forms.I found the book to be interesting, but a bit too slow paced to equal his best efforts."
2,More Political and Nightmarish Styled Sc. Fiction,Not a typical Syfy book. It seemed disjointed anf fragmented and although parts were interesting and I had hoped the rest of the book would continue these interesting parts I was disappointed and found myself skimming. I finished the book but would only recommend it for readers wanting rather unusual and schizophrenic flow.
2,"If you want good sci-fi, read a different Greg Bear book","I enjoyed Eon. The cover of this book says it's a ""prequel to Eon"" so I picked it up expecting to learn about the Way and Thistledown and all the mysteries brought up in Eon. Instead, I got Legacy...Do you like plants? Do you want to read about a giant, intelligent, plant-like organisms on a distant world? Do you want to read about the trials and tribulations of colonists? Well I sure didn't.This book was not what I expected and I did not enjoy it much. There was some mention of the fantastic science of Thistledown but that was not the focus of the book. This book was about human nature, charismatic leaders, ecological destruction, and the misadventures of a guy named Olmy. The end reminded me of the surrealistic river travel shown in the movie Apocalypse Now.Perhaps the story was over my head because I like Greg Bears' books but I sure did not enjoy this one."
2,Gives Eon and Eternity a bad name,"While he gets high marks for imagination about this planet with a thinking landmass/bioshpere, his storyline and his characters just don't cut it. This is despite the fact that the protagonist later appears in significant roles in Eon and Eternity. His experince here is supposed to affect his outlook in the other two books. Granted I read them in the wrong order as this prequel came much later, but it doesn't work for me on any level."
2,Slow moving tale,"One thing I enjoyed about Bear's books such as Anvil of Stars and Eon is his ability to keep the action going. This book, sadly, just drags along, and the action is mostly mundane adventure, unrelated to science fiction. This book really has nothing to do with Eon, except for a few short chapters at the beginning and the end. Ser Olmy enters a weird planet through a gate and the book takes place there. The science fiction angle is uninspired. If you were intrigued by the physics and mystery of the Way, don't follow Olmy through this gate. Surely, Bear has much more to offer than this."
1,You got to be kidding!,"Think the title is a little dumb? It is. Think that it will have an affect on what you think of the book? It will. The title is stupid and the book is even more stupid.This story is so farfetched and lame it will crack you up. It kept getting worse and worse. I wanted to see how bad it got so that's the reason why I finished it. IT DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER!!!I have no idea how I even acquired this book. It wasn't from the library, I didn't buy it a rummage sale, didn't get it a the book trader, nobody gave it to me and I certainitly wouldn't have bought it. I have no idea how I got it but I was so glad to get rid of it.I'm glad the author knew a thing or two about horses. I read too many western type books where the writer doesn't know the first thing about horses. It just takes away from the story a little. That and I thought I should say something nice about this book."
2,Doesn't last long,The bulb that projects the planets died within just a few weeks and now the motor runs but the projector doesn't move. The stars appear all the same size and color which makes finding constellations almost impossible. It's basically a fancy night light.
5,Used as homeschool curriculum,"I used this for my homeschooled daughter when she was in 9th grade. It is expands vocabulary, spelling knowledge as well as reading and comprehension. I would recommend this to family and friends."
3,AP Spanish Book Review,"As a student taking the AP spanish test soon, I was looking for a book with a comprehensive review. I found the book to be a little too simplistic in terms of content. It was good for someone who needed just a basic overview of the verbs and reading hints. However, I felt that it did not contain enough of the exceptions. However, the explanations for the practice test was very good. It covered both the Language and the Literature test."
4,Fat Joe shows his many fierce rhyme styles on this release,"For those of you who liked ""DON CARTAGENA"" you will dig ""JEALOUS ONE'S ENVY"". JOe shows off his fierce rhyme style on cuts like ""ENVY"" and ""Respect Mine"" with Wu-tangs The Chef. Joe also skillfully pays homage to all the true hip-hop artists of our time on ""Dedication"". Last but not least,one of the best tracks on the cd is the DJ Premier produced remix of ""Sh@@t Is Real"". This is my favorite track. True Fat Joe fans should pick this release up."
1,what's luvvvv,"fat-joe is a wack now with a lot of NYC artist , jose 1 is a wack album , jose 2 is a very wack album"
4,"BACK THEN I KNEW I SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN THIS,NOW I HAVE IT!","TOOK ME SOME TIME...THATS ALRIGHT,AND I'LL ALL WAYS PUT IN MIND HUSTLING IS THE KEY...HA HA HA HA!!!...I NEED TO START MAKEING MOVES!!!"
3,"Pretty, but no sound","Wind chimes are supposed to chime, I thought. This one does not, but it is gorgeous to look at! It's worth the purchase if your buying it just for decoration, but it doesn't make the pretty song the company claims it will."
3,For any dinosaur lover,They aren't very stronge but we love them. I had one break and I called the company they were wonderful and helped me with the problem right away. I will order for this company again. My kids love when I make them dinosaur cookies. The reason that I didn't rate this a 5 star is because they aren't made as well as I thought they should be.
5,A classic,"Great book with loads of information . . . most helpful! Lots of diagrams and measurements that give a far more accurate picture of kilns and firing than most books out there, and a good resources list at the back."
2,Embarrassing quasi-porn,"This book is an old-fashioned, ""shock the middle-class"" novel, circa 1962, but actually written in the mid-1990's. It is silly, overly serious, pompous, and tiresome - but I must admit that it has some great paragraphs here and there (the cemetery scene is wonderful). I read the book because Roth is taken seriously by people I respect, but after reading this I now question their judgement."
5,Roth's best,"This is Philip Roth's masterpiece. Here is where it all comes together in an unforgettable eruption: the giddy sensualism, the infuriating guilt, the brilliant narcissism and the punctured self-loathing, the mortal terror and sexual obsession. Mickey Sabbath is shocking and painful and hilarious and ultimately heartbreaking. Every time I read this book I am amazed. It is what novels are meant to be."
1,A slog,"Philip Roth is one of my favorite authors. I have read many of his works and loved them. This book was recommended by a magazine columnist (don't remember who). He said it was Roth's ""best work"" but I quit reading it when I was half way through. The protagonist is a depressed man who feels his life has been wasted and he is a complete failure. He's right about that and he has ruined many other lives as well. I have no argument with novels about unredeemed lives but nothing seems to happen as the story progresses. It is just more of the same. Try as I would to stay with this I found it too boring to continue."
2,Weak follow up to good first album,"Like many reviewers have said Bad Boy's downfall began with this weak album. Diddy or Puffy was going through his thug phase and the album shows it. The only songs that showed promise were Is This The End 2, Do You Like It and Satisy You."
1,I've had this album since the morning it came out and it...,bites... Dont buy this album unless you're into lousy music. Puffy is no good.
1,Forever? I DON'T think so!,"This cd is really poor. Why?, 'cause first of all, the beats are taken, and the lyrics are poor. Puffy is talkin about his Bentleys and his money throughout the cd. And somebody might not be interrested in that. Give it up Puff. This Cd is sol out and U can't commercialize rap like this, 'cause rap aint pop."
4,Puffy Still Can't Rap,"I still want to fall asleep when Puff raps on this album,but the beats are tight. Forever is filled with great raps from guest appearances. The beats are bumping and if puffy wasn't rapping on the songs this album would be a classic"
3,"Only good thing is Luniz, i got 5 on it!","It's like this...Puff Daddy needs to find some new beats. Personally, I really liked his lyrics in ""Satisfy You..."" But the only thing that made that song so good was with Luniz 5 on it beat. Well, if he is going to steal more beats, I guess 5 on it would be the best thing to steal."
4,Great Rap but there are some problems ...,"By all means get this cd . But if you don't want to listen to interludes, then don't get this cd ! Some songs start out with someone talking . But the songs that I like are pure songs like Satisfy you, Best Friend,and P.E 2000. But some of the interludes are pretty cool. Like track 12 and 18. But the rest of the songs are awesome. For all you parents who are wondering what the EXPLICIT LYRICS sticker is all about. On a scale of 1-10 (1 = not many bad words 10 = bad language) Puff Daddy would get a 7.5. I gave this cd a 4 star rating"
3,Forever? Maybe Not So Long,"Puff Daddy can still rap. No question. But this album raises doubts about him... If I were you I'd buy Dre, DMX, and Jay-Z instead. Better luck next time puffy."
1,Puff is Whacked!!,"This albulm sucks! Fluff daddy lacks skill, lyrics, creativity and passion for the mic. True hip hoppers already know this. It's no secret he's loosing his respect in the Rap game. Your just as fluffy if you spent $$ on this."
4,it had some nice songs with some tight beats,"some songs werent that good but there were some awesome songs with the best beats that definetely made up for the not so good ones tracks # 2,6 and 16 are the best songs in my opinion"
2,"PUFF'S NEXT CD:ONE MORE DAY, PLEASE?","THE MATERIAL ON THIS CD IS STRAIGHT UP MEDIOCORE BECAUSE OF THE GUEST APPEARANCES. HECK, IF PUFF WAS'T ON THIS CD, IT WOULD OF BEEN PRETTY GOOD!"
1,"Two words: ""shamlessly banal.""","I can't believe a man who is as blatantly vulgar and doggerel as Puffy Daddy, can profess to be a Christian. On his latest stupefied recording, he prays to God, has a benighted conversation with Jesus Christ and basically tries to amalgamate unrestrained hedonistic behavior in the face of trying to act pious!??! If that weren't enough, he sadly reiterates the overproduced nature of the first album (minus plagiarisms). His lyrics, this time around, still have absolutely nothing empathetic to say about anyone who's not living a rapacious lifestyle (unless, or course, you happen to be Puff Daddy himself). Puff and his ""posse,"" are still spitting out the same deliberately degenerate, misogynist and profusely illiterate dreck. Gee Puffy, I can hardly wait for the next hackneyed, un-avant-garde album."
1,I WAS WALKING BY AND SPRAYED PUFFY WITH MASE,PUFFY DADDY AND MASE ARE THE WORST RAPPERS EVER. DONT BUY ANY OF THEIR ALBUMS
1,PUFFY AKA FLUFFY,this iz az low az it can get. corny muzik plus a bad crew i wanted to give a 0 but i gave him credit for guest appearances. p.s:shyne iz stupid.
1,Puff Daddy is finished,"this album is absolute garbage and will go down in ""hip hop's wackest""don't buy itPuff Daddy is the new Mc Hammer... or worse: Vanilla Ice."
1,OH NO,"Puff Daddy, the most unoriginal poser the rap world has ever seen, who raps about the Hamptons, his Bentleys, and his houses, just came out with a new album? Puff...I mean Sean, you fake *** producer, go retire in the Bahamas where no one will ever hear you rap again. 14 tracks, NOT INCLUDING skits, feature another artist. Puff doesn't have a leg to stand on in the music world."
4,"This is a ""collector's item"" worth having!","I know that playa-hataz might think that this album sux, but this CD is for pure hip-hop zines only. This album is great, although I think ""No Way Out"" is much better. Tracks like ""Satisfy you"", ""Bestfriend"", ""Do This For You"",""What You Want"", ""Reverse"" and ""Do You Like It... Do You Want it"" give me a sense of peace that hip-hop music is still alive. FOREVER may not last forever but it would still shatter the charts worldwide."
2,Buy the Luniz CD instead,"Puff Daddy is a bore. All of his hits are other people's songs. Let's start from the beginning: ""Can't nobody hold me down"" is actually Matthew Wilder's ""Break My Stride"", ""I'll be Missing You"" is the Police's ""Every Breath You Take."" ""Been Around the World"" is a remake of David Bowie's ""Let's Dance."" ""Come with Me"" from the Godzilla soundtrack is actually Led Zeppelin's ""Kashmir."" And now lets take a look it this CD: The song being played on the radio right now is ""Satisfy You"" and - true to form - it's another artist's song, this time ""I got five on it"" by Luniz. Sad thing is, the Luniz version ( a huge rap hit back in 1995) is better than puffy's. So go get the Luniz CD."
4,PUFFY,"PUFFY YOU ARE THE BOOMB, YOU KNOW JUST WHAT YOU WANT AND YOU GO FOR IT, ALL YOU HATERS OUT THEIR TAKE A LEAF OUT OF PUFFYS BOOK, AND PROVE TO YOURSELF THAT ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE IF YOU JUST GET ON WITH IT."
1,"Wow, just about ruined the ""magic of Christmas""","I wish I hadn't bought this!!! The first story about Donald and the triplets is nice. The second is quite dark and dang near tells kids that Santa is a myth. The third is dark and I didn't like the messages it portrayed. Some may think this has heart and spirit, but certainly not my kind of heart and spirit!!! :(."
3,Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas,"This is great for children I think. However, my daughter 26 years of age raved about it so thought I had to have it. I was pretty disappointed from an adult's point of view but like I said, the grandkids love it."
5,Wonderful Christmas movie...,My 3 year old watched this movie every day and sometimes several times a day during the holiday season. It has a wonderful message and she loves the christmas tree in it. This is the type of movie I can take out every holiday season and make part of her tradition.
1,How long does it take for 1 item?,"My son wanted this DVD because he stated ""I have the Mickey's Twice about a Christmas, I am interested in knowing what happened in Once about a Christmas, mom can you order it for me""? I said why not I see it is pretty reasonable, so I did. I ordered on November 25, 2012 and I still have not received the DVD. Today is December 10, 2012. I am not happy with the performance of this company. I will seek another company and stray away from this one, a red flag has gone up."
2,You suck-I'm great or How to win-my way by Barney Fife,"Another book on the failings of others. I thought Bowden's book was a pathetic look into what's wrong with our military today. At least the guys pointing the fingers in his book were there and involved in the fight. You, you were on the cleanup crew monday night quarterbacking. Sadly the heroic actions of ALL those involved, from the beginning to the end of the operation, have been marginalized or cast in doubt. There was plenty of blame to go around. For veteran soldiers as Delta Force to belittle those they fought along side shows a lack of grace (and memory). Instead of showing leadership they showed contempt. Now back to you. Write about something you have first hand experience with and remember this: Pee-on medic is not = to brilliant commander."
1,"Penosa edición, mal libro","Este libro está muy mal editado. Está plagado de gazapos: faltas de ortografía y de gramática. Por ejemplo, en español no se usa coma entre el sujeto y el predicado. Hay montones de comas en esa situación. No entiendo por qué. He trabajado en editoriales durante muchos años en mi vida, y siempre los originales pasan dos revisiones. La autora también debería haberle echado un vistazo a la última revisión antes de enviarla a imprenta. Pero bueno. A parte de esto, el libro tampoco mata. Estoy de acuerdo con la crítica publicada aquí en Amazon que dice que Esquivel escribió sólo un buen libro (Como agua para chocolate). Esperaba muchísimo más de este libro, y a pesar de lo decepcionante que es leer algo que está mal escrito, continué con el afán de aprender algo sobre el mito de la Malinche. Al acabar el libro me quedé con las ganas, porque no aprendí nada. Así que le doy a este libro 1 estrella y creo que soy demasiado benevolente. No lo recomiendo."
4,"Fascinating, yet how actually interactive is it?","Just a small note to add to others' reviews: I'd say that the promise of interactivity adds to the movie more than its *actual* interactivity. I saw the film twice, the second time giving ridiculously different answers to the tests, and I got back to the very same ending. However, the possibility of exploring interviews with the characters and extra clues enhanced the experience of the film very much, and way beyond its actual movie-of-the-week merits. A nice experience, but one is left wondering how better it could have gotten (and look forward to a further and bolder experiment in storytelling)."
1,Should have read the review,I should have read the review. It also came with dead battery. I like the watch but resent the need to buy a new battery.
5,Superb New Modern Translation,"It's long overdue that the public receives a modernernized translation of Marcus Aurelius's ""Meditations"". Up until now, all the translations that we had available to us in English of this intriguing work have been, well, rather dull and ""dry"". All that is changed. Gregory Hayes has done some fine work here. I personally congratulate him, and thank him for his efforts.I still wouldn't necessarily call this book a thrill-a-minute, page-turner of suspense, but thanks to a more contemporary language-treatment, the experience is a whole lot less burdensome to get through. The ride may not be the best fun you've ever had reading a book, but it's considerably less painful now, thanks to this ""user-friendly"" updated version.Comparison to older translations shows it to be accurate in meaning and tone, and if he were alive today, I think Marcus Aurelius would recommend this version of his work for us (as modern readers) to enjoy for years to come."
3,"No sound, but tons of compliments","I love this purchase for looks, but it doesn't create the soft beautiful song that the company claims it does. It makes no noise at all. But it is nice to look at it, so I'd say it was worth the purchase for that reason alone."
4,Same Old Body Count,"This is pretty much the same old Body Count, which is good! My complaint is the production/sound quality. The production is horrible, bass is almost non-existent and the clearest sound is the vocals. Good thing I got some tweakin' software, will have to burn and mix a copy I can live with.With that said, any fan must and will get this!"
1,"low budget, quackery, on par with Weekly World News","I was expecting something truly counter-culture. I hoped to see outrageous people and things. Something funky and cool. Here is what you get:--Low budget--Poor production--Dull, unoriginal content--Unstable, ungroomed social outcasts being interviewed who swear there that time travel is possible and that they did it or they were abducted by aliens, or that they drew blood from Jesus on the cross blah blah blah--Farcical pseudo-science--Loser teenages who call themselves satanists (yawn)--Pathetic conspiracy theories that are not even original or thought-provokingCOMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!!"
2,Great!!! ....at first,"At first it started to work great and I could see clearly on the screen but after a month or two, the screen started getting darker and darker and now I can't see anything on it. I still use it because the sound that comes through is ok and I can hear when people pull in the driveway... but it's not too convenient since leaves rustling in the wind sounds like a car pulling into the rocky driveway.Save your money and buy something that will work more than a few months."
4,Great book to get boys to read,"The New Captain Underpants Collection: Box Set (Books 1-5)Although girls / moms might not find it's too funny, it's funny for 3rd grade boys. My son (8 yrs old, 3rd grade) - picked up a book and would carry it everywhere until he finished it. While driving to school or to run errands, instead of bothering his sister, he sits quietly and reads."
2,Bummer if you need to return,"Books arrived as described, BUT when I wanted to return them UNOPENED they wanted to charge me for shipping! Part of the reason I order online is because I haven't had to pay for returns and the only reason I wanted to return was because te day before they arrived I got a better deal through the school. Had this happened with something I bought in a store this wouldn't have been a issue"
1,only received 4 out of the 5 book set,i only received 4 of the 5 books in the set. it took almost a month to get the books. not good.
3,Kids love poopy talk,"My daughter discovered the Captain Underpants series a couple of months ago and I have to say, at first I wasn't sure I wanted to encourage her reading nonsense material. When I read the titles of the books, I had such a laugh and it really hit me why some kids love these books--they are sooo funny and it's exactly the kind of thing that a attracts a child. Kids love potty talk and silly pictures and the seeing Harold and his friend get into constant trouble with the principle at their school. These jokesters are forever playing pranks and trying to get themselves out of trouble. Yes, it's complete nonsense, but, it got my daugther to read chapter books! she's hooked. She loves to read and it's her love for reading that I'm encouraging not the nonsense."
5,Great for young readers!,"I bought the first Captain Underpants book for my 5 year old. We read it at night and we both laughed and laughed. Story time in our house is now so enjoyable that I find that I cannot stop reading to him. We have read all 8 books and are waiting for #9. This is a wonderful series that isn't boring or redundant. You can change words that you might be uncomfortable with (stupid, dumb) and the books are still enjoyable. I expect to be reading them to my younger son next year.I highly recommend Captain Underpants for the young and the old. They are great fun and the Flip-O-Rama adds to the laughter. Enjoy!!"
4,Captain Underpants,The New Captain Underpants Collection: Box Set (Books 1-5)Entertaining and easy to read. The kids love these books.
4,"Books, but no stickers","The books are in good shape. The box was slightly damaged, probably during shipping. The only problem is that on the front of the case it prominently says ""stickers inside"", but there are no stickers neither next to the books nor in the books (as with some other Underpants' books.)"
5,Great Book,"The experiences, observations and learning Ann Jones encountered while staying in Kabul are eye opening to say the least. The treatment of the Afghan women is heart wrenching. Very sad book, but a good one!"
4,Jeez James!,"James, get over yourself!I have zero desire to haul out a record player and scout around for gems. I just wanna invite all my hep cats around and have this playing nonchanlently in the background, making me instantly cool. lol"
3,This was great on VHS but the DVD is a very poor copy.,"I have the Fabulous Flasher videos on VHS and wanted to get all the benifits of having them on DVD. But the transfer to DVD left a lot to be desired. The girls are beautiful and all that public exposure is definately a turn-on, but the video is very poor quality with grainy pixelation too obvious to be ingnored. ...must have been done when video transfer was in its infancy."
4,Great reflection on growing up in the surfing culture,"Gutierrez presents about 20 short stories, which seem mostly autobiographical, about growing up and learning to surf. His coming of age is intertwined with literal re-tellings and metaphors of how both he and surfing influenced each other. Of the short stories, many do a wonderful job of capturing the mood and atmosphere that can still be found on the beach at dawn. It was these parts that really captures the reader. An easy read, and a must for anybody who is curious about the surfing community or who just wants to be a little more stoked on surfing."
1,John Grisham Courtroom Collection,"i have never been so disappointed in the quality of these movies. This is the year 2011 and to have to ""flip"" the dvd over to watch the second half is just plain stupid. It's too late for me to return these movies, but you can be sure they will go in the next garage/yard sale I have. Nowhere on the packaging or before I ordered did it say that I needed to ""flip"" the dvd during watching."
4,Good value,A great way to revisit the movies of John Grisham. I got as a gift and all the movies are are there. There was a playback issue.
3,"Not So ""10-Year Battery""","Bought this item on September 10, 2008 and by yesterday the battery was gone. Anyway for such price, I got way more than I expected."
1,not comparable to a CHI,"I bought this flat iron after my CHI broke on me after ONE month. I was so angry, that even though I have used chi irons my entire life, I did not want to purchase another. I tried this flat iron instead of the CHI. I brought it back the very next day. Although it is in the same price range, there is no comparison to a CHI. My hair texture is very thick and wavy, I have used flat irons ever since I was very young to tame my hair. It is nearly to my back so very long as well. This flat iron was complete junk to me! First of all, it took 5-10 minutes to get hot enough to style with it. It does not curl well like you can with a CHI flat iron. It barely could straighten my hair. I won't stray from a CHI again."
2,Only ok!!!,"So I was super excited to get this flat iron, but ended up very disappointed after the first use!! This flat iron curls beautifully but for some reason if I use it on my mixed/curly hair to straighten, it does not do the job good at all!!! My cheap Jilbere (the light grey one with red plates) straightens my hair much better leaving it soft, silky and bouncy. The FHI iron leaves my hair dull and dry and gives it a horrible texture when straightening... But like I said earlier, it curls very very very nicely so i use the Jilbere to straighten and the FHI to curl...lol"
1,hot plates did not touch,"The plates did not touch so my hair went right through the iron, didn't see at first this was then problem so after this discovery I sent it back"
1,Didn't turn on,I had to return this iron because when I plugged it in nothing happened! I ended up buying the same iron directly from my salon to get a warranty. Amazon was helpful in taking my return and refunding me
5,Happy Customer,"I was a little nervous buying this product but to my surpise it works great. As long as you mosturize your hair before styling you are good to go. Make sure you sure the appropriate oil for straightening your hair too! But, i love this product. I haven't been to the hair dresser since i brought my FHI Heat Platform 1 Inch Professional Ceramic Tourmaline Styling Iron with Nano-Fuzeion Technology."
2,The iron came broken,"There was a problem with the iron when it arrived. I previously had the same model, and it lasted four years. In the end, my first iron started shorting, so I decided to purchase a new one. I was very disappointed to find that the new one arrived and started shorting out immediately. I decided to return the iron and get another type since this appears to be a problem with the FHI Platform."
3,Satisfied and Disappointed,"I brought this product Jan 2012 and they worked very well until sometime in Nov 2012. Then in Dec 2012 they stopped working. It seemed like a short in the cord; sometimes they would turn on when plugged in but I would have to wiggle the cord and then other times they wouldn't. So since I didn't think they were worth me. burning down my house, I just put them back in their box and decided to buy another pair but not from an online seller. I then decided that the because this product is still being sold on Amazon and at a higher cost than what I paid, I decided that the seller and others needed to know that this product was defective."
4,It takes good care of my hair,"I bleach and color my hair every month and obviously use flat iron. So my hair was taken a beat. This flat iron does a nice job and is helping my hair to get smoother and healthier. The previous iron I had just use to add to the problem. I don't use it in the highest setting, it isn't necessary. It doesn't work miracles, no iron does. But it does a very nice job taking care of your hair and straighten it. It was voted #2 iron of 2007. And the price in Amazon is the best around!!! (at least when I wrote this review) Enjoy :D"
5,Terrific flat iron!,"This is my second FHI flat iron and it is wonderful. My other one works fine, but I wanted to try this one. It heats up fast, gets my hair straight and silky smooth and it stays that way. I love it!!"
4,great product,"I was using a cheap flat iron because I don't straighten my hair often and I didn't want to invest in an expensive straightener, but using a $10 flat iron was terrible. My hair would get pulled and it would take an hour to style my hair. I would usually end up damaging my hair and looking frizzy. The FHI is so much better! I like using it, it doesn't hurt. I spend less than 30 minutes straightening my hair, and it looks smooth and pretty. I am still figuring out how to flip the ends, but that takes practice. This is a great product, definitely worth the investment!"
1,Not Satisfied,"I bought this flat iron and returned it two weeks later, for the money that is wanted for it, it is not worth it. I purchased a jose' eber flat iron who is a world known celebrity stylist, although it is more expensive it is so worth the money. It truly eliminates frizz and if you are looking for a quality product this flat iron is well worth the money. It doesnt even show temperature setting but heats up so hot it smokes but does not damage hair because it has infrared, truly amazing and well worth the money. Oh and I am African American with fine to medium hair and it really does the trick, check out his site."
1,Amazon Not Authorized Seller = No Warranty!,"Mostly I consider Amazon.com to be THE top seller on the Internet due to their excellent customer service policy and their flexible ordering system. However, I consider it a MAJOR flaw on Amazon's part that they are not presently disclosing in the listing for this item that Amazon is not an authorized reseller and that the manufacturer will therefore not honor any warranty on this item. By not disclosing that Amazon is not authorized and that there is no warranty: 1) Amazon is legally responsibility for fulfilling the terms of the warranty. 2) Much worse, not disclosing that there is no warranty on THIS item puts the warranty on every other item sold by Amazon in doubt. I certainly hope that Amazon gets on the ball and addresses this issue quickly."
3,"Good product, but only lasts a year","If I'd written a review a week ago, I'd have given this item 4 stars. It makes my hair very managable and I really like the look. Two minor issues that I did not like: (1) the cord gets very tangled and makes it hard to manuver at times, and (2) the temperature setting is on a dial and makes it very easy to change the degrees without realizing you've done so. But all in all, I was pretty happy with it. Until yesterday. When it. JUST. Quit. Working. Period. Kaput. It will not turn on anymore (and yes, I checked it in different outlets.) Three weeks after the 1-year warranty expired. Convenient ... for the manufacturer.I will be replacing it, but I think I'm going to try a different brand."
3,The Workwoman's Guide,"I ordered this book because I thought it had pictures of historic window treatments - which it did, but not very many, and not very detailed. My mistake."
2,A Grand Tour of the Jungles of Borneo,"Mozart's earliest symphonies are deeply appealing to anyone who remembers their boyhood. They encapsulate the exhilaration of being so young and so alive. Moreover, in this instance it was a charming idea to ask Harnoncourt's grandchildren and the conductor himself to recite various letters written by the Mozarts during the course of their Grand Tour.But the charm ends there.If you want to hear these miraculous works being conducted by the Wild Man of Borneo, look no further: this offering is for you. Harnoncourt is at his gruffest. He leeches all the grace from these works. Nor has Harnoncourt mellowed over the years: his trademarks as a conductor - the willful tempos and explosive accents - have yet to abate even as the clock winds down.Both Mackerras on TeldecMozart The Symphoniesand indeed Bohm on DGMozart: The Symphoniesare better attuned to the youthful elation of these works."
4,With not much to go on.,"I don't have much to go on, but I quickly browsed this book in an art store and found it quite good as far as simplicity and ""what the beginning artist should have."" I would recommend it to the beginner without reservation."
2,shallow and contrived,"I am surprised to find so many positive reviews of this book. The writing style is pleasant, but the plot is unbelievable, illogical, and forced. The intrigue that Dunlap tries so hard to create is just downright silly. As one reviewer commented, the characters are ""ill-defined"" and do things that ""defy logic."" I couldn't agree more. For instance, a maid becomes single-mindedly bent on destroying Emilie because of a pair of lost slippers. Perhaps scenarios like this could be made believable in the hands of some authors, but Dunlap can't pull it off. One thing I do credit the author for, however, is leaving out gratuitous and detailed sexual themes and descriptions.There is nothing more unsatisfying in a novel than one-dimensional characters, and this book was a chore to complete. Even lousy plots can often be forgiven if only the characters have depth; this book delivers neither. Given Dunlap's education, I expected a lot more from ""Emilie's Voice."""
1,Lame spin-off of a lamer show,"I got this one on sale. Terrance And Philip are Itchy And Scratchy, except of course that Terrance And Philip thrive on fart jokes and nothing else. The idea of using Saddam Hussein as a main character just shows how these guys have to scrape the barrel for ""inspiration"". As bad as this is, however, the actual South Park show is still worse."
4,Great Value for hobbist,"This product works very well. It is much more comfortable on my hands than a traditional, cheap, crimper. It holds wire very well and makes crimping a snap. It also features a ratchet release in case you load the wrong terminal or are trying to crimp the wrong type of wire per terminal."
5,Best Wrinkle Creme,"I have used StriVectin-SD for several years. It is the best with reduced wrinkles noticed within 5 minutes. Every morning, I use a dab of the regular 4oz creme on my face with this 1.3oz eye creme around my eyes since the latter has a mint extract not good for eye area. Seems a little expensive until you realize that each tube last just about a year!"
5,Scientology is an evil CULT,I wish there were more stories about this cult that has stolen so many lives. Cheers to TIME! I wish everyone knew the truth!
3,A Bit One-Noted,"I didn't dislike this book, but I did find the story line rather monotonous and predictable, with very few twists, and the main character the obvious Byronic type, and not fully developed. I appreciated it being told in a pseudo-victorian style, but I felt that the language was overly dramatic and rather bald, particularly towards the end. It was also obviously written by an American, too--not that there's anything wrong with that, of course--just that the language was a bit ""off"" as well as the setting. It just didn't seem to be written by a person who knew London or England very well, or at least didn't convey his knowledge fully. I don't think that this will become a classic, just another filler until the ultimate wearwolf book comes along."
4,"Excellent early Dots material, but beware!","This is was a great, early album by the Dots. However, buyers should be forewarned that it's also very short -- you'll be paying the price of a full-length album for only 24 minutes of music. That said, it's a great little release, a welcome darkly humorous offering after the conceptual gloom of ""The Tower."" The album also points towards the experimentalism and greater sonic pallette of later albums such as ""Asylum."" Many of the tracks are ingenious mock commercials for non-existent products, combining social criticism with black comedy. The lyrics of the first track, for example, an insanely up-beat techno-pop ditty, describe a violent attack upon a young man, who crawls into a house and bleeds his life out upon the floor. ""Better get the BLASTO out to blast away the stains. Nothing's better!"", the narrator cheerfully comments. Other themes explored on this album include sex with androids, pornographic videos, the apocalypse, and cat food."
1,There are better one's out there!!!,"This scale was not even close to what I hoped it would be. The size left a lot to be desired. I don't know if there were measurments in the description, but very small would have been enough. When I received them, the front dials had broken off and the storage containers that you put the food in were cracked. Very cheap, very small, and very bad are about all I can say.Thank God AMAZON is soooo great! They of course took the two I ordered right back and I got a full refund."
3,Kitchen Scales,"This scale is really really small! But apart from that it's pretty good. It does the job, easy to read, clean and store."
5,Love this!,"I love that this scale can weigh things with or without the container on it, you just adjust it with a little knob on the top, that's cool. Also, when you are all done with it, the scales fit inside the container so you can keep it from getting dirty and to save space. That's awesome!"
2,Useful but should be included,Do you need some extra protection on your awesome new gauge? Yes you do; but do you need to pay so much for a chunk of rubber? No. All I can say is; duct tape and inner tube. Be a man...
5,Rubber Gauge Protector,"Only had our Moroso Gauge for a couple of weeks now, but the rubber protector seems essential. The gauge itself is simple a pressed steel shell for the inner works and offers no protection from Minor knocks."
1,do not buy,"i bought this pump it did not work hayward sent a tech they tried hooking up a wrong motor week later came back with a new motor hooked it up that one also didnt work 3 weeks later still dont have a pump water turn really bad hayward does not want to do anything about it saying ""they dont make the motors take it out with the motor company""so take it from my bad situation DO NOT BUY A HAYWARD"
4,Very Informative!,"I really enjoyed this book, and it helped me realize that the feelings that I've been having toward women for the majority of my life are common and lots of other females have been in the same boat as me. The only semi-negative message I got from the book was ""pretty popular girls can be lesbians, too""."
5,I'm not addicted to this show,....okay maybe I am addicted to this show.If you watched this show you would be too.It has really good plot twists and turns.It also has interesting ways to tell the main plot of the story without giving you too much information.Damien Lewis was the only choice for this show and he does what he does really well.If your not watching this show you should be.
3,ILLOGICAL DIALOGUE,"I have enjoyed Life Season I, but sometimes the dialogue is so stupid and illogical that it breaks the mood, and you wonder how the hell that sequence of words/sentences got by the director and the writers. Most of the time, these stupid phrases get put in the mouth of Dani Reese.The best example is the episode Serious Control Issues. A killer has grabbed a guitar pick that the victim supposedly used and left in his delivery truck. He swallows it. In interrogation, Reese tells the suspect that the lab is going to find her DNA on the pick and prove that he killed the girl. Yeah right, through his digestive system and out his rear end, and it's going to prove that he killed the girl. And the killer confesses.Bits of dialogue like this are scattered throughout the episodes. And each is like a slap in the face."
2,Damien Lewis misses the mark,"I love Damien Lewis; he was awesome in Band of Brothers. But everything else I've seen him in since, has failed to win me over including this new show which I wanted to like. His character (who gets out of prison for a murder he didn't do after 12 years,)is a cop who is quirky and spouts zen phiolosophy to his gorgeous partner all day. Either you like the main characters 'quirky' personality and will get into the show; or you won't which is what I experienced.In addition the flash back storytelling style grew tiresome quickly; Robin Weigert as his Captain and San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsome's Wife (Jennifer Siebold)both good actors, play very unlikable characters. In fact only Adam Arkin as Damien's ex-con financial advisor, is 'normal' and enjoyable to watch here. A big disappointment as a summer replacement show; get ""Burn Notice"" instead--it's great!l"
5,It just keeps getting better,"The show started off a little shaky, seeming not to know what its balance between procedural and character drama should be. But, considering the characters have all been fantastic from the start, the more recent turn in that direction is very smart. Damian Lewis has always been a talented actor, but this is one of his most riveting performances ever. I've never seen a character like Charlie Crews, and now I'm dying to see more of him. As he gets deeper into the conspiracy to frame him, all the little layers are getting pulled back. I sincerely hope NBC realizes what a gem they have here and starts giving it better promotions."
5,"Obtuse, irregular, appealing chemistry","This is not the typical cops and robbers series. It provides a different perspective to the ""job"" than most. A Zen officer and an ex-junkie detective working against a department who would like them to fail.The chemistry between Reis and Crews reminds me of Beckett and Castle and the characters played by Bruce Willis and Sybal Sheppard in ""Moonlighting."" Wonderfully done.Each segment stands well on its own; but the series is excellent. WHY was this series cancelled? I loved both season one and season two."
4,Good British History Supplement,"The poems are longer and catchy. Some have to humorously stretch to find a rhyme, making them almost Seuss-like.This book was revised in the 50's and goes from William I to Elizabeth II, making it current. Though, the poem about Queen Elizabeth is quite short and is more of an ending poem to the whole book.From an American standpoint, I call this book a good supplement. Looking at each poem individually, it doesn't give quite enough information to fully make sense unless you have a decent background of the British Kings and Queens. If your child (or parents too) have an interest in British history, I recommend getting this book together with Our Island Story by H.E. Marshall or having online resources at the ready."
5,Cute kid's chair,I got this for my nine month old daughter. She's tall for her age and loves her older brother's chair so I figured it was time for her own. The material is kind of like a vinyl which is great because my son's plush chair is incredibly hard to clean. The ottoman is super cute (both my kids try to sit on it and play with it). It is sturdy and well made. I'm very happy with my purchase.
2,Nothing but a commercial,"Turner Entertainment owns the MGM film library. Turner shows the library on Turner Classic Movies. When the Lion Roars is nothing but a promotional showcase for TCM. It's well put together, but what's here is nothing but warmed-over clips and breathless fan mag build-up. There's nothing critical here, nothing that provides insight, only puff pieces on movies you'll be seeing on TCM. This isn't a documentary but a commerical."
4,Excellent romance read.,"If you like this genre (erotic regency), you will not be disappointed. The relationship between the reluctant-but-forced-into conning heroine and the determined-not-to-be-conned hero is imaginatively developed. An delicious psycho-erotic tension (so productive to escapist fantasy!) between the two strong-willed characters is maintained from beginning to conclusion. This is the type of novel that Georgette Heyer might have written if she'd had a post-sexual liberation mind-set."
5,"Virtue, a Jane Feather Regency Romance","I just finished reading this in the paperback version and felt the characters and plot were very well developed. It's hard to believe the Davenports' mother was as uncaring as she was portrayed, but I've met a similar type. The up and down romance between Judith and Marcus was very poignant. Enjoy!"
1,Spanking won't 'cure' ADD.,"Well, if you believe ADD is a myth, and is just an excuse for ""Highly Misbehaving"", and you believe this inattentive behavior can be cured by strict discipline including 3 sharp spanks at each incident, here's your book. Not for me. I gagged on this one. I guess it's good to have read it, to see the 'other side', to know the arguments that opponents to ADD treatment maintain, to understand why my kid becomes a political battlefield. I found Dr. Daniel Amen's ""Healing ADD"" much more scientific and helpful."
5,A modern masterpiece,"Here are 4 reasons why this is the best film ever: 1. It has more depth and intrigue than Citizen Kane 2. It has more excitement than Star Wars 3. It has better dialogue and humor than Pulp Fiction 4. It has Brando's monkey sidekick. I have to go now, the men in white uniforms are coming for me. They want me to take my medicine. Help! Help!"
2,"""Marlon, we hardly knew ye!""","No contender, here! This has to be one of the worst films ever made. Taking a classic from one of the masters of the sci-fi genre and turning it into this mishmash borders on sacrilege. Brando should have declined this one and stayed in his Polynesian paradise.Its only saving grace: the always dependable Val Gilmer who must have had a great time mimicking Brando in one scene."
1,Burn Hollywood Burn!,Hollywood gets its dirty cliched mits onto this one and absolutely tears the soul out of this brilliant novel. You'd think that Brando would no better!
2,I paid $5 for this DVD,"and that was $3 too much! I had recently read the classic H G Wells' novel on which the movie is based and wanted to see the latest theatrical adaptation of it. I know some reviewers liked the campiness of this movie, even elevating it to cult-classic status. I, however, am not a fan. Yes, there are some strong performances (I actually liked Brando and Kilmer in their roles), but the lead actors were rather weak and the story was drastically changed in the up-dating. Unfortunately, I don't think there is a more decent movie version of the novel, so if you are planning to show this as a tie-in to the book (I work as a teacher), you might use it as a counterpoint to the novel (eg, Why were things changed from Wells' original?)"
2,It is just not enough...,"This book can give you a good overview of Visual Basic, but it is not going too deep into details. Also, it did not give tasks that I could do on my own. I was only retyping the code and reading an explanation for it, which is not enough for a beginning programmer..."
3,Nice layout but teaches poor progarmming pracitces,"Based on the reviews of others, I selected this book as a text for my VB class. While the book layout and topic are well done, the author introduces very poor programming practices. He likes use of Variant data types, which are very inefficient. Other bad habits are the way that variable types are declarated. My students gave a very lukewarm reception to this book. You can learn to program in VB using this book, but you will not learn good programming habits."
3,nice introduction to VB but lacking depth,"This book is difficult to rate. I would highly recommend it for someone with NO programming experience. The writing is very clear and is easy to follow. Other than that, it is a decent overview of VB if you have never programmed in VB. It touches many areas of the language. However, it fails to explain concepts fully and is of little use after it's been read. I would have given the book a better review except that it claims to be written for people with programming experience and even VB experience. It is of definite use to people who have never programmed before, but of limited value to experienced programmers."
5,Excellent novel with deffinite room for more.,"Acorna's People is my favorite in the Acorna series. It is action-packed and romantic. Acorna is basically a full-grown Linyarii by this time and is prepared to choose a life mate. The one she chooses could have a book of his own, he has been through so much. This novel takes place on the new Linyarii home world and it is fascinating how Acorna has been introduced to her people and how she is coping with them on their planet. It is evident that Acorna has a little bit of the ""barbaric"" humans in her and it takes her awhile to get used to some of her people's customs. This novel is fast-paced and exciting. It is one of my new favorite books. There is deffinetely room for a sequel. I thought that a lot of things were left out of this trilogy. For example, we never found out if Acorna's body will stabilize or if in a few years she will be old. Overall, this book had a strong hold on me and I found it hard to put down. I give it five stars."
2,No Regina Spektor --- if that is why you're renting this episode,"I got this one because of the regina spektor performance. Unfortunately, I assumed it would be included. It was not. Just Drew Barrymore and a bunch of not too funny skits (except for the tampax one, it was funny)"
2,"Caution, Edited Episode","I purchase this SNL episode mainly because I very much enjoyed Joseph Gordon-Levitt's opening song and dance number. It's the highlight of the show. And yet after I downloaded it, I noticed it wasn't included. This episode is only 49 minutes instead of the normal 57 minutes. It is missing the first 8 minutes. Why is Amazon selling incomplete episodes of SNL without stating that there are portions missing? If you are expected a full episode for your money, you will be disappointed. You have been warned."
3,Performances not included :(,"Like another viewer said, this does NOT include her performances. Given that I basically bought this for her performances I was extremely dissapointed. You'd think if you bought the whole episode you'd get the whole episode, which includes her performances. However, nope, you get the skits and the monolauge, but not the performances. Kind of a rip off and false advertising, if you ask me."
2,Blaa Blaa Blaa Blatt Blatt Blatt,This book is a extreamly verbous book that discusses the political and economic rights of andean women through out history.
4,Great for fine tuning your sophistication skills,"This book gives you many of the ins and outs of a sophisticated lifestyle. It contains many great information tid-bits and even gives you acurate pronunciations of words that every sophisticated person should know. It was a entertaining book to read, almost like a up to date, everyday life ettique book. Definity something worth its money."
3,"This is ok for flies but not small bugs, not gnats!",I love this product but the electrified wires are too far apart to kill annoying gnats. My mother found and bought one for me that has horizontal electrified lines along with vertical lines like a tennis racket and I love it more because it kills even the gnats 99.9% of the time with one wave of the racket.... and it cost half as much as this one but doesn't have the one off switch so you'd have to make sure little ones don't shock themselves if they get a hold of it.
4,Spanish Book,Product delivered as described. Did not respond to my inquiry about the delivery status.
5,"Marryanne has inspired me to look at life differently,","I met Marryanne in 1988, at a unity church, At first, Idid not know what to think of her teachings. The I went on a three day retreat. I had been living with AIDS for 2 years at the time.Once at the retreat, I became totally focus on her words. It was such an inpact, that by the time I returned home My best friend Mark came over to see how was my visit. After a few minutes, he saif to me, :Michael who are you, there is something very different about you site, there is a glow about you. Its like your Moses with the ten commandments. What a miracle you are. Mark started listening to these tapes that I purchased gor Marryanne. He himself had a new light about him.To this day he prases me for me introducing Marryanne to his life.I was once in a coma for 7 1/2 months. The teachings of the course amd Marryanne really helpped me come back. I am truely thankful for this anglel,""Marry Anne.Thank youMichael Joshua Adams, seattle Washington 9/2002"
5,Great philosophy despite the language,"One could hardly expect a rational lawyer, scientist at heart, and agnostic to write such a glowing review of Ms. Williams' new age philosophy. But this book is superb! As a recovering catholic, the language is a bit hard to digest. But if you can get beyond the emotional blocks on the christian terminology, the philosophy she lays out teaches an extrodinarily powerful way to view the many challenges we face in life. This is an excellent book."
4,The Course and Marianne,"I have known and known of Marianne Williamson for several years, and know of the inner battles she had until she discovered the Course on Miracles. I believe this book is good for those who have lost sight of our purpose on Earth, and those who may need a swift kick of unconditional love to get them on the right path. Much like Louise Hay, Rayna Gangi, Andrew Weil, and others, Marianne tries to show us that love is possible, necessary, and expected."
5,Very accessible!,Love having this on my on iPad. It makes it so convenient and easy to access anytime. I really love it!
3,so what?,"We've heard all this information enough. It's just another new age book about love, which is unnecessary and dreadfully boring. I kept waiting for a good morsel to come my way, but it was a yawnfest. At page 70, I began reading faster and faster-I skimmed up to page 130 amd stopped--couldn't take it anymore. The Conversations with God books are much more interesting (although book 2 is filled with useless info). Good spiritual books are hard to find."
5,A book worth reading and reading again and again,Every now and then I read a book that changes my perspective in a very profound way. For me this was one of those books. I would encourage anyone that is struggling with life's lessons to read this book.
1,Too flimsy,"Too flimsy, streched out and is about to break at the connection to the clasps. Sorry I bought it now."
2,Dissapointing,I have to say first that I'm not a huge Canned Heat fan as I see them as quite mediocre compared to a group like Butterfield Blues Band. I am however a huge John lee Hooker fan and was extremely disappointed he is only on 3 of the 10 songs. The title of the album is pretty misleading and I feel a bit cheated. If you are like me and love John Lee but find Canned Heat to be so-so skip this one and get the original Hooker 'N Heat 2 CD set and you'll be much happier. AS I recall Hooker is on almost every song on it. It isn't live but is more like a jam session and has some interesting chit chat between John lee and the band. I give that one 4 stars out of 5.
1,Insight guides Northern Italy (Insight Guides),"I have bought this book around 10 days ago and must say that I am very disappointed about its content. I bought it because of the superb star rating it had. It is undoubtedly not ideal at all for someone who will be fending for himself whilst in Italy as all it has is superb photography and a good description of the various locations, but no info on tourist info offices, how to get to the various locations, emergency numbers etc. I sincerely can only suggest it to somebody who will be guided by somebody who is very familiar with the territory. I must say it is not written for the budget traveller and the few hotels and restaurants which are suggested at the back of the book are too expensive to even be considered by a budget traveller. Unfortunately I had received a large number excellent brochures from the various tourist offices in Italy which I obtained from Let's go Italy and I must say I have found this book a pure waste of good money."
3,Smaller than I thought it would be,"I knew that Lucas was 12 inches long but somehow I pictured him bigger in the size of his body, head, and limbs. My son has a teddy bear that is 12 inches long but looks much bigger when put next to lukas. Anyway, considering that, I feel it was overpriced. we had some 12 to 14 inch doll clothes that I thought would fit lukas but no such luck! My son likes him ok but prefers bigger soft toys like his teddy tear. That said, Lukas seems well made and is really cute just a little too small. If I had seen this doll at the store, I wouldn't of bought it because of the size and price."
1,HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!,"WHAT WAS WORSE, HERCULES OR HERCULES ZERO TO HERO? THEY TIE. THIS MOVIE HAS DOZENS OF THINGS WRONG WITH IT. SINCE WHEN DOES ZUES BE MORTAL WHENEVER HE WANTS TO? HE COULD EASILY DIE! WELL, HERES THE PLOT. HERULES TELLS ABOUT HIS YOUNGER YEARS AS A HIGH SCHOOL KID. HE GOES TO SOME GREEK ACADEMY. VERY FUNNY, DISNEY. AND HE SAVES THE DAY A FEW TIMES. ANYONE WITH A I.Q. OF O.0000001 AND ABOVE SOULD NOT SEE THIS MOVIE!!!"
4,A very Challenging Read,"This book interested me because of my general like of Dan Simmons, the fact that it was horror, and the general good reviews and raves about this book. After finishing the book, I realized that this is a book that probably can't be read in one sitting. I could only read 2-3 chapters at a time. The beginning of the book is a bit slow, but as the book goes along, the story becomes more and more interesting. I like that the reader never really feels that the characters are safe, which really makes the suspense strong and present throughout. I kept picturing this book as some sort of HBO miniseries. Anyways, if you read Dan Simmons, you know what you're going to get, and this is one of his better books, reminding me most of The Terror."
2,Painfully dull,"I ADORE long horror books. The longer, the better. So, after seeing the size, and hearing so many kudos for Carrion Comfort, I snatched it right up and couldn't WAIT to begin reading. Ugh. I tried 3 times to get past the 100 page point, and couldn't do it. Slow. Dull. Boring. I've heard this book called an epic. I disagree vehemently. An epic should illicit strong emotions from the reader. An epic should be an incredible testimony of some sort, whether it be GOOD versus EVIL, or whatever. You want to read an epic in the horror genre? King's ""The Stand."" A masterpiece. It's incredibly readable. The characters are fascinating. It's exciting. It's ACCESSIBLE. Same goes for McCammon's ""Swan Song."" THOSE are epics. In my opinion, this doesn't come anywhere close. Epic BOREDOM, more like it. Maybe I'll pick it up some day and try again. But as long as I keep finding other, more interesting horror novels, I don't see the need."
5,how some people prey on the weakness of others,"The best of today's new writers is Dan Simmons. Hisunderstanding of people and master control of the art ofwriting transforms this novel into one scary insight intothe lives of vultures in our society. Makes Stephen Kinghorror look like comic book reading. Simmons is hard tolabel, as he writes sf/horror/fantasy, but he is just amaster at fiction."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"Dan Simmons has produce a horror novel of the disturbing kind. The vampires in this book are of a different stripe, being mainly concerned with mental control and degradation, not your average bloodsucking.A young man comes across them in a nazi concentration camp, and decades later is still hunting them down.The are more than one of these mindsuckers, and they have an annual gathering to indulge their horrific appetites.The protagonist of the piece wants to get in and put an end to it."
2,A completely disappointing novlel by one of my favorite authors,"I bought this book for my Kindle based both on my previous experience with Mr.Simmons' work which I thoroughly enjoyed and on a review by Stephen King in which he called it ""one of the three best horror books of the 20th century."" I am so glad this wasn't the first Simmons' book I read because I would have never read another and might have missed out on the pleasure his previous books have given me.The book started off well enough and I anticipated a good scary tale. It quickly became, however, an endless, boring hodgepodge of shifting scenes and confusing characters. I forced myself to finish it hoping for something redeeming. Alas this was not to be.Shame on Stephen King. I seriously doubt that he read this book and that his review was his honest opinion of it."
2,Long and Dry,"I picked up this book based on a shining recommendation from a friend. Because I downloaded it, I didn't realise it was as lengthy as it was until I spotted it in a bookstore, although length doesn't typically bother me, especially when I'm hauling all the pages around on an e-reader. I made it two and a half chapters in before I had to set it aside and chalk it up as a lost cause. I simply can't get past the unnecessary details and the overall dryness with which it's written. I found (and, when I go back to try again, still find) myself zoning out while I'm still reading, acknowledging words but not stringing them together into meaningful sentences, and I don't know that any of the characters are have enough character to make it worth continuing. I hear Dan Simmons has better books; I'm not sure this hasn't put me off him entirely, but this was a poor introduction to his storytelling and has made me wary of any of his other novels."
5,Addictive even after 4 reading!,"This is the best SciFi or Horror book I've ever read. And I've read many over the last 25 years. King, McCammon, Barker, Cussler, Asimov, Heinlen, etc. The book has a horror tone, but the ""abilities"" of the characters seems more in line with SciFi and ""mental mutants."" The amount of detail, combined with the fast pace of this book and total depravity of the characters make it nearly impossible to place down once you get past the first 15 pages. It just pulls you in. Interestingly, this is one of only two books by Simmons that I've been able to finish -- but this one I couldn't stop reading. Most writers can't seem to develop characters without the story really slowing down. But in Carrion Comfort, these sections of the story are especially captivating. I've read this 4 times over the last 10 years -- more than any book other than a couple by Niven."
3,Edit some of the fluff.,"For a book with this many awards it sure was dull. God, talk about fluff...at least 300 pages of it. At times this book is exciting (the whole Philly thing), but it can also drag like a wet turd through a sand lot! Why do some authors just continue on and on when the added prose adds nothing to the plot? Simmons is very bad about this."
5,Great Show!,"Moonlight was cast very well, with cohesive and believable characters that compliment each other. The on-screen chemistry between Mick and Beth is one of the very best I've seen and the story line is tragically sweet. This show put a fresh coat of paint on the vampire genre, and became quickly addictive.It really is too bad that this was only on for 1 season. I didn't even know about it until it was on SciFi channel in reruns. Now I can't get enough of it. Don't know why CBS axed this show and left some of the other dribble on like Ghost Whisperer and NCIS. Anyway, I wish it hadn't been cancelled. It was an excellent first season."
3,Eye Candy,"I never missed an episode when this was on TV and I plan to buy a copy when it's released. That in mind, it is with a great fondness in my heart that I say that this show is one of those car wrecks that you're embarrassed to admit to people that you like. Very entertaining and fun to watch (Josef gets all the best lines) but Mick gets his behind handed to him at least once an episode, causing one of my friends to remark that he's the only vampire in history who really should carry pepper spray."
4,Moonlight TV Series,"DVD package came in good condition, at a reasonable rate and in a reasonable time."
2,No EXTRAS on this DVD,"Don't get me wrong I LOVE Moonlight, but the TPTB did not even care enough about the fans to put bloopers, interviews with stars/directors, etc on the DVD. I had all the eps on DVD without commercials already, could have saved my money. I was looking forward to all the extras that are on every DVD that I have, but nope, nada, nothing."
2,Bad Disks,"I ordered this for my wife. The first disk episode 3 Dr. Feelgood and 4 Fever would not work on either of our DVD players, so I returned it for a replacement, just got the replacement I tried it on 3 of our DVD players our little portable one same thing. My wife loves the show so do I return it or just keep it I'll let Amazon decide."
5,Moonlight a beautiful season,"Moonlight was one of the best vampire genre shows. It was a very sad day when they did not renew it for another season. This dvd set has all 16 episodes. While this is way to few, at least we have these to remember a show many of us loved, mourned, and missed when it went off the air."
5,a great series!,I can't believe this show was cancelled after only 1 season! It's so much better than some of the related topic shows on now. I think everyone who loves Vampire shows should buy this!
5,WE CANNOT LET THAT HAPPEN!!,"This series is fabulous and the hero seems to have lept from a romance novel!! His vampire story, touching and appealing!!I am so sad for knowing they cancelled it. These producers are crazy. So many dumb series continue on the air for years and this one only lasts one season. And the heroine is very sweet as well.Let's hope the powerful men rethink about it!!"
5,Dvd Purchase,As always the purchasing process was a breeze! This seller was awesome and I would be more than happy to do business with this seller in the future. My dvd series arrived super fast and in good condition. The price was great as well!
5,Love MoonLight DVD Complete Series.,I was very upset when Moon light was taken off TV . It was one of myfavorite shows. I had taped some of them but the DVD got messed up so I was thrilled to see that Amazon.com had it. I started watching it the day it came in the mail.
5,"moonlight, awsome","I recently purchased the Moonlight,full season. I loved it. I also want to thank Amazon for making it so easy to buy and for keeping my banking info secure"
1,Moonlight,This product didn't work. I tried loading the dvd on several different dvd players with no success. Had to return my purchase.
5,Moonlight Series,This is one of my favorite tv series of all times. It is too bad it did not have a second season really. It is a good love story with a lot of mystery. And a good looking Vampire.
1,Very disappointed,"I orderered this and received it. It didn't play at all in DVD player or laptop. Got another one coming with prompt efficiency, and low and behold, didn't work again. Must be a bad batch or something. If you are going to order this, maybe wait until another batch comes in that may not be defective. Oh well, stuff happens sometimes! :-)"
5,Practical scholarship that fosters human healing,"Great. Rather than the typical pop psych or dry as dirt theory here you will find a practical approach to human/ spiritual development grounded in readable scholarship.Blends humanistic and Jungian psychology with Native American and Eastern spirituality and proposes the use of imagery (picturing/thinking via internal sensation without external input) to aid human healing. Important notions include: the need to move beyond dualistic views of the human, the need for a balanced view of humans as body-mind-spirit-emotions (and the Western neglect of emotions and spirit), the import to spiritual growth of being fully human, and the power of images to move one beyond the defenses of the conscious mind into the unconscious. Exercizes offered to practice ideas presented."
1,Elegy for Iris,Awful. Verbose. What could be said in 7 words often was written in sentences 7 lines long. Not worth reading
5,Beautiful and moving.,"John Bayley's elegy for his wife, novelist Iris Murdoch, who suffers from Alzheimer's, is magnificent. His devotion to her is in every passage of this eloquent, honest account of their more than 45 years together. As her sole caretaker now during her disease's progression, he is kind, gentle, patient, and loving, despite mistakes and moments of intense frustration and sadness. His insights into the [probable] feelings of Alzheimer's victims are perceptive and keenly felt as well, and promote a greater understanding of this insidious disease. If only everyone had a John Bayley to care for them in times of illness and distress."
4,Their best from a weak period.,"This album is the one that put Poco on the musical map. The hits were ""Crazy Love"" and ""Heart Of The Night"". But, they aren't the best songs on the album. The title track is one of the few times this band rocked and it is good. For the classic sound of Poco, listen to ""The Last Goodbye"". Overall a strong album, but, personally, I like their older stuff much better."
4,Cute Little Toy Story Alien....,Cute Little Alien... he was smaller than my son would have hoped for... but he is only 5 inches and is suppose to be smaller than Buzz and Woodie.
2,Not worth the money,"I purchased this item in order to avoid the need to be constantly tilting a regular measuring cup and skimming the fat off the top with a spoon. This cup didn't really separate the fat all that well. Factoring in the extra time it takes to clean this vs. a regular measuring cup, I don't think I gained anything. Would recommend saving your money."
4,Found it on clearance :D,"Found it on clearance in Target for only $4.98. Not sure why it was so cheap...someone must have returned it, lol."
4,An essential part of the kitchen stuff,"I have gone through dozens of fat separators over the years and this is one of the best I've found yet. I was dissapointed that it was plastic, since I had thought otherwise, but we'll see how well it holds up. All the other plastic products don't hold up well with hot fat and dishwasher cleaning."
4,Super easy gadget,Easy to use and works well. Does its task quickly with no fuss or spilling. Stopper keeps fat out of spout.
5,Get the 4-cup,"I wondered whether the 2-cup would be sufficient. Nope! First time out, the turkey juices took up nearly the whole 4-cups. Glad I didn't downsize.Works just as it should. Separation easy. Nice purchase."
5,Absolutely the best how-to for nonfiction writers,"Most how-to writing books assume you've collected everything you need to know about the subject and just need to work the passive voice out of your prose--or that you're suffering from writer's block and need to free the artist within. Blundell assumes you first have to gather information, then integrate it into a story that moves readers along. I was fortunate enough to be in his first Wall Street Journal class for new reporters. In his absence, I recommend this book to all would-be nonfiction writers"
5,Very Real and down to earth. Great Book!,This book was very real and challenges your actions and thoughts. It provokes you to move from a traditional way of thinking and has a strong Biblical viewpoint. I highly recommend the book.
2,An over-hyped CD,"I just bought this CD from Amazon.com. I must say that I am disappointed since it is claimed that ""centuries of ghazals"" were looked though before this CD was put together, sounded like a lot of effort was made to produce a very high quality CD.In reality, not quite, because:1- The listing printed on CD cover does not even indicate the names of the poets who wrote these ghazals, even a lowly cassette sold in grocery stores has the names of poets of the ghazals on it, and this is a US $15.00 CD being sold with unprecedented hype.2- The title lyric of the first ghazal is not only incorrect, but it does not make any sense as a 'misrah.'3- The sequnce of the sung 'ashaars' of the first ghazal does not match the sequence maintained by the ghazal writer, as published in his book. So much about the title ghazal of this CD. I could not listen any further than the title ghazal."
4,A Good Basic Watch,Pros: Price; Easy to read; Stays dry in the showerCons: Dial size is a little small; Wrist band is a little short
4,very small,"This watch does the trick, but it's real small. I've a guy with very small hands, sometimes I pull off unisex watches, and even on me this thing is small. It's also impossible to read in the dark. That said, it's quite comfortable and thin and unobtrusive, I've successfully swam in it, and so far no failures yet."
5,solid performer,This watch is just what it apears to be - a no frills time keeper and that's just what I was looking for.
2,Strap too short for Big Guys.,We liked everything about this.....but the strap. The last notch fit him but there was no way to secure the strap.5 stars for Amazons return policy.
4,Nice card for a person on a budget,"I purchased this in April 07 and found it to be very easy to install and to date I have had no problem at all with it. My wife and I move about every 13 weeks and even with that it has never needed to be reseated or anything. The only issue was remembering I had it and accidently plugging my monitor into the wrong place, which is hardly a fault of the card! :)Anyway, if you're looking for a card that is a cut above the standard OEM for most PC's but don't want to break the bank then I would recommend this card. If you want jaw dropping performance then spend a little more for the big boys."
4,Stedman's Abbreviation book,"This book is an excellent resource if you review medical record documentation for any reason. I use it all the time as a nurse and a coding/compliance auditor. Everyone in my department has their own copy. It is a necessary tool in the industry.Overall, I find Stedmans's is the best abbreviation book available. It is comprehensive and is easy to use. It gives multiple listings for each abbrevation. Don't struggle trying to read charts, buy yourself a copy!"
3,ferret carry sack,"I like the way the bag closes with the velcro, but it is a little small and my ferrets can get out of the top."
3,Another Steven Seagal...,"Hey, for utter and complete mind candification, this book is a fun read. Unfortunately that's it. This guy is another Steven Seagal...a man prone to believing his own exagerations, who seeks the company of media-types to spread his lies, and who actually expects folks to believe him. Unfortunately, just like Seagal's movies, folks will go see his movies just for the fun of it...not to see some half-wit's (Vandenberg) version of the truth. Enjoy the book and lose respect for Leonardo DiCaprio and Martin Scorsese along the way!Oh, one more thing...there is no such thing as ""Kunto"" Karate."
3,yawn,I love Agatha Raisin. I think that the first three books in this series are remarkably well done. But maybe I read the first five books too quickly and this is one just became glaringly the same as the others. Instead of growing as a character Agatha is becoming a stereotype. Not only that but the other once glorious town folk are becoming more backdrops. Backdrops to what is another question... for what made the first few books great were not the mysteries but the characters themselves. Now it seems that Beaton is trying to force Raisin into the land of James Bond and spy craft.I will just put it that I was pretty disappointed by this book and feel like the three star review might be a little generous on my part. Only the fact that Beaton wrote such brilliant books (that are mocked here) lends itself to garnering a higher review in my book.
2,Works great for five minutes.,"I thought it would be a neat idea to hang christmas lights around my room. I had a set of 100 lights and used about ten or so clips to keep them hanging. As I was hanging them up there, some kept falling off so I put a new sticky on the back to make it work again. After awhile I got them all up there and it looked wonderful. The concept of these clips is great! However, the adhesive is not strong enough. May work for small projects but as much as I tried keeping them up there, I gave up. Very scary when they fall down while you're sleeping. Will be returning these back."
1,Not for Christmas lights,"Needed something to use to hang Christmas lights on the window in our apartment. Saw these, read the description, looked at an example photo and thought they'd be perfect. When they came in, we followed all the instructions for hanging them, cleaning the area with rubbing alcohol, waiting until that was dry before putting them up and then waiting an hour to start hanging the lights. Within 30 minutes of putting them up, the whole top row fell down. Tried again, same deal. In the end, we cut slabs of packing tape, placed them over the hooks and cut through the tape where the hook is to put the light strand in and that held (for the most part).Maybe it's because we were using these on windows, but the directions never said it wasn't for use on windows so I didn't imagine it wouldn't work. I was very disappointed with this product."
3,Love Command Strips!,"I love Command Strips, I needed some to hand a banner from my mantle so I wanted the smaller clear ones. I wish Amazon had included more details about this item because what I received is NOT what was pictured. The picture shows clear tabs, and the size that hold a 1/2 pound. What arrived what white, and smaller than the image. These hooks are TINY, you can hang a necklace but that is about it. I would say they are about 1/2 inch tall, the command strip goes sideways to hold them so it can be a little awkward depending on your space. amazon offered to let me return them but I kept them because they will work for hanging costume jewelry in my closet. So -2 stars for the sizing issues and Amazon being unclear."
3,Replacement glass worked well,"...until I dropped it and it broke. So, I had to go the route of purchasing another replacment. I was happy to find that Bodum makes a French press that is shatterproof, so I purchased that one instead."
3,A warning to buyers!,"Years ago I saw this movie, A Canterbury Tale, and liked it. I bought the DVD version with great enthusiasm. When I tried to watch it, I discovered that it was encoded for Region 2 (that is, Europe) and could not be played on U.S. players. Because I had opened the container, the DVD was not returnable. If you have only a Region 1 player, check Product Information carefully before you order A Canterbury Tale!"
5,Actually...4.5 stars,"I LOVE this bed and so does my dog! It was a great size and came in a VERY timely manner(standard shipping) Im very happy with it and my dog LOVES it. Theonly thing was it was in a plastic bag that was tied really tight and that dispaced the filling. When i tried to fluff it up and it worked some what. I think the only thing i would improve is putting a little more filling inside the bed, other than that its great!! I would say that its big enofe for dog up to about 70 lbs ( MEDIUM TO MEDIUM LARGE)"
4,dog bed,"I love the bed, so does the dog, but it didn't come in blue as I had ordered, it is black. And, the poly fill is slippery under a large dog's feet (under mine, as well), so watch out! At first he had to be coaxed back on, after losing his footing. Now he is more careful. The cover is easy on and off for washing. Overall a very good product."
5,a bit expensive but well worth it,"I am very pleased with this pet bed for my dog. I could have gone down a size I think, my almost a year old ""puppy"" weighs 40 lbs. and she has room to grow. I love the look of the bed. I ordered Khaki and it looks nice with the cream color top, it's not the first thing you see when you walk into the room! It's very comfortable, she started using it immediately. She's given it a few good shakes being the puppy that she is, no tears or holes. I looked at many similar products but I am a review kind of girl and this was the best. I agree. I'm glad I did my research! I would absolutely recommend this product."
4,Great Go To book for feeding my family,"I really like that the author is a cook AND cooks for small kids. There are things in this book that are just vegan versions of very normal everyday food. So many books have fancy stuff that restaurants have and my ""meat and potatoes"" omnivore hubby and my ""only eats mashed potatoes and buttered noodles"" semi-vegan 4 year old like plain food that is good. This book fits that description. It's food like what I grew up with, but ""vegan-ized."" Oh, his quick and easy home made pizza sauce and spaghetti sauces are both super yummy! We have been making pizza every Saturday using his sauce and crust recipe. Plus, I love that he has a lot of easy desserts. I kept checking this out from the library and they kept wanting it back, so I finally had to buy it. I'm glad I did. I didn't do 5 stars because sometimes a recipe will forget to mention something (like flour for the gingerbread cookies and I had to guess how much!), but generally, they are all really good."
2,Missing Chantay Savage!,"The soundtrack is OK, but is MISSING the BEST song in the movie - the HOUSE MIX of CHANTAY SAVAGE's amazing Chicago-style house anthem IF YOU BELIEVE - produced by STEVE SILK HURLEY and REMIXED by E-SMOOVE - oh well, search out the 12"" for the full 13-minute opus!"
1,Inappropriate content for a children's book,"Someone gave this to our three year old and when I sat down to read it, I was quickly forced to make up a new story in lieu of reading ""he picks out his victim"" and ""his teeth bite and slice"" ...I understand that animals kill other animals for food, but I don't really understand why I would want to expose my child to aggressive descriptions of animals preying on other animals.If you are training your child to be a young street fighter, this might be a good primer."
3,Kinda a Disappointment.....,"This Ultra Trance 6 cd is NOT like any other Ultra Trance cd. If you are looking for something a little different and new, then you might care for this more than I did. But if you love the traditional Ultra Trance cds and expect to get the same thing, then I recommend that you listen to the cd BEFORE you buy it. Some tracks are put together really well, but there might not be enough of them to get the cd. There is much better trance out there."
2,Don't buy it.,"The art works were hard to read and the contents were repetive. There's no point of reading this when the servitor kept repeating what's he was saying. ""I am the God Machine."" ""I fear nothing."" ""Fire."" 'the end' and so on...Don't buy this book unlast you are soooo deseparate to about warhammer 40k's art work. Save up your money to buy warhammer 40k instead"
4,Philosophy Hope in a Jar,"This moisturizer is great, but Philosophy's delivery was changed a number of times. The service department was non responsive. In the future I will order through QVC."
3,What is that smell...,"At first I quite liked this product as it was recommended to me by a couple different friends, so I went out and purchased it. I didn't really feel the difference, but I only used it for a couple of weeks as it started to smell very medicinal (in a bad way) and I couldn't stand it."
3,beeps,"The pump works really well and was a lifesaver the first week after my daughter was born. It is super easy to put together, to use, and to clean. It IS loud (dont think you'll be discreet using this at work or when guests are over, you can hear mine loud and clear from two floors away) but the noise of the pump isn't really annoying. What IS irritating is the fact that the machine BEEPS, loudly, on every pump, so the whole time you're pumping you hear ""beep-beep, beep-beep,beep-beep"". And if you increase the speed of the pump, it beeps even faster. If obnoxious, high-pitched, repetitive and loud noises bother you, dont get this pump. Otherwise, it works really well and is a great price, and very sanitary. The noise is really a shame, because otherwise I like it."
5,2nd time Mom,"I knew I was going to breast feed while on maternity leave, and go as long as I could after returning to work. So I knew I was going to need a pump for work. With my first child, I rented the Hospital one, and lugged that beast to and fro work. I finally got sick of how big it was and quit nursing/pumping after a month. Since I knew this was my last child, I didn't want to spend out a lot of money for a $2-300 pump. After reading these reviews, I had to try this one for the $. I am sure glad I did. After my son was born, we had latching issues, so I decided to pump 100%, and bottle feed. This is my ninth week of using the pump, I pump 5-6 times a day for about 15 minutes each time, and it still works as good as the first day. It is a little louder, but for the price I can live with it. The caps are hard to snap off the flanges, but once again, for this price, it's worth the elbow grease."
1,Do not waste your money on this pump,"I do not usually write reviews, but I felt it was important to write this one.Please do not waste your money on this pump!!!! If you pump occasionaly this pump might work for you, but if you have to go back to work and pump on a regular basis, this pump is a total waste of your money. It does not have a good suction and it is very poorly designed. I had to request a replacement of my pump first week I started using it daily. The new pump they sent still does not work well and the suction is very bad. Just like everyone else I read the reviews and I could not afford a $300 Medela pump so I bought this one. After dealing with this terribile pump for 3 months, I now realize that it is so worth spending the money and purchasing either a Medela or Ameda pump that ALL lactation specialists recommend. Please do not make the same mistake! You will pay twice!!"
4,Don't buy used--you risk HIV and Hep-B!,"I purchased the Pump in Style used. I opened up the pump to clean the diaphragm and found it covered in mold! Then I did my research; google ""FDA breast pump"" and you'll find the FDA's website. It turns out all consumer breast pumps are open systems. The Lansinoh pump is an open system, too. The milk actually aspirates and travels through the tubing to the pump. According to the FDA, HIV and Hepatitis can be transmitted from one breastpump user to the next! Thankfully, I found out about this before using my pump. However, you CAN buy used pumps if they are hospital grade (e.g., Medela Lactina or Symphony). They are closed systems and perfectly safe for multiple users. I bought a Lactina off Craig's List and I love it. Good luck, and don't give up on breastfeeding! It's worth it for your baby!"
4,Freedom Downtime,"Ever see the ""FREE KEVIN"" stickers on random phone booths in NYC? the ""KEVIN"" the stickers advertise is Kevin Mitnick, the brilliant hacker (no, not like the movie ""HACKERS"" although most definitely an inspiration for it) who was put behind bars for a long time for ""crimes."" Um, funny how only 15 yrs ago you could blow a 2600 hz tone into a pay phone with a cracker jack whistle and hack it, even though everything was supposedly ""secure."" same thing, only now we're dealing with websites and logic...."
4,Movie before my time...,"So I am reviewing this as a music lover. I grew up with this album . It was in my mothers collection. Of all the records my mom had, this was in the top 3 most listened to by my siblings and I. I don't remember all the songs, but I remember I thoroughly enjoyed most of them, and I'm sure if I heard them again I would enjoy them even more. I miss it."
2,I'm going to save you sixteen to twenty dollars,"This book presents a great idea, but it can be summed up in nine words: cut, fold and glue attractive papers to make envelopes. The rest of the book is fluff. With this caution, buy the book only if you believe that 3 pieces of traslucent plastic cut in the size and shape of unfolded envelopes, the ""templates,"" are worth the money."
1,Super underwhelming,"I thought this book would be great for a friend for generating cool ideas. Instead it was about the most basic how-to ever, with few examples for inspiration. I was really disappointed by the book. Absolutely not worth purchasing, especially for the crazy high new book prices. (The used prices would be reasonable if the book was good, or even somewhat long, but its not. Save your dollars and find a different book.)"
3,A bit basic,"This is an ok book. If you have envelope templates already then I'd say pass on this book because the text isn't that novel. There just isn't much to it......select a page from a magazine, plop the template down, draw around the shape of the template, cut it out and glue it up. Voila. I'm actually surprised the author was able to turn this topic into a book. It does have a few unique ideas like using special scissors like the deckle edge to cut out the envelope shape. It might be a good book for someone just starting to play around with templates and making envelopes. I was just looking for something for more advanced mail art."
1,bad customer service,"I still have not received this item , I have called and emailed and no response, I hope they are out of business for good. There service is so bad. I would have been nice to let me know or cancel my order outright so I don't have to wait a month to order it from someone else. I seem not be able to cancel until the 17th of may. thanks for bad customer service."
4,"Winner, winner, chicken dinner","I really enjoyed this movie. I had zero expectations heading into it, and only after I started watching it did I realise it was based, loosely, on the book Bringing Down the House. I'd thoroughly enjoyed the book, and found the movie entertaining. Students head to Vegas and count cards with their professor and discover a completely new life. It reminded me in parts of ""Rounders"" meets ""Good Will Hunting"". I was inspired to go to gamble in Vegas - possibly not the best take-home message, but since Vegas is so far away, one that I can live with."
3,Here's to the nerds,"I enjoyed this flick mostly because it reminded me that some MIT kids actually took Las Vegas for a lot of money. And I kept tninking, ""why is card-counting not allowed?"" I know the casinos are permitted to eject those who do it, but why can't the ejectees sue the casinos for illegal discrimination against people using their brains. But I suppose if it were allowed, the casinos would drop 21 from their menu of games if they lost their advantage.As far as the movie goes, it appeared that the kids needed to vary their signals a bit and otherwise avoid providing the same patterns to the surveillance team. And I wondered why they didn't visit Reno and Atlantic City."
3,"If you like this movie, get it on HD","The movie didn't work for me. Overdone glorified Vegas blackjack story and watching the trailer is good enough if you are interested in the story.One element I liked about the movie is the Vegas scenes they showed off. The suites, strip view, casinos, clubs looked beautiful on HD."
1,Dumbed down,"What happened with this movie is, they took a story that originated in the real world that was highly fascinating, and dumbed it down to a formulaic movie that is utterly predictable and just plain boring.If they had stuck with more genuine material, the story would be more interesting. The movie is a disservice to the players in the actual events."
2,Predictable and boring really,This could have had so much more but poor boy wants to have enough money to go to medical school. Has an aptitude for counting cards. You can fill in the rest. Its predictable and not very exciting.
2,Good Will Hunting can be Jason Bourne...,"... if MIT nerds can break the casino. The story is so fake. I grew up hanging out at MIT since high school. Went to the ""other"" school in Cambridge having realized the MIT experience was completely detached from the real world. I am familiar with some of the members of the card-counting team. They had a pack not to talk about their losses, for good reasons. The casinos found their income at the poker tables increased about 10 times, after the ""rumor"" was spread that MIT students won money from them. Of course, the casinos did not bother to refute their claims.What type of people run casinos? Certainly not stupid or charitable people. It is a complete fantasy to think some book-smart kids can take money from street-smart operators at their home court.Maybe Jason Bourne actually did graduate from MIT?"
4,"Good Movie, kept me guessing the ending.","I thought this was a great movie. Not sure if I would buy it, but would rent again. Shocking ending, decent cast and every few minutes something unexpected happened."
3,Doesn't seem to fit the Killerspin Rubber Protector,"This is an okay table tennis cover. If you bought this with the Killerspin Rubber protector and you don't want to trim it to the exact shape of your paddle, it will need to be folded at the corners to fit in this cover. I only use it for one paddle but it should fit two albeit snuggly. I think I would go for a more rectangular design in the future. That said, this cover is well built and the unusual shape seems pretty trendy."
5,Nice Bag- Lots of space- Holds 2 rackets,"I like this bag. It's very spacious inside, lightweight and can hold 2 paddles on either side.It has an elastic band that keeps the paddle secured and prevents them from falling out when you unzip it and also pockets on the side for balls & other accessories.Good quality. It reminds me of an extra, extra large taco."
2,Not a Good Buy,"This is an unreliable and soon to be discontinued router. Mine worked well for 5-6 months then died. Ironically, it was a factory replacement for an original SpeedStream router that died after only 4 months. SpeedStream is getting out of the router business, so beware of buying this soon-to-be-orphaned device."
1,Crappy product,"I had a different SpeedStream router for about 10 months when it crapped out on me. I sent it in to the manufacturer and about a month later they sent me the Powerline version of their product. I had a lot of trouble setting it up and since their tech support is only open from 7 to 7, I waited a long time to be able to call them for help. Just yesterday, after three months with this new router, the wireless capabilities stopped functioning. Of course, I had to go into work late so I could call their tech support to find this out. So my router is now worthless to me. Luckily it has been 13 months since the purchase date and my warranty is kaput. So I am now in the market for a new router. I guarantee I will never by another SpeedStream product. Crap Crap Crap!"
5,finally someone who kicks ...,"it's been very rare in the past 10 or so years that a band really rock me - these guys do itto me, it sounds like a combination of the post punk of bauhaus, killing joke, wire, gang of four with the assault and thickness of melvins, early nirvana and shellacches smith's drumming crushesalex newport's guitar playing switches back and forth between minimal dissonant antifunk and pure metallic sludge while his vocals make me think maybe this is what robert smith would sound like if he had ballsbuy this - you won't be disappointedand if you ever get the chance, see them liveand don't forget your earplugs"
4,A great family movie.,I am very pleased with the purchase.It was not quite as good as the first two movies but it was still a very good family movie.I would recommend it to all generations.
2,Consistently bad sectors,I am able to burn the whole thing with Toast7 on a Pioneer DVR-110D but verification always fails with it seems the same bad sector. Bad batch?
1,Bad Product,"Horrible !Terrible !Pitiful !Trash !Junk !If only I had listened to the other reviewers and stayed away from this product. But NOOOOOOOOOOOO. I was stupid. So don't be like me. I could have saved myself a lot of time, effort, headaches and MONEY. I promise you this, you will have a lot of problems with these disc.I have a Sony DVD recorder RDR-GX330 and it does not recognize any of these disc. Period. First 4 disc out of the box would not format. Threw the rest of the package of disc in the trash. And since these are DL disc, I cannot use them anywhere else unless I have another dual layer recorder. I don't.Memorex ought to be ashamed of themselves to put out a consistently flawed product like this. Looks to me like their quality control department was on vacation, if it existed at all."
3,"Very professional pep's and ""Kool as Cactus""","Great instructional video, I was a key part in putting this instructional video together and was Director of Photography on this shoot, ""Strictly Beach"" with Karch Kiraly and Karolyn Kirby. Very professional pep's and ""Kool as Cactus""-Alexis Cottavoz"
5,The wheel rules a musical world gone horribly wrong,"Davie Quinn is that rare breed of rock and roller who forgoes flare and fashion for 1000 octane hyperfuel aimed directly at your bowels. If speed and anger and poetry for the working class soul is your rant and want, then Tiltwheel is just the band to kick you firmly in the seat of your pants and leave your crosseyed in the mosh pit."
4,kburns,"I had bought this camera at sears a few years ago. it works pretty good, i have never had a problem with weird noise, or bad picture or anything, the only bummer is if you want a camera that is easy to be able to transfer your video to disk, then this is not the camera for you, but if you prefer tapes its pretty good, and you can get the tapes from wal-mart, so all in all its a fairly good camera."
3,What's the point?,"While an interesting genre exercise, plot got lost somewhere between weird concept, casting and stilted dialogue. Not sure how 'realistic' this is. It's set in the mid-70s, based on the cars, not the early '60s, as some have incorrectly posited. At least it's short."
2,"overblown and overrated, don't believe the hype!","I sit here with mouth agape as I read prior reviews of this ridiculously shallow one-track mind trash. The director, who also did the yawnfest, Barcelona, has absolutely no sense of flow or wit. And yet critics seem to gravitate towards this nonsense. If this type of casual diatribe is what you dig, then try the Merchant-Ivory claptrap which at least contributes some costume design. Or better yet, see Campbell Scott and Jennifer Jason-Leigh in the Dorothy Parker film. At least you will laugh. Nothing funny here, and nothing interesting for that matter. All you are subjected to is soap-operish musings about class and a kindergarten philosophy that grows stale with 5 minutes of alertness. I really wanted to try to find something positive about this film. Even the self conscious rantings were stilted with apologies. I can't see how anyone could take stuff like this even remotely seriously. Don't fall into the trap and don't believe the hype!"
4,coming of age for Manhattan upper middles,"I got an urge to get Mansfield Park about half way through thisfilm. What struck me was hearing a clearly snobbish upper middle girl saying she didn't like snobs: that kind of thing makes it a comedy.The two guys who become friends at the end because they sharea love for the same really nice girl is touching and funny.A manners comedy set in a relatively modern 70's or 80'sManhattan among college students that shows that the more things change, the more they remain the same?"
2,Not so great,"These nails are too weak to be useful for Hardie siding jobs. They will bend and collapse often when they encounter harder areas such as knots or older lumber. They actually bend back upon themselves forming a complete 180 degree bend. They especially collapse when passing through 2 layers of Hardie material such as installing the Hardie trim.I found that having a Bostich Stick Nailer with 2"" nails handy and a pair of pliers to remove the bent coil nails will make the job go faster."
2,Dumbed down version of MySQL documentation.,"I bought this book with the hope to get deep insights into the workings of MySQL on windows platform, including issues like perfromance tuning on windows platform etc. But the book was a big disappointment. It is a dumbed down version of the MySQL documentation, for users who don't have any prior database experience. If you have already worked with database and want to learn about MySQL, you are better off reading the free online docmentation."
4,Inspirational (if not earth-shattering),"The audio of this book is the way to go: For some reason it's not a book that is nearly as interesting to read as to hear. It's valuable material, although much of it you may already know. Still, his good reminders, plus his interesting twists on how to live life each day make this is good purchase."
5,I worship Strata,"These songs are amazing, most especially ""Night Falls"" and ""Coma Therapy"". I think Eric Vittorino is a genius. Anyways, this CD has made me very happy. I found some excerpts from his book at his MySpace and I'm thinking about getting that as well. He goes into some detail about the motivation behind some of the songs on this album. His notes on ""Poughkeepsie New York"" should be noted, because the story behind it is quite unique.Sorry to sound like such a rabid fan, but in my opinion if you buy this CD you won't be disappointed."
3,O....K.....,"Well, i find that this movie could have been about a half hour long in total. Within the first 20 minutes this film got real old. I love erotic thriller type movies; however, i demand more intensity out of film of that nature. Still, despite all of that i did enjoy watching it...once...and i will probably never watch it again."
2,Actresses MUST have something better to do...,"Not as violent as I feared it might be, nor quite as pornographic --- I was prepared to be unable to finish it --- the movie was, nonetheless, unnecessarily graphic. The sex was real but the male members were limp, so perhaps that makes it OK. I don't know. Given what the movie sets out to do, it was well done. Still, these actresses really must have something better to do. Don't waste your money --- if you want pornography this won't do it for you, and if you don't want pornography, it still won't do it for you."
1,France's Answer to Thelma and Louise?,"We've all heard the hype about how ""graphic"" and ""real"" this film is. In truth, this film is a low-budget, D-grade foreign film that steals an idea from an American film and gives it that supposed ""edge."" Let's face it, the only reason this film got so much press was because you can actually see penetration in the rape scenes, something that was previously taboo in film. Even this is tainted by the unreal use of condoms by the rapists. They actually stop, put on their condoms, and then get to work. The actresses are two low-grade porn stars. Overall, this film is a cheap immitation that uses shock to get noticed. Don't waste your money! If you want shocking and disturbing, along with good acting and realism, shell out the money for a copy of Salo."
3,Okay,"I love the show divine design, however there could have been more pictures and a lot less wording in this book. Maybe her next book could be a compilation of all of the rooms that she decorated on her show."
4,Super Design That's Divine,"The WOW effect! This book contains beautiful rooms decorated by Candice Olson. Nice photos of episodes from her HGTV show. Not sure it will ""help"" me in decorating my home. I wish there were descriptions of paint colors and products used etc."
1,Incomplete delivery,"The item received was for a Christmas gift.It was too small and was returned for exchange using the emailed return form.As of 2-19-08, I still have not received the item.The charge was made immediately to my charge cardin early December.So what do I do next?HELP."
5,Quaint and funny.,"Lizzie Bingman is a girl of the 21st century - strong, confidant, courageous, outgoing. The only trouble is that she's in the early 1900's, a time when women were fighting for equal rights. Her fiascoes are hilarious, and one can greatly empathize with her situation. I strongly recommend this book to anyone with a sense of humor!"
1,Broken after a few uses,"I purchased this mat in February 2012 to use for rolling fondant. I enjoy making cakes for family and friends and am by no means a professional. After about 5 or 6 uses the mat developed a split in one side probably due to the weight of the mat itself. It is very heavy and unwieldy when trying to use it to help get the fondant on the cake. Washing and drying it are also a pain. I did have it stick to the fondant several times as well. Within the next two uses the split in the side spread to the middle of the mat, making it pretty much useless. Maybe I can cut it down and use it for smaller cakes or something but for the price I am very disappointed in the product."
3,Breaks,This mat works great but while I was cleaning up I folded the mat in half twice thinking nothing of it because it's silicone so I figured it'd flexible. It cracked in half. Just split right down the middle. I had to cut the ends and now have 2 mats:( so never fold these. Only roll them up
1,Bad item,"Boy do they lie when they tell you fondant and other stuff does not stick to this. It does. I madea large bit of fondant and it stuck so badly, it messed the whole piece up. Also I rolled outpie crust and had the same awful time with that too. Stuck badly. I get better results with storeshopping plastic bags. I cut them open and lay them on a wet counter to make them stick &not move. Then I place one on top of crust or fondant and use a rolling pin. It comes outbeautifully. I will stick with plastic bags in the future. Waste of money."
3,o man,i didnt know that the two books in this book were related now i will have to read them both again yea...
1,Worst sound quality ever,"This phone is the coolest phone - it has all the bells and whistles you could possibly want. Polyphonic ring tones, speakerphone, 50 number storage phone book, expandable system up to 8 phones. I would have LOVED this phone had it not been for one crucial detail. The sound quality was horrible. There was constant static, and everyone's voices had an electronic ""echo"". Additionally, the phone seemed to cut off the last syllable of every other word or so, making it impossible to have an intelligent conversation. Everyone I talked to got sick of hearing me say, ""Huh? What did you say?"" and begged me to get another phone. I even exchanged the first one, thinking I had gotten a bad apple, but sure enough, the second time around was the same story. I returned this phone today. Motorola, listen up, awesome features, but when it comes down to it, they mean nothing if you cannot use the phone for what it was made for - conversing."
1,Big dissappointment,"I wanted to love this phone... it looked great and had many slick features such as turning the ring down in the evening and custom rings for known callers. But, static, crackle, and a very short range make this phone virtually unusable. I had bought a base and 2 extension phones. These phones were expensive and would have been worth it if they worked as advertised. But, sound quality is a joke. Thank goodness I kept the receipts. I used to think that the Motorola name meant quality when it came to communication equipment. Obviously, they're not above using their name to soak you on a half baked product now and then. I can't wait to take them back... When the manager asks, ""Why are you returning them?"" I'm going to ask, ""Why are you selling them?"""
4,Phone Book,"FYI: The MD761, similar model with built-in answering machine, has an additional 48 entry phone book stored in the base that is shared with all the handsets. I do not currently own either of these phones, but am ordering an MD761 for myself. I do not know if I'll use the answering machine, but for ~$10 more I'd like to get the shared address book."
4,almost perfect,"Such a terrific reference work! But with so many terrific random digits, it's a shame they didn't sort them, to make it easier to find the one you're looking for."
1,Sloppy.,"The book is a promising reference concept, but the execution is somewhat sloppy. Whatever generator they used was not fully tested. The bulk of each page seems random enough. However at the lower left and lower right of alternate pages, the number is found to increment directly."
3,A serious reference work?,For a supposedly serious reference work the omission of an index is a major impediment. I hope this will be corrected in the next edition.
3,I smell a conspiracy,"How is it that the RAND corporation has a monopoly on RAND-om numbers? I think these numbers aren't truly mathematically random, but rather were designed so that, when used in research, they will produce results that will control our minds. Just one more justification for the aluminum hat I always wear."
2,Could be more random?,"I'm no number expert, but I can't help wondering if these digits could be more random. Every line is set using tabular, lining numerals which to me lack a certain spontaneity. And the monotonous use of 11 point Courier also seems like a missed opportunity. Again I only observe numbers casually, but while these digits appear moderately inconsistent, I hope to see more randomness from the publisher in future editions."
4,"Great, but 2 much pr0n","Really, really great, but with far too little pr0n, frankly. I mean, if we're being frank. If we're being candid."
2,i don't understand,"i'm not from your country plus i'm not the smartest whip this side of the equator but this book both confused and boggled me. i really didn't get it. i kept trying to find a pattern, any pattern, within its pages but i came up stone cold empty. someone please enlighten me before i contact the UN or drink myself silly with absinthe."
3,"I guess its ok, but its nothing in comparison to Graham's Digit's Bound...","This book is ok as far as lists of digits go, but seriously limited. Its only a million digits. Its nothing in comparison to Graham's Digit's Bound (available from Cirius Cybernetics as the ratio of lengths of two pieces of bogonium, or as an RSS feed until the end of this and every universe.)To be fair this set of digits is supposed to be random, but my guess is that you could find this exact set of digits or an encoding of this set as a set of digits in Graham's Digit's Bound. I could easily prove this if I could get a couple of minutes of time on the Aleph One. (A well known Matrioshka Brain a little of the left of our SBbc.)As you can see......2464195387There!"
5,Deeply Archetypal,"Consciously or unconsciously, we are always meaning to bring our own meaning to the books we read, and this book gives new meaning to the meaning of meaning. Who has not read this book a dozen times and not found, each new time, some new clue to one's own story--a forgotten credit card number, a school board election tally? Everything is there in dizzying detail. The mists that shroud old memories evaporate, page by page."
3,It left me wanting more...,...does anyone know when they are planning to publish a sequel? I can't stand the fact that it feels so unfinished!
2,Who didn't see that one coming?,"It was necessary for me to give this book only two stars. This was a nice enough story. However, the author really needed a twist at the end. I could tell halfway through the book where the story was headed. For the people surprised by the ending, you all must be living in caves...on Mars! This book has been around for sixty years! Everyone knows before the opening credits the Titanic sinks at the end and ""Rosebud"" is the sleigh. Who didn't foresee the 22120 12518 did it. I hope this has been a learning experience for up and coming authors. Put some effort into the ending of your book."
3,"Book was good, movie was better","The book was okay, but the movie was definitely better. I thought the movie rating should have been hire based upon some of the places they were graphically sticking their digits."
5,The Battle To Fulfill Your Destiny in God,"The Battle To Fulfill Your Destiny in God was ""life-changing"" for me. Everyone asks the question at some point in their life ""Why Am I Here?"" After reading this book, they will surely know the answer. Easy to read - powerful -and you cannot miss the message that comes through ... it's very clear . I thank God this book found its way intomy life ... and thank you Juanita Folsom and Timothy Williams for obeying God to put into words what He laid upon your hearts!!"
5,"Sure it's random, but ...","Shouldn't this book be on the list of things banned for export from the US? We can't have our random digits, and especially our treasured 100,000 normal deviates, being used by countries unfriendly to the US!By the way, I wonder if these normal deviates have all registered with their local or state law enforcement agencies? I guess that Rand doesn't care about really twisted deviates, just the normal ones. Obviously, they don't spend much time on MySpace."
1,A Hollow Feeling,"Most of the characters were lifeless and the plot non existent. Hopefully the sequel will be better, I do want to know what happens to Warren."
1,Predictable,"If you expected this book to harness the power of any surprise simply because of the term ""random"" in its title, you'd be sorely dissapointed. Not only is the plot hackneyed and the characters underdeveloped, but any reader with a fourth grade education can see the unfolding of each twist and turn miles before the author reaches it.The story drags on as the reader anticipates each and every supposed surprise. This book is about as random as flipping a coin. To summarize my thoughts on this book, a quote from my six year old daughter fits best:""Daddy, I didn't like it. The results in this [book] do not tell us anything about transposed digits or other self-canceling errors.""She was nearly in tears."
1,A little effort please!,RAND - Would it kill you to run spellcheck? What's it take - about two seconds... Your tax dollars at work
2,Not as good as I expected,"These candies were just mediocre in flavor. When you first put them in your mouth, they taste bitter and powdery but as you chew, the flavor does improve a bit. I don't really recommend them."
5,naval cufflinks,These were a gift for my nephew who is a captain in the Navy. To me they werre especially perfect because they would go with yellow or white gold. He wore them to an event and likes them too.
2,very disappointing,"I ordered this as an add-on to a book by another author, based on the old ""people who bought this book also bought...."" teaser. I am frankly amazed that it has any positive reviews at all; To prevent hard feelings, let's just say I'm mystified.As to my complaints, the author is repetitive to a fault, which is amazing in a volume which barely stretches to 100 pages. There are some horrible grammatical errors, which left me wondering if anyone proofread the text. Finally, there's just not anything new here. Not even a thoughtful synthesis of other ideas into a unifying theme. Most any Bhuddist or Taoist text would give one far more insight to the subject matter. As more than one teacher has commented when a student tries to stretch a paper, ""long on words, short on thought.""In short, a good, solid 5th-grade level intro to very basic concepts."
5,Excellent book.,"This book is awsome! This book is for someone that has a strong C++ background but does not have to have experience with the windows api in order to begin programming on a CE box. If you know the windows API a lot of this book might be review. The book also does not go into a lot of depth about the architecture of windows CE. It also only skims over sections about bluetooth, smartphone, pocket pc and other technologies that you may want to use on your ce box. Along with this book you will probably want a reference book specifically on Embeded studio and on whichever technologies you are using. For the price and the coverage this cant be beat."
5,"""Delightful Read""","This is a hot, steamy, and loving story with a unique twist. I found the hero, Nicholas and heroine, Merry to be very likable characters. I especially enjoyed the story because Nic and Merry were able to spend time alone throughout the entire story, so their getting to know each other and falling madly in love was quite believable. The plot is great and there was not a dull moment. I read it cover to cover non stop. Oh yeah, there is this sex scene towards the end that was so intense I had to read it over repeatedly."
3,It was okay,I really wanted to like this book but I thought it was just okay. I thought it was too short. I liked the hero and the heroine but their story could have been a lot longer. I wanted to read more about their lives.
2,Disappointing,"I bought this book on the strength of the reviews written here. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. I thought the characters were stiff and the plot did not capture my interest. It was rather transparent and didn't hold any surprises (Nicolas has a son he's never seen and suddenly a well-spoken servant boy shows up. Gee - wonder who he could be?) Truth be told, I haven't even finished the book. I put it down several weeks ago and haven't bothered to pick it back up again. I didn't even make it as far as the sex scenes because I was already too turned off."
2,So-so,"I think that my biggest pet peeve about this the usage of names that were familiar to me already. Craven reminded me of Lisa Kleypas' Dreaming of You, The Duke of Monmouth made me think of Suzanne Enoch's Reforming a Rake and Althorp reminded me of the estate where Princess Diana was buried. Despite all these flashbacks and needs to re-read other books least the plot was orginal and written in good taste."
4,Great!!!,"I really liked this 3 short stories, all are great but my favourite is Magnetic Rose, If you like watching anime, you should watch this and enjoy the very best."
5,Magnetic Rose... It's amazing,"5 stars! and that's just for Magnetic Rose, the first of three stories told in Memories. With three different directors all putting their own specialities into Otomo's work, it creates an amazing and diverse experience in watching.They are put in an order that i found to be the order in which i liked them. I was blown away by Magnetic Rose, so just buy this set and watch them."
1,"Disappointed with product, while picture has been drastically altered","I thought the picture looked awesome and was excited to purchase this for my husband. When I received the item, it looked NOTHING like the picture!!! Once received, it was a light grey instead of black with the lighting bolts at a sky blue instead of deep blue."
4,Great deal on a DV,I got this DV Camera to tape some old Super-8 movies for conversion to DVD. Thanks to the low light performance and image stabiliaztion it did a great job. Then I shot some footage on the Santa Monica Pier and it did great in daylight as well. So for a low cost video camera you can't beat it. It's not a digital camera though go buy one if you want that. Still no firewire cable was a let down but you can get them cheap look for a 4-6 pin cable and get it hooked up for computer fun!
3,Minty,I am disappointed in this item. It only gives you a cool feeling. I have not seen any plumping what so ever. I have tried it 4 or 5 times and it is always the same cool feeling. And it goes on sticky.
3,"O.K. visuals, story a little lacking","This TBP is the second in the Tales of the Jedi story, if you are going chronologically in star wars time. It takes place a 1,000 years before the original Tales of the Jedi, and takes place a week or so after ""Golden Age of the Sith"". Out of the ""TOTJ"" series, it is one of the worst, but still better than most of the TBP's out there. I reccommend it for people trying to complete their TOTJ collection, not for a stand-alone read."
2,Now we take we back to ancient egypt...,"This is the conclusion of the Golden Age of the Sith. The Fall is also set 5,000 years before NEW HOPE. While the art work also improves, yes I said improves, the story seems to disintegrate into itself. Since I like some of KJA's work, I am assuming that he was not the lead writer, just placed first alphabetically. Nothing important happens here so don't feel you need to waste your money buying this book, unless you want to buy mine!"
1,Sloppy and Unprofessional,"For the few ideas you might get from this book, it's not worth the price. You can find better ideas from many other authors. The work, as others have noted, is pretty unforgivably sloppy. I would be embarrassed to deliver many of the cakes pictured. And there's an interesting little copyright caveat that all the ideas belong to the author and are not to be used by others. Well, who would want to, anyway?"
2,what's all the fuss about?,"I read the reviews on this book and the brief synopsis and thought it looked really interesting. Unfortunately, it was BORING. It dragged on and on and on and . . . The heroine was wishy washy, and I'd already figured out who did it--and why--before I was half way through the book.It WAS interesting in the descriptions of funerary practices, but that was the only reason it was interesting"
1,battery not what advertise,Order it for the batteryBattery: 1400ML 2-hour extended-life batteryWas the same battery I already had only last 30 minutesreally need the extended life battery 2 hours
4,Rises above the genre,"Okayyy... So as we know, the movie stars Christopher Walken, who (given a serviceable script) can turn any B-film into something approaching high art. By having Gregory Widen (of ""Highlander"" fame) direct it, that possibility is removed instantly, but we're still left with a strangely addictive movie.It's got (as my co-worker put it) the Canadian Robert DeNiro--Elias Koteas, Viggo Mortenson (underused, but still great to see in action), and Eric Stoltz, all showing more than enough conviction to pull the film out of mediocrity.Never mind the low-budget; it's alternately campy and (don't laugh) thought-provoking, and of course, Chris Walken walks away with the film's best lines. It's worth owning just for his performance alone."
4,Good Movie,"Love the series and even though it's older it doesn't look bad on Blu Ray. Sound quality is excellent, and for anyone who never seen these movies...for the price why not give it a try."
3,A**-kicking angels,"The war in Heaven comes to Earth when the archangel Gabriel (Christopher Walken) descends in search of the soul of the most evil man who ever lived. The plot is too convoluted for its own good and it doesn't build to much of a climax, but Walken is always fun to watch."
1,Dew Detected warning won't go away,"After 6 months of pleasant experience with this DV103, all of a sudden the ""Dew Detected"" ""Eject Tape"" warnings popped out, and it wouldn't go away even though the users manual said it would go back to normal operation after the msg was gone. Problem is that it never did. It's still under Panasonic warranty on parts, but the labor will cost $150 to start with, by Panasonic service center in Illinois. Other than this problem, overall performance and quality is satisfactory. I am disappointed in how many users have the same problem, quite a few. and on DV203 too."
5,Great beginner kite!,"This thing was so much fun at the beach. We got two for our kids and they flew them for hours. Instructions were clear and well written, and the quality of the kite is very high. They survived the day without any problems and we've flown them numerous times since. Full marks all around. I'm thinking of getting a Mirage for myself, that's how much fun the kids had with these things."
3,"Jeff Freilich, Ken Wiederhorn are not the stars","Jeff Freilich, Ken Wiederhorn are not the stars of this movie. I know. I was in all three seasons."
4,Engaging Story,"Stephen Baxter has grown as a writer with this new book. It captures so much of the ambience of ancient Rome as it weaves back in forth from that harrowing time of Germanic tribes and Roman decay to the modern, with George Poole, our modern protagonist, searching and finding his mysterious long lost sister. The divergently evolved human hive underneath Rome is believeable on many levels. I enjoyed the glimpses into the deep future, with the eusocial humanoids having created hives on other plants during a great human expansion into the galaxy. Very good Book!!"
3,Not one of his best ...,"Not up to Stephen Baxter's usual standard. Even the theme jarred with his previous works, leading to a general feeling of dissatisfaction with the whole offering. It's by no means a bad book, but fans will I think be disappointed."
5,Now a fan of Stephen Baxter,"I enjoyed this sci-fi book. Went on to read other books by Stephen Baxter such as; Exultant, The Time Ships, Phase Space, Conqueror, Emperor. Graphic scenes, so much detail. I liked how it focused on characters that were ancestors and some descendants."
3,Setting the scene for the rest of the series?,"I got the feeling with this book that its really setting the scene for the next books of the series (which I haven't read).The trouble with this book is that its just plain dull for hundreds of pages - and only really started to get my interest in the last 50 or less pages - which is a shame, because the story has a lot of potential that will hopefully be developed in the next books. Its for that potential that I've given 3 stars.I might try and track down the others in the series from a library (buying them is out of the question) - but Stephen really should have made an effort in making this one more lively if he expected readers to make the investment of reading others in the series."
5,A MUST fun book for every Flowergirl!,"If you are planning your wedding, this is a MUST book to give to your flower girls upon honoring them with your invitation to join your wedding party. It explains exactly how ""special"" they are to the bride and groom, how important their addition is to the wedding party, and takes them through every step to your wedding day from the first bridal shower to the ceremony, to the reception. Recommended reading for every flower girl to read or to be read to."
3,Awful!!!,"Just awful!! That is all I have to say. I would like to give it zero stars. If you are into intense stuff, skip this one. If you like fluff, fluff, fluff, go for it. The age thing didn't disturb since it was a period novel. Girls were married at 13, had babies at 14."
1,Very Disgusted w/ Amazon over this.,"Ordered this item and it arrived without the CD. When I contacted Amazon their only solution was to return it. I rec'd an email from Trader Tom to please leave feedback, but it had no direct contact information so I could let them know about this issue. My hope was that they could just ship me the CD. So we will be returning this item, but I will not be repurchasing it. There would be no garuntee that it would arrive in full the next time."
1,What a joke SAVE YOUR $ Read the manual,"This book is nothing more than a reiteration of the manual that comes with the camera. He does throw in some basic photo techiniques and information that anyone buying a $1000 would probably already know. For $35 your money would be more wisely spent on a book dedicated to photographic technique, or taking a basic class. It is a cheap photocopy on cheap paper. I cannot believe the author Dennis Curtain can foist this off as helpful information. I will never order anything from this author."
2,Rudimentary!,"The D70's factory manual covers this exact same content to a better extent, and is actually a better read.A very disappointing purchase, especially when considering the cover price.There are better DSLR and D70 guides online for free!If you can't open the box for the D70 then this manual is probably your speed.Avoid."
3,Good for the money,"These aren't very comfortable, but they work for the color I was needing. I'm usually a 7.5 to an 8 and the 7.5 I ordered worked just fine. The straps are a little harsh so they aren't super comfy, but they work ok."
4,A nice piece of equipment,"I took the advice of the previous reviewer and contacted Iogear prior to purchase. After establishing that my two pc's had no known issues that would conflict, placed my order. On amazon's behalf I give them praise for outstanding delivery speed. With Super Saver free shipping, had unit in 3 business days. After reading instructions and following them exactly, unit was up and running in ten minutes. So far I am very happy with the performance.I would have given it 5 stars but I also have some problems with typing on the keyboard and getting repeated letters at times. But the networking, Monitor, mouse and USB device sharing work great. I working with a PC Shuttle, Pentium 3, ATI Radeon 9100 IGP Video, Win-XP,..... A Dell 17"" LCD monitor......... and a Custom built Pentium 4 PC with a NDIVIA GeoForce 7600GS video card and Win- Vista Premium"
1,Seams split,"Look nice, but after about a month I see that the seams are splitting (inseams mostly, but also outseams). The thread just pulls out in places. Spent about 30 minutes last night hand stitching them back together, an inch here, 2 inches there, 4 spots altogether. Still waiting to see if this is just a spot problem or if the sewing along the entire seams were defective. This is clearly a defect, and has nothing to do with wear.Amazon says that if I return them now, I'll have to pay a restocking fee. Check your pants early!"
4,Loved it,"I loved this book, easy read and a love story....I will continue reading the other books from this author, once I picked up the book - it was over before I knew it."
1,"Low quality, very disappointing","I didn't expect this kind of problem, but it came with several (!) very noticeable defects (including cracks) in the wooden posts. It was obvious that the cracks appeared during the assembly process or right after, not in shipping. Bottom line: poor (if any) quality control. Defects aside, it looks like something worth $30-$40, cheap. This is not a quality product; I requested a refund."
4,What were you expecting?,"To the one-star review: cryptic reviews do nobody any good and make you look like a fool. 'Nuff said. Anywho, this is the perfect album for a Trux fan. They are no longer on the major and it shows. I don't want every album to sound the same. Who does? I think they've taken all the best elements of their past sound and put it down on a very mature and great album. Right on."
3,work pretty well,"i love the idea of these but they do tend to roll down when you sit down. other than that, i really like them."
5,Great,"All right, let's get right down to it! When it comes down to intimate apparel, there is nothing that captures a man's eyes and imagination as thigh-high stockings!These soft and sexy stockings wear well, and stay up. So, you don't need to use a garter, but I do recommend one. (I don't believe in understatement in the bedroom.)I highly recommend these stockings to you - or for you men, buy them as a gift!(Review of Sheer Lace Top Back Seam Thigh Hi Stockings)"
4,decent,"Very good looking and fits well, will get little scratches/rips just like any pantyhose though if you aren't careful. I got what I paid for, i'm happy about it"
2,"Not worth it, even with the low price.","I've been looking for a pair of cheap thigh highs, and I thought these could be the perfect ones... but I was wrong. They're pretty but such low quality that I had to return them for a full refund. Not only did these stockings run after just minutes of trying them on (and I wasn't doing any kind of vigorous activity - just walking around my bedroom) but one stocking was several inches shorter than the other. I will not be purchasing from this brand again."
3,Very sexy!,These are very sexy hose. The lace is very pretty and great for garters. However they do snag very easily. They are very very thin. The stitch up the back was hard to line up but still a nice buy.
2,Left out their best song,"I wanted CBB for the song ""I Love You"" and was given this as a present. Unfortunately is isn't on here. The rest of the songs are decent, but I rarely listen to this cd."
4,DVD scratched before I got to see the ending,"Roald Dahl described a thoroughly detestable school figure in ""Boy"" and repeated it in ""Matilda"". I don't know which he created first, but the characters are so like autocratic figures and petty functionaries that one endures when life takes a nasty turn. We are better off for the experience, and we have to learn to laugh through the misery. I could just see bank officials, license examiners, title company agents, claims adjusters and the like mishandling everything as they puffed their puny chests and acted their minor roles to unappreciative audiences. It was just fitting that the DVD was flawed at the height of the dramatic action. Matilda would have known what to do with whomever or whatever caused the flaw."
2,Great Movie but I wanted WIDESCREEN,Nothing special about this edition except extras. We want widescreen!
2,A Movie for Children? A Good Flick? Not...,"Is this really a movie for children? I don't know.The school principal throws a boy out the window and it's a comedy. Pretty scary for kids who suffer abuse.Towards the end of the movie the kids pelt the principal with paint and other school supplies to drive her away. True, she's an ogre, but whatever happened to non-violent ways of getting rid of nasty folks?Then the lead girl asks her parents to give her up for adoption, which they do with nary a hesitation. Yikes-a-doodle.As with most Hollywood flicks, this one is short on character development, semi-long on plot, and super long on technical gizmos. It appears to be ""liberal"" but with such small-mindedness it's not very open at all. And the main characters are exclusively white, while Black kids sit in the back of the bus.Choose ""The Story of the Weeping Camel"" instead."
4,A Nice Movie for Children,"""Matilda"" is about a small girl in a home more interested in making a sleazy buck than thinking about its children. Worse yet, she is sent to a private school led by an abusive former female Olympic shot-put, hammer-throw, and javelin winner.The good news is that Matilda develops special mind powers that enable her to free her teacher from the abusive principal and recover her home, as well as free herself from her non-caring parents - to be adopted by her wonder teacher."
2,"Too long, too advanced","I love all kinds of pilates DVDs typically, but not this one. It's very long and you must be able to do advanced poses. Quite frankly, I found it rather dull at times, also. Plus, the directions aren't always very clear."
4,Great combination of Pilates and Yoga,"I teach Pilates and wanted some ideas to add to my routines. This DVD provided this. I also have used some of the flows in my Yoga classes. The students seem to enjoy a different type of flow. The only reason I did not give this DVD 5 stars, is because they do not truly explain how to do the Pilates breathing techniques very well and proper alignment of the pelvis. So if you already know these things, this a great DVD. Enjoy!"
4,Pleasantly surprised,"She writes with a style of simplicity and rhythym and ease that you can sit down and read the book in one sitting. There are few if any dry spots. It flows very well, and you can see the characters and events clearly. She must be proud to be a new author and have produced such a successful work."
3,Very Helpful,I found this book to help out when Iwas selling my vehicle and purchasing a used vehicle. I used the tactics and helpful hints and was successful in getting the right car for the right price.
2,"Connection is not stable, computers on Lan network not recognized","The product has some problem maintaining a smooth connection. As a lot of other reviewer have complained, I have to restart it even a few times a day. Also, it does not translate the domain name of the computers on your Lan network. The connection is ok, but you just cann't find the network computers in your Network Places. Consulted custumer service. I was told that I should consult Microsoft, not them. Because right before they say so, they asked me when I bought it. I said about four month ago. I think they thought I would not be able to return the product, so they did not need to get involved. Anyway, not a decent thing."
1,Terrible product/service. Urge you never to buy D-Link,"This was a difficult router to set up. Could not be done w/o extensive tech support. Then, just after warranty expired, gee, what an amazing coincidence, the router died/froze up. Of course, tech support refused to help and sent me to the ""help"" web page, which was just one more waste of time. Now I have to buy a new one. In fact, that's what tech ""support"" told me I probably needed to do. Wow, even D-Link technicians are telling me just to buy a new router?!?!? I urge you NEVER to buy a D-Link product."
3,All is fine except for one,I would have given 4 stars if this guys doesn't reset so much... it resets very frequently... signal strength and rest all is fine...
1,It need power reset every 2 or 3 days....,"very bad product, very bad tech support, useless.Never buy D-link again."
1,router reboots and will get the boot soon,"My first WBR-2310 kept rebooting until it just stopped working. Dlink connected me to India, I sat on hold for 20 minutes until my call was dropped as it was answered by them. I went through that 3 times and came extremely close to smashing the router. I decided it would be better just to exchange it for a new one. Now I am on my second router and having similar issues (not quite as bad but still rebooting quite often). I would never buy a dlink router again. The equipment doesn't work and the support is the worst I have ever dealt with because they can't even figure out how to answer their own phones."
1,Drops connection every few minutes,"I've tried everything and I'm at my wit's end. Tossing this thing in the trash and buying an Airport in the morning. Up yours, Dlink."
1,Poor router and customer support - Do not buy!,"I bought router in Oct 2006 and started having problems by March 2007 - similar to other customers my router routinely ""froze up"" requiring me to unplug router for 2 minutes and re-plugin. Unfortnately, this has become daily routine! Customer service took long time to respond, insisted that new firmware would fix, which it didn't, and was generally not knowledgeable. It's not worth even trying to go through RMA process - I will throw my router in trash. I previously had a Linksys 4 port wireless router from Feb 2000 until Oct 2006 and only was replacing becausing wanted to upgrade from 802.11B to G - it worked flawlessly for several years without ever touching the firmware. I will not make the mistake of buying DLINK again. Can't wait until my new Linksys G router arrives."
3,Not as good as expected,"Well, I purchased this router because the difference with the price according with the same model here in my country is huge.However, I was closed to return the router because it was not working in the beginning, the led for wireless was not on and no access to the device, was rebooted many times and reseted as well and nothing.I was almost to go and buy a new one here in Costa Rica because I really need it and suddenly it started to working and it is working OK, no perfect since sometimes I have to disconnect to the network and reconnect to get Internet access.That is all I have to say about it..."
1,Locks up then dies,"Bought on Nov 2007. It started locking up in Jan 2007, required reset, power recycling several times per day. Stopped working May 2007. No help from tech support."
1,Absolutely terrible,"This series is bound to draw comparisons to Zahn's trilogy, being the only other trilogy set before the aimless admixture of random hack authors' ideas into the Star Wars universe turned the whole liscense to utter [junk]. And of course, Kevin J. Anderson, who went on to butcher another epic (Dune), manages to take characters I used to like and turn them into two-dimensional cliches. This is the series that turned me off to Star Wars novels, when I realized that no one was screening these authors.As to the novel itself. Poor plot, poor dialogue, terrible villains, and don't even ask about the protaganists... Working with characters such as Luke Skywalker and Han Solo, Anderson somehow manages to make me hate them. I absolutely can't say enough about this novel and series as a whole. If you have any respect for the Star Wars legacy at all, please pass on this one. Pick up a copy of Zahn's trilogy and try to forget that any other Star Wars books were written."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,It seems many people think this is either terrible or superb. But read the trilogy by Timothy Zahn you will see that this is pure crap. Superweapon after and superweapon. The story is predictable and boring. Only really gullable people who have no taste and love McDonalds will like it. Avoid like Ebola.
3,Good but not great,"Though it contained a lot of action, this book was a big disappointment in that the dark Jedi was defeated so easily and quickly early on. The battle seemed unrealistic. Though Anderson's style is more fit for a TV series or comic book, he once again puts the characters through their pace and sets up a lot of events which will effect the Star Wars timeline. Definitely recomended if you want to make sense of what happens in later Star Wars novels."
2,"Okay, but not the best of the trilogy.","For the most part,I think KA was just trying to fill in the book with unneeded material to fill up the book and end the trilogy. The resolution of the Exar Kun crisis comes right at the beginning,suddenly the Sun Crusher is more vulnerable than in JS and DA for plot purposes,and cliffhanger endings stud the latter portion of the book when it should be used to wrap the blasted trilogy up. However, I thought the trilogy as a whole was a quick and easy read. Hope DarkSaber is better."
5,It's a good book.,"""Champions of the Force"" is a great book.It's a good trilogy ender and it's fast paced.Just like all of Kevin J. Anderson's books this is amazing."
3,"Great study aid, terrible printing quality","I was very disappointed when this book came, as the print quality is awful. I would expect better. I have a hard time even reading some of the print and it looks like someone just ran it through a cheap copier. With that said, I highly recommend the Englishman's Greek Concordance as a reference and study aid, just try to find a better printing."
2,Poor aroma,As I should have expected from its low price that the products didn't have much of aroma for which you usually expect from Black Truffle. I don't think i will buy this again.
1,something smells bad!,"This latest version has really dropped the ball big time. There seems like a musical propaganda going on with this poorly written musical guide. Any ""reference book"" that doesn't include a legendary band like DEEP PURPLE who have sold over 130 million albums, seems very odd indeed.The whole book lacks any real helpful insights to many of the artists I did know about. I bet the folks behind this book are the same ones who help run that Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. It seems they want to shape the way ""the public"" thinks about music.A much, much better reference book is the AMG music guide. Their book contains every band and gives honest reviews."
1,"I used to like this book, the original that is","No George Harrison, but Milli Vanilli and Paula Adbuhl? This just goes to show you what a joke Rolling Stone has become. Looking at the publication date they omitted George Harrison after his death. What insensitivity, compounded by the fact that he was one of the Beatles to which credit is certainly due for helping to exist a culutre that a magazine like Rolling Stone started as a result of, and certainly thrived from.Rolling Stone has lost most of what little respect I have for them anymore."
1,Horrible!!!,"A friend got this ""book"" for me since I am a big Survivor fan. It took me all of 5 minutes to read this junk. As a female I was appalled by it. It's meant to be cute and funny or something but all I found it to be was demeaning to women DEFINATELY NOT insightful for girls. Sure if you or your daughters want to be nothing but useless tools for men then maybe you might like this ""book"". Never in my life have I agreed with book burning until I read this drivel. I would have given it 0 stars but it wasn't an option. I'm definately returning this piece of crap. I weep for the poor trees that had to be destroyed just so this idiot can make another buck."
4,A real resource,I have really enjoyed this book. It was recommended by a master Windsor Chairmaker and it is great. It would have been five stars except for the plans included. They are a little too small for old eyes.
2,An Odyssey...but not thee kind I wanted,A nice read but a bit too much about the author rather than about the people of New Guinea.
2,Not Leslie At Her Best,"This one is basically reruns of Leslie's older videos. The Walk Diet was one I'd owned for years, from Leslie's first efforts at videos, I think. It is ok for absolute beginners who have trouble moving. For all others, I'd skip this.The 30 Minute Walk is lots newer than Walk Diet. Has a slick set design, and much more movement. But, again,it's an old video, and I already owned it. Had walked with it many times.The 30 Minute Walk is on the disc twice, and the Muscle Mile One is not on the disc. Also, the blurb on the back of the case says that the Walk Strong Express is done with the stretchie band. However, the actual video has Leslie and her friends using dumbells and other weights. It's a good video, and gives me a good workout. It just isn't the one that the back of the case says it is.Whoever put this one together did not do a good job.Also, I thought I was buying something new, not rehashes of old stuff.If I'd known what was on the disc, I would not have bought this one."
5,Excellent High Quality Made in the USA Wood Rack,"I've had this rack for over a year now and it works great. It took a little time to put together but was fairly easy for me to assemble with the tools I had on hand. I've had to move it once and it was easy to move. One of the end caps arrived damaged, and with one email to Woodhaven a new one was on its way. This is a very study rack and will last for many years to come. (Cover is however made in China.)"
3,"Very pretty, but poor quality","Solid 14k Yellow Pink Enamel Childrens Butterfly Earrings - JewelryWebThese earrings are very pretty, but one of the earrings was bent when we received them. My daughter was able to still wear the earrings, because we were able to bend it back to be straight enough to screw in the safety screw backs.. but over time the butterfly wing would bend forward and need to be pushed back. Eventually the pretty pink enamel on the wing broke off.. so now the earring had one pink side and one gold side... ultimately the wing snapped off and the earrings needed to be replaced. The good news is that these earrings never irritated my daughters ears because they are real gold as advertised."
4,Good action book,"I enjoyed this book and will read more of Bonds work. The scenario is presented as fiction, but the situation in the Korea's could make this a very real situation. Hopefully, it will never come to pass, but if it does, I hope Bonds outcome will predict reality."
4,Gripping Stuff,Being a Tom Clancy and Dale Brown fanatic I looked for a similar author. I am so glad I found Larry Bond. This is his first book I've read and I could not put it down. It had the right mix of build up and action and the scene setting was remarkable. Can't wait for the next one!!!!!
5,A Very Good Techno-Thriller,"This is Larry Bond and Patrick Larkin at their best. The book gives a good account of what could happen when North Korea invades South Korea. The book is well written, and they seamlessly blend the characters into the plot. I have been a fan of Larry Bond for several years, and he did not disappoint me with this book. If you like to read techno-thrillers this is one to read!"
4,Relations have warmed but plot was very probable for years!,"This novel is scarry in that its premise was among the most probable for years (not just believable but PROBABLE). Brilliantly researched, credible. It almost seems like I'm reading a transcript of CNN. Actually, in some cases in the novel, Bond want's you to think that.What else can be said? Action sequences in the air, sea and on land are fast-paced and gripping.The only shot that misses is the pointless love interest that Bond introduces between two of the story's characters - and there are many in this tale. It was unnecessary, and gummed up a large portion of the novel's considerable pages. But don't let that distract you. Red Phoenix is a classic of the techno thriller genre. It hasn't been topped since (and it was published TEN years ago!).Read it, then watch that 38th parallel!Questions? Email me"
4,SWEEPING! Bond covers all bases in this mega techno fest!,"This novel is scarry in that its premise is among the most probable (not just believable but PROBABLE) of any techno thriller! Brilliantly researched, credible. It almost seems like I'm reading a transcript of CNN. Actually, in some cases in the novel, Bond want's you to think that.What else can be said?

It hasn't been topped since (and it was published NINE years ago!).Read it, then watch that 38th parallel!"
4,RED PHOENIX,"Typical Larry Bond; excellent war stories with lots of action. The behind the scenes activity was a little slow, but was needed for background."
5,A Better Read Than Most Tom Clancy's Books,"Red Phoenix is a better read than most of Tom Clancy'sbooks. Especially when you're interested in real-worldwar scenerios. If you want politics and heroism, buy acopy of the Debt of Honor, or the Executive Orders. Ifyou want a war game, this is your kind of book. You'llfind it absolutely absorbing."
3,Informative,"Informative, but not particularly well written. The attributions of thoughts and speech with no documentation is particularly unhelpful. Still, a necessary read for anyone wishing to have accurate, well researched hard information about Wilder's life. The photographs are the best part of the book, in my opinion. It was the first time readers were able to put faces to the people whose lives were so compelling and fascinating. The only thing missing is a photo of Jack, the brindle bulldog."
3,re:Acute Observer,"The best review of this book to date. Seems Laura Ingalls Wilder was a bit of a hypocrite. She valued self-sufficiency, yet her family lived on credit. Maybe she was in denial when she wrote her books, but the real Laura has spoiled the Little House books for me.The writing is poor as well."
4,fun to watch,"good entertainment, fun to watch. i look forward to the next season. I will continue to watch as time permits."
2,Skip it,The last two episodes were so incredible that I kind of felt sick watching this one. Don't bother watching this one if you value your time.
4,"Yes, you should watch this episode.","I am surprised by the low ratings for this episode. After reading them, I was almost tempted to skip it. But I'm glad we didn't. This was a unique perspective on the Doctor. It was quite humorous, and I love all the music from Electric Light Orchestra.This is one of the 'lighter' episodes, but definitely worth watching, and far from the worst."
5,so fun,Love The Doctor - bought the TARDIS mug. Really have enjoyed watching all these episodes. Looking forward to more. Thanks!
5,I love dr.who,I loved this season but I hated the season finally.. I love the chemistry that rose and the dr have..
3,Good follow up to classic Mott,"Turmoil. The band that finally broke through nearly broke up prior to recording this album. Without founding member Mick Ralphs, Ian Hunter shoulders most of the creative responsibility here. While he did quite well, it's clear the album was recorded under a great deal of stress.Of the best songs here, ""Roll away the stone"" was originally recorded during the MOTT sessions. ""Golden age of rock 'n' roll"" and the symphonic ""Through the looking glass"" are two of the other highlights. It was clear that Ian needed a foil and didn't have one since the departure of Ralphs.While not the band's best album (the honor would be split between MOTT and BRIAN CAPERS), it has a number of fine songs, and for me, fine memories."
4,Stott is a quality brand,"Stott products are very good quality, though they are usually more expensive than they should be because of the name. In this case, the price was actually cheaper than buying directly from Stott so it was a bargain that couldn't be passed up!"
1,Extremely dirty,I was very excited to receive it but on opening the band was VERY dirty - literally. I tried cleaning it but not successful. The dirt was kind of 'glued' to it. Went right back.
2,Eh.,"This product was a disappointment to me. I'm sure I just misunderstood what was being sold but I thought the bands came with DVD or booklet on exercises to do with them. It did not, you have to buy the DVD separately. The bands are fine, they do stink and leave the smell on your hands all day no matter how much you scrub them, but I guess that's to be expected from rubber. Just disappointed overall, though I'm sure it's my own fault."
5,Great Product,I really like these Flex-Bands due to the length that they are. They are long enough to do the Pilates exercises that I want to do. I bought some bands at a store which I later returned due to the fact that they were way too short to do the Pilates exercies that I do. I have not had these bands for very long but these bands do seem to be durable. I would recommend this product to people that do Pilates.
5,Great product,I was so excited to receive this product! I still have it and am happy to use it when I can to get healthy.
4,More than one way to stretch,I know nothing about Pilates but purchased these bands to practice archery movements. By cutting and tying these elastic bands I can make four exercise bands to simulate pulling the bowstring. There is some latex odor that seems to dissipate with time. The bands are thick and seem sturdy.
2,#30 and #98 tips don't fit.,"I ordered this set on ebay, but from the same company as here on Amazon (see www.mykitchco.com). The syringe itself isn't that bad, usable. I needed an icing syringe to use for decorating tartlets and small cakes at home. The 2 of the tips - #30 and #98 keep falling off the tip syringe, they won't stay, since the konus on the bottom is narrow (the ones that are good have wider konus on the bottom). And those are the sizes I need to make flowers on the cake, and I can't use them. I've contacted with the company today and asked to replace those 2 tips. Let's see what happens. I didn't want to return the whole product, because it's usable. I woudln't want to buy the same brand anymore, and can't really recommend this product, since it doesn't have quality of inspection, hence the problems with the tips! I didn't know at the time of purchase this set was made in China. If I had known, I wouldn't have ordered."
1,Needs a strong stomach,All of this music is from the early 1900's so unless youare looking to have an unimaginative collection of musicfrom this era you will be disappointed.
2,Doesn't actually fit,"I purchased these refills to repair the wipers on a 1992 Toyota Previa. While the refills fit into the wiper blades as designed, the 20"" is too short to fill any but the rear window wiper. I had to cut one in half and add it to another just to replace the passenger side wiper blade. Unfortunately, even after doing this, the performance in rain was very substandard, thus my low rating. They technically fit into the blades, just are not long enough to be called refills."
5,A must read for all fans!,BRISCO is a book you must read if you have any interest in wrestling and its history!! Murdock tells Jack's story in such an interesting way that will hold your attention. By far the best book of its kind I have read. Buy yours now!
2,not for beginners,"i am currently living in japan, studying japanese. i bought this before coming in order to study kanji. the book expressly advertises itself as a beginners book, but it isn't. when studying any individual kanji, you are expected to remember many more difficult kanji for each ""6 kanji"" check test. personally, i cannot remember kanji without writing it. i have showed the book's check tests to japanese co-workers who say they are really difficult, and they are fluently bilingual. i now study with kids drill books, grade one and two, and kanji power is useful as a dictionary with these drills, but as a stand alone book, it is incredibly intimidating."
2,dont buy it,"This sounds like a kid playing with a cheap keyboard. Some of the crap that is out being lumped with the same genre of music as depeche mode,erasure, and omd is appaling. If your looking for new synth music thats good checkout de/vision,Iris,mesh,or wolfsheim."
3,Eh.........it's not nearly as good as the gel,I've been using the Moisture surge gel for years and it is by far the best facial moisturizer i've ever found. Thought i'd try the spray version thinking it may last longer than the gel. It's just not the same........
1,Dont get it unless you understand Polish,"It looks like a cool movie but I'm an idiot, didn't notice it had no subtitles, it's kind of pointless trying to watch it. I'm adventurous and multi cultural and all that but I'm not about to sit through a movie entirely in Polish without a clue what anyone is saying.I hope they can re-release this with some subtitles, it seems slightly pointless to do a region 1 DVD only for the Polish expatriot community."
3,Over Priced,My dad bought this book when it came out in 1982...and he and I both realized that a lot of chords were wrong some were even left out and even a few lyrics were wrong or missing and it fell apart rather quickly...
4,Artimus Pyledriver - self-titled (DRT Entertainment),"Southern metal band's only CD they'd ever managed to release. Another long-lost title I had totally forgotten about. Had a friend of mine recently mention this disc to me, but I sort of remember like tracks like ""Gone To The Mountain"", the in-your-face ""Ride On"", ""Dirty Road White Girl"", the rocking (!) ""Shaggin' *ss"" and ""Get Some"". Line-up: Dave Slocum - vocals, Jimmy Hall & Damon Goldsmith - guitars, Michael Falkner - bass and Artimus Pyledriver - drums. Sort of sound like perhaps a 'heavier' Molly Hatchet. Should draw in fans of Alabama Thunderpussy, Clutch and Acid King."
1,AC/DC ripoff,this guy sounds worse than brian johnson does now. why can't people my age stop copying the past? be original. that's it. this style is well worn out.
4,Good But Could Be Better,This is all around a great compilation of fighting with science behind it. Really cool just wish it was a little cheaper. Definitely motivational to get out there and push your body to the extreme
1,expensive and useless,"Just bought this last week (not from Amazon). Thought they would be great. Gave my mom a cloth. Now I feel like I need to apologize to her. Used it to wipe down bathroom sink, tub and toilet. Had to do it again with paper towel. Attempted to wipe down kitchen counter, but just pushed the water all around the counter instead. $14 of useless felt is now under my kitchen sink, unused."
1,LESS THAN 1 STAR,"I bought these from Zorbeez website, not from Amazon. But I must tell you,DO NOT waste your money. These things are horrible! If you was them they leave pieces of themselves on everything!I DO NOT RECOMMEND. I WARN."
1,Worthless,"This product does not live up to ANY of its claims. Don't buy it and if you already have, return it ASAP."
4,Almost as good as www.goodkids.us.com,"This advice is similar to what is taught in foster parenting classes. Parents who follow this advice will raise better kids. I have found that the information from ""goodkids"" is more practical and realistic."
5,Best parenting book I've read,"""The Ten Basic Principles of Good Parenting"" is my favorite parenting book. That's because it focuses on the essential principles (love, consistency, etc.), yet also (a) gives examples for various situations and (b) provides guidance on how these principles apply as your children get older and mature. In addition, it provides the advice within the context of your child's age, temperament, and other factors (like whether both parents work). And it's quite readable and well-written, too."
2,Works when it wants to,"Bought these about 2 years ago. Installation is easy, no one will argue that. My passenger side light always gave me trouble. It would decide when it wanted to work or not. Checked all wires many times throughout the life of the HIDs, no issues. Checked the bulb, works fine. I am searching for a Xentec website or phone and none exists. Yes, these are cheap headlights but, I wanted something I wouldn't have to mess with every 3 days. Buyer beware!"
5,Keepyourteeth,"This is perfect for me, I work full time and there are 4 25-35 minute work outs that I can manage. AND I have been doing them a few weeks, now about 5 times a week, and I already feel stronger and better about myself. I am 53 years old, and it helps me to have strength and good range of motion, and I have already seen that rubber tire around my waist get smaller! I feel great!! Thanks so much FIRM!!!"
5,Great quality,"This is a great quality shoe, and reasonably priced. I wish I could find it in other colors."
5,doing it his way,"reed has been around a long time and is a survivor of his life style. this is one of his better live recordings, done his way. if you like reeds music this is a real treat."
2,"I didn't like only a selection, and A.C. is a boring reader.","I've read those books and with only a selection they lose all its fun and magic. Arthur is a formidable writer, but he is also a tedious reader."
4,A good classic horror movie done Hammer style,"What a great movie this is, done excellently by Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee. The story is the basic ""Mummy"" story about an ancient Egyptian High Priest who is in love with an Egyptian Princess. Princess dies, Egyptian Priest tries to restore her life, (which is HIGHLY forbidden), gets caught, gets punished by becoming a mummy who comes to life again 3000 years later. However, what makes this movie interesting is the indepth ceremony of the funeral of the princess and Christopher Lee's intricate role as the High Priest of Karnak. A great plot makes this hammer movie a must see and delight for any Hammer fan. This is a movie I can watch a few times a year and still get great enjoyment out of it. I enjoy the updated ""Mummy"" movies with Brandon Frasier, however this one is right up there with those and I believe has a more interesting story than the recent ""Mummy"" series. Highly Recommended!"
4,A Lot of Fun,"This movie is a lot of fun. As with all Hammer movies, it has good production values and excellent color cinematography. Although a fairly standard ""mummy"" plot is in play, this movie stands out for the excellent background sequence set in ancient Egypt. Lee and Cushing are both masters of the genre and always fun to watch. Four stars instead of five only because the ending seems a little abrupt and weak, but it's not enough to detract greatly from the overall pleasure of the flick."
4,Christopher Lee is very tall!,"It's amazing. Not only is this film a-typical for a mummy film (the plot is actually creative), but it is also incredibly entertaining due partially to the incredibly short man acting as the mummy's keeper who makes christopher lee look even taller than he already does. He's so tall it's exciting!"
2,Great acting but terrible cheap sets.,"The movie has some great acting, but it is ruined by the cheap production and the cheap looking sets. It will give you chills, but somehow the B-Movie production values ruin the effect."
2,Not an award winner,I would only give this book 2 stars becase I thought it would be about finding a way into a pyramid and having 10 men going in and 8 men coming out. I didn't like it when they said a group of tourists went into a tomb and found the mask and didn't even tell us about it. I wouldn't recomend this book to anyone because I don't think it has anything to teach a reader.
4,"for the price, the best brush you can get.","Did a great job. Washed with shampoo and let set for 5-10min with conditioner before rinsing out. If you take care of it and store in a stand, it will last you a very long time. Has not lost one hair.A real winner."
4,Really great for what you pay for,"It's been over a month since I got mine, and it's still pretty held together. Some hairs are starting to come out even after taking care of it and hanging it up to dry. Not the best brush out there, but it's great for a beginning brush and will last for a while."
3,Not the best,"Fairly disappointing brush. It's relatively soft, but it's pretty small and stinks. Still has a smell after washing several times. You're probably better off getting a $15 Vulfix or something like that."
4,Good enough--and GREAT for the price,"Look, if you REALLY think you're going to get a good quality badgerhair shaving brush for $10, then you're beyond help. But this one is decent, and its about 1/4 the price of anything else as good. Sure, you won't have the tremendous sense of luxury you get from one of the silver-hair brushes that run from $80 to $800, but you're miles ahead of anything else I've seen in this price range.I bought this brush to take the abuse of being in my travel kit. Any brush in there, regardless of quality, is going to wear out within a year. This one is fantastic for that purpose--I won't mind buying another one every few months, and it's not a bad brush at all."
3,Price is the only saving grace,"I should have known what I was getting into by spending so little on a brush, but it is my first wet shave brush and I didn't want to make a major investment before I knew I was going to stick with it. On the first shave I removed as much beard hair as brush hairs. After about 6 or 7 uses it still loses about 3 hairs per shave. It does a decent job of working up lather, but I don't expect the brush to last long if it continues at this rate. Thankfully I only paid $11 for it."
3,OK for the price,"Does a great job, only complaint I have is a few hairs come off during use. Hopefully it will stop soon but other than that, a good brush.Update: A few weeks after using this, the brush separated from the handle. I used little Amazing Goop to get it back together and a day or so to sit, it was fixed. It has held up fine so far, but I am careful whenever I clean the brush. And almost a year later, a few hairs are still coming off during every use."
2,Not truly from improper use,"A few reviews state that the failure of this brush is due to improper handling, use, drying, etc. This may be the cause in many cases, however I believe there is a serious lack of quality control on these brushes. I have posted pictures showing the separation of my brush from the handle after only 2 uses. The pictures clearly show that the adhesive used was insufficient and did not contact both the handle and the brush. If it would stay together, I imagine this would be a very good product."
2,its ok,I like the cheep fake badger wide brush from walmart that came with the soap. But its ok after it sheds the loose hair.
2,Not an upgrade from a long hair boar brush,I'm fairly new to wet shaving. I asked my wife if she could get me this as an upgrade to my existing long hair boar brush thinking that this would be softer and more absorbent. This brush the bristles are cut into a pleasing round shape but what that does is make them really prickly. I feel like this thing is stabbing the heck out of my face when I use it. I tried my boar brush and its soft and makes a nice rich lather just like this one without the skin irritation. I'm kind of bummed because I thought that this would improve my shaving experience but it just makes my skin feel irritated. Would not recommend.
2,You get what you pay for,"I think the only reason this brush rates so highly is because its cheap, and people don't know any better. Before I knew what I was doing, I thought well of this brush. After upgrading to a quality brush, I realize just how poorly it performs. This brush smelled terrible for the first few months. It had that terrible badger smell linger even after soaking and washing and daily use. It sheds constantly. I have owned it for almost 2 years and now only use it as a travel brush. The bristles are very hard nd don't lather nearly as well as others. They don't hold heat or water well. The paint began chipping off and the wood began to discolor after only a couple months. I always hung it to dry, so there is no excuse for that. If you are reluctanto spend the money, it is better than nothing, but I recommend simply starting with a quality brush instead."
3,"Worked pretty good, for two weeks...","The brush came out of the package looking good. After soaking the brush in some hot water and lathering up some soap I was pretty excited to use it. After two weeks of daily use, making sure to dry it immediately after use, the brush came apart from the handle while I was lathering. It had worked pretty well up to that point and I am assuming by all of the good reviews that this is a rare case, but it should be pointed out in case others come across the same problem."
4,Tweezerman's Finest,Great bang for your buck! I've had mine over a month with very minimal shedding. Smell goes away after first or 2nd shave. Good daily use brush
4,Good Brush,this is a much nicer brush than you will pick up at Walmart when you buy the soap/brush combination. You won't be disappointed.
1,Waste of cash,"I bought this thinking it would work fairly well, boy was I wrong. After three uses the hair separated from the wooden base thanks to the small dabs of hot glue giving way. I should have returned it before the return policy expired, I hate throwing money away. I've already hot glues it again and just tonight it fell apart, so into the trash it goes. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT."
4,Brush feels good but lathers not so well.,"I am comparing this to LeisureGuy's recommended Eco tools kabuki brush. I like the feel of the badger hair on my face more than the synthetic bristles the Eco tools brush has. However, the Eco tools brush builds lather like no other I have tried. Overall, this brush feels great on my face but the lathering ability isn't too impressive."
1,brand new brush sheds a ton,"Right out of the box this thing sheds like crazy. I know people will blame all sorts of mishandling as the source of the problem but today was the first time I used it and it lost somewhere around 30-40 hairs. I understand new brushes and break-in periods and all that, but this thing isn't going to last long enough to be broken in. It's really scratchy on the face (I expected it to be for the price) and it's falling apart, so I simply cannot see how I could recommend it, even at this price. It simply fails to do what it is meant to do."
5,Believe the Hype,"I used a cheap drugstore brush with Nylon bristles for years and didn't think the type of brush would make any difference, but for a few bucks more the difference is amazing. Better lather, application, and beard prep. I also switched to an old fashioned safety razor and the shave is closer, more comfortable, cheaper, and more environmentally friendly. After 35 years goodbye shaving industrial complex."
3,Average brush for average value,"This is an average brush for a bargain price. It's a step up from the synthetic brush from The Body Shop I was using before, but it's no where as nice as some the badger brushes in the $20-$35 range. The hairs are pretty rough and occasionally I feel the brush scratching my face. The hairs also fall out pretty consistently.Pros: Price, better than synthetic brushes.Cons: Scratchy, better quality available for $10-$15 more.Ovarall: 3 stars"
4,First brush,I just started wet shaving recently and someone recommended that I use badger brushes over boar or other materials. There was initial shedding/hair loss from the brush but after several uses that has decreased. This brush has great value and I would definitely purchase another one.
3,Fair enough...,"Not the best brush on the market. It is prickly and loses bristles fairly quick, but because of the fact that it really is 100% badger hair and because of the price it is a good brush for beginning wetshavers."
1,Shedded like a dog in spring,"This was my first shave brush. I bought it on 11/1/2012. I initially loved the price point and i had read that after a few shaves it would most likely stop shedding. That never happened. This brush shed at least 10 hairs per shave, every shave. It got to the point that when I would shake the water out of the brush that a few hairs would fall out. I took excellent care of the brush making sure to dry it in a brush holder and to never leave any soap in it. Today as I was shaking the water out of the brush for a shave the knot flew right out of the handle. Good thing I have a backup brush. What a piece of garbage this brush is."
1,Crap.,"I have been using the cheap shaving brush from Walmart for the last 3 years so i figured I'd go spend some money and get a brand-name one. What a joke. This thing leaves just as much badger hair on my face as it does shaving soap. Seriously, it sheds like a German Shepherd. I ditched it and went back to the $6 wally world one that lasts me about 6 months and doesn't shed."
4,Good Starter,"I'll agree with other reviews that said this brush sheds a bit. But it seemed worst to me the first shave, after a while it died down. Seems like a fine starter brush, I have no standard for comparison - but it's working fine for me with Colonel Conk's shaving soap.This is the cheapest you're gonna find a badger hair brush."
5,Good investment,I'm glad I bought this brush. I had been using a boars hair brush and had to spend alot of time building up the lather. This badger brush reduced the lather building time by at least half maybe more. I will not be going back to boars hair.
1,"Shipping is insane, buy elsewhere",I was all ready to buy this brush until I got to checkout. The standard shipping to a US address was within a dollar of the cost of the brush itself. There are many other places online to find this brush with far less onerous shipping costs.
3,Good starter brush,"It's a good entry level brush. But in my first 5 days of owning it mine has lost bristles every day; I don't think it will last longer than a month or two. If you're just getting into wet shaving, this isn't a bad start but most likely you'll be purchasing a better brush sooner or later. My advise is to spend a little more to get a brush that will last you longer. If you're just starting out wet shaving I'd recommend getting a combo set with a hanger."
5,Tha Bomb,"This shaving brush is the bomb. It simply breaks in very easy, gathers the shave soap onto the bristles wonderfully and holds up like new over the years. I purchased a second shave brush “just in case” however the first brush is working perfectly fine. Simply make sure you allow the bristles to dry by laying the brush flat or using a holder with the bristles pointing downward. You can t go wrong with the Tweezerman Men's Shaving Brush ."
2,You get what you pay for,"Initially, I was happy with this little brush. It's smaller than I expected, but that actually made it a nice size for travel. The bristles were a little stiff at first, but it lathered up nicely and it seemed to be softening, with each use. Unfortunately, after about a year of light use (it was my travel brush, not my everyday brush), the brush head popped out of the handle. There was no way to re-attach and, eventually, I had to throw it out. I may have been unlucky with my particular brush, but the price did seem too good to be true. My daily use brush (Art of Shaving) was much more expensive and has held up to daily use without any problems.I would recommend spending more to get a higher quality brush."
4,Good Quality Brush For A Fair Price,"This Badger Brush is a good shaving brush. I am new to this method of shaving along with using a safety razor. I was looking for a low price - quality brush since I am new to this kind of shaving avenue. This Badger brush does loose a few bristles when starting to use it depending on what you use (shaving cream, shaving soap, and etc.). I was happy with the price that I paid for the brush, as I wanted to see if I would enjoy using a shaving brush and safety razor."
3,badgerbangforthebuck,"I am just beginning the process of wet shaving using non-cartridge razors and brushes. I bought a NOS shaving kit at an antique store, which had a mug, soap, and a boar brush. That led to me buying this at the local grocery store for $15, and so far so good. Much better than the boar brush, it does loose hairs but I figured that was normal. I can't compare it to anything other than my old boar brush and I'd rate this as a MUCH better brush at making a good lather. For $15 I don't think you can go wrong."
1,super uncomfortable,"This brush was the cheapest badger brush I could find on amazon. And for very good reason it may be badger hair but its extremely uncomfortable and prickly. It holds a small amount of water and cannot create very much lather, probably because it is very loosely packed with hair. I quickly moved on to a brush costing a few times more but it was WELL worth the extra money. Do yourself a favor and skip this brush as a ""starter"" and go right for a middle priced brush. Much better brushes including boar brushes can be had for a little more."
3,"Not top quality, but a good starter brush","I will start by saying this is probably the best $10 brush you can buy. Then I will say that there are A LOT of more expensive brushes, and I mean even $30 -$50 that are much better than this brush. If you are trying to go cheap to see if wet shaving is something you want to do before you invest big money, then this is an ok brush to get you started, however most who love wet shaving will say don't even bother. I used this brush to get started about a year ago and it got me to a place where I wanted to experience something different. A Thater and a Chubby 2 later, I have a small brush collection and long ago gave this brush to someone else who was interested in wet shaving.Moral of the story, if you are just starting, maybe go with a $50 Thater unless you really aren't sure if you will like it at all, then use this brush to give it a try."
3,"not a bad brush, but","i tried the tweezerman brush and have to say its ok, not bad. my main comment is if you like a substantial brush with a dense full knot to really work lather/exfoliate you might not be happy. i've used it for around a month now and have to say for the price i wouldn't return it after using, but its a bit petite for me. i'll use it for a travel brush. construction seems fine"
2,Tweezerman brush,Brush holds the soap well and is soft but I thought the badger was still alive. The badger Oder is still there can't seem to get it out. Any suggestions? Other than that it seems to be a nice brush for the price.
2,Flimsy construction.,"I was so excited about this product - I got this, my new shaving soap, and my nice razor together and proceeded to mix up the lather for the first time ever, and the bundle of hairs popped off in the middle of my shave. It worked really well while it lasted, but it didn't even last one shave so... yeah. You really weren't very careful with this one, Tweezerman. Everyone should be aware of this possibility when you buy one of these, because I'm not the only one who's reported this. For such an integral part of my kit, I'll pay another 10 bucks for something that will last longer than one shave."
2,"Cheap junk - sheds, smells, cracked handle, poorly finished","You get what you pay for. Brand new, my Tweezerman brush shed like a sick cat, smelled bad when wet, had a small crack on each side of the handle, and even had a small piece of paper embedded in the lacquer. I wish I could return it, but I tossed the packaging and didn't get around to using it for a month. I think the shedding has finally stopped and the smell is gone (probably from the glue) but I'm going to sand and refinish the handle. It works, but it's definitely the bottom of the barrel for a badger hair brush. Get something better if you have the money."
4,Good Inexpensive Badger Brush,"Most pure badger hair brushes on the market sell for at least $50, so this is a bargain compared to most. For the first week, my brush shed a little; however, this stopped after the first week. I have been happy with the brush, especially considering the price. I would recommend this brush for anyone who thinks they want to start using a shaving brush. This is a good, inexpensive way to ""test the waters"". Then, if you find that you will continue using a shaving brush, I would recommend buying a higher-end brush."
3,"Good for the price, doesn't last long.",I have had this brush for four months and it has been pretty good. Although now it doesnt flare out taking a shurnken shape. Maybe its because I didnt store it properly as I would shake out the water and place it in a cup. Decent for the price but I think I will be upgrading soon.
1,Fell apart after a few weeks.,"I used this brush for a few weeks and today, the part that holds the bristles came unglued and fell right out of the wooden handle. Wasted my money on this brush. :-("
5,Works like a charm!,"I saw this item an was skeptical at first,Seeing the price compared to others I've seen.But to my surprised this brush works like a charm!You get a real thick foam built up,holds lotsa moisture!and I have had no shedding,it's a great buy!"
1,"Bad brush, and Amazon has a better, cheaper alternative","This brush is mediocre at best and quite prone to failure. I suggestEcotools Bamboo Finishing Kabuki, 0.15 Pounds (Pack of 2). For essentially the same price you get TWO brushes. These are make-up brushes but they make excellent shaving brushes and feel very good on the face. And they have no bad odor. Brush the soap until the bubbles in the lather being formed at microscopic, then bring brush to you (wet, washed) beard and work the lather up and into your stubble. The brush holds plenty of lather for multiple passess.Better and cheaper: what's not to like?"
1,What happened?,Love Tweezerman products. I ordered one of these brushes several years ago and love it. Just ordered a replacement and the hairs are all falling out. Definitely returning.
2,You get what you pay for.,"I got this as a step up from a synthetic blend brush. And it does the job for providing a quality shave lather but I don't see this Tweezerman lasting long. When the brush arrived it already had hairs falling out inside the box and the lettering was faded almost off. A subpar product but you get what you pay for. This was on sale for $8 which is the only reason I got it, I'll gladly end up paying 3 times that to get a better brush. The hairs are dyed or mixed in some solution, when I soaked my brush in hot water to clean it the first time a residue/dye of some sort came out. Then I found hairs in my lather which inevitably ended up in my double edged razor and on my face.I wouldn't recommend this to a friend, spend some extra cash and go with a different brand."
3,Works but gets brush hair all over my face.,The brush works and seems to use decent materials but the hairs fall out and end up on my face and gunking up my razor.
4,Pecos Bill,Pecos Bill is a good witten fantasy childrens book. Pecos and his family are moving and Pecos falls out of the wagon and raised by a pack of coyotes when he was young. Later he finds he is great at wrestling animals. Pecos finds a white stallion that is the fastest ever and helps heard the cattle so the town can do things without them in the way.Pecos Bill takes place in Texas after he falls off the wagon. One thing I liked that the author did was make it a fast pace book and not run on. The problem was mainly that the texans were looking to get the cattle out of the way of their town. The best audience for this book are yong kids mostly boys. The author leaves the reading level basic and doesnt usse and confusing words. Steven Kellogg did a great job writing Pecos Bill
2,Overpriced for the contents . . .,"This book is not worth the price! It is light on the educational aspects required for successful and SAFE sausage making. The art of sausage making is not difficult, but some of the techniques can be challenging for a beginner to understand without examples, such as drawings, photos, etc . . . this book contains VERY FEW illustrations, and NO PHOTOS. This book appears to primarily be a recipe collection, of which I've noticed that a number of the recipes are strikingly similar to those found in other, far superior books available. I would highly recommend either 'Great Sausage Recipes & Meat Curing' by Rytek Kutas, or my absolute favorite, 'Charcuterie: The Craft of Salting, Smoking, and Curing' by Michael Ruhlman & Brian Polcyn over this book. Either of the alternative titles would be a much better match for someone just venturing into, or expanding on their skills in sausage making or any other type of charcuterie."
2,shimmer scarf....,"I was disappointed by the size of the scarf. I thought it would be bigger. However, for the price, I guess it was worthwhile."
4,"Good kite, unsure of the price","Bought this as a gift and it was a wonderful looking kite. It performs well and seems to be durable even with a notice crashing it a few times. I'm not ""into"" kites so I'm unsure if this is a good price or not. With a few minutes of reasearch it seemed like it is but am unsure of how to accurately compare different kites. It does fold up into a small bag for easy travel which is a plus."
1,Very nice at first!,I bought this and love it but after only a couple of months the little plastic ring that hold the phone to the clip broke off! I almost lost my phone but I found it on the floor of my car. I am now buy the Cell Mark Universal Belt Clip instead.
3,"Only for utter, absolute beginners!","This book is perfect as a gift for kids who wish to start out in a/c modelling. It covers the absolute basics, and should get them up and running in no time.However, the a/c covered in the book are of ancient kits, most of them from the 60's-70's. Technology and standards have improved by loads since then. How one is expected to procure them now is anybody's guess. If the author had taken up some of the recent kits, and showed his stuff, it would have been more useful.Also, most of the techniques covered in the book are more than available in any of the good modelling sites on the Net now. So I don't see any reason why an intermediate modeler should put his money in this book. Ashey's two books cover most of this stuff and more, and are definitely my rerefences of choice, than this one."
1,BEWARE Not Blue's Room,"I purchased this product because my son LOVES the puppet Blue. The packaging is DECEPTIVE, it is ALL cartoon except for 2 minutes of Blue and the makers of the video telling you to watch Blue's Room on Nickelodeon - which is funny because they NEVER show it!!!!!!!!!"
1,P.U.,"I own four other N.M.A. compact discs and I really enjoy them. I'm not sure what happened here, but file this one under ""painful listening"".Weak,trite lyrics and limited jams. I want to get rid of this CD, but I can't see giving to a real friend. Sorry guys..."
2,Don't buy this! You can have mine!,"I really really wanted to like this album. I read other online reviews for months and each time decided not to buy it. But then I heard samples of the good tracks and finally broke down and bought it. Mistake.Though about 3 of the tracks are excellent, and another 4 are acceptable, the others are painful. So painful I don't think I can ever listen to this again. I'm not sure who sings Otay, One to Grow On (it will never grow on me that's for sure), Polaris, and Time for the Sun to Shine, but they need to stop singing for this band.Even though NMA's live shows still rule don't buy this. Just let it go, never think of this album again, unless you like MTV hot tracks and you like canned rap rock with bubbly lyrics.What happened? Why did I buy this? Refund please?"
1,If you liked their raw blues sound ..save your money,"This album could not be further from that.What used to be a very live sound reminiscent of early Allmans and Cream is replaced by an overproduced pop slickness that will leave you cold.Maybe they are trying to get more radio airplay or find a new fanbase, who knows? I believe they will lose many early fans with this effort.The first two NMAS releases are the types of discs that I like to listen to on the road, POLARIS is the type of disc that I would pitch out the window."
1,What a dissappointment!,"I regret purchasing this cd. I love their previous recordings, but this is a let down. Does anybody want a cd?"
1,Disney Should Be Embarrassed,"REALLY!? The kids borrowed from another family and even as I read the cover I couldn't help thinking like another reviewer,""haven't I seen this before?"" And I know Disney has had a few box office failures but even those were respectable productions. THIS IS GARBAGE, weak character rip-offs of both Madagascar and Lion King. Weak plot and weaker story-line. Just Bad bad bad. Anyone whom gave this junk a high rating should engage their kids more often and more directly with play."
2,Juvenile enough for small children but has some scenes that'd send them running,"If you want a pair of really good movies on this type of theme, look at ""Madagascar"" and ""Over the Hedge."" Both have interesting characters, a good plot and they're not so filled with violent images that might disturb your younger kids."
1,this movie has nothing to it!,"This movie is dumb. It would be alright if yo u got to know all the other characters. And I think I saw this movie before, it was called madagascar! Don't get this movie! It short and pointless. If you want to watch something with your kids, don't pick this up. I recomend Chiken Little or the incredibles! sure chiken little might be short, but atleast it tells about its characters! I really don't recomend this one...at all!P.S. Don't buy it, watch it or... anything else that is similer. What a snoozer, twenty bucks is such a loss!"
5,My grandkids loved it!,Very cute movie. My 11 year old and 6 year old loved it and I think my 4 year old will too!
5,"Very underrated! Eddie Izzard ROCKS! ""Look, I'm a Starfish""!","I have to admit that I normally take my nephews to see all these movies. However, we had skipped this one because we were told it was a ""Madagascar"" spin-off (and we didn't really find ""Madagascar"" very funny). On a whim, I bought a copy when the movie was released to DVD and WE LOVE IT! The story was MUCH more appropriate for kids then ""Madagascar"" and much funnier! We loved the soundtrack (bought that too) and, for anyone who loves Eddie Izzard, he was even funnier then in concert (hearing that comic timing and out-of-the-blue remarks coming from a Koala was priceless ""Look, I'm a Starfish!"")"
2,A bit disappointing,"The format of this video made it a bit cumbersome to me. They really dragged out the ""human interest"" aspect by focusing on the individuals receiving treatment. That part went on and on. They also included interviews with ""experts"" from the film The Secret who didn't really seem to have a lot to contribute regarding tapping. Frankly, I think they were stuck in to try and capitalize on the popularity of The Secret and try to sell this video.The interviews with the actual tapping practitioners were more helpful, but again, if your main interest is learning how to tap, or finding out how it all works, this was a bit of a slog. I certainly won't watch it again, and wouldn't give it to a friend to watch. I'll probably try to sell it."
5,GRIPPING,"I'm not a fan of historical romance since sometimes I found it hard to imagine...being in the time when I wasn't born *smile* (call me lack of imagination). But this one is different. I found myself hooked to the story of a plain-woman and an outsider. Rachel Yoder is a Plain woman. Her husband died and left her with one son. Until one day, an outsider came to her house, bloody, near death, with two pistols and a knife. And so, one remarkable love story begins...."
5,Excellent,"Williamson has a way of grabbing hold of your heart without you being aware of it. You'll find yourself laughing and crying for her very real characters that she creates. She finds the little things about people that make you fall in love with them...with each other. Her books don't ooze with emotional drivel,like some romances, but shimmer with ordinary everyday feelings that we all live and relate to. I was riveted."
4,Wasnt sure ..but this was an excellent read,Not having read much of this genre I expected that I might not get past the first chapter but these characters are great!!! I really enjoyed the characters and the adventure!!! It has got me looking through other Melanie Jackson titles.
1,Discontinued Product,"I paid $59.99 for this and by the time I realized that it was ""discontinued"" I had already opened it and so couldn't return it. An inquiry to the manufacturer about upgrading to the current release brought the following sad response. I got suckered on this. In the future I will be more careful to read the fine print.""Please advise the cost of upgrading my version 1 Printshop to version 2.They responded:Your cost will be $ 39.95 plus $ 5.95 fee for shipping and handling.Customer ServiceSoftware MacKiev""If J&R; Music and Computer World and Amazon had any sensitivity to customer satisfaction, they would give me a refund on this. As it stands I am stuck with a discontined-obsolete product."
2,"Had potential, but dissapointing","I was planning a roadtrip around America this past springand thought reading this book would psyche me up evenmore for it. Well, it didn't quite do that. I didn'tfeel that there was anything to the book except thatthey saw some Elvis stuff along the way. I guess I was justused to Kerouac's On the Road where he tells of anamazing story and the road is just the backdrop of whathappens. Anyway, that is what I think."
2,"Me, Glorious Me!!!","From a man who makes his classes on Great American Fiction at John Carroll University read his own novel what can one expect? Not much. It constantly surprises me that Wingardner has not already written a novel entitled ""Let Me tell you About Me,"" with a follow up novel entitled ""More about Me."" Wingardner fancies himself a great writer, I supposes there's no harm in letting him go on in his dillusional ways. ""Elvis Presley Blvd"" is just another road trip novel. I'd rather read the Atals."
2,The book did not help me!,This book was not a good study guide for the middle grade content test 0146. It was very misleading and I ended up studying things I did not need. The information I needed for the test was not in this book!!!
3,Holding back review,"This book is designed for the casual reader, who will not take the time to wade through academically oriented material which says essentially the same thing. Ideas concerning personal responsibility and self- motivation are expressed well, and Burton's writing style is very ""readable.""All in all, a helpful book."
5,Heart warming and sad,"Liam Neeson does well in this version of Les Miserables. I've never seen the original or play, this was my first time seeing this movie. I enjoyed it so much that I went out and bought it. A once prisoner turned good, doing good for the people."
4,Always a great movie,I have always loved this movie. The Musical is almost better than the movie. It's more emotional. Better acting in the musical
1,"Let's make a mockery of a classic, shall we?","This movie was an awful adaptation of the book. It lacked depth and the merciless slashing of characters was almost humorous. How could they cut out Eponine? Eponine is a truly loved character in the book and the musical, how lacking in vision must you be to cut her out? Painting Marius as the leader of the rebels was completely in defiance of the Victor Hugo character. And Claire Danes was actually more whiny and affected than in any of her previous movies... which is saying a lot.Don't bother with this silliness."
1,i didnt like it,"I seen this Movie in English. and i didnt like it at all. i found it boring and the guyz hittin faintain and it isnt right. my friends and i didnt like it at all. it had a story... buh it was kind of jumpy. we only watched the first part, i would like to see the second part just to see how it all ends and everything. but to be honest i didnt like the movie at all. i am a grade 9 student and i dont think i know anyone who likes the movie. other then the teacher (maybe)"
4,enjoyable,"There are many movies out there that wind up as extremely disappointing adaptations of the books they come from, but this particular movie is a rather faithful version of the book. Of course, it's not 100 percent the same as the book, but no movie ever is,. The acting is great, I especially liked Javert's actor. If you liked the book, then you should enjoy this movie. The acting and props are great, and the script is fairly faithful to the book (at least, as far as movie adaptations go) Enjoy!"
5,Great Story of Redemption and Love,"This movie was a wonderful story of true love, which always means sacrifice. A must see!"
4,WONDERFUL,"I would probably love it if it wasn't for the fact I couldn't raise the volume or make the picture full screen, (probably both my fault). But all and all it wasgreat,especially Liam, one of my favorite actors and I go back to the daysof Cagney and Bogart."
3,Les Miserables,This movie was not the movie that I wanted. I wanted the movie that had Anne Hathaway. It was okay but not great.
4,New version of Les Miserables is pared down to essentials,"I really enjoyed this version of Les Miz because it's one of my favorite stories. I have four other video versions of the story, and will be happy to add this one to my collection. However, fans of the musical and of the book may be disappointed by what is left out of this screenplay: the reasons for the student revolution and almost all the members of the ABC, any further mention of the Thenardiers after Valjean takes Cosette from them, any mention at all of Eponine, and information about Marius--where he came from, what he does for a living, why he joined the revolution. (And I didn't like the idea that Valjean would slap Cosette because she had lied to him.) Still, I think paring the movie down to essentials allowed the actors to focus more on the primary relationships."
2,"acting was good, story compared to book was HORRIBLE!!!!!","The acting was the best I've seen, and the casting was good but what a disgrace!!! Whoever wrote this play needs a CAT scan b/c there has to be something mentally wrong with them! Victor Hugo wrote an incredibe book that was overwriten by some one who THOUGHT they could do a better job. It was a disgrace and Victor Hugo would be really upset if he saw it. I couldn't even watch the end of the movie it was so far from the wonderful book. Who does the writer think they are to change a classic tale?? I'd like to give them a peice of my mind!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Not Worth Viewing,"I very much wanted to see this movie when it first came out and so I did, but was very disapointed.After watching the Dream Cast musical on several occasions. You would think they could make something wonderful out of this book but it looked like to me they didn't even try."
4,It is NOT a musical!,"Don't expect the musical that has taken the world by storm during the past decade. This is the actual Victor Hugo story, as he conceived it. Very well edited, it is seldom allowed to drag, though everyone knows what a long epic it can turn out to be. Uma Thurman as Fantine is excellent, Claire Danes as Cosette too is v.good. Liam Neeson is, as usual, competent. No American Hollywood accents here - all clear British speech. The crowd scene (Barricade) is outstanding. Worth a watch."
3,Les Miserables: The movie,"I did not like this movie much at all! I thought that it was good, but it didn't stick to the story at all. Eponine wasn't even in it. Whoever made this movie had a really great chance to make something really, really, fabulous, but I think that they blew it. Next time they make a movie based on an excellent classic like Les Miserables they should base it closer to the story."
4,Great movie,"This version with Liam Neeson is more gritty that the musical version out in 2012. It was very enjoyable and well acted; Clare Danes was not that great, though.I would have liked the story to have continued a little more."
3,Not the best guide,This is an average guide to spending time in Italy if you want to avoid the opulent cities. It does include hotel/restaurant/... info in the back.Printed in Singapore.
2,"Great player, not a great book","Let me start off by saying that I am a huge sports fan, (I adore ESPN sportscentury) and in particular a big fan of walter payton. So, I picked this book up with pretty high expectations, after just finishing ""When Pride Still Mattered,"" an incredible biography of Vince Lombardi. Unfortunately, unlike ""When Pride Still Mattered,"" I felt that this book was poorly written, and tedious to read. Compounded with that is the very expensive price of this book. Perhaps it is worth it to purchase this book in paperback, but nothing else."
3,Odd,"That about somes it up. This sex crazed doctor lives up in a castle on a hill with his crazy assistant. He develops this brain wave transfer machine. He figures out how to transfer his lusty brain waves into every woman he meets.In this book over thirty different women come to the door including several unsuspecting people, a few nuns and the police inspector's daughter.After he turns all the girls into lusty sex-fiends and locks them away in the tower, the police begin too investigate. Sigh. This novel was all over the place, the doctor is the narrator and he's crazy so the book's pace is eccentric and the story is more humorous than erotic.It wasn't what I thought I was getting into but I had to finish it all the same."
1,better when not trying to be funny,"Ray Gordon is one of the better Erotic authors writing right now. Then why the one star. Because every now and then he decides to write a 'humorous' book, and his idea of humor is puns on names, and similar peurile humor. The sexual element (usually his strength) is undermined by the absurd characters and situations. I suggest sticking to Gordon's non humorous titles like 'Sextro' and 'Naked Lies'."
3,"Reminiscing ""Al Ponerse El Sol"" - The 60's","I saw this movie in a movie theater back in the 60's when it first came out, but I couldn't remember much of it. I simply bought it just to reminisce my youth. If you like Raphael, you'll probably like the movie because of the songs. The story is too simple: perhaps it would be helpful if they could remaster this and other movies in Spanish as many others in English have been done."
3,Well Worth the Price.,"MEET THE BARON. What a cast. MGM threw in enough players to make the film even the plot is hard to discern. No matter,the film charges along with enough sub-plots to keep one's interest.The weak link seemed to me to be Jack Pearl whose (German ?)accent began to be rather annoying after a time. Worth watching twice to find out just what is going on. GOLD RAIDERS. Two films here. A genuine Cowboy film (You already know the plot)and a Three Stooges film. This isn't a criticism they are both worth watching even though the twain rarely meet. Yes - a worthwhile pairing - enjoy! I did."
3,P.U. Pepe disappointed me.,"Very cute. Pepe,his French accent,and his female love interest are adorable.Some of it was funny,but a lot of it-not so much.The problem seems to be that when Pepe's cartoons were newer they weren't shown too often.We saw Bugs,The Road Runner,Wile E. Coyote,Yosemite Sam,Porky Pig,Sylvester,Tweety, and Foghorn Leghorn often.But Pepe was seen so infrequently that he got by with all of his cartoons being almost alike.When they're all shown back to back on the same DVD it doesn't work after the first one,for anyone over about 7."
3,Cheap brush set that performs pretty much as expected,"The metal brush tops are a little loose on all of the brushes and the camel hair brushes loose their hair very quickly in thicker paints. I used mine to glaze clay and ended up with hair stuck all over the side of my pots.I was expecting performance something along these lines, and I knew that the glazes I was using were going to be harsh on the brushes anyway. I wanted an inexpensive brush set and got pretty much the results I had expected."
3,Interesting premise ... no characters to care about ...,"'Childhood's End' has a reputation as one of the greatest science fiction novels ever written. And I'll admit the premise is compelling. But the book fails because Clarke does not create a single character worth caring about. Sure humanity is transformed, but the reader's emotions remain untouched."
3,Very Good Movie,"I saw the movie ""Jailbreakers"" online....one segment at a time. When I found a great deal on it, I bought it! I'm THE number ONE fan of Antonio Sabato Jr. I thought his acting in this movie was some of his best. I don't care for Shannen Doherty.....would have liked to see someone else play her part. I think Antonio did a great job. I have seen some movies, he wasn't as good in. I would recommend it for his fans & others. I didn't like the ending, but can't please everyone!"
5,"Wow...just, wow","When I came across this book in our school library I picked it up simply for the neato cover. okay, so I DO tend to judge a book by it's cover, but this is one case where it turned out for the better. This book has very thought provoking stuff and I love the way it's written. Plus, I got to pick up a shiney little ryhme, Swede-On-A-Bead, TeeHee. I'll shut up now, since this is acually a very good book and by having an idiot like me review it would probably only discourage potential readers."
3,Great story but cheap imaginery. Why so much blood?,"Got this movie my mistake from Blockbuster, there was wrong DVD in the box. However, a great story. But one thing is bad about this movie there is way too much blood. For no particular purpose. If the movie has less crappy scenes with blood streaming out of heads like water fountains, the movie would perhaps win an oscar. Movie like this can only end up on a pile of crap. A horor? Come on. Ridiculous. Therefore 5-2=3 stars for too much blood."
1,What a BAD movie,This was the most awful piece of crap i've ever had the misfortune to watch the story went nowhere the characters you could have cared less about the subtitling was horrible I mean white subtitles you couldn't even read them half the time and I think there was a plot but I have no idea what it was I just wish there was some way to get the hour and a half of my life back that I spent watching this movie. I usually like most movies and never turn off a movie no matter how bad it is but this movie I almost stoped it several times and stuck in something better (which would not have been hard to find) so in conclusion I HATED THIS MOVIE I mean when the characters have whole conversations and there's no subtitling telling you what there saying there's something wrong also the subtitling was full of mistakes. All in all a poor movie.
1,HORRIBLE durability!,"I got this thing and barely ever used it.. took OK pictures but I dropped it ONCE in the grass while i was camping and the shutter wouldnt open, the flash bulb blew out and I couldnt open or close the shutter! I sent it back and they wouldnt fix anything because I had tried to manually close the shutter to see if it would reset it self or something? But no.. they wanted me to pay something like $140 on a camera that I got for $150.. I always trusted Sony but now im going with another company. What a piece of junk! Get it if you know you will never ever drip it.. not even on soft grass. Good luck, losers."
4,Good for cost,"Product works well. The internal images are nothing spetacular and you need to be sure to hold still. The image burst is a bit slow, and you must hold still. For the price over all is a good buy."
2,Fuzzy picture quality,"I am so disappointed with this camera, most of the pictures are grainy, especially inside pictures. Trying to return it to sony but first have to mail it to their repair center. I have an old canon 4 pix that takes much higher quality images. If you care about picture quality, don't buy this camera."
4,Nice camera,"After a moderate research on the web I bought this camera. I was saw good reviews, nice features and thought it would be good value for money. My comments after I have used it a few times -* Picture quality is good, but main problem is it does not have any stability control, so even the slight shake of your hand may reduce the pcture quality drastically.* Picture taken in low light is good in clarity, but it seems a bit pixelized (even taken in the highest megapiels).* Video quality is also quite good for a digital camera* One thing amazed me - I accidentally dropped it twice from my hand once it was quite forceful fall, but the camera kept working fine! It reminded me of my previous Nikon, which was dropped once and never worked again :-(* LCD is big and goodI heard that the later models have picture stability control, with this feature this camera would definitely be a good buy for the price."
4,Great Product,"I bought the same camera in black. A great camera. It's small and can be fit in your pocket easy, although I would strongly suggest you buying a case for it. The case has gotten cheaper since I bought it. I do have to mention that I had a problem with the lens. On a random day, I recharged that battery and slide it back into the camera. The lens went in and out constantly when I turned it on, and meanwhile, the screen was displayed ""Accessing"" or something along that line. The warranty had ran out but the camera broke within 30 days after the warranty was out. So I called the Sony company just to see if they will repair it for me. They eventually made an accommodation for me and and repaired it for me a not charge. Although I did have to pay for shipping to the Sony repair center. When I got my camera back from the repair center they gave me a 90 days warranty.Over all, I am still very satisfied with it and the Sony company customer service."
1,Sony is trash!,"Six months after purchasing this camera the lens fails to open leaving me with a $200.00 (more when you consider memory stick and case) piece of junk. Google ""How to fix a stuck lens on a Sony DSC-W55"" and you will see what a common problem this is. My advice is to steer clear of all Sony products as they appear to care little about quality."
4,Great cost benefit product,"The pictures taken came out great so the movies (using the best quality).The only * are a few shots at night. Sometimes the flash and colors could work better, so the pictures would be brighterThe battery last for hundred shots."
4,camera,"it is a good camera overall, but the wheel changes to easily and you end up taking pictures on the wrong mode. also the mdoes are somewhat confusing but overall it is great."
4,Good camera for teens =),"As a teen, its cool when i can easily take pics of my friends and quickly upload them. This camera gives good pics of you even when you think u don't look so great that day. When I first got the Sony Cybershot, I was sooo excited because I researched about a lot and it took awhile before I could order it so it is definitely worth the wait. With the specific features that enhance snowy pictures, nightfall pictures, landscapes, and beach pictures, it is easy to look like a photographer without that much work in creating the perfect shot. Also, the black & white feature is great for an elegant pic. I absolutely reccommend this camera to teens!"
4,GREAT camera,This camera is amazing... for the price you pay the quality is fantastic and I would buy one again and again!
4,great gift,"After using other ready to shoot digital cameras, and not being happy with the quality of them, I was extremely happy to find this Sony camera. It is truely a ready to shoot camera, where I don't have to an expert to use. It will be my main camera from this point forward. The wife's happy too...."
4,"Excellent camera, excellent price","If you want a simple camera for your vacations, and you're not a professional but such a tourist who wants to record all its vacations memories, this is the perfect equipment for you."
4,DSC W55,expensive battery ... delivery of effortless & decent quality picture ... fits well those users who would content w/ a stylish camera having a solid build and a view finder
5,An America Fan,"For America fans like myself, this is a wonderful album. I totally enjoyed the new tunes and the flavor that they add to the christmas covers. Dewey and Gerry (with a little help from a friend)have added their melody from Tin Man to White Christmas and Horse with No Name to Winter Wonderland and it is great! As always their harmonies are superb and music is pleasent. I really liked this album (I like all of their stuff). A must album for the America fan!"
4,Excellent Background and Setting,"It's interesting to have a campaign set in the Asian lands of any world. Honor is key above the traditional good and evil. This Rokugan sourcebook excells at giving you a great setting for the adventures. Filled with politics and intrigue, as well as the traditional kill the monsters stuff. It really has something for everyone. Maybe it has too much detail, because it causes me to worry if I will remember everything on the fly. Take notes!"
2,not worth the 14.95,"The video is only 20 minutes long. Good information, but not worth 14.95 for 20 minutes."
3,From the Spook City website,"The long-awaited full length from New Jersey Mosh kings, Repercussion. This album is full of tempo changes and 2-step for all your dance needs. For fans of Clubber Lang, Shattered Realm, Death Before Dishonor."
