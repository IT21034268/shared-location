5,This stuff is really nice,"I received this as a gift. It IS outrageously expensive, but it leaves your skin so soft and supple. I don't know that I would pony up for this stuff on my own, but I really enjoy it."
5,Super Sweet!,I got this as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend. He is a huge Punisher fan and had been wanting this one for a while! Arrived quickly and carefully packaged! Thanks!
3,Slightly misleading subject title,"After reading The Great Dying, I realized that this wasn't such a bad book on the effects of the Great Plague that scourged through Europe during the mid-14th century. The author definitely knows her stuff and I found the book to be quite informative and interesting.However, I was bit surprised to read that this book really don't covered the plague in Dublin at all in any details. I was hoping that this book was some sort of micro-history of how one city was affected by the plague but instead, the city of Dublin was just a frame of reference to the plague. Much of the book dealt with the plague but along the European wide approach. I guess the author lacks sources to tell such a micro-history as the subtitle suggested.Still, I found the book to be decently written but I think the book's subtitle should be rewritten."
3,"Yikes! Tune it up, people.","Karajan's characteristic beauty comes through well. However, the intonation of the choir is sometimes not good. The opening of the Kyrie will give you a good example. You may be better served elsewhere."
5,A Family Favorite,I love this CD almost as much as my children do - the songs are hilarious and the tunes are catchy. I would highly recommend Underwater Land.
3,General overview of the sport,"This book is slick, well-written, and a good informative read. The photos are very well done and the presentation is very nice. What it is NOT is a guide to ""mastering"" the art (not that you'll read your way to mastery of any martial art). There is a good discussion of some techniques and combos, but much of the book is spent on subjects such as stretching and conditioning exercises, the various styles of kickboxing (low, full-contact, low kicks, Thai boxing, etc.), women in kickboxing, and a list of the various kickboxing associations.Some gratuitous information on defense against weapons is included at the end of the book. The techniques demonstrated will get you killed regardless of your skill as a kickboxer. Other than this thankfully short section, it's a good review of the world of kickboxing. Enjoy it."
1,used cars vhs comedy,For adults only! Nudity and sexual content is a bit more than younger viewers should watch. Too many instances of blasphemy to suit me or most anyone who are religious.That took much of the comedy out of the movie for me. There are plenty of cuss words to choose from and I don't see why they had to use the name of the High Preist and Saviour of the World to do it. I'm sure the movie is a classic in Hollywood but I should not have purchased it. Madcap Mania to be sure.The seller delivered the movie very quickly and it was in good condition. Thanks.
4,A twisted & funny movie,"I hadn't seen this movie in a few years when I decided to pick up a copy of the video. I had forgotten how funny it is, and how twisted too. The plot involved twin brothers (played by Jack Warden) who own competing car lots across the street from each other. One brother, Roy L. Fuchs, learns that a highway will soon be constructed where his lot stands. So he plots and schemes to gain control of his brother's lot so he can make lots of money. Enter Kurt Russell who is a slick, quick-witted con-artist (whose dream is to be a politician) working for the ""good"" brother. He sets events in motion to prevent Roy L. Fuchs from achieving his goal. This leads to a variety of riotous situations. The film can be a bit uneven at times but it's quirky appeal more than makes up for it."
5,Used Cars,An excellent DVD. Very funny.I was very satisfied with the clarity of the DVD. Very fast shipment on it.
5,The most fantastic movie ever made.,Non-stop comedy. Often copied never duplicated. Impeccably acted. Language may be a bit rough for prudes. Move over Gone with the Wind. The only reason this movie did not walk away with all the oscars is that it is comedy. Even out does Blazing Saddles. A TRUE CLASSIC.
4,interesting read,An interesting reveal of the inner workings of our great states institutes. I'm don't know if I'd recommend it for all though.
5,Wonderful,"This is a wonderful album and should be in the collection of everyone who cares about Lieder. I use to study how she works her magic with a song, and it is worth digging into a single piece to see how she does it."
1,why could the producers use the facts?!,"MOST DISSAPOINTED IN THIS STORY. Acting just adequate, photography fair, but story poor, poor. I wish I rented this dvd and not waiste good money on having it collect dust on my shelf.POOR, POOR Story.Beethoven lived a most unuseual life and the facts alone to the novice could be absolutly facinating!"
4,Great Affordable Walkabout Lens!!!,"This is a good general lens. I bought a Canon 40D body only. The kit lens was out of stock and I wasn't getting good enough reviews to wait around until it was available. I purchased this lens as my primary lens. I had read good reviews and it was well within the price range. The autofocus is quick and smooth and picture quality is very good-excellent. I think this is a great choice to replace a ""kit"" lens and not break the bank."
2,Ice Pick is cheaper,Don't waste your money purchasing punch. Using an icepick to punch hole has the same result. The punch's hole is identical and not much better than one made with an icepick.
4,Just what I needed,"The brass plate is not centered with the punches, nor do they contact flat with the plate. So for some of the punches it may need to be rotated to make a clean cut all the way through, or you can just pull the piece out (that is what I did for my belts). Other than that the punch worked fine, and as I hoped. I have a few more projects to use it for and I think that it will work fine for the random punching needs."
4,Works for what I wanted.,Needed to punch some holes in belts and this did the job. Takes a lot of pressure to punch holes in a thick belt but the handles held up and will live to punch another day.
3,Why get only 3 when you can have 5 for the same price!,"These old Black-and-White Tarzan films are in public domain -- none of the available prints are all that good.BUT, if you go here, you can get the same Tarzan films plus two more for about the same price in nice packaging. You can read my full review there:AMC: Tarzan of the Apes: CollectionHave a great day!!!"
5,"Unique, alive and delightful at every listening...","Pacifica is a work of great thoughtfulness and energy. Uplifting, real and direct. It is a unique and original album, from a unique and original artist. I have all three of Pia's albums and would buy a fourth without hesitation."
5,Perfect for DeWalt and other brands,"These nails work perfectly with my DeWalt D51275K 15 gauge angled finish nailer, and the size/shape of the reuseable plastic case they come in is handy for holding extra nails in the tool belt or even your back pocket.Not mentioned in the Amazon description is the following included with the nails: ""Fits SENCO SFN1, SFN30, SFN40; AccuSet A250FN; Craftsman 18432, 18442; DeWalt D51275K; Porter-Cable DA250A."" There are 700 nails in the pack. The DeWalt can be finickey about nails, and it definitely likes these.I purchased my nailer from Amazon, and at the time they were offering $25 off purchases over $199. To hit that number, the only thing I could think of was to get a variety of nails, so I added these AccuSet 1-1/2"" nails, along with a pack of 2"" nails and a pack of 2-1/2"" nails to the shopping cart. So I got variety of nail sizes that work good with my nailer practically for free. Can't beat that."
1,What a Crock of...,"I was very, very disappointed in this book, and in the seemingly intelligent people, including Tony Robbins, who recommended it. I don't know where Dr. Young got his degree, but his ideas are completely unscientific, something out of pre-20th century proto-science. This book apparently appeals to those who (a) flunked their high school biology classes and didn't make it quite as far as college, or (b) have a strong and paranoid need to believe everything ever discovered by the scientific ""establishment"" is totally mistaken, including all genetic research done in the past century.I can't recommend this book at all, a waste of money and time. Will only appeal to the extremely gullible or undereducated Tony Robbins cultists. Oh, to be fair, there are a few recipes that look like they may be good, if you have vegetarian leanings."
5,Magnifico - Incredibile - Stupefacente,We Italianos love our vegetables and we say bravo to Dr. Young for his magnifico research.Chow - Mila
1,"""They've been around for thousands of years""","But the film seems longer. Ooh, there are some cynics out there. The catapault was obviously hidden in pieces around the prison. Under pillows. In the latrine. Up the inmates left trouser legs. Up...other places. Behind the cigarette vending machine. Behind the poster of Rita Heyworth. Then they constructed it in er, a minute flat and er....Will the Special Edition have an alternative ending? Redford winches up the American flag. Then after a minute they take it down and someone puts up the Iraqi flag. End titles. Arabic music. Like it, centurion?"
2,three for the movie 2 for Redford acting,"I'm sorry, but Redford's acting style seems dated or something, he's just not believable. When the main character gives you this feeling, it's tough to enjoy the story. The rest of it's not bad, but I expected more somehow. I'll spare you the re-hash of the story.... If your on the fence and want to see Redford, by all means, just don't get your hopes up."
1,"Yes, this is a dud","1. I admit it, I did watch the whole DVD, mainly because I was bored and had nothing else to do. Otherwise, it's a 2 star movie--> entertaining enough to keep one watching, but lousy enough that most folks will be asking themselves ""Why am I wasting my time watching this nonsense?"" Basically the plot is just unrealistic that one can't get engaged in the film. Even a sci-fi movie has more probability of being realistic than this film, which makes one wonder, who in the world ever wrote this script?2. If you want an excellent prison type film--> Shawshank Redemption; enough said."
4,**THIS REVIEW IS ONLY FOR THE DVD**,"The extras on this DVD are great, im very sad this hasnt gotten more attention for a better DVD release, but it is all good right now. The extras include all:*Deleted Scenes with commentary by: Rod Lurie*HBO Special: Inside the Castle Walls*Commentary By Rod Lurie*Theatrical Trailer*Production Notes*Cast and Filmaker Bios"
1,Very Bad,Bad history and a bad movie all rolled into one. I could be a little more forgiving of the poor history lesson if the film had been a little more entertaining. If you want a great film that is historically accurate try God's and Generals.
3,Good movie,I thought the movie was a good pick up. The price was right and this film is pretty good. So if you have a Ps3 or a blu-ray player and are looking for films at a low price then pick it up.
5,Must See,"Great movie, DiCaprio learned how to act somewhere between titanic and Gangs, must see this one"
1,Very Overated,Totally unengaging characters and a boring plot.So bad that after the first DVD finished I couldnt be bothered to watch the second one.
2,What's the Point?,"That is all. I couldn't see any point to this movie, especially with the ""fast forward"" trick at the end to bring us up to a present day NYC skyline in which Scorsese delusionally decided to include the World Trade Center towers.Oh, and since when did a performance that barely made it to ""Captain Hook"" Cartoonish level warrant any praise at all?The ONLY part of this movie that was interesting/compelling had nothing to do with the prurient sex and violence. It was, instead, Boss Tweed, and his nonchalant quips about getting bread and soup out the docks the morning after the murderous draft riots because, ""We're losing a lot of votes here tonight.""THAT is all."
2,A lot to chew on...,"Well, I'm a big fan of Scorsese's work. And while this film has a brilliant performance by Daniel Day-Lewis as Bill the Butcher, the film as a whole is a tough one to enjoy. It's far too long and aspires to be a sort of historical document to this period in New York. The core story - the relationship between Bill the Butcher and Vallon (Leonardo DiCaprio) - is very promising, but Scorsese seems willing to take up every available tangent and in the process delivers a tiring, disjointed film. Even as the film reaches it's climax we find we've got another twenty minutes to go. Scorsese is one of the finest filmmakers of our time, but he may have been too close to this story.This is arguably the best work from actor Daniel Day-Lewis and the film may be worth watching on that basis alone. But I'd have a hard time sitting through it again."
2,DAY-LEWIS RULES !!!!!,"THis guy proved once again who is the best in his game!! Man, more than five years aways from the screens and he comes back in such a memorable peformance, contending for the OSCAR, in a movie that portrays nothing more than a big-budgeted and old and banal history of revenge.It's a shame that himself has declared that he does not like movies,; he prefers theater much more. He's the best."
3,It's ok,Like the historical setting and Daniel Day Lewis is excellent. Didn't like DiCaprio or Diaz. This movie is entirely too long.
4,Pleasantly surprised,"Having owned the standard DVD and from some reviewers comments I wasn't expecting the Blu-Ray to be top notch, well I was pleasantly surprised. The film looked better than I expected, yes edge enhancement is overdone in some scenes, but overall it looked great.The surround sound was excellent. As to the film, the first two thirds is great, the last seems overloaded and rushed, with too much historical detail, a lot of it could have been made into another film. I enjoyed the film more this time around."
3,NOT AS BAD,"I did not expect much from this film because I don't like the cast much, and the story is also not within the purview of my own interests. Usually I avoid things with stories that don't have much redeeming value to me personally, but in this case, I thought I might as well watch. The DVD fell into my hands, and I figured it could not hurt. I can say I was impressed with the film... grand scale, interesting... but overall, it seemed a bit much. This is why I just think it was average or a bit above average. The grand scale in essence was too over the top for my liking, but I did find myself entertained and engaged in the story enough to stick with it through the whole length. It was gory, bloody and dramatic, also not my favorites, but I think the film is worth seeing."
2,Martin Scorsese this is your style ? i don`t think so,"If there's one word that I can use to describe this long-in-waiting film by master filmmaker Martin Scorsese, it is ""disappointing"".the biggest problem wasn't its runtime as much as it was the story, which felt like it was trying to appease too many agendas at the same time, and ended up not truly fulfilling any of them. Is this film about gangs in New York? Sort of...but not entirely. Is this movie about a love affair between an angry young man and a cute pick-pocket? Sort of...but not entirely. Is it about revenge, is it about the history of New York during the late 1800s? Sort of. Lots of stuff is kind of covered in this movie, but none of it goes into much detail,If you're going to make a 180-minute long movie and expect us to invest ourselves in the lead character, why not show more of his anger and thirst for revenge (see THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO for a great example of this)"
4,A Great Movie that SHOULD Have Swept at the Box Office,"Scorcese's newest movie ranks up there with the likes of Goodfellas and Casino. At first, I questioned the entertainment that could be involved in a 3 hour movie that starred Leonardo DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz, whether or not Scorcese directed it. Trust me, after the first scene of gang warfare where Liam Neeson and Daniel Day Lewis engage in battle, it won't matter. The three hours go by fast as you consistently feel the climactic battle looming ahead. The movie was overall great, but the ending is extremely corny. As far as acting goes, Daniel Day Lewis is superb and definetely deserves an Oscar nod. DiCaprio delivers a good performance, but I would not consider it Oscarworthy. Cameron Diaz is alright, but her accent feels off although it quickly fades in your mind. ... Anyway, definetely see this movie."
1,Garbage,"This is, if not the worst movie ever made, then probably the worst movie ever to receive a bunch of Academy Award nominations (10!). It's excessively violent and ludicrously overacted throughout. Daniel Day Lewis hams it up shamelessly. Leonardo diCaprio and Cameron Diaz can't even have sex without violence. It would have been a real shame if this atrocity had won Best Picture. Maybe the Academy gave Scorsese all these nominations because they felt guilty for not giving him enough awards for his genuinely outstanding achievements, i.e., Raging Bull and Goodfellas. It's a shame to see really talented people come up with such trash. Scorsese couldn't have done worse if he had collaborated with Oliver Stone on a sequel to Natural Born Killers."
3,gangs of new york,talks about the prohibition era back in the 1860's good movie a little bit of violence. I loved Leonardo DiCaprio in this movie he's really good actor.
3,Not for everyone taste.,"I enjoyed this movie a lot, even recognizing some of its big flaws.The best part is Daniel Day-Lewis. It's a pity that him seldom works making movies. I wish he did more movies. He's one of the best actors that EVER lived.The rest of the cast is also good, but simply does not have much material to work with. Cameron Diaz's character is lost in the middle. DiCaprio did his best, but, once again, the writers did not offer to him a good script.Also great are the scenarios and the historic background. I mean, it's just a background, don'pt expect a history lesson here. It's like TITANIC, foe example, where Cameron used a hystorical background to tell a love story. Here, Scorcese used history to talk about the old cliche of revenge, the diffrence being that he got enthusiasthic about his movie and really tried to pass a message.Good movie, it could have been better, but, I'm not a director, just a consumer!"
3,Just So So,"After all the hype I thought I'd give this a viewing. The film was entertaining, but certainly not earth moving.With its share of violence and odd characters this is worth a viewing, but nothing classic by any means..."
2,"violent, ugly film, just so disappointing","This was pushed as THE film of the year. Since I love history, and this is based on historical fact, and it was loaded with a powerhouse cast, I thought wow...Then I saw it and I said wow...but with a different inflection.This film was brutal, an ugly film that was an exercise in wallowing in violence with nothing to redeem the film. Cameron Diaz and Leonardo DiCaprio are miscast, completely. Diaz's role seems so unclear, like they said hey, let's stick Diaz in here for star power. DiCaprio, usually a very talented actor, looks like a little boy trying to play big boy and worse, his performance was so dull as if we walked through the whole film. At time, his efforts are near comical. Daniel Day-Lewis turned in a stunning performance, but nearly stomach churning at times. Liam Neeson, another fine actor is there for a thankless near cameo role.Sorry, for the money that went into this film, it's such a disappointment."
3,Aucun Sous-titrage Franais ! ! !,Et la Langue de Molière - Balzac - Dumas et Hugo . . .Elle compte donc vraiment pour du Beurre ?
4,See it for Daniel Day-Lewis,"See this movie for one of the best acting performances ever.Daniel Day-Lewis is nothing short of amazing in his portrayal of Bill the Butcher. The best way I can describe it, is that he seemed to be acting with his entire body - the look of pure evil in his eyes, the way he held his head, the way he used his mouth, the way he handled the knives, the way he walked, the accent (what an old New York accent must have sounded like). For an actor to have that much concentration and control almost seems impossible. If he does not win the Oscar for Best Actor, I will personally boycott the Academy Awards show from now on. Acting does not GET any better."
3,Disgustingly impressive,"Or impressively disgusting, take your pick. After watching this movie you grow to despise Bill the butcher so much that its jarring to realize while watching Daniel Day Lewis in the bonus features that it really was all an act. Adding to the intense realism of the storytelling is the incredible movie set built in Rome's Cine Cita movie lot in only 5 months.Scorcese's storytelling is revolting but then you think this(or something close to it) really is part of American history. And as corrupt as politicians are now, as bleak as life today may seem, it's nowhere near as horrible as life in this NYC slum during the mid 19th century.It is a monumental cinematic achievement. Daniel Day Lewis gives an amazing performance. But the overall effect is just overwhelming in a bad way. The violence is over the top."
1,"Refund, please???","...Can't believe I paid good money for this atrocity. A huge fan of Leo and Daniel-Day, I disliked (the nicest word I can write) them both intensely in this violence-filled mess. I spoke with a young man who recommended it to me (telling me he had seen it THREE times!!!) Maybe it's a ""guy thing,"" because I could barely watch ""the whole thing."" This DVD is going in a box to Good Will!!"
3,"""Part 2 On Disc 2"" Seriously ??","With all due respect to the movie(The only reason I can't go below 3 stars), the movie AND special features being split evenly between two discs was a disappointment. One would think that when purchasing a 2-disc special edition of a movie, that disc one would contain the feature film, and perhaps any commentaries, and disc 2 would contain all of the special features. One would think. As a result, swapping out disc one and disc two is necessary to watch the movie in its entirety.I love the film, and give it 5 stars, and the special features are sufficient, but feel like I made the wrong purchase since the film is not contained on one dvd."
2,Double disc disaster,"The movie is awesome!! I give the movie 5 stars.I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend, and he was a little disappointed. I guess I didn't see where it said that the movie is on 2 disc. You watch the first couple hours and then get up and go put in the second disc to watch the ending of the movie. Thought that technology had gotten us past that, but not for this movie."
1,Attrocious,"I haven't seen a movie this bad in years. Yikes. You almost have to be doing it on purpose to get it to be this bad. That's what's scary. I couldn't even finish watching it, it was so horrible. And it had such pretensions of greatness. Oh! Spare yourself."
2,A Film With Overdone Stereotypes and Cliches,"Tale of survival and vengeance in the ethnically divided burroughs of 1860s New York where Leonardo DiCaprio seeks to avenge his father's killer and gang chief played by Daniel Day-Lewis.Certainly Scorcese brings out the smell of the tensions of the time, however, the acting and backdrops fail to bring any flavor to the story. The latter are too melodramatic and two-dimensional to bring the movie out of its Hollywood stereotype formula. Daniel Day Lewis plays his role well but the script and character is more archetypical than anything else; the characters psyche and motives aren't well explored. With so much of the film focusing on gangs and strife, one wonders why Cameron Diaz' character is included the story. The movie also has serious historical flaws as to events and the prevailing attitudes of the day.In the end, you feel as if you just watched an average blood-fest movie and not much else."
2,Ridiculously long and over-rated.,"I didn't like this movie at all. It was at least 2 hours way too long and so boring I almost fell asleep a bunch of times. I do agree that the visual effects of the movie are amazing, but that doesn't save the movie at all. I can't believe that this movie earned all the hype that it got. The story is basically Leonardo Dicaprio grows up to avenge the murder of his father which he witnessed. The movie could have EASILY been made into a two hour film - it didn't have to be an ""epic masterpiece"". I was really disappointed. I won't be watching it again. Huge waste of time."
3,If only Leonardo DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz could be extracted from this film ...,"Those two dirty blondes were lousy in this movie. On the plus side, DDL was incredible and really made ""LEO"" look bad by comparison. Whenever this movie plays on cable, I try to just watch DDL's beautiful beautiful performance and his AMAZING accent. His speech about being an American should be a ring tone."
5,THE BEST MOVIE OF 2002!,"Gangs of New York was the best movie of 2002 and thebest movies of all time!Daniel Day-Lewis should have wonbest actor! This movie was a lot better then Chicago. Somepeople didn't like it because they said it was mostly violence,but it isn't just a movie where it has all violence and no plot.I don't like Leonardo DiCaprio but he did a pretty good job.If you want to find out about a rarely discussed part of historyor just want to see an amazing movie Gangs of New York isdefinitely worth seeing!"
1,"I love the actors, but this was bad!!!","Have had this movie in my collection for more than 8 years and we finally decided to watch it last night.To quote my 13 year old: ""Well we won't get those 3 hours of our life back.""I kept waiting for the movie to get better and it never did.It was a period piece I understand, and I wonder if it is accurate in its depiction of the time.No matter what, I didn't like it or did I think it was entertaining. In any way.I like the actors. DeCaprio is one of my favorites. Lewis is always good, but I have seen this performance before in There Will Be Blood. Total over the top psycho. And Cameron Diaz was (in my opinion) not good for the role she played.The hype on the DVD cover which states it was nominated for 10 Academy Awards is deceiving. It was not good."
2,It Had potential too,"I can Not put into words how much i wanted to like it but, Scorsese just didnt show how life was like in that period and the movies plot was too cliche. the charachters had no charachter and dont get me started on the accents. the only decent performance(and this may be due to the director) were Daniel Day-Lewis and Liam Neeson."
4,Great Album,This is an album that requires more than one listen. They go against everything that music is today but do it in an easy laid back way. What is rare with this album is the fact that you can hear that the band is enjoying themselves and just focused on making good music. Let's be honest with ourselves and admit that no band today is completely original. Every band adopts characteristics from bands before them. If Dr. Dog chose to emulate any band they chose the best; The Beatles. There is nothing about this album that I don't absolutely love.
4,Good concise discussion on land navigation,"Well written, well illustrated guide to general land navigation. Also teaches how-to navigate without a compass. Book includes a compass-on-a-card that can be carried in a wallet and used for survival situations. Excellent for beginners and intermmediate navigators. I liked the graphic illustrations and the illustrations of how to use a map with a compass.The only negative I found was the lack of mention that the magnetic declination changes each year. If you have an old map, the declination value can be off significantly."
5,LOVED IT,"Reading some other comments, I am somewhat baffled by the opinion that this book has too much technical information on jade. THIS BOOK IS ABOUT JADE. THIS SERIES IS ABOUT GEMSTONES. For Lowell to leave out the technical information would take most of the validity away from the story/plot. Also, to say that the romance between Kyle and Lianna was rushed = this is not strictly a romance novel. I for one, enjoyed the Donovan series very much because it is the perfect mixture of mystery and romance. Not a mind-numbing mystery, not a trite romance. The best of both world. The story is extremely interesting and I read it in two nights, couldn't put it down."
2,seems to be a recurring theme,"When it arrived, the box was open and torn. As soon as we opened the box the rest of the way, the top of the fridge was very obviously dented in, we're talkin a good inch and a half dented. But since it's for our bar area we decided to keep it. It has a lot of space and gets cool quickly, but does make a bit of noise. I probably wouldn't buy from this company again though. For it to be that damaged when it arrived doesn't bode well for durability."
2,Great for the money,Fridge is big and great for the money but the hinge front arrived vusablt cracked
3,Check contents!,"Product is as described, but note the picture carefully - the terminal wire has spades, not a 2.5mm stereo jack. This means you will need to wire your own plug if using with the Bachmann Power Pack and Speed Controller. I found this out after receiving the product."
5,Awesome,"I didn't by this product from Amazon, but it is fantastic. I am a sweaty person, and I often smell a little ripe by the end of the day. I decided that since my antiperspirant/ deodorant wasn't doing the trick, I may as well give this a shot. After using this, I am convinced that my antiperspirant was actually making me sweat MORE. With the Crystal deodorant, Not only do I smell good all day, I sweat less now. I LOVE this product. I will never go back."
4,Buy it at the drugstore!,I'm not sure why anyone would buy this on Amazon when you can go to any drugstore and purchase this product for $3-4 each. This is an incredible mark up for something so easily found elsewhere.
4,Overall a good melodic death album,"First of all while Immortal Souls are described as being a cross between In Flames and Children of Bodom, they aren't nearly as good as either of those two bands. My main complaint with the cd in my opinion, is that the vocals sound terrible. For some reason they just don't fit in very well with the instruments and they sound too raspy and not forcefull enough. The instruments all sound really good on here with the guitars standing out the most. Another problem I had with this cd is that the whole ""wintermetal"" gets old rather quickly. Overall this is a good cd thats worth adding to your collection and hopefully Immortal Souls will continue to grow into their sound a bit more for their next release."
5,Gothenberg Metal at it's finest,"Immortal Souls is easily one of the best metal bands of all time. They are commonly referred to as black metal or meliodic death metal, but that is not the case here. They are a Gothenberg Metal. They are so sweet, every sing song is amazing! If you have any clue or any taste, you will buy this CD right now, or be left behind by one of the finest metal bands of our time. The beautiful melodies carry each track and each track delivers. Everwinter is absolutely incredible and so is sacrifice. those two songs you can checkout at facedown records website. Definately a must buy!"
5,elemis skin care is wonderful,my face has never been softer. a dermatologist even noticed how wonderful my pores look....i highly recommend this product...it's the best....
3,I can't believe they are charging this much for this movie.,"I have loved Rutger Hauer since I saw Ladyhawke and will watch almost anything with him in it. We really like this movie but there is no way I would give over $15 for it. We have watched it over and over on VHS! I wanted to replace it with DVD. Although it is classic, it is not worth the prices being charged - especially when there are better Rutger movies out there going for a lot less."
4,Still the best!,"If you are a Rutger Hauer fan like I am, then you will love this movie!Yes, it has hokey Dialog, Yes, some of the acting is wooden, Yes, some of the jokes are lame enough to make you run screaming into the night while holding your nose...but this is Rutger Hauer!!!Anyway, The action is superb enough to keep you on the edge of your seat, and Rutger Hauer puts forth his usual excellent job of making you wonder how he hasn't yet been committed. If you want a great bad guy or a gritty hero...he is the man!The special effects are not stellar, but the way the lighting is set and the mood will make you want to watch this movie all the way through. Kim Cattral puts forth an interesting effort, but to be honest I think a new name starlet would have been better cast in this role.See the movie...it's well worth it!"
3,Good Action for Hauer Fans,"Fans of movies like Dolph Lundgren's ""I Come in Peace"" or Rutger Hauer fans will want to catch this one. Plenty of action, decent acting, some comedy, and fairly decent story and music. When the city becomes flooded and bodies that are badly ripped up start showing up, Unorthodox detective Harley Stone is called in to investigate the cause. Only two problems, he has to have a partner on the case played by Neil Duncan, which he doesn't want, and the killer is an alien. Add in a delectable girlfriend played by Kim Cattrall and you have a nice afternoon matinee. This may not have the depth of movies he has done like ""Blade Runner"", but it sure is more fun like ""Wedlock"" or ""Blind Fury""."
2,Okay Sci-fi,"Not a great movie. I remember I was so eager to see this movie in 1992. What a big let down! You only see bits and pieces of this serial killer terrorizing London. Only in this last five minutes do we get to see the monster in all its glory. Pretty neat make up. A better alternative is Stephen Norrington's ""Death Machine"""
1,A cure for Insomnia,"I give this movie 1 star because I can't go any lower. This whole thing is a mess from start to finish, confusing, and quite frankly boring. Not one outstanding moment in this piece of garbage. The alien at the end is not scary in the least, and Rutger Hauer, a fine actor, cannot begin to save this. Buy one of the Aliens films instead, or if you must see Rutger, definitely buy Ladyhawke."
4,A great story with characters to care about,"Having finished all of Ellis Peters' Brother Cadfael mysteries, I've been searching around for another mystery (hopefully a series) set in the past. What a joy when my sister-in-law shared Shinju with me. I was captured right from the beginning and held all the way. Some of the critical comments in the other reviews are probably justified but I guess I appreciated a great story and characters I found myself caring about...even the ""villians"". I'm about to start Bundori and look forward to my next Japanese journey. Thank you, Ms. Rowland!"
3,"An OK read, but I wish it were better","I came across this book because it was mentioned on the web along with the R.H.Van Gulik Judge Dee Chinese mystery novels, which I adore (and all of which are still in print). Shinju is a good quick read, but I did skim bits, like the repeated ruminations about duty and so on. The book focuses too much on Sano: there really are no other characters of any depth. This is also more a thriller than a mystery, since the villain is never seriously in doubt. I was also disappointed that the book was not weirder than it is, and had no intriguing side-plots. For an example of truly weird Japanese fiction, with many elements of a mystery novel, read Haruki Murakami's books. Perhaps Rowland gets more imaginative in her subsequent books, which I will probably still read, if I happen upon them."
3,Mixed feelings,"What to say about this one? Exotic setting (17th century Japan), interesting main character (Sano Ichiro, a samurai lawman dedicated to finding out the truth), a solid plot (will the valiant detective be able to solve two murders in a corrupt society that just wants to cover them up). I really was sold on it when I first heard of this book.Unfortunately, this is another first novel with some big stylistic problems. What was good about it was good enough that I will probably try the next book in the series, but the writing style--passive action scenes and a superabundance of description--so weighed down my enjoyment that I had to put the book down at a certain point and read other things for awhile before I could return to it and finish.But what was good about it...her characters are fully fleshed people. Even minor characters resonate. The plot was complicated and intriguing, but not at all hard to follow, and some of those passages of description were quite beautiful."
4,"Useful tool, consume with moderation","The structure of the Nutshell is well done, clear.Sometimes it lacks precisions, grahics of how the concepts have to interact would be helpful to better understand the structure of the core crimes outlined.The most important recent cases are not integrated."
3,The camera I received does not have Caption function either,"I have also received the worng model. I was really upset when I noticed that ""Caption"" was not on the model that I purchased. I immediately called the customer support number, explained the difference to them. They transferred me to their shipping dept. I spkoe with a rep. that informed the replacement will be the correct model with the ""Caption"" option. The replacement camera is currently being shipped. I sure hope they can get the correct model, this camera is at a great price."
4,raid on truman,I found this book to be very enjoyable. It is like under siege but without the bad acting of steven segal. The book draw you in and made you want to continue reading.
4,Raid on Truman,"It is good to see the snipes getting some glory. A little fact checking would have helped, but it was an entertaining way to spend a few hours."
4,Outstanding Techno Thriller - True To Life!,"After 18 years in the U.S. Navy, it's about time someone has written about the men who run the heart of a ship. Mr. Campbell shows how a true sailor acts in desparate sitiuations. Definitely one of the best. Look out Bond and Clancy."
3,A useful book for beginners,"This is an interesting book for complete beginners. The instructions show the reader how to assemble a custom made guitar from popular manufacturers parts. There are no photos, only drawings. The wiring diagrams appear to be quite useful. When used in conjunction with a proper parts catalogue like Stewart-Macdonald's, it would appear that the reader should be able to construct his or her own custom built electric guitar."
5,love it,"I am studying Hindi at my university, taught by a visiting Fulbright scholar. She was expecting to teach 'heritage' students, and was therefore unprepaired for the 4 non-heritage students who registered for her class. No curriculum, no texts. She very successfully taught us to read and write Devanagari script, but we were all struggling with how to learn grammer and with beginning to speak with understanding. I was so relieved to find Usha Jain's book. It makes sense! And it is so well laid out for the beginning Hindi student. I recommend it highly, and I look forward to future texts from this very gifted teacher."
3,3.5 - Works well on the RnB tip anyway,"The amount of production emanating from this man in any given year is extraorinary. On this LP, Spinna amasses both hip hop and rnb artists with a sprinkling of jazz talents. The result is predictably mixed. A sure shot banger, Jean Grae paired with Apani B Fly is sadly mired in a mediocre beat. The same can be said for the Jigmastas' track. ""Tune You Out"" f/ Rise is tolerable, but the bottom line is that these tracks pale to the much more funkier rnb songs. ""Idols"" w/ the sultry Vinia Mojica works splendidly (if BBE were only sage enough to sign her on as the label's preeminent female vocalist). Likewise for the tracks with Soullive, Angela Johnson and Shaun Escoffery. These handful of songs are a testament to what production Spinna is capable of and mesh well. Despite the hour plus duration of ""Here to There"", I was expecting more quality hip hop tracks, which Spinna is normally adept at crafting."
3,"I preferred ""Can't Take Me Home""","Pink writes some great lyrics on this album. I love some songs, however Pink has taken a giant step away from the way she used to express herself, and I loved her R&B style. Pink gets personal, and it seems almost as if she contradicts her views from the last album. ""Just Like A Pill"", ""18 Wheeler"", ""Respect"", and ""Misery"" are great tracks on this album, however, once I listened to them once or twice, I never really again had the itch to play them. Also, Pink denies the power of her own voice and doesn't always sound as good as she usually does. Probably with time, she will begin to have the talent to combine storytelling and vocal power, but for now, it seems it's one or the other."
5,very good cd,this is a very good cd but a few swear words. i loved it. very good beat and rythym. a must have. GO PINK
5,nice,"I can honestly say that all of the songs on this CD are worth listening to. I didn't like Pink before, but this CD is pretty cool."
5,Missundaztood,"I definately had hesitations about buying this album. In fact, I went to the store 3 different times, picked it up, and then put it back before I finally bought it. I don't care for pop music very much, and was afraid this CD would be kind of like Britney. Ick. But I am so glad that I decided to get it. It is great. Her voice is so strong and I love the bluesy feel on most of the songs. I definately recommend this to anyone."
1,BORING!!!BORING!!!BORING!!!,She is just another trend like britney spears or eminem.The people who work with her in making her music ask her to appear as a tough weird chick in order to appeal to a certain demography of people in order to sell records.I almost fell asleep listening to the record because it is so bland and boring.Her voice is mediocre and the sound is too comercial for me.She has a real attitude problem and seems to be a manhating lesbian.PEOPLE PASS ON THIS ONE!!!
2,Yep... Another Punk Wannabee,"From ""Just Like a Pill"" to ""Get the Party Started"" Pink shows that she's a punk. (Or at least she thinks she is) Although, Pink's first C.D was awesome, this one is a waste of money. Pink thinks she's ""all that"" by tatoos and black hair, but when it comes to singing, she is definetley not all that. My favorite song on the C.D is ""Respect"" cuzit has a nice beat, all the other songs are full of loudness. Especially Misery. With the title, you'd think it's a great soft and full of misery song but with Steven Tyler's voice in it, how can it be that? It's pretty sad if there's only one good song on the C.D. Well, all I can say is, better luck on your next C.D Pink. (Leave out the punk images)"
3,Some good songs,"I absolutely loved PINK's previous album (1999-2000?).Her old album used to lift my spirit a little and get me all energized and ready for workout or a haivng a good time. In my opinion, this was not an improvement. There are too many ""slow songs"" (for my taste that is). There are two, maybe three songs on this CD that I listen to (including the very catchy song ""I'm coming up so you better get this party started"", but overall I was not very impressed."
4,Some great songs on this cd,"I loved some of the songs that never got radio airplay. The thing I like the most is Pink uses so many different styles, it's a huge change from one song to the next. Keeps it interesting."
4,Missundaztood,"The album I choose to review is Pink's Missundaztood. The reason I choose this album was because I like her music a lot. Her songs are really good. The words in her songs have a strong meaning in them and it represents who she is. That's one of the things I like about her music is that she writes about stuff that means something to her. Some of her songs represent what her life was like growing up.As you all know she sings pop, and that's the kind of music I like to listen to. And if you like pop music then you will love Pink's Missundaztood. My favorite songs on her CD are ""Missundaztood,"" ""Don't Let Me Get Me,"" ""Just Like a Pill,"" and ""Get the Party Started,"" are really good songs. And if you like any of these songs then you should go out and buy this CD."
5,Totally Missundztood from her 1st record!,"This is pretty much a great CD. Except for the fact that some of the songs sound the same, the best ones are ""Get The Party Started"", ""Don't Let Me Get Me"", and ""Just Like A Pill""."
2,BEWARE!!!!,"As the amazon.com reviewer points out, this CD is NOTHING like Pink's first. If you loved that one, as I did, you most likely will NOT love this one. Her infectious dance/R&B songs on the first disc were a whole lotta fun. This time out, Pink wants to be a rock chick, and her efforts in that regard do absolutely nothing for me. That doesn't mean you won't like the new disc; just try and hear it before buying it so you don't make the same mistake I did!"
2,Where's Pink?,"I loved her first cd,with the R&B feeing through out the album.This one is different. it is mostly rock based and some of the songs didn't really fit the album nor her style. i know she is trying different directions in music but this is not pink. ""Can't take me home"" album has more emotions rather than all that junk britney stuff."
3,Not bad,Not a bad early CD for Pink. A combination of upbeat and slow songs brings a good contrast. However there isn't much variety in the songs causing the listener to become bored with it.
2,beautiful failure... that review is very accurrate,I would have to agree with the person that left that comment. I was disappointed with this board. I thought that it would be more like a ouija board only in that it would spell out answers to me. Instead this board is more like playing a game. I was very disappointed in this product.
2,"fun, but not accuate","I recived this as a gift. It is fun to play, but not accuate. The booklet that came with it was printed upside down. So when I want to look something up I have to remember that."
1,A Waste of energy and money....very dissapointed!,"I waited patiently for this board to arrive, I have used the Angel (ouja type) board and loved it, also have used the Oracle cards by Doreen Virtue and was thrilled with the accuracy. I was hoping this board would give me difinitive answers and I could use it alone, unlike the other Angel board. Well every single time I've used it it has been inaccurate. Save your money."
2,Misspelling,"I hesitate to order this cookbook because the main word in the title is misspelled: it should be ""parrilla""."
2,Seriously out of date.,"When we last visited Hungary in 2011, this book was already listing hotels and restaurants that were no longer extant. Having kept up with friends over there, we know it's now seriously out of date. Even a number of important streets and subway stations in Budapest have changed their names, and the list of changes in secondary cities and towns are huge. Good as this series has been, it needs a serious revision to be useful in the future. If you want to stick with Budapest, go with the Lonely Planet Budapest guide, but if you're looking for something better on Hungary in general, look elsewhere."
1,Poor construction,"Basically, the steel on the inside is not padded properly to keep it from digging into your toes. These shoes just kill your feet. Probably the worst pair of steel-toed workboots I ever bought. Will never buy shoes again on Amazon. You need to try shoes on before you buy. I'm disgusted with them and tired of hassling with shipping stuff back. Some purchases work on the web, this is not one of them. Too bad Amazon sells this kind of junk on their website. Lesson learned, you don't have to tell me twice...."
1,Disappointing fit,"I knew better than to buy Propet walkers, as previous styles I've purchased do not run true to size. But a pink sneaker in AAAA width? I couldn't resist. Stupid me. The label says AAAA, but the shoe fits like a AA at best, perhaps even a plain old B/medium width. In the past, I've had problems with lengths -- a 10 is short, while a 10 1/2 is long. Even with thickly cushioned socks, this shoe is far too wide. And it's not even that cute. The heel screams ""old lady,"" even in the eyes of my 89-year-old mom. I don't care for the finish -- it's not a matte pink but a sparkly one more appropriate for an evening shoe than a sneaker."
5,great shoe,"This shoe is so light weight. Unfortunately, it didn't fit me. I must be between sizes. Do give it a try."
1,Dull book,I could never get into the book. It was not about espionage as I had expected. The writing did not pull me in.
2,Boring by nature,"I am half way through this book and NOTHING has happened. The First 100 pages can best be described as a day in the life of a school boy. The main character is part of a phone scam and then gets turned on to applying for the British Secret Service. That's about as exciting as the book gets!!! I will probably not waste my time in finishing this book, I will move on to a Daniel Silva book and be immersed in characters and plots that give your pulse a kick start!"
5,This book reminds you that you're not alone,"Of all the books I have read this one stands out more than the others, I laughed, cried, and was able to relate to alot of the stories published. It's a book for everyone; mothers, fathers, single people all can be touched. Everytime life gets tough and I think there is just no end to this madness I remember that God loves us and he is always going to be there through it all."
5,The most heartwarming and wonderfully tuoching book.,Tis book is the most heartwarming wonderfully touching books of all time. I absoluty love the inspirational stories told that could lift anybodies spirits when they are feeling down. =+)
3,generic maiden-influenced metal,"My considered opinion is that this is not Steel Prophet's best album. They have gone for a softer metal sound that is probably too laid-back to be considered ""power metal."" It is essentially a modern update of the traditional Iron Maiden-like traditional ""heavy metal"" sound. I recommend ""Dark Hallucinations"" above ""Messiah,"" and many other power metal bands above recent Steel Prophet (Nocturnal Rites, Edguy, Helloween, Rage, Blind Guardian, Therion to name just a few). It is a shame that Steel Prophet, once signing to a ""major"" label and getting good production, have not continued the intricate progressive power metal style of their very early releases."
5,good for teaching ESL,"The book is based on a well-known jingle.It is written in a simple pattern which ESL students can easily follow.It is good practice in the interrogative form.It repeats the word ""cookies,"" so it is good for a lesson on plural nouns. If you are teaching Asian students, this is a generous bonus."
4,A Plot To Assassinate The President,"Elliott Roosevelt has written a series of mysteries in which his mother, the First Lady, solves one or more murders. Each gives us a mystery plus a sense of the White House and popular culture during the Roosevelt administration in the 1930-1940 era. In this story, it is 1943. The allies and the axis powers are fighting desperately around the world. Winston Churchill and his Generals have come to the White House secretly to plan the invasion of France. But upstairs, a policeman finds the body of one of the President's aides, murdered in the Lincoln Bedroom. Realizing that this must be kept secret because of the conference, Eleanor Roosevelt sets out to solve the killing. With the aid of a Secret Service agent and a Washington Police detective, she uncovers and thwarts a plot to assassinate the President. The book is enjoyable, more for the flavor of 1943 than for its simple plot, but it is a smooth-reading story."
4,Brads,These brads work so well. It is a grea finish tool andthe brads are just what I needed. This will be most helpful.Thanks
5,nails for ryobi -nail gun,"nice to have nails when you need them. have to say the size diffrence is nice to have, they work great for screened in porch with strips!! very easy to use."
5,Great product.,"Not much to say about brads other than if they work or not and all included sizes have worked perfectly in my Ridgid 2 1/8"" nailer. I bought four packs and plan to buy more Sencos when they are gone."
5,Great Starter Pac,"My husband just got to get started, no wait ( that's important in our home business). With the rang of the selection it's right on hand for any use."
4,Works great clear audio,"The audio quality is great, although I had a bit of a problem getting them to work with older cables. I had to use electrical tape to keep them connected to the older cables.Otherwise it works great."
2,More gimmick than substance,"Largely a waste of time, and unless you like to look like an idiot turning the book sideways and diagonally and upside-down to read passages that often amount to no more than paragraph or line per page, then stay far away from it! Oh, the story (the main story about the house itself) is somewhat interesting, but is far too disjointed to keep the reader's interest. The blurb by Bret Easton Ellis on the back is a hint and a half to keep far away from it: if I were Thomas Pynchon I'd slap Mr. Ellis very hard for daring to use my name in comparison with Danielewsky."
3,Expedition Aborted,"I made it halfway through Chapter 9 before bailing on this pretentious literary artefact. Every time the story seems to be going somewhere exciting, we're dumped into a maze (yeah, we *get* it already) of digressions and intrusions. At some point, the narrator's intrusions begin to read like Letters to Penthouse. It isn't offensive (that might have actually held my interest); it's just terribly banal. Every woman this guy meets is some kind of boring two-dimensional bang-doll. When something outwardly intriguing finally began happening with the main story, and I realized I didn't care, it was time for me to give up. It's not that there weren't some pay-offs along the way. The dusty discourse on echoes eventually ties into the story in a clever way. Maybe everything is in that vein and I'm giving up to soon. But giving up I am. May your exploration take you further than mine did."
1,Overrated Self-Referential Time Waster,"Danielewski is a little like ""musician"" Puff Daddy: he really does very little work on his own but is an expert at appropriating ideas from the avant-garde and then rearranging them in a comfortable, easily consumable form. ""House of Leaves"" has more in common with Stephen King than it does with Ballard, Burroughs, Poe, or even more radical artists who use the methods MD steals, like Samuel R. Delaney.If having to turn a book while you read seems ""cutting edge"" or ""daring"" to you, then jump in. Otherwise, you should go buy some Jeff Vandermeer or China Mieville -- two artists less concerned with empty stylistic tricks and more focused on producing quality literature."
5,Supremely creepy,There isn't a better book out there for intricate creepiness. The design format and the details left unrevealed make this a favorite.
4,worth the time it takes to read it,"This is by far one of the weirdest books I have ever read, but it was worth it. I feel it ends a little suddenly, but Mark Z. Danielewski is an amazing writer the rest of the book, so I'll forgive him for that."
5,A Neo-Borgsian Riff Collage,"I love this book. It blends the idea of novels, articles, films, television and the internet. It's a horror novels that exploded into something better and more exciting. It's like Jorge Luis Borges went drinking with Stephen King, and was joined by David Foster Wallce (on a journalism kick); then the whole thing was blended up by Jeff Noon and put back together by a stoned Stephen Hawking and read to you by John Malkovich after a three-day bender. But better.Read it or despair."
5,Great Purchase!!,"I bought this book for a gift and had a limited amount of time to get it. But with the quick shipping everything turned out great! The book came in perfect condition, I have no complaints! It was well worth the price."
1,just leaves,A huge waste of paper. Could have been done one tenth of space. Pages and pages of garbage so irrelevent it really angered me when I realized I had been reading what felt like a phone book or dictionary.There actually was a cool story inside but it got totaly stretched out to thin to care how it went. Waywaywayway over-rated. Rod Serling would cringe.
4,Book Co-Exists With Album of Author's Sister,"An interesting note on this novel: the book was co-released with the album ""Haunted"" by singer-songwriter Poe (best known for her 1995 hit ""Angry Johnny,"" and who is, in actuality, Annie Danielewski, sister of Mark.) ""Haunted"" has songs that correspond with various themes and concepts in the book ""House of Leaves."" It's advisable that someone who reads this book also listen to the album before, after, or better yet, during.The two rely so heavily on each other for total comprehension that Mark and Annie toured the nation together at the time of their releases, alternating between song performances and narrating chapters of the book."
2,Dense and....interesting,"Like others, I had heard House of Leaves was supposed to be this fabulously scary book. Unfortunately, I spent so much time turning the book around, reading backwards, flipping pages, and getting lost in the footnotes, that I was constantly pulled out of the horror. Which seems a shame, because I think the underlying horror story could be scary. It's an interesting attempt at interactive reading, an idea which I like, but it didn't quite work for me. I know I gave it 2 stars, rather than 3, and that's because I just couldn't get into the story. Like the others reviewers, if you're looking for something unusual and interactive with your books, this may well be it."
4,Tough sledding but worth it,"Although this is not a conventional horror story by any means it did give me the willies in several places. I found it tough sledding at first but then gradually the thing started taking me over and the characters assumed palpability in my mind. Almost the best thing (and certainly the scariest) in the book is the very end (spoiler). House of Leaves is also quite good on the way photographers think.Among the more noteworthy features of this book is its bizarre, inventive typography. As the characters get lost in geometry, the reader is forced to turn the book upside down and sideways and flip backwards and forwards and a host of other things beside. It's almost stupidly literal, but the odd thing is that it works, or at least it did for me. I finished the book with the sense of waking up from a dream -- a pleasurably creepy one."
1,But not for me,"Bought this after a friend on Facebook commented that this was one of the scariest books ever. This was a really intelligent friend, so I took his word for it. I was optimistic at the beginning, but the further I read, the more boring it got. Passed it on to my adult daughter who tried and failed to get interested. I guess I (and she) are readers to need a ""hook"" to get into a book. (I was however, able to struggle through the first 300 pages of ""The Name of the Rose"" until I was ""hooked"") This paperbook version had gorgeous colored graphics inside.....unusual and stunning for a paperback, but did not make up for the style of writing. I really wanted to love this book. Didn't happen."
3,"It was good, but not as epic as I'd heard.","It was definitely worth a read and I am glad that I read it, but after hearing it hyped up time after time I found the actual book to be less than epic. Too much of the book was worthless filler and/or nonsense, like a box spanning multiple partial pages that contains nothing but a list of examples of architecture, or a page long list of fictional names."
4,Great Read,"I found this book bother over- and underrated. I liked it an awful lot--it offered some genuine chills, and the academic approach to the main story was both refreshing and rewarding. On the other hand, there were times when I found myself wondering why I couldn't just read the story myself or watch the movie. Still, I think this approach worked very well, and all the extras gave me quite a bit of bang for my buck. I'm not one to go through a book breaking codes or spend hours on end discussing it on the internet, but I had a lot of fun reading House of Leaves."
5,Awesome Book,"I purchased and read this book when it first came out and loved it. Not only does it bring about different ideas, it is well written and put together in an art-like way. When my copy was stolen I decided to buy another one, which was rather modestly priced, from amazon.com"
1,Horror Section?,"This is absolutly the worst ""book"" I have ever read! ""A great novel"", ""Sublimely creepy"", ""House of Leaves actually gave me nightmares"". These are some of the comments on the back cover that caught my attention. This ""book"" is full of appendixes, footnotes, and ""anyalitical critiques"" from ""outside experts"" commenting on what is suposed to be the main story. If there was a main story here, it went way passed me. I purchased this book for a new experience in horror fiction. The only thing horrific about it was the $20.00 I wasted on buying it. If you feel you need to read this book because of how interesting the reviewers make it sound, take my advise, check it out from your local library. Makes for an easy return."
2,I Don't Want to Jump on the Bandwagon...,"...but I really wanted to like this book. For the first hundred pages, the story was truly frightening and interesting, but the shifts between Zampano's and Truant's accounts, and the endless footnotes, were way too much for me. The story of the house probably would have been much better if written in a more traditional manner, as would the story of both Truant and Zampano if written on their own.I think this book is a good case of an author trying too hard, and would like to see the author try again. Next time the attempt should be a little less ""trendy"" and should just try to relate a strong, interesting story."
3,It scared me!,"Wow! I read this book in one long session, and believe me, about 3/4 of the way through, you just don't know which way to turn the page to go forward! It is like reading an Escher painting. Stories within stories. . . symbols that turn out to be reality and reality that turns out to be symbols -- yikes! Don't read this unless you can handle a trip at least 5 and 1/2 minutes into your own psyche. Madness abounds. This is a haunted house story like none other (though the aftertaste is rather like ""House on the Borderland""). And I thought my heart would break for Johnny Truant. I will not give any of the story away (you have to read it yourself! No helpful hints!). But this is definitely worth the trouble the book initially presents."
4,An enjoyable read by a daring newcomer,"This book is really a lot of fun, but it is certainly not for someone who expects something like Stephen King. I bought this book and started reading it before I heard all of the ""hype"". It took me about three pages and all I could think of was Infinite Jest (and not Stephen King). The book pokes fun at academia and its tendency to overanalyze ad nauseum. He's got two interesting stories intertwined, but frankly it took me a while to get into the story of the house, while Johnny Truant's story I found interesting from the get go. I would recommend this book to someone who enjoys David Foster Wallace and who is not afraid to read footnotes. I completely disagree with some of the reviewers here who recommend skipping the footnotes. Frankly, they don't get it, and you won't either if you skip them. If you like Stephen King and want a scary novel, wait for his next book."
5,House of Leaves,"This is the greatest book I have ever read. Unfortunately it is so good, that nothing I have read since seems worth finishing.If you attempt to read this book, I recommend that you put aside two weeks, in which you have no responisibilites. Find a safe room, disconnect the phone, lock yourself in, Prepare food, that you don't have to cook.Get yourself a mirror, a morse code key, pencil and paper.Don't read this book if you are agoraphobic, afraid of the dark, or have nightmares about looming staircases.Don't be alarmed if you lose track of days, forget to eat, go to the bathroom,forget who you are, or have nightmares in which you awake to find yourself still in a nightmare about a dark enormous looming staircase with no way out.Make sure that you have a friend to help you nearby, if it all goes wrong.If I ever meet Mark Z. Danielewsky, I will tell him he is a genius an then run away from him very very fast,"
1,Get this man an editor.,"When I took creative writing in the 8th grade, my teacher passed out a study on writers who used Macintoshes vs. writers who used PCs. The verdict: writers who used Macs spent too much time on formatting the appearance in a creative way and less upon the writing itself. This directly applies to the fifty pages of spiraling text. If you put the text in a single paragraph... is it really that interesting? If Danielewski had skipped the hundred pages of footnotes that are useless (why read fictional footnotes? 3 pages of fictional names?) and cut Johnny Truant (can anyone argue that this character is believable? he was not charming enough to follow through with his sexual escapades, even his name is ridiculous); the story is readable. Worthwhile though? There are 15 haunted house stories that surpass this."
1,I Want My Time & Money Back!,"Unwisely drawn to architectonic balderdash (the weirder the better), I wanted very much to like this book. Try as I might, I couldn't. Did you ever think you might achieve something truly noteworthy by imitating what others have done with great success, bit by bit assembling your scattered imitations, hoping the end result would justify your borrowed means? Authors do, and I suspect this is what Mark Danielewski has tried to do with House of Leaves. Despite occasional flashes of better than decent writing, it just doesn't work for him. Why? There's no heart here; no vivifying center. The result is a poorly contrived, highly pretentious mess. Don't waste your money and time. Alas, I did."
1,actually 1/2 star,Don't waste your time trying to decipher this supposed novel. Will make a good paper weight. Fortunately I got a copy from the library and didn't waste my money. Don't let the good reviews fool you. Check it out at the library first....
3,can any one tell me whether ur book have the same content?,"since i can't post image in this review,i post the link below from other site and it's 100% secure no virus. [...]"
5,Fantastic,"Mesmerizing book. The style, the format, the writing, the dialogue on all levels keeps you glued to the pages. To coin a common phrase, ""I couldn't put it down"". Highly recommend."
1,"Boring, boring, boring","Don't let anyone fool you into thinking that this is a piece of entertaining literature. It was tedious reading, and after finishing it I realized to my dismay that I had wasted hours of my life which I will never be able to regain. Read it and weep, or pass on this book and spend your time on novels which are actually enjoyable."
3,Too much,"This is a good book, but I got bogged down. I enjoyed all the stories within the story, especially the letters by the narrator's mother. I just needed to take a break from it once in awhile, to come back to it after reading some other things."
1,I don't get it.,"It wasn't scary. It wasn't interesting. It wasn't particularly well-written. It was difficult to read. In short, WTF?"
3,"one step below literature one step above ""formula book""","His book is certainly a novel idea: tell two or three stories in one book. Johnny Truant, Zampano, Navidson and his family, Johnny's Mom, etc.. Its a terrific idea but the writing falls short. Read this book if you are into the horror genre and want something different."
2,"Dude, what the F?","How many people out there can get into this book? 3. The best marketers in the world all got together and sold a million copies of this pile of [...] and made an 'author' out of a guy that can't tell a story to save his life. I talked to someone about it once, he said that you just don't have to like it for the first half and then it gets good. that is what i look for in a book 40k words that I hate before it gets almost okay.Know anyone else like this?I'm looking at you David Foster Wallace."
2,Self indulgent,"Self-indulgent post-modern hall of mirrors. If you want that, I recommend INFINITE JEST instead. Sections of inspired prose, but too much pastiche of academic media studies. Deliberately hard to puzzle out: There is some erudition, but more often the difficulty is simply the layout (mirror writing, e.g.). Frequently more attention is paid to the layout than the prose. I read SF/F/H. Stripped of the gimmickry nothing is new. Hodgson's HOUSE ON THE BORDERLAND and Lovecraft. BLAIR WITCH, POLTERGEIST, and HELLRAISER. I read the whole thing to find what happens, but found it not worth the effort. Ending is anticlimactic."
5,this is not a book,"I picked this book up one afternoon at Rizzoli in the WFC, and felt cheated. This was not the book I was looking for. This was something else - not a book, more like a journey, with a cacaphony of voices bleating off the pages. I didn't know about the reviews, the prizes, the nominations. All I knew was I needed something to do while waiting for a friend to finish her damn meeting and come down for lunch, and figured burning some time in a bookstore would be a good thing, since I had a 2 hour flight to JAX in 4 hours. I knew something was wrong after the first 3 chapters, after I got up from my aisle seat and got lost in the plane's restroom."
5,"Unusual, Creative, and absolutely thrilling!!","If you're looking for something different, exceptional, and constantly intriguing, then pick this book asap. it's an incredible ride - almost too intricate to describe but DEFINITELY worth a read!!!"
4,"brilliant, unique novel","this book is an instant page turner. after the first 50 or so pages, I became hooked and pulled by the book's stong gravitational pull. This novel will keep you reading with its bizzare plot and figurative language.the set up of this book is very unique also. it constantly flashes back between two views. The life of johnny truant, and a novel Inside this novel. great book for people who read David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest. Highly Recommended>"
4,House of Leaves,Very interesting book- have to keep track of which character is telling the story- I can only read a few chapters at a time. Not the usual book- only for the inquiring mind.
1,Won't start after on 15 short uses,"I thought it was a decent trimmer until I went to start it up the other day. It has completely stopped working after only a handful of uses. I feel conned. I can't believe that it didn't even last one year. I would NEVER recommend this product. It's a cheap piece of garbage. My dad bought one last year, and his is doing the same thing. Troy Bilt should be ashamed!"
2,angie v.,"This is a nice looking hoop. Appears sturdy. However, everytimeit is hit with the small basketball that it came with, the basketcollapses. It goes down into a fold position. My son is very frustated with it. At this point I think I have to hot glue it to get it tostay in place."
5,More fantastic reading,"If you haven't read the previous novel, then I don't suggest reading this one yet. Get the first one, Gracelin O'Malley, and be prepared for a weekend of serious reading. If you haven't read the first, you won't be lost, as much is explained, but the first in the triology gives a lot of background detail, which is left out.I loved this book as much as the first, and was really disappointed when it ended. Gracelin moves to America and starts finding her way amongst a large and repressed Irish population. More trials await her in America, but she manages to overcome and hangs onto the hope she brought with her.I eagerly await the last book, which is in the mail as I type!"
4,Beautifully written and instructive as well.,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. Dowling manages to combine sometimes lyrical prose with factual information about Islam. Then these are both set within a journey made by himself and his girl friend. I learnt a lot about the Muslim religion incidentally, the best way for me to learn, I think. I enjoyed very much the adventures en route and the beauty of places I will probably never visit. On humid English August afternoons, I was transported to another world. Please write some more Mr Dowling."
3,Decent system,"I purchased 3 of these for use in my church. I should have read the description a little closer, didn't realize this particular item doesn't include a mic, so we had to get the mics from a local dealer. It's a pretty decent wireless system, we've had a few issues with interference and pops, but not a bad deal for the price."
1,doesn't work,"The trimmer didn't run properly out of the box the first time I used it. The second time I tried using it it wouldn't even start. Now I am stuck going through the manufacturer since Amazon says it won't take it back.Thanks for nothing. If you want a trimmer, buy it local so you can return it if it is broken."
4,a new diabetic must-have,"Lots of good, practical, everyday information here for the new diabetic or for any type 2 diabetic who has never been taught anything and wants to learn more. This one is a must-read."
3,Not worth the money,"If you really want to learn about diabetes, to on line. There are thousands of recipes and so much information available that this book is truly not necessary. I don't even know where mine is. :("
5,Get this book for any newly diagnosed person!,"Luckily my husband ordered this book for me just after I was diagnosed in December. Using the information in this book, I decided to ignore my GP's wait and see attitude, do frequent testing, and demanded anti-GAD testing when my BG initially went down, then began to climb after 3 months of an extremely strict diet (I'm thin to start with). Based on this test my diagnosis has been switched to LADA - something that might not have happened until my BG went thru the roof if I hadn't read this book. (I'd give it 20 stars if that were possible)"
5,Not my fault,I just started to read this book. It is hard to put down.It starts off with -- it is not your fault. Then explains why. I felt like a boulder was lifted off my chest.It also talks about should you or should you not tell people about your diabetes.I read these chapters - and it was just what I was thinking and feeling.My best friend - who made me feel like crap for getting diabetes - told me it was all my fault. And that only fat/overweight people get it. That I caused this problem. I plan on making her read the chapter on NOT my fault.Reading the first couple of chapters made me feel better. I can't wait to read the rest of this book.
5,A good book for a new diabetic,"I bought this book the day I was diagnosed as a Type 2 diabetic, along with two other texts. This one was far more comprehensive and better indexed. Even now that my diagnosis has changed to Type 1 (LADA), I still turn to it daily as a reference. It has detailed information about the various tests that are being done in the early stages that was invaluable to me when my pcp said I was too old to be type 1, but I didn't have any of the known risk factors for type 2.I'd strongly recommend this book for any adult newly diagnosed with diabetes. I haven't found anything comprable for Type 1, as yet."
4,A Must Have Book,"This is a great book!!! I have read it twice cover to cover and refer to it every few days. Packed with valuable easy to understand information and encouragement. This a must have book for anyone who has been diagnoised with TYPE 2 Diabetes, Have your loved read it too."
4,Explains things well,"I bought this for my dad for Christmas. He just turned 70 & was diagnosed in July so it's been an adjustment. On the recommendation of my husband who sells insulin and now knows a lot about diabetes, we bought this and my dad says he really likes it. He said its not filled with a lot of the medical talk, making it easier to grasp for the non-medical person."
2,They work in my Hitachi brad nailer,"Go to your local big box store and buy these brads (a lot) cheaper, plus have a better choice of the lengths needed"
5,Great tool.,"Performed better than expected. I used it to put trim up in my finished basement and it really made the job easier. The holes it left were so small, they are almost unnoticable. Glad I bought it. WIFE HAPPY."
1,The meaning of Passover,"is about the Jews' emergence from slavery to Mt. Sinai withG-d's help, where they received the law. Anything else can't be called a ""Haggadah""."
1,messianic is not jewish,"please be aware that the one thing jews across the entire spectrum from orthodox to reform agree upon is that it is not possible to be jewish and believe in jesus at the same time. while a person who believes in jesus and lives according to jewish teachings may well be utterly good and decent, s/he is following a tradition that is not accepted within the faith tradition known as judaism. furthermore, many messianics in my experience conceal this piece of information. i thus wish to note: caveat emptor!"
4,Loved the book and the movie,"This is a fun book for children. It went over the top of many of first grader's heads, but when I showed them the movie, they were able to make the connections to the book."
1,Misleading Description,The description stated Prancer cassette with book. I purchased this particular one because I needed the book on tape to use in my classroom. It is only the book and does not contain the book on tape also. If I would have known that I would have purchased it for less money from another seller. The book was in good condition but I gave it a low rating so that hopefully they'll change the description.
1,No Windows 7 support,This product has no Windows 7 support and there are no publicized plans for releasing Win 7 drivers.
2,Not my thing.,Not my thing simple as that. Sorry but no. Save your money if you want something like gundam wing. :(
4,Awesome Continuation of the Series,"When Serenity got pulled after just one short, but wonderful season, I mourned its loss. The characters were well developed and fresh. It was one of the best sci-fi television ventures ever. When I heard they were making a movie, I was glad, but afraid they would lose the essence of the series. The movie exceeded my expectations, but some of the human casualties were devastating. There were some plot discontinuities, but I'll forgive those as being necessary to make a mass market movie for those who hadn't seen the series. I hope this will not be the end."
4,Serenity (2005),"This exemplary continuation of the Fox television series Firefly proves that a TV-to-big screen transition is not always rough. Directed by Joss Whedon (who also directed the short-lived series), Serenity (which shares its name with the program's beloved ship) is a science-fiction action-comedy with a classic Western feel that delivers in each of its numerous genre categories, while simultaneously refreshing viewers with relatable characters and a convincing script. As was the case on the show, Nathan Fillion steals the spotlight as the goofy, yet legendary captain, Malcolm Reynolds. Malcolm and his crew venture through space, on the run from the governing Alliance, which seeks two of Reynolds' new passengers: Simon; and, more importantly, his sister, River, whose telepathy and mental and physical capacities pose as a threat against its reign."
5,Watch the TV series first,"I'm not sure if I would have been AS in love with this film if I had not watched the entire TV series. In Firefly (13 episodes then cancelled), the character development is almost complete by the end of the pilot episode. River's personality takes a while to develop, and Jayne evolves as well during the 13 weeks, but mostly, you are in love with each unique character right away. I've never seen it done better.The story lines are nice, too, but I almost think that is not the point. At the end of the movie, I leave not saying ""I want more adventure"", but ""I want to see more of Zoe and Mal and Inara, and especially the delightful Kaylee""."
5,This movie is the best scifi film since the original Star Wars,"Since 1977, there has not been a sci-fi film that captured the magic, romance, humor, and adventure as well as Star Wars. Serenity has turned that all around.Joss Whedon is a genius. He ""gets"" life, and he ""gets"" the pathos required to make a character truly lovable. This is a movie for intelligent, mature, movie lovers. If you are one of those people who think XXX is a good flick, or think that Fight Club was really about fighting, OR, if you're someone who only watches those ""slice of life"" films (which are good in their own right), you won't understand this film and shouldn't bother. But otherwise, go for it and buy several copies. Support this type of creative and artistic direction."
5,Serenity now!,"Great movie, great characters, it's a mystery to me why the series and movie didn't do better. So many people I know haven't even heard of it. That says something for the marketing, I think.One of the best movies of the year, without a doubt."
5,got the film and the series,"I am so guttered that the series has ended and the film just put it all together. If anyone wants to watch a wonderful film with sci-fi, comedy, and suspense then this film is worth it. Watched loads of Sci-fi and just wished this wasn't the end for now but heh life goes on. A must for the shelf..."
1,The trailer was better than enduring the movie,"I was led to think that in this movie, a great deal of myth and magic met science fiction. I was obviously wrong in the endeavor and realized that it was a bunch of throw-away danger and one oddball psychic girl that trances out and becomes a killing machine. The dialogue sounded rather rehearsed and uninspired. The really great action happened far too late and disappointingly too little. As for sci-fi pictures involving a governmental coverup, the climactic reveal in this movie came as a melodramatic revelation. I certainly hope that the show this film was based off had a better fanbase, because I thought the movie was a lackluster stinkbomb."
1,Rent it!,Don't buy this should-have-stuck-to-the-small-screen movie. There are reasons for movie rentals. This is one. FX's are great. Script is so tedious and goes nowhere during the first hour. First five minutes are among the best. Try Cowboy Bee bop for the real thing.
5,Greatest movie of 2005,"I saw this movie, and fell in love with it. This is by far the greatest movie of 2005, much much better than Star Wars episode 3, I'm a fan of Star Wars, but that movie blew, it had great acting, great music, and amazing effects. Joss Whedon can truly be happy about this movie. The movie had me laughing one minute, tense with anticipation the next, and then crying. Even through my tears this movie made me laugh constantly, Joss is a comic genius. He managed to get the feel of the show, put a darker twist on it, and then give it back to us for Christmas. I give this the hightest recomendation, if you don't see it you are missing out on one of the greatest movies of all time."
3,need more firefly,"Movie is very good. wish they would make alot more! Goof film, good acting, good directing! everything you want in a SI Fi"
2,lost the charm,"i cannot say how disappointing this movie was, after loving the TV series so much. the movie lost everything that was good about the series: relationships, values, wit, and quirkiness that comes along with people just trying to make it the best way they can. serenity pandered to 10 year old boys who want kick boxing and space ships shooting at each other. i was bored out of my mind. now, don't get me wrong: i love a good fight in any format, when there is some motivation behind it that is worthwhile. i wanted so much to love this and cannot express fully my disappointment... sorry, joss, but this, in my opinion, is the stake in the heart of one of my favorite scifi TV series ever."
1,WOW! That was NOT a 4.6 star movie.,"This movie is nowhere near its 4.6 rating. Acting and dialog were mediocre, character development was lacking. If you compare it to movies like Mad Max then maybe 3 stars, otherwise if you are not a fan or this series, don't waste your time. It was very disappointing."
1,A cult film?,"I am a fan of science fiction, but I can't see what this film has that generates such high ratings."
1,"Overhyped, unoriginal, corny and cheesy","Serenity is a movie that apeals to the geekiest of geeks. The dialogue is lame and the storyline whilst having potential is ruined by corny and cheesy attempts at comedy, not to mention the substandard acting.Considering the fact that the firefly series was a failure on Fox, it is no suprise at all that Serenity was also a failure at the box office. The only suprise is how bad Serenity actually was even compared to the failed firefly series."
3,Very good.,I really liked the series (Firefly). Why Joss whedon decided to kill off some characters in the movie is beyond me. I think that when you have an ensemble cast that you put the writing effort in to make them click as a team you should keep them. It probably shows the writers ran out of ideas.
5,A Unique Film,"Anyone else notice how a lot of the negative reviews here fail to explain just why they didn't enjoy the film? There's a reason for that; because it's an excellent film that pleases both fans and nonfans alike.Following on from the television series, ""Firefly"", ""Serenity"" is set 500 years in the future where a crew of people aboard the serenity ship try to make a living while avoiding the clutches of the totalitarian government alliance.Things are complicated when a girl with psychic ability boards the ship; who is valuable to the aliance.This film is particularly well written, manages an ensemble cast well with witty one-liner dialogue and tells a unique storyline with a space-western feel to it, whilst enabling itself to explore political and powerful concerns important in today's society.This is one of the rare good films to have been released this year and certainly worth keeping on your shelf at home next to the original star wars collection."
4,A DEFINITE 5 FOR THE MOVIE--BUT LAME SPECIAL FEATURES!,"I bought the original Serenity, and it became my favorite movie of all time, spawned by the great series Firefly. So, the movie rocks. But I pre-ordered this edition and looked forward to it eagerly, but the special features are actually really lame. Plus, the DVD menu sucks, the first one was better.But who cares! Buy this and see it!"
5,Great ending to a TV series that was cut short.,"I had seen this movie at the theater without watching the TC series. Now that I have finally watched the TC series and gone back to watch the movie I am very impressed with the movie.The movie stays true to the series and neatly wraps up the numerous loose ends the series had. It still feels like some of the plot elements were wrapped up in a hurry, and I am sure they were.Still this was a very satisfying end, to an otherwise open-ended series. I especially like watching the Outtakes."
5,THE NEXT STAR WARS & TREK,"STAR TREK AND FIREFLY WHERE BOTH CANCELED TV SHOWS ... BUT FIREFLY DIDN'T LAST ONE SEASON , SO HOW COULD IT COME BACK FROM THE DEAD ? ... IT HAS THE MAGIC OF SOMETHING GREATER THAN TREK ... WARS!!! FORGET THE JEDI FOR THE MOMENT AND THINK "" WHAT IF HAN SOLO WAS THE MAIN GUY IN STAR WARS AND LUKE WAS JUST ALONG FOR THE RIDE ? "" YOU HAVE A MOVIE BETTER THAN ""THE PHANTOM MENACE "" AND BETTER THAN ANY "" NEXT GENERATION SHOW "" !THE FILM JUST HAS A CHARM TO IT THAT DRAWS YOU IN AND THATS HOW THE SHOW WAS ... ALL CHARM !!!"
1,Extremely disappointed,"Given the large budget and resources available for Serenity, I expected it to be a genuinely good movie and a fitting conclusion to the fantastic firefly series. Sadly I was mistaken.The simple fact is Joss Whedon sold out for money, just like so many do these days. He ruined everything that was good about the firefly series. Shame on you Joss..."
1,Makes Ed Wood look good,"Silly and trite storyline. The dialogue is silly, cliche, andchildish. This is like a bad-sci-fi channel original picture."
4,Space western,"I very much enjoyed the TV series from which this film evolvedand I enjoyed this film. The acting was good and the story was also. Unfortunately, killing off some of the characters makes a sequal difficult."
1,Movie 4 stars - this version is a ripoff,"First, let me say that I love Serenity. What I don't like is how they recycled the original DVD and added so-called ""extras"" in this version and are charging full-price for it. The ""extras"" are not worth it - as you watch them, you'll notice they use the same footage over and over again. The case is nice, but they really want to suck your wallet empty by inserting a sales flier listing ""official Serenity"" merchandise you can order - that's all this version is about - bleeding you dry. I was very disappointed in that I was expecting to see alot of unreleased/raw footage and this was not the case. What a shame - a blown opportunity to provide fans with a truly memorable collection - the only memorable thing about this version is the lack of material and the full price."
1,Nothing really new in this edition,"I eagerly awaiting receiving this DVD and then was completely disappointed. I don't know why they needed a second DVD -- they could have fit it all on one. There's really nothing new here except the same content re-edited over and over into 3-4 minute segments, a 21 minute segment that aired on SciFi, and River Tamm stuff that was already online. The movie itself is exactly the same (with the addition of DTS). Uh...I love this movie, but I didn't need a second copy with regurgitated crap on it."
4,Released at the right time!,"I guess I'll start with saying I have never seen Firefly so I had no expectations.Simon (Sean Maher) rescues his little telepathic sister River (Summer Glau) from the Alliance, but something makes her turn against the crew on Serenity and Sean decides it's best for them to leave. After watching the tapes from where she attacks the crew find out she's saying ""Miranda"" before she goes maniac. The captain takes them back on and is determined to find out who/what Miranda is and why the Alliance is after River.This is a great sci-fi movie and came out at the right time. The movie is whole and no scenes are wasted. There are witty lines all through the movie and you do not wait for it to end. I am already hoping for a sequel."
4,Bittersweet *semi-spoilers*,"It was good. A nice tribute to the show. Can't bear to give it less than 4 stars, even though there were a few things that I didn't like - like the deaths of certain people, one especially . . . . it just wasn't right. But then, Joss Whedon has a dirty habit of killing off beloved people in the last ""episodes"" of his serieses. And the contention at the beginning between Mal and Simon. I mean, it was just like, boom, all of the sudden River saving the ship and expressing how she feels about the crew in the last Firefly episode is all but forgotten. Alas. But it worked. Mal finding the thing that could help bring down the Alliance for good was a nice touch - though it would have worked better in a season two ;). Anyhow, any Firefly fan MUST see Serenity, and any Buffy/Angel fan must see Firefly and then Serenity (Otherwise it makes less sense)!"
3,Decent movie but not for new followers of Firefly.,You'll surely like this movie if you've followed the original Firefly series. This movie is just a continuation of the story that takes the series to some kind of conclusion using the movie. Special effects are quite decent and the production is of a high quality. But the story line is a bit weak - I mean it could have been written better. Overall the movie is quite watchable and entertaining but definitely not mind blowing. You'll get the answer to why Reavers are who they are with this movie.
2,Serenity / Firefly,I got this movie and the Firefly series since the review were soooo good. My husband is a huge Si-Fi fan and so I thought since I am a Castle (Nathan Fillion) fan I'd get this for some together time on the couch. We watched the first episode of Firefly and weren't impressed in all. That's why I have not watched Serenity yet. I will try to get into it when I have more time. But right now I rather watch Castle when I have a moment to watch TV than this.
5,Fantastic Movie,We enjoyed this in the theatre and now at home. The outtakes are hilarious. We hope to see a second movie! This movie beats Star Wars by light years.
5,awesome conclusion to the series,"awesome conclusion to the series but so so sad... have your tissues (or sleeve) ready... oh, and nail biting is a problem with this one too"
5,The kind of movie you always need,"Enough people have talked about the history behind the movie and debated its genre that I'll be very brief: this is the best adventure film since Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Wonderfully smart (and witty!) archetypal characters, a simple us-against-them story that evolves into something much larger, and expertly-scripted, unbearably tense action sequences smattered throughout. Serenity is going to become one of those perfect lazy-Saturday toss-it-in-the-DVD-player and just relax kind of movies, perfect on the shelf alongside Raiders or Butch and Sundance. A great, incredibly accessible entertainment."
5,Serenity,"What can I say? This movie is the final installment of the captivating series Firefly by Joss Whedon. If you know the series, then you're going to buy this movie. If not, then welcome to the end of a great story. The movie picks up at the end of the Firefly series. I strongly recommend that you pick up the Firefly season along with this DVD. The show and the movie have characters that are easy to love and hate. My favorite part about both the movie and the series is how the characters all make fun of and mess with each other. I could see my friends in the characters of the show and that always makes for more entertainment."
4,Just okay.,A little dark for my taste but after watching the series it is interesting to know where Reavers come from. Rivers' fight scenes are pretty awesome. Did not enjoy the movie as much as I did the series; not enough of the light humor presented in the series.
5,Review of Serenity,This is a good follow up to the Firefly tv show. The characters are well thought out and played very well by each actor.
5,Firefly how can you go wrong?,"The movie was great, and based on how it feels compared to the Firefly series it is great!! I had at first had hard feelings about watching a movie about a series that died after one season. But after watching this movie I found myself wanting to watch the series, and I got to say that if they turned the theme into a video game or made or extended the story of the show in some way it would be one of the greatest things I could think of and I would greatly enjoy any of it as long as it's executed well. Like many people I prefer wide screen formats, because all thou it makes the top of the screen smaller and the bottom it tends to give you more content on the left and right sides of the video feed.ROCK ON FIREFLY!!!!"
4,Great Movie but lacks the fun of the series.,"Movie is worth watching. However, the show far, far outshines this flick.If you need a little ""Firefly"" fix, then this is for you. I sure do miss that show."
5,Col,"Not as great as the series, but hey they did what they could in the two hours or so they had. Wraps up the series nicely."
4,Great science fiction,To a degree in that the director did obey the fact that in space. There's no Sound! good job. there's even a planet where liberals would love to control over and tree huggers can live in joyful abandon!!!To all tree huggers and libatards; come to the home that misses you!!! Just ignore all those pesky cannibals roaming about here and there...
5,"Fantastic movie, return the series to TV","The movie was exciting and fascinating so I had to buy the DVD. I don't consider myself a SciFi fanatic but this show is great. The series should be on Tv again; it's more intelligent, witty, and exciting than almost any show on Tv now."
1,Alone in the Verse,"I hated this movie. What had been a show about Mal and his crew became a movie, River the Reaver Slayer. At the big fight scene, I wish everyone had died and just ended the stupid movie since to me Firefly was dead. Yes there were a few good moments and some great lines but that was at the beginning of the movie. Jayne (Adam Baldwin) was terrific as usual. I saw the movie at an advanced screening and refused to see it when it hit theaters and would never ever waste my money on it like I wasted my time seeing it."
1,B Grade Sci-Fi,"I really can't understand all these rave reviews giving 5 stars and saying that Serenity is the best movie ever. It is the sort of movie that you would expect on something like the Sci-Fi channel, certainly not something that I would expect to see at the cinemas and it is clear from the box office results that most people agreed with my view.I was actually a fan of the firefly series, but Serenity was a huge disappointment and it felt like something that Joss Whedon had done in desperation, as firefly was not at all the sort of series that was made to be a theatrical release.In reality I would probably give Serenity 2-3 stars but I thought I would give it 1 to counter all the ridiculous 5 star reviews.Also be careful when looking at the dvd cover, as it doesn't at all represent what happens in the actual movie."
1,A ripoff; look elsewhere...,"This is a cut-down version of the excellent Timeless collection of California Ramblers sides recorded for Columbia. That collection, with an additional ten tracks, is in print and available on Amazon, so buy it already - support Timeless and ignore these bootleggers!"
3,A great multi-part magazine article; not a 300-pg plus book,"Largely anecdotal ramblings spinkled with occasional laser-like insights. Annoyingly, Ross took what could have been a good multi-part article and bloated it with meandering errata.Still, a message was clearly conveyed.If you have the patience to wade through the verbage, you'll learn that Celebration is a place of Disneyesque dreams and high expectations, few of which have been delivered despite the ""E-Ticket"" price of admission."
3,Intersting,I had the chance to visit Celebration this spring on a trip to WDW. I found the book interesting and inciteful in learning more about this community. I believe readers will get a very well written account of life in this community at its inception as well as Ross's take on this community. A good read.
1,What a nightmare!,"A windy montage of extemporaneous rambling. This book is neither concise nor interesting. Dr. Ross must have one of the largest vocabularies ever known to mankind, or else he has somehow programmed his word processor's thesaurus to replace every adjective with the counterpart containing the largest number of syllables. The definitive history of Celebration remains to be written. I will use this book as an example of what occurs when book lacks judicious editing. Recommended only for those who understand the concept of theoretical bricolage."
3,Want to learn about Celebration?,"Andrew Ross didn't want to like Celebration. His urban friends laughed at him when he moved there to do research for this book. In the end, he liked some of the ideas behind the town, but hated the fact that it took Disney to think them up. His blind hatred for the corporate world shows up in every page of this book, so if you want to read anti-corporation diatribes, this is a dream read. But if you actually want to find out about Celebration, you'll find the book's subject curiously neglected. This is an odd beast, a book about Celebration that hardly seems to be about the town at all. For an excellent view of the town, read the other book written at about the same time by a couple who became Celebration homeowners. They have a much less knee-jerk perspective."
2,This book left loose ends,"I have bought and shared all of Constance's books and I believe in metaphysical theories, but this book was wierd. I liked the addition of parallel worlds, but it was done in a way that didn't make any sense and at the end of the book there were loose ends that never got answered. I kept wishing I could re-write the plot. Needless to say, I won't be passing this book on to anybody."
1,"""A TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT""","I WAS EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS BOOK. I LOVE TIME TRAVEL ROMANCES AND WAS REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO READING THIS BOOK. I KEPT READING PAGE AFTER PAGE HOPING THAT I WOULD BE ABLE TO GET PAST THE BORING REPEATITIVE LOVE SOLILIQUY BUT ALAS ""TWAS NOT TO BE"". IT WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO FINISH THIS BOOK. IF YOU WANT TO SPEND A COLD WINTER EVENING ENGROSSED IN A TIME TRAVEL NOVEL....LEAVE THIS ONE AND RE-READ ANY BOOK IN DIANE GABALDON'S OUTLANDER SERIES!"
2,Not at her best..........,What a disappointment from this author. Not one of her best. I so much look forward to this authors work and was very disappointed. There was no knight in shining armor as some readers stated. The ending was so bad and did not explain anything from the novel. What happened to the great time travel stories we expect from Ms. Flannery?
1,"Could have been worse, but he would have to have tried","Ok, so you think you've read to worst tech thriller? Not until you've tried Fortunes of War.Complex plot, believable characters, a realistic scenario...these are all dicarded in favour of some chest pounding and flag waving for the good ole US.Mr Coonts gives the Japanese a super plane to make the kids from the US underdogs but to allow them to win makes the Japanese so stupid as to be comical.I knew I was losing interest when I started skimming chapters to try and get to the end.A 14 year old could have done a better job.Quite simply: the worst book I've read this year."
2,"OK Techno-Thriller, Terrible story line","Now I like Coonts and I have his other books with Jake Grafton- But, this books seemed to be written with 21st century technology but 1950's tactics. This book would have us believe that modern jet planes only occasionally use missles to shoot down jet planes- according to Coonts they really shoot down other planes with machine guns! It also leads us to believe that a diesel submarine is more dangerous than a nuclear sub! I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because the plot was pretty good and believable, the writing was horrid though. I wish I could send it back"
3,A lost gem for Hitchcock's fans.,"The quality of this cd-r is all right, and I am happy that it can be played on my dvd player. Though Hitchcock's participation in this film was minimum, as a fan of this great director, I still want to own everything that he made. I think most of Hitchcock's fans would agree with me."
2,Terrible printing,"The product was delivered in a timely manner and was in new condition. However the printing quality of the text was terrible. It is not textbook quality. If the publisher was going for a mass produced Holy Bible feel, then they nailed it. I am not sure how they can charge $200 for this book. It is almost like a newspaper. The publisher of the text is CBLS (Ceramic Book & Literature Service) New Delhi, India. The distributor ACAMEDIA was very sympathetic, kind and understanding. I would purchase from ACAMEDIA again but not from this CBLS."
1,Hype or Tripe,"Believe none of what you hear and only half of what you see was something I learned a long time ago. I would certainly apply the adage to this book.In all of his ""biographies, according to David Bret, every (deceased) person in the movie industry; male and female, from the lighting technicians to the highest paid stars and the movie moguls themselves; the single and the married as well, were all either, bi-sexual, lesbian, homosexual... or wish they were. Mr. Bret offers no proof except what apparently exists in the fantasy dream world of others or his own imagination... and perhaps wishful thinking.It makes for titillating reading but unless the author can back up his claims it is all fiction and the reader should take it with a grain of salt."
1,Complete Nonsense!,"This is the second most discredited bio of Valentino, in my opinion, trailing just behind Kenneth Anger's funny but spurious ""Hollywood Babylon."" The author claims to be in the possession of Rudy's private diary and quotes from it episodes of passionate homosexual love. Long ago that ""diary"" was proven to be a fake, written by a distempered mind. The French-Canadian author, Jeanne de Recqville, carefully explored every sentence of that so-called diary, and demonstrated its numerous mistakes. Let the buyer beware! You'll learn more about the author of this horrible book than you ever will about Rudolph Valentino. It is nonsense like this which cheapens the art of Hollywood biography and discredits the veracity of those who think they are contributing to cinema history."
1,NOT WORTH A CENT...WASTE OF TIME & MONEY..DOES NOT EVEN DESERVE ONE STAR,"My father has a saying: DON'T BELIEVE EVERYTHING YOU READ OR HEAR AND ONLY BELIEVE HALF OF WHAT YOU SEE...Please don't waste your money on this book. I am really enjoying DARK LOVER by Emily W Leiber about the late and great Valentino....Whatever he was, all I know is he was an amazing actor and am sure a good man and deserves some respect...what a waste to die so young."
4,The book help me relize I'm not alone.,I felt the book very helpful because I had all kinds of feeling and thoughts and the book helped answer most of them. I'm glad she talked about if your mother was alive but had another mental or other problem such as alcohol. My mother was an alcoholic and I use to feel it was my fault and I had to be the perfect child even though I wasn't the oldest. I'm not just a motherless daughter but a fatherless one too. I wish it would have gone into the subject if both parents die early in your life. But I also realize it doesn't happen very often.
3,"A little less Freud, a litte more Buddha","I agree with much of the positive AND negative reviews about this book. I have no doubt that this book has been comforting and informative to many, and that books on this subject are rare.Like so many writers, though, Hope takes a worthy idea and runs and climbs and bike rides and sails with it, and .. well.. takes us on a kind of verbal triathlon that wore me out. I think this book could have been half the size, and twice as good.I also think her focus on young girls, with three pages devoted to adult loss, was something of a disservice. I don't think there is such a bright line between the grieving girl and the grieving adult.Most of all, I support the remarks of several reviewers who remind us: loss and grieving at ANY age is NOT pathological - it is part of life! A little less Freud (how did childhood screw us up?) and a little more Buddha (life is suffering!) would have made this book sing."
3,Motherless Daughters,"I thought this book was ok, but definitely geared towards women who lost their mothers at a young age - I am 33 and lost my mom 3 weeks ago. None of the content really helped me."
1,Can't Stand It Anymore!,I can't stand this movie anymore. I see it like four times a month! It's the same old thing. Boy moves to new town and falls in love with girl. Boy becomes part of nerdy paperboy brigade to pay for concert tickets from girl's ex-boyfriend. Boy and brigade take revenge on bullies with Home Alone-style pranks. Boy gets girl. Everyone's happy. The End! Just destroy every copy!
3,Not that bad,"The concept for this is good: give a 3d sound experience to the listener and try to immerse them in the story. Unfortunately, it has some trouble spots in the story. First of all, the story starts out incredibly slow and slightly confusing. Once you pick up on what's going on (basically, when Sulu comes in), it gets better. It IS a good story, and it's great to see Captain Sulu in action again...it's just too bad it takes some getting used to to really enjoy it."
3,Not bad but......,This is not a bad audio-book but it could have a little more work on the characters with alot more depth. The backgdround music was also anyoying.
1,Very Flimsy Product,I do not recommend this product. The handle broke within 10 minutes of first use. You have to be very close to the item you are attempting to spray. The cord kinks repeatedly and the stream from the hose is a light mist. The wheels do not roll easily unless you are on a smooth surface (ie not on a grassy area). I like the idea of a battery operated sprayer and one that rolls but this product does not perform as needed.
1,Useless picture quality,"The picture quality on this device is so awful that the camera is basically useless. It's not just sort of bad. The colours are drained, there's enormous halo, and the shutter is so slow even in bright light that you can't get a non-blurred picture. Most camera phones I've seen have much better picture quality, even if the resolution is lower. Avoid this gizmo."
4,Best Wearable Camera on the Market,"For a camera no bigger than your average USB Flash drive, this wearable camera developed by Philips is worth the money. If you want the ability to snap shots on the go with out the muss and fuss of size and having to focus, this is what you are looking for. Ultra compact is the best I can do to describe this camera. It's only drawbacks for me: No Flash, and start up time (more than 10 secs)."
4,A little too much money for the sound,"This is a pretty good sounding sytem if you do not play your music very loud. However I do not believe the price is adequet to match the product because when turned up to half the max volume the speakers start to crackle which becomes annoying after a while. If you are looking to pay $70-100 then buy a surround sound system because you get a lot more sound for the money. I am going to upgrade soon to a surround sound system because I listen to my music every day.Hightlights: decent sound, sleek looking, somewhat affordable,wall mountablecons: crackling sound when turned up"
1,OOB failure,"I'd like to think that when something is ""refurbished"" that they at least tried to plug it in and see if it works before sending it out - but apparently nobody did, because the one I received was dead on arrival. It powered up, but none of the transport controls or function controls on the front panel worked, and I couldn't get the stereo to play a CD, the radio, or anything at all. Returned it for money back. What a shame."
5,very good anthology of short stories,"i had read this as a teenager and was looking to find it for quite some time now. That's when i found nearly every one in the series. These books are wonderful and i will have them for some time to come. Love the Borderlands series. Heard there is a 6th one coming out, and that blew my mind!"
4,,I had trouble getting this unit to level out in all directions. I could zero in the bubble in one direction then turn it 180 degrees it just didn't work for me. There was nothing automatic about it. I took the unit to my county surveyer's office with no better results. The manual was inaduquate I mailed it back before the 30 days were up. I still need one.
2,"Buy ""Ravenna Art and History"" instead","The text in this book is identical to that inRAVENNA: Art and History. The difference lies in the number of color illustrations, of which the latter has significantly more. This book primarily has black and white illustrations, and the pages suffer from foxing (browning) over time.To get a real feeling for the quality of Ravenna's mosaics, use the Image search function in Google. Even better, go to the ParadoxPlace website."
2,Not very informative,"As a VoiceXML developer, I looked forward to this book. I was disappointed. Too much time was spent speculating on Version 2.0 and not enough time explaining Version 1.0. If you are looking to learn VoiceXML this is not the book."
2,Not so informative.,I can find more information on the internet on this subject than reading this book. In fact I turned to the internet while reading this book for answers to the questions this book failed to answer.
1,Do not buy this jacket,"I have bought this L size jacket on 4/15/07, on picture it's looks fine. I have supposed to present it to my son.Jacket's description is very short and not clear.But I was disappointed when I got it. $292 price and so tricky1. It is not ""Heavy duty antique brass zipper"" - zipper looks like for children jacket.Just small size zipper and working very tight. Looks like it will works for 2-3 months only. And after that the jacket could be wasted.2. The real jacket (L) chest size is 52"" - and there is disproportion, a man looks like balloon.3. Made in India.I have returned this jacket to seller, and spend $44.00 for that.$15 - postage and insurance;$29 - restocking charges (10%) - on Amazon there is no info about 10% restocking charges.I have discussed these issues with seller - by his opinion all of them are not defects!!!Do not buy this jacket."
3,Some good ideas but some flaws too.,"I can see how this idea can help you take control of an out-of-control parent/child relationship, but I wasn't comfortable giving my child so many warnings before I took action. I'd rather go from 1 to the 'Magic' without repeating myself. I'd also recommend Kid Cooperation (How to Stop Yelling, Nagging and Pleading) by Elizabeth Pantley and her new book, too."
5,It really is MAGIC!,I highly recommend this book for parents and grandparents. This method worked on disciplining my grandchildren when nothing else did. It was like magic.
2,Does it deserve an award at Cannes just because it's French?,"Absolutely not! I am a BIG fan of international films, everywhere from Cannes, to Bollywood. This film absolutely does not deserve any of the good publicity it recieved. I've had tooth extractions done that I would rather have been to rather than watch this again. It is slow, immature, and uncaring. The concept had so much potential, and this story could have been so much more. But something got lost in translation, that something is a good storyline."
3,Winning Days is great!,"The cd Winning Days by The Vines is great. Ever since I heard there single Get Free from Highly Evolved, I've been addicted to this phenominal band. The songs ""Ride"", ""TV Pro"", and ""F.T.W."" are great. Those songs tell the world they are goin to stay for a long time and nobody can do anything about it. Unlike there last album this album has more of a postive mood to it. Songs such as ""Autumn Shade II"", ""Rainfall"", and ""Sun Child"" bring that mood up. So, get a copy of this album."
4,theyre winning indeed,i bought this cd just a few days ago and must tell how i am completely blown away! this album fails to dissapoint! these songs are truly the best ive heard in a long time. the only sad part is amnesia its to slow and not enough lyrics .all in all this is a very good album a great release to start 2004!
4,an AMAZING sound,"The Vines f**cking rock!! and are totally talented at what they do, unlike some other plastic bands nutured and spewed out by record companies to make money off of. The Vines are real, and their music is really something worth checking out.P.S. For the guy who took up more than half the page writing up his torturted thoughts on the album, go get a life!"
2,Interesting - not convincing.,"This book is, at best, an exercise to boost the author's faith in their version of history after it has taken such an obvious hit. They quickly mention there is nothing strange about da Vinci's ""The Last Supper,"" yet it is obviously full of oddities. Moreover, they use the fact that Brown (author of DVC) uses ""Da Vinci"" instead of ""da Vinci"" or ""Leonardo"" as an attack on his credibility, which is weak to say the most.If these arguments aren't convincing, then this book isn't for you; it is disappointing and non-debunking. It is a hoax."
2,2 STARS FOR FUEL AND NORAH JONES,"PLEASE AVOID THIS AWFUL DANCE CD FULL OF AWFUL SONGS BY AWFULAND FORGETTABLE ARTISTS LIKE BRITNEY,JESSICA SIMPSON AND MORE.THE ONLY LISTENABLE SONGS ARE FROM FUEL AND NORAH JONES.NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL.AVOID."
1,BOOOOOOO,"Sucky CD,but there's a few good songs on it,like Feeling This,I Hate Everything About You and Stand Up.Other then that,this is just full of junky pop junk or slow,boring songs that make you wanna take a nap."
3,NOW 16: First Impressions,"This one could have definitely been better. It's good to see OutKast on a NOW, but why so late? Blink-182, R. Kelly, Modest Mouse, Kanye West and Usher are all missing, despite chart succsess. Gretchen Wilson, Three Days Grace, Petey Pablo and Juvenile are all too recent and minor on top of just being plain horrible. Props however, do go to NOW for including good songs despite having ties to religion, (Switchfoot, Los Lonely Boys) as well as FINALLY including Eminem and the overlooked (but wonderfully catchy) Beenie Men single Dude."
3,Schubert A little too fast,"Trio No. 2 is passionate but not agitated music...it requires space and, more importantly, time. This performance gives it too little of either. Otherwise, the material on this CD is well-played."
5,beachs,"this was probably the best one. i loved it. you get to see a lot more action, not all is the roughnecks. And more bug.........bigger....meaner......SMARTER....."
3,"Inferior to Pluto, Tophet and Tesca, but still a KEEPER","LISTEN UP APES!Beware of the filmmaker's commentary track during the fourth episode. It contains a HUGE SPOILER about what happens in episode 35 out of 40, which I haven't seen. And I am furious! I admit, I should have seen it coming since it's in the book and the movie, but it was exciting not knowing how the show would follow (or not follow) the turning points in the book. If you're a newbie fan like me, I suggest you don't let this happen to you.Hydora isn't horrible - a keeper, no doubt - but it definately lacks the emotional depth of Tesca and the thrilling excitement of Tophet. The animation is of the same quality as the others, but duplicating water on CGI is nearly impossible. And the whole planet is made up of... WATER. The animators bit off more than they could chew.Buy this one for the last episode in which Carl's psychic powers are developed. The last few images are highly poignant."
1,disappointing,"Sorry, but I was very disappointed. I read the glowing reviews, and as a medieval mystery addict and Chaucer fan, I was really looking forward to it. However, I found the level of writing to be mediocre. Having read the Canterbury Tales, I found the author's re-tellings very dull. Certainly not worth $[price]."
2,herky-jerky,"This was the strangest writing that Stella Cameron has ever done. I kept thinking I was turning too many pages...that's how herky-jerky the writing and plot were. I would go back and see that I had not missed anything...this was a annoying book to read. I don't know who the editor was on this book, but that person should be fired. And Cameron should be embarassed. Sonnie was a whiny wimp, and the match between her and some hunk never added up."
3,Six days mix,the song playing over the end credits is a mix of two DJ shadow songs; six days and another track off of private press. Does anyone know where I could find that version that mixes both songs?
4,"Simple, technical, to the point.","The strengths of this book, in my opinion, is the well rounded coverage of technical issues regarding film production. This is not one of those guides which convinces you that it can squeeze scriptwriting, production, casting, postproduction, distribution, and even film appreciation (by giving you a ""favorite films"" list at the end of the book). This book deals almost completely with technical terms and techniques, which is probably the only issue in filmmaking that can be sufficiently covered in one book. Ofcourse, you will need on hand training, but you can always get your hands on a good old 16mm soviet camera for around $150 or a super8 camera for next to nothing (I did). This books only faults: It's a bit old (1972) and visually it's a bit dull (though there are plenty of b&W pictures and charts). I enjoyed Lipton's rather intimate writing: it feels a lot more like an literal explaination than a textbook."
4,Great movie for the true crime buff!,"This is a great true crime dvd. I love the way it was constructed, intertwining different points of view as to what occured on Wonderland Ave.What puzzles me is ""Where do I get the book about this murder that was advertised on the Court TV clip?"" It's called ""Four On The Floor"", and was written by Robert Souza and Tom Lange, both LAPD detectives. Can't locate it anywhere."
3,How did I miss this the first time around,"Porn, Sex, Drugs, Murder, Val Kilmer. I think Val Kilmer and Lisa Kudrow did amazing jobs being John and Sharon Holmes. The movie uses actual footage from the police files in the Wonderland murders and it is a bit gruesome in spots. Would recommend if you are interested in the darker side of 1970's Hollywood. I enjoyed it."
4,"NHL 08, a great game with many bugs",This is a very good game that is very life-like. The load times are horrible and you cannot download roster updates or the system will frequently freeze. The game is fun and I would like for EA to release an update to fix all of their bugs.
4,A Beautiful CD,"The CD is a recording of the songs in the play The Beautiful Game. It follows a Catholic boys soccor team in 1969 Ireland. The story has wonderful songs with lots of excitement surrounding a winning season of soccor and the turmoil of the day. The lyrics on the company songs are a bit hard to understand and the dialect is sometimes different, but the CD is wonderful! The album jacket can help with the storyline and it is well worth the effort. I highly recommend this CD,"
2,Nice bits until the bearing set screw fell off and the bearing went flying across the room!,I got this set for a specific project that needed the bearing out at the end of the bit to move against a pattern. Hadn't used it more then 3 minutes and the set screw that holds the bearing in place unscrewed and let the bearing go flying and my router bit no longer could track to the pattern and severely gouged my work piece.Amazingly I found the bearing and the set screw and put all the parts back in the bag and returned it. They should at least come tight from the factory!
4,Very nice set.,"I haven't used them yet, but they look real good . Each one came in it's own reusable storage pouch. That's a nice plus."
2,NOT ACCEPTABLE!,"Accept without Udo is like Led Zep without Robert Plant, it's just not the same. Not that David Reece is a bad singer mind you, but Udo is THE voice of Accept. I cannot recommend this CD to any hardcore Accept fans. The only track on it that I like and that kicks butt is the track D-Train. It's a scorcher. Save your money and get METAL HEART, BALLS TO THE WALL, or RESTLESS AND WILD instead. [...]"
3,ITS COLD IN ACCEPT,Come on with out Udo there is no Accept. These is not reastless & wild but it is reastless and week.Don't give your cash to this trash.
2,Was a good laptop for about 6 months,"After about 6 months I noticed mass amounts of heat emitting from this laptop to dangerous levels, it could burn your hand!!! Fan runs non stop for some reason and it required external cooling espessially when runnning VISTA which this unit has major trouble handleing. I broght this piece of crap back and got a Macbook Pro with Leopard....so much better!"
4,Very Nice Overview,This was a quick enjoyable read which provides an overview of options. This is a good first book to read to see if you want to invest more time studying.
5,Will turn you into a history buff!,"AMAZING read! I have never been interested in History of any sort before and afte reading a bit about her on Wikipedia I couldn't wait to learn more! She is fascinating, flaws and all! This book gave a wonderful outline of the time period, the rulers in charge and the goverment, but loaded with interesting facts and how her life had impacted so much of that time period. It proved to me that times were not too different back then as they are now with sex, drugs, affairs, addictions and celebrity obsession. I couldn't put this book down and after finishing it you'll want to look for book on her fascinating friends and aquaintences as well! It's a must buy even for the uninterested in history, couldn't tell you the dates of the civil war type of person"
1,Good insomnia reading,"After reading the reviews, I expected an exciting and well-written book. Instead, I find that after reading two pages, I'm ready to go to sleep.The book is a string of quotes from letters and journals with a bit of text in between, not really a biography.I'm halfway through and I give up. I'm not finishing the book."
4,"Perfect Biography, Disastrous Life","18th Century is not my favorite period in the history... Georgiana is not the type of person whom I respect and admire... Still, the book, the way it was written, its style, they all kept me reading it until the end with an unprecedented zeal...This is a great history book, this is one of the very rare objective biographies, this is a must for all history lovers..."
2,I was bored out of my mind....,"Normally I love biographies and anything historical. I bought this book after seeing the movie, The Duchess. I was fascinated after seeing the movie and wanted to learn more about this woman. However, the book was wordy and my mind kept drifting. It was like being in school and reading a boring history book. I really did make an effort to get through it, but after the third chapter I put it away. It just didn't hold my attention. I'm giving it two stars for the illustrations."
4,"INTRICATE, INVOLVING SAGA OF A SOMETIMES DITZY LADY",At times the cast of characters in this biography gets one slightly lost and it is good that it has a reasonably full index. There are some intriguing photos of the scandalous goings-on and it is a generally good read.Timothy Wingate Ottawa CANADA
3,Difficult Read,"With all the ""sexy"" things that happened to the subject, this could have been much more interesting. Perhaps the author was showing restraint in not ascribing perceived emotions, reactions, etc. Foreman's research is amazing and she deserves credit for her hard work. However, the book is somewhat dry and hard to follow; I was skimming it toward the end."
3,A Lesson on English Politics History,"First, please be clear this is not a novel. It's a History text book.If you want to learn everything about English political campaigns during the adult life of The Dutchess, this is the book for you. But if you want to enjoy a well-written story about the lady herself, look elsewhere.This books is a chronological report, spliced together from public and private documents, letters and newspaper articles. There are 34 pages of footnotes, a bibliography, an index, a chronology and a family tree to keep track of sources, references and who's who.It really is a shame that someone has not used this vast historic record to write a real novel about the fascinating Dss of D. This is not it.If you decide to buy/read this, you will be asking yourself ""Is there a quiz at the end?"""
4,Murdoch on love and betrayal,"The Sacred and Profane Love Machine describes the spectacular unravelling of two families at the hands of Blaise Gavender. The first family is his own ""legitimate"" one, comprising his wife Harriet and son David. The other is his lover Emily and their son Luca. A weary and cynical novelist,the newly widowed Montague Small, is the unwilling observer and intermediary of this melange. We see a recurring exploration of the meaning of love when the faults of the lovers suddenly become overwhelming and the only options are forgiveness or alienation.As in her other books, Murdoch's characters are complex, their motivations tangled by alternating emotional currents of elation, despair, and futility."
3,Stick with Girl,"If you purchase Kevin Taylor's ""Fang"" expecting it to be similar to Girl or Jill then you are going to be disappointed. Taylor's anatomically impossible character are very suited to his adult erotica but they are not very well suited to traditional swords and sorcery.Although there are number of ""adult"" themes in the book - nudity, rape and bestiality - they are are only hinted at rather than actually drawn. This makes the book unsuitable for the 13-17 year old age range. For those 18+, the book will titillate but not deliver. Taylor should have stuck with straight porn.Sorry - because I love his other work."
3,New...No it wasn't!,"The condition of this product was very unsatisfactority! The spine has detattached from the book itself and the order when i placed the book said condition ""new"". I assumed that ""new"" meant it would be wrapped in sealing and not open until it has arrived to my house, clearly i was mistaken."
1,Track #29 Whoop there it is???? This is not Trance!!!,"I should have read the reviews before buying this CD set. I figured 2 discs, some fam names, 40 tracks, how bad could this be. Well...its bad. This is more like Trance Nation 2001. Almost all old tracks. Im in NY and even our Radio stations played out these tracks in 2002. This more like pop, fast fwded. One track has a girls vocals about her childhood in chipmunk voice (not kidding). I only liked 2 tracks from scooter and tiesto. I have trance cds from 1997 that put this CD to shame. My 3rd & last dissapointment with MOS so called trance collection. ticked... off in NY for spening [$+]."
3,WHAT!? This is NOT trance music.....................,"Last time I checked, whoomp there it is! was not trance music, these are all just remixes, etc. Come On MOS, now you know better than to call this Trance music......."
5,Great book - detailed and simple,This book is simple for the beginner and covers some advanced concepts for not the beginner. Overall a must read for a serious OO programmer/designer. I recommend reading this book as a first or second book on OO design. The case study is great.
5,The Big 5 are on here ..,"What do I mean? well the Big 5 in my opinion are Silas Hogan , Lazy Lester , Lightnin Slim, Lonesome Sundown , and Slim Harpo. I went out and Got all this stuff on Vinyl , back in 63 , in UK ..Via 2 LP's Authentic R&B , and The Real R&B .Those 2 records, were our Bible .. Only two gripes here .. the ROCKIN version of 'Im A Lover Not A Fighter'by Lazy Lester , has been replaced with the inferior alt' weaker take. To find the best version you have to track down Lazy Lesters ACE C.D . they have put the weaker take on the re- issue of Authentic R&B too .. why; I don't know ..Second gripe ..My home is A Prison' by Lonesome Sundown .. a Swamp Blues classic, should also be on here ..Nevertheless, 5 stars for the music here .."
3,waiting,"This book was great as far as helping singles remain content and to 'wait for the Lord'. However, I didn't sense too much of a conviction to remain pure during the dating relationship. It sounds as if the author knows several singles being immoral. Why is it being accepted and tolerated? We need to hold each other accountable and help others to maintain their purity, because the couple will have a more confident and God-centered relationshiop."
5,"After 11 years, Help has arrived","It has been a decade since I have had a vacation, gone any distance from my home or gone places with friends feeling free and confident. I have been to four doctors, specialists, been part of a scientific study and still had no control. In three days I saw improvement by following these easy to follow guidelines. I am getting my life back. I have recommended this book to the university doing the study, and my doctors are anxious to see it. It is so easy, and the answer right there all the time. Also, the footnotes back up the science, which is important to me."
4,Excellent IBS Resource,"This book really helped me to understand what I needed to do right now! My gastroenterologist recommends this book to his patients (his wife has IBS). It's a must read for the newly diagnosed, like me, that provides practical tables and grocery lists to aid in your lifestyle changes. The herbal teas suggested here really work!!!"
4,Lorrie and Sammy at their finest?,"I've owned this CD since it came out over a year ago and I just decided to start posting reviews on this CD, among others. Lorrie has such a pure distinct voice that it's a shame she is without a doubt one of the most underrated country singers of all time. Sammy also has such a distinct voice and I find the two are able to pull off an amazing duet. So good, that a CD chocked full of duets was no problem for these two. 'He Drinks Tequila' obviously steals the album as far as the 'fun & fast' song goes while 'I Finally Found Someone' holds the 'slow ballad' of sorts top spot. Other lead songs include 3 Seconds, 29 Again, Sad City, Big Time, & Sugar. Overall, I rate it 4 out of 5 stars simply because Sammy's voice seems to be lacking in a few of the solo songs. It's a must have for either Sammy fans or Lorrie fans."
5,I finally found someone Lorrie Mogan & Sammy Kershaw,"I finally found some-one,Lorrie Morgan,& Sammy Kershaw,this is the first CD I have of theirs and delighted with it,the songs are all good,I actually bought another one to give away to a friend.Excellent choice for some-one Bette"
2,Disappointing Lorrie,"I have been a Lorrie fan since her first CD, ""LEAVE A LIGHT ON"" (still her masterpiece), and her albums have become progressively more uninspired over the years, bringing us up-to-date to this dull duets project. I'm certainly happy that Lorrie has found love (though I seem to recall her saying that many times over the last 10 years or so), I just wish she would find some musical inspiration."
4,the charmed action figure paige,the paige action figure is a nice collectors item for any lover of charmed and it is a tricky decision whether to take it out of the box or not. i have all the charmed figures now and each figure comes with a portion of the infamous attic when combined with the other portions will complete the whole attic playset!i would give the paige doll 8 out of 10.
3,Good but too dadgum jumpy for me,"I love John Varley's books. I have read all of them now. I really, really wanted to totally love this book too. However, the book is just too jumpy. I was always getting lost and I don't like getting lost (and I hate to admit it since I'm a guy).OK, unpronounceable name book does explain the premise behind _The_Steele_Beach_ and _The_Golden_Globe_. I gotta give it that, but, no four stars."
5,Beautiful writing.,"No one writing today surpasses Kate Walbert in beauty of style. I think the 'editorial reviews' miss the point in judging the later stories in this volume. What they perceive as 'disjointed narrative' is actually a master painting emotions and events using an economy of brushstrokes in carefully interlaced fashion. Criticizing her for this technique reminds me of the academicians in Paris who couldn't comprehend the Impressionists. The story ""1980 Florence"" is a true masterpiece. I recommend Walbert heartily to any readers who want to experience the very best in contemporary writing."
2,Where She Went,"I was disappointed in the outlay of the story. The ending seemed to be unresolved. It is the only writing I have read by Kate Walbert, perhaps it is just a style that does not work for me. The actual condition of the book was satisfactory and the price was good and shipping was timely."
5,I loved this book!,This was an excellent book! I laughed out loud several times during the first half. I felt as though Paul somehow secretly observed our department since many of the examples were so personal and real life. The book has many suggestions that can be immediately put into use. I am at Amazon so I can order copies for my boss and my boss' boss!
5,Excellent book for real estate appraisers!,"I purchased this book to assist me in a course I am taking in Advanced Income Capitalization. It is undoubtly the best book on the market for using the HP-12C for real estate problems. Not only is this a great book, but I had the opportunity to communicate with the author on several occasions, and he is indeed "" a scholar and a gentleman"". I highly recommend this book for all real estate appraisers."
5,An amazing Book!,"This is a very interesting and informative book about the catholic faith, faith in general and god."
3,a bit interesting,"Not sorry I read it, but wouldn't recommend it unless someone wanted very light reading on modern shamanic practices."
2,Lord of the Rings Fellowship and Two Towers,"I bought these two soundtracks at a local retail store. The ones I have came in leather bound cd cases. I love the music. Unfortunately, I had a VERY difficult time getting the music to play on computer dvd and cd-writer drives. This may be something to keep in mind when buying them, especially if they are being bought as a gift."
4,Magical,"In just days, my local Barnes & Noble nearly sold out its floor display of Born to Fly. While I rarely went beyond reading romance books, I loved this book. This book's foundation in reality, not fantasy, didn't diminish its magical literary power. It's much more interesting than Mark Twain.Pilot-turned-Author Mr. Osborne, who's as handsome as Tom Cruise in Top Gun, reminds us that our world's exploding with danger. The description of his experience is intense. This book will lead to a whole generation of young Americans discovering the world outside of our continent."
3,Good read but could have been better,"I enjoyed the book of nonfiction and the subject matter of the love of flying. Even though the subtitle is cliche, (many of us pilots feel this way) nevertheless, the author details why he feels the way he does about flying. Author seems to soft peddle his accomplishments and actions in China, but some more detail would have been appreciated. Should have had more input from fellow detainees. But a good, quick read."
1,Self-indulging propaganda,"Instead of being portrayed as a hero, Shane Osburn should be brought up on charges of having endangered the lives of his crew and turning over classified machinery to the Chinese. The book belongs in the 99 cent store."
2,American Military Propaganda,"The most inspiring thing said by the author and which I will remember most from this book was that drugs are for losers.I sure would have liked to see how the author justifies how his own country enforces a 200-mile defense zone beyond its borders while expecting everyone else to obey the international (except for the U.S., apparently) 12-mile zone."
5,There's no better book on the subject!,"ok, so of course the Bible has it beat, but it's 2nd only to It on the subject. :-)I also found this book to be a perfect complement to fasting as you watch the Lord ""move Heaven and Earth through your prayers"". If you struggle with the question in your mind, ""why do I pray if God is sovereign and knows my thoughts anyway?"" you need to get this book.It's probably #3 in my top 10 reading list."
1,So Much Rubbish,"If this wasn't John Lennon no one would give it a second listen. I won't even get into the ""non-music"" sounds of Yoko. I am a Beatles fan and like most of Lennon's solo stuff, but come on, this band was thrown together and obviously none of the members was at the top of their game for this concert. The songs are rushed and sloppy and Lennon's voice sounds terrible. This one is strictly for completists."
3,Good for travel with Frio coolers,"I've used this case a couple of times for travel with insulin and diabetic supplies. It works as advertised and does a nice job providing plenty of room for Frio pouches in the outer mesh pocket. It's a bit pricey for what it is (a square black nylon bag with a mesh outer pocket and space inside for storage), however. Two other nits I have with this bag are: First, it is extremely easy for pickpockets to unzip (lost a glucometer that way once). A twist tie or other device is needed to keep the double zipper pulls secured to each other to make it just that much more difficult for thieves to open. Secondly, the shoulder strap is minimal at best and not comfortable for all day use (e.g., on a hike). In the end, though, the large outer mesh pocket makes up for those issues and makes this an essential travel/day pack for those who need to carry cooled medication and supplies."
1,total bias,"I can't believe that he claims to be fair to both sides in this book. I am a Florida resident and this past election, I voted for all democrats expect for the presidential race, in which I voted for Bush. If for some reason my ballot got tossed and they couldn't make out my vote for ""prez"", would ""they"" assume that since I voted for all democrats in the local and state races that I had intended to vote for Gore. I think not!! People have a responsibility to learn how to vote. I thought this book was pretty stupid and very biased towards making the republicans out to be a bunch of crooks. I also don't believe Blacks were stopped at checkpoints to be prevented from voting. Jeffrey Toobin is a terrible writer"
2,not a bad work of fiction,"too bad that such an important subject was handled in such a biased way. even worse is that the facts were either only particaly used or twisted to fit the point mr. toobin was trying to make at the time. everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but not their own facts. this book should classified as fiction and not non-fiction."
1,Anything for money,Unfounded criticism of a system that worked. Biased in his writing. Thought he would join the others in trying to make a buck. Now we know the truth any way. New studies show Bush would have won no matter how it went
2,Disappointing.,This book is very expensive for what it is - basically a picture book without much real information.
3,Good for the Keys; not Key West,"This is a good map for the Florida Keys, the 100-plus mile stretch from Key Largo to Key West, except for Key West. Considering many folks traveling the Keys are headed to Key West, Key West (especially Old Town) deserves more than a 2 by 3-inch space. Key West is a walking town, dense with attractions, and a bit off-kilter; you need more map. The Rand McNally Fabmap (cloth) and the MapEasy maps are better.Marsh Muirhead - author of ""Key West Explained- a guide for the traveler."""
4,versatile storage item,I got the Redmon Original Bongo Bag (camouflage) as alternative storage for my son's stuffed animals. It holds almost all of them and it's discreet in the corner of the room. It helps me keep toys off the floor and out of sight. I think it's more often used as a hamper but lighter-weight toys are fine for its design. Great product.
4,Very nice!!,"It 's a very particular watch, although it has only the basic functions its futuristic design makes it a very fun and stylish watch."
4,Down Right Divine,"The Village Poet opened me up to new thoughts and ideas. The Poet is so real, deep and profound. This book is perfect for all people because it tells us what we need to do to have an effective life and society. It is clearly shown that the poet has a great deal of passion and well being for his people. I agree with the poet that we all must strive for perfection and the only failure is when you have failed yourself. The Poet says, kindness is not a weakness, but a virtue. People tell me I am too nice all the time, but when I can help someone I fell I have done a Godly act. Just a few pages of the Village Poet have given me a wiser outlook on life than I had earlier today."
5,larger than original wilton,"we wanted another wilton pan to match two we already had. this one was supposed to be the right size. to our surprise, it was about a half inch larger in both directions, allowing the older pans to easily nest or fit inside this one and slide around a tiny bit.It's a great pan with a great finish to have cookies and veggies not stick to the surface, just a tad larger than it states. If i could convince my spouse to upgrade the other two older wilton pans we have to this one, we'd have one killer baking set!Excellent product though."
1,Rubbish,"I began reading this book advised that it was full of inaccuracies, but still I was surprised by just how pitiful this book is. Not only is it full of inaccuracies and poorly researched, the writing is horrible. If you can get your hands on a copy, Orlo Miller's The Donnellys Must Die is a better--although hardly ""authoritative""--introduction to the whole Donnelly thing."
1,A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY,"Anyone even remotely interested in the facts surrounding the murders of the Donnellys of Biddulph Township, Ontario should avoid this book at all costs. The true story is as gripping as it gets, why sensationalize it. Why Kelley produced this piece of rubbish in the first place, why he chose to demonize the Donnellys in isolation, and why the book continues to be so popular escapes me. Two very worthwhile books are available, both well researched and as accurate as the situation and politics of the area permit. ""The Donnelly Album"" by Ray Fazakas is highly recommended as it contains innumerable period photos of the Donnellys and the area around Lucan. ""The Donnellys Must Die"" by Orlo Miller is a well researched and balanced account of the whole situation."
4,Excellent,I have read this book about 3 times and I think that it gets more interesting every time. I think that the Donnellys were made to look maby a bit more evil then they really were but I also think that Mr. Kelley did an above average job of writing this intreging and spine tingleing novel... It is also exciting that this happened so close to my home town of Tillsonburg.. I recommend this book to anyone who likes true stories and is not scared of murders lies and severe beatings...
4,Excellent read for all descendants of Ontario,"The book is a great read for all residents of Ontario, as it represents a crucial and interesting part in our history. When you are finished reading the book, you will fell compelled to visit the town of Lucan. Just to see if the eeriness that apparently exists, actually does."
4,Occasional brilliance,"As you read this book, it will feel like a conversation with yourself. Some things are very conclusive. Given the starting point, you will reach the same conclusions as the author and not be very surprised to read the same.. as there is not much variation possible, especially when we are talking about limiting ideas like truth. The book wont seem an interesting read until your definitions are challenged or you have been introduced to a question like as Adler asks,""What, then,leads one to philosophy in the middle- not as clearly in the sphere of truth as mathematics and experimental science, nor as clearly in the sphere of taste as styles of cuisine or dress?""This is a book which you can read years later and still find that it has something new to offer."
1,Save yourselves,"This book is a must have for anyone who has never had an independent thought in their life. I couldn't keep my eyes open trying to read this book. For anyone who thinks on their own from time to time, this book contains chapter after torturous chapter of common sense information, spelling out the most fundamental ideas over painful lengths of text. If you have never thought about anything, ever, and would like for the first time to try it out, then this book might be a useful guide for you. My apologies to the authors of glowing reviews on this book, but you should have recommended a toaster and a bathtub to go with it."
4,"Good presentation, although a little short.","Great concert! I especially liked that Jorge Luis, one of the vocalists, seems to be very drunk, lol! The only downside is that it's only 10 songs, so it's short. If you like La Arrolladora, definitely buy this DVD.---------------Excelente concierto! Me encantó que el Jorge Luis, uno de los vocalistas, parece estar bien pedo, jaja! Le agrega un no-sé-qué. Lo único es que se me hizo corto: sólo 10 canciones. Pero definitivamente, si les gusta La Arrolladora, es muy buena compra."
2,Indonesian Lonely Planet,The publishing date was 1997 and this was not clearly communicated. For travel information this is sadly out of date and renders the book nearly usless. Lonely Planet is a great book but this choice at Amazon for me was not a good one.
2,Irritating,"This is an irritating CD for a couple of reasons. Many of the songs have what sounds like a pretty cool guitar riff, but it gets buried in all the muddy lo-fi noise. The songs are sung in an emotionless monotone with some effect that makes them sound disembodied. If one song were done this way, it might be effective, but the entire CD drones on, each song sounding pretty much like the previous one. I think there are some decent songs here that would be entertaining done by another band."
1,This Actually Sells?,"The Raveonettes' ""Whip It On"" is the only CD I have ever returned to the store.How could anyone LIKE this album? Every single song, with the exception of ""Bowels of the Beast"" sounds exactly like ""Attack of the Ghost Riders."" It's a total waste of money unless you like listening to the same song on repeat for twenty minutes. The tempo, key, and general ""sound"" of each song is identical, and it drove me nuts after about three tracks.To be fair, ""Bowels of the Beast"" IS a bit different from the other seven tracks. But it's a ... song for a .... album. The Raveonnetes take the meaning of ""one-hit wonder"" to a whole new level.Nice try, Raveonettes, but you won't fool everyone with your hype."
4,black cadillacs and cigarettes,"The Raveonettes saved rock and roll again. As the rock monster grows old and weary, she needs a shot of adrenaline every now and again. This time it came from Denmark. Comparisons to the Jesus and Mary Chain are fair--sometimes they even manage a My Bloody Valentine thing(just in case you want more songs that sound like 'You Made Me Realize'). Rockin'. Makes you wanna knock off liquor stores. Bring on the Ghost Riders..."
1,"BUGGY AND BROKEN, DO NOT BUY!!!","This game is incredibly buggy and broken. The game stutters, crashes,and bsod's more than frequently, assuming you can get the game to start. My copy of the game I got from gamestop couldnt even start, due to a ram error that states I have under 610mb of RAM. I actually have 2gb, and I have windows xp. Its up to you, but I dont think 50 bucks is worth a shiny coaster and a nice little box. Dont buy this game!Not to mention this game also ILLEGALLY installs SecuRom on your pc, without your consent, or even knowledge. SecuRom will slow down your pc, and run all processes through itself. It can be blocked with Kaspersky, or other advanced security clients, but the only true way to remove it is to wipe your hard drive.50 bucks for a broken, malware infected coaster. Not worth it!"
5,One of the best games I've played,"This was a truly awesome game. One of the major highlights is a destructible environment. Almost everything (see cons) is destructible. Also, the game keeps the destruction until you quit. The plot is pretty good, as are SOME of the lines (a few were extremely good). In addition, since the players are mercs, you can work for almost any company/ organization. Overall, this is definitely a five star game at a great price.Cons:Rocks can't be destroyed, even by tanks/C4in-game tutorial (directions and such) repeat every time the game startsCan't keep vehicles between playing seasons"
2,Contains the most inane song ever written!,"I guess this CD really isn't all that bad, and there's no real reason why it flopped as hard as it did.But I can't believe somebody actually wrote and sang, with a straight face, ""Goodbye Carmen"" - about how sad it is when the maid gets deported."
1,Vast Malarky,"I found this book to be a dreary rehash of the legal briefs and excuses of Clinton's vast coterie of apologists. I did not find a single new fact in it on this sordid chapter in our history. Mr.Toobin swallows wholesale the spin of Clinton defenders, and passes it off as his own reporting, providing NO footnotes or attributions. He also, obviously, has stolen whole passages left and right from Uncovering Clinton, the definitive book on this subject written by the journalist Michael Isikoff. Yet, Mr. Toobin has the audacity to portray Mr. Isikoff--an objective reporter who painstakingly detailed his sourcing and ethical struggles in covering the story--in a negative light. This is an appalling piece of pseudo-journalism that deserves quick oblivion."
3,NOT LOVECRAFT'S BEST,"I guess THE BEST OF H.P. LOVECRAFT spoiled me. When I got to this book, I found the stories not near as frightening or appealing. There are some fragments in this book, though, and the most important thing is that they ARE fragments. No pastiche authors here, thank you. Then there's a part of the book showing off some of HPL's earlier work. It's interesting to compare his earlier work with his later work, to see how he matured as a writer. By the way, did you know that HPL ghost-wrote a story for HARRY HOUDINI? I didn't either, until I read this book. I give this book 3 stars because I feel that only books that are TRULY OUTSTANDING deserve 4 or 5 stars. Only books that are absolutely terrible and have no merit deserve 1 or 2. So I give this book a conservative 3 stars."
2,Misleading - doesn't support USB audio,"As a USB hub this is great, however the description and packaging are misleading. I was looking for a a hub that had built in sound. Despite what the description says, this is not what you get. It comes with a cord to plug the hub into your speaker and microphone ports on the computer, then you plug your speakers and microphones into the hub. Not sure exactly what problem that solves. I was hoping to have only one cord to plug/unplug when I wanted to take my laptop and go."
5,Best Hub,"There are some very good reviews here and around the web on this hub. I'm convinced this is the best powered USB hub on the market. I have bought 2 of these a couple months ago and they have been working flawlessly. I have also used the D-link DUB-H7 which is a good hub but is no where near this hub in terms of features and performance. Excellent power levels when running power demanding devices. Connects all devices without conflict, whether heavily dependent on power or not. The 7 high bandwidth USB 2.0 ports won't hinder each others performance, especially during multi-device data transfer. 2 power always on ports for charging devices. It is always possible to get a lemon, if you do don't give up on this hub, buy from a reputable dealer selling consumer quality products not returns, OEMs or grey market."
4,You get what you pay for.,"This is a nice toddler bed, my daughter loves it, but it isn't the sturdiest available. My kids have done a little bit of jumping on it without destroying it, but if you are looking for something more substantial then look at something else. With a little luck she will outgrow it before it breaks. If not then it was only $60."
5,Killer Album!,"This is a great metal/rock album. The vocals are by Garm from Ulver. It's a very heavy medium paced record, very 90's. If you follow Ulver, or Garm's work buy this album."
4,There's a party going down at the rock and roll show.,"This is a good compilation of Beach Boys songs. But there are a few curious choices made in song selection. Why is the minor b-side ""409"" included when there are many bigger hits that were left off? Don't get me wrong, I love ""409"", but it's not a ""greatest hit"". But the main fault here is the inclusion of two mediocre new recordings at the end of the CD. Still, it's easy to find a cheap used copy of this, so it's worth getting."
5,A must read for any investor,Understanding your psychological biases and exerting self-control strategies to mitigate those biases is extremely important tool for the novice to the most experienced investor to employ.
3,"Not the best TKK, but enjoyable","Gay Black & Married is almost what you'd expect TKK to release - a sleazy disco album about sex and drugs, right? This one delivers there - yet it has a feel at times that it was too forced, not well thought out enough.In my opinion, some of these songs go on entirely too long and get redundant which takes away from the enjoyment.A great track which I find myself repeating is ""One Night Stand"", a track that sounds completely from the 1980's but has an awesome ebb and flow of synths and dance rhythms, with no vocals. A must for die hard fans but not essential."
4,It's Heavy Duty Alright...,"Love it! I've dropped it a ton of times and still not a scratch - gotta love that ""for hard working men"" quality! :) And it's a thermos so ofc it does it's job well! Burnt my mouth on my vanilla chai on MANY occasions! haha! It keeps my drinks cold AND hot for 5 hours AT LEAST. The only downside is the lid is a little leaky - so if it tips or jumbles around in your car fluid will start to appear around the inside rim of the lid (where you drink). But as far as sturdy material and functionality goes - it's wonderful! It just can't go in my backpack when I ride my motorcycle (fear of tipping over), but for everything else, it's a lifesaver and VERY DURABLE!"
2,Small base seems unstable when full of hot coffee,"The mug keeps my coffee hot for a long time, Good. But the small bottom of the mug makes me feel like it could easily be toppled over and spill hot coffee all over my lap, Bad.5 Stars if this mug will live in a cup holder. 2 Stars if you drink your coffee by expensive computer equipment and are kind of clumsy."
3,"Decent, but not great. this mug/cup doesn't live up to the ""Thermos"" brand reputation","To me, this mug/cup doesn't live up to the ""Thermos"" brand reputation.The lid isn't leak proof. Leak resistant..sure. If the cup is tilted, liquid does leak out slowly.Hot Coffee only stays HOT for only about 15 minutes. It stays warm about 15 more. I think the flaw in the design in the plastic liner. While it is easy to clean, it just doesn't hold the heat in. By contrast, I've got a THERMOS brand THERMOS(all metal, double wall), that keeps coffee HOT for 12-16 hours. That's the kind of quality I was expecting(heck, keeping it just WARM for a 1 hour would have made me happy). This mug/cup let me down. It's decent, but not great."
4,Cute read,"This really is an adorable read for anyone who is a dog lover and also needs a little motivation in their professional or personal lives. I liked how the author related dog experiences to a person's every day life challenges. For example, in one chapter the author discussed how a dog is just happy to see you when you get home from work, the store, where ever. The dog doesn't tell you about his day; how his toy rolled under the couch and he couldn't reach it, then this happened and that... I found this book to be humorous and entertaining - hopefully you will too!"
1,"A review of Format, Not This Amazing Speech","There are surely many who would like to own a copy of the Gettysburg Address. Read with an understanding of the times, one can't help but be moved by the eloquence of Lincoln's words, and the careful crafting that made this one short speech, so memorable.What I am reviewing here is the Free ""Vanilla Electronic Text"" version of the speech which is available for Kindle. Though serviceable, I can't recommend it. For whatever reason, the publishers have chosen to replace commas with elipses. So that you get:Quote:Now we are engaged in a great civil war ... testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated ... can long endure.REALLY?!?Available elsewhere, for free.Pam T~mom/history lover"
3,I was just curious about the speech as I knew it was quite short.,I would recommend this to anyone interested in history. Also my husband and I had toured the town of Gettysburg PA.
5,Gettsburg Address,"What President Lincoln wrote is history and is the all time speech for generations and generations to come. I am so glad that I downloaded it and every so often I read it. He really didn't think, at the time, that his speech would ever be remembered or quoted. He was able to think and write with such passion. Everyone should keep this speech."
4,Looks to be fine,"I haven't had to read this book yet for my class, but it seems to be in good shape. I believe it was a used copy...looks fine."
1,Don't even bother,"I couldn't even finish this book. After wading through page after page of two characters trying to dispose of a body, I was so bored I couldn't go on. Their actions were completely unrealistic and silly. If you've just killed someone and you're trying to figure out how to dispose of the body, do you think you'd be preoccupied with sex and fantasizing??? Laymon wrote like a 12-year old with raging hormones. I know his novels are known for their gratuitous sex and violence, but when the sex gets in the way of the story, it's too much. If you're looking for a good read, please look elsewhere..."
1,BITE (much as I was hoping otherwise) pretty much bites,"I was really looking forward to reading BITE after hearing about other Richard Laymon books that are mostly out of print (or simply unavailable) in the US. The writing is rather sophomoric, and the plot is red-herring-ridden. OK, I'll admit I was surprised a couple of times, but only because of what I'd heard about Laymon's other books. I was only expecting surprises that turned out not to be there. Based on what I've heard from friends, I'll probably read other Laymon titles as they become available, but I can't recommend BITE, especially to a first-time Laymon reader. Like me. I know this genre well, and this novel could be used as an argument that the genre is simply, well, weak. And it's not. It's just that BITE *is*!"
3,An average read . . .,"I've read two of Laymond's books. He seems a bit preoccupied with sex, though this book didn't have as much of that in it as ""Night In the Lonesome October."" What I liked was the constant changing of the main villain and the fact that we are never really sure if the ""vampire"" is really undead or not. What I don't like is the fact that mortals are shown as enjoying bloodletting as a sexual release."
3,One of Laymon's average books,"compared to many of his other books, 'Bite' has a story line that is a little bit of a let down. the two main characters go through a grusome adventure, while trying to figure out whether the stiff they killed is a vampire or not. Richard laymon manages to keep the story interesting throughout including a chilling end which keeps you wondering what happened. But the weak story line and surprisingly strange main characters leaves you feeling left with an average satisfaction. this book is worth getting only if youve read all the laymon classics first."
3,Not Leckie's Finest Hour,"Since Leckie was one of the soldiers fighting for Guadalcanal, he quite quickly loses the objectivity that might have made this a better book. Unlike his other works where his style is plain and forthright, here one suspects him almost of tilting a bottle while he recalls the best and worst of Guadalcanal. Too often the book reads as if Leckie had written it overnight for his surviving comrades also stationed on the island; the endnotes are plagued with citations reading ""author's recollection."" Some of these personal reflections are obviously important to the historical fabric of Guadalcanal, but Leckie's style in this particular work seems to speak to a very finite specific audience rather than the general public. On the one hand I felt as if we were there during the conflict, and on the other I felt like a wastrel and misfit hoping the whole thing was over."
1,"Not a SLOW Cooker -TOO HOT, TOO FAST","This product should be in a category all by itself, FAST COOKER! It cooks too fast and burns your food. The exterior gets too hot and has the potential to cause burns to anybody that touches it. I've owned it now for over two years and have learned you cannot ""set it and forget it"". Don't think you can start it before you leave for work and come home to a delicious meal, you can't! It burns and overcooks everything. Please do yourself a favor and go buy a different brand; I'm fed up with this one and I'm buying a new one today!"
1,Defective,"I loved the size of this pot and the programming options. The first few times I tried it I didn't have a problem but it cooked faster than the recipe specified. Then I started noticing that food burned against the pot in one area whenever I used it. The last time I scrubbed the burned part, I noticed little cracks. (I bought it at Kohl's and they let me exchange it for different slow cooker.)"
2,Another Broken Handle,"The handle is a real issue! To extend the use, I've Gorilla glued the handle back on a couple of times ~ I didn't even think to call rival direct and I couldn't find a replacement handle anywhere. From other reviews, I agree that $18 is WAY to much. The handle just broke off again last night ~ definitely time for me to buy a new crock pot and it will not be a Rival."
1,It's too hot constructed badly,"I agree with all the other reviews regarding the heat issue-- always too hot! I had both the side handles break off(of my 4 year model) and this week the knob on the lid broke-- without that knob all the steam leaves, so no longer cooks effectively! The good news was I emailed customer service and they were quick to ship me out a new model free! I would have preferred a refund so I could get the Hamilton Beach unit ppl are raving about, but this is better than nothing!"
1,AN ARROGANT AND OVERAMBITIOUS ACCOUNT OF THE STOCK MARKET!,"from experience i am familiar with the subject of the book well, and it seems to me that the author attempts to overthrow logic in this work. A waste of money and time..."
1,Never know what you're going to get with Targus,"I have bought several CD/DVD cases from Targus. Some are great (like the discontinued bubble sleeve binders) and some are terrible (like the City Gear). This case has the absolute worst kind of sleeve. The ones with 1) slots that do not easily fit the CD booklets and 2) the slots with the most idiotic design ever invented: a plastic tab at the top that scratches CDs when put in or taken out of the slot. Targus makes many good products. This is NOT one of them. My suggestion is to avoid this product, unless you really like getting your CDs scratched and scuffed."
3,Could be better,"Finally I found a dvd case big enough for all my son's dvds, but, I think this product could be better because the dvds don't seem to stay put in the slots..."
3,So far so good,"Upon receiving I was pleased with the style and construction. This was a gift, so the durability is yet to be determined. I will be back..."
2,Don't buy this case if you're looking to fill it to capacity,"At first this seems like a great CD/DVD case: the materials used are first class, the pages are soft, zipper zips smoothly. The only flaw is in the design construction of the pages. They basically stapled a 4-CD sheet in the middle to fold in half like a book. This becomes a problem when you fill all the slots to capacity. It's now too tight to lay flat and there isn't enough slack in the middle to close nicely. You can force it closed but you shouldn't have to! If they're going to bind the sheets to the spine this way there should be more space in the middle by the binding to give it more slack. It's kind of hard to explain but I hope you can understand. I ended up just filling it to 65 discs instead of 80 so it would close nicely."
3,This was a gift.,"The recipient said, ""It was okay."" No enthusiasm or request to read anymore of Andrews. I did not read it myself."
4,Lowepro Slingshot 300,"I purchased the bag for an upcoming trip after looking on the Internet at backpacks from Tamrac, Think Tank Photo, Mountainsmith, NatGeo, Kata and Tenba. The compartments readily adjusted for my equipment. (DSLR, WA and Tele lens, flash, extra batteries, point & shoot, chargers & binocular) I've been walking around the neighborhood to get adjusted to the loaded sling and once I got the waist belt adjusted, it has been very comfortable. Carrying my equipment around in a shoulder bag becomes very tiring and I especially like being able to release the waist belt, reach across my body with my right hand and pull the sling in front of me. A quick unzip and out comes the camera, lenshood in position, ready to use and I don't have to look for a spot to set down my bag. From my limited experience so far, I would recommend this sling."
4,SlingShot 300 Overview,"Very convenient bag once you figure out it only fits on one side of your body. You can carry a lot of stuff and have access to it relatively easily, especially to the camera. If you just have a Digital SLR and a lens or two, this is probably too big. If you have more stuff to carry around, this is great."
1,All-Weather-Not if you don't recieve the rain cover that's supposed to be included,"This camera bag was sold to me by 6ave Camera. I sent 6ave an email and explained the situation and recieved no response. While I have not delt with them in the past, my experience has not been a good one. One of the main reasons I bought the bag is because of its all-weather capability. I often shoot in the mountains of Arizona, hiking miles from my vehicle and storms roll in quickly. I will not order from then again. J. Michael Tofaute"
5,Sweet bag great price,"I live in the Caribbean and take a lot of photos. I only have two lenses right now but I carry a ton of other things so this bag was perfect. When it came my only concern was it might be too big, but I have been using it for everything. I also love all of the little compartments and pockets. The only thing it is missing is a key ring clip."
5,A Great Read,"I just love Jeffrey Long. I don't usually read books of this genre, but Jeffrey Long draws you in...He really knows how to tell a story. I thought I wouldn't like this book because it might not be ""girly"" enough, but that wasn't the case at all. He tells a great tale both men and women can enjoy. His characters are interesting and his books are well researched..I'll definetly be reading more of his books!"
2,Annoying,"I looked for a copy of this movie for months. Finally found it and met with disappointment. Levels? Seriously? I seriously cringed during some of the narration with her talking about ""levels"" and ""getting to the next level"" and so it, modern online games DO NOT HAVE ""LEVELS"", please don't make a movie if your gaming experience ends at Super Mario Bros 3.No plot to speak of, or at the very least is slow, plodding, and boring. Why is she walking around at the start? Why? Where's she going?The absolute worst aspect of this movie is the freaking main character. SHE TALKS LIKE BARBARA WALTERS.Let this be a lesson to all would-be directors. You need a cohesive and COHERENT plot above all else, along with characters with solid acting ability that you can relate to. Even the cliche-stew that was Avatar at least had this."
2,"Nice music, some great footage, but amateurish editing","As a huge Chet Baker fan, it was great to see this footage of him, especially when he was younger. Also there was a lot of nice music. However, the film is disappointing in that it is very poorly organized, and many of the talking heads are not properly introduced or placed in context. Also, there is a kind of mean, condescending emphasis on Chet the deteriorated pretty boy. The overall feel of the film is overly negative, and disrespectful. Its rather slow at times, saved only by the lovely music."
3,BESR OF OLIVER SAIN,"MOST SINGLE ON THIS IS ALBUMSGOOD. I LOVE SOUL SERENADE IT,SMY FAVONITES I RECOMMEND IT HIGHLT."
1,cashew butter made with peanut oil?,"I specifically bought and spent the extra money for cashew butter because I am allergic to peanuts, only to find that it contails ""peanut"" oil! In the garbage it went."
3,Cashew Butter,It is a good healthy but for me it is so dry. I added honey mix. It is OK I still explore which better for me.
5,Very good for beginners to start out with a one mile walk.,"This walking exercise DVD is an excellent way to start out easy and then move on when the beginning walk because easy. I'm still on the beginners level because I haven't exercised in quite a while. My doctor recommended me to start walking for my heart, but it is still too cold to walk my neighborhood. This tape is better than walking your neighborhood or mall beccause Leslie Sansone incorporates helpful conditioning for otherr muscle groups.I would highly recommend this DVD for beginners. If you are further advanced, you could still use this DVD, since there is a second part that really revs up the walking and gets your heart rate up. She has other DVD's that also address more advanced walkers. I would recommend this this DVD to others."
2,Start Walking At Home,The quality of the dvd was poor and made it hard for me to see properly. I was really disappointed.
5,I love it.,It gives me a great workout! I haven't exercised a whole lot in the past and this is a great way to get started.
5,Best At-Home Walk DVD,"I got this exercise dvd for my birthday. My husband and I both love it, and it has become my most used gift. We do the 1-mile walk together several mornings each week. His legs and back used to hurt when we walked outside on the sidewalks but not when we follow these exercises on the carpet at home. Sometimes, I do the 2-mile walk alone because it is too advanced for him at this time. We are both in our mid-sixties and have some back problems (healed herniated disks). I also have osteoporosis and mild scoliosis. There is only one exercise on this dvd I would caution others with similar back problems about doing. At the end of each walk, Ms. Sansone does a lunge and tells you to stretch your back forward, and then to stretch a bit more until your back is straight. I tried it a couple of times and got back pain several hours later. Now, I do it without the extra stretch. In other words, I do not completely flatten out my back, and I've had no more pain."
5,Branden was quite the ladies' man,"Goodness, his ' years with Ayn Rand ' certainly included a great deal of boffing, didn't they ? Sleeping by turns with three women at once - and he was married to one of them !I shall have to look into this 'objectivism' philosophy ! It all sounds quite merry."
2,This saga needs less caffeinne,"The premises for this film are all extremely attractive. Immortals that reincarnate and live in an Olympus style mountain look over the mortals and battle a fallen brother, reminiscing Melkor/Morgoth against the other Valar in the Silmarillion. And sacrifice and wisdom can lead the heroes through sorrowful sacrifices to ultimate victory against the odds.But the director filmed in such an accelerated state that this movie jumps from an action scene to another without pause leading to extremely basic dialogues, paper thin characters and confusing reincarnations. Sometimes there are scenes of exquisite beauty showing strong cinematographic skills by the professionals involved. That saves the movie from a one star rating.This saga needed more footage, maybe even a series, to become a true epic worthy of remembering."
1,"not designed to, you know, function","This item was really disappointing. It looks nice enough, but is poorly made. The wicker isn't very nice, and the interior faux leather straps are shoddy.The worst part, by far, is that carrying it by the handle would cause all your unsecured items inside (i.e your food) to fall to the bottom in transit. Such careless design! I decided to return mine before using."
3,So So,Quality was alright but less that what was expected. The box itself is sufficient but the flatware and plates were not as elegant as I was hoping for.
3,Amazon needs to update this - on indefinate backorder,"I ordered this item and was never informed that it was on backorder indefinately until my other item of furniture came from Spinkeeper. No email response from Spinkeeper, but Amazon did email me saying the item was on backorder. You all need to change the ""Ships in 1-2 business days"" on here."
4,"a fun, imaginative book","My son received this as a gift and adores it. While we don't read it every day anymore, it is still a favorite. I'd recommend this book for the 2-4 age range. The book goes through silly scenarios starting with chimps and going on to all kinds of different animals in other silly situations. The illustrations are excellent!"
2,basic information - nothing more,"This is another in a long line of instuctional books written by a pro athlete who doesn't really have the ability to pass his methods along to neophytes. Athletes who are blessed with God given talent and have the abilility to flat-out ""Do it"" seldom have worthwhile information to pass along to those less fortunate. I have read many baseball coaching books and I found this one to be typical of those written by naturally gifted pros. There is little in this book that could be considered authoritative and definitive in terms of improving the hitting prowess of the young baseball player. Better to stick to books authored by experienced coaches, particularly the college variety. They have made careers of instructing players and their abilities show in their books. You want baseball instruction? Try Rob Delmonico"
3,Tony Gwynn: The Art of Hitting,This is a so-so hitting book. Doesn't provide any science on how to swing a bat. Just talks about hitting off the tee and how good he was as a hitter. He doesn't talk about the hitting sequence and what should be where during different parts of the swing.
1,"""Oh God, Oh God Where should I go""","Well back to traveling maybe. This was as lame as a book can be. Its amazing you have to read it all because its so awful & how could such junk could get published. Marie Claire or ""such sweet prey"" as the killer stated was sycharine & sickening"" Save yourself & weather the storm or just go out & buy an umbrella.Insomnia fodder."
5,New to me,"I have owned most Concrete Blonde albums, but just never got around to buying this one until now. Kinda glad i waited all these years because it's great to have ""new"" CB to listen to. This band never disappoints. The production, writing and musicianship are all first rate. Can't say enough good about this album or the band."
5,a must read for the bride to be,"I'm planning a wedding and am totally stressed out. This helped me and gave me a few laughs, which is the most important part. It's a great engagement gift for anyone looking for an overview and some perspective on the whole wedding business."
3,Good quality chrome,This tow hook is very heavy duty and appears to be good quality chome . Would have prefered the hook in 304 stainless but no one seems to make it probably because of the cost.
5,Perpetual War for Perpetual Peace by Gore Vidal,"This master of the essay leaves you wanting more - more to read, more to provoke thought, more to share with friends. This book is a remarkable find, enlightening the reader about Timothy McViegh, September 11, the state of our union."
4,The Irony behind war and peace,"Gore Vidal makes interesting points involving the irony between war and peace. In his collection of essay's Mr.Vidal investigates the Oklahoma City Bombing and September 11. Mr.Vidal presents facts that the main stream media has not covered. This book gives the public information that the government has tried to manipulate. Gore Vidal looks beyond the acts of ""evil-doers"" and relates the United States belief of ""Perpetual War For Perpetual Peace"", as the motives behind September 11th and the Oklahoma City Bomning. Gore Vidal touches on the effects of September 11th and the Oklahoma City Bomoing and how it relates to the Bill of Rights. This book is an eye opener and will motivate you to become more informed in the role of the United States"
2,Necessary yet unpolished,"While Gore Vidal asks essential questions and makes some key points that are welcome in these days of reductionist thinking, this book left me with the feeling that it was unpolished, rapidly thrown together with bits and pieces lying around (including an incomplete list of war statistics filling page after page, almost unformatted).Gore Vidal is not writing from a basement on a typewriter by the light of a candel. Yet, this collection of essays gives this impression. And this does the general argument he makes a disfavor."
2,Superficial and self-promoting,"Gore Vidal's opus is subtitled ""How We Got to be so Hated"". The cover promises ""penetrating and alarming essays."" Would that he had make more than a token attempt to seriously discuss that much needed subject. Unfortunately, the bulk of the book is devoted to a wandering and repetitious discussion of Timothy McVeigh's motives for the Oklahoma City bombing.The book should have been written in 1998 or so; Vidal is out of touch with the new abridgements of American freedoms that have occurred since 9/11/01.In general this was an attempt to pack fifteen page magazine argticle into a 160 page book."
1,nope,I applied it to my glasses as the instructions said word for word and it does not work.~!@#$%^&*() So If you are looking for something to eliminate fog this might not be a good choice.
5,and they say a white boy can't play the blues!,Gotta echo the other reviewers sentiments on this one...worth the price of admission for the multiple renditions of Hoochie Coochir Man alone...not to mention a hilarious Howard Kaylon!!! We are waiting....
1,Socked in the Eye,"I can't believe what I paid for this .... For starters, the graphics were horrible, the so-called textures and fabrics even worse. Just maneuvering in this thing was a vertigo-ridden nightmare. You'd think a bunch of pre-kindergarteners conspired and put this thing together. On second thought, I think they'd have done a lot better. Then again, the brand name says it all--if you buy this thing you're surely gonna take a PUNCH!"
1,Try something else,"This program isn't too bad for drawing floor plans - as long as it stays running without crashing long enough to get something done. This program crashed a lot on my computer (500mhz athlon w/ 256MB memory and Win 98se) The color chip selection is a joke with only a couple dozen colors. Stairways have to be made in their funiture creation tool (a nightmare). I didn't waist any time replacing this program with something else. Get a program that you can specify RGB colors for walls, a real staircase tool, and doesn't crash every 10 minutes."
4,"Beautiful pictures, good recipes",Some very creative recipes for cooking vegetables. The photos are lovely; my veggies never look that great.
3,"Bad artwork, nice music.","Uriah Heep ""Innocent Victim"" DNC (1977).Their 11th studio album. ""Innocent Victim"", was just held back by a terrible album cover, nobody took it seriously. This album has some pretty good rockers in, ""Free 'N"" Easy"", with some good guitar by Mick Box. The mid-tempo ""Roller"" and the progressive /reggae ""The Dance"". 1978 brought us ""Fallen Angel""."
3,"This Should Be A Bret Michaels Album, Not Poison!","This cd is not Poison! Poison mean:Bret Michaels On lead Vocals, C.C. Deville On lead guitar, Bobby Dall On Bass, & Rikki Rockett On drums! This cd does not include C.C. & it shows! Nobody can rip them chords like C.C.! This cd has great drums & great vocals but the guitar just does not compare to C.C! You want a real Poison CD Buy Any other poison cd! Not This One!"
5,Pleased,"The smell of most beauty products cause my sinuses to swell like an emergency raft. No such problem with this toner. I have combination skin that tends to be dryer in the winter, and it doesn't help that Texas is so windy and dusty. This is the first toner I have ever used, but it seems to be everything I could want in a toner. My lotion is finally penetrating my skin instead of floating on top or drying up, the ingredients aren't toxic and the price is right. I also recently began using Earth Science'a a-d-e cleanser on my face instead of Dr Bronner's miracle soap, and that is also helping me combat my mild winter dryness. I still use Dr. Bronner's as my 'everything else' soap. Seriously check that stuff out."
1,not happy,Stopped my glucos for this H.A. Crap. My joints are getting worse after being on it for two weeks. This sucks.
4,Easily Understood Christology from a Theologian Pope,"This book expands on the Christology that the current Pope teaches. There are indicators of the Bonaventure-based theology of Christ here, the very topic on which His Holiness wrote his Doctoral dissertation. Ratzinger writes as he teaches- methodically and evenly paced, luring the reader into a deeper understanding of the study and pursuit of Jesus Christ. The reader will come away with a more profound appreciation of all thing Catholic, taught in a way this ""theologian pope"" can. If you can only read 3 pages, the introduction- hard hitting and in the face of relativism sums up his intent."
4,Dred Pelvis,"Despite the vocal shortcomings of a B-list Elvis impressionist, Un-Led-Ed is actually not half bad. Good instrumentalists (especially the guitarist, who covers Page with real gusto) and the sheer nerve of their concept help to make this over the top cd a memorable one."
5,Awesome,"I was given a pair of these Acer AL2416W monitors to use on a dual headed workstation at work. I have been using them for several hours per day for about a week now and I am very impressed. I am using the highest resolution (1900x1200). Colors are vivid, text is razor sharp, and movies display nicely with the widescreen format. And, they are very reasonably priced. Thumbs up!"
3,Swimming in paranoia.,"A surreal film about one man's descent into shock, paranoia and despair. Burt Lancaster is riveting in his portrayal of a wealthy executive who cannot (or will not) face the facts of his family's disintegration. Lancaster's image as a macho guy is turned upside down in this film, as we see him in a vulnerable, almost pathetic state by the film's end. Clad only in swimtrunks (or less) for the entire film, his character is metaphorically naked, defenseless against an onslaught of jaded ex-lovers, uncaring acquaintances, and hostile enemies. An odd, arty film, outside the main of Lancaster's other work but well worth viewing for his excellent acting and the powerful message of the film."
1,KEEP THESE BOOKS IN PRINT,"If he just kept these books in print then everyone could ""enjoy"" his work, but instead anythig with the Mark Ryden name is quickly grabbed up and hocked on eBay at ridiculously inflated prices. And ENOUGH with the creepy little girl paintings already. Is this something Mr. Ryden picked up when he did the album artwork for Michael Jackson ""Dangerous""? So overrated, total HYPE. Like (some of) the art; hate the BS hype machine he drives."
4,"Nice Book, But Don't Go Broke On It","Anima Mundi offers a nice sampling of Mark Ryden's work up to (but not including) his Bunnies and Bees exhibition artwork which is his best work so far. Some of his nice tiki themed images aren't here, and there's a number of commercial illustrations that I didn't care for. But overall a nice selection. It's his only retrospective book collection so it's your only choice right now. Although a quick seller, the book is being revised and improved for its second printing so don't spend too much cash on a 1st printing is you have to have one now, the 2nd printing will be the better buy when it comes out. Honestly, the cover price on this was $[money] and amazon's price was $[money]. So to pay $[money] plus some people are asking for is crazy!"
4,Dress up a 10/22 a little...,"The recoil from a 10/22 isn't going to hurt anyone no matter how many rounds you fire. I got this because it adds an extra 1.5"" to the length of pull on this tiny little gun, and it serves that purpose very well. It screwed in as a direct replacement for the metal butt-piece, and matches up fairly close to the stock. There are some edges and bumps where it doesn't fit all that well, but that doesn't affect function. A useful piece if you are a tall person who likes to plink and doesn't want to buy a custom stock."
3,"Welcome back, Mase","After 5 years away from the rap game, Mase makes a big comeback with the first single off his new album, ""Welcome Back."" Mase isn't the same rapper he was when he left though, as you may already know, Mase found religion, and he's a clean man now. It shows in this song too, he doesn't cuss at all, which makes for an overall good vibe in this one. The song heavily samples the ""Welcome Back Kotter"" song, which has been done many times before, but for the first time here, it's done well. Mase seems to borrow his flow from P. Diddy here, which can be a good or bad thing, depending on how you feel about P. Diddy. This song itself gets a little old after a while though, but it doesn't get annoying. So is Mase welcome back? I would say the answer is yes."
4,Great Fan,"I have been using this fan with a thermostat for two years in a residential meter room that is enclosed. My breakers had been tripping due to thermal shutdown. I had an electrician look at my panels in this room and wanted to charge me over $10,000.00 to redo the electrical panels (all four).So I bought this and it solved the issue! Easy to install, mine came with the lag bolts, and hooking it up to the thermostat was no big deal.Matter of fact I bought another one and stuck it in my garage which has an a/c unit. I run it in the fall / spring when the humidity is not too bad.Great unit and no it is not an oscillating fan; but it is so powerful the air flow / output is tremendous."
2,dont run on high speed,Its a good fan at med to low speed. Easy to install as well.. but on high speed it has quite a bit of vibration.
2,Rough mixed with smooth,Some of the examples in the book are useful but for a book in the Unleashed series it's just not up there with the quality I have come to expect. For example the first two chapters working with arrays and controlling program flow I would expect to find in a beginners book If..Then..Else just isn't material for an advanced level book. The chapters on OOP left me cold in fact possibly more confused than when I started reading them. However the stuff on Programming with controls wasnt too bad. I haven't braved the last couple of sections yet. I do like the reference section in that I find it easier to scan for function names than the online help provided with VB5. However even this is flawed in that the entire list of properties is provided even though you can just right click the control to get them.
1,Just don't,"This dvd player is simply terrible. The picture is choppy, the remote stops working after a couple weeks and then a month down the road the player is toast. Spend a little extra cash and find a player that will last you, if you like blowing money you can always just send some my way."
5,excelent,I thought this book excelent. The photos and the details given on how they were made were very informative.
5,a wonderful book for all students of Yungian Psychology,Aristotle said the definition of man is the definition of his soul.So everybody who wants to know psychology is necessary to read this book !
4,Useful for Family Devotions with Little Ones,"Hi,I am a home educating mum of two. A boy, 4 and a girl,3. We have been using this as part of our morning devotions. I photocopied the pictures and have been giving them to the wee ones to colour in while I get ready and then they bring them through for devotions time. When we are done, we can put them up on the wall to remind us of the story. I think it's a great resource as a change to a children's bible but because we only use a page a day and not all the stories are directly from the Word, I think it's a good supplementary devotional. We use other children's bibles as our primary material. All in all, I'm really pleased I bought this and we'll probably use it over and over as we re-cover the valuable character lessons. They are good for parents too!!"
5,Great Book!,Excellent book. I use it with my 5 1/2 and 3 1/2 year old girls. We use it during devotions and they love it. The concepts are easily understood. I recommend this book to parents or teachers.
5,Proof,"This book is extremely informative- it is chock full of facts, scientific experiements and, well- Proof. It did take me a little while to get through this book because of that. But, Lynne McTaggart does not talk down to the reader or make the subject light and fluffy. Because of that, I really enjoyed it and actually learned a lot. Because of all the facts and proof, I would recommend getting this book for someone who is skeptical or on the fence about the power of intention. Again, Ms. McTaggart presents the material in a very factual manner, she does not litter her pages with ""feelings""- for lack of a better term."
4,The Intention Experiment by Lynne McTaggert,"I found several good nuggets in this book that helped me along my path! It was the next step in my ""journey""."
1,Shoddy replacement.,"Bought the spare adapter back in August. It's January, the cord is already frayed. Substituted the frayed portion of the cord with my original one & now the adapter itself fried. No good. Came back to check if it had a year warranty (as most parts do) and no luck. I'll be buying a genuine HP replacement."
5,Let's all tell the truth,"If we all faced the truth about where animal products came from, would we still make the same choices? This book puts forth more than the truth about food. It puts forth the truth about capitalism."
4,Vegans rock and this book makes you proud of it.,"This book is really awesome, especially for a person who is interested in becoming a vegan. If everyone read this book they would think twice about what they stick in their mouths. Animal liberation!!!! Eight billion are killed every year in the U.S. E-mail me fellow vegans!!"
5,Poignant tales,"""After Many Days"" is one of my favourite thematic volumes of LMM's short stories. These stories deal with people who set things ""right"" after years of misunderstanding or absence. ""In the Old Valley"" and ""Between the Hill and the Valley"", both stories of love which survives time and separation, are among my favourite LMM stories out of any collection. There are no surprises in this book - if you are familiar with LMM's work you will find more of the same here. This collection stands out from the others for its honest poignancy, which strikes me anew every time I read it."
5,Another Gem From ITC,"Department S is another gem from ITC Entertainment that has essentially been forgotten. Marty Berman who produced the Saint and Dennis Spooner (associated with the Avengers and Dr. Who) created a series that was exciting, with creative storylines and believable characters. Each episode is like watching a ""mini"" spy movie. The production, although on a very tight budget (some of the fight scenes have music borrowed from the Saint), rarely display that fact. The minute you hear the theme song writen by Edwin Astley, you instantly know you are in for a treat. If you like Brittish television and top notch series like The Avengers, The Saint, Callum, etc., you will want Department S in your collection."
2,Why not Widescreen?,"I simply cannot recommend this DVD because of the full screen, pan-and-scan format; too much is lost. The special FX & gothic look could really be great if only the DVD was offered in letterbox format. Wait for a widescreen version... then buy it!"
2,Not really worth watching,"Unless you're super desperate to watch something you haven't seen, don't watch this. It is not very good. I was desperate, but I wish I would have found something better to watch."
4,Nothing like the old school,"Now there are some old school movies, and there are some ""Old School Movies!"" This is one of the latter, and a must have for the consummate movie buff."
4,Not too bad,There is only one reason why this movie is ignored. The Shadow is not as recognized like other comic book characters like Batman or Spawn. The action is fun and so is the storyline. Just make sure the character is well known before putting too much into it and wanting to make it a hit.
3,Shadow,Great old movie enjoyed it a blast from the past Alex was good cinematography was so 90's but oh well
5,The Shadow,"If you like this type of movie, then you'll love this one. Not the typical super hero movie, but The Shadow isn't your typical hero type."
3,Fun Movie But Universal Ruined The DVD,"Before a quick summation of the story, one warning: a big one for those into good visuals (as I am). Universal Studios committed the unbelievable ""sin"" of photographing this is 2.35:1 widescreen but only offering it on DVD in formatted-to-TV, so you miss 40 percent of the great visuals. Not only that, they zoom the picture to fill the screen so it isn't sharp, either. I hope this situation is rectified. It's a disgrace.As for the story, it is a very, very hokey no-brained-but very entertaining fantasy/adventure, based on the popular radio hero of the 1930s.This is just pure escapism, not to be judged seriously because it's a dumb story. It's cartoon-like, an outlandish story that mixes action, comedy and a superhero with time-travel and all sorts of strange happenings. For someone who likes to gawk at the sights and sounds of the `30s and `40s, this is a fun film. Just be warned that you're not seeing all that is to be seen!"
4,The Shadow,I am still waiting for the product to arrive in Australia as yet.I bought this from Amazon because a company that i purcahse my DVD's from could not get a copy.They recommended i try Amazon.I am concerned that the postage is by sea mail and not air.Four to eight weeks delivery is a long time.Regards Silverback.
2,"What, no widescreen?",OK movie; love it.No widescreen? Have they forgotten that it is well into the 21st century?Lavish use of color and time setting; and no widescreen?Should I close one eye next museum trip? Plug an ear the next symphony I go to?No widescreen = fail.Not going to purchase until a widescreen ( i.e. PROPER ) format is available.
3,"Not bad, but should have had an editor","There are so few resources available on the porphyrias that every book is a valuable gift. However, it's unfortunate that this one apparently wasn't edited by a professional, as it would have improved the readability considerably.Still, it's probably the best place to start for those with porphyria and their families."
2,Tooooo many story lines,"I love Diana Palmer but this book had way too many story lines competing for attention. She should have made this book into a three book trilogy and more fully developed the brother and sister characters. As it is, they just muddle up the story and make it longer than it should be."
4,new horizens,"infectious rhythms, tight band... if you like mellow jazz, flute and vibes this is killer.. catchy tunes, percussion is great, super bass, steve kahn always tasty on guitar.. have to disagree with the other review that only gave this one star...HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
1,More than meets the eye,"The book over simplifies the issue. Behavioral inteventions are a MUST in treating any ADHD/ADD. It must be diagnoised by a physician with the anticdotal observations of parents and teachers, school counselors, etc. This is a real behavioral issue involving real brain chemistry differences. My advise to parents-being a parent of an ADHD child and a counselor is to use both behavioral interventions and medication--at least try the meds for 6 weeks along with using a schedule, more structure, etc."
1,Another Sensationalist Book from the Flat Earth Folks,"I don't want to sound like an alarmist, but this book, and many of its ilk, that claim that ADHD is over-diagnosed (it's not) and that medications are extraordinarily dangerous (they are not) misleads way too many people into not exploring appropriate treatments for their children. There is a persuasive group of ""flat earth"" people who still believe that ADHD is not real, that it is an invention of Psychiatry, and that medications are not a reasonable treatment. When they get others to read these kind of books, they do a great disservice to a scientific perspective and the children who count on parents and adults to make fully informed, 21st century decisions.If you must buy this book, do your children the favor of buying another book that gives a balanced, scientifically proven perspective. Don't just be sucked in by the rhetoric of anti-psychiatry fanatics."
3,Water Quality Assurance,This discontinued product was the best available alternative at the time we installed it. Our missing owner's manual might have reminded us that a RED light after replacing filter means this unit's batteries need replacing. Relieving water pressure with plunger avoids filter replacement hassles described by prior reviewer.
5,Roy Toy Logs - Made in USA,"I gave this to my grandson for Christmas. He loves it, and my daughter tells me he has played with it almost every day since then. He also received a set of Lincoln Logs (made in China), which his mother returned and will replace with an additional set of these logs. The logs are squared off instead of round like Lincoln Logs, otherwise are very similiar. A very good basic building toy, made in Maine!"
1,Laugh out loud!,"I borrowed this movie from my friends that rented it because they said ""I just had to see it! It was the most hilarious thing they've seen."" And I agree! It was hilarious because it was sooo STUPID! Geez, where is horror going these days?! Was the director trying something new with the whole black light effect and the weird moving demons??!! This movie had a lot of funny lines and the goth girl was an excellent actress, she would be hilarious in a comedy, why she picked this stupid movie to be in I have no idea?! RENT, don't BUY this movie. You have to see it to believe how stupid it is!! P.S. The very beginning is pretty graphic for those of us who actually look up to religion."
4,Slow but Sweet Understated Comedy,"Repeat-offender Jimmy (James Nesbitt) finds himself doing time after a botched bank job. When the prison warden (Christopher Plummer), an aspiring playwright, proposes that the prison put on a production of his musical, Jimmy and his fellow inmates plan to use the performance as a diversion while they make a get away. Things get complicated, however, when Jimmy falls for the prison's psychologist, Annabel (Olivia Williams). This entertaining black comedy carries some good acting and a marvelously understated sense of humor. The warden's musical, based on the swashbuckling life of Viscount Horatio Nelson, is about as lavish as an elementary school production, and wonderfully dreadful to boot. Although a bit slow at times, patient viewers will find themselves rewarded."
4,"Who loves you, Baby?","I'm not a Custer or Army or western Americana buff, but as many others have, I have been fascinated by this episode. What I found in Sandoz's book, moreso than in others, is that my visual cortex seemed to be working better, based on the vivid descriptions. I was able to picture the layout and scenery better than before, the visual imagery. That said, Sandoz does have a somewhat peculiar style of writing, in this work. Possibly, as someone else noted herein, it was ghost written based on her notes. Anyway, reading this book will chill anyone who can identify with the losing side, what it must really be like to stare death in the face, before actually dying. Diximus."
3,"Some essential tracks, and then some filler...","This seems to be out of print now, but is worth picking up if you can find a good price on a used one. Several of the songs by the more well-known artists are available on other compilations. (The songs by Squeeze, Timbuk 3, and Wall of Voodoo can all be found on ""Just Can't Get Enough: New Wave Christmas"".) The dB's ""Home For the Holidays"" is hard to find anywhere else.For the record, I get a kick out of Dread Zeppelin's Elvis-meets-reggae-meets-Zeppelin-meets-Spike-Jones-with-a-touch-of-Zappa ""...My Two Front Teeth"", but most people I've played it for find it annoying.Also for the record, Klark Kent is actually Stewart Copeland of the Police."
5,"what a treat, mixture of story and wonderful food",I was in Vermont. I could smell the smells and see the land. I could taste each recipe. This is now my favorite cooking tool. I cook and my family reads from the book. Thank you for this wonderful treasure. I will visit!
5,I am a fan,"I am reading all of Havill's books in this series and loving all of them.So far, I have read 10 of them."
5,great seller,"The book came as promised in very good condition and in a timely fashion. I couldn't be happier-except for the fact that i have to read it now, but that's besides the point. I would order from here again."
5,Riverdance,I bought this as a present for my sister. She loves the Celtic dancing. She loved the music and dancing!
5,"Duh, it's RIVERDANCE!",Yay! They're coming here next summer! Won't miss it for the world!GET ALL THE VIDEOS! :)Major Riverdance fan...BTC END
5,Filling the Generation Gap,"Amazed and spell bound is what we were-3 generations,60's,30's,teens and toddlers, men, women, boys and girls watching, foot stomping and toe tapping to the staccato rythms of the Irish and Flemenco dances and then soothed by the haunting and plaintive melodies of the Anuna singers and Davy Spillane's peculiar instrument (what is that called?). An excellent multi-generation show! The dancing in particular, sparked an inter-generational conversation of the history of dance in the USA. My 60+ ankles and knees ached just watching this show, but for good ""craic"" (Irish meaning chat, good talking, good time, fun) for all generations, 'tis an amazing, and spell binding multi-generational experience. Try not to watch this alone. You'll want to talk about it."
3,MTV style Editing/filming,"Was recently looking for Michael Flattley DVDs and ran across the reviews for this edition of Riverdance. Apparently those who handed out the 5 stars never actually attended any sort of dance show. When the camera stayed focused on a dancer(s) for over two seconds the Director went nuts and immediately moved on. I actually like watching dancing, not the bloody camera flying all over the place, or focusing on Mr Flattley's face. To a degree I enjoyed the performance, when not out of my mind irritated over not being able to concentrate on that performance."
4,Riverdance not river music,It was an excellent movie full of and riverdance. It is called riverdance not river music. I understand that they have to rest but that is the choice they made when they started. Otherwise the dancing was great. I always fast forward through singing. But it was great other then that.
5,Live Concert From Ireland - This Is The One,"This live concert from the Point Theatre in Dublin, Ireland is terrific. The VHS has excellent sound and excellent video. There is great tap dancing with terrific audio. The show is breathtaking, thrilling and visually stunning. The speed and co-ordination of the dancing is wonderful. The show includes:1. Reel Around The Sun2. The Heart's Cry3. The Countess Cathleen4. Caoineadh Cu Chulainn - Davy Spillane5. Distant Thunder6. Firedance7. Riverdance8. Lift The Wings9. Freedom10. The Russian Dervish11. Heartland12. Riverdance InternationalThis show is starring Michael Flatley, Jean Butler and Maria Pages. It is 71 minutes in length.Live Concert (Memorial 336/6)"
5,Great Grill,Received my grill originally and the package was so damaged I refused shipment. After contacting customer service I am pleased to say they handled the problem without delay. A new grill was shipped to me and arrived without a problem. Thanks customer service you were great. As far as the grill it is a great product. I was skeptical of using natural gas because it sometimes fails to get hot enough. Not the case with this Weber. The temperature reached optimum cooking temp quickly and was easy to control and maintain. Thanks Weber for making a great product.
3,NG Grill,Fairly happy with my new grill. Some of the screws were not correct and the instructions didn't fully match the design and screws but was sufficient enough to properly (90%)assemble. It's gets nice and hot quickly. I wish they would go back to offering the flip up surface area extensions.
1,Terminally damaged in transit,"I took time off from work to take delivery of the grill and I enthusiastically prepared to put together my new grill only to discover that it had been badly damaged in transit and could not even be put together. What a dissapointment! They should really do a better job packing items that need to be transported and delivered by courier services such as UPS, as the carriers do not treat them with enough care."
2,Don't understand why the last three chapters was removed.,"I had a hard time finding the original version with the last three chapters intact even I am willing to pay more. It seems to be a great book based on reviews I read in various places, otherwise there will not be 20 buyers waiting in the queue for the used version."
4,How to Trade in Stocks- Still valid after 60 years.,"How to Trade in Stocks- is as relevent now as the principles were 60 years ago. This is a working manual on how the machinery of monitoring and understanding market trends. It was recommended to me by a Trader who said this was "" The Bible"" and is not generally a ""light read"". The book delves into the psycholgy of human behaviour and the true driving force behind a stocks performance."
3,Original Livermore Content is Fabulous. Smitten's is Trash,"I'm not sure whether this book deserves 1 star or 5. I read the thing several times and learned a lot from it. The first few chapters (50 or so pages) are the original text from Livermore's book of 1940. The rest is an astonishingly poorly written, edited and organized 'summary' and 'expansion' of the original text.The first 50 pages are a must-read. The rest is an irritating dog's breakfast from someone who does not appear to be terribly familiar with the stock market and trading."
2,An infomercial,"As others have said, the parts of the book written by Jesse Livermore are very worthwhile. However, at least half the book is a mish-mash of Livermore and Richard Smitten, and it's not always clear who is speaking. Smitten essentially repeats everything that Livermore already said and does a terrible job of it. Moreover, his attempt at taking control off the narrative is to bring up the biography he wrote on Livermore and the software based on Livermore's strategy. I can't believe I paid money for an infomercial. It seems like there are other books on Livermore that are more worthwhile."
1,"Horribly written with invalid, overly-simple sample questions","I have not yet taken the MTEL test, but after comparing the quality of the information in this book to actual MTEL General Curriculum test questions, I want my money back. There are typos on almost every page, and the information given is vague at best. I'm not sure this book was edited, and there is no way it was fact-checked. I'm sure the author(s) are nice people, but Amazon would be wise to remove this book from its catalogue; it's that bad."
4,Charlie Rich,"I never really heard much Charlie Rich growing up. However, there were two songs of his, ""Behind Closed Doors"" and ""The Most Beautiful Girl"" that I knew about and truly enjoyed. These songs were the reason I bought the CD. Turns out, there are other good songs on here, too!!"
4,"Beautiful and effective movie on Tibetan wildlife, its protectors and the poachers","Beautiful if grim view of men relation to wildlife in Tibet and China. Kekexili has a very effective aesthetics, devoid of slow motion and other overused special effects."
2,The Battle at Falaise,"Just average, nothing special. Most of the footage does not match the time or place. The narrative is very ordinary. Overpirced for the quality, but some very good footage of German AFV."
2,The Ballad of Little of Anything,"Digging through Hemphill's rambling Faulknerian sentences, disfigured O'Connor-like characters, and sensationalized tabloid-type facts, I couldn't find a plot. And I knew what was going to happen. Mr. Hemphill obviously found so much gossip he couldn't stand to leave any of it out, making for a long and winding trip up and down and around and through Highway 59.And while many of his facts were correct, many were terribly skewed: I suppose making for a more salacios tale. Read at your own risk of falling to sleep."
2,Would be good if it held up better.,"The concept behind this litter scoop is great. Unfortunately, it's not built to last. The container for the scoop is well designed and makes it easy to dump out any litter that may have held on to the scoop. The problem is the scoop itself is flexing where the handle meets the shovel after only 2 months of use."
3,difficult to remove label,"The hideaway scoop functions well enough. No complaints there. But I also bought it for the color and the finish, which I thought would make kitty's corner look neater and cleaner. However, the label on the front of the holder and the label adhesive just won't come off completely. So the product failed to deliver the neat and clean effect that I was hoping for. Instead dust, dirt, litter and hair stick to the residual adhesive on the surface, so it looks dirty all of the time. I am disappointed. The manufacturer should use a different type of label, perhaps just a wraparound paper label with the ends glued together but not glued to the product itself."
2,a little clumsy,"I had a problem with this scoop right out of the box... the label wouldn't come off. The purpose of buying the scoop with the case was so it would look sort of pretty in my bathroom. But then when I tried to peel off the label, it left a sticky mess. I tried scrubbing it off with hot soapy water, to no avail. Now I have dirt and cat hair getting stuck to the glue. Very disappointing.Also, getting it out of the case is a little clumsy. It doesn't stay open either, so you have to use your hands to open it back up, which defeats the purpose. The only nice thing about this scoop is the color."
2,Nice Concept While It Lasted,The scooper itself is very flimsy and scooping litter became even more of a hassle than it already is. Back to the pet store to buy a more durable scooper!
4,Keeps the cat area clean,"The little holder is genius. Sadly we used to put the scooper under the sink, which always grossed me out. Now the kitty litter is contained and the scooper is not spreading gross germs. The plastic is thinner than I hoped and a little flimsy. (If you need to scrap the bottom of the litter box, it is a little on the weak side) The scooper also just fits inside the holder, which makes for a tight fit. That said, I would buy this again, and likely will. It does what it was designed to, and keeps the kitty litter more contained."
2,"Scoop was great- the container, not so much...","Unlike other reviews, I haven't had any problems with the scoop itself. My problem is with the flimsy container. I have to carefully extract the scoop- like I'm playingHasbro Operation, or the flappy thing just falls right forward onto the ground. I don't know about you, but when I'm cleaning up my cat's crap, I kind of want the process to be over and done with and don't want to have to play tug of war with a container that will: a) fall apart, b) won't open, or c) just slide towards you (and THEN fall apart).I threw out the container and now just store the scoop (again, which I really like!) atop the litter box itself and call it a day. And since I do like half of the product- my official review is 2.5 stars. I rounded down."
1,What idiot ruined a good thing?,"I first bought a Booda hideaway scoop on Amazon about four years ago. It was a well designed, sturdy scoop with a attractive cover. After an international move, I decided last month to buy a new copy of the same model. This is NOT the same product! As others have mentioned, there are three big problems. First, and least significantly, the stickers on the cover are almost impossible to remove. Second, the entire construction is very flimsy and bends under the stress of a large clump. Third, and most grievously, the scalloped edge makes the easy task of cleaning a box with clumping litter into a nightmare. It cannot clean against the edges (especially the rounded edges of a Booda dome.) It rips well-formed clumps to shreds, making a sticky and seriously gross mess.Don't trust this item's overall high rating or the older favorable reviews. This is, as another recent purchaser reviewed, the world's worst litter scoop."
3,Complete Dialogue Please,"I've enjoyed this movie for years, seeing it in various incarnations, either on television (cut and edited depending on society's mores at the time) and also on video (where it was released years ago). The seven stories are entertaining and some do really touch you. However, I did noticed that some of the original dialogue has been cut, particularly during the Eve segment. I guess when they re-released this on DVD, the studio felt that the audience of 2008 couldn't handle Eve using the ""B word"" over the telephone to her fashion rival or telling her husband that she doesn't go to be with frightened yellow chickens. True, in the scheme of the universe, the cutting of a word here or there is inconsiquential, but when one has seen this film so many times, its kind of like hitting a speed bump."
3,Final Destination 3-D,"This movie was better than Final Destination 3. The 3-D was really cool. It made me jump and gasp when the first item flew out of the screen at me. I didn't make it through the whole movie in 3-D, as it was too hard for my eyes to adjust to the glasses, but then completed my viewing on the 2-D side. It is a good addition to fans of the final destination series."
4,The Best Is The Final!!,3d was not all that. But overall was good. The character George was funny! This movie had me wondering who was going to die first and last. I thought after all the other Destination's someone would live until they died of natural causes. Was i wrong. Like i said this is the best Final Destination. Worth buying on dvd.
1,STUUUUPID!!,"I thought this movie was pretty dumb. ""Death goes in patterns.""Puh-lease! I highly reccomend you don't even rent it if you have not seen it...it sucks big time! DO NOT watch it or you will waste an hour and a half of your life away...trust me, this is bad!"
3,Predictable but good,The 4th out of the Final Destination is much the same as the others but with the 3 D feature it stands out.
5,Astonishing,"Fans of horror movies can't miss this one.Without any big Hollywood star, no big budget, the story is told with rythm, involving you.I'm a big fan of it."
2,very poor acting!! little creativity!!,"This is hands down the worst installment of the Final Destination fanchise,, horrible actors,, the crazy deaths were not as impressive as the earlier parts... not even the 3D effects were outstanding and i have seen quite a few 3D movies,, i regret this purchase"
1,"save your money, save your time","In fact, slit your wrists and try to drown yourself on your own blood before fate ""snares you in"" and there is ""no escape"" and ""your time has come"" and you actually sit down to watch this load of nonsense. Go get Rosemary's Baby instead and remember how horror movies can be low-key AND exciting, instead of just low-key. Pros are an interesting death with a series of hilariously unfortunate ""mishaps"" and a candyman cameo... Everything else in this movie is a turd falling into my drink... Avoid it..."
1,Not quite what I wanted,"When purchasing a ""manual"" for anything the first thing that you expect is a explode drawing of parts and where the belong. I originally purchased this manual to see how to remove the fascia and chrome for a Road King so that I can fix the steering dampener grommets. The book does not even mention it. Steering dampener is a part that you have to replace after 20K miles, so you would think... No I guess not. The pictures are dark, looking as if the pages were copied not printed, the wording is not clear and the book is way too expensive for what you get. I purchased a Harley frame manual and a service manual and spent almost the same amount for two used books. So far I am not impressed with Haynes manuals and would not suggest purchasing one unless you can see it first."
4,Surprise ending,"The reading of the diary was interesting but the ending was a powerful one, brought me to tears. I am ready to read her next book."
3,more info less story,This book is OK. It has information that you must glean from his stories about his past experiences which includ gluing rods back together and such. The information on the terrain and stream types is excellent. The comments about patience and reading the surroundings are great. It is more like a story for readers digest than a how to book.
3,Nothing new here,I think this book is well written but there really is not anything new here. The conclusion of the book is pretty simple. There are fish in thise hills and the are not that selective but you have to approach carefully. So if you are expecting to get a lot of new information abot trout fishing it is not in this book. Most likely will confirm what you already know.
4,Strange things about this player,Does great recordings but really should do Mp3 but doesent... that said I purchased this exact recorder exactly 1 year ago for $76 - and have now lost it at work... can't believe the price has doubled since then... wtf
3,"Good, but I would look for something better.",This tape recorder has been pretty functional for me though there are a few things that I really dislike.-I keep it in a side pocket in my purse and sometimes the hold button is accidently pushed to the on position and then the battery wears out. I put a piece of scotch tape over it it prevent that but it is a pain.-I also put a piece of scotch tape over the battery compartment so that the battery doesn't fall out as well.-I would like a recorder with buttons that are larger so that I can push without having to look really close to make sure I am pressing the right one.-It does not play back very loud so you need a quiet room. I suppose it is good with the earphones though I haven't done that yet.What I DO like is that with DSS Player-Lite2 for Mac (downloaded from google) it is very easy to trasfer recordings to the computer. The playback on the computer is good.
2,Finicky,"I bought one of these last year and loved it for the first several months. The sound quality was great. It was easy to put recordings on my computer, and it was Mac compatible. But every time I've used it in the last two months, it's shut off a few minutes into an interview. I've replaced the battery, cleared the contents, everything. But the problem keeps happening, so I'll have to replace it with another model. As a journalist, I can't afford for my digital recorder to be this finicky"
3,Lots of background noise and sound is a little tinny,"I also own an Olympus microcassette voice recorder at 1/3 the cost of this recorder to record conferences. The sound is far superior and the background noice is low. I needed a voice recorder that could be easily downloaded to a PC, so I got this one based on the having a previous good experience with the Olympus brand. One huge plus about this voice recorder is that you don't need to replace or flip a cassette over every 30-45 minutes as the it can record about 6 hours at its best sound quality setting."
2,Worked for two months!,"I really liked this DVR and then it malfunctioned right after the return window closed.As far as sound quality - it is OK for unimportant voice recording. If you are going to use it for remote podcasting, you may want to spend some more money and go with the Zoom H2. The microphone recording is in mono which is lame.I mainly used it for recording ideas. I would then periodically transfer the files to my computer.After about a month I ran into the problem of No computer could recognize it. I have tried it with four different computers and none of them recognize it. This pretty much makes the unit worthless to me since i transfer my audio files weekly. I have checked the forums and there is no answer in sight for this problem.Now after spending all this money, i feel cheated."
4,Perfect for notes and meetings,"I work in an office and the WS-330M's been a great tool. It's made note-taking more effective since I can take my time and focus on listening in meetings instead of trying to feverishly write notes. There's a marked difference between the lowest and highest quality. The two middle settings are very similar. So, if you need more recording time, I would go with the 2nd to last setting (SP).Haven't used MP3 player mode yet. Don't intend to.Also, haven't used in large room / lecture hall. So, can't tell you how it does in there.PROS: Compact; lightweight; high quality recording; well designed interface; connect to PC w/o extra cables.CONS: Buttons almost too small; needs more memory for the price with USB flash drives being so affordable.Mine came with: USB extension cable (nice touch), headphones, AAA battery, manual."
5,Great Little Device,Easy to use; plugs right into the usp on my computer; sound is clear and the various files make it easy to identify music versus dictation.
4,Great little recorder.,"Hey, Mac users.If you have Microsoft Office for Mac, it includes Windows Media Player with the software. Problem solved for transferring and playing files on your Mac."
2,Good plot but too much talk not enough action,"This movie just wasn't packed with enough zombie action for my personal taste. It was a lot of talk and not enough zombies/action. I was pretty disappointed. If you're looking for gore and lots of it pick a different film. This film is slow moving and not gory enough for my insatiable appetite for zombies, guts, gore, and the macabre."
2,"Really bad, but it's quite amusing.","This attempt to cash in on the success of Lucio Fulci's Zombie (which itself was an attempt to cash in on the success of Dawn of the Dead) turns out to be a very silly and badly directed, but still quite amusing gorefest. Ian McCulloch is in this one, and he and Alexandra Delli Colli head to some jungle island to investigate a cannibalistic tribe. The gore is the movie's selling point, and the effects range from surprisingly good to hilariously awful, and the lovely Delli Colli does look quite alluring in the buff (note: she appeared about three years later in The New York Ripper, and somehow looked a dozen years older in that one!)"
1,I've heard it's gory but where's the gore???,I get this movie here based on many reviews but there is only very minimal blood in it... so where's the gore?
3,Light gauge,"I wish that product descriptions for cables would routinely note wire gauge. These are decently well made, but I am connecting them to a pair of active monitor speakers that are very revealing of noise along the signal path. The 26 gauge wire and overall construction is less robust than I had hoped it would be. Amazon was generous in offering a full refund."
3,A reasonable book to start with.,"This book has been around a lot longer than most books.It does offer a lot.A good guide from inspection of your engine to assembly,installation and tune up.Tom Monroe writes in an easy to understand way.His books are helpful so you wont be wasting your money.Plenty of information throughout make this a reasonable book despite its age.The 351C isnt included in this book.Its a good book and is worth adding to your collection.Good value.Its 3.5 stars as there are newer books out there that offer more."
5,This is so funny,"Check out what that kid wrote on October 25, 1999. He gave the book one star. Someone find him and tell him how much of an idiot he is. He wrote the dumbest thing I have ever seen. Who the hell reads Perry's cover to cover. Is he really that dumb just go buy a book about making bombs if you want to ""make bombs"". Another thing any normal person would realize after the first million pages is that Chemical Engineers don't learn how to make bombs. what a retard. Oh yeah, good book"
4,looking for equipment,"This book is very important specially in chemical engineering. But the price is too high (for people in the country like me, Indonesia)."
5,everything a ChE could want and more,"From steam tables to fracture mechanics, this book has everything from constants to theory. A must for any student or practicing engineer."
4,Perry's,Complete and cheaper than paper version.Easy to use on iPads.Could be better: tables and drawings when we use zoom.
2,Volatility,"For sure John is one the best bass players, ever! It happens that this album is quite ""difficult"" to listen to. You get started with some Cuban-African music and all the sudden you find yourself inside some standard-type piece. What bothers me is the volatility of this album. However if you like good jazz, try NOW (NOW is his former album), by the way, the best Patitucci's record."
1,IRRESPONSIBLE AND UNKNOWLEDGEABLE,I had awaited this book with much interest. I was very disappointed. The author is the epitome of irresponsible dog ownership! Nor are her conclusions about her dogs in any way accurate. I am appalled at the authority she has been given.
1,Scary,"I would recommend this book to anyone who was going to adopt a dog...as long as they promised to list at least 20 things not to do once their dog came home. I picked this up in a bookstore and library several times. It looked interesting but I didn't buy it until I saw it very cheap at a used bookstore. The store owner told me it was great. I think I should find out where he lives and take his dogs away.I'm wondering why no one else has questioned this woman's claim that she ""rescued"" her dingo but left the rest of the litter and the dog's mother with a neglectful, abusive breeder. How do you rescue only one from many? She's an irresponsible owner who bought from an irresponsible breeder...and then she became an accidental breeder herself. Only she swears she won't sell them as slaves because after all she does love them. (Heavy on the sarcasm there.) Wow this woman scares me."
1,Most Horrendous Dog Book I Have Ever Read,"I don't know what planet the author comes from, but anyone who allows her dogs to roam not neutered, mate without control, kill puppies, and then justify it as if it was some fascinating experiment is really sick. And whoever the people were on the book jacket who quoted what a great book this was, they need help, too. It was a disturbing book. I hope the author will be banned from pet ownership in the future. The worst part was the author acts as if everything she is doing is really interesting and normal. It was not. Don't waste your money on this book. You will hate it."
3,What do dogs want?,"That is the question the author is trying to answer with 30 years of observation. Thomas makes it clear from the beginning that this is not a scientific study but simply observations that she has made over the many years of owning dogs. The majority of which are huskies, but there are a few pugs and even dingoes in the group.It is quite clear that hierarchy is what rules the group and that dogs simply want to be with, or part of, the group. This book is touching at times because the love of her animals is so evident and their deaths are so sad. I have to admit that her ability to let them run in the city was not acceptable to my sensibility but the book as a whole was very informative and interesting. Kelsana 9/24/01"
1,A painful work,"I am struck by the widely differing views of this book by other reviewers. Elizabeth Marshall Thomas reminds me of someone who goes through life with more feeling than thought. If you are of like mind, you will find her book charming. If, however, you bring any intelligence to your own existence, you may find this book interesting, but you will surely find Ms. Thomas, reprehensible. This book is a beautiful & touching account of incompetence & irresponsibility. The author may well be correct in her assumptions of dog behavior, but reading her 'road to discovery' is quite simply, painful. For those who argue that the book is not about how to raise a good pet, I totally agree. This book is about how to conduct life and assume responsibility for it. We can indeed learn from the author's failure."
3,. . . But the Subtext Is Great!,"Since I agree with every negative review here, it may seem a bit strange for me to give this awful book three stars. My reason is that after I flew into several rages about how she ""cared for"" a dog left with her by a friend, and the nocturnal criss-crossings of major highways by this dog and the maniac author, I found that I wasn't reading to learn about dogs, but--as one does with a piece of fiction--to penetrate the character of the narrator. (Think, for example, of Poe's ""The Telltale Heart"". . . .)Thus I found myself laughing out loud from time to time. Hearing a dog bark outside the house, I imagined looking out the window, seeing a woman lope across the lawn and into the woods, and muttering to myself, ""there goes that crazy Thomas woman again.""You have to wonder if, as she wrote, Elizabeth Marshall Thomas had the least clue about what she revealed of herself! The book doesn't read as if she did. It's a psychological museum piece."
3,The HIdden Life of Dogs,"I read and enjoyed this book - I also read the reviews of the short-sighted people who failed to mention THE YEAR in which the ""dogs running wild"" took place - I believe it took place long ago - when we didn't have neighbors living on top of each other, people driving like they can't get there fast enough, and before animal shelters became over run with overpopulation. I found the book very interesting and think that the other reviewers might have given thought to the time in which it was written - a time very unlike the one we live in now."
3,"entertaining read, BUT that's all","This book was well written and quite entertaining to read, but it was more an essay on how to justify being an irresponsible dog owner than any kind of study on dog behavior. Read it for entertainment value, but it has no scientific value, nor does it have any useful information about dogs for the dog owner."
5,"Excellent Ram, Excellent Price",I just got this ram last night from Amazon and I installed it right away. I went from 2 GB to 4 GB. My performance increased substantially. I highly recommend this.
1,Not What I Thought,This book came up in a search for Catherine Cookson in Kindle items. THIS IS NOT A CATHERINE COOKSON Book. This book was rather juvenile. Remember that if you are getting items for your kindle that you can sample the book before buying. I wish I had known that before I wasted my money.
5,Don' sell us the perfect human,"Snapcase never got the recognizition they deserved. This album brings the pain it is so amazing the riffs that they spew out in each of thier songs. I actually like thier message too, something that a lot of people find unorginal. But think about it, how many bands actually tell you to think for yourself? How many bands tell you that you are your own hero, that you are your leader? So many bands preach that they are correct, that everyone else should eat their crap they are correct. So many bands take thier word for gospel, but then there is Snapcase. I learned so much from these guys (and I always am apprehensive about the things bands say). They have a great message, an almost perfect message. So while many bands claim to carry profound messages, Snapcase go on and speak thier minds. No preaching, all they do is ask ""are you who you think you are?"" An amazing record."
4,Snapcase sure can write a great rock song.,"The Kings of Buffalo still reign supreme. ""Designs for Automotion"" proves that it is possible to capture the energy of a bands live performance on a compact disc. Snapcase's innovative guitars and tremendous drumming, keep your ears ringing and head bobbing throughout the 11 rocking tracks. Musically, the band has definately matured from their previous albums. There is an apparent Quicksand influence in this album...which of course is not a bad thing. This album is everything you would expect from this tremendously influential hardcore band."
1,Waste of Money,"I agree with the previous review. The animals separate when you try to pull them along. We can keep them connected for a short while if we are exceedingly careful. Of course, our baby/toddler does not have the finesse which this toy requires."
4,interpretation that is somewhat dull,"the music, pace, tension are good. it is very very slow Please look for the same symphony by Sanderling for Hanssler or by Inbal for TELDEC. For the beginner this is not good. Four stars. The other versions show more action, not only build up without real conclusion. This recording makes it all too logical. There are two extras on this cd: two lieder des knaben wunderhorn. It is too short for compensation."
3,Getting old information,"This book might have been good when it was written, but it hasn't been updated. The lessons written for PHP 3 don't work on PHP4.1 or higher and the accompanying web site isn't very much help."
4,Good introduction to PHP/MySQL,"It gets you into PHP/MySQL enough to the point where you can get help on your own online for the problems you'll encounter. The book gives a good introduction on PHP and MySQL to get a grip on the subjects, but does not really go deep into the topics. A great book, but I was left desiring more."
5,Love this,Love Deva and all her music. This CD has a great sound quality. Very clear and simple. Wonderful to relax to.
5,Great Music For Meditation,"Great Meditation Music. I Listen to It now after I heard this in a Soul Journey To Abadiania Brasil. Heard it once there, and hope to hear it many more times there. Great Music. Was A Song Created Back For God. Worth It!"
1,"Good instrumental., poor vocals - this is NOT Indian music",When I heard the instrumentals I thought - what nice fusion music- but then I was sorely disappointed when I heard the vocals - the pronunciation of the mantras are worse than poor - and thats where the trouble begins and ends - because of theis the album fails to capture the essence of these divine mantras.
3,A Feminists Sociology....No thanks,"Sociology should focus on the study of trends in socioties. Not just the study of trends for minorities. This book does not fairly discuss the positive roles that many have had in society. White people cant always be bad, men cant always be bad just like women, blacks, and asians can't always be victims. Look for a better book if you want to teach sociology properly."
1,DISAPPOINTMENT,"I had looked forward to reading the book...but it turned-out to be quite a disappointment. Each chapter read like an incomplete thought. In the middle of the book Mr. Matthews discusses his time in the Peace Corps and his family...NOTHING FLOWED. I felt cheated and am certain the author is capable of much more...I would not recommend the book to anyone. I would also suggest that the publication be proofread prior to publication...note page 32, second paragraph, the word ""In"" should read ""It."" I am a daily viewer of Hardball..."
4,TV's Hardball expanded and in print form,"Chris Matthews tells of his background growing up in Philadelphiaas part of the boomer generation. He presents his opinions of the current state of the American politic from a combination of a historical prespective and an American movie prespective. The movies are being held out as representing what American think. Ironically in the same week I also read George Carlin's book, Dennis Miller's book and Bill O'Reilley's. What do all these books have in common? AS white, Catholic, eastern, urban, baby boomers, they have some similarilties in their background and do share some of the same thoughts. Matthews' book is easy to read and not very long. If you like Hardball, you'll love this book. If you hate Hardball, forget about it. And if you're somewhere in between give it a read."
2,HUH?,"I downloaded this to my Kindle Fire after searching for videos that promote social skills and I am in awe at how ""DRY"" it was. My 1 & 4y/o told me to ""turn it off"" after about 2 minutes (imagine that)! There was not very much dialogue, but more scenes of kids playing together, laughing, or waving. So maybe it's for much younger kids as mines had no interest. I ended up turning on NickJR and letting them watch Dora."
3,TV show is better,"I thought this would be pretty cool after watching the show a ton of times, but found that the show just can't be topped. This is just the TV show in a book with no great behind the scenes insite that I was looking for."
5,Jon Gordon is AWESOME!,"Another great book by Jon Gordon! His ideas are motivational, easy to implement into any busy life and results are almost immediate! Great book! Great, energizing ideas!"
5,Great OTT-LITE Replacement Bulb,"I needed a replacement bulb for my Ott-Lite lamp, but the original replacement bulbs are just not worth it. The difference between this bulb and the original Ott-Lite is that the Ott-Light is a bit softer, but this bulb is brighter. I recommend buying this bulb over the Ott-Lite replacement bulb because it's is almost 4 times as cheap (per bulb) and the quality is very comparable."
1,Bootlegging for fun and profit.,"Recorded in SLP mode, this tape is nothing short of hideous. A tiresome series of film clips clunked together with no rhyme or reason. This is at best bootlegging - and at worst pure unadulterated copyright infringement. Every clip was dubbed from some other source. The picture quality is badly diluted. Steer clear of this one at all costs!"
3,Disappointed in downsizing of scratching area,"Our cat loves this, but we had the same make from several years ago, and it was finally wearing out. Although the new one looks like the old from the packaging, we found the actual scratching area is around 1/3 smaller. The cloth borders are much larger. We will probably look for something larger the next time.If you have the older version, keep this in mind."
5,A wonderul adventure of human & animal kidness.,"I loved reading this book and never wanted it to end. It felt as if I have known Philip & Ginny all my life. It was written honestly and true I love that in any human... It went much to fast and leaves me to want more. I am so pleased that Philip and Ginny found each other. It was ment to be and I would enjoy another book..to continue the adventure of Ginny, the dog who rescues cats.. Thank You!"
5,Most Used,"Of all my cookbooks, past and present, this is the one I use the most. Quick breads, pies, impossible pies, desserts, etc. My now grown son calls frequently for the recipes. My copy is falling apart and food stained, all signs of its popularity."
1,practicly sucks!,"This game its fun once you get the hang of it. but to me its really really hard and itd repititive. every level (although im only on the second) you shoot like ten guys, kick a door open go on to the next level shoot ten guys. the graphics are pretty good the music is ok, but the two things i absolutly hate about it is that itts so hard and the controls stink. And hey ive had this game one hour and im already wrighting a review about how bbad it is. in my opinion dont waste your money on this game. much rather rent it."
5,Among the Gods,I enjoyed this book and the others that Lynn Austen wrote in this series.She did a good job portraying the life of King Hezekiah from a boy to his years as King of Judah and his walk with the Lord through Issaiah the Prophet. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys historical fiction.
5,among the gods,You need to read this series! It was extremely well written and the content was so revealing. You will not be sorry.
5,loved it,I loved the whole series. I was sad to finish them. Felt very connected to the characters as went through the familiar stories
5,Herman In His Presence,"WOW!! What an extroadinary compilation. If you are meditating orjust relaxing, the music that you hear seems to come ALIVE right before your very eyes. I can relate because the music on the CD can really be the underscore for your life's storybook. This CD is real. I recommend this compilation to any and everyone. My wife is pregnant with our daughter and all three of us give it5 STARS,including the baby."
5,Easiest wax ever,"I used this product for the first time last week and all I can say is that it is brilliant, literally and figuratively.It is easy to apply with the spray bottle and it simply wipes off. No more hard rubbing like traditional waxes. The best part is that you can apply to the black plactics on the body work and it leaves no white residue like traditional polishes do.The shine when you are finished is fantastic and the water beads and runs off during rain. I have been polishing my cars for the last 30 years with different types and brands and this is the best polish I have ever used by a mile, in terms of ease of application and final gloss finish.Great product 10/10"
2,"Intentions are good, actual product needs improvement","I was super excited when I heard about this bank. We have been teaching our children the same lessons with handling money. How to save, donate, and to spend.Intentions:This bank is separated into three different sections with a different building representing each section. One for saving (bank), spending (store) and donate (church). The child is to put the money into each section for its intended use. Neat idea.Our experience:Well, I would really like to say I loved this bank, but I don't. We could not open it to retrieve the money when it came time to spend and donate. So frustrating. So, if the intent it to be able to get to the money when you want it, this is not the bank for you. But if you'd like to end up saving more money than you actually intended, then this is your bank.Decide for yourself, but a good ole' fashion coffee can is looking better and better after this experience."
2,BIZZARE LUST OF A SEXUAL DEVIANT,"Sicko goes around knocking women out with some sleep agent on a hanky,strips them photographs them and then the victims wake up dazed and confused and thats about it aside from one of the victims trying to catch the sicko after she is a victim, more of a fantasy fetish film as opposed to a serious film you can tell this by the short running time of 57 minutes, which is also taken up by a long talking sequence of about 10 mins and unnessecary dwelling camera shots of the sky."
3,Cool bracelet,Bracelet is super unquie but it tarnishes quickly. Matches anything and I have had many compliments on the bracelet but overtime it wears not well. For the price not a bad deal.
2,"Yes, it is romantic and heavy","Of course everyone hears different regarding string players, and in Baroque Music it's even worse. Maisky's first recording of the Suites was heavy handed and poorly understood. I think he does no better in this new recording. If you want these Suites in a modern cello you should stick with the classic 1961 Pierre Fournier version in Archiv, after 40 years still a marvelous recording from the most elegant of cellists. But you would be wrong to think that period instruments are dry or austere. Do please listen to Pieter Wispelwey's new recording in Channel Classics, it's so vibrant and imaginative that it's a delight. This recording will get my vote as the finest recording available today, though Anner Bylsma on SONY should also be considered."
1,Worst Version Available!,"After absolutely being enchanted by the Maisky/Argerich version of the Back cello (gamba) sonatas, I had high hopes for these new recordings. Not only are the tempos a disaster ( the prelude No 1 is especially hideous) but Maisky even insists upon ending each movement with his own little trill. All in the name of ""romantic recording"". The tempos sound contrived at best. With the exception of the Prelude to the D Minor, which is glorious, the best hopes for this CD are use as a frisbee. Save your money!"
4,Easy cake looks impressive,"This pan really makes an impressive cake. I use a store-bought cake mix, and then dust the finished product with powedered suger. Looks great! Just make sure to spray the thing really well with Pam before you bake. I use a baby bottle brush to speed clean up of the pan when I'm done."
5,"A really nice pan,","I just got it. It's quite heavy. Good quality. I made a chocolate box mix cake as a test and it removes easily and smoothly using a can of spray oil with flour dusting. The flour dusting is visible on removal so next time I will try cinnamon and sugar instead. The top rose above the edges so I trimmed it off with a knife. The thing with this is that the shape is important so it's hard to decide how to frost. I guess a simple flavored drizzled icing is best. With a cake like this, you need a delicious basic recipe that can stand on it's own. But an exciting baking experience. Next I want to buy one of those Japapese fish shape cake molds and do a red bean filled fish...http://www.amazon.com/Taiyaki-Japanese-Fish-Shaped-Cake-Maker/dp/B00065YBEU/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid;=1354490557&sr;=8-2&keywords;=fish+japan+mold(not sure if the cathedral pan wouldn't be more beautiful...)"
3,"good material, bad answers in the back of the book","We bought this book so my daughter would have a copy of her schoolbook at home and shave the almost 5 pounds off the weight of her backpack. This has worked out great for us. The book is in good condition, and covers the material well.When my daughter is doing homework, she will check her answers against the answers in the back of the book, which are provided for odd-numbered problems. Every couple days, it seems like she comes to me to double-check whether she or the back of the book are correct, and, in these cases, the book's answer is usually wrong."
4,Good addition to my Quilting Library!,"Now I have projects for my growing collection of scraps. Good directions, super projects, good pictures. Glad I got this one."
4,"Yup, it's a mini!","I bought this for a co-worker that has an identical mini. It looks like it's of good quality and comes in a nice box. I didn't get a chance to take it out of it's box, so I can't accurately attest to it's quality."
4,The Littlest Matryoshka,Cute story! Our kids (boy 3 and girl 5 years old) love their authentic Matryoshka dolls so this story was a nice compliment to their beloved toy. I particularly liked how the book explained the history of how and where Matryoska dolls are made. I think the kids will develop a better appreciation for the toy after reading the story.
3,Good but could easily have been great,"This is a very rugged and stable stand. It is however somewhat heavy to lug around; with a saw, forget it. The instructions for set-up could have been better as well. I recommend getting different nuts and screws for the saw base. I have a Makita and the bolts are too long to allow the full right hand miter. This is minor. There are many sharp edges on the steel that I had to take a file to. A small detail until you have to get stitches. Also, the roller/rests do not align properly. This is also pretty minor as they are not true rollers. The Dewalt saw base is easier to use because of its instant clamp where the Stablemate must have its two clamps hand tightened with handles. Also not too big a deal. It does cost less than lots of other brands and is very tough. Maybe they will make the improvements to make this really great as they have a great start."
5,Great addition to any workshop...,"Extremely durable steel construction. The only problem that I found with it are the nuts that hold the extension bars in place on the bottom need to be changed to lock nuts. The vibration from my miter saw causes them to come loose and fall off over time. This may be a little bit heavier work stand than some of the competition, but you can't beat it for the price. It also extends out further than most other work stands. I'm glad that I caught it on sale!"
3,Good but Heavy Case,"The case is nice and solidly built.Pros: Solid build, and LOTS of fans for cooling.Cons: Internal light isn't bright enough, requires the computer to be on to use, doesn't go far enough in length to light up all parts of the motherboard that need to be lit up, and it is HEAVY. When I have to move it to do work inside the case I keep waiting for a hernia to happen."
4,Kathy Smith,This is a great DVD for beginners like me. I'm enjoying it a lot and trying to keep using it 2-3 times week.
3,"An innovative, daring mix of quartet gospel and soul/r&b.","Before the Winans and Commissioned, the Williams Brothers dared to mix traditional quartet gospel with soul/r&b grooves as far back as the late 60's. Songs to check out are ""Jesus will never say No"", ""Somebody needs you Lord"", and their parody of the Impressions song ""Finally got myself together""(I just want to thank you Master). The Williams brothers are true gospel music pioneers who have yet to receive their just due. Also check out their latest, Still Standing."
5,ROCKOON,"MY FIRST TASTE OF TANG JUICE AND REALLY LIKED IT...TD STARTED ME TOREALLT NEW JAZZ...ROCKOON IS STILL MY FAVORETTTTT....IF YOU LIKE EARLY TD, YOU WILL LIKE THIS CD...TASTES GOOOOD..."
4,Love White Castles? Get this book,"I've loved White Castles since the day my Dad brought us back to Ohio and found the nearest restuarant. This book is more recipe than scrapbok but if you're a fanatic about White Castles then the photos, stories and artwork in this book are a must-have."
2,Cute but derivative,"Not an original idea in the book, but if your standards don't go beyond manga swipes, you will probably be okay with this. The art isn't very well drawn, but fortunately, the computer graphics cover most of the pedestrian work. It is cute, but I wasn't particlarly excited by this work."
2,Senior cat,I purchased this product for my senior cat who needed to put on weight following an illness. He hated the smell and taste of it. He would not eat it even when food was placed over top of it.
4,"Band hits their creative peak, But grunge killed 'em","While most hair metal just did the same thing over and over again. Pussycat at least tried to expand their sound and that's what most of this LP contains. From the great ballads ""Nonstop to Nowhere""(a loser finds himself an adult with a wasted life) and ""Mr. Lovedog""(a great ode to Mother Love Bone's Andrew Wood who died of a heroin overdose). To some real horrrific events ""Only Way Out"", ""Body Theif"" and ""Maid in Wonderland."" While most hair metal fans will not like the albums somber tone, there still is some great music on it and the band sounds great.Basically, Pussycat knew the party was over and in a few months after this release(I actually saw them on one of their last shows in Philadelphia, they were great) so where they."
5,where there's a whip there's a way,"Don't judge this band as just another Poison or Motley Crue clone because they are way ahead in terms of songwriting ability. From the moment Nonstop to Nowhere crashes in you know this is going to be one ride you won't forget. If you like your double entendre you'll appreciate the tack of Big Dictionary and Loose Booty, whilst Maid In Wonderland and Mr Lovedog are great. This band are not averse to experimenting with sing-along, sentimental country flavours ('Friends') and transforming creepy telephone messages into self-mocking, industrial grooves ('Cat Bash').I can't find a single dud on this album. Perhaps the weakest track is Out With A Bang. Seeing this band live in 1989 was a blast of fresh air , but I do feel that this is the one '80s glam band that deserves to survive into the 21st Century."
5,First Rate!,"Excellent book. Every Southerner--no, every American--should read this book. Smith has done us a great favor. Southern baby boomers will especially appreciate the best explanation I've read of why things are the way they are in the South today. Smith makes history an enjoyable read."
4,Delightful! Ready to pack my bags.,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was well written, personable and full of wonderful stories that made the reader feel as though they experienced the year themselves.I got a fantastic pumpkin gratin recipe out of it and still make it in autumn to the joy of my husband .If you like Peter Mayle and Paul Theroux you will enjoy this book.Danielle Millar, Glenn Simon Inc."
1,Not worth it,Was not helpful as most of the ideas were hard to do. Other jobs listed in the book require loads of time and money and would probaby not bring in much money.
5,"""The only thing new is the history you dont know""","I bought a first edition of this book within the past 15 years from Tommys Books in Seattle, WA (WWI era history). I would consider buying a copy fromamazon.com to lend to a friend (the mass digitization project (google it) will eventually eliminate obscure titles like this and libraries across the country are purging their collections of real history books some (political radicals) buy up and destroy books on topics like this. I read the book cover to cover, and read it again,this is pure gold of WWI and Russian Revolution history. There is a suprising twist at the end during General William C. Graves 41st Infantry Division reunion dinner the FBI crashes their get together and gets them all to sign papers (much like confidentiality agreements you read about late 20th century military people signing)."
5,"Good, very good","This is one of the most impressive pure death metal releases i've ever heard. I listen to alot of melodic death, but when it comes to true death metal I only listen to a small selection of bands, and anata has become one of them. If you like death metal you will most likely enjoy this cd alot. \m/"
5,This is what Morbid Angel's new stuff should sound like...,"if they were to evolve instead of devolve. Anata may take it as an insult or a compliment, but this is like the Morbid Angel album I never had. This progressive death metal is almost hypnotic. I just got this album, so I'm not an expert, but I was loving it the first listen. Highly recommended."
4,Great Book,"I thought the stories in the book were very good and straight foward. I really enjoyed reading most of them. Some of the stories were better than others, but all in all it was good."
4,Correct....,"Avant tout, je crois que c'est un album fait pour le ''fun'' et j'ai toujours bien du ''fun'' à l'écouter. OK, il y a juste des covers sur l'album et puis??? Personnelement je trouve que c'est l'album qui sonne quand mme le plus Misfits depuis 1984 et que le vocal de Jerry est très bon. J'aurais mme préfèrer Jerry à Michael Grave pour les nouveaux Misfits..... Pis je trouve que Balzac est de trop sur le DVD."
2,"6 inches is too short to slice bread,","shun does forge very nice cutlery but the hype about slicing crusty bread is just silly:bread knives are best when substantially longer than the task at hand .Thefore they are usually nine inches long or even longer. th 6 inch lengh of the Shun sandwich knife would be fine slicing ccross a crusty baguette but would come up with a raggedy slice attempting the task accross a american batard loaf and could not even start to slice accross a standard boulle, a ubiquitous shape of European style breads. As a tomato slicer and mayo spreader the knife is better than fine but horrendously overpriced even at the very special price. For a spreader, I'd choose the Swiss made Victorinox and while on that finecutlery line by Forschner, I'd get an honnest scallopped bread knife:they have several to choose from,even a commercial 10 inch length that is wider than most - for rigidity.In other words: in cutlery there is no ""one size fits all"""
2,Disappointing,This book was so not the usual Mary Higgins Clark mystery novel. I had to force myself to continue reading it as there was no pull at all and really no excitement to the story. Hopefully her next novel will be back to her great writing.
3,She's written better.,"I am an avid Mary Higgins Clark fan, but was some what disappointed with this novel. She writes it in 1st and 3rd person, which is confusing to say the least. Although the twist at the end is typical MHC, I just really cannot say that this is her best work, because I have read much better from her. However, I still LOVE Mary Higgins Clark."
3,Typical MHC,"Mary Higgins Clark is like the Danielle Steel of the mystery genre. If you don't go in expecting too much you can be in for a pleasant lightweight reading experience. SECOND TIME AROUND was what I expected-middle of the road okay MHC-not great, not bad. It's a good beach read-something that you don't have to concentrate on too hard. It's the kind of book you can read in one day and forget about it on the next day."
5,A voice that soothes your soul,This CD soothes your soul and excites your spirit. The excellent music selection together with the grand voice of Sandra Kaye creates a wonderful listening experience. This is a great CD for entertaining guests.
5,Excellent Book Series!!!!!,"We own both volumes of these character training books. They are both excellent at describing each character quality. My kids LOVE them. Even my 2 year old! The stories just click with them. They really like volume two better cause the stories are more for thier age. It is out of print but you can google ""out of print"" books and this title.The pages look boring and colorless. I really thought my 2 and 3 year old would not be interested. I was so wrong. I think it is another aspect that helps them imagine more than be entertained by pictures. In fact I have copied the pages to certain stories for them to color. They think that is great. This is a book series I will be hanging on to for a long time. I hope to read them to my grandchildren one day (a long time from now)."
2,"Tall on tales, short on insight","How ironic that a writer whose Achilles Heel was character development should have a biography that suffers from the same malaise. I don't think I've ever finished such a long biography with so little insight into the inner workings of the subject. This book is remarkably shallow, spending page after page discussing Adams' projects but precious little space analyzing who Douglas Adams was and what made him tick. Even non sci fi fans are familiar with the chatty, insecure, name-dropping public persona Adams portrayed, but I was hoping this book would look far beyond that. Sadly, it does not, and thus showcases a man who is as one-dimensional and underdeveloped as the characters who inhabit his novels."
3,Pretty much what you'd expect,"Every two page spread has a number of farm concepts, with pictures in categories - birds, machines, baby animals.The pictures are well done, the language is simple."
4,A useful resource,I am a French Teacher and this is a key part of my library for that extra resource on grammar. It has very clear and well thought out explanations for every grammar point that a student of French would need to know. Coupled with the copious examples it really is an insightful text. All that is lacking is exercises to oractice the grammar they present. But there are many grammar drill books that can easily fill that hole.
5,Best I have seen,I own seven books on French grammar. Some elementary others purported to be comprehensive. Every book before this one raised more questions than it answered.This book will answer questions you did not know to ask.Brilliant!MJP
2,"Better than nothing, but not much","My nephew has a 2001 Buick Lesabre that seems to be developing one mechanical problem after another. I suspect it's related to him taking the car to a ""guy who works on cars"" who installed a subwoofer and amp and evidently spliced the wiring into the computer wiring harness. What a dunce! Anyway, my nephew needed help replacing a couple of sensors on the engine so I needed a source for locating them. This book looked like it might satisfy that need. I soon realized I need a factory service manual and this is not an FSM. It covers so many models and such a wide model year range, it's a poor substitute. Autozone sells these Haynes manuals, but they're shrink-wrapped so you can't see just how limited they are. Live and learn."
5,"A Ripping Good Read, What?","Readers versed in the Wodehouse canon will recall a delightful episode titled ""Extricating Young Gussie."" This installment in the Blandings Castle saga could be titled ""Gally extricates everyone."" It's not much about Lord Emsworth, and the perennially prize winning pig, Empress of Blandings, features only in a bit part. The usual bevy of imperious aunts cause the usual sackfuls of trouble for numerous tangled hearts. But the plot, such as it is, turns on Lord Emsworth's resourceful brother, the loveable rogue, Galahad Threepwood, and his Jeeves- like power to make things come right. While some of Lord Emsworth's behavior seems uncharacteristic, this later novel from 1965 is nevertheless prime Wodehouse and a ripping good read."
4,Yay Minerva!,"This is the charming story of a feather-headed (pun intended) hen who sees everything only in terms she can understand, which leads to hysterical discrepencies when she enters an elementary school. It's witty, fresh, and sweet, and kids will love it."
4,A different flavor compared to his previous works,"I purchased this album in Bombay, along with Mudra, and I noticed that both albums had a lot in common.You'll notice a lot more use of keyboards, thanks to his collaboration with Manish Vyas.My favorite track is the title track - Sky Kisses Earth. Starts off with harmonious voices blended with sitar and santoor and soon the beats kick in... like i said, a new flavor! However, his previous albums like Desert Visions and Hamsafar still remain unsurpassed as far as Im concerned, which is why I give this album a 4."
3,Well they had to make a bad one sometime.,"Humor doesn't always follow from one person to another, and get even trickier when translation is involved. As such I'm still able to give this disk 3 stars. (1-3 = 5 star, 4 = 4 star)I found these episodes painful to watch. Maybe if it wasn't another review episode (focusing on Pedro) its just too soon. The other episodes left me going ""Why am I watching this?"" Maybe it was a great Power Rangers spoof, but I haven't watched that series.I can't quite say it right, but basically all the 'humor' in this disk missed me. Here'd to hoping the extras are good."
1,jericho,i am very disappointed with jericho..it is in black and white and nowhere did it say it was in black and whitethank youmarion
4,Best torch value,I bought this torch in spite of some of the negative reviews because I actually tried it in a store. It was well made and had an easy to light trigger and consistent flame. Not sure what other folks were doing wrong. But I found it to be very good and easy to use. Very good value too! I recommend.
2,A drunk in flip flops staggers onto the Broadway stage...,"Someone made a mistake down at the CD plant and stuck a copy of the original cast album from The Boy From Oz in the jewel box for the new Rufus Wainwright cd. Wait, no, Hugh Jackman can sing better than this. This laughable, self-absorbed, ersatz Broadway piffle *is* the new Rufus Wainwright cd. Quel horrors!"
2,A load of hooey,"I can only agree with the reviewer who stated how hard it must be to be ""Poor Little Miss Wainwright."" What a sad state of a man he has become ... a crack addict who feels that everyone must love him in order to help him feel whole. This album seems to be one more example of an ongoing attempt to gain the attention he just never seemed to get from Daddy, who incidently is just so much more talented and together in his approach to his music. The lyrics on this recent Rufus release are impossible to make out, the references to much better songs frustrating, and the constant whining just terribly annoying. This album shows that, like with David Leavitt, too much success and attention is not a good thing for one's talent."
5,In Praise of Rufus: A Collection of Reviews,"'Wainwright out-sings, out-writes and out-romances any of his contemporaries. With a voice that breaks your heart with every lyrical slur and sustained cry' -Elizabeth Chorney-Booth'Sweeping and grand, Want One is an elegant and elaborate production of classically orchestrated piano-driven New York pop songs enhanced by choirs, horns and even banjo' -Sarah Quelland'This is a record of breathtaking, eccentric opulence' -Entertainment Weekly'If the brilliant 'Movies Of Myself' doesn't become a hit single than all hope may well be lost for popular culture' -Gregg Shapiro'A gorgeous meditation on emotional displacement, on finding yourself adrift when you want to love and be loved....If Sondheim had been reared on old Van Dyke Parks records, he might sound like this..."" - Rating: A- Mojo (10/03, p.120)"
1,Forget it,"This SACD is in stereo, not 5.1 multichannel & the sound quality is quite poor. I returned it to the store. And I didnt think it was funky at all!"
4,Still holds up well!,I heard this song when it first came out on local radio and was instantly reminded of Valerie by Steve Winwood which used to be my favorite song when I was in the 5th grade. I was checking out the video one night on youtube recently(the video is also a total eighties throwback) and had to download the song. I wasn't disappointed.
2,Not wide-calf,"I agree with the first reviewer, Wendy. I had measured the circumfrance of my calves before purchasing and these were not even close to fitting. Looked nice from what I could tell though."
5,Very informative,"Mr. Gurney's book was very useful and fun to read. It opened my eyes to the processes that headhunters use, and it showed me the best way to get my resume' noticed and my dream-job FOUND. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to find a better job. Find out how to do it right; read this book!"
5,Great speakers for a great price!,"I bought these speakers because they were such a good deal for 130 shipped, also because of the other reviewer here. Comes with 7 channels and a sub, and boy they sound GREAT, they are good quality. Sub is very packs a punch for 100 Watts, better then my last Onkyo 8"" sub by FAR. The speakers are very good, i can turn them up and have no problems with them cracking, distorting, or popping. I have used Yamaha speakers, JBL, and Onkyo speakers, these are just as good as the old JBL's i had but smaller. I use them with a Harmen Kardon AVR 247 for DVD's and Xbox 360. Gameplay is very good with these speakers with Halo 3. I tested them out with Star Wars also and it was GREAT! I have them plugged in though HDMI on both systems. Don't hesitate buying these they are a steal!Only thing thats bad is my Parents telling me to turn it down XD"
4,Very good soundtrack,"Michael Kamen and Eric Clapton already did some awesome work on LETHAL WEAPON and some more great stuff with David Sanborn on LETHAL WEAPON 2. Now they're back with LETHAL WEAPON 3, a great addition to their credits.""It's Probably Me"" by Sting with Eric Clapton is an awesome song, definitely one of Sting's best. There's ""Runaway Train"" with Elton John; one of the greatest songs on the album is ""Lorna-A Quiet Evening by the Fire"" - beautiful. There are some more awesome songs as well, but I guess you'll just have to find the CD. Kamen, Sanborn and Clapton are just as LETHAL as ever."
5,Corrinne's songwriting is as beautiful as her voice..,"This is the cd I turn to when I've had a bad day, when I need a pick me up, or when I just want to relax and here a beautiful voice sing amazingly heartfelt lyrics. Corrinne will truly make you feel, ""Safe in a Crazy World"""
2,"Meh, think about it..","The time one spends listening and working on all the cassettes is probably never gained back by how fast one might be able to read after going through this program.Howard Stephen Berg is a part savant; at least that's what it seems like to me. Unless you are very, very gifted like Berg, this program will likely sit on your shelf for many years until cassettes become extinct (aren't they already??).Just my two cents. For me, this was a gimmicky, foolish purchase on my part. I never became a speed reader, unfortunately."
5,"Go, Jupiter!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","Sailor Jupiter's the best! This DVD is the coolest! Or, I should say, Sailor Jupiter's the coolest! I'm the ultimate Sailor Moon fan, and I think that this is the greatest Sailor Moon DVD made! I'm also a big Jupiter fan."
1,Not entirely what it claims to be...,"Bottomlessly self-congratulatory, Geeks' unfortunate flaw is that it is more about Katz's savior complex than it is the two real-life protagonists it claims to champion. I admire the book's stated intent, and I was excited about the possibility of a book that gave a voice to and empowered the kinds of people I've called friends for most of my life, but in the end (literally and figuratively), Geeks is really just two hundred pages of Katz patting himself on the back. Wait until the part in which Katz almost single-handedly claims credit for healing America's disenfranchised and marginalized youth after the Columbine shootings. I'm absolutely shocked that he didn't try to find a way to work 9/11 in somehow. Avoid at all costs or read only for the truly interesting story of Jesse and Eric and attempt to ignore Katz's self-loving tone."
1,Geeksploitation,"Here is Katz back from his forum on Slashdot doing a bit of his own 'profiling'. He creates an interesting double standard. While attempting to defend a subculture of which he has no clue with his narrow vision, he in turn turns that group away from him. In this rag Katz documents the success of CmdrTaco and Hemos as they rise from CIS major geekdom to IPO bandits. It was Katz that brought some sort of notability to the site, as he had a lengthy resume of media experience. He proved to be a fish out of water in that forum as his usefulness soon faded. Yet he hung on like a drowning rat. Slashdot readers cannot stand his offtopic and lengthy counter-culture geek profiling diatribe as a rule, yet he is the bard of their fairytale. Katz belongs at People magazine, not a technology forum."
1,don't waste your money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I bought a can of Trappeys lima beans and they were horrible! My review of these beans prompted Allen Foods to send me 2 $1 coupons for their products as a consolation. The okra, corn, and tomatoes is what I used the coupons for. They were even worse than the beans. Mostly water, brown off color, tasteless, and basically inedible!Trappeys canned goods used to be very good. What happened Allens? Made in Mexico may be the answer to your problems! No more Trappeys for me; keep your coupons Allens."
3,Illustrated History?,"The author uses the term ""illustrated"" very loosely here. The illustrations are all in black and white and many are just small drawings that add little to an understanding of the weapon or its use."
4,"Great case, especially for Lumix TZ3, but needs one thing!","Case is protective and well built, like all Lowe cases. It fits the Panasonic TZ3 like a glove. The only improvement it could have is either waterproof zippers, but even as such, I think it is pretty resistant to weather."
1,Subject matter is the same old stuff. Not well written,"THIS BOOK HAS NO EXCITEMENT OR DRAMA FOR THE KIDS,THEY JUST REWROTE AN OLD STORY"
2,"Not Glass, Plastic","It's pretty, but not glass, it's plastic. Easy for my husband to install and looks nice, but not as described."
4,For your skin,My baby had some skin problem.One of my friend recommended this oil.This oil is pretty good for skin.
5,Well realised,"While it is many years since I read the Campion books, I felt that both series captured their style well."
4,captivating,"I picked up the 1st of this series at a local comic book store, and have not been able to put the series down! The art work is good, and the story line is humorous as well as slightly demented. I do however, recommend starting the series from the beginning so as to understand whats going on. I only wish there was more out of the series!"
3,Lacking in quality,I have used this product several times in the past and have always been pleased. This last package I got seems to be slightly defective. The business cards don't break apart as easily as in past They are not that bad but I am used to better perfection.Chuck
4,Fun for less!,"I like this cd because it was cheap for one thing, and I was pleasantly surprised for another. It really is a trip down memory lane. Being from socal myself I was able to see these guys live once before the ""rave"" scene took over the underground. The cd has a more personable accent to it than all the dance music genres that came after. Throbbing Gristle and Psychic TV were truly ""alternative"", (if not a bit painful at times), even by todays standards. ""Do Me"" is a track worth the money all by itself. LOL"
5,Come back to the Catholic Faith!,"I come from a Catholic home. I knew my faith well, but I did not know how to defend my believes when I got to college. I left the church and later became protestant for many years. If I had read this book in my early twenties, I would have stayed with the Catholic Faith all along. This book is a great tool for Catholics who want to know how to defend their faith when they feel attacked by protestant brothers and sisters in the faith."
2,"""He's the Chicken of the Sea!""","""The Big Mouth"" (1967) continues Jerry Lewis' filmmaking decline after his departure from Paramount. Though an improvement over the painfully unfunny ""Three on a Couch"" (1966), his second Columbia vehicle plays more like a San Diego travelogue than a family-oriented comedy. It's nice to see Jerry revive his ""Nutty Professor"" persona in a few scenes, but the laugh quotient is low. Surprisingly overrated, ""The Big Mouth"" never matches the cinematic inventiveness of Lewis' finest efforts."
2,Not worth the hype,"S-L-O-W! The pacing of this film almost put me to sleep and had I not seen it on DVD and had the capability to pause it every so often, I wouldn't have stayed with it. Yes, Phillip Seymour Hoffman did a remarkable job portraying Capote, but in duplicating Capote's distracting, effeminate mannerisms and nasal, mousy voice, it was hard to pay attention to the story of the film. Clifton Collins, who portrayed Perry Smith, one of the killers, did a remarkable job which I thought was more noteworthy than Hoffman's efforts.In short, I wouldn't recommend ""Capote"" and I don't understand what all the hype was about. I guess the crowd that revered Capote saw to it that this DULL movie got nominated even though there were many better movies this year."
5,Capote the movie,"Wonderful movie, with inspired performances by all. Even if you don't know anything about a movie, you can't go wrong taking a chance on Philip Seymour Hoffman and Chris Cooper. Excellent commentary as an extra feature."
2,Yes the acting is great but the story is not,I enjoyed the acting and I can see why Philip Seymour Hoffman won an oscar but I still dotn think it was the best acting od the year and I can see why Catherine Keener was nominated becouse she is a great actress but the story was boring. The film goes no where from start to finish yes I know it's a drama but some drama's catch you in the begging and your hooked but this film did not. The film is not a really bad film but it's not close to being good. The question is would I recomand this film the answer is i would not even thought the acting was good the story is boring and it drags on and on and on.
2,Uhhh....OK,"This movie...uh, I don't know, it's...well it is. I mean, I was on a plane and I desparately wanted to be engrossed in something, I was excited for this. However, when it came on, I found myself far more interested in walking around the plane and annoying flight attendants.I just don't see the merit here. It did not draw me in, I did not care, and I really cannot see what the hype is about. It just seems like this year at the movies was dominated by ""hey remember that?"" or ""a triumph"" because they were gay. I miss when a good movie could be art without being politically groundbreaking or a snooty affair. A big ""what the heck?"" goes out to Capote...enjoy whatever academy awards Brokeback doesn't get..."
3,Very slow going,"The actors are superb, but the film drags to get to the end. If you are sleepy you will not get to the end."
2,A boring movie,"I have to admit that I don't own the DVD but I had see the movie. I had great expectations but the movie was horrible, it was slow, it has no action. Maybe the history of Truman Capote is great but this movie was a big waste of time."
2,Dull,"The movie is well done. The acting is fantastic. However, had I known how boring Truman Capote was, I would not have bothered with this movie. I'm sure ""In Cold Blood"" is just as good as it claims to be, but the man who wrote it is just dull. I would only suggest this movie if you have read the book, or you already know all about Mr. Capote and are still interested in watching him talk about himself for 2 hours."
2,Cypress Gardens: 70 Years of Magic - Volume 1,"For a documentary, this was little more than a tourist video with musical background. Nothing about the water sky shows, the flower ladies. Not one word of dialogue. Don't waste your money."
5,Excellent Bible story books!,"This set of Bible Story books is the best I have ever seen. The pictures are wonderful. The books have stories that are not as commonly found in most children's Bible story books, such as Joash the Boy King and The Borrowed Ax. I had this set of books as a child and I am trying to find a complete set for my own children. I highly recommend this set of books!"
5,A great book,"A very truthful examination of the events in Yugoslavia, I recoment it to anyone who is looking for the truth about what happened here."
1,This Product did not work,"I purchaed 3 of the Vibrasonic molechasers a few years ago and they worked great, until they started to wear out and did not rattle very loud. I replaced them with the ""Supersonic"" molechaser and was extremely disappointed as they had absolutely zero affect on the moles. I left them running for nearly 4 weeks and the mole activity has continually increased. I will be going back to the Vibrasonic molechaser. Maybe i have ""Special"" moles."
2,Still skeptical after 6 weeks,I purchased 4 of these to protect a half acre area. I figured that would be plenty of coverage. One of them has already stopped working. I have returned it to the manufacturer for replacement under warranty. I am still skeptical about their effectiveness. I would be lying if I said I have noticed a reduction in mole activity. I'll give them more time and see what happens.
2,1.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:The historical significance of this film as the first ""talkie"" (sort of), has apparently blinded people to the fact that this is a slow and terribly contrived and formulaic story (even for 1927) without a surprise in sight; if you're interested in film you probably must see it, but otherwise stay far away."
2,Confusing,Used this for a course and was disapointed with this book. It seemed to make the subject matter more confusing rather than making it more clear. This book takes an interesting subject matter and makes it very uninteresting.
4,"A ""Must Read""","It started so many new thoughts and ideas on this subject in my own mind. I absolutly had no idea of what it meant until my professor asked me to write a report about ""Popular Culture"" and buy this book.I willingly read it (Maybe Non-Willing at that time hahaha) and I surely loved every single page of the book.Understanding this term has in some ways changed the way I look at the world we are living in. It has given me a broader way of seeing life and it has helped me in my analytical approach to life.Thank you Mr. Gordon Lynch for a wonderful book"
4,"great, but not excellent","My thoughts about this DVD can be summed up with one word. GREAT. But as great as these episodes are, i dont think they had enough action in them, and the story seemed a little bit drawn out. reminding me of some of those famous DBZ episodes where it would take too long for something to happen. Now dont think im talking bad about this DVD, in fact i loved it, i just like to give criticizm where it is necessary. i would highly recommend this dvd to anyone who enjoys a good storyline, some blood, and great character developments. so pick up this dvd and if you havent yet, pick up dvd-1:War Cry. and enjoy the beginning of a great anime saga."
2,What About Replacement Filters?,"This product works very well. However, contacting the seller and the manufacturer to get replacement filters resulted in dead ends.I ended up buying another air cleaner that doesn't require replacement filters."
4,Rosenfeld needed an editor...,"more in the parsimonious Ben Franklin mold than in the gabby Federalist one. I believe the author's premise about having history come to life in the words of the people of the times works -- I have a much richer understanding of the troubling times in our early nationhood (and a better understanding of the Lousiana Purchase -- something that had always been puzzling.) BUT to read the comments of congress, two or three newspapers and several notable people became very redundant. I found myself skipping and that's how I'd suggest you proceed. But it is worth the while if you want to learn and be entertained."
4,Great teapot except....,"... the spout design needs improvement. There is some spillage when I start and stop pouring. Other than that, it's a beautiful teapot. It's a great size for my morning tea, and I love that the lid stays put when I pour."
5,Great Movie,"Great actors and great director, great writer and cool ending. i waatched it in the original French with english subtitles. You notice that the english is a bit oversimplified in the translation and the little bits of the french that I understood were always different. anyway... the movie is good."
5,Very nice,"Not only is this an amazing and beautifully acted/shot/edited film, but it is also the earliest adaptation of any of Patty Highsmith's 'Ripley' novels. It's actually an adaptation of ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" now best known for the excellent 1999 update starring Jude Law, Matt Damon, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Cate Blanchett (as a character invented for only that version).Purple Noon is gorgeous, affecting and- with Criterion at the helm of this release- will no doubt receive a rich transfer.Here's hoping it kicks into gear a nice companion blu-ray release of the 1999 version and also perhaps Wim Wender's slow but oddly engrossing ""The American Friend"" with Dennis Hopper which was later remade into ""Ripley's Game"" which was later (hopefully) disowned by all the talented people involved with it.But I forgive you Liliana Cavani. I have to. My daughter is named after you."
2,In Need of Updating,"This book offers good advice to local community groups, but it is in need of a serious update. Although it is targeted to grassroots groups, it is often used by people in planning practice. Given the juvinile content of the book, and the limited consideration of current methodological standards and technology, it could result in a marginalization of citizens groups and practical planning efforts directed at them. Why do so many authors of these types of books think that citizens are stupid? Why do so many authors of these types of books think that freehand drawings are common in the urban planning profession? Why do so many authors of these books give examples of bad survey methodology to citizens? Obviously they don't understand that citizens are smart, and they are capable of presenting cogent proposals to public officials. Unfortunately, this book doesn't expose citizens to the techniques to make that possible."
1,Not what I expected,"This DVD is based on the short story Sock it to Me in the book Sex Chronicles I. If you read the story then you can practically imagine the video. It was very short, not many sex scenes, and those weren't HOTT like you would expect. But then again the story itself wasn't HOTT. My adivce is to pass on it. It looked really low budget, only one male who wasn't all that."
2,Powerful Stupid,The least favorite of mine of the series. The h was too whiny and unlikable. Her motivations for coddling her old son were weak and made little sense.
4,Historical fiction with much romance...,"I have really enjoyed these novels and even though they are truly romance novels, the historical aspect is well researched and very entertaining. My only complaint is the number of errors throughout all of the books-spelling, grammar, typos, missing words, repeated words. I find this inexcusable in a published novel and would like to suggest the author find a new editor. Other than that I found the books very entertaining and they satisfied my love of historical fiction well."
2,NOT CHALLENGING ENOUGH,"I have been doing Kathy Smith workouts for over 15 years now, and have several of her videos. I am a fit 50 year old and this workout was not challenging enough for me. It would be a good workout for someone who hasn't worked out much or is just starting to work out."
4,Excellent workout for fit boomers,"There are different workouts on this DVD to suit different levels of already-fit boomers. I didn't think this was a good place to start for someone who's just trying to get back into exercise, though. Even the low level is pretty intense, but you can dial it back yourself. At least you can grow with it as you get into better shape. Kathy Smith is awesome and does a great job of leading you through the workouts. My only complaint is that the workouts are too long and too intense - it's easy to overdo because you want to follow along and keep up."
3,Dull and lifeless,"Other than the picture from the fair proving Elvis didn't win second prize and did wear glasses, everything else in here was information already brought to light in Elvis & Gladys and other places---far more interestingly. The family interviews are dull and seem to be intent on flying in the face of the facts that everyone else remembers just to have something to say. Just because one relative said his mother didn't walk him to school everyday, doesn't disprove what everyone else in Tupelo and later at Humes said about seeing it with their own eyes. The writer's style is pedantic and doesn't really bring Elvis to life. It's just another stick figure portrayal that is all too common."
3,Required reading for Nicole Con fans.. but...,"I count myself as a Nicole Con fan but I found the parralled story lines difficult to follow and very confusing for the first few chapters. It was in fact two different novels but in this book neither one was given full justice. Lilian (A.K.A. Byron) is a writer who falls in love Cynara. That portion of the story is really only a written version of Ms. Con's artsy film ""Cynara"". So familiar it was distracting from the other story line of Spencer, an modern day filmaker who deals with work, life and loves. The stories at times seem excesivly fluffed which frustrated me a bit. BUT...the sex scenes were hot! Yes, there are some very well written erotic scenes that made this book worth sticking with."
2,good cover,"Have to agree with Litterati1 that the cover was the most powerful part of this book--seductive in a way the writing wasn't. The Paris in the '20s stuff with that insufferably arch critic character was actually my least favorite part: the Who's Who of ""artistic"" ""bohemian"" characters was like a gallery of twittering marionettes(anybody who grew up reading Genet's contributions to the New Yorker will have experienced the true standard for elegance and eloquent wit that must have been shared by those American expats)."
3,I gave in to it.,"This seems to be the month for falling in love with the un-cool in my CD player. First the Arcade Fire, and now this.Transatlanticism just seems to want so much for you to like it. Ben Gibbard's voice has to fall into that weird category with Ben Folds and Steven Page of Barenaked Ladies - they're so clear and plaintive, and the delivery is so articulate, it's hard to take them seriously. They sing sad songs, and you feel sad, but it's more cute puppy sad than messed up rock singer sad.And then on top of that, this album has enough pop hooks for three and a half Belle and Sebastian albums. Every time you turn around, you're getting pulled in again, until you feel like you've got a three year old leading you around by the shirt tail - afraid to lose you for even a second. So either you give into it, and let yourself be led, or you get annoyed.For the most part, I gave into it."
1,Booooooring . . .,"This band is so mind-bogglingly dull I couldn't get through the first three songs without fast-forwarding. Then it got even more boring. I kept hearing about what a great album this was, but even without getting my hopes up I was disappointed. You wait and wait for chord changes, hoping without hope that you get closer to the end. . . . Listen before you buy."
3,"emo, but in that almost good way","Like a lot of DCFC albums, this one deals with coupling, breaking up, falling in love, falling apart, and all the basics that go along with the relationship.though some songs are slow, a few verve on the dancing vibe, though not really go over the top to pure rocking. it's a good album for chill background music. older people (past the age of 20), might find this a bit too painful to listen to, but it will appeal to the younger crowd where drama rules the roost. this CD will piss you off if you're not in the mood for it. However, if you've just gone through a bad day, you might be able to handle it."
2,One Word Sums it Up: Disappointing,"I'm not one of those fan of music who kiss their death cab collections goodnight. I find them to be highly over-rated, but in the eyes of many hooded sweatshirt wearing emo (whatever that means) fan they are worthy of a Sunny Day Real Estate level of praise. Yes, I know how touching Ben Gibbard's lyrics can be and the words are huge improvement on that of those on the Postal Service CD. But there is more to music then the poetry a vocalist sings it is also about instrumentation. ""So This is the New Year, and I don't feel any different."" What a great way to start of an album, if only it didn't sound as though it belonged on the new Blink-182 record. The heavy distortion and high pitched (even for Ben) vocals through me off guard. The whole album just doesn't seem to flow and rather quickly I lose interest and find myself reaching for something else. Maybe I'll give it one more chance, but unless I have a revolution it's going on Ebay."
2,Pendant,"My wife loves elephants so I bought for her and she loved it. 2 days after it arrived the chain broke. A cheerful refund was given....ahhh, what do you expect for 20 bucks?"
3,did not play on dvd,This did not play on any of my dvd players (3) but did play fine on my blu-ray player. The movie was pretty good and entertaining.
3,Addendum to Roland Zwick's Review,"Roland Zwick's review of The End of the Affair fails to take into consideration the numerous errors in Jordan's story-telling, particularly when he writes that 'One plot flaw does, however, show up here: why would this man, whose job it is to spy on unsuspecting people for his clients, employ a boy to help him who sports a very distinctive birthmark on one side of his face?' Good question indeed. But let's remember that when Greene told the story there was a character called Mr Smythe (and no, not the priest) who had a birthmark on the side of his face, which went away when Sarah kissed him. Young Lancelot Parkis had no birthmarks, just a very bad tummy-ache."
2,overwrought melodrama,"The End of the Affair is a shallow, period piece capturing the heightened emotions and danger of WWII London during the blitz. The main story is the love affair between Ralf Fiennes and Julianne Moore which inextricably develops during a meeting at a dinner party. Each of the charachters seems to be familiar as they are never fully developed in the movie - the angry writer, the reserved diplomat, the amoral yet ultimately devout object of their affection. No new ground is covered here except for some of the explicit sexual imagery, which while pandering to the audience detracts from the seriousness of the movie and subject matter."
2,This books sits in a dark closet,"Want to learn flash? Get the FOUNDATION in Flash book. I ordered a couple of books for flash including this one. I though this would provide more detailed GRAPHICS and interactivity after the basics were learned. I opened this book, I then opened the Foundation in flash book, then proceeded to put this one away for future exploration. The Foundation in flash book was great, an ongoing project in each chapter to develop a flash site, tons of pictures and step by step instructions..etc.. I came back to this book and was amazed at how different, dull, and General it was. There really was no Special Graphics or interactivity here. The Foundation of flash book had more examples of actionscript and interactivity than this. So if your looking to learn flash, don't get this. If you want a reference book on basic flash with a little bit of actionscript that you want to keep in a dark closet to read again ""Just Incase"" you missed something, then, well this book is for you."
2,Stickly a temporary capet saver,"This is by no means a ""carpet"" it's a piece of microfiber that sticks to the steps. I'm selling my house so for protecting the steps from traffic it works for looks it's awful."
1,Misprint! :( :( Do Not Buy,This book was in perfect condition and had never been used. The downfall is that there is a repeat of Chapter 4 and NO Chapter 5. Had I known that the book had a misprint I never would have purchased it. It makes sense now that it was cheaper. I didn't realize it until the middle of the semester since that is when my professor assigned Chapter 5 to read. Of course the return deadline has past. I'm incredibly dissatisfied. :(
4,Great compendium,Great compendium of (some of) the most important works in math. I would have added some authors but I think the selection is awesome. Clearly explained and original works are well referenced.
4,A Browsers Delight But With One Important Defect,"It's not for everyone, but if you have a couple of years of college-level math, you can find your way through most of the material. Open to a random page, see what's going on, if it grabs you, find the beginning of the presentation and plow right in. Hawking's biographical/historical pieces are a delight and worth buying the book for even if you don't do the math. How come I graded one of the greatest minds of our time only 80% (4 stars)? The damn book has no index and it drives me crazy. Because of this defect, it's a pain to try to tie the work of the great mathematicians together. You miss out on an entire layer of interest that could be developed so much more easily had their been an index."
1,An incredibly bad recording,This particular recording suffers from some of the worst audio qality I've come across in an audio CD. It does Pavarotti no justice whatsoever.
3,Interesting discussion points,"This book is basically a laundry list of contradicitons in the bible. I like the book, and thought it would make for a very good conversation starter the next time a religious group knocked on your door, but I really wish the author would have backed up the contradictions with some discussion and historical perspective."
4,"A well-crafted, visually interesting intro","I enjoyed this book quite a lot and was put off by some of the other reviews posted here. This is a concise history that is lavishly illustrated with photos, artwork, and pretty good maps. It balances military detail of the battle sequences with background details about the major players, soldiers' lives, weapons, etc. As a popular introduction, it has its share of anecdotes, some fanciful, but that wasn't a major distraction for me. It would be a decent introduction to the battle for someone with modest familiarity with the Civil War, but I would not give it to the average teenager, as suggested by another reviewer. I also thought that the treatment of Longstreet was not overly negative; read D. S. Freeman if you'd like to see a really negative treatment. I have read 6 other books on Gettysburg so far and was happy to make this the 7th."
5,Gettysburg,"I read this before my 3rd trip to Gettysburg. Excellent resource for the 3 day battle. Very accurate when I compared it to other information available. Easy to understand and logically arranged. When a person is first mentioned, their picture or extra info is right there, you don't have to look for it."
5,"Wonderful, Readable History","This text is, in my opinion, meticulously crafted and researched. It's a perfect introduction to Gettysburg because of its lively text and spectacular presentation. Symonds' strength as a writer has always been his ability to devour all available information and articulate an insightful, thoughtful and original thesis. I would recommend Symonds' compelling biographies of Joseph E. Johnston and Patrick Cleburne as further examples of his talent."
1,Eleni VHS tape - Terrrible!,"After viewing Eleni on VHS tape, past thirty minutes of the film there is nothing but static!"
3,Good Christmas book,My kids love the Little Critter books. It is a simple and cute Christmas story. I liked some of the other books in the Little Critter series better than this.
4,Interesting views of the old ways,"This documentary is a glimpse into the lifestyle of Australian aborignes that is fading from existence. It ties the remaining population of a small tribe with the land, showing ritual and some ceremony used to keep the balance in life. I found it interesting to hear the aboriginal names of the animals who shared their environment, as well as learning about how each animal came into it's current form. The scenery is beautiful, as are the people and their disappearing artwork."
4,National Geographic - Australian Aborigines,Very clear and valid. Worth the study and it demonstrates how essential it is for Australians to realise the importance of our own and distinct culture - the dear history of Australia should also be available.
4,Not so noise canceling.,"These headphones have terrific bass, great sound quality, and are very durable. Although they do cancel some of the noise, a lot still gets through. If you are looking for silence I suggest you spring for an expensive Bose pair. But if you are a broke college kid, these are by far the best headphones you can get for the price!"
2,"okay for headset, not for noise reduction","Not a bad headset but as far as noise reduction...nada. But as the old saying goes, you get what you pay for."
1,"Disappointing, not recommended","Point 1) Unless you have tiny ears, these headphones will chafe you.Point 2) Wearing them for long periods of time is not comfortable. The head support could be better.Point 3) If you demand quality in your listening experience, these may not do. Adequate at best.Point 4) The noise reduction feature does not seem very effective. I work in an office that has an HVAC unit neighboring the outside wall and the noise is (unfortunately) still quite audible.Point 5) Broke after about 60 days of light usage at the plastic piece that secures the headband wires. End of story"
2,Uncomfortable,These are OK but the lack of padding left me feeling I should have bought another model. OK but not for me.
3,Not as good as other noise canceling headphones,"I bought these headphone on a special Amazon ""lightning deal"" to have a second set of noise canceling phones. They are very comfortable and pack well, but the noise canceling leaves much to be desired. I also have a pair if Senshauser phones and the are vastly superior to these as far as noise canceling goes."
3,"Great Travel Accessory, Audiophiles Beware.","for the price, i wasn't expecting crystal clear sound or mind blowing bass, but these headphones disappoint. They sound ok until you turn up the volume past mid range then the sound gets all distorted. the sub $20 senheiser hd 202 easily outperforms this model. The built in amplification/ active noise canceling is great but you can only do so much when dealing with such underwhelming sound quality to begin with. The way they fold and become compact is beyond awesome, so these should be good headphones for people on the go and looking to use them in an airplane or with a portable dvd player or laptop. I can't recommend these for audio listening though as the actual audio quality they produce gets easily exposed by 128 kbps mp3's played with the volume turned past mid. SO that's my take on these after 36 days of use."
4,Stylish and worth the price,"These headphones look really nice and do the job: sound pretty good and reasonably block surrounding noise. The headphones have some ""bass punch"", but not that much. The one annoying thing that I dislike about these headphones is: although they are adjustable, the adjustable height doesn't lock in, so if you desire to adjust them to a size larger than your head, they'll continue to readjust and snap to your head. Maybe the design was intended this way, but I sure don't like it. Other than this small issue, these headphones are nice and worth the price in my opinion. The look is my favorite aspect. The sound is good, but I'm sure BOSE or some other pair of headphones that cost at least $100 more would sound much better."
3,"Great at first, now not so much","I loved these at first, especially for the price - great noise cancelling, comfort, lightweight, relatively decent sound... after two months of use the pieces of plastic that hold the earpieces to the headband started slowly breaking apart, and after three months, I'm expecting them to fall apart any minute now. Consider them to be great for a little while, but disposable after 3-4 months."
1,Bad product,These ear phones are very defective. They broke into 3 parts in 4 months. Do not buy it.
3,Headphones,Ok product. Cheaper than most. An automatic shutoff for the noise cancellation would be nice. I have wasted a couple batteries by forgetting to turn it off.
2,Stay away. Stay far away.,I'm not sure who's rating these things but they should immediately draft a note of apology for all the customers they've duped. These things suck...and I've owned a few pairs of 8 dollar headphones. The dynamic range is nil. It's like listening to music with a pillow over your head. The noise canceling properties are negligible. I'd venture to say that most of it probably comes from the ear pads. They literally sound the same with the noise canceling on or off. What really makes them unusable is the horrible sound quality. Horrible! Just horrible (sob)!
3,Not bad for low-end headphones,"These headphones aren't bad and they do reduce outside noise somewhat. I bought them as a replacement for my Logitech headphones that recently broke and those blocked sound more effectively. I wasn't able to get a new pair of those since they were unavailable and I am sort of bummed about that. Overall they're not bad, and I like how they fold up to a nice compact size."
3,Noise-Canceling Headphones,"The price of these headphones led me to these over some other brands. I discounted the negative reviews regarding the tightness of the earphones. Well, they are very good at canceling outside noise. However, they are uncomfortable, not only because of the tightness of the headband, but because the earpieces are too snug and too small to fit comfortably over my ears."
2,"Comfortable to me, but cheaply constructed!",This model had good sound and was comfortable all the way until they fell apart. I bought a pair of these for $70 late last year. I rarely used them and was always gentle. Still even though caution was taken these Philips headphones actually and literally fall apart in my hands!!! Looking closer at how these headphones were put together I realize that the main problem is the small weak semi-circle brace that holds the earcup assembly to the over-the-head framework. I would have been more satisfied if Philips had made the construction re'clip'able.
2,doesn't work for what it is supposed to do,"Disappointed. Really didn't work at all and was extremely uncomfortable. Another item to the ""good will"" store. Left my ears sore. Might work better for someone who wants to use it for music instead of noise cancellation."
2,Waste of money,"It's not comfortable (see other reviews on this topic) and the sound quality is far from good. But what's really unacceptable is that when the NC is enabled, you can hear a white noise in the background, even if the environment is quiet."
1,headphone review,These headphones are junk. After using them for about a week they broke and fell apart. I had to epoxy them back together to use them. The sound quality was poor and the noise cancelling was only soso. I would not recommend them to anyone. Spend a little more and get Able Planets.
3,Worth the money,"Listening experience (non-noise reduction mode) is pretty ordinary, nothing exceptional. Haven't had opporturnity to test on airplane, etc. which is primarily why I bought the product. A better pure listening experience can likely be had for the same investment with non-noise cancelling/reduction headsets. Headphones fold nicely into attractive soft carrying case. Comfortable and light weight cover-the-ear fit."
3,Overrated,"I read a lot of reviews here which basically say it's nearly as good as the Bose QC.I've tried wearing this on the plane, and it feels like it only reduces the sound by around 25%, when flipping the cancelling on and off.Positives:- You get a nice bag- It folds quite convenientlyNegatives:- Don't expect the cancellation to be as great as some of these reviews say- The padding sometimes comes off, so you'll have to spend about 5 minutes trying to stretch it back on"
2,Excellent for the first 366 days,"I bought 3 pairs of these. The first pair broke in the first year. Philips replaced them. Then I went through the replacement set, and the remaining two sets. Each of the 4 pairs broke in exactly the same place: Where the metal loop meets the headband. The plastic just disintegrates and the headband metal straps poke out of the vinyl covering and into my head. Ouch.Purchased 12-10-07, last pair broke 11-30-11; so less than 1 year of use per pair on average.No travel, these just sat on my desk at work, or on my head."
2,Ears overheating from Noise Canceling Device,"I travel frequently and these were the first pair of NCH's I purchased. Overall, I thought they did there job canceling aircraft noise, but I could only wear them for so long because they made my ears and head extremely warm. At first I thought maybe I head a cold or something, but then it happened everytime I wore them. I returned them to BestBuy and am now on the prowl for something better."
1,Noise CANCELING???,Just received the Noise Canceling head phones. I was listening to our TV in the front room. I then put on the head phones a slight drop in volume about 1 or 2 percent was evident with switch on or off no big difference. I could hear the TV with or without the head phones covering my ears. The information submitted with the headphones state a 75 percent reduction in back ground noise.So I'll take them on a plane trip and see if the background in flight noise gets filtered out.At this time I am quite critical about the fact the noise cancelation feature will not wok as intended.
4,Great when you have a crying child next to you on the plane,"The noise-cancelling feature really works. I used them on a transatlantic flight, and they block out a lot of surrounding noise, which is great when you are watching the in-flight movie. They fold up so they are compact to carry, and they come with a leather pouch. The sound quality is good and they fit well on my ears. I would recommend them to anyone who flies frequently."
2,not what I was expecting...,"Don't waste your money on these headphones as a noise canceling device! They don't do the job, really poor nioise canceling power. The size of the muffle is too small so it doesn't cover your ears, it's not so big as it looks from the pictures. If you need just a regular set of headphones then yes they do have somewhat of a nice design, but as far as you turn the noise canceling option on it actually makes the noise even bigger in your ears, especially the speach. So just try something else ;)"
3,Ok for Sound and Noise cancellation not comfortable,I bought this product for a long International flight mainly for comfort and noise reduction. Noise reduction is ok but it is not comfortable for long flights.
5,Great product,"love the sound quality. Bass is good but not great, headphones are not tight around the ear,but overall great product."
5,a good alternative to Starbucks,"The local Starbucks can't keep these in and never seem to have a large package of them so I thought I would try these. Great choice. Cheaper, taste just as good and the quality is 98% that of Starbucks. (more beans are stuck together or missing a bean inside the chocolate) The convenience and price however make up the difference. PLEASE do not think these are low quality, they are not at all. Very good quality just a slight notch below Starbucks."
1,Keoki crazy meth freak?,"I'm tired of people saying how great keoki is .Some went as far as saying he is a god , I strongly disagree .Moonshine records should be concentrating there efforts on some of there lesser known artists . Only thing good that came out of this album is the first track by Coldcut ""Every Home A Prison"""
3,"Close, but no cigar","Most of the cast is brilliant. I think casting Reese Witherspoon as a Brit is wrong, wrong, wrong. While she does a decent job with the accent, her mannerisms are totally modern and American. Watching that was like pouring ketchup on Chinese food. It just didn't go together. As for the story, it was entertaining enough, but it wasn't the hilarious movie I was promised. The scenes and costuming were incredible though."
1,MY Mistake,I made a mistake. I bought this movie. It was a waste of time to watch this and I recommend you do not make the same mistake I madr.
3,A bad revival of an Oscar Wilde play,"At the time this was written these upper-class ""pretenders"" were scandalous,but that has gone with even more scandalous time three times over.Reese Witherspoon is just out of place in this and has no where near the Received Pronunciation necessary to carry it off. Colin Firth as well failsin making the period work. In contrast to the British Rupert Everett and Judi Dench who have it, they just don't.Since I like the play and have seen an older better classic version of it,I realize that they tried and just plain failed. They just didn't make you believe in the English manners or the scandal involved in the playof a foundling. They just weren't English enough."
5,The most important film I have ever seen!,"I began to study The White Rose about 3 years ago and have since watched this film over a dozen times. After visiting the actual locations in and around Munich, Germany, I am still amazed at the detail which went into this film. Actual locations were used (the university atrium where the Scholls were captured) and survivors were interviewed. One survivor personally told me he believed this film to be a reasonably accurate telling of the story. As an outsider, I say it's brilliant."
4,An Enjoyable Collection,This is a great selection. The only problem I have is that the songs are often a little too short and leave you wanting more. But it is great for a classical beginner who wants to experience all the most popular tunes.
3,Good for those starting out,"Good book for those just getting started making vegan/vegetarian meals for kids and if the kids are still young. No new, creative ideas if one has been at it for awhile. Many of the meals are not necessarily typically kid-friendly, so older children used to a different (more mainstream) way of eating may not be receptive. In addition, several of the recipes are too complicated to be considered ""quick."" Lastly, I was annoyed at several ""egg-free"" recipes that were not vegan. Vegetarians will eat eggs, so why not make all the egg-free recipes vegan?"
4,This one is pretty good!,"I actually use one a lot. I have some little offspring and they can be picky little eaters. I really like these recipes, and much like the rest of my cooking, I incorporate a lot of my own idea into the recipes. This cookbook is great to have. Very glad I bought it."
5,Definitely worth the read,"A Southern writer, Godwin captures the family life of the titular characters after the father dies. The women are all very different, but this touching book shows how family is important and how being independent isn't a bad thing. After the father's death, each character examines her life and future. I found it very real and interesting. Though the epilogue was a bit blah."
1,Not recommend!,"I bought this CD collection in the hope adding my Mantovani collection..I was very much disappointed.First of all, the recording is of poor sound quality..the selections are in disarray.There are other individual Mantovani CD's..better get them,rather than sacrifice this boxed set..it's your money not mine!!!!"
1,There's no place for electronica and house music in the rock world,"It's not THE Baldwin brothers your thinking about. There's not even a Baldwin in the group. Which is good, because even the screw-ups in that family wouldn't want to be caught in this electronic/pop rock disaster. There's no place for electronica and house music in the rock world."
2,too many plastic parts that seem light and flimsy,I purchased this printer at the end of January and by the middle of February after only printing about 20 borderless 4X6 pictures direct from memory card the printer failed. It prints about 3/4 of the picture and then something happens with the rollers inside that turns the picture paper to an angle and wrinkles the paper and the print comes out unfinished. I am very disappointed in this printer. I am returning it to store to try another one more time. If this one doesn't work properly then I am going to try another brand. For the record the software and features worked very nicely. It is just mechanics inside that seem cheap and flimsy.
2,My last HP printer,"This printer has gotten little use in a year and a half due to many small problems that were fixable, but annoying. Now the print cartridge cradle is jammed. After exhausting the few suggestions offered in the manual and on line by HP, I called customer service and was offered the chance to pay $30 to speak to a technician...with no guarantees of success, and no credit towards any needed parts or labor. Maybe I'm spoiled, but with four HP printers and a fax in the house I somehow expected more.I'm throwing it out."
4,Very Good Story for Catholic Readers (and others!),"This is the second novel by O'Brien I've read, the first being ""Father Elijah"". Sophia House is a prequel to Father Elijah. The story is dramatic and the ideas in the book should be absorbed by Catholics (well, all Christians, but the intended audience is probably Catholic). And presenting the ideas in the form of such an accessible novel is wonderful. I genuinely liked the book although there is occasional weakness in the dialog. But keep reading anyway. The ending is dramatic and it left me wanting more. This book warrants re-reading but I think I'll go back and re-read Father Elijah first.Once again, Ignatius Press has published a book that really does matter."
4,3rd book of the trilogy makes up for the 2nd book,"The 3rd book of Ms Aidan's trilogy finishes off Darcy's version of events with most of the previously introduced subplots being tidied up and, of course, resolution with Darcy and Elizabeth.This book is closer to the 1st in the storyline tightness, unlike the 2nd book, which wandered a little here and there too much.All the characters, especially Fletcher and Dy (Aidan's own supporting characters )continue to fascinate and humor. The subplots introduced in the previous volumes intertwine. You can appreciate the thought and work the author put into the overall storyline and all the different subplots.Very enjoyable read and it makes getting through the 2nd book worthwhile."
2,Disappointing,"I read a few sequels of ""Pride and Prejudice"" from different authors such as this one, and, frankly, I found them all a bit boring. It's very rare that authors will write a sequel of their novel. Victor Hugo never did and so other great novelists. So, why bother trying, I wonder. Because it never equals the real one. I won't finish reading this one, I will rather read again ""Pride and Prejudice"" from Jane Austen that is so brillantly written."
1,waste of time,"I appreciate her effort, but how can anyone improve on what is almost perfect. Re-read her (Austen's) novels. No one can imitate her style and wit and writing and come anywhere close. I am baffled by all these glowing reviews!"
5,BEAUTIFUL,"This book was an absolute treat for those 'romance buffs' who are interested in the plot concerning the gentleman Darcy as a character. I found the book to be excitingly romantic, comedic, and extremely interesting to the point that I could not put it down. The first two books are equally great, so I suggest buying them all together so you don't have to wait in anticipation for the next! You will not be dissapointed! Thank you Pamela Aidan for the wonderful novel! I only wish that it could last forever!"
4,Well done,"Although this volume alone (the last in the series)is longer than Austen's Pride and Prejudice, it is still great reading for all P & P fans. We know much more of Darcy's thoughts here than of Elizabeth's in Austen's work, but they are in keeping with the tone of Pride and Prejudice. The writing is good enough to keep the story moving well. The conclusion of a couple of ""side"" plots adds to the enjoyment. Highly recommended."
5,The Magnificense of the Universe and our Creator,"Louie Giglio hits it out of the park with this one video message of the mysteriesof the creations of the depths of the Universe. God created something so vastand so endless and so full of wonder and amazement, most men's minds cannottruly understand it. But, Louie Giglio delivers some amazing evidence basedin Scripture and proof through science that God is Great!!!! I highly recommendthis dvd for any person, regardless of faith or belief. It is fantastic!"
5,Surprisingly Great,"I was a bit apprehensive about getting this. I was really worried about the sound quality and the approach to the songs. The only things that I had ever heard from Tommy Sands up to this point was ""The Worryin' Kind."" However, I did a little research about Mr. Sands, and I ordered this album, as well as the album entitled ""The Worryin' Kind"" from Bear Family. The songs are good, and have a great quality about them being from smaller markets and from being so dated. Tommy really had a decent country voice and you can tell that he just loved the genre. It's a shame he didn't stick to more county and rockabilly later in his career. Everyone had to make a buck I guess."
4,Compound Chrstmas Ornaments,I have had a chance to cut a few of the patterns in the book. Compound cutting is fun and the results can be amazing. The book is well worth the price. I wish the book was downloadable as an ebook with the print function enabled so I could print the pattern needed rather than having to scan it in on my flat bed scanner then printing it out.
4,This CD is off the chain!,"I have enjoyed this cd. I wasn't able to watch the actual show on MTV, but I felt as if I were right there in the audience. It has all of my favorites songs from her album all in one."
1,That's Wrong!!,"I'm sorry I know some of you will click the button dissing me without reading what I have to say because I gave the cd only one star. The reason I did that is because of the single ""Unbreakable"". I know that this single is popular now but it's wrong. ""We can fight like Ike and Tina."" Ike and Tina didn't fight she got the sh** beat out of her for several years until she decided to fight back and leave Ike. Any person or any woman for that matter who can right a song and use another's woman's abuse in her lyrics and then go so far as to have the song produced and released needs to find herself some direction."
3,Nice album but lacks soul or the 'wow' factor,"I am a huge Alicia Keys fan. She's one of the few that combines raw talent and beauty. However, I find that while this Unplugged CD is NICE, it's not something I would go 'wow', or go out and tell people to get it. It's decent--no surprises. She does the intros very well. As a piano player myself I certainly appreciate her mixing classical music to her brand of soulful songs, but this album lacks SOUL...I like it overall, but her very first album is by far the best of all."
2,Unbreakable SUCKS,"That song is so lame and wack. The chrous is really lame ""Through The Technical Difficulties"" what the hell? Only Alicia Keys would squeeze in something so lame and stupid. But besides this on going sample of a song that artists have using since the original been out is getting on my nerves. Come on she could of dropped something more original and well thoughtout then this Unbreakable. This is some mess her label done through together to keep her name out there and it worked. Alicia composed an Unplugged album to keep people saying Alicia Keys is so talented, Alicia Keys can sing, Alicia Keys is the best artists out today. But come to think about when was the last time MTV hosted an Unplugged Special? I am tired of Alicia Keys, she hasn't taken a real break since her debut and her singing is very average as people have been mentioning. Beyonce can sing better then Alicia Keys."
3,Here We Go Again....,"It's starting to seem like everytime an artists gets famous enough, record companies decide to have them put out any old thing and bleed fans out of another $20; no matter what the finished product soounds like. I bought this album after all the hype and I wasn't impressed at all. No doubt, Alicia Keys is very talented, but this unplugged album is a disappointment. I feel that she has put on better live perfomances in the past and that one of those shoul've been recorded and sold instead. I feel that I'm listening to her back up singers more than her, and they sound pretty good, but their names aren't on the album cover,maybe they should be."
2,Protection Prevents you from playing,"I'm pissed off that I got this CD and can't load it to my iPod!!! The CD won't even play on RealPlayer, Windows Media Player or anything else, except the software that the CD has on it that you must install onto your computer. You can only play this CD with the CD's software!!! BAD! I paid for it, I want to do what I want with it!"
4,Live Keys,"Alicia Keys has revived the MTV Unplugged franchise with her show and this album. Ms. Keys doesn't go the traditional unplugged route of stripping the songs down to their acoustic base, but she gives a stellar performance. She doesn't alter the grooves from the studio versions, but she lets the songs breath and flexes her voice muscles without going over the top. ""Karma"" and ""Heartburn"" perfectly segue together in a funky mix. ""Fallin'"" has a haunting violin and the combination of Gladys Knight & The Pips' ""If I Were Your Woman"" and ""If I Ain't Got You"" is the best moment on the album. There are several other covers on the album and they are hit and miss. The Rolling Stones' ""Wild Horses"" is a duet with Maroon 5's Adam Levine that never gels while her take on Brenda Holloway's ""Every Little Bit Hurts"" is a high note. Ms. Keys burst on the scene in 2001 with much fanfare and she has more than lived up to the hype."
3,her voice doesn't do it for me,"so I've been listening to this for the first time and it's disappointing. Her voice sounds very limited to me and what I thought as the tracks went along is that maybe she's a smoker so I looked it up and she does appear to be one. She was a perfect chick when she first came out. It's unfortunate that she is self-destructive, particularly to her great instrument, her voice. The band is pretty engaging but the singing is not quite there, and she talks too much in her songs."
3,Alicia Keys Need's To Set a Vocal Limit,I'm kind of on the same boat with her vocal ability. Alicia Keys might be one of the better artists today but her vocals are not. I understand she's trying to bring music back but she is going to need to work on her singing more. What is an Unplugged album if you cant enjoy the singing. I have heard plenty of Unplugged albums and I've never had any compliants about the vocals. I think Alicia Keys tries to oversing but in reality her vocals are limited and not as powerful as she tires to push them. She need's to find her ability as a singer and go from there and stop straining her vocals because that will only effect her voice in the future and she will really start sounding a mess like Chaka Khan does today. But Chaka Khan is older Alicia Keys is not.
2,Warning--not the book that the title/description suggest!,"I picked this book up thinking that it was about the psychology of gamblers and gaming, and was ultimately disappointed. This is a book about literature, authors, and fictional characters, and there is no real psychology or non-fictional content about gambling at all! Knapp devotes each of nine chapters to a different author and a specific character from that author's work. All of these characters happen to be gamblers, but even the use of ""gambler"" is loosely defined--some of the characters could be better classified as ""people who make a decision with some risk."" Most of the book's content thus focuses upon the nine authors, and how they created these characters in their works.Perhaps if I had been a student of literature, I might have found this book interesting. However, as a reader who was looking for insight into the psychology of gambling, I was extremely disappointed, and, frankly, quite bored by this book."
5,VP of No Review,"I have a small business and I'm always looking for new ways to communicate with my employees without seeming like I'm lecturing. I bought this book and everyone in the company read it and talked about it. It is simple and easy to read and very, very insightful. I think it would be especially helpful for those new to the selling world."
5,School House Rock Live 5 Star Review,"If you are a fan or into nostalgic televisions shows, this dvd hits the mark. Disney took control of this compliation of all the hit Saturday morning cartoon episodes. So if you were a fan or have 5-12 year old kids, it will give you both something valuable to watch. I believe this holds kids attention as when I saw it when I was my daughter's age. If you are an educator, then this product would be an excellent purchase for your school. It was an excellent investment. My family has enjoyed it very much. One final thought. Skip over the many Disney commercials for their products. Just go to the main menu.TPW"
5,What fun!,"I didn't watch this at all when I was a kid. I think it started just at the age I stopped watching Saturday morning cartoons. So, I got it as an adult and watched it. What fun! Soon my kids will be watching them too I hope."
5,Do I Really Need to Review This?,"Let's put it this way - I learned more from School House Rocks than I did from grammar school, way more. I hummed those tunes throughout my US Gov't class finals in high school - And when I popped this DVD in for my daughter for the first time, I was honestly astounded at how many of these little gems I still knew by heart. I think any child of 70's will agree, no review necessary - School House Rocks rules."
3,School House Rock!,"Seller shipped quickly! DVD/CD is okay. It's not much different than the original School House Rock tapes. The positive side to it is that it's all one disc. However, I didn't think it was very well organized which made it a hassle to use in the classroom. The grahics were much better than the old ones. I would recommend it for younger children, maybe 4th grade and below."
2,NOT in used/good condition,"The dvd was listed in used but good condition. What arrived was a case that was completely broken down the spine. The cover was scarred and sticky, like a three year old had attacked it with a jelly doughnut! The dvd itself has scratches, but none so significant that it hasn't played the tracks that I need. This was purchased because I teach American History. I don't have time to go through every track. When I get to them I'll find out if they work.Bottom line....never again from this seller"
5,My Daughter Loves It,My daughter loves her Schoolhouse Rock! video. It is great and I enjoy the trip down memory lane. The video is great and truly helps with her timetables and with her grammar. Wonderful way to keep the kids memory fresh.
2,Good videos but disappointing,"My three year old twins love School House Rock Earth, so I decided to buy this to expose them to more of the School House Rock videos. Unfortunately, this DVD has menus, sub-menus and sub-sub-menus. Ridiculous!!! I was expecting the DVD would be a compilation of the songs back to back without all the menus. So I of course can't play it for them in the car as that would be too much manipulation on my part and I prefer to not get in an accident. I wish the DVD would have been compiled better."
5,Relive the videos you loved as a kid!,"All those videos you remember and sang along to are here - ""Conjunction Junction,"" ""I'm Just a Bill"" and the rest. When shown on HD, the pixilation shows from its older recorded format, but the sound quality is good. Show these to your children and grandchildren, and sing along like you used to!"
5,Memories!!,I've always sang Schoolhouse Rock songs around the house and to find the DVD with all the songs on it was awesome!! My daughter loves it and it's helping her learn her multiplication as it helped me a zillion years ago!
5,Felt like I was 5 again,"I could not believe they finally released this gem on DVD. Schoolhouse Rock was the greatest thing ever to happen to Saturday mornings. I do not think there is any child born after 1970 who did not learn from this. Very rare is the product that educates+entertains at the same time. I learned about our country's beginning through ""No More King""+""Shot heard round the World""+the Solar System from ""Interplanet Janet"". My personal favorites are ""Preamble""+""Interjections"". Along with Sesame Street+Mr.Rogers this was probably the most influential program for my Genereation. Parents of today have been given a great gift for thier own children. Schoolhouse Rock Rocks!!!"
4,Great Hot Sauce,Great hot sauce but terribly overpriced here . With shipping the 4oz bottle will cost you more than $10. . The local grocery store has it for $1.79 everyday .
5,Pretty Good Hot Sause For Soups & What Not,"I like this hot sause also, not as much asEl Yucateco XXXtra Hot Kutbil-ik Mayan Style Habanero Hot Sauce - 4 oztho. I have a hard time eating this sause when its dumped over a plate of Mexican food. I use to to heat up weak salsa, add a little kick to soups and what not. The flavor is good, but theres just something about it. I have alot of both sauses stocked up for survival / food storage reasons. It's something to have on hand during hard times. I buy mine from out local Mexican Tienda which we just got not too long ago, anyways if you want to try something hotter then this sause give that Mayan sause a try and be careful with it."
4,"Good flavor, great with Mexican dishes","El Yucateco makes a bangin' sauce. It's fairly thick and sticks well to food (not too runny). It's sweet, and it's got a little bit of kick to it. I'd give it a 4/10 for heat, a 7 or 8 for flavor.My only issue is that it only tastes good on Mexican food. I've tried it on pizza and eggs (staple hot sauce foods for me) and I was left disappointed. But on a taco? This hits the spot."
3,Not Delinsky's best work...,"I am a longtime fan of this author. However, how does an accomplished author like this get away with such glaring errors in the book? Two examples; Paige goes to talk to the girls at the school after Friday's funeral. Why then, do they get in trouble for not attending the mandatory study hall which takes place Sunday through Thursday evenings? It's Friday! Also, reference is made to it being near Labor Day, as well as it being the beginning of summer. Did she mean Memorial Day? These are just a couple that I noticed right off the bat. I expect an author of this caliber to be more accurate, and not leave these items in the hand of the editor and proof reader."
5,Wow!! Wow!! WOW!!!,"Regardless of whether you are interested in learning MFC at all, you just have to be impressed with this book. The organization of it alone is in a class by itself. Equally impressive, though, is the content. Answers to your questions seem to flow from the pages as if the book were reading your mind. The material the author covers is extremely useful, and organized in an easily accessible way. I wish that more book were available like this."
4,"I'm new to MFC, I've been using it as a reference every week","As someone new to MFC, I find that the book is the perfect format to allow me to look up a topic within MFC that I would like to implement, but one in which I do not have any experience yet. I've already saved hours by using the information in chapters 5 (Property Sheets) and 6 (Toolbars and Status Bars). My only hope is that there is a 2nd edition that would add more chapters to answer questions concerning topics such as sockets, multi-threading, databases, etc. It would also be great if Mr. Kain could cover examples of how you add functionality to a project that did not include the functionality when the project was created (ex: database support to a project that was created without database support)."
1,Questions for a well rounded application are not included,The one question I came searching for answers on was about pop up help and HTML help API in property sheets ... if the answer is here I couldn't find it.
5,MFC Answer Book is a WINNER !!!,"Eugene, I cannot thank you enough for writing the ""MFC Answer Book"". As a Visual C++ programmer with 10 plus years experience, it's great to see a book as unique as this one. It saves my life at least 3 times a day and has saved me countless hours of development time.The format is excellent and not only helps me out with my projects but it is an incredible learning reference that is easily understood.thanks again...p.s. One request. Write more books"
5,Marilyn Monroe killed Clark Gable making this movie.,"Blonde gets divorce in Reno, and proceeds to hang out with a group of guys who catch wild horses and sell them for dog food."
4,James and Peggy Barton are great in this!,"James Barton and Peggy Barton are just fabulous in this film. I'm not sure if they're brother and sister, or brother and transvestite, but they're just wonderful. I'm not even quite sure who they are in the film, but they sure are terrific. Marilyn Monroe and Clark Gable are in the film too, it was the last film either of them made. And Thelma Ritter offers great support, and Montgomery Clift and Eli Wallach are excellent too. But I can see why Amazon stresses the contributions of the Bartons. Here's to them! (P.S. I'm joking of course. I just find it weird that Amazon's computer is clearly set up to list the actors alphabetically, and so weirdly ""the Misfits"" is said to star James Barton. Amazon seems to correct this alphabetical default in some of their listing. And Monroe, Gable, Wallach, clift and the wonderful Thelma Ritter are very memorable in this movie.)"
3,Rookie Blue - Every Man,"Warning: Some spoilers will be discussed.Every Man wasn't a bad episode, it just wasn't my favorite. Why? Probably because I like a more integrated episode that shows the more seasoned cops (Oliver, Sam and Noelle) along with the rookies and this episode was pretty much all Rookies. Having said that, I did enjoy the friendship/partnership (but please, no romance EVER) between Andy & Nick. I liked that Gayle put herself on the line for the rest of the rookies. I liked Chris being thrown by his past showing up but also being a man about it. The concept of looking at a scene from 4 different angles is an interesting idea but it is not a new idea and it has been done better by other shows. I think it was simply because the scenes that they chose to be shown from 4 different angles...just weren't that interesting. So while there were good moments in the episode, it wasn't one that I will watch over and over as I have done with most of Rookie Blue's episodes."
3,"Fast shipping, ding on item",Shipping was fast but there was a ding on the corner of the case. I didn't want to wait for another one so I just bent the cover back and am using it as is. Still a disappointment to get a dinged case.
3,"Good, but not great","I have a few DVD from this AV studio. Altho this is not there strongest DVD, it is still good. Visuals are very good. The music is just ok. This is a good DVD to use at a party or if your a DJ. Over all good DVD. (c="
2,Dated,"Don't remember getting grabbed by this one, and it's not current. word word word w o r d w o r d"
4,Poems from the Like Free Zone CD,"Taylor Mali's CD of spoken poetry ""Poems from the Like Free Zone"" is a wonderful addition to any teacher's library. Honest without being pretentious, Taylor Mali is the champion of the understatement that says so much. Some cursing on a few tracks. Preview before letting little ears listen."
5,Pierre,"The book was in the exact condition the seller said it would be and that is all I expected so, I have to rate it 5 stars to the seller also it is a very good book for parents and children that are not always in the best of moods . Life is messy and its nice to know its messy for everyone . CARE"
5,Children I teach love this book!,"I have used this book with my classes for eight years. I used to teach kindergarten, and the children loved the song, and to turn the pages with the tape. Now I teach second grade at a new school and the children had never heard it before. It is now one of their favoites. We are now making ""Yes indeed I care!"" our class' motto. I have had as many as 12 copies of this at one time. They disappear, wonder why? :-)"
4,beautiful arms,"I love this work out, it is not easy, but its not so hard that you will never want to play it again. I do it every other day. This work out targets every area of the arm, but most of the work out focuses on shoulder definition. My problem area (the back of the arms) recieves the least amount of attention in this work out but in order to compensate for this I just pause the DVD and redo the reps twice before I move on. I was amazed at how quickly I noticed results."
2,OK Workout - Annoying Host,"The actual workout is a nice subsitute for when I can't make it to the gym for my normal arm routine. With a moderate weight I am happy with the tone and am not building too much muscle. I would probably use the workout more if I didn't find the host so obnoxious, with all his comments directed toward the ladies. When I ordered the DVD I was hoping the host would have a similar tone as the guy on the ""Look Great Naked"" series, with encouragement geared towards the average woman's workout goals without sounding condensending."
2,Left a bit to be desired,"Although I am new to yoga I have done some and I was expecting more from this video. The background were sotthing and the music was relaxing but the yoga poses were too few. I don't feel like I have fully stretchecd. I also didn't like the EXTENDED visualization. You lie on your side for close to 15 minutes ""relaxing to music"" Over all I am very disapointed in the video. I guess if you are doing nothing at all it may be a good start. I did alot of research before buying this video and unfortunatly there dosn't seem to be too much out there in the way of yoga for pregnancy."
1,Disappointed!,Awful service! I'm still waiting for the book to arrive! How can I follow-up to find out the status of my order?
4,Very interesting and very informative,"An excellent overview of key issues in the philosophies of science and religion, as well as the (exceedingly tedious) debate between evolutionists and creationists. Though the syntax is sometimes a bit sloppy and the prose a tad awkward, the content is damned near superb. A first-rate book by a first-rate scientist (and philosopher-in-training), and one hell of a nice guy. :)ALSO RECOMMENDED: Michael Shermer's WHY PEOPLE BELIEVE WEIRD THINGS and HOW WE BELIEVE: THE SEARCH FOR GOD IN AN AGE OF SCIENCE."
2,Dino movie,"I did not like the first part of this DVD. In the first chapter of the movie the young girl is very upset with island life. To express her dissatisfaction the young girl uses the word stupid over and over again. Stupid bird, stupid Island etc. I would have liked it better if the movie had used another way of expressing her unhappiness. I do not want my two and three year old thinking that is an acceptable way to express themselves. I skip over the first chapter when showing the movie."
3,"Lack of spark, bad ending","This movie disappointed me. The performances of all involved were EXCELLENT. But the screenplay was awful. Charlotte should have ended up with the pilot, Peter Gregory, and if not, they should have left him dead. Very sad indeed.There was not enough chemistry or building of a relationship to believe for a minute that she'd go all the way back to be with the French resistance fighter. Especially when she lets him flee alone without her and she returns to London.Flawed story, poor plot. I was very disappointed in the story."
3,Better than expected,"This film was better than I expected. The story is interesting, not totally implausible, and the fact that the film was shot in France adds a lot to the overall quality of the movie. CB is good as usual. Ending is fairly predictable though..."
3,A Different Kind of Novel,"This particular novel is one that most readers will find to be much different than other novels. Unlike most novels, After the Bombs is written in a different fashion. That is, Arturo Arias has constructed the novel to reflect a poetic-type construction; consisting of fragmented sentences and stanza-like paragraphing. However, this novel is easy reading in the sense that the actual content of the novel is largely in laymen terms although following the narration of the novel can prove to be a somewhat difficult task. Within the context of the novel one will find an extremely insightful and exciting adventure into an individual's life whom endured the political unrest of the 1950's revolution in Guatemala."
4,A lot better!,"I saw Emaneht live a year ago and bought a promo CD. I was totally stoked to see a new CD out, and after purchasing it, I'm not dissapointed. It's very upbeat with a sort of pop-rock sound. With lots of good songs and awesome guitars and vocals to back them up, it's a really good CD."
5,Superb!,"It is an extremely wonderful game but they have a few problems sometimes, like getting ""illegal operation"" messages... I've tried it on several computers. But it's still an excellent game and I recommend it, for a cheap price of only 9.99... it's a great deal! ~ SnowEater11, Weymouth MA"
2,Writing vs Acting,"Stay with what you know, Gene. Good storyline, but not a well-written novel. Skin-deep characterization. In witnessing his parent's violent deaths: 'It was his father. Dead''He saw in her eyes what could only be triumph. Triumph and love.' Ye Gods, man, the woman just had her throat cut! Come on, you're speaking of the violent deaths of loved parents, not what you had for breakfast.Gene, all your acting roles were great. Be content with that, and leave the writing to professionals.I note that the book was not published by a big name firm. That should give a buyer pause."
2,A poorly written book,"Hackman is fine in movies but he stall out in print. I write, too, and his writing is like mine---very bad. Excessive detail. A story starting in the States, jumps to Cuba, then the Pacific Island. On to another jump. The structure appears to be written by a child."
2,Not worth the money!,"I have read several adventure books, but this one let me down.It didn't keep my interest and it took me months to read it on and off. Specifically, the main character was hard to believe. He starts out as a naive 17 year old young man, and one year later he becomes worldly, and a man that everyone looks to for answers. Also, some of the writing was canned and a little corny, which some of the others have alluded to. Granted, I'm not the best writer, but if I buy a book I expect to read something better that I can write.I would have quit reading it a long time ago, but spending 20+ dollars for a book makes me feel guilty if I don't finish it. It wasn't terrible, and had its moments, but just not a page turner like some of the reviewers have stated. Everyone has their own opinion, but I would save my money and try to get it from a library if you are really interested."
2,The Way It Used to Be But Really Wasn't,"Once uopn a time this is the way baseball history used to be written: Take one old sportswriter, slap together some anecdotes, attack your enemies, protect your friends, kiss the rear ends of the powerful, call it history. Fortunately, we're all much wiser now. So much of Lieb's work has been disproven that books like these really deserve to be considered works of fiction. Interesting as a historical document, but useless as history. Absolutely everything covered by this book has been covered much much better elsewhere."
3,This SACD is in stero format,"I didn't actually remove the wrapping from this SACD and have not heard the music, so my star rating is irrelevant. I just wanted to let folks know that this SACD is in stereo format ... which is disappointing. Amazon needs to label SACDs more clearly in this regard. In addition, it would help if there was some easy way to search Amazon products for SACDs and DVD-Audio discs."
5,AMAZING!,"this book was amazing, usally in a last book of the series you would expect a cliff hanger at the end or a bunch of unanswered questions, but the end was awesome. all my questions were answered and i couldnt be more happy about how things ended up! im so sad i dont have another mediator book to read after this one.this book in the mediator series is about suze and how she figures out how to travel through time..... but paul figured out before her. hes plaing to stop jesse from ever being murdered... so that way suze and jesse will never meet! will suze let jesse live the life he deserved, or keep him as a ghost forever?"
2,Received Broke,"I would have still returned this if even if it hadn't have been broken. The picture made it look a lot bigger than it was. I should have payed closer attention to the measurements. I was surprised that it was so heavy and thick. The surface was a little lumpy as well, as if it was hand-made."
1,Terrible waste of time,"This book was terrible. Seriously one of the worst books I've ever read. Don't waste your time. Instead, read Nights in Rodanthe."
2,Did I miss something?,"I finished this book over a month ago and I'm still waiting for something to happen. Maybe I was expecting too much or at least something different, but I could tell the story in a couple sentences.There were plot twists that went nowhere and characters that were superfluous. I guess if you are into soap operas, this would be a good book. I hope you have better luck with it than I."
5,Unexpected twist that only Sparks can work.,"An amazing love story that shows the positive, lovely sides of love and also shows the doubts and struggles. It was such an amazing story that makes one appreciate what they have. Must read, tear jerker, my favorite book."
1,Why Have I been asked to review??,"I don't know why I have been asked to review this book, because it was missing 40 pages in the middle of the book. I have repeatedly asked Amazon to replace this book so I could finish it, and will happily send them the defective copy... Amazon tells me that it is unavailable...but they still show it listed for sale. They bought my book at a bargain price, and now wont stand behind their product. The first part of the book was good....but I wouldn't take a chance on buying it from Amazon if you want to read the entire book."
1,"Awful, Awful, Awful!!!!","I had read two other Sparks books prior to this one, so I knew what to expect (predictable, love story). The writing style annoyed me to no end. I could only get halfway through before I gave up. Mr. Sparks, stop TELLING me what your characters are feeling, experiencing. SHOW me!!!!Jeremy Marsh has to be the most annoying literary character I have ever discovered. Grow a pair and stop whining! Do not get me started on the stereotypical Lexie and Doris. YUCK!!!! Do not waste your time. I am finally giving up on Nicholas Sparks."
2,Is this what America reads?,"This is my first forray into this authors' work and, for me, the ""Sparks"" just didn't fly. I'm sure this is by design, but the reading level within is hovering at about the 5th grade standard. Said attribute is especially disconcerting because one of the main characters is a writer yet lacks any discernable command of English. I felt the dialogue was extemely mundane in a scenario where I felt- even assuming the 5th grade formula were in place- the author had opportunity. The Doris character could have been far more colorful and I was never convinced a writer was ever part of any conversation. Both the punctuation and sentence structure are excellent!"
1,Malevolence Wins the Day,"Unlike The Notebook, which is a beautiful love story, this story gets you hooked by pretending it shares the same benevolent, happy sense of life as that book--and then bashes you in the face with a tragic and totally arbitrary ending. I have never been so disappointed or felt so betrayed. Unless you enjoy tragedy, I recommend skipping this book entirely. If the author has now turned malevolent, check out any further books by Sparks before you buy them."
4,At First Sight (Jeremy Marsh),Love this author any book by them is a good read ! Expect new titles for future reads can' t get enough.
2,Hardback didn't come with paper cover,"I received the book within about a week, which was expected based on my shipping choice and since it was around Christmas. The book itself was in good condition, but there was no paper cover included. Since the book was advertised as ""like-new,"" I expected to have everything included, not the least of which would be a paper cover for a hardback book."
1,Glad I borrowed it from the library.......,Glad I didn't waste any money on this book. I love Nicholas Sparks and was very disappointed with this book. Not worthy of purchasing. Just go to your local library
2,"Love Nicholas Sparks, but needs to eliminate Femal Character","I really like Nicholas Sparks books, and this one was pretty good, If you are gonna read it, read True Believer first this book is an extension of that story. I liked this book except i could not stand the lead female character Lexie in this book. It kind of bothers me that even when she's in the wrong ( which she is a lot in the book), the male charcater, Jemermy ( who's point of view we read it in) always end up apoligizing even though Lexie's the one being a jerk. I see that a lot in his books, the girls are always right even when they're wrong they always end up flipping it around. It's just worse in this book than the others. It got a little annoying, but other than that it was a good book, I loved the ending. I would suggest it."
4,Good Stomp Box,I do like the fact that it's two in one but it would be nice to be able to run both effects at the same time but that doesn't come up too often. I like the Flanger better than the chorus but they both sound good enough for most live applications but nothing that stands out more than an any average Chorus or Flanger.
2,not enough detail to get the job done.,"One of the few videos I could find, it tends to speed through many of the most difficult cuts, and ignores many altogether."
5,Find a Copy!,"This is a treasure. It helps one sort out one of the oft-quoted critiques of the OT: ""It's violent, whereas the NT is love. There is all that war and God telling His people Israel to wage war and take actual, physical lives.Craigie aptly and ably shows the theme throughout the Scriptures of Yahweh Sabaoth, the Ultimate Warrior, and the carryover to the new.There are just outstanding conclusions here, e.g. ""War is a large-scale manifestation of the nature of man."" ""God has participated in warfare towards the ends of both judgment and redemption.""Gems to be gleaned from this work, some of which may also be found in his commentary on Deuteronomy."
3,Does not keep it's edge.,"I had this model about 10 years ago. that was stolen by a friend.that knife never seemed to lose it's edge, but when I got this one about 6 months ago about 2 weeks of light usage, the blade was already worn down.I would have recommended this more, it still cuts but just not as sharp."
3,Solid DVD from Enslaved!,"What can i say as far as the music performed on this DVD of course is awesome. I think it will satisfy any true enslaved fan. The overall quality of the DVD is acceptable but not the greatest. Still a great DVD has a couple of music videos included, interviews and behind the scenes tour documentary. Really good DVD to own no complaints really."
3,75th Anniversay ISP Yearbook,"The 75th Anniversay Illinois State Police yearbook documents the history of the agency along with photos of all currently serving (as of 1997) troopers, agents and employees grouped by district, zone and area of assignement. Retirees are listed in the rear of the yearbook. The 75th anniversay yearbook will be most interesting to currently serving troopers, retirees, family members and police historians interested in the evolution of the State Police and to track the careers of the sworn officers. The book contains a series of black and white photos that provide a historical review of the uniforms, cars, and headquarters used over the years by the Illinois State Police. A 1972 yearbook was also produced that is excellent when reviewed in conjunction with this 75th Anniversary book."
5,I never tire of this artist,"""...The depth and subtlety of the lyrics means that the music becomes richer with repeated listening.The music shifts smoothly between sounds subtly enough to add variety rather than break the flow. This a deep album that will leave you feeling enriched on a number of levels."""
2,Good songs but CD production values are disappointing,"This four disc set contains many songs from the American song book which are enjoyable to listen to.They are all sung by well known singers but in some cases not the singers who made the songs famous. For example ""What a Difference a Day Makes"" is sung by Sarah Vaughan instead of Dinah Washington. If you already have the Washington version then you may be happy to try something different.This four disc set contains no notes about the music, just the song titles and artists names.On the set that I received there is a problem with disc 4 which contains the songs for disc 3 instead of disc 4."
4,A Laugh On Every Page!,"Not all women may be predatory, BUT this book will help a guy identify those that are predatory. Women that find this book offensive, do so because they see themselves within these pages!"
3,A woman's thoughts,"I read this book out of curiosity and ended up enjoying the humorous writing style of the author. Maybe readers should do the same and read this book for the humor and not use it as a guidebook on how to deal females. Yes, the author is a pilot (and no, he probably never spent *millions* on his one and only divorce). This book lacks 'expertise' and it shouldn't be taken as seriously as some of the male and female reviewers seem to have done. It was written by a man who went through a nasty divorce--like a lot of us. Just read it for the laughs but don't put any more stock in it than you would a how-to handbook on flying written by a shrink who flew a plane once in his life. And guys if you choose to be with the right woman for the right reasons, you shouldn't have to look at her as the enemy. Most of us are pretty decent and don't want the PIN for your ATM card. <g>"
4,"Bitter, but with just cause.","(...). But his bottom line is right on. The overwhelming move Western society is taking towards a gynarchy is disturbing. Men are loosing value a rapid pace. Read the personal ads by women and most note that they don't need a man, it would just be fun to have one around. The author obviously resonates a chord with other men, based on the reviews here. This book is being passed around my worksite now. The only one who didn't relate to it was a homosexual. All the others recognized the signs, symptoms and results of trusting the fairer sex. A quick and insightful read. Warning: it will make you angry at yourself for being duped. Unfortunately, I don't think me get it until after they've been had."
3,the cases were all broken,"the cds are alright but the cases are poor quality, when i received the cds, the cases were all broken"
1,bring the excitement of doctors' offices to your own home,"Does your child have too many brain cells? Want to condition your child for a lifetime of elevator music? Do you find syncopation and too many 8th-notes far too stimulating for your little one? The twins provide you with hours of music to cure all your woes. Here are 102 of your previously favorite songs, sung in a choral style to ensure a uniform, bland vocal noise rendering the lyrics indistinct. Accompanying the vocals are the synthesizer-generated instruments with spashes of musak-inspired jazz. In this way, the eyes are sure to glaze over and zombie-like behavior can be attained in record time."
5,We really enjoy this!,"I like to play these CD's as ""background"" music while the kids (2-years & 6 months) and I are playing; the music is cute and cannot be considered ""annoying"" as most children's music is. It's good for kiddies AND mommies!!"
1,The Constitution in Exile,"Could not finish the book. I think it was not only biased with too much of his personal feelings, but written in a way that was very uninteresting for the reader. Got the book based on his appearances on the Oreilly Factor but was very disappointed. If you are a moderate conservative like most Americans you probably will not like this nor his interpretation of the constitution."
3,good book,Good book but I can't get over how similar all his law books are. All the author does is list case after case then writes in a sentence or two about how outrageous it is that our rights are being taken away. Half way through reading the book it can be a chore to get through the rest of the cases.
3,artful,"Even though the story was very simple and straightforward and ordinary, I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed the book. the author writes masterfully."
2,"Could Have Been Better-I Give it a ""C-""","This book just seemed incomplete and not put together too well.It starts out with Ruby, Jack's late wife dying of lung cancer, and how he is grieving for her. Then it goes into the real story before this happened, Ruby having overprotective parents, and yet she goes off and marries an abusive husband. Jack is lonely and loves Ruby the first time he sets eyes on her. So when Ruby's unfaithful/abusive husband John dies from an accident, the two get together and marry. They share a few happy years together until Ruby comes down with lung cancer, and dies. Jack is so grief-stricken, he cannot move on with his life, and the book continues that way at the end more or less.I wouldn't waste my time reading this book when there is much better reading material."
2,Simplistic and monotonous,"Although a short book, ""A Virtuous Woman"" kept me occupied for a while mainly because I had to persevere to finish it. I never did finish it as boredom prevented me from doing so. The linguistic style was very colourful although it became rather irritating after a while. This of course may be because I know very little of the culture of the southern United States and thus found it difficult to empathise with the characters. However, I found it depressing and lacking in depth and had to resign myself to the fact that I was never going to finish it."
3,Just kind of ok...,The story was fine and it was a quick read with some interesting moments but overall I would not recommend this book unless you just need something to read on a quick flight. I really don't understand what all the fuss is about. I believe if you go into this book thinking it's some amazing novel you will be disappointed. But if you are looking for something light to read without becoming engrossed you will be fine. I certainly wouldn't call this a page turner and have a whole list of books I would recommend before this one.
2,A Virtuous woman,I really did not care for this book very much at all. I found it to be pointless. It is a quick read but at the end of the day what was the point? I am not sure. I did not connect with the characters and when it it all said and done felt like who cares???
4,"Sad, but Sweet","A Virtuous Woman is a quick read about the love between Ruby and Jack, with each telling his/her story through alternating chapters. Often, I feel like a book is longer than necessary, but with this one, I found myself wanting more details about Ruby and Jack's relationship and what it was like for them to face Ruby's terminal diagnosis together. It was a sweet book about two individuals who fit together and met one another's needs while not sacrificing who they were as individuals. It is not a love story infiltrated with passion, but one that left me feeling appreciative of those unspoken quieter moments that define a comfortable, yet special and timeless romance."
4,"To the moralizing ""ladies"" that gave comments...","I was disturbed to read reviews trashing this book as ""false"" feminism or an ""encouragement"" of violence. Please. Stange has written an interesting and scholarly account of how women throughout the ages have hunted and continue to hunt. She contributes to research that proves women can be as powerful and complex in their behavior as men. Women hunt, they work as police, they become soldiers, they kill their attackers. Which leads to the conclusion (gasp!), women are people too. For the ""real"" feminists who think ending patriarchy is about fainting in horror at violence in general, thereby washing their hands of men's and women's actual behavior, I say, ""grow up."" Stange helps make the point that these issues are complicated, and she joins other feminist voices in illustrating that women can be every bit as noble, savage, courageous, and dangerous as men. Some women have just bought the claptrap telling them they shouldn't be."
5,The Mayo Clinic Williams-Sonoma Cookbook,"This became my 84th cookbook two months ago and is already my most used one. I picked it up in a store and could not put it down. The full color photographs of each recipe are very appealing, and each recipe I have tried has turned out delicious and looks exactly like the picture. The recipes are fairly quick and uncomplicated to prepare. The directions are clear and easy to follow. There are Cooking Clinic and Nutrition Note sidebars to help one learn as you go. My husband (a meat and potato man) and I are learning to eat healthier and this book makes it very easy with fabulous recipes like Mustard greens and macaroni, Provencal chicken and fennel, Rosemary lamb and white beans, and Teriyaki vegetable and beef kabobs. We have also loved the vegetable dishes we have tried; Herbed carrot and beet salad, Tender spring peas and asparagus, and Sweet potato casserole. There is even a recipe for Chocolate pudding pie, so eating well is easy with this cookbook!"
1,Sizing not close,this item was waaaayyy small even though marked as correct size. returned and never did see credit. dont waste your money.
5,Essential item,"Book had a few folded corners, but other than that was in great condition. Just what was needed."
5,Great Book,"Upon my interest of the civilization of D'ni, and Riven, I craved for more information, wanting to know so much more about D'ni, it's cluture, background, and structure. So, I ordered this book, and got more than I hopped for. It was exactly what I was looking for. I believe the order in which the books are placed is perfect and I reccomend this book to anyone, adults and children, who likes a good read that keeps you turning pages. If your interested in D'ni, and want to know more, this is the book for you. I can't wait for The Book of Marrim."
5,Attention History Buffs!,This DVD is a must own for History lovers. Walter Cronkite cronicles his lifetime of history and career. His reporting is so insightful and includes actual footage of events. The review helped me to understand the flow of life's patterns through my parents lives and most of mine. It is an important set to have in anyone's library.
5,One of my ALL-TIME favorite Cds.,"I have owned this CD for about 6 years now, and it is still on my playlist. Everytime I clean house, this is the CD I put in. Excellent. I wish he would make another CD. QT has the BEST taste in music."

3,Enjoyable Read,"Web of Evil is the first book I've read by J. A. Jance and I intend to read more by this author. Web of Evil was a very thrilling, suspenseful read. I've noticed other reviews that classify the book as ""Hokey"" but I thoroughly enjoyed reading of Ali's adventures."
4,good but not great,This is teh secind book in hte series of Ali Reynolds. As usual Jance has drawn her characters really well. They are interesting and you care about them. She has some recurring charaters too.I am interested to see where they all go.The story was too similar to the first one. I am not sure what to make of hte job as a blog reporter? Does that exist?It took a few books for JP Beaumont to hit his stide so I am willing to give this another go.The Joanna Brady books are the best. Not to be missed.
3,Good read,"Good continuation of the characters. Definitely guessed the end, but as usual the writing was great. I'm more of a Beaumont fan, but this character is keeping my interest."
2,Not working correctly,"Have had this product for only a month and have used it four times. I use it only on a flat surface and in a straight line from one side of my back yard to the other side. If I read the information provided with the product correctly, it has a high setting that is supposed to move at ~40' per hour and a low that is supposed to move at ~20' per hour. The first time I used it, it seemed to work fine but then it slowed down dramatically on the second use and is now very slow. On the high setting it now takes the unit I purchased ~7 hours to go 75'(~11 feet per hour). During the last use I heard a clicking sound from the unit as it moves (barely). I do not recall if it made this same sound the first three times I used it, but I believe there is a problem. I have neighbors that have this unit and have had no problems, so I believe it is just a defective unit. I will contact Nelson to return and replace it."
3,A little on the slow side,"I need to check the connections and pressure still, but having set everything up last night for the first time, I was dissapointed at the slow speed of the unit. I even adjusted the arms to maximize speed, but it was still crawling. Pools of water were forming in its path so I'm not sure if I'll be able to continue using it unless I can figure out how to speed it up."
1,awful,"not operating as it should. I've had it on a shorter hose than allowed, yet, the tractor just stops in the middle of the yard, and I've had 2 months of very water bills, because, I guess, I thought I'd leave it alone at night, and it would stop by itself...wrong...had a John Deere one, twice as much, but 3 times better...I should have kept it, instead of going for the cheapo :("
2,Save you receipt!!!,"I sent mine back on the second day... It pulled less than 70 ft (in 2 seperate pulls) then the gear box started skipping. $8 to ship it back to the Peoria IL repair center. Repiars were quicker than the 4 to 6 weeks stated in the returns paperwork. When I called the repair center in the second week they said ""Hold onto your receipt"". The warranty period is two (2) years. I'm guessing I'll need it again."
5,One heck of a sprinkler,"If you have an odd shaped yard or a lot of area to cover this sprinkler works great. It is quite durable, and not too hard to find replacement parts.Cons:1. You may have to baby sit it until you get the feel for how to lay out your water hose.2. If it gets off track and runs into something, the gears in the drive train can get stripped or break. You have to buy the whole drive train assembly to repair.Pros:1. Very durable2. You can cover a wide variety of terrain, by adjusting the angle of the arms.3. Its cool."
1,Disappointed,"I was VERY disappointed with the Nelson 1865 Raintrain. Every one I know that has one of these has nothing but good things to say about them. For myself, the second time I used it I noticed it was clicking and it would go forward and then fall backward. It was literally taking 2 steps forward and 1 step back. Hopefully this was just the one bad one of the lot. I do apprciate amazon.com having an easy to execute exchange policy. I am just hoping I will get my $17.80 back for shipping this product back to them. If not, I won't be back. If yes, I will be back."
4,Great Time saver!,"I bought this when we re-seeded the lawn and I didn't have time to go move the sprinkler since I had my son less than a week earlier.The ""tractor"" as my 3 year old calls it has been a life saver. Our lawn looks great thanks to the 3 water settings!Like others have said, it takes a bit to get the hose set up correctly and we had multiple times where the wheels got stuck in the mud and dug some holes, but overall, I am very happy with this product."
2,"Not ""All That""","THe thing worked only a short time per attempt before it went off the track or the sprinkler arms blew off from the water pressure. Can't turn up the water pressure above half on without a ""blow out"" occuring. Got tired of fooling with the darn thing and sold it on e-bay. I lost a little money but at least the old-fashined oscillating sprinker worked and worked very well. I would not recommend this sprinkler to anyone."
1,NOT MADE IN USA ANYMORE!,"i specifically bought this sprinkler because the description above clearly stated that it was made in the USA. however, the sprinkler that arrived was made in CHINA, not the USA.thanks a lot, nelson, for betraying your customers and your American employees."
2,Less than Satisfied,"I bought this item because of its reputation. At first I was very pleased with the item, it was making laps around the yard, and seemed to be doing great. So one night I drug my hose around, and made my nice track, and put the shutoff about 15 ft from the end of the hose. Well, I got up the next morning, and it was still going. It had come off the track, and had run into the flowerbed. Needless to say it was stuck. Just so you know I was using a 5/8"" heavy duty hose, so I really wouldn't think it would jump off track. Now the gears are stripped and I had to order a new motor from Nelson. Cost me $23 for a new motor. Oh and did I mention this was only 2 weeks after I purchased the product. I love the product, and the concept just hate the plastic gears!"
4,Works as promised...,"The wheels tend to get bogged down in wet dirt, so if your lawn isn't established, this might not be the sprinkler for you, but other than that, it works as advertised."
2,Nelson 1865 traveling sprinkler,"I own three LR Nelson Traveling Sprinklers! Two speed and a neutral positions. Says that it drags 200' foot of hose!The traveling sprinkler is a great concept. However, ""They just don't make 'em like the used to.""The gear box has failed in all three within a seasons time. Just be prepared to buy a new one every 2 months and 'Happy Watering!'"
2,not exactly as promised,None of the descriptions of this product mentioned that it doesn't work on new lawns- just the instructions after I bought it- it gets boggged down in the wet dirt and runs off the hose easily- I will try again once I establish the grass but so far I am disappointed.
1,Cheap plastic broke after 1 week,"I bought this because of all the good reviews here on Amazon. It worked great for 1 week. Then it started leaking a huge amount of water out the bottom and didn't have enough pressure coming out the sprayer to keep it going.I took it apart to try and find the problem. I was surprised that only the front body of the sprinkler is metal. The entire rear assembly, including the housing, wheels, gears, and all internal parts are made from cheap plastic. The molded housing that connects the water from the hose coupling (on the outside) to the sprayer (on the inside) had cracked and split, allowing the water to leak out inside the sprinkler.It was apparent from the damage that the housing had cracked from some force on the hose coupling. I have been very gentle with this sprinkler, and not abused it, or torqued it by the hose. Most likely it was from the force of dragging the 100' hose around, which is what it's supposed to do."
2,TO LITE TO STAY ON TRACK,"My sprinkler was purchased from Amazo.comThis is my third Walking Sprinkler. The last two I had were Nelson and I wore them out.The new model is different in many ways. IIt has a ""motor"" that drive the sprinkler, both other ones hadstops on each wheel that drove them. They also had metal, not plastic drive and guide wheels. These plastic wheel are the problem. The sprinkler is not heavy enough too stay on track. It will jump the hose, even on a straight run, and go off track.Having known this I would not have purchased this item. Another brand would be better, I'm sure.GDYURK"
2,Good product but with defects,"I have just purchased my second Nelson Traveling Tractor. The first broke after about two years. It was a great labor saving product for getting water to the entire front yard without constantly moving the sprinkler. But now, the second is broke after only two months. The plastic materials are not designed to sustain a very long life. The sprinkler obviously has some cheap plastic parts. Do not spend a lot of money for this product."
3,Troubles with sprinkler,"It works well (great watering area), I have had trouble making it go up an incline though."
1,Disgusted!!,"VERY Unhappy. This sprinkler is a joke. I have had these for years; and this one DOES NOT MOVE. The post office will not accept this as I have opened the box, Well, yea, and so I am out the money I wasted on this product from Amazon. So disgusted."
4,great comedy,THE IN LAWS IS ONE OF THE ALL TIME GREAT COMEDIES WITH A PERFECT TEAM UP OF PETER FALK AND ALAN ARKIN. SOMETIMES THE BEST MOVIES DO NOT HAVE TO HAVE THE MOST FAMOUS CAST AND BIGGEST NAMES IN HOLLYWOOD TO GIVE US A MOVIE THAT KEEPS YOU LAUGHING FROM START TO FINISH. PETER FALK HAS BEEN IN SOME OF MY FAVORITE ALL TIME COMEDIES LIKE THE BRINKS JOB AND MURDER BY DEATH AND ALAN ARKIN ALWAYS BRINGS SOMETHING TO THE TABLE JUST CHECK OUT LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE OR THE NEW GET SMART MOVIE HE STEALS EVERY SCENE HE IS IN.
1,Maybe funny in the ice age,"Maybe this film was really funny 30 years ago, but no offense it's no funny at all in this century. I watched this film thinking it was good since it had so many positive reviews, but I'm very disappointed. Worst in-laws film, at least by today standards it's terrible. I'm 32 years old (maybe the other reviewers are from another generation??), but this is awful. People of my age and younger, don't waste your time with this."
5,one of the best comedies ever made,"I have seen this movie many times and I enjoy it every time. It is truly one of the best written, funniest comedies of all time. Peter Falk is a comedic genius."
2,"Good overview, But not useful for SAP ESS developers","If you want to understand, what is ESS, how it works, its overview and architecture. Then this is the book for you. But if you want to develop and implement ESS applications this is not the book for you. Instead you can refer online documentation. As a developer you need better knowledge of BHTML and Java script and how they interact with R/3 applications like transactions and RFCs. I don't suggest this book for you. Unfortunately no book is available currently for developers except bits and pieces of information in SAP online documentation for this purpose. So best of luck in doing experiments with R/3 ESS. Thanks"
5,Best Soul/Jazz album of 2002. Period !,"'THIS IS REGINA' is a 'must have' for anyone looking for something a little deeper than the pop [stuff] which is around now...I first met (virtually)Regina Belle through the wonderful 'tribute' album 'TO GROVER,WITH LOVE',where she does mellow,soulful justice to the classic 'Just the two of us',which was a monster hit for Washington and Bill Withers back in 1981.She is absolutely fantastic !Ms.Belle's latest release is an addictive,catchy collection of twelve great songs,expertly perfomed - who could ask for anything more?Listen,you should better buy the... two above mentioned albums!You will never thank me enough !"
5,"Honest and highly skilled vocalist,maybe the best .","Everythig has already been said and written..What can I add ?No question about one of the best vocalists on the planet.I love this CD which has captured my attention since the first listening one year ago.""This is Regina"" is the ideal accompaniment to a quiet romantic evening by the fireside with a loved one.Twelve great songs sung impeccably with her peerless voice and class.Buy it and enjoy it."
3,GREAT VOICE..... BAD MATERIAL,"I am one of Regina's biggest fans I have everyone of here albums but lately she has been going to different record company's lately. The voice is still there but the material she chooses to sing is not good. It does not do anything for her voice is just ordinary.... How bout some production from Diane Warren, with Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. Just to name a few. Lets try something new here Regina.... or your albums are gonna continue to be in the used bin at the stores. But never the less I will continue to by your cd's cause you will always have atleast one cut on there that you may decide to cut up on..... I think the last challenging song for your voice was A whole new world. Amaze me next time Regina..... I have faith in you"
5,...revitalising the old school ballads wonderfully...,"More popular than ever,Regina is finally recognized as one of the leading purveyors of Soul/Jazz.I am so glad to read all the customer reviews about her latest release ! And there's plenty ! Which does mean a thing!Already a number one in the pop charts,this sixth solo offering from the heavenly song-stylist brings her huge talent for revitalising and reinterpreting the old school ballads.'This is Regina' looks to cement her success in airplay,write-ups and charts and establish her as one of the most significantrecording artists of our days.You made it,Regina!"
5,Heavy duty humor !,"When I saw this movie, I lived in Atlanta. It ran there for well over a year, because the crowds were so good for it and returning to see it several times. Be ready for some slapstick visual comedy that really keeps your full attention. The first 10-15 or so minutes are slow and a sort of set-up for the rest, and you think you must be in the wrong movie, but then it goes into high gear and never stops. I laughed so hard my stomach hurt the next day. Some of the unusual things that happen in the movie you would never expect. There are scenes I will never forget. Not everybody enjoys it as much as I did, but if you're expecting sophistication, forget it! This is for those who like a good ""belly-laugh""."
5,Very funny,"If you see this dvd, you are crazy..because very very very funny!!!This dvd is EIGHT THUMPS UP!!...why?...my thumps,my wife thumps and daughters thumps."
5,Best comedy of all time,"I never understood how people could nominate their favourite movie of all time until I saw this.I suppose if you have got as far as reading this review you already know about the movie anyway!The scenes with the land rover ""the anti Christ"" and gate opening using the rock as a hand brake would prompt me into repeated laughter for the rest of my life if played in a loop.As a Spike Milligan, Monty Python etc fan I am not easily amused.There are several underlying thought provoking themes here that could occupy volumes, sociological imagination, the Nacirema concept and all that.Simply superb and superbly simple.Buy it with a money back guarantee from me. If you don't laugh heartily and repeatedly on watching it I will refund your expenses. If I fail to - sue me and on producing any snippet from the movie as evidence any court in the world will dismiss the case!!!!!"
5,Keystone Cops meets National Geographic - good description,"I won't add significantly to what has already been written about these movies. The budgets were not a gazillion dollars - and it shows, but there was some thought and heart that went into the productions - and THAT shows too.I've watched these movies several times in several different groups, and parts of them ALWAYS get big belly-laughs.The DVD transfers are quite adequate - High Definition Wide-Screen. I doubt these films could LOOK any better with the source material they had.Several reviewers remarked about their annoyance on the accompanying documentary that translation is not offered for the comments of Kalahari Bushman star N!xau. I was initially upset too, then I thought - ""hey, how about pushing the subtitle button on the remote"" - abracadabra!!! N!xau's enlightening words suddenly came with English subtitles!These films are little gems, and I'm always entertained watching them. Check it out - two films for the price of one!"
5,Best movie ever,"This is one of the funniest, most entertaining movies I have ever seen and I am surprised it is not better known. With four plots interwoven the story is a work of genius. I shall be sharing these discs with all my friends and family."
5,MEMORY RUSH:,"MY LATE FATHER LOVED WHEN I READ THIS BOOK TO HIM, OVER AND AGAIN, AND HE WOULD HAVE ME PAUSE EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE SO THAT HE COULD ADD HIS ""TWO-CENT'S WORTH"" BEST AS HE COULD REMEMBER IT. I LATER BOUGHT A SECOND COPY FOR ANOTHER ELDERLY GENT ... GOT THE SAME REACTION. IT WAS FUN TO WATCH THIS WONDERFUL LITTLE BOOK BE ABLE TO EVOKE A SHAKE OF THE HEAD OR JUST PURE AMUSEMENT EVERY TIME THE PASSAGES WERE READ."

1,Extremely Bad Projector Screen,"Do not buy! This screen is a travesty. It has a strong rubber smell. It does not retract, that is, if it is left hanging it will roll out by itself. It is of shoddy construction. The bottom of the screen has two endcaps that fell off in the natural course of trying to manuever the screen in my house. It is very heavy and large, making it difficult to return. It is not worth it at any price. Now I get to try to see if I can get Amazon to pay to ship it back! Wish me luck. Don't make the same mistake."
3,"The original was GREAT, but the US messed it up","Speaking about content, this movie is literally the best I haveever seen in my whole life. This includes anime and American movies.It is the most well-rounded film I've seen; the characters are great, the plot is stunning, and the movie stays with you long after you see it. If I were to rate the movie, I'd give it 1,000,000+ stars.However, the English dubbed voices, as usual, were terrible. The beautiful original japanese acting should never be destroyed so brutally. The fact that the acting in this movie brought my rating from 1,000,000 to 3 should show something. Releasing a movie on DVD gives the opportunity to present the movie in many languages, but this opportunity wasn't taken. This DVD not including a Japanese form is the very reason why I will not buy it, and one of the many reasons why I shun Disney."
5,This movie is beautiful!,"Three years were spent into making this. They were not wasted! This is simply the best animated film I've ever seen. I'm 14 years old, for those of you who don't already know, but this movie is one I'm not too young to review. The animation is spectacular; the Great Forest Spirit changing into the nightwalker is simply not to be believed! Everything is amazing. Princes Mononoke is gloroius, glamorous, and invigorating.Rated PG-13 for some intense sequences of animated violence and gore. Decapitations and mutilations are indeed present--maybe it should be pushed to an R. It may look like any kid's cartoon, but it's longer, bloodier, and a MILLION times better!"
3,okay,"The second half was Boorrring. Get Billy Bob's voice outta there two. Talk about miscast! The story had its momemts, but they were all in the first 40 minutes."
2,I wish I hadn't bought this,"I was intrigued by the effusive praise that so many ... heaped upon this movie, and I thought to myself ""Wow, this sounds incredible - I'd better check this out.""However, this film ...It's way, way too overlong. It comes in at about 2 hrs 20 mins, yet so much of the movie is painfully repetitious that this could easily have been trimmed to 80 mins. The American voice-overs are AWFUL. Minnie Driver is passable, but every other actor makes it sound like a school play. They're hammier than a side of pig. I can't believe anime has evolved so little since ""Akira""."
2,Definetly not as good as I expected...,"Princess Mononoke is a really popular movie... just see all the positive reviews about it! I rented this movie, then recieved it as a gift from a friend. The story itself is good... although, I was not very impressed and for me, it ""dragged"" alot. It is kinda scary for the younger ones I would say... and for me, it wasn't that great at all like I said. I rather not give the story away so I won't say to much but... I would not spend my money on it. I would buy it if I were you first... as with any movie, that is how personally I do it."
5,Like the movie gladiator except its anime! But BLOODY!,I Really ecomend this to any anime fan even though im only 11anywho I have only seen part of it it`s sad and violent.I realy recomend this to any anime fan.
2,just ok,"I loved Howls Moving Castle. Loved Spirited Away. Embraced Kikis Delivery Service, Arriety and the cat film that I cant think of. What happened here? I dunno just didnt care for it and therefore I wont be recommending it."
4,"A great anime, an average DVD","Please do not get carried away by the ""Star Wars"" reference on the box. This is NO STAR WARS. To the contrary is a more passive but epic masterpiece.The Japanese track was a great adition, you will notice how sub-par are the english voice-actors(even the Disney caliber ones) when compared to the original voices.But with that aside, this is still one of the best english dubbing efforts of all time! Great cast for a great anime classic!But the Dvd lacks a solid documentary about the process of uncovering this gem! WHy the Disney animators got interested in it? Why this movie took so long to get a theatrical release on the states? All this questions and more are left unanswered.But I guess I might be asking for much! Disney is not a great fan of the DVD format as a ""learning tool."" (They tend to used as a marketing ploy) In the end, the movie makes up for it and the Japanese track we fans pushed Disney to include, is a great satisfaction!"
4,VERY GOOD!!,"THIS WAS A GOOD MOVIE. I LOOOVVVEEE MIYAZAKI MOVIES!!!! IT WAS EVEN A LITTLE SCARIER THAN HIS OTHER MOVIES, BUT STILL HAD THE UNDERLYING NOTION OF GOOD VERSUS EVIL AND THE EVILS OF WAR AND NEED TO TAKE CARE OF OUR PLANET. I THINK HIS BEST IS HOWLS MOVING CASTLE. THIS IS PROBABLY HIS THIRD BEST MOVIE."
4,Princess Mononoke Review,"Princess Mononoke is a beautifully animated film about a young man inflicted with a deadly curse after touching then killing a god (a boar) who had been shot. He must then go in search of the forest god to lift this curse. While on his journey, he embarks on an epic battle between man and nature.While the animation and coloring is beautiful, there is an acting issue that I have, the casting of Billy Bob Thronton. Normally I wouldn't have a problem with him, but I could not displace his physical appearance with his character's although his performance is great.Overall, if you want to experience a monumental story with stunning animation this should be your first stop. It is lacking in the bonus feature area but does contain the original Japanese language track that was on my most wanted list. Definitely pick this up and you will not regret it."
3,"Great Movie, terrible waste of DVD",I can't understand how Disney isn't going to release this great movie with it's original language included as an option. One of the greatest features of a DVD is the possibility to change between languages and subtitles. They're just wasting a great DVD. Japanese animation rocks! but in japanese!
5,A very compelling and poweful story!,"As a fan of anime, I had read quite a few reviews on Princess Mononoke. I knew, before I even saw this film, that it would become one of my favourites if not my favourite.Well, I want you to know that this film exceeded all my expectations and then some, a powerful and gripping tale. This film, will leave you awestruck with its beautifully illustrated animation, very emotional story, and masterfully done music score. To quote an old commerical, ""It doesn't get any better than this."""
5,Superb!,"when i first saw all the previews for this i thought it was one of those freaky artsy anime movies. well i was really wrong!. i saw it on tv not too long ago and got hooked right away! i loved the story, characters and music! Better than crouching tiger hidden dragon! the american dubbed version features an all star cast including Claire Danes, Billy Bob Thorton, Gillian Anderson and Minnie Driver. Although many adults would look at this and say, ""its a cartoon so its a kid movie"" but they are very wrong. infact, this movie contains mature violence and adult language. this movie is aimed toward teenagers and older. well, to sum it up, this movie has a great plot, great cast, and wonderful music. You dont have to be an anime fan to enjoy this!"
4,Best Of Anime,"This movie its excellent, the animation rocks,and the sound is great too. It's a story about the war between men and nature; a prince and a savage girl."
5,Homage from James Cameron,"I just watched the DVD today, I probably not the first person to mentioned this, so here goes. 25 minutes into the movie, I said to myself, haven't I seen this movie like in the last 6 weeks, OH YEAH!!, It's AVATAR ! the story line, the characters, the overt themes, the forest background, the little faires. Enough said, I still enjoyed both films. By the way I just found out that James Cameron is a huge J-Anime fan. Thank you."
5,THE NOST MOVING MOVIE.,"""Oh my God"" This film is the most beautiful, emotionally moving film I have ever seen. Words do not begin to describe just how deeply this movie will emotionally cut you. You will laugh, and cry, experience shock and horror, and do it all through experiencing the magnificent characters. The literary themes of man v. nature man v. man, nature v. nature, and man v. self, are all laid out in a form worthy of a shakesperian play. The script was penned into english by Neil Gaiman, author of the sandman series of comics by D.C. This film is the most view-worthy film of the decade, and I would reccomend it to anyone. Everything from the Beautiful artwork, to the quiet characterization of characters like Yakul, Ashitaka's giant red elk. It is worth every penny and would be if it cost 1,000,000, dollars. Please watch this there are values in it that we can all benefit from.- Matthew Richard."
5,The Best Anime EVER,"if you do not own this, buy it, steal it, just get it.Mononoke Hime is one of those true classics, like Ghost in the Shell or Akira. The animation is absolutely beautiful and this is a movie that will stay with you forever. I personally have watched it over and over and I can't get enough of it.If you like a beautiful story, amazing animation and want to be entertained and challenged get this movie. I have yet to meet someone who does not like it. It's a true gem.AH (Illustrator)"
5,Great Movie,This is a stunning movie with extremely original ideas. Nothing like it has been made or introduced to the American market.
3,"Brilliantly produced, visually stunning pro-Eco propaganda","This is a brilliantly produced, visually stunning animation production which is at the same time an unapologetic eco-fascist tree-hugging paen to the evils of technology and the supposed purity and/or nobility of ""Nature"". The fact that so much technical virtuosity has gone into something like this reflects how completely we've, in our guilt about the supposed despoiling of nature, caved into the ideological agenda of the PC-police, eco-nazi division. Disgusting message, a ranting diatribe against progress and a hymn to a neo-fascism of anti-technological neo-paganistic recidivism. This stunning and no doubt important work is to eco-fascism what The Triumph of the Will is to Nazism."
3,srereotypical,"The main character in ""The Bridges of Madison County"" called himself the last cowboy. Perhaps that is where the author got her inspiration for the hero of this book. If your idea of a romantic male is one who speaks about how he is easy to love and hard to hold and compares women to fillies then this is your book. I found both books very disappointing because of the heros. This one has the improbable name of K.C., drawls his grammar, grins his ""darlin'""s likes to toss back a few brews, dance with the women folk and take a lazy smoke in the back yard. This is more western stereotype than western hero. The heroine's personality never came clear to me either. She was a social worker just shy of a PhD., yet I never felt her passion for the boys she supposedly wanted to help. The story was slow moving, involved the family but never really engaged me. I did like how the hero seemed to truly respect the heroine and finally realized how much he needed her as his center."
4,Love Everything this Author Writes,"The hero is fantastic. His personal journey to find himself and to reach a deeper relationship with a woman he is attracted to from the beginning is a bit unique. He's a drifter who's never asked much of himself, and it's interesting to see him step up to commitment and to stand up for what he knows is right. The romance is good, but so is the character development of the hero, and a little of the heroine. The wild horses are also spectacular. The story makes you want to be there. It makes you wish for wide open spaces and a lifestyle that only a few get to enjoy."
3,"Not a classic, but so what?","This is a book that, out of boredom, I reread after having not been impressed the first time around. While certainly not on the level of ""Dune,"" the novel nevertheless portrays a unique future (profit-driven, of course; move over, cyber-punks!). If you have a few carefree days to spend reading, you could do much worse."
4,Screen Protector works as expected,"The screen protector works as expected. My son had a hard time installing, so I had to remove it and re-apply it. But, it does work as it is expected to work."
5,love this phone!,"i recommend this phone to anyone!!!!the phone is great, but in order to enjoy it to its fullest:-buy expandable memory-get headphones-get some sort of case/cover-get a usb cable commectoru can get all of that extra stuff from amazon for around $15!!!this phone is amazing, has great speakers, lots of cool features, and an amazing camera! EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE THIS PHONE!!!"
1,white chocolate v cast,"lousy phone, when you turn on it starts going through all the available options for about 2 or 3 min. Then the voice commands do not work, it does seem to understand what i am telling it to do even after I programed it to. It does not pull number correctly. The circle direction option is also lousy the direction keys, option keys and the okay button do work like it, made to do. Dont purchase this one."
3,what happened to the speaker phone?,"I got my phone a week ago and I have not run into any of the other problems (so far) folks seem to be having. Except for the speaker phone!!It is awful,it does not work.IMO the enV is not equipped with a speaker phone.For someone who dislikes head/ear phones/plugs and is accustomed to super clear speaker phones (think Razr) this is a problem. I am aware there has been some mention of it among the reviews but it did not come across as a particularly big issue which is why I didn't pay particular attention.Anyone know if the speaker phone works better on the orange enV?Thanks."
3,Why have this kind of phone with limited texting?,"I used this phone the other day, and it seems lovely. The keypad is easy to use, and the specs are great. Nice camera, nice sound, video a plus. I use T-Mobile and have a Sidekick III, and I'd have to say that I prefer the SKIII over this phone, because of ease-of-use and the interface.I guess my biggest question is why does Verizon have a phone like this when they have such a limited data plan? Don't they have a limit of 2000 texts a month? Or do they have another data service I don't know about? A web package perhaps?Seems like a waste :/"
5,A classic in classic format,I love this book. I haven't read these stories in a long time and forgot how wonderful they are. The book is nicely put together and it very complete. Glad I bought it.
2,Whats new?,"Yes, I am the one who ruined the five star rating. Why? It is simple. 1. It is not the worst cd i have ever heard, however, Garth offers nothing new in this album. He rehashes the same themes he has for his last couple albums. 2. Talent, the only talent he has is marketing his name, which i admit he is good at that. 3. This cd falls short of his better work (no fences, and the self titled album"
2,I could have done without this one,"I have been a Garth fan for a long time. I have just about all of his CD's, have seen him live, and look forward to his new releases. However, this one I could have done without. I think he is out of the groove or needs to create a new one. His work is drifting from the formula that made him a hit. This CD was very disappointing. There was nothing gripping about it. I particularly disliked Beer Run, an annoying song. I will keep it next to the Chris Gaines CD in my storage rack. Maybe it is time for Garth to retire for real, he seems to have lost some of his creativity and is a bit out of touch with the emotions that make a song memorable... like ""The Dance"". Maybe when the dust settles in his personal life and he matures more he will gain new insights that he will be able to put into words, or songs of his own again. Until then, I will definately listen before I buy!"
3,Nice Album,"Good songs; but a little too country for me. Bought it for the song ""When You Come Back to Me Again"" - beautiful song; love it."
2,Not as shown,"The door mat is just ok--the actual item received does not match the picture on the website at the time of the order (12/17/11). I was ordering based on the image as much as the description---the doormat pictured looks really cool, the one received is plain and boring. I could return the item, but it's a gift and there isn't time to order something else. Normally Amazon's images are accurate, but in this case it is not. Hopefully they update the image with the correct picture."
1,Too Many Distractions!,"The chants, although impressive, were littered with coughs, throat clearings and sniffling---all by someone very close to the microphone. This was definitely a ""real"" recording, no frills---but I found all the extra little noises distracting."
2,The animation is bad and the prince is a jerk! pretty good,"A pleasent little picture for the little kids. The animation is good, but, it's slapped together, drawn-computerised, 2d-3d, you know.the main characters are air heads, all except the red haired female lead who does all the work, (she saves her brother and endes up with an ulcer at the end of the film) the story line is simple enough to entertain 7- down, the bright colours are atractive as are the fairies.Not family fun !Interesting for little kids only!"
5,Exactly that the Essentials Needed!,I know absolutly nothing about linux. Using this book I was able to install and configure linux slackware. It was very easy reading and quick to the point. [...] Only complaint is I want to learn more. But I have learned no book contains all the info I'll ever need.
4,Enjoyable and Dated,"This is a wonderful novel in a brittle midcentury manner. It reads quickly and well, highly articulated, rather bleak. I think it provides substantial insight into the mindset of the British upper class in the period within the world wars."
2,"Boring, trite","While this book is better written in terms of vocabulary and turn of phrase than most modern ""chic lit,"" it's one of the most boring books I've ever read. Way too much exposition for modern tastes, half the characters are flat as if the author didn't have enough imagination to create too many, and none of them are drawn in a compelling manner. I care for none of them."
5,Daughter's favorite Christmas gift,Our family likes to laugh so this CD is wonderful. The songs are a lot of fun and still classical.
3,Fair Project,"This album cannot be compared with other SCC albums. I did not like it much. I couldn't get my ear to appreciate the songs. They were too noisy. ""DECLARATION"" and ""SPEECHLESS"" are a lot better albums than this one."
4,Love CD,"The younger fan of Mr. Chapman's last two CD's will not enjoy, but this makes a nice gift for the love of your life. Easy love songs."
4,Childrens' Book,"I grew up with the original German version of this book and have read it to two generations of American children in my own translation. Children are fascinated by the graphic stories and pictures which take a simple approach to ""crime & punishment"". Some of the children I had read this book to are now in their 40's and still talk about the book and how it impressed upon them the things a child should and should not do. Adults generally find the content and it's graphics too brutal but I believe it to be no more violent that the classic fairy tales.The English translation is clumsy but it conveys the stories quite accurately."
5,Hot stuff!!!!,There is nothing more wonderful than having a bunch of lovely women in one movie at the sam time!!!
3,Smells great but doesnt last long,Got this as a holiday gift. I am a big fan of the house of creed but this cologne just doesnt last. 3 spritzes and an hour later it's almost as if you didnt spray it.
3,great scent,"very good scent but it doesnt last all day a few hours maybe 3 or 4 at best but for me its ok i guess i bought the sample first so i was aware of its shortcomings [its lack of staying power] however the scent is that impressive there are a lot of colonges on the martket, great smelling at lower prices with a little better staying power but this scent has a little something special the wife loves it as well so for me its worth it it will last me a bit because i dont plan to use it all the time not at this price so its good for those special nights dont expect to put it on during the day and expect it last all night not going to happen but maybe out to dinner and the drive home its a very nice smell i dont wish that they made it to last a bit longer ,on that note i wish i could last a bit longer too11 thats my take on it ."
1,Has a very strong tobacco smell.,Be careful when ordering the Creed perfumes in the millesime size. they are not clearly labeled and I did not receive the one I wanted.
5,Widowed,"Recently widowed myself, I appreciated the information from this book and plan to pass it on to a friend and maybe order more copies in the future."
4,"Pat, we hardly knew ye...","Just when you thought it was all over but the sweeping, along comes an album that redefines a genre so completely that you're forced to go back to square one. In a collection that I think it's fair to say nobody saw coming, Pat Boone does for Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, and Deep Purple what he had previously only done for Little Richard and Fats Domino...Genius!!"
3,Fun and Goofy Novelty Album,"If you watch The Osbournes MTV show, then you've already heard Pat's infamous version of ""Crazy Train""and you have a pretty good idea what the rest of the album sounds like. Metallica, AC/DC, Hendrix and Alice Cooper are some of the other victims who get Pat's emasculating Vegas lounge treatment. Personally, I enjoy this album and actually feel like Pat Boone makes more sense to me in this context. This was actually a really influential album because it kicked off a new sub-genre of lounge artists doing Vegas style covers of Rock and Rap songs. After Pat came Bud E. Love and Lounge Against the Machine doing essentailly the same thing to Nine Inch Nails and Sir Mix-a-Lot. If you find this used at a good price, you should get it."
1,Soooo lost in translation...,"French film.So Bad.Weird.Very looong story short. Ugly French girl drops out of med school to become a pimp, and has a thing for OLD women.Warning ** very unappealing sex scene with a 70 year old woman.Spoiler** she wants a baby, so she sleeps with a guy, changes mind gives bb away. end.Would never recommend this film."
1,Thief friendly,"Having owned this product for a few months i was happy and convinced of it's security, mainly for its stopping of the opportunistic thief. But i was convinced that it would halt somebody more determined.... This was where i let a cocky kid with a pair of pliers have a go at cutting through the cable. Imagine my horror when i heard a 'snip'.Result - good for the look of security, bad if your local hoodlum has pliers on them.Gutted."
4,Best sunglass retainers!!!!!!,"Have used these for years. The best thing about chums is if they get dirty,you can throw them in the wash and they come out looking like new(well almost)."
4,Wors as expected,"These work as I expected. A little much for the shipping, and shipped by mail rather than express as requested, BUT they arrived before the stated shipping date. Still worth the price, even with the shipping charge, got 2 for less then the cost of 1 in the store."
1,Broke and Boring,The 1st CD does not play in any of my machines so I don't know if the content was good or not. The other CDs will play but the content was boring and the guy just talked about how great he was. Don't waste your money.
5,ABSOLUTELY AWESOME ! WORKS FOR THIS INSOMNIAC,"I have severe insomnia, and am being treated for an anxiety disorder as well, and this book is one I never want to be without again. I have been listening to it regularly for about a year ! Some sleep / meditation audiobooks get old fast, and quit working for me...this one never does. It relaxes me even if Im frustrated, angry anxious....this book addresses all of those things so you can get a decent nights sleep...and shut your anxiety or worries down ! I have a lot of these type of materials, but none have helped me more than this one...the authors voice and the music are so soothing...even works if there is noise around me, I can block it out and sleep"
4,"Ahhh no, Where's ""Simply Beautiful?""","I can easily rate this a 4 w/o hearing it. The only reason I didn't give it a five is ""Simply Beautiful"" was not included. This (recently) because my favorite Al Green song and definitely needs to be heard by others."
1,BEWARE,I recently purchased this DVD. There is no warning that it comes only with German soundtrack. Unless you are fluent in German do not buy this.You will be disappointed and will have wasted your money
4,Great singer who died young,"Fernando Fernández (1934-81), who died tragically young (from a heart attack according to one source, from a cerebral hemorrhage according to another) was a Gypsy with a rajo voice who was a master of the cantes of his native Jerez — soleares, seguiriyas and bulerías. Perhaps because of the scarcity of material (he recorded comparatively little), the material on this album is not always totally felicitous — e.g. there are moments when the accompanist is going in a different direction from the singer. However, there is much to enjoy, particularly the Fiesta por Bulerías at the end with Romerito, El Borrico, El Diamante Negro, El Sordera and El Sernita.Guitarists are Paco de Antequera on two tracks, Manuel Morao on the rest.The total time is 40'00""."
5,a dream book,"i have read everything mary jo putney,every single book and like many i fell in love with the fallen angels,but this book was amazing i couldn't put it down. michael kenyon just took my heart he is a hero and a daling."
5,The best book of the Fallen Angels Series!,"Of all the books in the Fallen Angels series, this one is my favorite. It has everything - romance, action, emotion, drama, revelations, and a happy ending. I think that Lord Michael Kenyon deserves a book like this after all he has been through in past books, and Catherine Melbourne is the perfect match as a heroine for him. I would definately recommend this book to all Mary Jo Putnay fans! It is by far one of her best."
2,Did not like these,"These flashcards were meant to be used with their DVDs, which I don't own. So I'm not sure if the photos they use come from the DVDs but some of the pictures are really ugly. Overall I think there has got to be better, nicer looking flashcards."
2,"A quirky, unclassifiable book, but not my bag.","I would recommend this book to literary types, anyone who like the movie ""The Piano"", & maybe even Northern Exposure fans. This book skirts many genres Western, science fiction, fantasy, quest novel, & mainstream literature without really belonging in any of them. The moments about oddball history were my favorites. Also Fowler is willing to show the negative sides of feminists(In fact I thought the feminist character was rather unpleasant & as exploitive of sarah as anyone) Although the feminist agenda is there & I think that's what turned me off. (I remember all the ""sane"" white males being unpleasant, but that may not be true.) The idea that the eccentrics are ,perhaps, better people is appealing & the book has a certain charm. This is a book that I think some will absolutely love, I'm just not one of them."
1,Pooh-Yuck!,"NO,No,No, you don't want to read this. I kept waiting for something, anything to make sense. Alot of rambling on and on about oddball historical events in the past that had nothing to do with the actual story except the fact that the story was oddball enough. And who was this Sarah Canary? We never find out! We never really find out why she is mad, where she came from, where she was going. We only catch her in the middle of her journey where she runs across several other oddball characters that are not endearing or interesting. All in all Pooh-Yuck, a waste of money and time!"
1,Dreary,"I may be in the minority, but I found this book dreary, never-ending, and never going anywhere. Interesting period, but a waste of time. Presumptuous to think that this would be a great read for a book club (re: the pages at the back of the book containing discussion questions, and even the authors notes). May be thought provoking for high schoolers, if they can get through it."
3,DVD,I am sure it would be fine but due to an oversite on my part I didn't realise it could only be played in a certain region.It didnot inicate this on the selling details/or immediately catch my attention.Can't be bothered to return it.Daphne
4,Political firecracker.,"The Way We Were is a profound film of two people who love each other but can't seem to make it work due to their opposing political views. Barbra Streisand and Robert Redford are movie magic together, their chemistry is electric and their acting is impeccable. I loved how honest this film was, the ending is sad but it's nice to see a romantic drama have a realistic outcome and not one that is wishy-washy or contrived. Definitely worth checking out, enjoy!"
3,A must have -- IF you like Streisand,"Watching this film again after 10 years reminded me of why I hadn't seen it in so long: the story is not that good. I never understood why they broke up, until I saw the additional footage provided in this DVD. While it's great that the additional footage is available, I don't understand why they buried it in the documentary. They should have included the extra scenes in their entirety and made them accesible via the menu.The best part of this movie: Streisand's brilliant performance. As for Redford, I seem to have trouble reading him in a number of scenes.In short, if you like Streisand, you must have this."
5,The way we were review,"I ordered this movie because I heard from Sarah Jessica Parker that it was a great movie. I love it. It does get pretty sad but It's a great flick, a classic. I got it here for only $3 and some change. Barbra Streisand rocks!"
4,Great Service,Arrived really quickly and I gave it away as a gift; I've heard no complaints so it must be in excellent condition.
2,This is not the Starlight Express I know and love!,"This version of Starlight Express is not what I'd hoped for;no purist would appreciate it. Key characters are removed, lyrics are edited or changed completely, and tracks I'd been looking forward to listening to again have been entirely ommitted. It is almost another musical unto itself. I would reccomend either the London or the New York cast recordings (in that order) , but this ""new"" recording doesn't do justice to the original work."
4,Better performances than OLC,"In my opinion, this version of Starlight Express has much better vocal performances/comic timing than the original CD. While some songs are unfortunately taken out (Only He), new ones are added, and in some cases turn out better than the songs on the original CD, mostly because of the way they are performed.Greaseball, Electra, Dinah, Pearl, and Rusty are much better here than in the rather lifeless performances of the OLC. If you have the original album, get this one, too. You might like it less, you might like it more, but it's fun to compare. Some songs, like AC/DC and Pumpin' Iron, sound MUCH different here than in their original version.I give the OLC 3 stars for the performances, and 4 for the music in general. This one would be 5 for performances, and 3 for the songs (I don't like the new Rap, and songs like Crazy aren't as good as some old ones that have been takes out). And for StEx fans, it's a must-have."
1,crapy,by the way im over 13 but this hunk a crap wont even work it skips if u hit it and the battries wont even work in it so but 10$ save that money for somtin better like a shoe shinner na kiddin but really dont buy this $#!t
5,Fantastic,"if you haven't had the chance to see U2 than this film is for you,one of the best i have seen"
3,U2 Rose Bowl,"Listening to the video is not of course the same thing as seeing the band live, but gives good memories.Agree with the one who was complaining about the shots being too short, jumping too quickly from one person to the other"
3,"Good concert, sub-par production","The other reviews are correct. It seems as if the editors weren't even listening to/feeling the story. Too many unnecessary cuts, dissolves, etc. I'll leave the video comments to other reviews.My major disappointment is with the audio engineering. I was very excited to hear this in high-def Bluray format, but the sound mixing is just horrible. Bono's vocals are cemented to the center channel with no feel of depth and width. The surrounds don't offer much in terms of ambiance. Made a direct comparison to Madonna's Stick n Sweet Tour on BD, and the two discs are worlds apart. Too bad."
4,"Customer service cleaned up the mess, somebody did...","I was waiting for this item to receive at home, but what a bad surprise to get a DVD version and not the Bluray version i ordered. The company who sells this item sucks (was a third party), they sent me a DVD instead of a Bluray version of this concert, but simply Amazon customer service cleaned up the mess... i called to ask how to return this item, as it was NOT what i ordered and expected to get... they just refund me all the money and let me keep this item... So i will order this from another source to get this item for real... Thanks Amazon for an amazing service (at least i wasn't charged for this)."
5,AMAZING,"Hands down, one of the best performances I've ever seen. I've been to 4 U2 concerts now, and by dumb luck, we made it to the inner circle. We saw U2 at Cowboy's Stadium, in and of itself, impressive. Glad to see it is finally here. If this captures half the excitement I whitened first hand, I would say it is well worth the purchase."
4,great show!!!,i saw this show in camp nou in barcelona on july 2 was great!!! and this show was good too i saw on youtube live but i think better was edit the dvd/bd of a european tour anyway i gonna buy this one!!
5,Great to relive the concert,"Frankly I have no idea what some of these reviewers have a problem with. They must have gone to some high end film school, or wish they did. I was hesitant to buy this for some time due to the negative reviews This is an excellent show to watch, (especially if you went to the concert) I would highly recommend it."
2,Awesome tech - Horrible performance,"It's just like the subject. The techology in this show is almost unbelivable, worth watch it only for this.U2..This one used to be one of my favourite band ever. Now they are a pale group with signs of patetism.No hard feelings boys, think about leave the road."
5,U2 360 at the Rose Bowl,"Best Concert seen Live, Best Concert on dvd, Huge production!! Excellent Sound and camera work! Well down guys!! Get well Bono! Canadian Fan."
2,"Disappointing show, poor quality video","I received this and The Bruce Springsteen, London Calling BluRays the same day. After watching Springsteen I couldn't even sit through this. I seriously don't see how this could have been shot on HD equipment. The difference between this and the Springsteen concert is like the difference between a DVD and a VHS tape. Heck, The Who, Live at Kilburn, which was shot 33 years ago looks better than this. Strangely, some of the bonus material (specifically the making of feature)is of far better resolution. The 2011 leg of the tour, where the band replaced some of the weaker new material with songs from Achtung Baby and Zooropa was far better. This video could have been improvedhad they waited for a later concert after the show and setlist had been perfected."
2,Don't bother paying extra for Blu-Ray,"I give this a 5 for the marvelous DTS soundtrack and a minus 1 for the horrendous video. For a group that is supposedly on the cutting edge of multimedia, the video on this blu-ray looks like one of my old VHS tapes from the early 90's. Dark, grainy, and off-color. I should know because I attended this concert. Having seen clips of the upcoming Springsteen dvd which is in true HD, I plan on returning this in exchange for that as soon as possible. What a shame. Wait for 2 months when this appears in the bargain bin at Walgreens."
2,U2 Live Vid's just get worse and worse,"I was at this show in CA. Good show and was really looking forward to this release since I was part of it. Was I disappointed.OMG the amount of shaking there is in this video is just amazing. There is some massive jerking going on in this video. The video is not smooth at all. Very very poor quality considering this is the biggest band in the world right now. My theory on this, well here goes: As you know this show was broadcast live on YouTube and and I think they just used the same cameras for this release. I was next to one of the cameras and believe they were not exactly the HD cameras you see ESPN crews using.Anyways sound wise it is decent, but video quality wise it just appears that it is buffering all the time."
2,"Great Show, Lousy Disk","I saw this show in Tampa, an unforgetable performance. Unfortunately as others have noted, the quality of this video is simply sub-par and nowhere near HD/BD quality. Save your money and catch them live before they get really old."
3,"Get U2 ""Go Home"" DVD instead","The problem with this show is that it lacks any kind of intimacy. The sheer magnitude of the production makes it more like a half-time Super Bowl show. Bono says the 360 setup is supposed to bring the fans closer to the band (and vice-versa), but I think it's just the opposite. Never have I seen U2 less connected to their audience as in this DVD/Blu-ray production.We watched the entire concert, but had to split our viewing over three evenings because the ADD-style editing (2 seconds per shot), jiggly camera work and grainy picture quality is enough to give you a headache. For my money, I recommend the 2001 ""Go Home"" DVD which is far superior in almost every respect."
1,this is just the book....not the deck,"Was disappointed, this is just the book about the deck, not the deck. The deck is out of print and is very hard to get, unless you want to pay lots of $$$$$. One would think the deck would still be in print if the book is. Now I have a book for a tarot deck that I'll probably never get, useless."
1,YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN THIS GUIDE,"I've purchased and relied on several Lonely Planet Guides. Unlike the other guides, the Lonely Planet Guide to Spain was not useful or helpful. Although I travelled to Spain in 2005, the 2005 edition's information concerning prices for lodgings, food, transportation and attractions was already out of date. One wonders when it was last updated. Moreover, the book is bulky and poorly organized, making it difficult to pinpoint information. Finally, information concerning secondary cities and towns is impressionistic at best. The Lonely Planet Guide to Spain was a disappointment, poor value and--most importantly--a poor guide to Spain."
1,shipping took foreever!,"The book arrived in brand new condition, as indicated, however the book took foreever to arrive! The seller was prompt in answering me back about the status of the book but it took too long to arrive."
1,I AM NOT SURPRISED BOOKS LIKE THIS ARE WRITTEN!,"Unfortunately, in our society, people are willing to just about sell their soul to make a buck. One quick and easy way is to identify something or someone a group of people flat out hate and create a product catering to that hatred. You do not need to worry about accuracy or full truths. Instead, fill it with as much half accurate or completely made up information as possible and these people will eat it up. They are not interested in getting news from multiple outlets, all over the political spectrum. Instead, they are interested in just drinking Kool Aid and calling themselves informed.This is one of those products. It is largely BS and is intended to prey on the hatred and flat out ignorance of extreme liberals in order to make a buck. If you absolutely MUST read it, look for it in a used book store or a library. By not putting another penny in Kitty's pocket, we can hopefully cut down of the books like her's or Ed Klein's new one about Hillary."
1,difficult book,This book was impossible for me to read. Many pages of junk about a bad president and his family.
1,Oh my poor IQ,"Too much Shel is NOT a good thing! I felt my IQ level drop as I read this book, I wasn’t amused by his style and I’m sorry I didn’t read up on him more before I purchased several of his books. BE SURE you do your research because how he expresses himself is simply a matter of opinion, you just might not like it!"
5,A Lifetime Favorite,"Lafcadio, The Lion Who Shot Back has been a favorite of mine for over 20 years, and I love to share it! The book can be difficult to find in brick-and-mortar stores, unlike other Silverstein books for youngsters. That fact has always baffled me, as Lafcadio is one of Uncle Shelby's best.Lafcadio is best when read aloud, and the little ones will often sit still for a full reading, it's just that good. Older children note, ""It really left me hanging! What happens to him?"" It's the perfect beginning of a conversation about understanding and being true to yourself, not changing to be what others expect or want you to be.I still wonder what happened to Lafcadio, and hope he is happy, wherever he is, and that he has plenty of marshmallows."
1,"did not get this watch, was sent a different watch","this was a false advertisement, the watch pictured is not the watch that was received. don't be fooled."
5,"Yup, as good as hot yoga!! Without the heat.","I went to 6 sessions of Bikram hot yoga, and liked the intensity of their workout. But not the sweaty smell, high humidity, and heat. Darn glad that there is a VHS version of it. Her 27 routines are slightly different than Bikram, but I believed that it might be based on the older routines, where a few were removed for safety to the neck, and prevention of injury. Certainly don't want to make Bikram's guru any richer. I am going to stick to this VHS tape. To bad they can not recut it in DVD due to high risk of lawsuit from Bikram.To me, it is total garbage of the monopoly of these 27 poses. Too bad no one is willing to take them on.... How can you copyright stretching poses?"
5,Raquel Really Gives You a Workout,"This is the tape that started me on yoga. She really gives you a workout. You feel great afterwards. I'd highly recommend this tape (and associated book, if you can find it).Her program will really keep you in shape, and your body toned."
5,Beedly Deedly Dee-Two Thumbs Up,"Cabaret is a musical filled with silly songs, but it is a serious musical as well. The soundtrack is well worth owning. There's parts of Cabaret that are about the Nazi era. If you've never seen the movie(which I have), you'd think that ""Tomorrow Belongs to Me,"" is a comforting song. But in fact is a very synical song, sung quietly. I'd have to say that my favorite song in the musical is ""Two Ladies."""
5,OMG,BEST RAP CD EVER. CLIPSE REALLY OUTDID THEM SELFS ON THIS ONE. IT WAS WELL WORTH THE 3 YEAR WAIT.
3,"Critics LOVE this album, but...","To me it's just okay. Definitely some nice tracks like ""Wamp Wamp"" with the Boss, Slim Thug. That song seemed a lil cheesey to me at first, but it's grown on me. However the Neptunes' production seems a bit minimal (with some treble and bass) with no filler or even slightly catchy background music. I'm still listening to it so maybe the album will grow on me. Bu for now it's just iight."
2,Not mellow,"I have A LOT of ""Jazz for a..."" CDs, and this has been my least favorite. The songs really aren't that mellow. I found them to be either too upbeat, or repetative. I liked 'Jazz for When You're Alone' and 'Jazz for the Quiet Times' much better. I never listen to this one."
5,Replacement GMC Sonoma wiper motor,This was the perfect replacement for my worn out wiper motor and at a great price.
4,a very helpful learning tool,"We have learned that buying advanced High School math textbook answer keys are very helpful for our children in learning. An answer in the back of the bock is nice, but when you don't achieve the right answer, then what do you do? The answer key alows you to check your work at various steps or see how to solve the problem. You have to use it properly. It is a reference after you have worked the problem. It is not to be used while you work the problem."
1,DAMAGED !!,"I received this product sealed, but its damaged, for the first time I installed and never worked. Seller never gave me a possible solution.Thats it!!"
5,A Dark Classic,"This is a classic of the genre written by a controversial icon. Along with the author's Witchcraft for Tomorrow, this gives the real occult practitioner solid backing for those like myself who were unsure if they were just a dabbler or a real live one. It explains early on that some such as myself use maskes in their ritual practice. I started using masks recently around Halloween this year, here's for another 100 years of the practice of witchcraft. The dark side cover artwork is excellent, a real piece of vintage 1980s style, style which is lost in this day and age."
4,Pretty thorough,"For me, this book was not only thorough, but easy to read and interesting. There were moments that I thought the book was a bit slow, but hey, nothing informative is going to be 100% interesting all the way through. But on a whole, this was a great book to learn about the origins and history of witchcraft. Beginners should definetly get this book and really realize what being a witch was like in the past and how we should appreciate how far we have come since than."
5,Father and Son !,The Story of Mr Grosvenor and his experience was riveting. The lenghts that were gone to; to revisit the locations and find the people should be the hallmark for all future documentaries. Thank You Mr Grosvenor for your service and story.
5,Extremely Funny,"Along with Animal House, this is one of the best films of its genre! Many hilarious scenes including their fraternity party and the school olympics. Robert Caradine is the ultimate nerd! The follow-up movie is hilarious too!"
5,All you need to get started,"If you want to photograph any sort of artwork, this volume will get you going. All aspects of the task are considered, and the text is lucid, with plentiful illustrations. Various sorts of film, lighting, camera gear, filtration, testing, and lighting technique are covered. These things are not just catalogued, but evaluated by the author based on his years of experience."
1,TFF's best package a CRYING Shame,"Was quite disappointed with the overall selection of songs for this latest ""best"" package. While Tears For Fears' had only a short run of hit singles in the mid to late 80's, their work was far more exciting than what is presented here. Early synth-pop tracks like ""pale shelter"" were overlooked as was Orzabal's later ""solo"" TFF work. The package does try to update the TFF story with the inclusion of ""break it down again"" (the only ""solo"" Orzabal track) but still falls short of being a great ""best of"" collection. Check out ""tears roll down (greatest hits 82-92) instead."
3,"Just never caught me up, sadly...","Unfortunately, I couldn't ever get into this book. I liked the protagonist well enough, although her actions and motivations were as puzzling as her eclectic group of friends. I couldn't quite make sense of why one of the characters had to die--other than having the feeling that they should! And the events that happened as a result never fell into place for me, either.Now, I do understand that Things Were At Work and Needed to Happen That Way and it was all subtle and marvelous--I'm not THAT dense! But I just never related to any of it: The world, the characters, the events, the motivations...It's not badly written. I'm sure others may find this an enjoyable book. I can't in conscience give it a very low mark because of my own odd lack of interest. I must say that it is rare that I don't 'grok' a book, but it happens.... I did like the cover painting a lot! I think it is by Rowena--one of her best."
1,You should have bought a K-Rain!,"I have experienced getting soak and wet trying to set the spray pattern with this sprinkler. I gave up and purchased a K-Rain gear drive 5"". They are the easiest to set on the market with no hassles and no getting wet! My suggestion is you should have bought a K-rain!"
5,Ready to Go,Having more than 1 motorcycle does NOT ensure they all will have their battery charged and ready to go. The Battery Tender has extended previous batteries for up to 5 years. Most motorcycle bateries only last 1 year. I will always add one to any new motorcycle that I get. Cheaper than buying a new battery each year.
1,Doesn't work,"I own several of these and the first time I buy one from an online dealer, it doesn't work. Charger shows green all the time (fully charged) even on dead battery and will not charge at all. Trying to send back, but already installed and used the other pieces it came with on other vehicles."
2,Not what you think,Good charger. Works well. Bought this for a VW and used it last winter. Went to put the battery back in the bug and it would not hold a charge. Dead cell. Don't just plug it in and come back a few months later. I did on a new battery and the charger had boiled the acid out of the battery. Dead cell and i had to buy a new battery. The other battery was only a year and half to 2 years old. It charges well and i think worth the money but don't just leave it on for long periods of time. Don't trust their advertiseing. Said something to the company and they gave no response at all.
4,Good for beginners. Doesn't go into depth.,"This is a good book that will help you get started on Microsoft's SQL Server Analysis Services.You'll get to learn how to build a Cube, build a Dimension and the different types of Measures.You'll learn how to determine the type of dimensions you have.You'll learn how to do some basic tricks.But you won't learn any of the advanced topics that I was hoping for.This book doesn't go into any details about how historical data is handled.How to do some basic MDX programming.How to make custom incremental cube processing.etc.This is a beginner's book, as the title suggests, that will take you from clueless to comfortable in Analysis Services in a short period of time.That's why I gave it 4 stars.This book in no way substitutes a good book on OLAP and/or data warehousing (such as Kimbal's books)."
4,John shares his struggles.....,in this book which reads like a conversation. Funny and enlightening although sometimes he lost me by starting a story in the midst of one already being told. John Edward is one of my favorite people and it's nice to know that he struggled just like everyone else on his way to the top.
5,"An Emotional, yet Educational Experience","This is the first book by John Edward that I have ever read, but it definitely won't be the last. I felt, as many other readers did, that John was speaking directly to me. I was incredibly moved by a lot of the experiences shared in this book, especially the ones involving Carl Perkins' daughter. I enjoyed learning about the process that others besides John Edward went through on the path to their own development... If you don't buy this book, borrow it from someone who did!"
1,Psychic sellout,"If you want to know how to break into show biz and be famous, buy this book. If you are hurting and need advice from the other side, Read George Anderson or Rosemary Altea. The arrogance in this book was very off-putting"
5,"""Crossing Over"" by John Edward - CD","Listening to John, is like hearing from an old friend. Not only is it interesting, it hits so close to home and real truth. How fortunate we are to have John to teach us, and put himself out there for all to see and hear.It is really reaffirming for what I have always believed. I grew up with a family who were firm believers in more than just the physical life. (My son and I told each other when the programs first cam on the television.)Thank you John Edward for what you say and do! I Love it, and appreciate it."
2,"Not as good as ""One last Time"" or ""What if god were sun""","I'm a John Edward fan, but didn't enjoy this book. In fact, I couldn't finish it. I loved ""ONE LAST TIME"" and ""WHAT IF GOD WERE THE SUN"". This book is difficult to follow because too many names are introduced, too much technical lingo. You need to take notes just to keep it all straight. I understand it's an auto-biography and in life, several people cross your path, but this was just too much. I think he could have simplified his story and left the names on the acknowledgment page. Sorry, John...didn't like this one."
3,"We want more than your experiences, we want ours too!","John is a good writer, and communicates well on this side besides the other side! What I think is lacking is a broader scope of experiences. What other authors, like Tiffany Snow and Sylvia Browne are doing, is touching many aspects and challenging the reader to do the same, BESIDES telling the personal experiences. Too often, John just tells his own stories, which are entertaining, but limited. But, this book I like better than his other one, ""after life,"" which is more of the same and even dryer than this one."
4,Great material but...,"This set has 15 episodes, and Benny is hilarious. The quality of the DVDs isn't the best. Both of the DVDs I got had these little swirly marks on them, and each had a point on the DVD where they skipped. However, that still gave me 13 episodes that worked great (and I could get almost all of the other two if I hit fast forward at the right point). Hey, what can you expect for the price? And maybe I just got unlucky and got a set off a bad batch. Still, all that said, I'd buy them again in a heartbeat."
2,Jack Benny Show,Ken and I were very disappointed in this show. It is very dated and his mannerism of staring at the audience may have been funny in the early 60's. But definately not today.
2,Was Disappointed it's a Workbook,"Be aware that this is a workbook, and although the information is interesting to a young child who craves it, the activities in the workbook are not appropriate for young children. The print in this book is very small, too small for young children in my opinion. The book format looks like it is geared to older primary students, but the depth of information seems inadequate for that age bracket.The book on the whole is interesting. It gives facts curious children like, such as what Bush likes to eat, tells about Mrs. Bush, and the family pets. I do not regret my purchase, but wished I had known a bit more beforehand."
3,Informative,"If you have questions about Weslian theology Purkiser's book is a great place to have many questions answered. However, this is not an easy read. It would be best to read this book with your Bible and a good dictionary handy. Some of the terms are never defined in the length of the book."
4,All is True in the Mind,"I agree that this is not the best biography of Anais Nin. Yet, we have to realize that she is not the easiest person to write a book about. I admire Noel Riley Fitch for attempting. I love reading about Anais--she was an amazing woman. And I think she knew more about the TRUTH then we think she did. She created atmosphere and breathable relationships. This biography tells of her friends and enemies alike---her success and failures."
5,Excellent popcorn!,"This is by far the best bagged popcorn I've ever eaten. The smoked gouda flavor isn't really subtle, but who wants subtle in a snack like this? It comes out and whacks you on the head--HEY, I'M POWDERED GOUDA--and has a great, full-bodied flavor."
2,They don't taste too good.,"Not only is the popcorn incredibly salty, but they do not taste very crispy. Quite stale. Overall, disappointing. I sent my stuff overseas with delivery within 4 days after receiving them, so it is not that I kept them too long. Too bad, they are too far to return. Overall a disappointing experience."
4,"""Awesome""","I purchased this item for my son who is stationed in Kindahar, Afghanstan. I had the mini fridge sent to me first so I could try it out and make sure it worked (and it did) then I forwared on to him. About two weeks ago he made a short call to us and in our conversation he said ""O by the way the mini fridge is awesome and works fine."" Delivery time after placeing the order was exceptional and the packing was superior."
1,Let LA liquidators take this to the landfill rather than you,"As noted by other reviewers, this is neither fridge nor warmer oven. It is a ""cooler/warmer"" which is something I doubt anyone one wants or needs. This device has a tiny fan and maybe a little compressor and heating element. It is capable of slowing the warming of already cold items or, in the warm mode, slowing the cooling of already warm items. It is not capable of cooling warm items (like a can of soda) nor capable or warming cold items. I cannot think of any practical use for it nor I bet can many other people...which is why it is being sold by a liquidator."
1,Had to return it,"I was just looking for something small to put under my desk in my office to keep my lunch cold (you know, sandwich, yogurt, standard stuff). The unit is a great size, but really doesn't get cold enough. I kept this running for 3-4 days, thinking that maybe it needed to gear up for a while and get colder, but no luck. The back wall of the unit gets pretty cool, but the inside cavity does not. I finally had to return it and was told I'd only get a full refund if the unit was defective. They ended up charging me a 20% or so ""restocking fee"" for the return and said they tested it and that it worked fine for what I had been trying to use it for. I respectfully disagree. If you're looking for something to get soda about 10 degrees colder than room temperature, this is your product. If you're looking for a small fridge for your office, keep looking."
1,Hardly a 'critical examination',This book is a tiresome rant of the authors personal opinions. His section on alternative medicine is especially uninformed. He claims that food additives are perectly safe and suggests that anyone who questions the FDA must be crazy.
2,Can you say lame?,"This book was boring beyond belief. The story was predictable and transparent, and the characters were completely unrealistic. If you are looking for something to help you sleep at night, this could be a find. Ohterwise, just pick up the dictionary, which in my opinion is more interesting."
2,band lovers beware,"sub-par effort on most tunes, possible exception of the jack johnson cover. buy the originals - as a die hard band fan I was very dissapointed"
4,Endless Highway,"The Band is my all-time favorite rock group and believe them to be one of the best ever so for other artists to attempt to reinterpret the Band's music is an act of courage -- or insanity. Overall the songs were well recreated but none rise to the quality of the original. The Band's unique and brilliant talents couldn't possibly be matched. Having said this, I'm glad that I bought the CD and enjoy it."
5,It's true: Everything does change.,"Wow! This is more realistic and so much better than theBaby-Sitters Club. There was one lady who said that Ann ignores moralvalues in writing this book, but, ""hello!"" It's a book, lady. If all books had perfect characters and did everything perfectly, it would be sooo boring! So, congratulations, Ann! YOu've earned tons of new readers and that was the perfect start to a new series."
1,I can't believe it!,"I used to LOVE the other BSC books so I figured, okay she's just going to give it a TINY makeover, new covers and a little bit more maturity. I never exspected her to drop over half the club, change their personalities so drastically, and introduce such immoral things. How can you be friends forever if they are all dropping out of the club? And why all the sudden does she have to bring extremely immoral ideas into the situation. I was a little upset about 13 year olds seriously dating in the old ones(I thought that was a little do mature for 9-12 year olds), but now she has stepped beyond the girls having boyfriends, Stacey's father is now considering having a live in girlfriend. Why is it that everything has to change so much? The old books were just wonderful, why did they have to change? I'm very disappointed and sorry I invested my money in this one and the one to follow!"
2,Not Brightfield's best Choose Your Own Adventure book,"I found Master of TaeKwonDo a little disappointing after reading Brightfield's other books. The book was only about a madman's plot to take over the world and saving your friend Ling. Also, it's impossible to actually defeat the bad guy in book. Save your money and buy one of Brightfield's better Choose your own adventure books: Master of Kung Fu, Master of Karate, Master of Martial Arts, or Master of Aikido."
2,not worth the money,"This mandoline slicer was a disappointment. It is very difficult to operate, especially when slicing tougher vegetables like butternut squash or even onions. It is very hard to keep the vegetables in place and you have to press down so hard to keep them from sliding off that it feels like you're about to break the thing in half. I'm sticking to knives and the food processor from now on."
1,Piece of junk!,"I bought this about a year ago to replace a cheap plastic V-slicer that worked OK for several years, but thought I'd like a more versatile instrument. Now I wonder how Cuisinart let this slip through their engineering design section. Its gripper thing that's supposed to hold the veggies (or whatever) has such short spikes that the veggies slip off. I finally reverted to the gripper from my old cheapie one. The blade on the Cuisinart shreds, rather than slices -- very dull and clearly not well thought out. It's difficult to clean, tends to rust if left to dry by itself, and simply doesn't do what it is intended to do. Way, way overpriced. I would give it a ""0"" star rating if that were an option."
1,Shouldv've read the reviews first,"I expected a lot from this being a cuisinart product. It looks simple to use and is stainless steel. However, I found that this device is the most frustrating gaget I've ever used. the Knob that holds the blade in place is ALWAYS in the way of any item being sliced and the force at which you must push the item being sliced is too much. I tried balencing this over a bowl to keep from catching sliced items on the knob but no avail, every item jambs in this. I think that cuisnart should buy all these back from anyone that has them. I too would give less then 0 stars if I could."
1,Could not believe that this piece of junk was made by Cuisinart,"This has to be the worst designed product for slicing food I can imagine. The only way to make it worse would be to add ""speed bumps"" á la the slides in ""Parks and Recreation"".First, the adjustment knob clogs the food exit, the blade is dull and cannot handle vegetables like eggplant or squash, and there is a useless ""bump"" on the end that prevents you from slicing food longer than about 3-4 inches in length.You should consider this product as a wedding gift to your worst enemy."
1,"Cool -- shiny, but worst slicer ever","Well, it may not be the worst slicer in the world but it was the worse slicer I've ever seen or used. Except for all the stainless steel, there is nothing good about this slicer. Previous reviews have covered the awful design and cheap pieces so I'll just second them. Do not buy this off of Craigslist, or from a thrift store, or anywhere, new or used, for any amount of money. It's been discontinued (hopefully not because people were slicing their fingers off) but it's never too late to get a bad product off the market forever."
4,Brilliant Analysis,A wonderful synthesis of a subject that is key to understanding modern Hausa culture. Anyone interested in the future of central Africa should read this book.
2,Don't waste your time,"The story has a lot of potential, but unfortunately it was horible. Most of her novels are great and others are an easy read, but this one was not. The characters see each other and fall in love instatnly without saying more than two words to each other. The hero is not likeable, his chracter is undeveloped and he seems like a wimp. The story doesnt revolve around their romance at all and they barely have any scenes alone in the whole novel. The brothers get annoying at some point and so many unbelievable events happen. I read the reviews before I read the novel and thought it couldn't be that bad but it was. There's a little mystery at the end and even that turns out to be unbelieavble and dumb. I just can't believe how a novel can be written about two people who fall in love and they never get to know each other i the whole novel. I love JL and the malory novels bit this was a waste of time."
1,"""Less than awful""","This was better than the last few. But, sincethey've been awful - 'better' isn't saying much.Sadly, I'll just await the next Lindsey(?) novelat the Used Book Store."
3,"haven't read it yet, scared to read it too","Nope, that's right, haven't read it. To be fair, I give it 3 stars, right in the middle. I love Ms. Lindsey's book. I have all of them. But, the reviews tell me, it not going to be on par. So, I will wait for the mass paperback issue. I've been a fan since A Pirate's Love and went back to read Captive Bride. I used to pick up the 2 books every year. Then 1 book every year. Now,I guess that with infrequency of writing, the creative juices just have dried up. The last few books were very disappointing. But as a loyal fan, I will await the paperback issue to see how bad it can be. I hope that all the other reviews have been wrong and that this will be another Lindsey classic. But with the disappointment of the last few, I won't hold my breath."
2,WASTE OF TIME AND ... PAPER!,"This book is very disapointing. I only say that becouse all the rest of johanna lindsey books I'v ever read were terrific and had some kind of magic in them but this one did not. If you are terribly board then their is an exeption, you may read this book and not look like an idiot who cant find a good book. LOL! really dont read this book it it a wast of time."
1,Boring,"I don't usually do reviews but this is the worst book I have ever read. It was so repetative, Linc had to keep trying to prove that he wasn't violent. That's it. I stopped reading it because it just never got any better. At 1.99 I paid too much."
3,SanDist Reader/Writer,"I recently purchased a SanDisk CF Type I/II ImageMateUSB 2.0 Reader/Writer and while I think it very goodI do have a problem with it burying everything under2 folders. Personally I just want to ""grab 'n go"" soto speak and having to work my way down folders to getto the actual pictures is a bit annoying. Otherwise,I think this is an excellent tool."
2,"the guitar is there, but....................................","This is not one of my favorite records of Links. he seems to be repeating old songs and calling them something else... and was that some kind of cheap drum machine I heard? Nope, this is not the way I want to remember Link Wray. Unfortunately people say his live performances have gone the same way as this record. Very disappointing. May I suggest Bullshot as a great Link Wray record. That is the way I want to remember him."
4,Killing Me Softly,This was a good movie and had a suspense to it. Joseph Fiennes and Heather Graham were excellent in it.
2,Only worth buying to see Heather Graham nude,"My title says it all! If you want to see Heather Graham nude, buy the movie. Otherwise, don't bother. The plot is mildly entertaining but, by the end, I didn't really care if he was guilty or not."
2,Don't bother,"I hate being critical of this film because I love B movies, but this movie is bad. Really bad. Heather Graham is a beautiful woman, especially nude, but other than that this movie has nothing going for it. The acting is terrible, the plot is terrible, and the nudity is nothing you can't get from Boogie Nights. The only reason this movie gets two stars is becuase Heather Graham does great in the sex scenes despite the director failing to focus on her sensuality and just settling on getting her naked."
