5,A Masterful Collection by a Masteful Group,"Though missing some of the most popular songs the Temptations performed over the years, this collection contains some great, almost forgotten favorites and should be a part of any collection. The pul-out booklet could be more informative, but the images on the covers and inside are priceless.A true fan will enjoy this CD in their computer or in the car and the digital recording is masterful, just like the group who made the music. Sadly, the a capella version of My Girl is incomplete on this CD and not always found on the Emperors Of Soul CD either. Still, a great collection by a great group, listen and you'll have a great time."
4,My Review,Lot's of good songs. Some I was not familiar with. For the price this purchase was a very good value.
4,Read the book,"I have seen overwhelming evidence to support the fact that ritual abuse cases are caused by organized power and control enforced and perpetuated by various committee members worldwide. I find it disturbing to think that there are still people who believe that such torture and trauma does not indeed exist.I would recommend reading all available information on the topic.It is true that nothing is more horrifying than the thought of our children being in peril, however I would argue that an inability to acknowledge such evils in this world exist is indeed what it ruining inoocent people's lives - the victims of such abuses. Silence and ignorance only perpetuates abuse."
1,A message to anyone who believes in SRA,"I highly suggest that you read ""Satanic Panic: The Creation of a Contemporary Legend,"" as it debunks more effectively than any other book the myth of SRA. That time was a horrible black mark on our history which destroyed many innocent lives, and for the myth to continue to be promulgated is inexcusable."
5,Fairest of Them All,I loved every minute of my reading adventure! It is a must read. You will smile one minute and cry in the next.
1,lord morted,"this is the nu-metal of the dark arts,a damn shame to call this black metal. the bands shock factor is really insulting to say the lease, this band brings eternal shame to the genre...........the diet coke of evil non the less."
4,"Not ""Black Metal"" enough for you? Who care","Honestly I guess this isn't real black metal, it sounds far too good and the production doesn't sound like it was recorded in some losers basement with a playschool tape recorder ala darkthrone, burzum, mayhem, and bathory. Dimmu have recorded a great album with outsanding production. I know they haven't burned down a bunch of churches and killed people but this is a great album none the less."
4,"Good, but still lacking...","I really did like this album and went out of my way to get the digipak version of it as soon as I could. It just doesn't seem to grip me enough and hold me there. This time though, instead of just a string section, they add an entire orchestra from Prague. It really adds even more power and beauty to the songs. Some great moments are here, best song on the album is Progenies Of The Great Apocolypse. Other notables are: For The World To Dictate Our Death, Allhelgens Dd Helveds I Rike (translation: The Death Of All Saints In Hell's Domain), Eradication Instincts Defined and Unorthodox Manifesto (the intro is sweet)."
3,"What Happened With The DVD""s For The Fouth Season of Charmed","I love Charmed, it's one of my favorite shows and as much as I liked the first three seasons with Shannen Doherty playing eldest Halliwell sister Prue I also love the fourth season and the addition of Rose McGowan as younger half-sister Paige Matthews and I was so looking forward to buying the fourth season as it was coming out on February 28, 2006 but I was disappointed when I was told that because of some kind of snafu invovling the supplier that the fourth season was being delayed or cancelled. I hope this is only a temporary thing and that the fourth season will be available soon!"
1,charmed,charmed season 4 is boring and snoring. Only season 1-3 are great. Since shannen is off the show I wont own season 4.I dont care what people say and also dont care wen it ask if it helpful or not and they click no I dont care. I only enjoy season 1-3.
3,No More Shannen Doherty,I have to say i do miss Shannen Dohertyas (Prue) Yes i did order season 4 and iam thinking that's all i might buy but notsure yet. Yes i watch the new show's on WB andyes i do like them but i been a Doherty fan fromBeverly Hills 90210 start and still miss (Prue)Butthat's just me we will see what happen's maybe i willget them all?
3,good season,"after the three season and what happen to prue i think they did a good job on trying to bring the story back. although it do fall off a little bit, but is still good. Season 5 and 6 iswhen things really strats to heat up and also is when my favorite guy comesd in which is chris."
3,Not all I expected,"Too many adds compared to content. Expected more actual gardening compared to cooking and recipes. Did like some of the recipes, just nt what I was looking for."
5,Awesome gardening resource!,"My husband bugged me and bugged me for this magazine...finally it went on sale for $5 for a two year subscription! I quickly ordered it for him, and when our first magazine arrived, I fell in love! I have always been a little interested in gardening, but this magazine has totally expanded my interest in it! I think I like the magazine more than my husband does, and I look very forward to getting future issues!"
4,Magazine - Organic Gardening,"I've subscribed to Organic Gardening for many years. It has helpful information, is inspiring, and has interesting linkups with what people are doing in the field. This helps me as a professional Certified Permaculture Designer living in Georgia."
1,Have not received anything to date,Wonder when I can expect this sub to kick in? Aggravating. Haven't received a verification notice of any kind from OG.
3,Some helpful info but alot of filler,"I do like this magazine and read it cover to cover when it arrives, however, I noticed that since the new editor took over (summer 09), the amount of content related to specific gardening advice has decreased. This content has been replaced by more enviro-social-health information that is available in the other Rodale subscription I have (Bicycling). Since I am looking for a magazine that focuses on gardening I have let my subscription lapse and will be purchasing Fine Gardening this year instead. I bought a copy and it is full of great beginner gardening tips!"
4,Been there and read this!,"I spent many enjoyable days at Bill Haast's amazing reptile attraction as a schoolkid in Florida, and found this book upon returning to Kentucky in the 5th grade. Not only was the book spellbinding, it was really cool to point out to my friends that I had been there in person. Mr. Haast was a spellbinding individual, and his work has saved countless lives and furthered out respect for many reptiles, particularly cobras. If you can afford it, this is a great addition to your library."
3,Mixed reviews,"Honestly speaking, I am a big Incubus fan and always have been since I first heard Hot Dancer. With that in mind, when Incubus crossed over the past 2 albums I never gave up on them. I recently bought ""Crow"" like 2 days ago and was really excited to hear another album but after I throughly listened to ""Crow"" it felt like something was missing. I honestly think every original member of INCUBUS is talented as heck but without the original bassist the sound is flat. When they crossed over with the last two albums I still liked them but ""CROW"" is a let down. There are about 3 songs that DO sound great but 3 songs isn't enough.This is TOTALLY MTV in the making and I can say for the first time that INCUBUS let me down on this one."
2,A change... probably not for the better,"So, for better for worse, Incubus took a huge step backwards with this album. From S.C.I.E.N.C.E. to Make Yourself to Morning View, they slowly progressed to tighter more produced music, losing some of their heaviness in the process. Apparently, somebody decided that this needed to be changed. Someone also apparently locked the produced in the closet, as this entire album sounds like it was recorded in a basement. The songs are much heavier that the previous 2 albums, so if you were a big S.C.I.E.N.C.E fan, you might enjoy that, but it feels like much of the artistry is gone, and all attempt at any backup vocals/harmonies seems to have gone out the window."
3,OK for Incubus,"I totally agree with a previous reviewer when they said that, compared to the mainstream garbage that is all too pervasive today, A Crow Left of the Murder is a great album! But considering Incubus as a group themself, I can only say that their latest work is slightly better than mediocre. They still have that unique vocal sound and hallmark DJ skribbles, but this cd lacks the sense of flow and relaxed feel that Morning View had. I really miss that. I can't cruise in the car with this one.But I DO have a few favorites that I listen to repeatedly from their new album: ""A Crow Left of the Murder"", ""Sick Sad Little World"", and ""Leech"" included. If you're new to Incubus, look elsewhere. If you're into Incubus already, enjoy this one -- it's still good and deserves a place in your collection."
4,Incubus still making waves!,"Someone writing incubus reviews had mentioned that incubus does not have good lyrics, incubus has the most meaningful, contemplative lyrics that listeners can relate to. The new album may be political but still has the old style incubus edge on songs like beware criminal! and does anyone know about the song pantomime? its supposed to be on a crow left of a murder-supposed to be track 15 but mine has only 14 tracks - upto leech."
2,suckubus,"The phrase ""striving for mediocrity"" comes to mind, though Incubus' mediocrity is highly relative. Compared to the slew of indistiguishable pop-punk bands that are currently crawling their way off alt-rock stations and onto MTV, Incubus is far above average. However, compared to what they've done in the past, this album falls short."
4,keep listening,"This album really grows on you. At first, only Megolamaniac and Agoraphobia(best song on the album IMHO) really stood out and I was a little disappointed. However, as with the other Incubus albums, the more that you listen to ACLM the more that you begin to enjoy it. It's a little different, but then if you're an Incubus fan...different is what you should have come to expect from the group. Give this one a chance...it's good stuff, Personal favorites besides the 2 already mentioned: title track, talk shows on mute (the unplugged version on the enclosed DVD is really good), southern girl, and priceless."
5,Amazing,"Alrite so this is Incubus's 5th LP. I bought this cd this afternoon and I haven't stopped listening to it all day. To compare it with their other albums, it's most similar to Make Yourself, but it's better. In my opinion this is Incubus's 2nd best CD, behind their 1997 masterpiece S.C.I.E.N.C.E.I love all of the songs on this CD, and I think Talk Shows On Mute is the best song on the album, but they are all amazing. If you like Incubus you will not be disappointed with this album. A must buy. There is not a weak song on the album. ""Priceless"" is the heaviest song, ""Southern Girl"" is the most mellow. Brandon sings high on many of the songs, Mike's riffs are more amazing and he is better than he was in Morning View, and new bassist Ben makes his presence felt and Jose and DJ Kilmore are always amazing as the most underrated members of the band. Amazing album, great job Incubus.I'd also like to say that this is the best rock album since RHCP's Californication."
2,What happened?,"Incubus make their worst album, primarily because it seems like they didn't really try. On their previous CDs they would cut the fat to make 13 song CDs, but on this one they decided to stop short and put every song on the album. What results is no continuing sound, not very many moments of creativity, and a lot of disappointment. Get Make Yourself, Morning View, SCIENCE, and even Fungus Amoungus before you even download this or unfortunately buy it. Then again, every band has a bad CD eventually.Only songs worth listening to are: Megalomaniac, title track, Talk Shows on Mute, Sick Sad Little World, Zee Deveel, and Here in My Room. The others are trash or skipable tracks."
3,old incubus,Where the hell is Dirk???? Bring back the sound of S.C.I.E.N.C.E. best cd by far. Theres some good songs though.
2,Highly Disappointing ....,"After hearing ""Meglomaniac"" i thought Incubus had a solid album coming. Thought the'y bring back the old sounds from the days of ""Science"" but this album just brought dismal songs that have terrible lyrics and monotone choruses. This CD changed my views on Incubus for the bad and they've wasted to much time on a new approach that just sucks. This CD is alright for 2 songs at best, but I wouldn't recommend it. Only a hardcore Incubus fan might like it."
5,Another Incu-classic!,"A Crow Left Of The Murder is one of the best albums I've ever heard in my life. Unlike Morning View, I didn't have to listen to it ten times, I just loved it right off the bat. There is not a weak song on the album and songs like ""Sad Sick Little World"" and ""Pricless"" almost bring you back to the S.C.I.E.N.C.E. days. If you didn't like Morning View, don't buy this album but true Incu-fans will not be dissapointed."
3,Meh.,"I was excited to get this cd because it was said to be like their old stuff (science), this is not the case however. It is different, but not so much in a good way. I have to say with some of the songs it's like they're just not trying anymore. The lyrics are tame and the melodies are nothing special. There's a few decent songs, and I'm sad to say that it's not worth it to buy it. RIAA complains about people downloading music, but it's cds like this where we SHOULD have the right to download. I would be HEAVILY disapointed if I had paid $15 for a cd like this. Incubus - I'm a fan - but what happened?"
2,A Crow Left of WHAT HAPPENED?!,"As a fan of Incubus who own their albums from Fungus Amongus to the half-dissapointing Morning View...I was CRUSHED when I listened to this album. Usually there are some *good* songs on an album. Ususally the singles are catchy. But this...this is nothing but recycled, unstructred, disorganized (not even like the good disorganiziation of earlier stuff), just plain wretched ""noise."" Even his voice doesn't fit in with all the backround ""music.""I feel that they, after morning view, really deceided to cater to the mtv/trl crowd. And it seems they are eating this up. I feel this is even *worse* (is that even possible?!) than that. But it appears i'm wrong. People like uncatchy horrible VERY VERY VERY unstructured, going nowhere music. I just pray to god, maybe their next album will be filled with songs of talent like they were on their earlier albums. PLEASE!"
1,Don't waste your money...or time downloading it.,"I have become a big fan of Incubus over the past few years, first hearing S.C.I.E.N.C.E, then buying Make Yourself and Morning View. Those CDs were good, and Morning View being the best yet. But this new CD, A Crow...is AWFUL! Megalomanic is ok, but like someone else already stated, it gets worse from there, which isn't good. The vocals don't seem to match the music's tempo and the music sounds recycled and boring. Please, don't waste your money. Buy the single if you like it, but not the whole album. I am very disappointed with this album. No lie, WORST album I have EVER bought! Buy a Thrice album instead."
1,DAH what happened?!,"Well, I bought this cd in spite of the fact that I really don't like the monotone barking that is called ""megalomaniac"", hoping to hear some redeeming musicality on the rest of the cd...Well, there isn't any. The cd was written, recorded, and mixed in four weeks and it's PAINFULLY obvious. Unlike Make Yourself and Morning View (to a certain extent), the songs on ""Crow"" are extremely shallow with none of the subtle musicality that made Make Yourself such a great cd because it kept me listening because there was always more to hear. Unfortunately, Crow lays everything out to hear on the first listen. So, the point is, I'm not sure why anyone would buy this cd, except maybe to hear the political rantings of megalomanic, but you could just listen to or watch that on launch.com."
1,This is the worst 'music' I've ever heard.,"Been an Incubus fan before Fungus Amongus. This album is devoid of anything that could be considered creative. I could sing in a monotonic sort of way like brandon does on almost every song or play the simple guitar riffs that are mind numbing and repetitive. I agree that bands have to evolve and try new things, but this album simply blows. My friend offered to burn the CD for me so I could get an idea of what it was like before buying it, but after hearing how awful it was, I didn't even want him to burn me a copy. They're pretty good in concert--but I would never pay $40-60 to go hear this kind of music. If they want to keep selling albums, they should try being more original and creative, kind of like in morning view or science."
1,Say it Ain't So,"I couldn't believe my ears when I heard this album. I kept trying and trying to accept it, kept trying to ""allow it to grow on me,"" but let's face it...this album blows. Their last three albums were amazing, but I guess all that Backstreet Boy/pop magazine attention got to Brandon's head. Go back to the dreadlocks, grow some balls, and create some good music. Please. Stop trying to impress 13 year old girls, you're better than that."
3,Dissapointment,"The first song is pretty good, then it goes downhill from there. I'm a big Incubus fan but was very dissapointed in the CD. All the songs sound like they were just meant to fill space on the CD. Can anyone tell me another good some besides Megalomaniac?? I doubt it. You can tell they spent 4 weeks on this CD."
4,It grows on ya,"I popped in the cd this morning and thought...well this is OK. But I had faith in the boys from incubus. After about the 4th time around the songs started growing on me. Incubus has definately matured musically. Of course we all miss the good ol' funky days, but this stuff is great too. As I continue to listen to this album, I believe that it will eventually receive 5 stars."
5,Get Real!,"A Crow Left of the Murder is truly a masterpiece. All of you who were looking for a duplicate of Morning View are stupid. This CD is a new horizon for Incubus, obviousley you are not eclectic music fans and are not TRUE INCUBUS fans. This CD marks Incubus as a band whose inovation will be around for years to come. If you were to take the time and listen to the thought and effort to the songs in which were produced you would appreciate the arist mastery that you are listening too. Incubus is the best band around. I feel sorry for you if you believe this CD is just another type of monetary satisfaction. These songs inspire, if you are to nieave to listen to them I feel sorry to call you an Incubus fan!"
1,Make it stop!!!,"If you need an answer as to why every alternative rock station is switching to a smooth jazz or spanish speaking format, look no further than Incubus. Generic pop-rock dressed in trippy lyrics and nu-metal turntables. Gimmie a break!"
2,Five Weeks?!,"Five Weeks to make this album? Are we fans not worth more than five weeks? It's insulting. It's like saying we're puppets and that we'll buy it no matter what sort of garbage they let out. I'm quite disappointed. Love Incubus and fell into the trap of buying it just because it was Incubus. I have every other Incubus album and when I grow to love an artist or group, I am loyal to them and I buy whenever they release assuming that they're work will be good and consistant. This album is immature. It sounds like a bunch of 15 year olds playing with instruments in their garage. Very dissappointed and will not attend this year's tour because I fear that they'll play tracks off of this new album. Hopefully this isn't the end of my long time fanship of Incubus. Hopefully they recover with their next album and hopefully we fans will be worth a bit more time than five weeks."
4,"Not quite what I expected, but it is growing on me....","Okay, let me get this comment out of the way....it is unbelievable how much this band reminds me of Faith No More. But to me, this is not a bad thing. Incubus' songs are unique and are their own, but I can really hear the FNM influence, especially on 'Zee Deveel'.I love the lyrics in Megolomaniac....I wish the Bush administration, and everyone who supports it, would actually listen and let the lyrics change their ways....if I met Bush in a scissor fight I would definitely ""cut off both your wings on principle alone"". What a great lyric.....the album is definitely worth buying."
4,Good,I'm not fond of some of the songs but I've leared over the years that some of Incubus' songs have to grow on me. Brandon's vocals are outstanding.
5,Incubus keeps growing,"First off, let me say that I think the new Incubus album is great. They're are doing their own thing, mixed with homages to Rush, Pearl Jam, etc.Secondly, Incubus is growing up, the style of their music has changed with this. One cannot expect them to appeal to teenagers for the rest of their career. It's not fair to call them a sell out.I suggest you go out and buy this album if you are an Incubus fan, you will not be disappointed."
2,Not so great..,"ok, to their credit, incubus shows alot of creativity and can still kick-ass musically. the problem with this cd is that the songs are too obtuse, starting off well, but eventually turning into a tortured mess by the bridge, only to return to the over played chorus one last time. not every single song follows this structure, but its enough that it becomes rather annoying. its really hard to listen to this record from start to finish, and its easy to feel like this is a giant leap backwards from Morning View, where i think they reached their pinnacle as a band. don't get me wrong, i still love incubus and a few songs on here; (most notably ""Talk Show On Mute"", ""Southern Girl"", ""A Crow Left Of The Murder"", ""Sick Sad Little World"") are actually pretty good. I understand the vision, but these guys really need to focus the songs and work out their delivery to make this style work."
1,This CD makes a nice coaster,"""A Crow Left of the Murder"" belongs in the trash can. It doesn't deserve to have four stars...there's simply no way I can get into this album. I don't really like ANY of the songs on the CD, Megalomaniac and Beware Criminal! are the only two worth a halfhearted mention. It's hard to believe that after a marvelous album like Morning View, this is all Brandon and Co. can come up with on the next go-round.Hopefully, Incubus won't try to ""go back to their roots"" again. Ignore all the biased reviews by the tried-and-true Incubus fans, if all you're looking for is good music by this band check out Morning View or Make Yourself."
1,latest band to turn to the dark side,"science, make yourself, and morning view are all great albums. a crow left of the murder doesnt even deserved to be mentioned in the same sentence with those. incubus has clearly fallen to into the black hole of artists who change their style to fit pop culture. simple bass lines and ridiculously basic guitar riffs throughout leave the listener bored even the first time through the album. this is most unfortunate because incubus was one of the few bands left around that hadnt sold itself out. the lone bright spots are tracks 1 and 8, but overall its not even worth listening to."
2,I tried and tried,"I had others tell me of Mr. Ward, and they pushed me to buy this and told me it would chenge my outlook on poetry. If it does, I'm not seeing it. Seems like something more important to him than it applies to me. Isn't that what poetry should do?"
4,A Quite Successful Book from an Under-Recognized Poet,"I bought this book by Ward years ago at a reading he gave in Syracuse. I was surfing around to see if he had anything new in and saw so many negative reviews. I was startled. This is quite a beautiful book full of tender and sorrowful lyricism. The title, riffing Neruda, is ironic, as underneath the surface texture of these poems is a fear of loss as much as renewal.In the chaos of my library I have my top book shelf of about 30 books of contemporary poets that I find jumpstart me when I have trouble writing. This book is on there. Ward is part of my generation of poets (born at 1965 or after), but he has somehow fallen through the seams. He should be present in the canon forming anthologies but isn't. This is a shame.I highly recommend Ward, his work, and if you get the chance-- to hear him read. The honest and seemingly simple texture and metaphor of his poems offers us much to help us live our lives."
5,A Work of Art,B.J Ward is now presently teaching at my middle school in NJ. I am fascinated with his thoughts and insights in class. I think schools across the country should get poetry programs in their school and if possible have BJ Ward teach them. He is a huge influence on peoples lives and I hope some day everybody will recognize his talents.
1,Do NOT buy this phone,"This is the most annoying phone ever. Simple tasks are made difficult, with programming codes, etc. It is almost impossible to hear people talking. The volume on the answering machine can not muted. The worst thing of all is that the phone lets out an annoying beep every hour on the hour as it checks for voice mail messages. ** Even if it is free, do not get this phone. **"
3,Book,"This is an interesting perspective as is the title, the book reflects the storyline of, ""The Politically Incorrect Guide to American History."""
1,Voice of Dissent on Thomas Woods' Book.,"Although a little bit of truth manages to ooze out from between the pages of Thomas Woods' book, the book also is filled with unrestrained historical revisionism and gross distortions of facts. Historical accuracy and biased political ideology seldom combine to make objective historical analysis. Indeed right wing conservatives like Woods and David Duke resort frequently to skewing historical facts just like left wingers do, to support their ideologies."
2,"Long on Opinion, Short on History.","I'll probably get alot of flak from all my friends that like to complain about the rewriting of history that has taken place of late, but I didn't really like this book.I think the arguments in it were specious, and in many cases circular. His research seems hit or miss and based almost entirely on conjecture instead of cold hard facts.He quotes the opinions of people extensively, which is great when trying to discover intent (as in the case of the Bill of Rights). But opinions don't really do that much good if you are refuting a claim based on facts (as in the case of say black soldiers fighting for the south during the war between the states).I give it a two, I would have given it a three, but I was so heavily disappointed that it turned out to be a diatribe rather than an actual refutation of PC history."
1,Typical jingoist revisionism,"The history of America goes like this according to this guy1)The original American revolutionaries were ""conservatives"", nevermind that the Torries and Loyalists were the true conservatives2)The Civil War was not over slavery, but because of the Union's unfair taxation3)Blacks and whites in the South were actually really good friends and got along great4)The Native Americans weren't really kicked off their land5)FDR didn't actually get us out of the Depression and sold us out to the Japanese6)Joseph McCarthy was a great man7)And my personal favorite, Ronald Reagan single-handedly won the Cold WarIf you're a simple mind with a ""Support Our Troops"" sticker on your pickup truck and you get worried when a Filipino family moves in nextdoor to you than this book is right up your alley."
1,Make that the Incorrect Guide to American History,"A right-wing diatribe unsupported by facts, combined with crackpot philosophy.Under FDR, employment rose more than 5% per year, yet this author actually claims that unemployment rose under Roosevelt. What color is the sky in his world?Oh, and did you know that all public works projects are invalid because they do not incorporate entrepreneurial profit-loss motive? You've heard of the Hoover Dam, the Interstate Highway System, public utilities, and airports? Yep, that's right, none of them should have been built! This author professes to admire the Puritans, and if he had his way, we'd still be living like them!"
2,For Home School Student to borrow from Library,Interesting concepts are presented but lack any scholarly documentation. I had considered having one of our students read the book but after reading it myself am returning it to the library as there is no evidence presented that what the book presents as facts are backed up by actual citations.It might be a good starting off place for a research paper to see if a grade school student could outdo a Ph.D.
2,Don't put all your eggs in this basket,"This book has about 20% of the exam included. All subject areas covered in the book will appear on the test, but the book may only have a bold faced reference and no other information. I would NOT recommend using this book as your sole study source. I passed the test on the first try (had to make a 500 for full credit even though the ACE score is 420), but I wouldn't credit this book. If you use it as a sole source, you'll be sorry, if you use it in conjuction with other study material, you should pass."
1,Not helpful at all.,"I just took the Social Science Clep Examination. The book was not helpful at all. First of all the material in the book is not current. The tests are computerized. There were not any tips or imformation on the computerized types of CLEP tests. Though there is alot of information in the book, I did not find any of it relevant at all to the exam. The book itself was made really well. I used it daily for about a month and it is in perfect condition."
2,ATT 9357,The display on my phone also went bad after a short time. Sounds like a universal issue with this particular phone. Other than that it was pretty good.
2,"junk, dont buy","I have a dual sub box and needed one more subwoofer for it. my other one was red so i based the purchase kinda on the color and watts instead of brand. big mistake. for a week it sounded really good with the other sub but that was it. whenever i had sub connected it would send the amp into protect mode and after doing a few test the sub was blown already. next time ill spend the extrta cash on it, you definitly get what you pay for on this one but even with $10 more you can get a decent one that last."
2,SJ Namo WebEditor 6 Suite,"When I first started using this program I thought it was great but when I had trouble with the text wrap, I couldn't fix it. There were large spaces between words and when I tried to pull the words together they all bunched up with no spaces. Everytime I deleted them and started over the same problem came up. When I tried to publish, it just wouldn't do it and when I finally did get it to publish, it published only parts of the website with blank places on the pages. The spell checker did not catch all of the misspelled words either. There is no on line support for this program and it is full of bugs. I uninstalled it and purchased FrontPage 2003 and have had no more problems. I do not recommend this program. It does have lots of nice Themes but they will not publish. The price is right but the product is not."
5,Thousands of Practice Questions and Simulations,"This book contains thousands of multiple choice questions and quite a few simulations. I am using it in addition to a Becker review course. It has some of the same questions as the Becker material (probably 30 percent), but there are many questions not included in Becker, and some of them have a very different focus and style. I think this makes the book worth the $60 price, just to fill in the gaps. If you are not using a review course, the Wiley reviews are also recommended, individually or in the four volume set."
1,Does not fit the 2004 Lancer ES,"Amazon will tell you that this filter will fit the 2004 Lancer ES, but it does not. Who knows, perhaps I got a defective unit, but it is about a 1/4 inch too big to fit. The plastic mold to hold the filter was also warped. I returned this item and will try my luck with a different one."
2,Don't waste your money,"This album is bland vanilla pop rock and could be by anybody. It doesn't have the distinctive PBF sound we love them for. I deleted all but 3 songs from my library, and am not even sure I'm keeping those. By the way, if you like PBF, make sure you've got Hit List by Heart Throb Mob."
5,Excellent Product!,My hairstylist suggested this product to me to use as styling gel and I have loved it! It not only has worked great for styling my hair but has really kept my hair soft and healthy looking!
5,This Is A Delightful Movie For Young And Old!!!,"In this movie we see Prince Charming and his sidekick played by Martin Short who are sentenced to a ""frogging"" in Medieval England. One soon learns that they should have chosen a flogging instead. As an aside I have heard that some guys are ""into"" that sort of thing. Prince Charming and his friend end up in Modern Day New York where they get a horse and carriage ride with Christina Applegate who is a delight to watch as always. Christina thinks that these two are a couple of eccentric losers because of their continual reference to Central Park as being ""Cental Forest"" which is a funny joke in itself. However she soon changes her mind when the Prince pays her with a very valuable Antique coin. This movie is a gem for young and old and I believe I have too much class to attack another reviewer's opinion of this movie."
5,Bawdy laughter for all,"This movie captured the heart of the whole family, even though it has strong sexual overtones occasionally. Martin Short is one of my all time favorite actors and Christina Applegate finally helped me like her acting ability in this heartwarming tale of a Prince that is turned into a Frog because of his own sexual deviancy on his wedding day. Not to mention the Prince is incredibly handsome. I have watched it four more times and each time is as funny as the last."
1,At least he's honest about it...,"Excerpt:"" But it is dominion we are after. Not just a voice.It is dominion we are after. Not just influence.It is dominion we are after. Not just equal time.It is dominion we are after.World conquest. That's what Christ has commissioned us to accomplish. We must win the world with the power of the Gospel. And we must never settle for anything less...Thus, Christian politics has as its primary intent the conquest of the land -- of men, families, institutions, bureaucracies, courts, and governments for the Kingdom of Christ.""The only way I'd recommend this book is if you're doing research on how crazy some people can be."
1,Almost unreadable,"I can't comment on the quality of the contents because I couldn't (or more to the point, wouldn't) read this book. Sorry, but just because you have a computer and ""Wow, lookit all these cool fonts!"" does NOT make you a graphic designer. The font used for the primary text is so light in weight and diminuative that trying to read it is annoying and uncomfortable. If you have eagle-like eyesight, fine. I'm sending this back to the seller."
3,Classy watch.,"It has a retro look, very stylish, yet it's design is unlike any other watch. I had some reservations due to the curved face and raised crystal, but after wearing this watch daily, I became less worried of damaging it. What I found strange was that you cannot find the Gramercy watch on the Hamilton web site. Is this a discontinued model? Who knows, but it's still a fine watch."
1,Embarrassing,"This book was just a major disappointment. The subject is superb, perhaps the true golden age of baseball, but Roger Kahn ruined it with his windy political opinons. Mr. Kahn seems almost confrontational with his political views, and seems unable to present any baseball history without them. I finally stopped reading it about a fifth of the way through and am very sorry I bought it. Read ""Dynasty"" and ""Bums"" by Peter Golenbock for real history. Don't waste your money on this stinker."
2,Flimsy,"The filter arrived partially smashed...I assume it was from shipping. The pleats were not intact. When I put it in place, the pleats collapsed. What's the purpose of pleats if they are not funtional? Compared to other similar items that cost the same or less, the filter is very generic...not well made."
3,"ok, but","its alright. the unit generation system could use some work and some of the more famous merc units are not even mentioned (where's the 15th Dracon, or big MAC). however, listing of wages and expenses is very useful."
1,Very poorly written,"The stories and accounts (and gossip) in this book are presented very poorly. The organization of the book is incoherent and the author is not presenting the stories with an unbiased eye. He frequently engages in critical assessments of the women in the affairs as ""beautiful"" or ""ugly,"" ususally presented as his opinion instead of what others' accounts of the women actually were. His sources of information are dubious and highly suspect. I really would not suggest this book at all. This is a very interesting subject given by an author with a complete lack of story-telling ability."
4,IBS/Regulan,"I have only been taking this for the past few weeks, but it has shown some results. Anything is better than nothing. I look forward to the full effect in the near future."
1,Disappointing,"Anyone familiar with the Carmilla story already knows it involves a beautiful female vampire aiming her sights on the pretty daughter of the local squire --- pretty sexy stuff! But Amarantha Knight wants to jazz it up, which is fine. The two girls engage in some hot dominance & submission, with spankings and lesbian sex --- I'm all for it! But WHY does the author then feel compelled to add everybody else in the household?!! The father, the neighbors, the visitors from Ohio, the local sock merchant, etc. etc. etc. Eventually, it just gets too crowded, and an erotic story turns into everyone doing everyone. But it's just not erotic --- it's BORING!!! It got to the point where I never even finished my copy. Better to turn on the TV and watch Baywatch re-runs."
5,Brio Dachshund Pull Toy,Quality Classic Brio Dachshund Pull Toy has always been a favorite of my children! Well-made and excellent creative design. This is a colorful and endearing little Dachshund! Tolerant and safe for play with toddlers. This is a wonderful addition to any quality toy collection.
2,Wasn't what I thought,"I was so excited when I bought this ironing board for my daughter. When we got it home and out of the package it was so short. The pakaging makes you beleive that the child can stand up and iron. My daugther has to sit on her knees to use it and she is only 2 years old! Don't be fooled by the packaging, they have the board sitting on a table. I tried that too. It was very hard to find the right sized table to sit it on. Most made it too high. I wouldn't recomend this product to others."
4,My daughter loves this ironing set,"My daughter got this set for Christmas when she had just turned 2. She is 3 1/2 now and she still plays with it every time I am ironing. We like the fact that it is small because she can carry it from room to room by herself, and since it folds up, it doesn't take up much room in the closet. No, the iron doesn't make any noises, but it's a pretend toy, and our daughter just uses her imagination. It has held up well for us, even with her 19 month old sister falling on it occasionally."
1,Child's ironing board,Quality and size were very inadequate and had to send back. I had purchased this product for my 5-year-old granddaughter and it just didn't fit the bill especially for what I paid for it.
5,makes you wanna sing !!,This is an excellent collection of Christian songs that make you want to sing along. The various artists and their lyrics are beautiful and inspiring.
3,"Good, but not great....","I thought this book was fine, it really focuses on all aspects of software requirements. I would recommend it higher if you represent an IS department making a software purchase. I rate it a 3 for product management and program managers in a software development environment."
4,At last it all becomes clear.,"Goodbye Real. Hello Windows Media. Finally I found the answers to all my technical questions in this extremely well put together book about Microsoft's Windows Media Technologies. As well as all the technical stuff (i.e. what it can and can't do) there's lots of useful realworld applications and fictional case studies. All in all, it's pretty damn inspiring and gives me the confidence to use Windows Media technologies for all our streaming media requirements.I picked this book up at Streaming Media West at the Microsoft stand. Well done and thanks chaps!"
3,Who Broke his damn heart?,"I first saw him in his mothers video, then I saw him in his video. Then I saw him on sat. doing this interview. I love his charm, his sensitivity, his honesty. his gift and love of that beautiful piano., also his big bold eyes with all that expression. Whenever I hear the begining of his video I drop what Im doing and lock onto him . I float away with him, I can really feel him in my heart. God has truly unveiled a Black Man with spiritual power and lyrics. He is just coming up on the front to connect with those who can hear the Word. God is using soft love to bring down the enegy that is trying to take over our minds and hearts. Sit down and listen, and you will know what i am saying. Mario I send to you my heart. Much love to you and your mom! sister angela brown (561 848-2920)"
4,The story of my heart (for real!!),"I first heard his single back in '97 titled I don't know, and from that point on I looked for his full album release... There are several tracks on this cd that I could call ""my favorite"". I suggest strongly that if you don't have this cd, you might want to get it if you're interested in having a meaningful R&B collection. I too am aspiring to be a singer, songwriter, and producer, and I must say that I was strongly influenced by his style and smoothness. Go get it!!!"
4,Copernicus - Jumbo Magnifying Glass,"Excellent magnifying glass. HUGE! I bought it for reading. It's easy to follow the typed words and not get lost. The frame is plastic and a bit flimsy, so be careful with it. Don't Drop It!!! It'll crack at handle and will need to be superglued."
2,Not as nice as I would have expected.,"I got the first of 4 of these I ordered today. And, the diamond chips do not show up the way I've had diamond chips show up in other sterling jewelry. So, I'm a bit disappointed. I did get it at the extra 70% off, so I won't return the ... but I won't give them as a showcase gift to children, but instead along with something else. I think the chain seems rather durable, and in that regard, I think it will work well for kids."
5,Gyros rotary tool routing bits,"I purchased these bits to create borders to my wood carvings using my Gyros rotary tool. The product is good, bits are sharp and small, as expected for a Dremel type tool. Nice purchase. They leave a clean cut, but I recommend doing three passes to complete the job. You will need a routing table (mine is home made) or a router plunge adapter."
4,Be Aware,"The product was great. It is well designed and sturdy. And it fits a void in the market that needs to be filled. But I made a mistake of assuming that compatibility with a ""Sears Contractor"" model was the same as compatibility with a Craftsman Professional model. So just be aware that these two models from Sears are not the same design and this unit is not compatible with the Craftsman Professional. I had to return my purchase. I do want to commend Amazon.com for their excellent return policies and ease of doing so. They are great to buy from."
1,organic hybrid? I think not!,How can this rice be organic if it's hybrid?? That's not possible. This rice is GMO!!!
2,Doesn't Work with Windows XP,"Never got a chance to try it. Didn't seem to work on Windows XP. Seems like it might be good for kids, but not a very acedemic piece of work."
1,Makes no sense to have something in birdbath that can't get wet!,This product makes no sense...it's very difficult to keep something in a birdbath from getting wet. Mine got wet in a recent rain (the water level got too high) and no longer works now that it's dried out. A waste of money...who has time to predict the weather and rescue the water wiggler from every rain?
3,IT WORKS,"This works well, sometimes the wiggler drops out but not too tricky to put back in the hole, this does run 24-7. The birds are getting use to it, I don't see that it draws more birds yet, scared the birds at first.I worry what will happen if it gets knocked over? etc. 2 D batteries in it. I guess it will just short out? Really no clue which bothers me, and no answer in the info sent, don't want to electrocute anybody. The birds don't bath in the bird bath, which is large, they do drink.Too pricey for what it is but Amazon had free shipping so that helps. Really not thrilled with it. I had a milk jug filled with water with a pin hole punched in it hanging over the bath that drew more birds. We birders might just want to save our $35 bucks for bird seed? And hang a free empty milk jug on a tree limb over the bath, covered mine with a basket. Happy birding!!"
1,Wrong Photo,Portmeirion Pomona Earthenware Cookie JarThe apple design that is shown is not the cookie jar. They reversed the photos of the cookie jar and the bread crock. The photo of the bread crock (the apricot) is the cookie jar. I called customer service so another person doesn't get the wrong item.
1,Bought it and do not like it.,The sound quality of this CD is boo boo. I spent [$] and expected Outkast type sound quality but that didn't happen. Anyway the cd is okay conceptually but the sound stinks.
1,Disappointed,The practice exam was Ok but the text did not help answer the questions that were on the actual exam. I had to buy another book to find out about the more difficult questions. The illustrations were vague and their was minimal preparatory value.
4,Amazing album.,"I first heard of Smetana from a fellow heavy metal fan. I am into metal, such as Iron Maiden and Blind Guardian (to name only two), and I never really considered classical music as something I would like. When I was 14 years old, I was introduced to Die Moldau (Vltava), and it has since become one of my favorite songs of all time. The whole album has some special feel about it, especially Tabor and Die Moldau. I am simply blown away by this.I would say, if you're into classical music, particularly Chopin or Wagner, and have not yet heard of Smetana, you must get this album. If you're a heavy metal fan, I would highly suggest you give this album a try. I would recommend anyone to at least give this album a try."
5,Good remixes,"I liked very much every track.""Dancing with tears in my eyes (Extended version)"" is very good.I always look for extended versions and this CD you can find good extended versions."
5,Great collection of mixes,Great music in a different mix. Unfortunately all great songs are not included on the disc.
5,I wish Zhane would get more attention & praise.......,"because they are the best female r&b duo out there. These sistas can truly sing. Their songs are breathtaking and the melody is just great. I saw them perform live many times and every time they were very good. They need to get a better A&R team because it's a disgrace that these two aren't bigger than what they are. Their first album was terrific too. I still listen to it and it's about 6 or 7 years old now. If anyone reading this review does not have an album by them, then go out and get both of them!"
2,There Are Better Guidebooks for Japan,"I guess like most other people, I bought this guide due to Lonely Planet's reputation, but I ended up dumping this guide after about a month of my three year stay in Japan. The maps aren't accurate at all, and the coverage is a mixed bag at best. I ended up switching to the ""New Japan Solo"" guidebook which is the best guidebook for Japan in my opinion. I recommend checking that one out before you drop you money on this one."
4,Lonely Planet Japan was my bible,"Despite a few short-comings (maps that are far too small and lack detail) I found many interesting sites and places to stay through this book... And much helpful advice.I also appreciated the little history lesson associated with some locations; in a country full of mystery (and some weirdness), this book helped decipher much of what was going on.Of note, check out the bar called MAC in Hiroshima and be amazed at the CD collection! It's in the book."
3,out of date,This is an excellent book but this printing (7th edition) is 3 years out of date. Wait for an update before purchasing or get a more up to date guide altogether if you are in a hurry.
2,Don`t waste your money!,"I have purchased this used one time and send it back I have 6 quart kitchen aid mixer, 575 W. first of all it takes a lot of time to grind even one cup of grain and mixer becomes overheated very fast. After returning this product I purchased wonder mill for $ 250.00 Works great!"
1,great disappointment,"The mill was advertised as fitting all models of Kitchen Aid mixers. I have two mixers--an Artisan & a Classic model, and the mill fits neither. The fitting is too large; therefore, the attachment doesn't lock in place. Has anyone else who purchased the mill had this difficulty? My first, and last, attempt at using the mill ended with wheat berries being flung far and wide across my kitchen. This is the 2nd time in less than a year that Kitchen Aid has GREATLY disappointed me with a product. The mixers are fantastic--but my satisfaction ends there! The mill is going to have to be returned. Question is, will I find one that DOES fit?"
1,Very slow and loud.,"I was disappointed in that this is so loud and slow. It was easy to put together and use. I feel unsafe that it's aluminum, but that's known prior to purchasing. I have only used it twice and have already wondered if I'm going to sell it or just give it away."
5,great tool and great customer service,"I used it last season, it worked great. I pulled it out of the shed this spring and realized that the lever is missing. So I cannot squeeze and spray the liquid. I searched and searched, have no idea how it would dis-connect and where it would go. Called the Chapin customer service and without any question the lady just took my name and address and said it will be in the mail. No charge. Nice!"
5,Great value for the price,"The sprayer is excellent as far as structure and workability, but I do wish it was bigger. The trigger is well built and hopefully will last several years. We bought our last one at Home Depot and the trigger was cheap and quickly fell apart."
3,Wouldn't buy again,"For the price I think this works OK, but I regret not having spent a little more on a better sprayer. The spray tip is adjustable, however it doesn't allow you to get a good 'mist' spray as my other spray with a metal wand. I was also disappointed that it had no pressure relief valve, so if you need to open it, you have to spray out all the pressure first. If you want something that works OK for little money, then this is your sprayer. I'll probably just use it for spraying pesticide but use my other sprayer for lawn/garden jobs."
4,Rockstar/Superstar Paperback Book,This book was for a school project for my daugher and we had trouble getting it at our local book store. The book came very fast and she was able to get her project done before it was due.
3,Abridged Version,"This version has has omitted some very powerful and crucial scenes, from 196 minutes to 122 minutes, which leaves out more than an hour of the original movie. The ending was particularly disappointing because it had originally been so beautifully and creatively done, and was the culmination was eleven years of grueling work to integrate the personalities. Why on earth anyone would choose to remove this scene is beyond me. Other scenes had been omitted or cut to the point they weren't fully explained, so while it was still a good movie for someone who's never seen the original, I feel that the high prices on this severely edited version are not warranted."
5,Sybil,If I were to award a film for best acting this would be it. The story line has a huge WOW factor - highly recommend for good viewing.
5,"Great movie, that worthy of a remake",I look everywhere for this movie and i am glad that they finally made it into a DVD. If they were to recast the part of the mother I hope Sally Fields would consider playing the role of the mother.
5,Sybil,A well done film version of this tragic story. I am studying advanced psychology and this film served as a good teaching tool; giving an indepth insight into the dark recesses of mental illness.
2,Fluffy - not valuable information,"This book is too clichéd! Everything is described so briefly. I hesitate to call is succinct because it really doesn't delve deep into the culture. The topics covered are very superficial and it makes the culture look very transparent.The book just barely gives you enough information to be a tad bit familiar with French culture but by all means will not prepare you for any immersion into French culture.I've seen worse books than this, though. But there are better ones out there."
1,For Dispenser only,"I thought I was getting 6 500ML bottles, but these are refill bags for dispensers. ""Sanitizer"" alcohol gels are a great product and should be more widley used. Its frustrating how difficult it is to buy in quantity"
5,lots of knowledge information,"I love this book it has beautiful pictures, lots of information on everything. I would recomend to to any bird owner..."
1,Where's the full season???,"The show is a definite 5-star rating, however this DVD and the distributor gets a big fat ONE!Why do such terrible shows as The Nanny, Too Close For Comfort, Soap, etc get full season releases yet this gem does not?Unforgivable!"
2,Not what we remembered.,I suppose it's been too long since we watched this series on TV. Some if it is very funny. Much is just bad taste.
2,Disappointing,"First off let me say that I love Designing Women and I was really happy when they released the DVD. However, I wanted to be able to see the really funny shows, like the one when Julia gets her head stuck in the bannister or the one where Charlene gives birth to Olivia. This had episodes that were memorable but unfunny. These episodes dealt with serious situations that were socially conscious, but could you please include something that is going to make me laugh after I feel depressed? Call me shallow, but I would rather laugh than cry at a show that is supposed to be funny. I would prefer the whole season coming out on seperate sets than a few shows at once."
5,Great fun for the hole family,"Bought 5 of these for Christmas,everybody loved them.Great fun with lots of people.all ages can play.Had problems with one,returned it,new one showed up in 3 days. Amazon is great with returns."
3,Good Book - Terrible Writing and Poor Attention to Detail,"This book covers pretty much all electronic components used in industry today with many great examples and applications. This IS NOT a book for novices in the subject material. I like the information and array of topics covered in the book as a whole. However, the grammar and attention to detail are quite terrible. I find myself shaking my head every other page reading typos and mis-labeled figures. Fortunately, I have not been assigned any of the problems so I cannot attest to whether the problems refer to accurate figures, etc. as another reviewer mentioned.Overall Opinion: Great Idea and Coverage but Terrible writing and organization"
3,comprehensive view of marketing in the grocery business,"First off, let me state that this is by no means a book meant for light reading. It was assigned to me as part of Professor Kahn's (the author) Introduction to Marketing lecture at the University of Pennsylvania. Although not the primary text used in class, the Grocery Revolution provides a comprehensive view of the grocery business. It thoroughly discussed the marketing mix (product, price, place, and promotion). Although the book covers everything very well, it tends to become very repetitive, with the same examples cited over and over. Also, there is a huge presence of numbers and percentages from various studies that become overwhelming after a while. The book, however, does provide a very good view of the whole marketing mix in one industry. It is a good book to use as an example for a concrete view of the basic marketing concepts."
3,Lil Tike picnic table,"I found this item very ""tricky"" to set up. The picture shows easy assembly but it is actually difficult to get the table to stand without falling. Theer are two red tabs that must be inserted underneath the table and they must be inserted properly or else the table falls. I was truly dissapointed with this item. It is not sturdy and in my personal opinion not very safe."
3,"Great concept, lacks ease of use","The table itself fits great in the kitchen but it has proven to be very difficult to open and fold properly, leaving it unstable. My children, 1 weighing 40 pounds and 1 weighing 26 pounds have used this for only a few weeks for their snacks, not for climbing on, and yet the support for the seat has cracked in 2 places. Wish it was easier to use and more durable, will be replacing it with a different product."
3,Never again!!,I don't like this table set...I searched around for awhile. And made a bad choice.When I set it up...my son sat in it..like normal. And then flipped backwards towards the floor! (I caught him)The benches set to close to the table. And the bottom of the benches should have had skid guards or something.I'm trying to return it and get the chair/table combination instead.
3,Pinic Table,This is a ok picnic table for little ones. I am kind of disappointed that the seats pop off to easy. I do like this table but wish the seats could be more secure.
4,Good Purchase,"My daughter is 19 months old and I needed a table for lunch and crafts... Saw this at a friends house and my daughter loved to sit at it.We call it her big girl table and she loves to sit and eat lunch and color. The only wierd thing is that the table top shifts slightly, left to right.. It is very slight, but a bit annoying. It is very portable, we move it from our porch to the living room. Highly recommend it."
2,Truly Disappointed,"I truly am not impressed with this book. I ordered and received it this week, needless to say, the best part about this book is its timely arrival. Many of the patterns are a bit unappealing. I would not wear them nor make for anyone I know and love. I do not recommend it at all. To its credit, I will say, there are possibly a total of 3 patterns which I found attractive and worthy of attempting to make. Sorry everyone but I call it like I see it. That's my opinion."
2,Doesn't worked a penny,The CD does not seems original. Songs do not seem to match the title. Son sound good on line but when you get the CD is totally different.
5,A MUST Have!!!!,"If you like Bon Jovi, you will LOVE this video!! It contains unreleashed videos of ""Living in Sin"", ""Dry County"", and many more. It depicts the transition from the ""80's glam rock / heavy metal"" to the 90's rock flavor. I own almost everything Bon Jovi has done, and this is well worth the money! It has more videos on it than any other videos I own. A MUST HAVE!!!"
5,The Best of the Bon Jovi Band,"Crossroads is one of the best videos the Bon Jovi Band has to date. I received this one about 2 years ago in VHS format and watch it every weekend. I'm a true Bon Jovi Fan. All of the videos capture the essence of what this band is all about. Rock 'N Roll-they rock, they roll, and they show another side of themselves and the Band as a whole in this video. I think someone mentioned that Living In Sin is not on it. They may not have watched the whole video because it is definitely there and it's great. I highly recommend this video for any hardcore Bon Jovi Fans. Looking for it in DVD Format, if anyone has it yet, please let me know. Thank you."
4,Bon Jovi- the best of...could be better,"This is a good video, it contains all of their best videos except ""Living In Sin,"" ""Born To Be My Baby,"" ""Stranger In This Town,"" & ""Ballad Of Youth."""
5,Great tuner,"This FAST Air/Fuel meter is one of the best tools I have bought lately. Works Great, and is easy to install. Makes jetting a carburetor Simple. Very Useful machine."
1,shameless self-promotion?,"Why so many five-star reviews from ""A Customer""? I don't own the book, but so many 5-star reviews from the same reviewer screams: ""Stay away from this book"" to me. Amazon: Please limit the number of reviews from a single account to one per listing--and allow reviewers to UPDATE their review, but not add another."
2,When will Arthaus Musik Deliver the complete series?,"As far as I know there is not a complete DVD series of Dvorak's nine symphonies, let alone works where Dvorak used the orchestra to support soloists. I started buying these DVD recordings some years ago in the expectation that RM Artists and Alte Oper Frankfurt (where these works were recorded) would bring out the complete set within a reasonable time. These DVD recordings appear to have been made in 1993, which makes them almost 20 years old, and also somewhat overpriced.Prospective buyers might like to ask Arthaus Musik when the complete set will be released. I am still waiting on a reply from them!Brian Merrett"
3,Deviled Egg Platter,"I love the chill factor on this egg dish. Its great for a buffet. but I didn't like the lid and the ""handle"" is just a waste of time. You can't carry it worth a darn with the handle. It just falls off. I like the dish, but wish it was portable than it is."
3,Didnt hold up for my dog,"This is a pretty cool design in that it bounces, floats and takes an unpredictable path; but my dog (english mastiff) had peices of it all over the floor after on few minutes of chewing on it. The seach continues to try to find a toy for him that will last. Given the reputation this ball and other peoples reviews I would have to recommend it for a try; but to call it indestructible is like saying the USA doesn't have a debt problem."
4,the geographies of law,"This book and especially Roger Cotterrell`s insights, can be very usefull to reveal what I call (following geographer Nick Blomley) the geographies of law, that is, all those representations of space that they are concealed in legal world, and the sociological viewpoint can help to understand.For example, a legal concept of Community (like Cotterrell`s used)it is very practical for an epistemological approaching to allow undestand all the complex social processes related about law that emerges in the context of globalization and in it's materialization exceed the classical concept of ""society"" identified within the Nation-State`s idea.(apologies for my english).Julio Antonio Díaz Cruz, Mexico."
1,I HATE THE 4 TOPS!,"I hate the 4 Tops. When I was a very little girl, I would say, ""Turn off Sugar Pie! I hate Sugar Pie because it's bad!"" There is nothing the 4 Tops do that sounds good to me. I HATE THEM! There was a boy in my old neighborhood who satirized the atrocious ""Ain't No Woman Like the One I've Got"" to ""Ain't No Woman Like the One-Eyed Clod."" Although his apt parody was very funny, the song still stinks and I HATE THE 4 TOPS! BOO, HISS! I DETEST THEIR SOUND AND STYLE!"
5,MOTOWNS BEST MALE ACT!,"The Four Tops were arguably Motowns very best all male act. Lead singer Levi Stubbs rocketing voice remains as stunning as ever and is complemented on this timeless collection of their most soulful, emotionally charged hits. Amongst the best tracks included on this compilation includes their pair of U.S no.1 hits - I CAN'T HELP MYSELF and the unforgetable REACH OUT I'LL BE THERE as well as STILL WATERS RUN, BERNADETTE, STANDING IN THE SHADOWS OF LOVEand BABY I NEED YOUR LOVING. This excellent vocal group were tremendously talented and their work remains unique. With this collection featuring classic after classic its a must have. Highly recommended!!!"
2,the ultimate collection has shortcomings...,"Buyer beware, both the Supremes and the Four Tops ""Ultimate Collections"" are difficult to listen to. It seems the remastering process left these CD's sounding slightly distorted and harsh on the ears. It's a huge shame because the song selection here is phenomenally good. The recent Millenium collection is too skimpy, and the Essential Collection from RCA leaves out 7 Rooms of Gloom. Unless one wants to shell out more cash for the 4 disc box set, i would suggest getting the anthology CD, even the old version. The remastering may sound weaker but it beats sounding distorted."
1,"No music, very little animation",This video was a reading of the book instead of the fully animated version with the catchy music that I remember seeing as a child.
5,Great for what it is,"This integrated handel water carrier is far better than the old style external handle model. The old style was not durable and would pull off unless supported underneath while carrying.You have to be reasonable about how you are going to use this product. If you plan to slide it or drop it on the ground it will not work for you. It will get leaks. If you are carefull and want collapsible water containers that are lightweight and easy to pack, this is the ticket."
1,Leaky,"Like many reviewers, I've found this product to be terrible. It leaks along the seams. We've gotten two leaks with pretty gentle use. I was hoping that it would be similar to the water carrier that my parents have had for years, but this is a poorly made piece of crap."
2,Good for one trip only,"I bought 2 of these containers for Burning Man. It's nice that they are collapsible, but when they are filled with water they become like big balloons and a bit hard to work with. They lasted for the week I was out in the desert, but upon coming home I found they both had sprung leaks. Also the plastic in areas has stretched and become very thin. They are going to the recycle bin. I wish I had saved the money and simply bought 2.5 gallon water jugs at the store. They're much easier to handle and don't leak."
1,Do not buy!,"I recently ordered five of these containers and could not have been more disappointed. Two of the five had holes in them and leaked out of the box. Although the container looks like it is made of a rubber-like material, it is a lightweight plastic. Thus, the containers are prone to separating along the seams and leaking. I also found it difficult to collapse them after they had been used once. In the end we threw away 4 of the five after the first use.Unless you're looking for a single use container, I'd spend a little more money and get something better in quality."
1,Not worth ANY price!,"Even with very careful handling and storage in sheltered, typical room temperature condition, this item developed a leak after just two refillings. Clearly, the quality of the plastic material is substandard. Avoid this product."
2,Misrepresented,"This is not as depicted. It looks like it would come out of a usb port and angle to the LEFT (tab on top) but it does not. It angled to the right (should have tab on bottom). In my case I got it to create space on the right side of my laptop so I could use my mouse close to the right side. That requires a right angle adapter which would go to the rear (right looking at socket) as in the picture, but this goes to the front/left, making it both misrepresented and useless. It is cheap enough to not be worth returning. If this is what you want it for, then it will not work."
5,perfect compliment to the D30,"I hesitated to buy the battery grip because I thought I didn't really need it and that it would make the camera too bulky. But it is a great accessory that is ALWAYS on my camera now.I don't worry about battery power much anymore since there are always two inside.And best of all, I can snap photos in the vertical orientation so much easier. It's seamless. In addition to having an additional shutter-button on the battery grip, there is a focus-point selector button.Certainly worth having."
2,It worked well until it stopped.,"I bought the battery grip in October, it worked fine until November. Now I have no idea how who to call for help."
2,Boring,"I did not like this book at all. I bought it because of all the good reviews, but now I wish I hadn't. It was very boring and annoyed me more than anything. I dont think I will try Liz Carlyle books again."
2,Superlative Content Awful Remastering,"This ""Ultimate Collection"" is essentially only about the songs and not about the sound. The remastering is absolutely appalling. While there is an adequate job with bass and midrange presentation, the top end is so bright that at moderate listening levels it is almost unbearable. None of the old Motown LPs sounded this bad and they were nowhere near audiophile quality. If you have an inexpensive audio set up, you can probably withstand the high end onslaught. But if your system is capable of accurate sound presentation, skip this one."
1,Great Music but poor sound,"Definitely contains their great hits, however the remastering is very poor. Listen to it with or without earphones and you can hear bad distortion. My vinyl recordings of these songs sound 1000% better."
1,Really bad transfer,Most of the tracks are severely clipped. You can do a better job than this with the vinyl and a PC. Very disappointing.
3,"just like the 45""s","In 1964 I was in love with Mary [ this from a white boy growing up in St.Louis] This colletion to me is great.The songs sound just like the singles I used to play at home.Even though I like the 3 greatest hits volums better,this CD is a must for anyone that loves great music. G O F O R I T !"
1,it was pov,"the play Shirley Valentine was boring, and pov, who wants to read about some old crump who talks to the wall? not me......"
5,Fascinating look at country legends.,"The shelf of good books on country music is a small one. However, this is one of the best. It contains thoughtful, often amusing interviews with a number of country and western entertainers, some famous, a few not so famous.Most of the interviews are excellent and highly informative. There are only a few ""clinkers"" for example, she takes David Allan Coes intermittently amusing messianic rant a little too seriously. However, that is the exception. Most of the conversations, especially with women , offer real insights. For example, the interview with Lacy J. Dalton tells the reader much about the life, and the beliefs, of that sadly neglected talent, while the interview with Loretta Lynn possesses an odd poignancy."
2,SO DISAPPOINTED!,"There's very little of anything having to do with Ruby on video and I was hoping this would help feel the void, but I was sadly disappointed. I found it very hard to sit through the movie. Now I remember why I never went to see it in the Theatre."
2,"Copy, not original",Received a copy of the movie which I was not informed of prior to purchasing. Was expecting an original.A 14yr old Melissa unbelieveable as a 6 yr old but a great movie nonetheless.Almost identical dialogue as the 1962 version and Patty as Annie steals the show. She makes an excellent Helen AND Annie.
1,"Do not buy these for use on Delta 14"" saws","Carter has a well deserved reputation for high quality and precision. That's why these tires are such a disappointment. The wheels on most (if not all) Delta 14"" band saws have tire grooves that are 1"" wide and 1/8"" deep. Delta OEM tires completely fill the groove. The Carter tires are 7/8"" by 3/32"" and, according to their customer service manager, this size was chosen because it also fits the Jet 14"" saws. That may be, but it is a decidedly bad compromise for owners of Delta saws. Buy the Delta Orange tires if you need a replacement set."
3,Pretty Good,"I remember when the first song Tell Me (I'll Be Around) came out. It was overshadowed by LL Cool J's ""Who Do You Love?"" featuring Total. Both sampled Bernard Wright's 1980s song ""Who Do You Love?"" and both songs were out around the same time. LL stole a little of their shine. I liked this group back then but it's a shame they didn't last."
5,This movie is really good.,"This movie, not putting down Denzel and Whitney, is much better than the remake. I mean, is any remake better than the original? I haven't found any yet. The closest that I have seen is Sabrina, originally starring Humphrey Bogart and Audrey Hepburn. It was remade starring Harrison Ford and Julia Ormand. It came close, but still did not reach the mark of better than its predecessor. The original is always better. Such is the case with this one. It is MUCH, MUCH better than The Preacher's Wife. I give it 5 stars."
5,"Get it, Get it, Get it.","Get it, Get it, Get it.Now that we've gone past the subtleties, this is indeed one of the better feel good oldies and definitely one of the best Cary Grant shows.Amazingly, even though made in 1948, it is still soooo.. relevant today. The issues raised and the sentiments felt are still so real and alive even today.The best part is that for an old show it is amazingly accepting and non-preachy about a lot of things. There is also sufficient twists and turns in the plot to rise above the genre of innocent and simplistic films from the past.Love it. It is still excellent and will definitely more than hold its own with the best shows of today."
4,A Feel-Good Movie,"My mother had this DVD in her collection the last time I visited. I watched it and knew I had to own it, as well.It is a clean, interesting story with plenty of conflict to heighten the viewer's investment in the characters and story.Loved that it was set around Christmas.Will the minister stop obsessing over his congregation's new sanctuary and spend time with his wife and young daughter?Will their lives as ""big time"" minister and wife in a ""big house"" ever be as satisfying as their previous life in a small, community in a less rich part of town?Cary Grant is an angel who helps them figure out what is important in this life."
3,Wonderful Moments of Whimsy,"The Bishop's Wife is a fantasy about an angel come to earth to help a husband (the bishop of the title) and his wife (also from the title) find that place where they used to be. The casting of Cary Grant as the angel is perfect and the movie shines the most when he is on screen doing his magic, particulary the scenes with Loretta Young on the cab ride leading to ice skating. David Niven is perfectly distant and Monty Woolley does a wonderful bit of magic of his own with his part. Despite all of these good bits, the movie still does not quite work for me. The ending always seems a little fuzzy and one is left with the feeling that nothing has possibly been changed by this miraculous event and Loretta Young will still act more from a sense of duty than a pursuit of joy. It is worth seeing for Cary Grant but the magic seems to grow a little dimmer with every viewing."
3,nostalgia,"TV wrestling was quite different back then. sometimes they actually worked up a sweat. the guys are bigger now days, but they don't know many holds. I wonder how the Undertaker would do against BoBo Brazil? I bet the Sheik could out villain anyone"
1,Waste of money!!!!,"Waste of my money. I have purchased some horrible remanufactured ink products but this particular one tops the list. The ink came leaking through the packaging and stained my carpet. It leaked so much that I could not even send it back. TOTAL WASTE of money, I recommend other purchasing options!!!!"
2,Exellent Service,"OC Products has been extremely helpful to me in my problems with these cartridges. Apparently my old printer was just not set up right, and unable to use the cartridges that I ordered. OC responded to my call when I wasn't able to print properly after inserting them; and has even refunded my payment. I gave this product only 2 stars because I could not use them.But thank you, OC for your prompt and helpful response."
3,A healthy and fulfilling snack,"I bought this because it was supposed to help regulate blood sugar by evening out metabolizing of the calories. It did satisfy my hunger long term, but the product had a bit of an aftertaste."
2,Not my cup of tea,"I tried to like this book but it was so far out..........just didn't hold my attention. I kept pushing myself to read it but never did finish so I can't comment except for the first half. Many disjointed characters which became hard to distinguish one from another at times. In all fairness, fantasy is not my favorite genre so if you like fantasy, you may like The Arrivals."
2,Wanted to like it,"I had tried everything before for my razor bumps and ingrown hair. For the first week, it seemed to work, then it just stopped working. Bumps came back, ingrown hair was there. I'm still using it, hoping that it will work again (plus it's not cheap)and so far, nothing. Maybe I have stubborn skin/hair. Well, at least I now know!"
5,GREAT PRODUCT!!,"I have had continued problems with ingrown hairs and bumps under my chin and neck. Being an african-american male I used many products that are supposed to get rid of razor bumps. I tried this product and was amazed in just two weeks the bumps started to go away, and not only that; my skin became smoother and clearer. I am very impressed!!"
3,Works to some extent but not a miracle yet,"I have battled ingrowns and razor bumps for 25+ years on my neck. I have used blades and electrics, tried antibiotics, creams, you name it. So far nothing has really worked with any noticeable benefits. I tried this figuring maybe something new has come out. Well I am about 2 1/2 weeks into it now and there is SOME improvement. So far it has helped, but maybe only 50% or so reduction. The hair still grows over on a curve, so maybe I need more time. It doesn't burn and has a pleasant frag. It seems to keep my neck well hydrated. But generally, at least not yet, my neck still has numerous red bumps and some ingrowns. I hope it helps further after longer use, but for now it is better, but not fantastic."
2,OK gloves.,"My husbandbought these gloves for hunting to keep his hands dry and warm.He would leave the house at 6:00 am and not get home until 6:00 pm. The gloves kept his hands dry, but not warm. He says they are ok to shovel snow for about an hour or to wear in the car. But not all day in the snow. He would tell everyone to look for a different pair of gloves. These are wrothless."
2,Another Country is where we're all headed!,"This is a field guide to the foreign land of our parents - a help & resource as our elders age & we must talk with them about medicine, hygiene, dependence, selling the car, loneliness & love. This book jumped into my hand because it's all about what we're doing right now - taking care of our Poppa in his final years. While Poppa's son speaks his father's language & can mostly get his frames of references, there are over 40 unknown years before his son was a twinkle in his Poppa's eye. Meanwhile I have only a smattering of references with this plodding mischievous fellow who avoids saying yea or nay. He also has an endless well of stories about anything & these should be told to a bevy of youngsters at his knees. I also know now that we're not at fault for his oldness nor is it our job to make him happy. Only he can do that. It is our job, however, to keep ourselves happy! This book has some eminently useful information, strategies & ideas. Well done!"
3,An excellent concept not fully realized,The book was an ok read but ultimately was unsatisfying. THe love interest was a little pat. And he totally went overboard with the ending. I bought it based on the idea which I thought was fresh and topical. Ultimately I thought he could have been more clever with it.
2,Cute but cheap,"I guess you get what you pay for but I thought it would be a bit nicer than it was, very cheap looking. Not well made"
4,lovely and bittersweet,"The author did a fabulous job reminding the reader of a time of seductive innocence. The protangonists were sincere, patient and genuine. I would reccomend this book to any person who is seeking a world of tolerance and understanding. There is no sex or disrobing. The kids made me want to go back in time. I found this a touching, emotional novel. Read it!"
1,amazon rip off number 3,my bad - silly me buy ink set for printer on one click ( without checking shipping price ) and golly gee - 14.99 for less than half a pound on a 32.99 order ( standard shipping ). get ink set and find out that each pkg not marked for ink color. how is the ink? some day I will figure all this out and let you know.
3,Could of been better,"I loved the fact that finally Hank's death had been touched apon. And that we did get answers about the abductions. It's just that we already knew ""The Royal Four"" were created from other people. So not many questions were answered. If you're a Roswell fan I would say read it anyway. You do get a few answers."
4,Nice fit for any pocket,"I was very pleased with the quality of this knife. The only negative that I have after carrying it for some time, is that the ""pin"" that passes through the blade just behind the cutout, can be snagged when reaching into your pocket and opening the blade slightly. I have not had a chance yet to see if it can be tightened slightly so that doesn't occur and am now careful when pulling out change etc.."
4,Must see if you read the book,"If you have read the book ""Endurance"" you must see this dvd. It is a documentary but helps you put faces and actual photographs of the expedition with the names from the book. My husband and I loved this story, it is an amazing adventure."
3,The Endurance - Shackleton's Legendary Antartic Expedition,The story is a dry and slow moving but historically very informative. The original photography of the expedition is great and the recreated scenes almost seem original. It's a sad tale but a very good one for fans of adventure or early explorers.
4,Good book with a common story line.,"The Expendables are your normal bunch of American Corn-Bread boys. They are thown together and expected to fight as a team in the jungles of Vietnam, which they do. I found the guys to be waaaay too common, and that they fought a little too good. Other than that, the story is intriguing and action-packed. At times, the battle is broken up with humor. It is interesting to see a group of very different types of men to interact with each other, especially in the beginning of the story. Great story!"
3,Inconsistent and distracting.,"If you are approaching this as a sequel to ""Anywhere but Here,"" you will be sorely disappointed with ""The Lost Father."" Important details, the things that stick with the protagonist (her Wisconsin hometown, her stepfather's last name, and her father's name, to name a few), are changed, and it seems this can only be the result of carelessness on the behalf of Simpson and *especially* her editor. If you are wondering what happened to the bratty and real Ann August, you will be disoriented once placed into the world of the overachieving Mayan Stevenson, a woman whose childhood amazingly parallels that of Ann's but doesn't quite match.However, if you truly enjoyed the academic side of Simpson's writing, the structure and voice and insight and whatnot, you will find she still deserves the three stars I've given this book."
4,Good Follow-On Murder Mystery,"Before there was Sherlock Holmes, there was Detective Robert Colbeck of Scotland Yard, proto-railfan and serious investigator. In 1852, he embarks on his second adventure, once again aided by his loyal sergeant and harassed by his martinent boss.You needn't have read the first book (THE RAILWAY DETECTIVE) to enjoy this mystery. A cobbler is brutally murdered on an excursion train to a prizefight. It turns out that the 'cobbler' is also a hangman, and not a very good one. Who killed him and why? Will other murders follow? It's a good yarn and the time and place of early-mid victorian London and England are brought to life with nice, crisp descriptive prose.This isn't a profound or profoundly complex book, but it is fun, diverting, and has some good historical fiction worked in. Mystery buffs and train spotters alike will enjoy it!"
5,Cute Picture Frame!!,"This is the cutest picture frame!! It fits just about anywhere. It holds the i-zone photos perfectly!! I love its color and shape! It is very soft, too!! If you don't have one, get it!!"
1,"Good idea, not such a good book","As a woman who has just been diagnosed with breast cancer, I have spent the last 3 weeks researching and reading books on the topic. I had high hopes for this book. I was disappointed to find that it is poorly written and despite all those pages, doesn't say anything helpful. I don't recommend this one even though I haven't found another one to recommend."
1,Don't ever think of Buying this Garbage!,"I personally believe Amazon should stop selling this. I believe this is the worst product that I have ever bought. Ear phones were broken right out of the box. The Radio never stays in one station, it just keeps jumping from one to the next. It doesn't matter how good the signal is, it will still jump. The clip on the back broke of in about 10 minutes of use. On top of all that, you have to sometimes press on the back where the batteries are because it turns off by itself.I know it is cheap, but don't throw away 5 or 6 bucks on this garbage. I am really upset that Amazon sells this garbage!"
3,Nice Eye Candy,"""Gorgeous Knitted Afghans"" is a wonderful book, with a lot of eye candy, but what I find missing is a picture of the back side of an afghan or blanket. There are not even hints if a throw is reversible - I don't mind looking differently on the back side - or if the backside looks bad enough to be hidden behind some lining.To a beginner like me, starting a task like knitting an afghan is challenging enough, and with no help as to the usability of said throw I rather look at the pictures, sigh a little, and use some same old, same old (but proven reversible) knitting stitch..."
2,The Author's Anger Showed On Every Page,"Mr. Beaumont has put out a great book for lovers of conspriacy theories. I don't think that cops, teachers, and politicians are involved in some vast conspiracy to brainwash everyone in America. There are too many individuals in these professions to account for any kind of monolithic movement.The author mostly rants for 150+ pages, and sometimes it becomes almost humorous. That's why I rated it a ""4"" and not a ""0""."
5,I wish that they had 10 stars,Wow! that's all that I can say! Teresa is a very talented author and has a great way with words. She can make arguements seem so real that I cried.
5,Great Book!!!,"I really loved this book.When I started reading it, I couldn't stop. I was hooked. I love the characters, Arian and Tristan. I truely enjoy reading this book. To me, it was a page turner. Great Job Ms. Medeiros!"
3,Misnomer,"This book is a great overview of basic management skills and principles of leadership, and is well written as such. The title should maybe be changed to reflect the content (i.e. Management Principles for Recruiting, Training and Maintaining Firefighters).It does briefly give some ideas for recruitment of firefighters, and does state that you must train those firefighters in order to maintain interest; however, that is what we were primarily interested in when we ordered so we were somewhat disappointed. We have a small volunteer service ordered with the intention of getting some new recruitment ideas, and possibly some new training ideas to help keep things interesting.If we had ordered this book to learn management and leadership principles we would have given it a 5 out of 5, but as we were looking for something a little more hands on, our rating is 3 of 5."
2,Non-existing tech support!,"This is not a product for the technically faint-of-heart. I've had problems installing the software onto my new MacBook Pro. The installation stops halfway without explanation, forcing me to uninstall, reboot, re-install 3 times without any success. I've sent email to Parallels' support site because there is no free phone support - you must pay $29.95 for the 'privilege' of talking to their techs about problems with their product. Two weeks later my question is still unanswered. Their technical support site is not very helpful or informative either. Your best bet is the Parallels forum. This company seems like a mom & pop operation. I'm returning Parallels and getting myself a copy of Fusion."
3,Not the latest version,"This score I rate here has nothing to do with Parallels Desktop for Mac which I love and would have given five stars, but rather with [...]. The version [...] selling here is not the latest version which is 3.0 while this product is 2.5. Even though you will get automatic free upgrade to 3.0 from Parallels as soon as you register your product with Parallels, it is still inconvenient and a bit deceiving to see [...] but still does not clearly indicate it is older version, which is a bit deceiving to me because most of other computer software they sell they mentioned which version the software is."
3,Parallels Desktop for Mac,The software was very confusing to use and the customer service was not very helpful. They didn't respond to my questions.
3,Probably Worthwhile in the Long Run,"I recently installed XP on my Intel Mac using both Bootcamp and Parallels. Bootcamp was a very straightforward procedure and I've had very little trouble with it. Parallels on the other hand is a much more finicky program that seems to look for new reasons not to work (and more often than not, finds them).I suppose that I will eventually get it running properly. But it is a shame that a program with so much potential is such a pain to get going."
2,install is easy but...,"..it might be my fault but i can't get it to work. I hear it's great, I'm fairly savvy, but I can't use it. So far anyway. Every time I try to install an OS it just bombs."
1,Parallels problems,"When installing Parallels 3.0 on my iMac it hung at a window asking to reauthorize my Windows XP. I could not close Parallels without going to Windows to shut down. I had to use Boot Camp to go to Windows, but Windows crashed while booting up. So next an Apple Store tech spent 3 hours trying various strategies to get Parallels up and working & in this process had to delete the Windows partition & never was able to get Parallels to function. His supervisor finally decided that there was a corrupt file in Parallels. Now I will try Focus and try to reconstruct my Windows partition & files. No fun at all."
5,"Have your Mac and WIndows, too!","Ready for the switch to Mac (with the Intel processor) but can't give up your favorite solitaire game or odd application? GET THIS PRODUCT! Now that there is Office for Mac, there are fewer and fewer Win-only items, but for those few, Parallels Desktop is the asnwer. It is easy to install, easy to use and you won't believe how fast Windows loads up on your mini ""computer-within-a-computer."" NOTE: When you are ready to trash your PC- SAVE the Windows disc (XP is best) because you will need it to use this progrsm. Now I have all the great features of MAC (and its superior stability) AND the few little things I could not leave behind (SolSuite)."
1,"install, crash, repeat","Terrible. Install, crash, reinstall, crash, etc. etc. Nothing but trouble.Difficult to uninstall, too."
2,Not useful for Video editing,"The software installed easily and runs the Windows XP operating system without problems. However, you do not have the ability to import or export any thing via USB, Firewire, or most other external connections. I had hoped to be able to use the platform to edit video on software that only works in Windows. Bootcamp (the download from Apple) worked much better for that application. Parallels is a great tool if you just want to access basic Windows components but do not need to export or import large amounts of data."
4,No problems here... I like Parallels!,"For what it's worth, I just bought Parallels from Amazon for just $59 and am completely satisfied. I came quickly and was indeed version 3.0 as advertised. I have had no speed problems... I think it runs Windows XP very smoothly. I haven't tried Windows Vista nor do I play an graphics intensive Windows games... so I can't comment on that. Overall... I like it."
3,"Good game, troublesome playset","The main problem we've had with this game is that the playset easily slips off the keyboard. I ended up having to figure out the keys to push to control the game. So, now to play the game, my son uses the keyboard instead of the playset."
4,A return to greatness,I have all of his albums and this marks a return to some of his best work. The love songs are amazing and the pop songs are great to listen to while driving. There is probably not a bad track here however it is lacking that special something that would make this album worth five stars. I can not wait for the next one.
5,Excellent book,My two favorite romances this year (so far) were this book and the first in Mary Balogh's new series. I really liked this novel - set during the Regency period because the interaction between the two main characters was wonderfully funny and also very passionate. The duel and waltz scenes were great - really made you feel like you were right there in the period.
2,Excellent CD for Marvelettes fans OR new listeners,"This CD takes you through ten years of great Marvelettes recordings starting with Please Mr. Postman and continuing thru the years til their break-up. You'll hear all the classics, including Too Many Fish In The Sea, I'll Keep Holding On, and You're My Remedy. The Marvelettes were truly the ""girl group"" of the century. At their peak, they were the only girl group to feature two lead singers. Listen, and you'll agree, the Marvelettes were a soulful group to be reckoned with. It's too bad Motown didn't think so."
5,Noisiest thing out of Detroit since my mother's old Ford.,Absolutley a winner from start to finish. The only item even better was the 2 CD set with b-sides released several years ago. This is the perfect summer trip driving music.
5,Pure Southern Rock with No Apologies!,"When I saw Blackberry Smoke open for ZZ Top, I knew I had found something special. I went home and purchased all of their CDs. They're all really great, but ""Bad Luck Ain't No Crime"" is the cream of the crop. It's loud, in-your-face southern rock exploding with energy and strength. These guys are the real deal. They don't look or sound pretty, but they're just what you want to be listening to. This album is extraordinary from start to finish, and never lets up. You just can't sit still. Highlights include ""Testify,"" ""Sanctified,"" and especially ""Muscadine."" Do yourself a favor: Buy this CD and turn it up LOUD!!!"
5,A Must Book for Those Who Want to Improve Relationships,"I have found only a few writers who can explain complex issues in terms that everybody can understand. Chris Carey is one of those gifted authors. Without fail, I am able to teach my nationwide seminars more effectively because of his masterful translation of terms, buttressed by humorous, memorable illustrations. In fact, I quote Chris Carey frequently. Getting to Know You is a book that will help readers understand that our goal is not to ""change"" people who seem different. Instead, we want to identify the traits that shape their profiles, and use that information to relate to these individuals more effectively. Equally significant, we will understand our own personal styles more clearly by reading this book."
4,Perfect gift for the snow enthusiast!,"This was the only present my father stressed this past Christmas, and was so excited when he opened it up! Although it seems a little flimsy (it topples over when one boot is put on it), it does the job. Auto shut off is a great feature. After our recent ""blizzard"" my father came home and immediately put his boots on this, and they were dry in no time! Well worth the money! The only thing I wish was that the base of it was a little heavier, to avoid it falling over, but it's fine when you put boots on both sides."
4,fast and quick,Warm air works very well.. dries all my gear after a long day quickly and efficiently.
5,Should have bought earlier!!,I have been using this to dry my kids gloves this winter. It works AWESOME!!! I tried to put them in the dryer and the fingers of the gloves never seemed to get dry. Within an hour they are dry with this product. Would definitely recommend!!
1,I never received the product,I was billed and never received the product. I cannot contact amazon to check out why the item was never shipped.
3,"Great singer, OK album","I just started listening to the album recently. I must break rank with most of the reviews here and say that I absolutely love, ""Long As I Live,"" and ""Tight Jeans."" True, the subject matter of ""Tight Jeans"" is kind of corny, but the arrangement is very smooth. ""Long As I Live"" makes me want to fall in love with that special somebody (although he coulda kept that ghetto ad lib that referenced his kids names out... then again, the album IS titled ""Still Ghetto"" LOL). ""Backtight"" is also a nice one. I don't really like the other songs (including the more popular ones that he released)."
3,It's decent,"Jaheim has some good songs on this disc, although they tend to blur together. After a while, you get tired of hearing the same, formulaic songs. Before the end of the disc, you are left feeling like you have listened to the same song over and over and over and........"
2,"Strange, sometimes silly, and somewhat stupid","One of the least appealing stories that CM3 has written. I couldn't figure out what the meaning of it was, other then a rampant romp through a weird reality where cloned creatures are kept as pets. Strange, sometimes silly, and somewhat stupid - this story is all about just being a story for story sake (unlike CM3s other novels). Not one of his better works.It wasn't what I had expected it to be. Written in under the guise of a ""fairy tale"", I found that for the most part, the nonsensical interactions the characters had with each other seemed a little too absurd for my liking.I came across this little story after reading his other works, and was pleasantly dissappointed. Maybe I just need to read it again, but unlike his other works, I didn't feel any connection to the story, nor understood if there were any subtexts or themes within.Who knows, maybe it's just my brain running out of my ear and pretending to be just a jelly sandwich."
4,Disturbing,This has to be a category of its own. It's a dark graphic adult fairy tale that leaves you with a disturbing vibe when finished. It is very desolate.
4,great resource,"This is an excellent resource for gardening and I look forward to using it. My only complaint is that there must be an updated version of this, because I saw the book in a store and it had more detailed pictures and descriptions that were absent from my version. If I had known I would have purchased the newer version."
5,Wow,"This book is terrific if you wish to grow any vegetable. This book covers absolutely EVERY topic for gardening except for using chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Although I personally do not have a problem using non organic methods this book has showed me how to use other methods that are cheaper, readily available, and more productive. After reading this book I have taken a much more organic stand towards gardening for the reasons I mentioned above but I still resort to chemicals for pest control. I feel that if my only vice is chemical pesticides on home grown vegetables I still fair better than 95% of Americans. This book is like having the old timer who sold produce at the farmers market when you were a child on your shelf."
5,"Excellent ,plenty of information","Living in VT, I wanted local information, about gardening and this book had it all, you can not go wrong buying the book."
5,A+: it really is THE bible for vegetable gardeners,"I absolutely love this book. The gardening system is sound and organic, and it is presented in clear, simple language in a lovely, easy-to-grasp design. So often gardening books are long on written advice but short on visuals. Or they are ONLY visuals, with the text nothing more than captions. This book has it all."
1,"Pretty, but not nearly all Inclusive","This is a beautiful book. It falls short on helping the beginning gardener. If you were to follow the advice of the writers of this book, you would pay THOUSANDS on equipment and in your time. I DO NOT recommend this book, especially if you are a beginner."
1,The Vegetable Gardener's Bible,"I was very disappointed in this book, its like he took all the info from 20 other books and compiled it, as all he talks about is what every other book has already stated."
2,Darnell Robinson?,Does anyone remember Darnell Robinson from season 3.He had rihanna as his date.Does he appear in the dvd anywhere? I am curious as to what is on the dvd.
2,This sucks,You get most of the same episodes on seasons one and two (sneak peeks of season three) Save your money.
2,Not as fun as I hoped it would be...,"This ""mom-lit"" book provides an entertaining enough read (though certainly not an escape!), though a pretty predictable one. I expected it to be filled with more child-oriented anecdotes, or at least entertaining ""cutesy"" moments. Unfortunately, this was more of one mother's overly introspective gaze about her conflicted role as a stay-at-home-mom. Her dissatisfaction with her life became a little trying at times, and while I finished the book, it is definitely one I would never pick up again to re-read. It wasn't terrible, just not the light, fun book that I was expecting."
4,An Honest Protrayal,I bought this book when I was home on maternity leave contemplating becoming a stay at home mom. I was devouring whatever I could find fiction and non-fiction on the ins and outs of being a SAHM. I didn't end up reading the book until I returned back to work and although I am a career mom I loved it and appreciated it's wit and candor just the same.
1,very short playlist,"It's really a shame that a record label as RCA edit a dvd with only 6 tracks. I don't care if I have to pay a litte more, but I like to watch a great dvd. Besides I bought this because its title ""American Farewell Tour"". I believed this is was a concert, but only video clips."
3,CAUTION: This is NOT a concert DVD,"This DVD is ok (thus 3 stars). Seller was fine. Condition of DVD was fine. However, the title (Alabama: American Farewell Tour DVD) is very misleading. This is purely a collection of previously released individual music videos. All of the videos included are the videos that ran on CMT or GAC or whatever; not any live concert footage. We love Alabama; but were hoping for a live concert DVD (and didn't get it...)."
4,useful in school for literacy,"This stamp set is well designed in that the letters are visible as a child uses them to stamp, so that it doesn't turn upside down, for instance. However, some of the letters that have lines in the middle as in H or M or W or A do not hold ink well in the middle area of these letters. This annoys the children who want a perfect letter."
3,"Good book, but.......","Use this book as a guide, but do remember that people are all different and what is ok for one grieving parent may not be acceptable to another. Juliane Grant says it's comforting to a grieving parent to hear their child's name. I have a friend who lost his daughter in a very tragic accident and to him, hearing her name is the equivalent of ripping a scab off a wound. It just hurts him too much."
1,Awful,"I ordered 3 bags of these. They came today. Alot of them don't even have any chocolate in them. They are nothing like the old fashioned ones. They are very fruit flavored, hard and lack chocolate. Not a good buy."
1,very disappointed,I have been going crazy looking for the traditional candies from my youth and was excited to find this. There is a very thin fine line of chocolate with no taste of it. I had to actually look at the candy to see if there was chocolate in it. Very disappointed. Definitely not the chocolate filled straws I remember.
5,My music collection did'nt seem complete without it.,"I have always loved Smokey! Partially because I grew from childhood to adulthood with his music. It's funny, though, sometimes as we grow we take for granted all the greatness around us--the music, the people and places. Somehow we just think they'll aways be there, till they're not. And one day you hear Smokey sing one of his jams! All of a sudden it all comes back--the people, the places--good or bad, it doesn't matter. And you realize Smokey was there living it all with you.My personal favorite is ""The Love I Saw In You Was Just a Mirage"". Maybe because I once identified with it. Or maybe just because he sounds so sweet. Another personal favorite is ""Swept For You Baby"" found on another CD. Classic Smokey! Anyway, as one of the last of the ""Baby Boomers"" my music collection didn't seem complete without it."
2,smokey's bests is not a fair collection from fan's point of view,"was very disappointed in the selections, even though i reviewed them beforew i bought it. just wanted heis best hits to reminess. did not happen ge"
2,Good graphics but???,"Got this game as part of my console purchase (along with R:FOM).Have been playing it exclusively for last few weeks after finishing COD1 and 2 on PC. Only playing single player version.Pro: Excellent graphics and sound.Con: Excessive use of Sixaxis gets tiresome and repetitive. Example: twisting the joysticks to control mortors/heavy weapons where simple movements would be more effective particularly when FPS targeting is somewhat troublesome with this controller. In the level using a heavy weapon to destroy tanks/armored cars, the cursor went where it felt like and could not lead the targets for a decent kill chance. AI has continues parades of enemy, floating enemy, and own squad members moving into firing line and grenade toss area. The story line is inconsistent where one level you are American, next Polish, next French Reisistance. Very poor compared to original versions.I recommend not buying and will unload this when I finish single player."
1,This won't be HD Demo,"What a difference between a documentary and a post card ? A little bit of soul.Very far away from ""Planet Earth""As HD DVD, I'm surprised of the low quality of the shooting or the transfert : it look like a poor standard DVD.Over saturated colors, over exposed (whites) instable images, jolts, judder, dirt on the camera lens. I have the impression of beeing fooled..."
3,disappointed,"Yes, they ARE magnetic, however, very thin and flimsy. Won't hold anything other than a very thin, small sheet of paper. They were able to take the printed information and they really looked nice, but not what I expected. Also, they came in a single sheet and had to be cut by hand, so edges were not as neat (we used an exacto knife to cut and separate them)."
1,flimsy,"The magnets went through the printer with ease, I just wasn't happy with the result, they hold 1 sheet of paper and that's about it. Great I'm sure for a child's art project, but not what I was looking for."
2,Awful!,I am so disappointed in this product. It made my project just look sloppy and I ended up not using it at all. The remaining sheets are still untouched in the packet. And for the price? A disappointment.
2,Thin,"these are much thinner than what i am used to. they did not work for the project that i intended them for. yes, they will stick to a metal surface but it does not take much for them to fall off. they barely support their own weight."
5,"some great western shows from yesteryear,bcieclipise does it again","if you have read any of my reviews you know i love westerns,and you should know that i really like this great collection of some of t.v. early westerns.bcieclipise is a company that i have come to like very much. they started this trend of putting movies and shows into a 5 or 10 disc set. most of their sets are very good and have nice if not great transfers.this set of old t.v. westerns is a fine cross section of some old westerns, some i had never heard of, but all of them are pretty good. i don't have a break down of all the shows for you but if you like westerns like me i think this is one collection you may want to have.they are all kid friendly and my boys watch these old shows with me and we have a ball. that alone puts this set high on my list of dvd's to have."
1,Life After Death? Or Def! Or Just Dead...,"I'm a serious Montell Jordan Fan, so this is not about hating on him! however this review is for those who r Montell fans.. Montell has seven (7) albums and this by far is his worst album.. 3 songs top and thats giving him three on this album slightly. just save your money they did not have samples to listen to, which should have been my warning not to buy because normally when there r no samples the album, is usually not that great. save your money i'll countinue to support Mr, Montell if he keeps on creating the music he is known for . and that's great r&b.. this album is whack!!!!"
5,Totally awesome show!!!!,"Show is great!!! Story is incredible, acting is supurp. Nothing like this on our line up of crappy tv. Seem to watch more and more of the British channel. Highly recommend watching this."
4,Works fine,This product is a replacement battery for my plantronics work phone. It works fine so far. Thank you very much.
1,save your money what was gotti thinking?,"first of all 2pac accused nas of biting him back before his death and nas only proved pac right and betcha he's mad right now and the pac biting continues as toni braxton remakes me and my girlfriend with irv rapping please. then to make matters worse there's unfoolish the remix and yes biggie's ghost makes a cameo this was already on her debut along with the happy remix which sounds like the original except charli baltimore raps on here and there's the baby, baby, baby, remix which sounds the same except they add scarface to the mix and like I said gotti just put this out cause he knows the crowd's gonna go out and buy weak stuff like this deserves no stars really."
5,Imagine Anita Baker trapped inside a man's body.,"Johnny Gill draws strong comparisons to Anita Baker, and for good reason, too. Like Baker, he sings songs about love in a very sentimental way. ""My, My, My"" is the answer to Baker's ""Body and Soul."" ""Lady Dujour"" is like ""Angel,"" ""Wrap My Body Tight"" compares to ""Sweet Love,"" ""There U Go"" spells ""Been Too Long,"" and ""Quiet Time to Play"" gives way to ""Soul Inspiration."" In conclusion, Johnny Gill and Anita Baker are so much alike in more ways than one. And they're both great crooners, too! ""Favorites"" is the album to get! From Johnny, that is."
1,SUCKERED AGAIN!!!!,"This is the LAST ""LIVE"" ALBUM I WILL EVER BUY!!!!!! Where's the live part? I already own all the studio versions of these songs!!!! Shame on Alabama for duping their fans in this manner!! STAY RETIRED ALREADY! No doubt their marketing department felt they could dupe fans into thinking they were buying a live album by putting in such a duplicitous name like ""American Farewell Tour"". Well they suckered me. For the LAST time, I assure you."
1,Alabama Is Misleading Their Fans .......,"I purchased this CD because I assumed it was a "" live, concert CDrepresenting their final, "" Farewell Tour."" It is NOT !!!! It is another greatest hits CD. Is Alabama that hard up for money to cheat and mislead their fans. They have released numerous Best of, Greatest Hits CD's. Why another one ????? I would never have purchased this if I had known what it really represented. I wish I could return it to Amazon for a refund. I have lost a lot of respect for the boys from Ft. Payne and I have been a fan from the beginning............Mike BowsmanMelbourne, Florida"
4,"Too droll, but still delightful","A fun listen for anyone interested in unconventional sampling. The album is a cornucopia of acoustic-derived samples and cascading textures, marred (but only slightly) by an overabundance of tongue-in-cheek spoken snippets. A less self-conscious approach might not have resulted in such a joyous, surreal romp through popular culture and quasi-mysticism, though.Any neo-folk revivalist type should own this -- as a reference, at least -- of what else they can play when they burn out on covering ""Uncle Penn."""
2,"enamel chipped after 4 uses, even with handwashing!","I have already contacted the Lodge Mfg. company re: this product & the quality of it. I rec'd it as a gift, and the enamel began to chip off after 4 uses. I am currently in the process of returning it to Lodge Mfg., and will wait for their response to this issue. But so far, I am not favorably impressed by the quality."
5,great gadget,"The Perfection Strips are a great tool. I use them when making sugar cookies with my grandchildren. I make the cookie dough ahead of time and chill it. Then I am able to set up the work area with a silicone mat, powdered sugar, rolling pin, and the perfection strips as guides. My four year old grandson wants to do everything himself and using the Perfection Strips to regulate the thickness of the cookies allows him to roll to his heart's delight and the cookies are uniform in thickness. He can use the cookie cutters and decorate the cookies with jimmies and sprinkles. My ten year old granddaughter loves to bake and the Perfection Strips give her more independence as she is able to do more of the work independently. I, too, like the Perfection Strips as it helps make baked items more uniform ensuring more even baking."
1,"Great reader, Bad writer","Some of you are probally confused about this product since some are giving 5 stars and others 1 star. Well i will tell you right now why. Because the burner will destroy DVD's if they have certain file types. The one's giving 5 stars didn't use those file types, or just blame their software. Its not like im using bad software, i've used nero 6 and 7. Those work perfectly with other drives. Don't blame the software, as many reviewers have. The problem lies in the drivers.It can read the most scratched up disks, it can write cd's perfectly, but it can't write a load of movie files! The only way to get around this is convert the movie file to another format, and if you have to buy software to do that, its already more expensive then better drives. Not to mention the loads of time wasted and lack of quality/space suffered when converting a file.Treat this as a DVD/CD combo drive. Reads DVD's, Writes and Reads CD's."
5,It's a definite must get for all you motown lovers!,"I'm not familiar with motown but this gave me a good taste of real music. I especaily like ""Papa was a Rollin' Stone"". So order this cd of motown masterpieces today. (it wasn't all that great)"
3,Size misrepresented,"Pans are actually 13x9 and will not fit in a toaster oven unless you mutilate them like I had to do. I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing them. Otherwise, a good sturdy pan."
5,Excellent Help!,"This book takes a thorough, yet quick look at United States History. It starts out with the exploration of Europeans in the Americas, highlighting the first encounters with the Europeans and Indians. It discusses all major (and not so important) events for the reader. Its ninteen chapters ends with the Reconstruction Period. This book seems to be more of a resource for a research paper than a novel, but I was able to read it like a book by Dickens. It taught me things I didn't know and helped me to pass my History courses with A's. This book is great for educators and students alike. I really recommend this resource to all!"
4,This was a cool book,"I really liked this book. There was some disapointments, though. I knew right away where the manuscript was and I thought it was pretty dumb that no one else in the houe knew where it was. But I didn't know who the killer was. I still liked it though!"
3,Come into his parlor ...,"Hillyard is a friendly, engaging writer and his book is fine bait for any arachnophile. But he purports to be passionate about spiders, and this book doesn't show it. It's entirely too light on its subject ... for example, there isn't a single technical drawing or close-up photograph in the whole book. Color plates for those fantastically varied species? None either. And the next-to-last chapter on significant spider classifiers, those English country parsons, is really a snooze. The most significant problem is the lack of a chapter on spider myths, an odd omission for a subject as murky and maligned as spiders. He could have broken some new ground, as well ... For instance, the hobo spider, a wholly new venomous species, is spreading through the Pacific Northwest ... how did it get here? Who found it? When do people bump into it, and how does it behave? What is its future?"
2,A shoddy production,"This book is a shamefully shoddy production that shows no evidence of there having been an editor, or even a literate author. Extraneous words are left in. Other words are missing. There are many typos and misspellings. Apparently no proofreading at all was done. The subject, Dr. Nibley, deserved better. For an example of how it should have been done, see the superb book "" Sergeant Nibley, PhD ""."
3,Going back to the way you are,"This book is great for Native/Alaska American who want to get intouch with you they are. To let go with the anger of the past. Not only of what the settlers have down to the Indians,but they can incoorprate it into their own lives. To live as Native american in todays world.Other Non-Indians can learn from this book to heal from their past and use the tools the Author has given in their own lives as well."
1,"Horrid, Horrid and just plain Horrid","I honestly do not even no where to begin with this jumbled mess called a film. I will just make a long review short. I recognized that I was going to be watching a ""B"" movie film but this mess would have pushed past a Z if it were possible. Horrible writing, lighting, acting, camera work, editing & pacing teamed with a laughable set will have you wondering if this film was done by a bunch of drunk meth addicts. Moreover, speaking of the set, why did the police station just look like an old boiler room? In addition, why did they just slap a number precinct sign on the front of a truck dock and try to act as if it was supposed to be a police station. Everyone involved in this blunder/production should be in hiding from embarrassment. Please avoid this like syphilis!"
1,"MAN, WHAT A TURKEY LOL!","This has to be the stupidest piece of garbage I've ever seen. Nothing at all like the cover suggests.Horrible acting, NO ZOMBIES - unless you call chicks with bad eye liner zombies LOL!Cardboard & plywood makeshift sets thown together in an empty warehouse (reverb echoes and all), props from a Good Will store...looks like it was made on a $20 budget. Luckily, I only RENTED it. Kiss that $4 bucks goodbye LOL!Why, oh WHY would anyone even MAKE something so dumb? On a scale of 1 to 10, this total waste of plastic comes in at -99."
1,"When I become a zombie, I want to be a guardian angel...","Truthfully, this movie is a fried slice of heaven. I'm not surprised people find it hard to understand the genius whom is Ulli Lommel. I mean, other than the obvious plot holes and even the irrationality of even yes, a zombie movie... this movie has Oscar potential."
1,"PD, Low Quality Junk","It seems the only hope to sell this DVD is by adding ""tags"" when users search for other cartoons that have NOTHING to do with these PD junk.These are old Public Domain Cartoons of very low quality. They have been passed around for years on VHS to make a quick buck and now on DVD.Not worth buying."
2,Mom: 'We read it every night!',"This book has it all - for adults and children. It's an interesting story, told humorously, with beautiful illustrations. Best of all, my two year old loves it. For a month now we've been reading it every night. She never tires of it. Amazingly, neither do I. Highly recommended."
4,A favorite,"We read this book at bedtime with our son. He loves dogs. The book's hero is a boy who really wants a dog. He gets his wish with a little help from a dragon. We're now waiting for our son to find a dragon too, so he can have his dog! He identifies with the hero, he thinks it is him! We were delighted one evening whe he pointed to the boy and said ""me""."
1,Very poor quality - leaked almost instantly,"This air mattress is low-priced for a reason. I used it once, and my guest wound up sleeping on the floor within a matter of hours. This is just not acceptable for a new product, so back it went."
1,Bad quality,"It breaks down very fast. I would not recommend this item, even after the many positive reviews by others. I had it for less than a month and then one fine day it stopped working. Now that it doesn't work I spent a while searching for more reviews and other people have the same complaint. Do not spend your money on this."
1,Disappointing,Segmental movie showing chopped scenes of a person and his girlfriend going to Sturgis. I was greatly disappointed with the entire movie which was absent of scenes of Sturgis and mostly small clips of them together and a few of others encountered upon the way. It is not clear if they made it to Sturgis and contains very little riding coverage.
2,Pretty much sucked.,"I was hoping to see a video about bikes or Sturgis. Instead, this is mostly about an annoying self proclaimed ""biker"" and his girlfriend riding to Sturgis in segments. Also includes an older guy talking about how great he is. Don't waste your time or money."
2,I should have been out rideing,"This movie truly Blew Chunks...This dude must have been the first R.U.B. in the American Biker Culture. What a Bozo, talking about the ""HARLEY GODS"" I can not believe the gal kept rideing with him...In the end they get married. I would like to know if they are still married and if he is still rideing. Don't waste your time with it...unless you are in a COMA!"
5,Biker Dreams,"This film about a young couple on their way to Sturgis in 1996 was very pleasing. The characters also showed are funny, interesting and sincere people. I've been to Sturgis once,in 2003, and it was nice to see some familiar places. Recommended"
4,Easy to swallow and good dose,The only thing I can really review about this product--since I am not qualifies to attest to the efficacy of glutamine--are the physical attributes.1) The pills are easy to swallow2) The dose of 750mg allows one to take 1500mg--a common suggested dose for glutamine--in just 2 pills
5,the Mob is Back,"Bought it the first week and it doesn't leave the deck. I really dig the album. I was really bothered by the fact that the group lost a member. But all in all its a great buy for true Goodie - Fans. I think some people need to realize that artists grow just like we do. And for them to make the same they music that they did 10 years ago is obsurd. Of course Soul Food was a classic, but then again...it was the first of its kind. Now you have 3 other albums to compare to that... and nuts. None of them sound the same You need to compare it to whats out now, which is utter garbage. I didn't hear anything in this CD slamming Suga Baby. All in All I love the CD. And I can't wait to Gator drops some DF funk too."
4,Anthropological view,I ended up buying this book because a Professor of my Anthropology class liked it. I really liked it! It was fun to read after learning about Sex and Gender. I felt you could really see the culture of this time and place. I felt like the Author really knew about that time period. The story was fun too. Overall a good read.
5,This will BLOW you away!,"Oh wow. It takes C batteries, which is nice cause it adds some weight to it and some serious POWER! I like the length and the girth, not too small. This thing has multiple speeds; lowest, low, medium, fast and VROOM! First time using it I had an orgasm in 30 seconds, no lies, and I only had the thing turned up half way! LOVE THIS! This is a must have."
1,Junk...I don't understand why it received positive reviews...,"I bought this along with two other toys (Doc Johnson Velvet Touch Vibe 7"" and the Lelo Gigi) thinking, since this took C batteries, it would be more powerful. Wrong. It is really quite weak, much weaker than the Doc Johnson which takes AA. And it sounds like a damn lawnmower. Very embarrassing and distracting. I'm glad it was only 12.00, because it's going straight in the trash. Amazon does ship discretely (I have seen a lot of people ask that, so I'm throwing that tidbit in). I also purchased a Lelo, which while pretty expensive was worth every penny. If you want something attractive, discrete, quiet, and shaped well, go with that gold standard. They may not be quite as powerful as some battery operated versions (these charge via outlet), but they offer enough power and are really QUITE lovely...wish I would have gotten the Liv instead of the Gigi based on shape, though."
1,Waste of money,"I'm not sure why this thermometer gets such great reviews. It's unintuitive to use - the buttons and the order in which you should hit them, the point at which the temp has stabilized, the basic use is just completely unclear. On top of all that, its terribly slow, taking longer to reach a stable reading as our old fashioned dial meat thermometer. Top it off - it's not at all durable. Two years in and the lcd screen died for no clear reason."
2,It was OK,"It was Ok. It was cheaper than I thought. I went ahead and bought a more expensive, better fork."
2,Digital Fork Thermometer,"The Taylor 807 Weekend Warrior Digital Fork Thermometer has one drawback. It takes far too long to register the actual temperature. Although it does register an accurate temperature,it is not an instant read by any definition. Therefore, I wouldn't recommend it unless you don't mind standing over the grill or at the oven holding it in place while it registers."
5,Alluring,"You can't go wrong with this fragrance. My Lady Loves It, and I Love when she wears it! This fragrance makes her even more irresistible! I also recommend the perfume to go with it! Amazon had the best price I could find. Shipping was rapid even though I ordered around the holidays."
3,OK for the price,This is exactly what I expected for the price. It worked just fine on my last 5 day camping trip but deoderant is a must have.
4,Adorama Body Cap for Pentax K Mount Cameras,"There is really not too much to discuss here. As many of us are moth balling our older film cameras, we are discovering we have misplaced the body caps. In my case, I converted my Pentax lenses to work with my DSLR set up and wanted to store my Pentax body - along with my other cameras that will one day soon be valuable to museums only. This product works perfectly. My only complaint is value. Given the original, I could reproduce these in my house for less than 10 dollars a pop. A production facility should be able to make these for less than a dollar each. And yet, as you can see, the retail is far above either (EDIT: At the time of writing, the retail was well over ten USD). Still, if you need it, you need it."
2,"Chipped quickly, but Lodge replaced for free","The bottom inside of this dutch oven chipped very quickly for me. I kept using it for years anyway, but eventually the chipping became bad enough that I contacted Lodge about my options for repairing it. Instead Lodge replaced it for me for free!"
2,Disappointed with this product,"Being in the market for a 7 qt. enameled cast iron dutch oven, the 7 qt. Lodge appeared to have the right stuff with 4 coats of enamel, substantial weight, attractive appearance and some cost savings. However, when it arrived I was very disappointed with the quality. As other reviewers have noted, the bottom was not flat and the pot would actually rock on the stove top. There were 3 pin-hole defects in the interior enamel resulting in exposure of bare metal. Cosmetically, the exterior enamel was uneven. Would these issues effect cooking ability? Maybe not, but this product apears to be a cheap chinese knock-off. So, I have returned this $165 (Amazon price) item and went out a bought a $250, 71/4 qt. Le Creuset at a local retailer - note that this price differential is $85, not $100+ or ""double "" the price as stated in some reviews. And the Le Creuset is perfect."
4,Love it!,"I haven't had this for very long, but I'm impressed by its sturdiness and utility. I've made braises and soups in it and love its ability to go from cooktop to oven. Considering that it costs much less than Le Crueset, this is a great deal."
2,It crawls at 1.5X after two weeks!!!,"Bought this dvd-rom as a back up to my dvd writer. It came with PowerDVD, which seems to be more versatile than WinDVD. I noticed that it originally read at above 8x max but now it is constantly at about 1.5x, which defeats the purpose of my purchase because it's now reads slower than my dvd writer that rates at a slower read speed! The program that I use to rip dvds for backup always show something in the buffer, sometimes as much as 50%! My computer slows down to a crawl whenever this dvd-rom is used to rip a dvd; doing something like surfing the web seems to be a chore. You should think about buying some other dvd-rom drive if your purpose is not to watch movies only."
2,Great sax solos sorely missed and needed ! !,"As a follow up to their 1st album ""One and Only""I can only say that I feel Big Daddy Weave left a lot of holes on ""Fields of Grace"". Gone are the soaring sax solos and even the mix has the sax in the background except for the final song. Maybe the mixers at the new label don't understand what a ""lead solo"" sax player is. Think of jazz and the groups of the 60's and 70's., soul and funk and the predominance of horns, not just as backups, but as much soloists as guitars and organs. Their 1st album nailed it. This album leaves them,without the sax-loaded songs and soloing,just another ordinary pop christian group.Even when riffing behind the vocals,the guitars and rhythm are louder than the horn.Bring back the horn-- you don't hear enough good sax players nowdays. They have one --- use him and mix him properly. Let your group stand out from the others with its unique horn-loaded sound."
3,Harry Pierpont,"Having researched Harry for over 25 years, it is good to see a book come out on him, even if it is a novel. It made him appear more human, which all the history and John Dillinger biographies haven't done so far. A guy who lost out on the lime light due to the Dillinger fame...Pierpont was a clever and rather brilliant criminal in his own rights and if he had eluded the police in Tucson of 1934, he may well have made it to the FBI ""hit"" list right along with Dillinger. Tempermental and highly complexed...Pierpont had all the makings of a famous criminal mind. So sad that history has left him behind."
4,Bayou Blues,"Strangely, this book was awesome. I read a couple of the other Dawson's Creek books before, but I liked this one even better because of the suspense. It was really fun and suspenseful. I've read tons and tons of TV-related Young Adult novels, and this one is far away the best. Most are really, really cheesy, but ""Bayou Blues"" actually reads like an actual novel written by writers with actual talent. It's definitely a fun read."
2,The show is good,"The show is actually good and fun to watch, but it was not on Amazon Prime so I had to pay extra for it. A good show but not that good"
1,What ignorance!,"I was enjoying this book until I got to page 31, in which the author writes about someone she knew who had schizophrenia. She says, ""Most important difference between a schizophrenic and a psychic? Most psychics are not disturbed people. They look like you, they look like me, they go to the opera, they go to the movies, they make meat loaf and ski at Aspen."" I suffer from schizo-affective disorder (which is kind of a mix of bipolar disorder with some schizophrenia). I look like you, I go to the movies, I could ski at Aspen. This book is supposed to open people's minds! There are AMAZING anti-psychotic medications that completely change the lives of many people like me. Even someone who is suffering from schizophrenia, without medicine, is not some kind of scary creature that should be hidden from the world. We mentally ill people are people just like you. Shame on Sherry Suib Cohen. I hope this review has been enlightening."
1,Garbage and overpriced,Do not buy this product. When microsoft transitioned to vista a lot of this software did not work with it. I wrote the company and the company never responded to these issues even though my software was only 1 month old. What a big disappointment.
5,THIS BOOK IS HOT!!!!,"I came across this book while finding myself wandering into a Christian bookstore. The information/informativeness of this book is out-of-sight! You won't learn these things by just going to church or reading your Bible (the Bible is truly complex!). This book will give you a better understanding of the scriptures in its relation to angels, demons, and the devil himself. Alot of things I hadn't a clue about until reading this book. I haven't finished it yet, as I have just started, but once you begin, you won't be able to put it down...This book answers alot of spiritual questions and problems I've had, especially concerning angels (good and evil) and explaining what demons really are."
4,Sinister Detective,"The brutal cable tie murders in the Sinister Detective come at you with a bang, one after another. Jef Lynch comes out punching with a real thriller. The fight game, the mean streets, and the seedy bars are a fitting backdrop for the tough characters who make up this fast moving, easy reading, murder mystery."
2,You don't even get what you pay for.,"If you want a functional daily use vanity, this is not the one. The first one came with the top smashed up during shipping. The seller (not this one) stood by the product and did an excellent job shipping a replacement. The part on the legs that you screw the bolts into aren't set at the proper depth. One leg only has one bolt in it. I hope it holds. The drawer is not on a track, so when you open it, it sort of falls forward. The drawer is of course made out of particle board and has started to split in the first day of use. I would return it if I wouldn't lose so much in shipping. Not a good product at all."
1,More like .5 stars,"This game is by far the worst game I have ever played. It was by far the worst game I have ever played. I would go to my storage and dig out my old Atari before I ever consider playing this game again. To repeat what others have said, the driving control is absolutely ridiculous. Racing games, for the most part, tend to exaggerate the physics of driving, but I have never seen a game that made them worse. On top of that, the purpose was altogether non-existent. Who wants to run around a small section of town crashing into buildings and picking up coins along the way? COINS!!! Please do not buy this game... I don't want to see a Maury Povich show about people who bought this game and then killed themselves."
2,Top Gear Dare Devil,"Actually, it's more like Top Gear Where the ... is the Fun Devil. Sure, you get cool looking cars, but they don't turn very well. So, it is kind of hard to do the missions. You gotta use hand brakes and stuff, which is cool, don't get me wrong. But it also is nerve racking cuz it takes a while to get used to. Well, the single player missions are not satisfying, and the multiplayer is not that fun after all. One thing is for sure, the graphics are well done."
2,Weak Interpretation,"This book attempts to combine fact with fiction to explain the story of the Pied Piper. It epically fails. It is easily seen that the book is geared towards younger readers by how it explains vocabulary every few pages. The story plays out too quickly and seems unrealistic, even for fantasy. There is not nearly as much background information as was needed. I only bought this book to learn more about the legend of the Pied Piper and how the authors would view him. His and the main character Calcephony's background stories are too weak to be part of a good story. They were both static characters, even after the climax. The Pied Piper was seen as mean and selfish, with no real depth other than being old and of Faerie. I do not recommend this story. However, if you do not mind a weak plot with subtle but annoying foreshadowing, go ahead and read it."
1,Poor quality material,The ring is beautiful. The quality of the ring however is poor. My husband was wearing the ring for three weeks when he picked up a pebble and was tossing it in his left hand when the ring shattered into five pieces. Hematite is poor quality and should only be worn on special occassions.
1,WARNING,This ring is very fragile I have only had mine for about 2 weeks and it has broken. Once your ring breaks its gone for good. I was very disappointed when this item broke in two. If it breaks and you want a refund the company Gem Avenue wrote this item is fragile. If you want to wear this ring 24 hours a day or during the day i would not suggest buying it.
4,heated mattress pad,The mattress pad works well to keep my feet warm. The only negative is the fit. My mattress is thick and the pad just barely fits. It slips off the corner often.
3,Warm but not hot,"Pros: warms the foot end of the bed with extra heat. Fits OK over my 13"" mattress.Cons: takes at least 30 mins to warm up, best switched on 1 hour before bedtime. I carefully followed the instructions but the left/right controls were reversed.Overall good value (total $73 inc shipping) and a product that performs well."
3,It does Keep me warm,"The Heated matress pad does do a good job keeping me warm, but you can feel the wires and the plug. It is cool how to give more heat to your feet and less to torso. It has cut my heat bill and that is why I purchased it."
2,specifications for item incorrect,The quality appeared OK but the measurements given during ordering were not correct and therefore I returned the bed warming pa because it didn't fir my mattress.
2,not worth the money,This product takes a long time to warm up and doesn't get very warm. I would not recommend it at all. Way too expensive for such poor quality!
5,"Finally, a warm bed.","I read the reviews on this item, pro and con, and it sounded like the right bed warmer for me. The new, safer electric blankets refuse to pre-heat the bed, but the mattress cover works like a charm. Crank it up for a half or full hour prior to bedtime, and you'll climb into a warm bed and be to sleep before you know it. The only problem I had was that the label on the remote was on the wrong remote. Fortunately I checked the heat in the morning and swapped the remotes and it works great. I got one for my son for Christmas and had him check his too. His controls were also mis-marked. Be warned and check before bedtime."
3,heated mattress pad,I was disappointed that it takes so long for the mattress cover to heat. You have to turn it on an hour or so before ready to go to bed.
1,Defective Product,"This electric mattress pad was great when it worked. It would not preheat the bed, it shut off shortly after it was turned on. It shut itself off during the night. Can't give it more than one star because it doesn't work."
2,short lived,"The bed warmer lasted one week before we were unable to heat both sides of the bed. This was the same problem with the original bed warmer (years old) it replaced. However, Amazon provided a replacement in an expeditious manner, and should this one not break, I would chalk the first one up as a manufacturing glitch and provide a better rating."
2,Heated Mattress Pad,Have/had two other versions of this type of product and in comparison was not that impressed with the performance. Although the unit did warm at the foot level it's function was almost imperceptable at the torso level. Not much more to say about it.
2,Not as wonderful as I thought it would be,"I purchased this product and much to my amazement, the dual controls are installed backwards!The control with the service label information is supposed to operate the right side of the bed, the unlabeled control is supposed to operate the left side of the bed. Not so. My side of the bed was too hot, hubby's side was too cold. When we swapped the controls to the opposite of what the directions said, we had the desired results. I purchased this product during the winter months, and needed it too much to send it back to the factory.....at my expense....for repair or replacement. Make sure any electric blanket or warming pad you purchase has at least a 5 year guaranty."
2,Don't often complain but....,I have not written many reviews although i often think I should. i certainly depend on them when i consider buying an item.My husband has severe rheumatoid arthritis and is often cold so we were looking for a dual control heated mattress pad. We already have a dual control electric blanket but he needed more.We bought the mattress pad in September. Last week it suddenly stopped working. It worked one night and did not work the next. I tried everything I could think of and nothing has worked. So we just bought a Sunbeam mattress pad in hopes that it will last more than 3 months!!!A final point about the Westpoint Stevens. I should have heeded the review that said it did not fit the bed well. it didn't; it was minimally manageable but tended to bunch.However the biggest concern is the lack of reliability of this item over time.
5,Love it!,"The duel controls are great, as my wife likes her side of the bed much warmer than I do - she can warm up her side without heating my side."
4,Well worth the money,"Purchased this as a gift for my wife - got the dual controls because I don't like being roasted and figured that I would just never turn my side on.Well, I was wrong. The unit is VERY nice for pre-warming the bed, which is what I use it for. It also works prety nicely in the morning to help me get out of bed - I crank the heat up and when it gets hot I get out of bed.The controls are very simple and easy to use, and it has a timer that turns it off if you leave it on.Well worth the money."
4,I love my heated mattress pad!,"My husband and I bought a king size bed for Christmas and needed a new heated mattress pad...this brand was well-priced and very affordable, and shipped very quickly! It only has five heat settings, and I usually turn it on about 20 minutes before I climb into bed. It definitely concentrates heat more towards the foot of the bed to warm my feet and I usually sleep with it on at 10-20% heat, rarely any more than that because it heats up so quickly. I love having dual controls (we were sleeping on a full-size bed before) and sleep much more comfortably than before. The only downfall is that it isn't quite deep enough for my mattress (which is only about 12 inches deep). Installation was easy, and it is a basic model. I am very happy so far (I've only owned it for about a month) and look forward to using it during future Michigan winters. :)"
3,Not quite,"The warmer works well, and the separate controls keep my husband warm, and me a little cooler. However, the King size would have fit a Queen better. It doesn't fit all the way to the bottom of the mattress."
3,Its a gamble on this one,"I bought this mattress pad this past winter and it worked VERY well in how much heat you can get but one of the remotes stopped working after about a month. Luckily it gives off so much warmth that if I turn one side on I dont really NEED the other side on,though it would be nice. Maybe I just got a defective one... either way its a decent product."
2,Worked Great While it Lasted - Didn't Last Very Long,"I ordered this product primarily for my wife because she is always cold. I liked the idea of separate controls for each side of the bed because I'm always warm. When I went to bed I would turn my wife's side on so it would be warmed up by the time she came to bed. It worked great and she was a happy camper. However, less than a month later the item quit working. I sent it back and received a refund."
2,"Product seems nice, but stopped working","I bought this for my girlfriend as a birthday present because she is always cold at night. The product seemed okay when we got it - maybe a little flimsy / thinner than our old pad, but okay. We put it on and it seemed to keep both of us warm at night. However, two days after we started using it, her side would no longer heat up at all - the control just flashed once and turned off. My side was still working. I'll be buying a different brand."
5,Pure Magic,This is a CD you will play again and again - it is a comprehensive collection of all The Guess Who favourites. So many good songs on a 2 CD album. Spanning from 1964 to 1975 there's so many memories to relieve as you replay these classic songs.
5,"Bag is well made, attractive and functional.",The bag is quite attractive and durable. It holds a laptop in place securely with ample padding. It has room for several books and accessories. A great purchase.tw
2,"not good, not a sequel. skip it u will thank urself and me.","storyline is just....i dont think there really is one. i liked the first ong bak. this one is getting 2 stars just because the fight scenes are very well choreographed. its not a sequel to the original at all, so dont think that u are missing something by not watching this. i can watch a lot of crappy movies n find some justification as to why i didnt wast my time by watching it, with this one i cant find any justification."
2,not as good as Ong Bak 1,I think this movie has like one good kick that is about it. This is like some confused epic Tarzan idk. dont expect all the great fight scenes like the first movie.
5,Great Sequel!!,"Even Though this film is actually more of a prequel then a sequel, it still rocks! Tony Jaa delivers another stunning performence, as he takes on the role of Tien. Some of the most realistic and crazy, insane martial arts I have ever seen in a movie. The only downside is the story isn't as straight forward as the 1st movie. The dvd comes with an alternate ending and a preview for Ong Bak 3. This is a must buy on Blu-ray, looks great."
4,Good sword fights and down and dirty martial arts.,"This movie has no connection to the original Ong Bak, except for the fact that it features Tony Jaa. I see Tony Jaa taking the path of Jet Li, Jackie Chan, etc. The story line is not easy to follow in this movie, but the fight scenes are good. They involve sword fights and Thai style martial arts. I personally liked the first movie better, but the action in this movie is also good."
5,Fantastic supplement to guide book,We LOVED this map of Paris for our trip. All of the major sightseeing attractions (the monuments & buildings) are drawn in 3D and to scale. This was VERY helpful to be able to plan a day of sightseeing. Metro stops are shown and helpful info about sights and stores are right on the map. Highly recommended!
5,Thought provoking,"This book takes a subject no one ever talks about, and casts some much-needed light on it. The author is full of fascinating information about what really goes on in a house of prostitution, and the whole thing is marvelously entertaining.The thing I liked best was the way this book goes behind the usual myths and folklore to tell what people actually do, and why, in a brothel.Another thing that is priceless, is the information about politics and how a state legislature interacts with prostitution businesses.""Follow the money"" applies here, because this author explains the financial considerations behind a house of prostitution, and how these places market themselves, and the customers they attract.What an eye opener! I was also amazed to hear what the ""tricks"" have to say about their experiences.I recommend this book to anyone who is curious to get accurate information, plus this is highly interesting reading. Once you pick up this book, you can't put it down."
5,"A balanced, insightful and at times moving book","It's too bad this isn't required reading for ""I've got my mind made up, don't confuse me with the facts,"" anti-prostitution people. Alexa Albert is a graduate from the Harvard school of medicine, and she brings a balanced, non-emotional, non-judgmental perspective to the topic of legal prostitution in Nevada (which is pretty rare for this topic). This book adds a candid, human dimension to the lives of sex workers. Highly recommended reading for anyone who wants the real story."
3,"good footage, no sound!","i was very excited about watching this, but to my disapointment, there is no real sound, except the clasical music, which isn't bad if you like that sort of thing. the footage is great, but if your like me with a loud surround sound system and want to hear the jets screaming overhead and scaring your neighbors into thinking there under attack by a flight of f-15s, dont buy! if you like to just watch and listen to somewhat relaxing music, then by all means, go for it!"
2,Stock footage with New Age music.,"I too enjoy the sound of 50,000 pounds of thrust screaming withthe afterburner lit. Unfortunately you will only hear one fly byduring the intro of the DVD. The music, while well performed is almost too restful, especially when you see an aviator sitting in the cockpit of an aircraft capable of Mach 2.5. The video quality was a little grainy, mainly because a lot of the footage was shot a long time ago.While some shots were quite unique, most were right from Discover Wings. This is ""nice"" for your aviation collection but not the edge of your seat DVD you might be expecting."
1,Bad Quality CD's,"I bought the two CD's - first Spanish songs and more Boca. It was a complete waste of money. I have borrowed better CD's from the library. The songs are old traditional songs, and they don't really teach anything that I thought they would - colors, numbers, etc. The recording itself was like it was made in a back room somewhere. Music is not Latin. It is definitely not an immersion type of Spanish, as it still has an American culture focus. For example, the songs are traditional English ones like, ""Skip to My Lou"", translated into Spanish. rather than Spanish songs with an English translation. I have taught English to kids in another country, and the method used on these CD's is not the way to do it - even for babies. Maybe Beth was considered innovative when she first started, and that's why she has so many awards, but that's not how things are done now."
3,OK until my laptop stopped booting up,"I've had this product for about a year. I like it pretty well as a stand for the laptop, but the USB port has recently started causing issues with my laptop. Specifically, I get nothing but a blank screen with a blinking cursor when if I try to turn on the computer with the USB hub connected. Everything works as expected when it's disconnected, and I guess I could turn on the computer, and then connect the USB hub, but it is not the way I want to work."
2,I tried to like this but....,"I was always a big fan of Two and a Half Men and I own the first eight seasons. I thought I would give the Ashton Kutcher version a chance. The show had it's moments but overall it was a totally different show. I started to watch Charlie's new show ""Anger Management"" and it actually felt more like Two and a Half Men than the ""Kutcher"" version. With the two shows being compared side by side it was obvious that Charlie Sheen was the reason for the Two and 1/2 Men success. Nothing against Ashton it's just Sheen elevates any material. I won't be buying this season and will continue to follow Charlie's new series..."
1,The death of a great series,"Wow: what a severe disappointment. Didn't it ever occur to the producers--when hiring a replacement for Charlie Sheen--that they needed someone who was actually funny? Apparently not. Kutcher probably has some desirable qualities (not sure what they might be), but being funny certainly isn't one of them."
1,Sheen is way better,this show was based around charlie sheen if you take him away its like taking away the show some of the episodes were funny but most of them are not funny alan is now carrying the show
2,disc,one of the discs skipped a little and did not work like i wanted. But other then that im satisfied
1,"Put your shirt on, Ashton. It's not funny.","Very simply: With Sheen's departure, they took a man's show and tried to make it into a chick's show. Unfortunate Fail."
5,Genius deserves recognition,"This CD is brilliant, original - a must have for any serious Blues/Jazz/African Music collector. Olu Dara merges all three genres with ease and grace."
5,This book was amazing!!!!!!!!,"I have never read anything like it! It is original, humorous, exiting, etc, etc! I have read the entire series plus the Malloreon and both of them were totally amazing!!!!! the way that David Eddings describes everything is great! I especially like the way the characters act towards eachother. To David Eddings I say:Way to Go Skipper!!!Thanks for listening, from Simon Molnar!"
3,A quality copy of the fantastic style pioneered by Tolkien,"Although the story has its merits, once in a while you can't help yourself getting the feeling that you are reading a book somehow mimicking the Lord of the Rings trilogy by Tolkien. However, it does this occasionally so that it does not prevent the reader enjoying the series."
3,Not exactly what I call good.,"It mystifies me that Eddings is a well thought of author.True ,he has an exellent plot,true ,he has good characters,but does it get anywhere?No!!!!!!!!!!I mean,if these books were called:A tour of the West Kingdom of the Angaraks volumes 1,2,and3,I'd understand.Because that'what it is .A tour .Eddings has some strange urge for you to visit every single little place that he's invented.It's annoying.So here's what it's like to read one of his books :You really begin to get into it,it's getting really interesting,then what happens is something really pointless that happens to take up aproximately 200 pages is put in.I began to wonder if it would get somewhere .The first three books had virtually the same plot!Taking out various parts ,these first three books could have been one book about ...what 400 pages long!If you want fantasy that GETS SOMEWHERE,try Brooks,Jordan,Feist,Donaldson,Norton,anyone but this Eddings fool!"
1,The Dunciad,"The writing is so shallow, the dialogue so rife with adverbial qualifiers, the characters so stilted, and the plot so derivative (orphan grows up in small village, must save world), that I won't waste much time reviewing Eddings. This is classic fantasy? It has no psychological depth. Its battle scenes are somniferous. Its structure is contrived. Think George R.R. Martin instead."
4,A good simple read,"I have to admit that when I started reading these stories, I felt the plot was somewhat slow. But keep going! the books are not all that long. You need to read through at least book 3, which is my favorite so far. Eddings writing gets better the further you read. While the storyline is not exactly original, the writing is good, and it's worth a read. If you like to read a book and enjoy it for the journey it takes you on, this is one of those books!"
5,Another Great Epic Fantasy!,"I am so happy to have read Eddings' first volume of the Belgariad. I couldn't put it down...much like the first time I read The Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter. First of all, Eddings writes well. Second, he creates memorable and (mostly) endearing characters. Third, he knows when to add a twist to the age old good vs evil plot. This is not a copy of any other fantasy novel. I've finished volume 2 and have started the Mallorean. I am so glad he wrote a lot of books!"
4,Still a Series that's a blast to re-read,"Every couple of summers I enjoy the chance to make the Belgariad my reading material for a week or two. The characters are still just as endearing, the dialog is still written just as wittily, and the pace moves just as fast - every time! Eddings did a great job at not trying to be too serious, at understanding the need to stick to a main plot line, and to really love his characters as he wrote them. Don't pass up a chance to come to know this series!"
1,No Instructions,"No instructins, web address not available in English. When ordering from Toys R Us you think you get a reliable product that comes with instructions. I will be returning this item.Wording on the box even has mispellings...makes you think you have bought a substandard product."
2,Honey Baby,"Honey, (Diana Sands), is on a vacation with her little brother, soaking up the sun and surf, when some really bad dudes spoils it all. Armed with only her wit and charm Honey manages to escape her perils. The acting is low key, as is the picture quality (VHS grade), but Calvin Lockhart adds to the action and entrigue and makes this movie a must have for all Blaxploitation movie collectors. There are other cover designs that show Honey holding a .50 caliber fully automatic machine gun, wearing a low cut hot pick/red blouse. Got to get it!"
2,For Supply Freaks Only,"Having been a Avalon Hill gamer from way back, I was looking forward to this game. My son and I have really enjoyed Guadalcanal, but this game is a trudge. The whole game revolves around supply and moving trucks around. Boring. We gave up."
5,Recognize Your True Face,"TrueFacedTrueFaced exposes our True Self by identifying through these pages God's desire for each and every one of us: to Love God and to Love Others. To truly find our True Face, we must recognize Grace, Love and Repentance, we must applaud vulnerability and exhibit authenticity, and we must learn to Trust God (versus simply Pleasing God) in what He says about us: He loves us and there is nothing we can do that could change this. Recognize, learn and discover in this book that we all have masks that shelter our True Selves, and God wants us to Trust Him and Others with who we truly are! An excellent read! I recommend it for any believer who searches for true identity in this world!Brandon PopeSpeaker & Author of: Spiritual lessons from WALL STREET[...]"
2,Some reservations,"I find it insightful. It peels off the layers of hypocrisy and exposes our inner world with all its thoughts of inadequacy, fears of rejection, struggling with sin, etc. It presents an honest picture with regards to the way we tend to act.I do have reservations with its theology, with the solution offered which I can sum it up like ""do not strive to become a better person and draw near to God because you are going to fail anyway - just think of yourself as already godly and from this point on it is God's responsibility not yours. Since a sinful life can not be avoided, just think of yourself as godly and call it normal"" This is Calvinism at its essence - once elected always elected, your effort does not matter and your behavior is irrelevant."
3,Did not really enjoy it,"This was a book that my women's group at church read.Did not really enjoy it, although I think it would be helpful for those seeking to work through unresovled emotional issues."
2,Kindle Version,"The book itself is very helpful, specially the mock exams in the last 2 chapters, however, the Kindle version wasn't completely in order. It seemed to me that pages got switched."
3,Would You Rather Be A Bullfrog?,"""Would You Rather Be A Bullfrog"" is a fun story all about decisiion making. From cat or dog to this or that, everyone needs to learn to make his or her own decsions. With rhyming words and adorable pictures, this book is a great read for all young children."
4,works will but funny smell,"This dries well but just as its warming up it produces an acrid smell that seems like burning chemicals. When it's hotter it's not as noticeable. Doesn't seem to be doing any harm, but it's distracting and I would probably pick a different one in the future."
4,So much better than my old dryer--when it worked,"I am very happy with this hair dryer. As advertised it is much quieter than other dryers I've owned--quieter on high speed than my old one on low speed. It does a good job, and it seems like my hair looks better when I use it--I used a travel dryer for a few days and thought I needed a haircut until I started using this one again. Lent it to a friend to try and she loved it too!editing my review on 12/12/07--the dryer has died. several times I would turn it off before I was finished drying my hair and it wouldn't come back on....well it did it again yesterday and now it is completely dead. after only a few months, and my hair is only chin-length, so while I used it daily it was not for long periods of time. now we'll see how getting a replacement goes--we've moved so I don't have the box, etc."
3,"Just another crappy hairdryer, they are all the same.","Gets too hot, burns out have to wait to turn it on again. Nothing special about this one, but I refuse to pay anymore for a freaking hairdryer. I go au natural to dry most of the time."
1,Disappointed,"I was excited to receive the product, but disappointed with the performance. I wore it to a bootcamp class and my achilles ached even more. I had to take the strap off. I tried wearing it to bed, no pain when I woke up. for me, it was a waste of money."
1,crap,"Did not help at all. Pinched, scratched and very uncomfortable. Cost too much. Would love to get my money back, don't buy."
1,Junk science,This item did not function as advertised. If not worn extremely tight it would slide down and be loose. If adjusted so it would not slide down the ankle it was so tightf it would be painful to my tendon within minutes. This item is junk and it hurt more than it helped. Save your money.
5,Trancing Mode,"As a pretty serious Depeche-Mode fan, I have to whole-heartedly recommend this album. Tribute albums are supposed to take music that we know and love and put an entirely different spin on it... The artists on this album do an exceptional job of interpreting Depeche without ever making the fateful mistake of attempting to copy them. If you like trance and like Depeche and are not a purist - this album is nothing less than a must-buy."
3,An OK step workout with a pretty good ab section at the end.,This workout is fun the first few times but then becomes very repetitive. The instructors mess up all the time and the camera man does a poor job. The only good things about this tape is that the aerobic sections are broken up between arm toning segments so it seems to go by faster and the ab section is a bit different from the average ab stuff.
3,Fantasy Hero Players & GMs,"Ok, you are going to need Fantasy Hero from Hero Games to really make use of this book. It is full of spells for the Fantasy Hero game. They are grouped by ""school"" and I found the book a good jumping off point for creating my own spells for the game.If you a Hero Games fan/ gamer, this book is a good buy. It's too bad that the books from Hero are so hard to buy from Amazon. I hope they will consider carrying more of them in the future."
4,"If you are sick of what's ""on the radio""...","This was the very first Selecter CD I'd ever heard, and I fell in love with it. I bought it immediately and although it's not the greatest when compared with OUT ON THE STREETS, it's still highly enjoyable. This is extremely old-school, two-tone ska, but I personally think in the background of some songs one can detect a hint of cheesy disco, perhaps. Just listen to it!"
2,NOT for a karaoke machine but great music,"Disney Karaoke, Vol. 3This CD is WILL NOT show lyrics on a karaoke screen. It is great if all you want is music. We bought it for a birthday party for my daughter in which karaoke was the main attraction. This CD has a booklet of tiny words with the lyrics. It WILL NOT show up on a karaoke screen. VERY disappointing."
2,no sing a long words displayed,"This is not CD+G. Which means, don't expect the sing-a-long lyrics to appear on your karaoke machine. If you have eagle eyes you can read the lyrics from inside the jacket cover."
1,False Advertising; This is NOT a Karaoke CD,"What a bummer! Without the onscreen graphic prompts, the CD is useless for karaoke. If you want accompaniment tracks, go for it. Otherwise, THIS IS A RIPOFF!"
3,Well......,Great but you need the WILSON ELECTRONICS 971119 Fme Male to Sma Male Connector to make it work. So I got to wait another 10 days - twice because the first adapter was lost. Why not put the *&#@&%$ adapter in with the antennae?? Dumb. Are they worried about losing the 10 cents it cost to add it to the package?? Works well once it is all together. Original antennae - no so much. This should be the standard antennae in the first place. Why ship a marginal product??? Bought for the Wilson Sleek Booster.
1,doesnt fit,doesnt fitthe booster i got from here. Got the booster kit an want an extra antenna but doesnt fit the booster..... even bought an extra male to female connection and that does fit ti....
2,wrong part,it was the fitting was not correct /.called the wilson rep. and told hin=m my problem. he was nice and sent a repacement. good to work with.
3,magnet mount antenna,I can't use the magnet mount antenna on the cell phone booster I purchased because they sent one with a male connector instead of a female connector. So I don't know if it works or not.
1,WRONG ITEM,I ordered the combo package and waited for two weeks to receive this antenna..the booster and home office package came with in a weeks times...how is it that I get the wrong antenna when I buy a package deal for the I-PHONE...and get the wrong parts???
5,A real book for real success,"I've read many ""Success"" books; some great, some weak.Chris Carey's book is one of the best I've seen. Its ano-nonsense, sometimes sobering guide to understanding whatit really takes to create change and realize goals in yourlife. This book builds as it goes with usable steps, realworld stories and concise recaps. Also happens to haveterrific quotes, humor and a conversational style. The authoris obviously a man who understands the big picture and can walk his talk. I particularly like his advice on repeatable successpatterns. Highly recommended to read and put into practice."
5,"If you liked ""New York City"" you're gonna' LOVE this!","This is basically the Norah Jones/Peter Malick ""New York City"" bonus version CD. I have both of them now. Amazing stuff. Man..the female vocals are just hypnotic. Really beautiful stuff. Check out the songs song by Mercy Malick. Does she have her own album coming out? You don't have to just be a Norah fan to really love this one! Check it out and enjoy!"
5,"Buy this!! Deserves the title ""Ultimate Collection""","GP beginners buy this.This CD contains many of GP's best songs (not all. impossible to cover them all in one CD anyway). They range from ""White Honey"" ---A-1 of his debut album--- to the unforgettable ""Disney's America"" from his '95 Album, all arranged in chronological order.Deep fans buy this too.I have been a GP fan for 25 years, and I can tell you that this CD has the best sound quality of all. Many of his classic songs sound much better than in the 25th anniversary re-issues released in 2001. Do not complain about the number of GP compilations, it's not this CD's fault. This collection deserves its title."
5,very nice watch!,if you are looking for a light weight watch this is the one for you.. i really love this watch its simple yet a lot of my co workers asre asking me about it.
4,"Stylish, could have more precision for a $42.00 watch.","Contrary to many of the reviews that I have seen, I have not had an issue with the band snapping. The watch looks great and has a unique Swatch style. My only criticism is that every month or so, the date number gets stuck between two different numbers for a day. Nevertheless, this is a unique item. I wear it as much as my Seiko 5, my Eco-Drive, and my quartz Seiko, yet it cost less than any of these. The crystal has not scratched in two months of ownership, although it is not as high quality as a Hardex or sapphire one would be."
3,nice but don't expect it to last too long,"Mine lasted about 3 or 4 years before it died with no hope of resurrecting. When it happened I was dissapointed at swatch. I'm pretty sure a Casio would last much more. However, I realized it is a $40 watch, there's not a whole lot to expect from it. It was practical while it lasted so I would recommend it if you want something simple, cheap, classic and light. Just don't expect it too last 10 years or may be I just got ""lucky"" with mine."
1,Non Responsive Seller - WATCH OUT,"Enjoyed the watch for few months. Very light watch and perfect for day to day use. However, the prong of the buckle broke in half. I was very much surprised for a Swatch to do that. I called Swatch customer service and they told us that I should contact the seller. First of all the seller does not have a direct number. They tell us to leave a message. We left many messages and yet to receive a call back. Very much disappointed in the seller. WATCH OUT. SELLER DOES NOT RESPOND AFTER THE PRODUCT IS SOLD."
1,Orphan Train,"I read the first two pages to my three year old son, which include the lines ""Parents coughing/Shaking chill/Stomachs aching/Deathly ill"" and promptly closed the book. I later read it to myself and almost cried. Depressing, not AT ALL suitable for children."
1,Brand New GirlFriend By Steve Holly,There is only one good song on this cd. The rest are not worth the money.
4,baseball shirt,was rounded bottom instead of curved...did not notice when it was purchased but will keep it....fit well and is similar to what I wanted
3,not the best quality but fine for the price,This raglan three quarter sleeve baseball t-shirt is not of the best quality and material but it is just ok for the price. It does weird folds in the neck area because of the rigidity of the material that is not very flexible and does not exactly adjusts tightly to the shape of your body. Shipping is pretty fast. Good communication. American Apparel sells better ones but you will pay 3 times the price.
5,A sad but touching story,I have read many books in my life but I will always remember this one. it is a VERY touching story. Most of the book is sad but not bad sad.
5,A touching story,"I just finished reading ""A Summer to Die"", it was a touching story, one that made me, a person who never cries, cry. The Ending and everything, was very surprising. This story is also written in first person, which helps you realize how the character felt and thought. If I were you I would buy this book, it will be one of those you can read over and over again, and cry over it every single time too!"
3,Great book - ridiculous price,"This is a nice introduction to Wyoming wildflowers and will work in surrounding states as well. However, it's now out of print and the sellers are trying to take advantage of the low supply and moderate-high demand. I recommend that until it's be reissued, that wildflower enthusiasts go to other floras. Many of the Rocky Mountain floras are helpful and I'd also recommend Montana, Nebraska, and Utah floras."
5,"Great book overall, highly recommended","I enjoyed this book thoroughly and easily read it in 4 days. I do have a criticism though. I doubt that 7th grade boys play basketball to this level of sophistication with pick and rolls, screens, no look passes, zone defenses, etc...Maybe a few do but it would be hard to get a whole league of them."
5,My favorite book!!!!!!!,"This book is about a kid who is a great basketball player but doesn't make his travel team because he is told he is too small. This book is my favorite book because of the great plot. I was disappointed that this story wasn't real. I do not read that often but this book was so good that I have to write a review. Mike Lupica, who is a great sports writer for the daily news really out did himself on this on."
3,alright,"I needed this book for a summer reading assignment and i didn't feel like buying a brand new book for something I am going to read just once. A little scratched up and torn a little (just on the cover), but there is nothing wrong with the writing or the pages. Overall you can read it with no problems."
2,"1/3rd TERRIFIC, 1/3rd FAIR, 1/3rd BAD","AMONGST THE MANY PAGES OF INCREDIBLY BORING, REPETITIVE, UNNECESSARY CONVERSATION, THERE'S A NICE LITTLE STORY ABOUT A 12 YEAR OLD WHO ""BEATS THE ODDS."" DITTO FOR THE YOUNGSTERS FATHER. UNFORTUNATELY, TODAY'S YOUTH NO LONGER PLAYS THE GAME IN THE MANNER MR. LUPICA DESCRIBES - ALTHOUGH, LIKE HIM (WE'RE ABOUT THE SAME AGE) I WISH IT WAS. THIS WOULDN'T NECESSARILY BE A PROBLEM IF MR. LUPICA DIDN'T SET THE TALE IN THE YEAR 2004.THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT PIECE FOR THE AUTHOR TO HAVE DEVOTED AN ENTIRE COLUMN OR TWO IN HIS DAILY NEWS PIECES, OR AS A PIECE IN THE DAILY NEWS SUNDAY MAGAZNE SECTION - NOT AN ENTIRE BOOK...ALTHOUGH, HE'S SURE TO MAKE A HELL OF A LOT MORE MONEY FROM THE BOOK (WHICH I IMAGINE WILL BE MADE INTO A MOVIE -IF NOT IN MOVIE HOUSES, IT WILL POP UP SOMEWHERE ON TV)."
1,Not for heavy chewers,"My 1 1/2 year old black lab just loved this toy for about 30 minutes, which was all it took before he was able to remove chunks from the ends. He Is the sweetest mild mannered pup but I still cannot find toys that he cannot destroy. He has even managed to remove a large chunk out of the side of the giant Kong. This is only for mild chewers."
4,"Good view of ""passing""","I'm somewhat biased from having studied under Dr O'Toole who is a friendly and generous scholar. That said this book is a good microhistory of one families experience at ""passing"". There's a fairly deft handling here of identity politics as the Healy sibling redefined themselves from being Black to being Catholic and white. There is an assumption that the siblings Black heritage should be just as important as their Irish heritage, and at times the book is a little sad as many of the Healy siblings very forcefully turn their back on their former Black identity. The book is fascinating both as the reconstruction of a 19th century family (which is the direction from which I approached it) and as an examination of the fluid nature of identity in America."
1,The Survival of Bigotry,"The large, extremely intelligent, and admirable Healy family is treated badly by an author who doubts the sincerity of vocations and religion in general. Far from ""passing for white,"" the Healy brothers suffered double persecution; by birth they were despised as both Irish and African, and by religion they were despised as Catholic in a virulantly anti-Catholic America. They were illegitimate according to American laws, though they were legitimate in a Europe that accepted the interracial marriage of their parents. Patrick Healy became a Jesuit not to ""pass for white,"" but out of love. He became President of Georgetown University. James and Sherwood Healy became secular priests, and James died Bishop of Portland, Maine. This author is as narrow-minded as 19th c. ""Know Nothing"" Nativists in his attitude towards truly good people."
5,Nice product,"Haven't had much chance to use it for legitimate reasons, but so far it seems to work great. So far I have used it to confirm a sticking brake caliper on my truck, the surface temperature of my cat, and to see just how hot the water coming out of my tap really is."
2,The only thing they took away was my money,"I bought this mainly for the video, as I already have the title song on another album. The video can only be played on a computer with the right software (not included; forget about playing it on your DVD). On top of that, there was no sound. Save your money."
3,The Mission Bell,This copy was in the condition that I expected. This was a donation to our local library for the children in the community.
3,Easy Reading,"I got this book by almost by accident waiting for one of those Japanesse Fish barns to open.It explained many of the issues that occur in OO development - problems with extreme re-use - fragile base class problem, ""changing the way you do business"" and many others. I actually found these non-component chapters in some ways more useful than the others.Then went on to discuss components in a very concrete and thorough way. It gives enough info in order to make a real judgement on whether to embrace components or not.I would buy it again for either of the two reasons."
4,"Good book, but kind of all over the place content wise","This, like the other Jewelry books by Codina have great visual content and show interesting techniques. Unlike the others, some of the information is nearly useless to the average studio jeweler. Some chapters are more like Mr. Rogers where you go see how something is made, but you would never make it yourself because of the equipment required.Small chapters on Image and Photography were happy little additions.Over all the book was more ""look how"" than ""how to"" but it's still a nicely put together book at a great price."
1,Simba Vet Kiit,This product is way too expensive for what it is. A bunch of plastic Dr. kit pieces and a plastic dog carrier that breaks the munute the door opens. No different than a regular play Dr. kit except there is a tiny plush dog. Value of the Simba Vet Kit not worth more than $10.00. I do not recommend it and certainly not durable or suitable for toddlers.
5,The Little Lady Who Started It All,"Before the diaries and journals of Sylvia Plath, May Sarton, Katherine Mansfield, Virginia Woolf, Alice James and others - there was the genius sister (of poet William Wordsworth), Ms. Dorothy Wordsworth. In her time especially (the 18th century to early 19th century), women were not taken seriously as would-be authors, poets, scholars or little else. The diary and belle lettres were their only outlet for such gifts. Dorothy was no stranger to sex discrimination so she hunkered down to record in the most gorgeous prose-poetry you have possibly ever read - her life and times travelling about Scotland and Europe as a lady of wealth, style and panache with her brother William and a few very famous companions I can't give away here. If you can afford it, purchase this book and her other two diaries-""The Grasmere Journals"" and ""The Continental Journals."" They are all page-turners."
5,Incredible work,"I'm a little late the the Philip Glass party, but this album is one of the most incredible things I've ever heard.Orion features a virtuoso soloist from each continent playing and having their moment.The entire (quite lengthy) runtime is dynamic and captivating."
1,"Wheeeew, that was nasty!!","Terrible...the mixing is bad, the tracklist left me wanting, the energy just isnt there. True trance fans already know what im talking about...just looking at the tracklist, hopefully they know better. Buy up if you're one of the ""MTV hyped a few 'techno' songs, so ill go buy a CD"" people..."
4,Reprint - not original,"I bought this poster because I used to have the same one back in high school. When it arrived, it was smaller than I expected and I could tell it was a reprint of the original. But it is a nice poster and it arrived quickly in protective packaging."
4,pretty good so far,I've only used this once but my guest said it did not deflate at all that night. The only problem I had was that we didn't know you had to charge the battery for several hours before you could use the pump to inflate the bed. It was really quick to inflate once the pump was charged. The material seems to be very sturdy too.
5,College student,"In this story, Joseph has an overcoat that is worn and old. He makes the overcoat into a jacket. As the story progresses, the jacket becomes a vest. The vest becomes a scarf. The scarf becomes a necktie. The necktie becomes a handkerchief. The handkerchief becomes a button. In the end, the button is lost. Joseph writes a book about his overcoat down to his lost button. He claims that you can take nothing and make something.The pages in the book have cut-outs. Children can use their imagination and guess what Joseph will make next. There is more to this story than the text itself. The reader should look at the illustrations and read the newspaper clippings. There are several cultural items in the illustrations that a teacher could use to discuss the culture. I truly enjoyed this book."
5,joseph had a little Overcoat,This is another great children't book. I like how the pages are cut out so you can see what he made from what he had previously. The pictures tell a lot of the story and let children use their imagination.
5,"Favorite for me as a child, hopeful favorite for nephew to be","My sister-in-law had a children's book themed baby shower (she is a teacher, can you tell?) and asked every guest to bring their favorite book as a child. This was my pick. I have the first edition of this book and LOVED IT as a child.I love the illustrations in this book. The bright colors and simple words brought me to the deeper message years later as I learned to read myself. Showing how time passes, things change, and these aren't bad things. And the most important message...Life is what you make of it!I hope my soon-to-arrive nephew comes to hold this book as dear as I do."
5,Still a great read 16 years later...,"Originally published in 1989, Guy Gugliotta and Jeff Leen have written an astonishing account of the rise of the Medellin cocaine cartel. The book is well researched and the pacing keeps you turning pages. The authors were able to connect a number of separate dots which give the reader a clear picture of the enormity of the drug trade in the late 70's and early 80's. The organization of the drug lords (Escobar, Ochoa, etc.), the men aligned against them and the other bit players caught in between are all brought to life in a fascinating and well written book."
4,love it but...,"I really see results from this product, but you have to continuously use them to do so. Also the last two shipments I received in the mail had melted some of the vitamins, which I ended up sending back."
2,Worked for about 8 months,"It worked for about 8 months then crashed. I still buy caviar blacks though, actually this is my fourth to crash haha... I had two 250s for my laptop, a 1 terabyte, and this 160. They work until they die."
5,Hmmm...do you possibly work for VWR?,"I have never had any problems with Fisher Scientific that were not resolved in an extremely timely manner, I have found their website extremely useful (www.fishersci.com) and have never had anything but pleasant interactions with their customer service, which makes me wonder whether the review entitled ""Incompetence at Fisher"" was possibly written by someone at VWR."
5,Sectaurs Warriors Of Symbion #1,This comic is very interesting to read. I am glad I was able to buy it.
4,Complete,This book is fairly complete. It has extensive detail when it comes to explaining the contents of the book
5,Amazing!!!,"I have known Rose for over ten years but, I never knew this side of her!!! She watched my sons out of the goodness of her heart and never complained or took money from me. I have always known that she has a passion for life but never did I imagine that her passion for children and humanity went to the levels of my readings in this book! I actually read it twice so far!!! I read part of it to her grandson and we laughed as it is so her!!! Amazing must read on dealing with life's struggles and over coming what we have been dealt! Good or bad! There is a way and its called hope and persistence!!! A MUST READ!!!"
4,Rebbie Jackson,"Good 80's-90's type of cd. Rebbie has a feathery voice just like the rest of the Jackson's (unlike the last review who said she had a powerful voice on Centepid-Sorry, that is Martha Wash singing along with her to make her sound better.) Has a couple of good hits-Fork in the road, Centepid, & Sweetest Dreams. All & all, pretty good."
1,"Masterful Translator, but No Zen Master","The problem here is that while Cleary is probably the best-ever translator of Buddhist literature, he is no Zen master. His translation of the actual text of the Mumonkan is supurb. Unfortunately, he gives lengthy commentaries on the cases. He's clearly not a Zen Master, nor a koan student, nor even a Zen Buddhist. He's a well-read translator who hasn't engaged in koan study.As someone who is personally struggling with Joshu's Mu, Case 1 of the Mumonkan, I can tell you that Cleary is even farther away from it than I am. He's clearly wrong about it. Why buy a book on koans from someone who has never done koan study?"
4,A Classic...revised,"I will say two things about this book:[a] The information the author provides is quite extensive, and he also showcases the work of numerous photographers, and it is quite helpful for people w/ my skill level (which I would tag @ beginner/hobbyist).[b] Having owned a prior edition, I am glad that the editor retained the image on page 148, which is the reason why I developed (no pun intended) an interest in photography in the first place. You will have to buy a copy to find out why.All in all it is an excellent choice."
1,bit,"nice book, but I'm in to digital, too bad,If your intentions are to establish a portrait studio (sears or walmart type), learn the basics of lighting, or the basics of digicams, forget it."
1,Save your money!!,"Like a lot of people here, I thought maybe...just maybe, it would really work. I eagerly ordered it, awaited its arrival and then read the instructions before getting ready to rid myself of household odors. Unfortunately, all I really had was a nice paperweight. It gets rid of NO odors, it does not attract smells - it does nothing except sit where you put it, like some type of decorative paperweight. Take my review seriously - save yourself some money - and just skip buying this hunk of junk. Take a loved one out to lunch, instead. It's a better way to spend your money, to be sure!"
3,Eh...,"I was hoping I would not need 3 layers of this polish to get the full effect of the look-it DOES look great after the 3 coats AND a good, shiny top coat. Mine did peel off in chucks but he next day, however. :-(. Maybe a good look for an evening out-that's about it."
1,"Lemon, want my money back","I have the Brome squirrel buster plus and multiple minis. They're well designed and constructed. Not this one. I hate it and gave up on struggling with it.First it had to be assembled so the the plastic seed tube fit into the base. That was harder than it sounds and harder than the instructions indicate. Second, the sliding shell with the perches get stuck in the down position so birds can't feed out of it anyway.Terrible design. It's brand new and I'm annoyed that I wasted money on this lemon.I'll stick with the plus, which I've had no trouble with and holds a lot of seed but is a tad ugly."
2,Squirrels are smarter than the makers of this feeder.,"No, maybe squirrels can't get inside the feeder, but they don't have to. All they have to do is shake it or set it to swinging, and seed goes all over the place. Then they take what seeds they want out of the resulting mess and leave the rest to rot. They can trash a feeder's worth of seed within a week. I'll be looking for yet another feeder as soon as I can afford it."
5,Squirrel Proof Bird Feeder,This bird feeder is great. The squirrels have not been able to knock it down or get the seeds. It arrived quickly and was a great price. I would recommend this bird feeder to everyone.
4,Goodbye squirrels!!,"I love this product! It solved my squirrel problems immediately. Easy to use, and easy to keep clean.!"
5,BEST for the price!,"We have so many squirrels, and they chew the feeder apart to get to the seed. With this feeder, we can enjoy the birds (ALL the birds) who come to our feeder. The doves and larger birds peck around in the spilled seed on the ground while the little guys fly in and out of the pine tree next to the feeder, taking turns on the perches. The mesh allows the clinging birds to feed as well. Any morning, we get about 30-50 different birds feeding and the squirrels don't even try any more. This feeder costs much less than the PLUS model, and it works great! It's easy to fill and it hangs by wire, so the squirrels are just out of luck!"
4,"Just a few ""cons"" to this feeder","Now that I've had this feeder for awhile, I have a few complaints about it although the feeder is overall a good deterrent to squirrels (not one has been successful at accessing the seeds in it). I live in a state where the winters can be very brutal, and you have to keep an eye on the feeder because if any ice/snow gets stuck onto the outside of it (weighing it down), it closes up the ports so the birds aren't able to feed. Also, you will have to go through your seed before you put it in to get all the sticks and debris bigger than a sunflower seed out or you will have trouble with it clogging up. Aside from these two things, the feeder is a good investment to keep the squirrels at bay!"
1,Wrong item sent,"I ordered this red spiderwort along with six others, each a different variety. It did not bloom the correct color, and the seller did not make it right, claiming that it might have been in too much or too little sun, etc.. Very disappointed with the seller - would love to have seen this in my Tradescantia collection."
1,"Sure, it's comprehensive... but it's not accessible.","If you are a scholar or pundit, this is the bible. BUT IF YOU PLAY IN A BAND AND WANT TO FIGURE OUT YOUR NEXT MOVE -- LOOK ELSEWHERE. Try Rich Stim's ""Music Law - How to Run Your Band's Business"" instead."
5,Fantastic movie about the conequences of messing with what you don't know.,"My friend and I, both admitted horror buffs weren't exactly sure what to do when this movie started. We declared it must be a comedy, as we watched a complete buffoon cast a summoning circle. We both lost it when the demon Lo made his appearance as he made rather sarcsatic and almost House like comments. While if you are expecting this movie to be a gorey horror film you are out of luck me and my fellow friend both agreed that this movie is well worth it to watch to the end. You will laugh, you may even say a coupe surprising awwws but I'm pretty sure I can say you will enjoy it."
1,Fooled by the four star rating :(,The movie( if you can call it that) was a waste of money and time..if i had known what i know now..i would not have sat through this movie even if i was paid to do so !!! it reminded me of high school plays were amature students want to pass as serious character actors!! i didnt even keeep the movie i shredded it :(
3,"A little cool, for a latin record.","This is a difficult cd to pin down. It has some great gems like In These Shoes, which I got hooked on listening to KGSR-Austin on the internet. But I also get the feeling that she didn't jump into the latin groove whole-heartedly. There is a reserve in her singing style that doesn't always suit the music backing her up; she cools down the heat. Basically, a few of these songs would be better as instrumentals."
2,tanning lotion,I am a routine tanned and purchased this product in hopes of getting a darker tan because it is a 'tingle' lotion. I was disappointed that it barely made me tingle and I didnt notice a big difference in color
5,dark,this stuff makes me alot darker in just one session. it is very easy to rub in and it smells great
3,The Dish,"Although this is a pretty good soundtrack for ""The Dish"" movie with many songs, it is still missing several songs used in the movie. The scalpers here are trying to apply some sheep dip to your backside. I highly recommend you wait until another edition of the CD is put out rather than succumb to this form of internet flim flam.CA Luster"
4,cereal sweetie,Aaron is like frosted flakes...us older people don't like to admite that we like him but we all know that is is gggrrreat!
5,Best book ever!,"Being a teenager, I often cant find reading material that strikes me as something I might want to read over. This book, however struck me as being one of those typs the moment I started reading it. I would highly recemend this book to anyone."
2,"Well, it is a book for young adults","This book is below par for clancy, but at the same time it was written for ""young adults"" which would indicate a very different audience than usual. I agree that Ruthless.com, and much of his early work is better than this book"
5,"Finally, a book on plot","Written for short story writers, this literary book gave me a lot to think about. There are many good writing guides on description, character, dialogue, etc., but none had addressed my struggles with plot. Originally published in 1977."
5,THE LONGBLONDES ARE SOOOO MOD!!,"sorry for the stupid cliche, but yes...if you want something new, fresh and beautiful, do not hesitate to buy this."
3,Worst sound quality I've ever heard on a CD,"OMG...What a crappy audio remix! Sounds like my decades old worn out 8-Track tape with the treble turned off and a bass that must have come from another band. I am sick. The only thing available from a great group and I get this. The selection of the songs is not too bad, but the sound quality is so poor that I am about ready to toss it in the trash and get out my worn - but still much better than this - LPs. Please, can someone reissue this with quality sound?I give it a 3 (5 for the great band and songs and 1 for sound quality)A good quality LP recorded directly onto CD would have been 10 times better. Too bad we can't get the early RCA LPs too."
4,Giddy-up little Pony!,"That was part of Jon Hendricks' lyrics to the song ""Little Pony"" about a too little known San Francisco alto player who was held in very high regard by all his peers. The evidence is all here on this 1962 session reissued on CD for the first time. This is an all-star sax session with Phil Woods, Gene Quill, Dexter Gordon, Clifford Jordan, Jimmy Heath, Pepper Adams and others joining Pony Poindexter on this boppish set. Nice arrangements and considerable talent and imagination went into this session, ""Pony's Express"" rides again on this Koch Jazz CD."
5,This car cover is absolutely perfect.,I researched several different covers before purchasing this car cover for my Toyota Sypder. It is a very good quality cover that has a custom fit. I am very pleased with it and highly recommend it.
5,Great Book!,"I'm an avid fiction reader, but for some reason I decided to try this book. It was a blast! I learned on a basic level how our universe works, and was entertained too! I highly recommend this book to anyone that likes to both learn and be entertained."
2,Lacking in many places,"The book is about time travel, yes. But it goes overboard on certain theories and ideas that don't really have a bearing on what the book should be about. Example, Gott goes on praising a theory of the creation of the universe, which he himself developed in 1998. His inflated ego is dripping on every page, in which he ""proves"" theories and ideas he developed himself, and leaves out other ideas or merely mentions them. He also spends a lot of time talking about time travel movies. I don't buy books like these to hear movie reviews. If you want to hear someone talk highly of himself and stray off topic, then by all means by the book. If you want to learn about time travel and physics, i recommend Hawking's A Brief History of Time, it goes into much more detail and is a lot more interesting (actually talking about time travel/physics without talking about himself)"
5,Product was as advertixed,Product was as advertised and delivery was quick. Would deal with this vendor again.
3,So-so threads,"The Bower (not Adorama) Step-Up Adapter Ring arrived fast but outside (lens) threads were defective (sharp, burrs) and wouldn't screw onto lens. They sent me a free replacement with no hassle with RA #s, return shipping, etc., (Great service). The new one works, but the lens threads are a little sharp. I have many step-up rings, (some of them are Bower) & I've never had this problem before. Just the 52-55mm. Bower rings."
4,Pleased,I am pleased with the bed. It's a very nice color. Going to stain it when I move out. But it's lovely and tall and sturdy. I broke it in the other day to find that it makes minimal noise!! That was one of the main reasons for buying a wood bed. I hope this bed lasts better than the last one :/
3,Good enough,"The quality of the bed was fine. I was able to put it together by myself in about 30 minutes. However, I probably could have gotten something of similar quality from Ikea for less. It also took over a week just to be shipped out, but the transit time was only three days. Overall, it's fine for the price."
4,Nice bed,"Item was easy to assemble, except the king size comes with two support beams, and without a mallet and a wood shaver I would never have gotten it together. Still, instructions pretty good and to the point. It only took my thirty or so minutes. Looks great put together, and is very comfortable with my spring mattress. Will be even better once I get a headboard though."
5,"Great simple bed, very sturdy","This bed was easy to put together and is very sturdy, just as other reviewers have noted. I also have the drawers underneath and they slide very well. A great purchase!"
5,Great value product!!!,"Great product for the price - very sturdy and easy to assembly (15-30 min., even 1 person can assembly it easily)!!! Outstanding customer service (if you need help or replacement pieces)! Fast shipment. Very pleased with the purchase, plus it has a pleasant pine scent."
5,Incredible!,"Little Things, following Silvy's debut album Chances, is incredible. The tracks on Little Things are wonderful for dancing, relaxing, or putting your mind in a different world. Livin My Life is one of the best tracks. For the listener who is really in tune with the music, it provides a sense of serenity, hope, and a brighter future; plus it totally rocks to dance to. The video for Livin My Life is amazing as well! Anyone who enjoys techno, trance, eurodance, or all types of music, will love this album. Silvy's beautiful voice provides the listener with hours of relaxation and pleasure! A must have CD!"
1,so so,This is geared more toward little kids in the 4 to 5 range. Overly simplified for older kids who are looking for books about worms.
3,There's no freakin' brakes!!!!!,There's only room for one foot on the foot plate and there are no brakes. Again the spiderman plate on the front is way too big and you cannot hold onto the hand grips. You need tools to raise and lower the handle bars (instead of that neat little flip thing on other scooters). It's sturdy and my son loves it. He doesn't care about the flaws and defects. Buyer beware.
1,really slow service - Servicio lento,"Compre este scooter el dia 15 de Sep y tardo en llegar 15 dias, le escribi a esta persona y no me respondio, volvi a escribir dias despues y por fin me mando el tracking number.Para mi1.- Mala atencion2.- no comprare en esta tienda jamas!!!"
4,My toddler loves this!,"I have a rather small 2-yr old toddler (he still wears some 18-months clothes), and he absolutely loves this scooter! While he can't zoom around as quick as the bigger kids, he can keep it upright (since it has the 2 back wheels) and he uses his foot to kick around a little at a time. He hasn't had it very long, but it seems to be very durable, too. He loves the watch as well, though it's way too big for him... it has Spidey on it and that's all that matters to him!"
3,depends on what you're looking for,"This is a good challenging workout, but the music leaves something to be desired -- it's redundant and unoriginal. Shaun T is funny and likeable, but his jokes and high energy presentation get a little stale after doing the workouts for the first couple of times. I purchased this dvd a couple of months ago and no longer do it for those reasons. I am more into kundalini yoga -- so it probably just wasn't a good fit for me."
1,Hip Hop Abs Review,"I have done this Dvd once. It was awful. I will never purchase anotherexercise program form this instructor. I'll stick with Gunnar Peterson, Ellen Barrett, and Kathy Smith.This one was Horrible!!"
2,left me uneasy...,"This book was written in an ethnographic style, which left me feeling very uneasy with the American author's obvious cultural hang-ups and assumptions. (I notice that anthropology is not amongst her qualifications.) I would certainly not rely on this book as the last word on the subject of Voodoo, or the places she visits. However despite the ethnocentrism and egocentrism it was still quite an interesting book. It will be interesting to compare it with other books on African spirituality."
3,Puss n Boots,"The quality of the tape was great, the colors are beautiful but the story line is not as sunny as I thought it would be. I expected a little more I think that was delivered. The bright side was my order was on time and very reasonably priced"
5,The cat's got it all in high def blu ray,A first rate movie to own if you have high def/ blu ray. Definate re-watchability. (How does Puss keep his boots on when he's dancing.....)
5,Puss in Boots,What an enjoyable movie. Humorous. Good acting/voices. Very delightful. Good story. Entertaining for adults as well as children. Movie was in excellent condition from Amazon.
4,JUST FOR FUN WATCH PUSS & BOOTS,"YOU HAVE TO BE IN THE RIGHT MOOD FOR THIS LITTLE ROMP WITH PUSS AND BOOTS, BUT I FOUND IT DELIGHTFUL. IT DOES PUT A DEFINITE TWIST ON THE CHARACTERS OF HUMPTY DUMPTY, JACK AND JILL/JACK IN THE BEANSTOCK BUT ALL TO THE GOOD. EVEN THE ROMANTIC INTERLUDE FOR PUSS IS VERY GOOD. PUSS' VOICE IS TERRIFIC AND IT HAS A SPANISH SETTING, FITTING ANTONIO'S ACCENT. I LIKED IT, MY HUSBAND TOLERATED IT AND MY GRANDKIDS LOVED IT."
5,Just the name alone gets 5 STARS :),"I got this 3d blu ray combo pack, and of course a copy for the iPad came with it. Come on people, Anything with Puss in Boots is a winner! Loved the movie, and yes its worth every penny!!"
1,terrible movie,terrible movie: the worse movie ever made! What a waste of money and time to watch it. It was not even cute. Preview lies!
4,Brilliant!,"I enjoyed this film so much! I'd recommend it to anybody who enjoys a good plot, with great characters, funny laughs and fantastic visuals! I would much rather watch this than a shrek film."
2,Boring Movie,"This movie looks like it's going to be a very funny story about a cat who happens to be so full of himself, well, it is not that good. The only funny parts are in the trailer. You have been warned."
2,Not wonderful,I was disappointed - they should have quit after the first Puss n Boots DVD. This is NOT a keeper.
3,Good Movie for Family,"Good entertainment for family - good animation. It's not the Puss 'n' Boots story that I grew up with, but it's entertaining."
1,puss in boots,I send it back. it doesn't work. It is not a good idea buy cheap not good product in third party.
4,delightful,"What a charming character Puss is! Soft Paws was not so much so, but good enough for one movie. Perhaps they will come up with a more likeable character that is a equally as charming as Puss if they create a character for Catherine Zeta-Jones. It was great for Puss to get his own movie. Now perhaps one where he goes across the country saving damsels in distress, while doing other deeds of whatevs."
2,Puss in Boots,"What age group was this made for? I enjoy watching animated films from time to time, and sharing with younger members of my family. This one doesn't cut it, so to speak. I felt the sword play wasn't appropriate for younger children, the story line was silly and contrived, and overall a waste.Some of the so called Fairy Tales, like Jack and the Bean Stalk, do contain violence, or are at least a bit scary. But to make a silly movie, and try to pull all sorts of stories together was a waste of talent.I'm sure some will like it - my advice is to stream it first, before buying to watch multiple times. I for one will probably never watch it again. Sorry I didn't take my own advice, and 'preview' it first."
2,Schlocky disappointment,"I really like Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek, but this film is a total disappointment. It can be amazing to see an actor doing all kinds of amazing action moves, but cartoon characters doing flips and spins and such is not at all impressive. I could only watch about 20 minutes of it before total boredom set in."
5,Positively Provocative!,"This author goes places others simply don't! Le Mons delivers an important and controversial message that he cleaverly weaves into a story revolving around a cast of characters who are simply addictive. How To Ruin The Perfect Child Sizzles, Seduces, and Satisfies!!!"
3,Over a three to four year period...,"A guy most of us never heard of (Wolfgang Haffner) produced and recorded some average smooth jazz with some musicians you may have heard of (Chuck Loeb, Kim Waters, Jeff Golub) and put enough selections together to release a cd. The title track Coconut Kiss opens satisfactory and Right On is almost,well ""right on"", but honestly Haffner could have dispensed with the breaks between tracks because they all for the most part sound the same. This is an example why session players remain session players...."
4,music lover,this album is retro bliss.I really like it alot. Reminds me of the cars. Its just plain fun.
5,Where have you been all my life?,"Woah. And I thought The Drums were awesome. I mean - I still love them, but it's a love now tinged with a splash of sadness that they are no longer Elkland. 'Golden' is, without exaggeration, a fun fabulous five-star album. Every track."
2,Filter adapter stuck to filter,"I have a 77 mm Hoya ND filter. I placed this adapter on my wishlist and received as gift. The first time I used it, I just practiced setting up a few shots working out settings. When I took it off my lens, the adapter was stuck to the filter. I cannot get it off and fear I will ruin my filter. While this is the first time I have used one of these, I did not over tighten it. Word for the wise - do a Google search on 'stuck filter adapters' before using this and buyer beware. None of the solutions has worked for me."
2,Disappointing,"Having been thrilled by some of Rilling's Bach, I had great hopes for this recording. But I'm disappointed. the choral singing is too detached and jerky to be enjoyable, with the exception of ""Lift Up Your Heads"" which is the best I've heard. The male singers aren't bad, but Quasthoff's English too often goes just a shade off color."
5,Well made and stylishly functional,I really enjoy using this teapot. Use a pot holder because the handle does transfer a bit of heat. The tea stays hot for more time than I need. The quality of the construction is very good and I enjoy the heft and feel of the Stainless Steel.
5,great dressing,"Another recommendation from my doctor (see PolyMem) that makes wound-dressing so much easier. You can shower with this product, but it still ""breathes"".I love the fact that amazon makes finding these products so much easier."
4,A positive review of the book's content.,"A little dry, but an important book. It shows that there was a cold war long before the Cold War, a war of subversion declared by the Soviet Union. It also shows (as if anybody ever had any doubts) that the Communist Party USA was no more than an appendage of the Soviet government. American communists used to insist they were just 'liberals in a hurry'. Where were they going in such a hurry? Now we know."
2,Reds in Wartime America,"I did not like this book. American and British citizens who spied for the Sovietsd are described as ""adventurous spirits"". The word The authors should be looking for is ""traitor""."
4,Better for younger grades,I read this when I was student teaching with 2nd graders they loved it so I thought I would do this with my 6th graders they didn't really enjoy it as much. They made fun of it a bit since there was no words. If you have a mature artistic group of kids they will enjoy no matter the age though.
4,The Bigger Picture,The friend who shared this book with me had received it from a family member who bequeathed it to her as she lay dying of cancer. It is a very beautiful and visual way of internalizing the concept that our lives and everything that happens to us and that we see around us is part of a bigger picture.
3,"Series is great, but dvds were in poor conditon","I totally love the hercules series, but the dvd series package i got were all scratched or something. Most of the episodes that were watched kept stopping or would freeze up jumping to a scene about 20 minutes later etc. I finally was able to fix all of them thanks to Hastings. But i'm not happy with this overall transaction."
5,Realy Fun!,This show is realy fun. While the special effects are poor in many areas but its the spirit of the show that makes it worth watching. Keep in mind that this was never supposed to be historicaly accurate or taken very seriously. That is part of the charm of Hercules. Hopefully people will still be watching decades from now.
1,damaged discs,I ordered the first 6 seasons of hercules as a b-day gift for my daughter. Two of the seasons wont even load and the other seasons constantly skip. These came in Oct and I am still trying to get a refund or replacement and my daughter still has not been able to enjoy her gift.
3,Some good ideas - but...,"Perhaps I was too anxious to improve my photography skills. I bought two of Nick Kelsh's books - this one and photographing family. Both have many similarities. Easy to read, some greats ideas, but skimpy on details. As a first photography book, it has value. I found the Family book more useful."
4,Will help you take amazing photos of more than just babies..,"I flipped through this book at a store and was so amazed. Full-color, great presentation of deceptively simple ideas. His premise is this - - Amatuers take medicore photos because they:**Don't shoot enough film. (Take more pictures!)**Don't get close-enough to the subject (use your zoom! get close!)**Use flash (turn your flash off!)This is a great, easy book with real tips and you will amaze yourself at how much you improve your photos after reading this.The only shortfall, as I recall, is that he doesn't include tips on photo-finishing. A good picture is dimished with a bad print. Some advice on how to deal with your photo lab, how to find a good one, and how to request different types of borders and papers would be excellent."
5,Strawberry Shortcake: Let's Dance,I ordered this cd for my 3 yr old granddaughter for Christmas. She loves to sing and dance. She loves it!
1,BORING !,"I read this book for preparation to enter City College of San Francisco's Math 840-Elementary Algebra Class. It took me like 3 months to get through this and it didn't help me out at all. On top of that it was so boring I was afraid I might die of boredom at times. This book is of no help at all for understanding the principles of mathematics. If this guy was my teacher, I'd give him a lousy evaluation."
3,Overpowering,"I love free jazz, I ought to like this CD more than I do, but something puts me off--maybe Ware's incredibly harsh timbre, maybe the production which puts all four instruments IN YOUR FACE. Ware's ideas and skill are evident, but once you get past the opening track it's difficult listening."
1,WHAT THE HECK IS THIS? ANOTHER GH ALBUM!!!,"Ozzy did this back in '97 with fewer songs on it plus an unreleased track ""Back On Earth,"" which was cool, but why repeat a greatest hits compilation just six years later with only one new album under his belt since the last greatest hits album?! The more actions I see Ozzy make with his music career, the more I'm convinced our rock 'n' roll God has truly fried his brain!! And if his wife is to blame for it, well then she's just plain stupid, I never liked her anyway. On top of all of this, even the smallest Ozzy fan has all of these songs anyway on other albums, there is no doubt of that, so why bother with this? It's dumb! Do not buy this, it doesn't even have any unreleased bonus tracks on it! I also saw on the billboard charts that this album debuted at number eighty-something, if that doesn't prove the point I'm trying to make here, I don't know what will! This album is a waste of Ozzy's time and fans money!"
4,Good Intro to Ozzy's music but missing good songs.,Its missing songs such as steal away the night blood bath in paradice and revelation mother earth.This is my first Ozzy album but ive heard his other songs.And for those hoo dont agree ozzy has a great voice and a great guitar player and bass drummer and keyboardist.
1,Wheres the sin?,How can this be the essential ozzy when no song off of the ultimate sin are on it. The ultimate sin was the last great album that ozzy put out. Sure he has come out with good songs but the ultimate sin was the last album by ozzy where every single song is a gem. I dont know if there was some sort of fight over royalties which kept ozzy from puting these tunes on this greatest hits package but it was a mistake. Save your money. Dont buy this cd. Instead go out and by The Ultimate sin. You will enjoy it much better. There are more greatest hits on the ultimate sin than on this whole greatest hits 2 cd package combined.
3,AVERAGE BEST OFF!,"Hi all first of all, why in the blazes no songs from the ""ULTIMATE SIN"", or""SPEAK OF THE DEVIL"" are here in this so called best of, well i agree essential is a ok album, but there's something kindda suspicious about that 1986',Ultimate.S. releasein all comps i've seen only one song is cited ""shot n the dark!"" the weakest of the u.s album , but here none are represented and guess what????? ...the album is sooooo hard to find along with the 'speak of the....."" anyway ,the weakest songs of ""Bark"" also are here(seems to me that ozz, didn't get along so well with Jake!?)or maybe he hated everything that had to do with that glam era . well like i said good ,but not good enough /thanx!"
4,"Power Metal with a goth keyboard tinge ?, plus a lack of horse hoof beats and 1000 mph songs","In short, for some reason this band makes me think of what Deep Purple could have sounded like today, and with more of a ""gothic"" keyboard sound, more melodic choruses, and vocalist. It is power metal, but it tends to lack the horse hoof beats and 1000 mph songs. While the album is solid/without fillers, I only gave it 4 stars because there isn't really one song that reaches out and grabs me, of course that is just me."
1,don't bother,"This book was picked for my book club after one of our misguided members reccomended it. All 8 women readers were repulsed, the 3 men found it fantasy based, and the homosexual male thought it was fantastic. Ladies, don't take relationship advice from a single, 36 year old man who'd never been married (according to his bio) and probably spends way too much time on the internet. Save your $7! you're intelligent..go figure it out for yourself!"
1,Misleading and dangerous,"I am a nurse practitioner who contracted Hepatitis C from an accidental needle stick injury. In reading the opening chapters, there were many mistaken facts and flat-out incorrect advice. For example, the author talks about limiting caffeine when recent studies have proven that coffee is very helpful in reducing liver inflammation. Additionally, she talks about ""weaning"" off red meats, when actually a vegeterian diet is much more beneficial. The cookbook includes many recipes for chicken and fat laden ingredients such as cheeses, cream, etc. This author is not well informed and the cookbook has limited usage. Any informed person with Hep C will immediately recognize how poorly this author researched her topic. She should have included a nutritionist and hepatologist."
3,Hepatitis C Cookbook,It will help me some what. My boyfriend has galstones and pancreatitis along with cirrosis of the liver so I was hoping for more recipes without onions or mushrooms.
4,best game ever,I love this game its a challege at first with the punching keys for the square and making a combo but you can tell its old school ! XD
4,"Great Watch, Very dependable","I own 3 of these watches(different colors) The only complaint i have with this watch is that the timer reset does not reset on the 12:00. it is about 2 seconds off , so if you are trying to time something accurte it is to hard to keep track of it. otherwise you will enjoy this watch.jtabor."
3,"I love it, it's the best thing I got for Christmas!","I had a Sony 1 MP camera before I was given this one, and I'll tell you 5 MP is a big diffrence! The camera has all kinds of settings, but they aren't realy good, the indoor settings have a slow shutter speed so the pictures almost always come out blured or they don't work with the flash. If you want to take a good indoor picture you need a tripod, and your subject must not move for several seconds. I learned the best setting is M, it has a fairly quick shutter speed, and you can turn the flash on, off, or there is a good red-eye reduction setting."
1,Dead CCD,"I bought this camera 1 year and 10 months ago. Used only occasionally, never took it out in the rain or snow. The CCD just died the day after Christmas ... All the pictures I take come out completely black. Everything else seems to work (the lense, flash, LCD...)After a bit of googling it appears that many people are experiencing the same problem..."
2,Nikon Coolpix 5400 bites the dust after only 2 years,"Get this: the eyehole that holds one of the strap ends broke free, and the tiny (internally mounted!) screws that held it in place jiggled their way to the lens mechanism and turned the camera into a paperweight. This was the second instance of fragility. Right after the warrentee expired, the USB port stopped working, so for two years I had to upload via a cardreader.Save your money."
2,Low Light Focus?,"I tried and tried to get this camera to focus in low light situations in full auto mode and it just would not. Manually focusing is a pain and without some kind of light to assist with low light focusing, I can not recommend this camera and will be returning it."
3,Getting old - look elsewhere,"The Coolpix 5400 is a model that's nearly two years old and, in digital photograpy terms, it's already a dinosaur. It takes good-quality pictures, better than most tiny point-and-shoots, but compared to Nikon's newer advanced compact digital cameras (8400, 8700, 8800, etc.) and the latest G-series from Canon, it's a very lackluster performer. I also have issues with the very small (1.5"") LCD screen. The sensor on this camera is small, resulting in picture quality that cannot be compared to cameras with larger sensors.Yes, this is cheap after the $200 rebate, but it's a camera that wasn't great when it was new and is definitely way out-of-date by now, and its picture quality just doesn't do justice to the Nikon brandname."
1,If NO STARS were available - that's what NIKON gets,DITTO -- Dead Nikon 5400 after less than one year and very good care on my part - returned to Nikon - held my camera hostage wanting $162.50 to repair !!!! Let me say that again - wanted $162.50 to repair. Wow!!! - are they smoking crack at Nikon? - THE LAST NIKON product I ever buy - forget the camera. The company (NIKON) has lost touch with reality and doesn't understand how to keep customers - - GO BUY A CANON and pass it on . .. . next batter up.
5,Office Table,"Great table,perfect size and shape, good price and quick shipping.Easy to assemble and very strong and well built."
1,Unreliable,"Worked really well for about 2 months and then began to go off sporadically. Eventually had to disconnect. Battery lasted about 4 months and was very difficult to change (jeweller's screwdriver) - eventually despite seals being in place - water got in and destroyed system. When it worked - was great, but that was only 30% of time. Now looking for more reliable replacement. Whoever designed it had no familiarity with practical use."
2,Not good for the shelf exam!,"I bought this book to study for the Introduction to Physical Diagnosis shelf exam, which I took two weeks ago. It did not help at all for the exam. The scope of the questions in this book were way off from the questions on the shelf, and the questions in this book were also harder than the questions on the shelf. Maybe this book would help for other exams, such as the medicine shelf, but it is NOT good for the physical diagnosis shelf!!"
2,Nothing special,"If you're an underwire-wearing gal like me, are looking for a change and thought when you saw this bra: ""Ooo, a 'magic ring wire-free bra'! This should be great."" Don't waste your money. Virtually no support for fuller bosom. Perhaps the sizing on this bra is very different from others. The sellers were good, but the product is lousy. Be loyal to your favorite brands. They won't steer you wrong."
1,same as tv episodes,"If you love Ninjago and don't mind paying for the episodes that have already aired on tv by all means buy this dvd. Otherwise, don't waste your money. I was expecting it to have more that what's already been on the Cartoon Network. I bought two as gifts and will be returning both."
5,Grandson LOVES Ninjago!,"Happy to find this available online, and my grandson was super excited to find this under the Christmas tree. Little boys LOVE Ninjago!"
5,Unforgettable,"I read this book as a child about 45 years ago. I loved it and never forgot it, although its title transformed in my child's brain to ""way beyond Z"". It inspired me, fed my imagination and made me feel like a child with special sight. Unlike adults, I KNEW the alphabet beyond Z!! Now that I have located this title again, I will give it to every child I know! Thank you, Dr. Seuss!"
2,Save your money,"The book is somewhat well written, but it is more of a history and it has very limted info on how to rig or set up a lighting show, has really no info on what to buy or what to get for a light show, has more info on how the writer played a part of the development of some products, I'd say that this is a waste of money, if one is looking for info on setting up a light show"
2,Beautiful but.....,"I bought this faucet at a local home improvements store for much more than it is listed here. I do love the high arc of the faucet and the overall look. However, in the three years that I've owned it I've had to have the sprayer replaced three times and am getting ready to do it again!!! For such a nice faucet set-up the sprayer is the cheapest thing I've ever come across. The chrome finish peels off of the plastic sprayer head and everything turns green. I've also had such trouble with each sprayer head trigger sticking and the one I have now keeps leaking water back down the hose all over the cabinet under my sink! Although the company replaces it every time with no questions asked, I wish they would ask or at least listen!! Maybe this is a low price for some, but it was a bit of a luxury item for our household and I'm extremely disappointed."
2,Sprayer sticks,"I too have had to replace the sprayer 3 times. The company did send me a replacement each time, but it is getting a little ridiculous. The sprayer sticks in the on position and if you are not careful to unstick it before turning off the water, whomever uses it next will get sprayed. This is especially embarrassing when guests are the ones to use it next!"
2,Very disappointed!,"We recently built a new home and installed this faucet. I was disappointed from the start. It's a good thing I have granite all around the sink because it splashes the water so much that everything around the faucet gets wet. Now that the faucet is over a year old, the sprayer has stopped working. A plumber tells me the diverter has failed. My next step is to see how well Price Pfister stands behind their product."
5,I Have Never Seen A DVD As Beautiful As This.,This Movie is filmed on breathtaking 70mm film. It is an amazing IMAX quality film. A new definition in filmmaking brings the scriptures to breathtaking light in this extraordinary series. Beautiful footage of nature combined with contemporary Christian music and readings from the Old and New Testament create a visual masterpiece for the teachings of the 5th commandment.
3,Looks good. Lasting? I don't know...,"It sure makes the front look good, but it's plastic and it's exposed in an area that gets a lot of punishment. So, if you like pretty you got it, if you want durable... I don't know."
4,MAE DAY,"This is the film in which 39 year - old Broadway star Mae West made her debut in motion pictures; like co-star George Raft once said ""She stole everything but the cameras"". Alison Skipworth is hilarious as Mabel Jellyman and when she is taking nips with Mae, she asks ""Maudie, what do you think I should do with my inhibitions?"" to which Mae replies ""Well, honey, I've got an old trunk over here""! When Mae asks Mabel to get into her ""racket"" which is one of ""the best payin' around"" (Maudie has her own chain of beauty parlours called ""Institute de Beaut"") Mabel mistakenly thinks Maudie's talking prostitution and answers ""Well, dontcha think I'm just a little old""? Not a great movie by any means, it comes alive only when Mae appears on screen. ""Night after Night"" is the name of the speakeasy in which the movie takes place."
5,If you could only read one book this would be it.,"This books is the most uplifting of anything I've read. Once you get through the somewhat strange language and hear the message behind the words, you'll find yourself smiling from the heart. On a side note.... I don't think the editorial review about it being a step by step guide to getting out of addictive relationships is correct at all. This book as nothing distinctly to do with that. Does anyone know how to tell amazon about this?"
3,"Great Concept, Sloppy Execution","Tim Underwood has made a valiant attempt at a great idea. There is much to be gained here for a Christian golfer who wants his golf to glorify God. That should be the goal. However, the book has sloppy editing and format problems. Some of the theology is inaccurate (Ex: calling ""The fruits of the Spirit"" ""spirits"", and refering to the time Jesus was in prison [?]). I don't want to be too tough. I appreciate Tim Underwood's effort, and his heart. I would NOT discourage a Christian golfer from buying a copy."
4,The beginnings of civilization.,"I am neither an ancient history buff nor a historian, but began to explore the Sumerians only after my curiousity about the beginnings of civilization enabled me to discover this amazing culture. Here were the beginnings of epic literature. myth and religion, writing and an advancedculture almost three millenia before the birth of Christ! Samuel Noah Kramer is a specialist and authority in this field, and has produced an interesting, factually correct and fascinating book. If you're bored with the 21st century, give this one a try!"
2,"Dido Live, but not feeling well...","I'm sorry, but it sounds like she has a cold throughout this entire concert. She does not sustain the notes, her voice cracks, and her range seems truncated. I realize the monetary ramifications would have been tremendous, but either the concert should have been postponed or at least the memorializing of the concert on DVD should have waited. I notice that no one else seems to have mentioned this, but I have listened to this DVD repeatedly, and every time it makes me wince. Just one man's opinion, but buy her audio CD's, and hopefully someone will produce another DVD soon..."
4,No change in the art world,A compelling and interesting insight into the NYC art world---where little has changed over the most recent decades!
5,Great Composition of One of The Best Mexican Ranchera Singers,"This CD is a collection of great romantic Mexican songs performed by Pedro Fernandez, one of the best Mexican ranchera singers.This CD has the same songs than ""Las 32 Mas Grandes de Pedro Fernandez"" CD even the song sequence is almost identical. So, check for the best deal."
5,The Queen of Love,"I have been listening to Meshell Ndegeocello for a long time and I must say that there is no one who can do a love song like Meshell. I could listen to her sing about love all day. Don't get me wrong, I also love to her sing/speak about racism, sexism, homophobia, religious hipocracy, sense of self, etc. Anyone can write a song, but Meshell has a way of taking a love song to a whole new level. She can make you feel whatever she is feeling. ""Love Song #1"" is magic. I can't get enough of that one. Words can't express the beauty and the power this song has...one of my all time favorites from her.""Andromeda and the Milky Way"" is amazing, along with ""Good Intentions"", and ""Thankful"". The whole album is fantastic.This album represents what we all need more of in our lives...love, inner peace, understanding, and more love."
5,Her best yet,"An instant classic, Meshell shines throughout this set in every way, beautiful vocals, lyrics and particularly gorgeous musical arrangements. The album shows rare consistency throughout, in fact I wanted to copy just a couple of songs onto a personal mix CD but I couldn't figure out which 2 to choose because they are all so awesome and they make so much sense together. The album took me back to Prince in his hey-day and Marvin Gaye and Sade and..., the list goes on, just great musical references throughout. Her musicianship continues to evolve and to me it makes her the most potent and creative female soul/funk artist around. Go on with yo' bad self Meshell!!"
4,Nice Groove Here!,"Well, this is NOT Plantation Lullabies, but I enjoy listening to it just the same. A nice groove. Andromeda and the Milky Way, Love Song 1, 2, 3 and Come Smoke My Herb are standouts, to me. If you can't get lucky when you put this on, you probably need to go smoke some herb."
2,still trying to hard,"While off the Bat I respect the Musical Talent of Meshall'Ndegeocello She is a very solid Bass Player&has a solid Groove Presence as time goes by She is sounding flater&flater to me.She never could Sing&the Writing is still way over the top to me.She still is pretty average as a Songwriter over time.I still feel that She would be better Producing someone else or writing on someone else.""Come Smoke my Herb"" is a Cool Cut but overall I ain't feeling this set much."
5,Great For Me!,"I loved this book. I found it easy to read and never condescending. Many other books that I have read do tend to talk down to you and The Child Whisperer talks to you like you are the parent, so you already know most of what's best."
5,Great tool for working with children,"Working with over 50 children every day can be quite stressful for a person who doesn't have a great deal of experiece with children. Reading ""The Child Whisperer"" provided me with the tools and ability to better deal with children on a daily basis. Being able to better control my emotions has led to better relationships with the children I work with. I highly suggest ""The Child Whisperer"" to all parents and teachers."
5,Worked just right,Had some 62 mm filters from my old Olympus SLR camera lenses and didn't want to waste them so this was a good solution for most applications. Works fine.
4,An important book,"I worked on the Natchez Trace for two years and I had a hard time finding any scholarly information until I discovered this book. It was a godsend. It was one of the few things around that actually had footnotes! The more popular ""Devil's Backbone"" is awful-a good story, but no sources noted, making it impossible to follow up on what was factual and what wasn't. This book is well laid out; rather than chronologically, it was thematic, which worked well for me as a tour guide. Davis also did a great job debunking some myths, such as the number of people murdered by outlaws on the Trace. If you read any ""stories"" about the Trace, do yourself a favor and read this as well, for a little perspective."
1,Not for everyone,"What a great title! A guys guide... Thought it would be perfect gift for my neice's husband, who just learned that he's going to be a dad.Luckily, I read through the first few pages before I gave it to him. I as far as recommendations of living in sin, and vibrator parties, and knew it would be totally inappropriate for my Born-again christian newphew and niece."
3,Really not a good movie,"I really enjoy the fantasy genre, both in literature, games and movies. This movie, however, hardly justifies what theaters would charge to see it. I'm not going to beat a dead horse, but wait for this one to show up on TV. There won't be anything to cut out, and you'll have some much-needed commercial time to get away for a couple minutes.In fact, this movie should probably have gone straight-to-SciFi, so Joel McHale could use it for material on The Soup.I gave it three stars because though it was no LoTR epic, it wasn't the complete trash others have described it as. You just have to set your expectations before watching it. Then manage your expectations and resist the temptation to fast forward just to get through it faster.If you subscribe to a movie rental service and are looking for something to watch before another good movie is released, and you're even mildly into this genre, go for it. I'll pass the afternoon just fine."
2,Forget the game,"I found Dungeon Seige to be a very enjoyable game. Now comes a movie that says it is based on the game. No fear. I love the Resident Evil films. Here's another dramatization of a good game. Let's go.It also has a good cast. What could go wrong. Answer: EVERYTHINGThis has absolutely no similarity with the game except there is a town named EB. This is a travesty and they should have been sued by the game makers. There's nothing wrong with the beginning of the film, but after that everything is further and further downhill and it's too bad. This cast could have done well with a good story and script. You even have have Burt Reynolds as the King before his whole face looked like a plastic halloween mask.So much to work with and nothing done. If you do not see this film in your entire life you have not only missed nothing but perhaps you can still respect the actors."
1,"""This movie is so unbelievably bad that I have to break it down into parts for this review. ""","It's more entertaining then a blank screen.Seemed interesting at start with the special effects. You lost me at ""lizard"" people in 1970s costumes.Excessively cliche.Good story though. Good cast. Cool ideas. I really wanted to like this money and that i was awesome in the first few minutes.Shame on the producer. He had good talent (cast), idea, money... wtf?"
4,A must for any DnD fan,"I was surprised, and my expectations exceeded upon watching this. Its certainly not the same level as The Lord of the Rings series, but huge steps about the dungeons and dragons movies. Mostly I rented it because I'm a Jason Statham fan (since Snatch). I will be adding this to my colletion.The story was very reasonable - old dying king, crappy heirs to the throne, one of whom is trying to usurpe the throne for himself, a strong female character who actually knows how to fight (and when to say no), a nice supporting role for Ron Pearlman.I recommend this to any fantasy/action fan"
5,In The Name of The King; A Dungeon Siege Tale,Great movie and great acting . I tend to like these types of story lines (medeviel) for the mystery part of them and the time period . The actor Jason Statham has become a favorite actor of mine.
4,Fun and action,"I do not understand why people want to intellectualize this movie ! or to compare it with classics like Lord of the Rings.Sit back and enjoy the action, the excellent cinematography, and the ( yes) humor. ....good guys, bad guys (Liotta is excellent), Trolls and sumptuous tree girls."
2,I'm sure it could have been worse...,"SO, I didn't actually get a chance to see this whole movie...A couple of my buddies and I were bored, so we decided to check this out in theaters (first mistake) and I snuck in a few beers, but after having finished drinking them, my buddies and I looked at each other and, without need for words, simultaneously got up and walked out. It was probably right around the 45-minute mark, but I couldn't stand to see the baddies from Power Rangers revived to fight a bad LOTR knockoff battle with Statham. Take my review for what it is...the movie failed the 30-minute test and from reading the rest of these reviews, I am glad that 45 minutes is all that I wasted on it."
1,Horrible,This is a low budget B movie. It consisted of stupid looking alien bad guys and a very poor plot. Two friends of mine borrowed it and could only watch about a third of it.
4,"A ""CLASSICAL "" MOMENT WITH THE KING OF REGGAE.","BOB MARLEY,the most influential phenomenal reggae performer and his band(the wailers) can highly be appreciated in this D.V.D.21 songs (live) make it a collectible item.This is a great show-No question about it.The man himself is nothing short but a charismatic genuis.The public is incredible and lucky for this royal treatment.The feeling is that there may be something greater in the vault but this one here is still a great job!The documentary extra is pretty interesting and as some of us knows it,'Rastafarism'(the philosophy behind reggae music) was mostly perceived by fans worldwide as a ""get up and stand up for your rights"" reminder than a ""follow me"" to a spiritual salvation.And we will certainly all agree on one thing for sure:-one love/people get ready-:that's the legacy of B.M.W.(Bob Marley and the Wailers).Enjoy a legend live...Buy it..."
4,Eager to read!,"I haven't read this one yet, but the service was great, the book is in perfect condition and I'm anxious to spend time with one of Jodi's books again."
3,Romance novel type of mystery,"I love mysteries...but not romance novels. I also enjoy Amish culture. I thought this novel might be a nice blend. It was OK but seemed to drag on without enough substance. The trial was just everything you were already told...all over again...I skimmed it. More a love story than mystery but it did keep me wanting to know the end...which I skipped to after some boredom along the way. Point of note: It would be nice if personal ""reviewers"" would not disclose the entire contents of the books. Some people would like to find the details out on their own. Overall views are good...plot details are not. The literary reviews in the beginning do enough of the job to ""hint"" whether you'd like to read it or not...no need to continue to divulge more plot by subsequent readers!"
4,Bad details,"Although this book kept me reading, the details that were supposed to help the story along were poor. Apperently the medical stuff was researched, but i wonder...."
3,Long,"This book was too long for the plot, it dragged on. The ending was a surprise, but not satisfying for how long it was."
4,Plain Truth,As always Jodi Picoult delivers. The plot was very good and the characters were so interesting. I once visited an Amish community and was so enthralled by their way of life. This book gives a first row seat into that lifestyle. I definitely recommend!
4,Plain good,The characters are developed perfectly. You fall in love. Feel the hurt they feel. Definitely a good read. I would recommend it.
2,Plain Bad,"This was my first time reading a Jodi Picoult book and I really don't think I will attempt another one. The Plain Truth was painfully long, boring and repetitive. Every character was annoying and unbelievable - especially Ellie and Katie ( the main two). I kept waiting for a great twist with the ghost of Hannah but it never came. Just some added supernatural of no revelance thrown in. The beginning is the only part of the book I found interesting....It went downhill ( extremely slowly) after that."
2,Disappointing,"This was the first book by Jodi Picoult I've read. I'm trying to figure out what had led me to believe she was a skilled writer. This book illustrates that she can tell a story, but her prose is often clunky, her dialog hackneyed, and her characterizations thin. I enjoyed the glimpses into Amish life, particularly through Katie and Samuel. Ellie's story, on the other hand, read like a Lifetime movie. I had no sense of an actual inner life, and her outer life was a mass of cliches. Don't get me started on the interminable, abysmally written courtroom scenes.Others have commented on the ""surprise"" ending. I felt it was an unearned conclusion and truly unconvincing. Methinks Ms. Picoult considers herself deeper and more clever than she actually is."
2,Truth? or Consequences,"Not my favorite. About twice as long as it needed to be to say the same thing and I guessed how the baby got moved without waiting for the last page. It was definitely a situation that was hard to imagine, can't see much of that happening in real life."
4,Pretty good read,"I've never read a book by Picoult before and I thought this was a quick, entertaining read. However, I had things figured out early on and was disappointed in the fact that despite supposedly being a high-profiled, cutthroat attorney, Ellie Hathaway never initiated her own investigation into the baby's murder and was on the defensive, rather than the offensive, with the case. I think Picoult could've done a more believable job building the attorney part of Ellie's character. The courtroom scenes were okay ... I skimmed over the prosecution's part because it was hashed over stuff.She did a wonderful job building her characters and their interpersonal relationships, though."
4,Addictively Readable,"Jodi Picoult has created a well written and addictive book centering on the death of an infant in Amish country. The title of the book is a play on words involving what we see as the plain truth and what the Amish (Plain) people see as the truth. A fascinating look into the life of the Amish people, it is also a finely tuned psychological drama and a mystery too. We are drawn into the life of Katie, the young girl accused of murdering her newborn child, and Ellie, the big city lawyer who chooses to defend her. I stayed up all night to read the last third of the book, as I could not put it down. This is my second book by Ms. Picoult, and I am looking forward to making my way through all her novels."
4,This was a good read,I really enjoyed this book. It shows how innocent the way of the Amish is. The ending was great. I would recommend this to anyone.
5,20 Meloodies Pour Rever,We are enjoying the beautiful and relaxing sound of Morisod.thank also for your help to download his Vol. 2 purchase separately.
1,Never held air,"The first night I tried to sleep on this air mattress, I was on the ground by the end of the night. Threw it away after trying it again. It came with a patch kit, but how the heck are you suppose to find a small leak?"
5,Great airbed,"We bought this airbed to use in our camper. Just got back from vacation, slept on it for six nights and never had to add air!Our combined wieght is a little over 400 pounds!!!"
1,Not Happy,I purchase this bed and my experience was not very good. I woke up every morning on the floor. I have used air mattress before and know how they work. I had to buy another bed and will never purchase another product from this company.
4,Our company has no complaints,"We got this air mattress for an additional sleeping space over the holidays. Everyone who slept on it said it was really comfortable. There is still the same amount of air in it as when I inflated it. I will give it 4 stars instead of 5 since I haven't slept on it myself.Update: A year later, we somehow punctured the mattress when filling it with the air compressor in the garage. I used a super glue type product called Quick-Grip made by Beacon...found at Wal-Mart...and it completely covered and sealed the puncture and holds air just as it did when it was new. Thought this info could help others."
2,Not as good as I expected,Slides on chair so hard to sit on. Foam is good and last long though and comfortable.
4,Perfect Fit & Comfort,"I bought this air mattress to replace the damaged one in our pull-out sofa bed. This means that it is left permanently inflated and used on a daily basis. (Sign of the times.) The mattress fit perfectly, is wonderfully comfortable and the price and speed of delivery were both top notch. Had it been purchased for its no doubt proper intent, which is occasional use, I would have given it a 5."
2,Thoroughly disappointing...,"I was really excited at the thought of reading this book, I'd been looking for it for a couple of years before I finally snagged a copy. The premise would lead one to think it would be a hilarious book...I was greatly disappointed.There are too many characters (what the hell was the point of Irene?), the sub-plots are confusing and have little or nothing to do with the main story itself. And worst of all, it's just not funny. Fortunately I only paid (very little) for it, I wouldn't pay much more than that."
1,Not what I expected,"This book is heavily religious. I would not have bought it if I knew there would be bible verses on each page. If you are a religious person, this is the book for you. If not, don't bother. We did not fill out any pages, and donated it to the church rummage sale."
3,Not the best I've ever seen.,"I recently purchased this dvd due to my love of classic television. The quality left much to be desired,but this is often the case with public domain video. One has to accept this sometimes to see the old shows however. I am surprised a TV Guide presents offering was of such poor quality though. I have found their releases to be more than acceptable as a rule. The packaging says Digitally Remastered/Enhanced Sound,but if this is true the copies they remastered and enhanced must have been nearly unwatchable if this release is an improvement.Disc one contains.The adventures of Ellery Queen (11/8/1951)The adventures of Sherlock Holmes (10/25/1954)Dick Tracy (1952)Dragnet (11/06/1952)Gangbusters (1952)Man with a camera (12/12/1958)Disc TwoThe Lone Wolf (1954)Mr&Mrs.North; (12/05/1952)Mr District Attorney (1954)Peter Gunn (01/19/1959)Philip Marlowe (03/08/1960)Richard Diamond (07/29/1957)"
3,Not my favorite,"The size of the ball hopper is good, however falls over easily and the top pops open and sends all the balls flying. I dont recommend this one..."
1,You Failed !!,"Amazon, you failed to deliver this product, and you advised me just days beforeChristmas..............shame on you. I was very disappointed and surprised atAmazon."
2,It Could Be Better,"My grandchildren are such big fans of Avatar they haven't noticed the 10 year old game design technology used to create this program. Although published in 2006 the game reminds me of Atari's Missle Command and other simple games created 10-15 years ago, just more eye appealing. Low budget game design is a thing of the past and doomed to financial failure. I'm glad it only cost $10 because that's all it's worth.So here's the challenge: THQ, give it up! Give the Avatar game software franchise to a company that will put the time and effort into creating a great game. Imagine an Avatar: The Last Air Bender by Electronic Arts with the game quality and fun of any of the Lord of the Rings series. Then imagine Avatar fans williness to pay $50 for a game worthy of our hard earned cash."
5,a well-conceived publication that is any coach's dream,"I have seldom seen anyone as detailed, as thorough, or as organized as Bill Walsh. This book should be a measuring stick for every coach, administrator, general manager, owner, or businessman. Walsh provides readers with virtually every situation a coach could experience. It is the most complete football book I have ever seen. The Genius leaves nothing out."
4,Good balance?,Bom Balanco is a group based out of Salvador Bahia Brazil. Their style can best be described as Axe but it also has a pagode feel to it. This band has a nice party sound to them and I imagine that they are very popular at carnaval. However one of my favorites on this cd is a slower song called Daniela.
4,Okay,I took two tablets and I feel a little different. After taking the full regimen I will know if everything isworking.Thank you very much.
3,This album is both good and bad...,"For anyone who has never heard CC's earlier cds, this album would most likely be very enjoyable. But for those of us who have heard their earlier work would admit that 'Back Home' is a little weak. I think that it's good to hear them refer to God more in their songwriting, (I guess that would show a sign of spiritual growth for them) but at the same time, the lack of Aaron Tate and Derek Webb's songwriting is quite evident. Derek Webb's presence is hardly made known on this cd which is a shame. I highly admired his intensely honest songs.But the good thing is that this is probably one of the best displays of Danille Young's beautiful voice. More specifically in 'The High Countries'.Musically, I think that they wanted to get back to their acoustic roots which they kind of abandoned in 'Long Line of Leavers'. All in all this is a good album in of itself."
5,It's good to go home again.,"It's amazing how much a band can change. Caedmon's has grown so much since ""My Calm/Your Storm,"" in talent, style, and membership. But even though this album is totally new and different, the last ten years of Caedom's are still there.Listening to ""Back Home"" made me feel as if this album was some what of a tribute to the past while preparing us for the new direction the band is bound to take in the next ten years. Personally, I found this album to be a very bittersweet experience. I was sad to see Derek Webb making his exit bows, but at the same time it was exciting to see the very talented Josh Moore begin to come into his own. Like I said, bittersweet, but entirely satisfying. Fellow coffee drinkers should know exactly what I mean."
1,UFO Lamp.,"Think twice before buying this lamp! Looks better on the picture. Way to overpriced, bright light coming from the sides of the lamp. End up sending back and getting much better lamp at Zgallery."
5,Great film,"It's a great film with a perfect end. I saw it at Festival de Sitges where it won varios prices, and I fall in love with Chained."
4,"Left my jaw on the floor, in a very good way","Very well acted, incredibly interesting concept, and one of the most disturbing endings I have ever seen, ""Chained"" left me reeling from beginning to pulse pounding end. Everything about this movie was carefully crafted, and it made methink about it even after the credits had finished rolling. A truly remarkable film, which makes no qualms in expecting intelligence from its audience. Amazing in every respect."
3,Its an ok movie.,Its mostly about the relationship between the killer and the young boy he kidnaps. I was more interested in the murders. But most of the murders take place OFF screen.
4,You will not find this review helpful,"The best things about this film are Jennifer Lynch, Vincent D'Onofrio, Saskatchewan-Canada, the ending, and of course the mind of Damian O'Donnell."
4,Bad Detective,"Here we see Bobby Goren inhabited by his evil twin.A bizarre,but compelling movie, featuring a strange twistat the end. There is violence and blood, but it is not gratuitous."
2,a potentially good movie ruined by atwist ending,"Most of the movie was good. Others complained about the gore, but I dealt with it. I was interested and curious to see how the story would develop, and it was going along well until the very ending, warning, spoiler, where the serial killer was revealed to be the uncle of the boy he kidnapped, and the boy's father hired him to get rid of his wife and son.... Seriously. Once that was revealed, the movie pretty much lost all meaning. I was no longer able to take it seriously."
3,Really needs an errata sheet,"Although readable and well organized, there are lots of careless errors. I am surprised that neither the publisher nor the author maintains an online errata sheet for this book. Given a well-maintained errata sheet, I would prefer this book to the Michael Meyers book. But since there is no errata sheet, I would have to recommend the Michael Meyers book."
4,"Frederica is my favorite singer, and this is my favorite.","Rich sensuous heartfealt songs by my favorite alto for many years, now on CD."
3,"Good performance, but not the best","Jamiroquai is a very good group. Nice music and Jay K is a powerful singer, but this show is not the best I've seen. One cannot avoid to compare with other DVD like Live in Verona. Good, but not my preferred one"
3,just because l like jamiroquai,"l like jamiroquai, but the in my sony hometheater system 5.1, it doesn't work ok, the show is great, but the sound is just ok.l have another blu ray like u2 or steve wonder that sound is much better. why is it happen, anybody knows?"
4,Good quality blu-ray,"The quality of the video and sound is great in HD, my only complain is in the concert track list, there were some key songs that I was expecting to be included in this blu-ray, but overall an excellent concert."
5,Dance to it ! pop-rock-disco-acid never been so contagious !,Jay and his mates deliver the goods - plenty of pop-rock-acid-disco fusion tunes to dance to. Or just have a listening pleasure while some part of you can't resist marking the beat to each song !
3,The writing was good but ...,"it came across as quite ""dated"" to me. The book is a collection of essays with lengths of 1 - 5 pages. I found myself skimming almost the entire volume in search of pieces interesting enough to grab me; sadly, there weren't many."
3,I enjoyed it,Fun and fun...most anyone would enjoy this. I left it in the bathroom and read it a little at a time....but I would still recommend this for a fun read.
5,Must Read For All,"I have bought and given this book as a gift so many times. I also refer to it often when people begin bemoaning life as we know it now.Would they rather have no regulations - which would allow child labor, no collective bargaining, no safety features in manufacturing, no safety features in any aspect of life. Compared this to something so horrid as 5 children dying over the course of 2 years because a parent didn't put a crib together according to the directions, and so a nation-wide recall occurs, putting the crib maker out of business.And yet we can have 'finely processed beef product' in nearly everything we eat. Without the regulations and the means to enforce them, we will return to The Good Old Days."
5,Course Reference,"As a teacher I find this book to be very helpful for the students to use as reference material. It helps to supplement my course of instruction in Electronics Certification, and preparation for FCC exams."
2,RX USA Whole sale Inc.Does not respond!,"I purchased 3 cases of Carnation Instant Breakfast VHC 24 cans in a case from RX USA Whole sale Inc., for my elderly Mother. When I got to using the last case for her the cans were dented some very badly so I could not use them. I tried to contact them through phone and e-mail but they did not respond. So I would never order from them again! They seem to be a company that does not care!"
3,Mixed Thoughts,"(1.) Four stars for the subject matter: presentation of ideas, points and counterpoints on issues of marriage and child bearing in modern China; on issues of marriage faithfulness; and to what extent does a moral dilemma force one to violate some moral beliefs in order to sustain another moral belief.(2.) Four stars for the pace, tone, setting and acting within the movie. A very simple, clear and convincing presentation by all involved.(2.) Two stars for the weak resolution of dilemmas and for the movie closure. Special features were inadequate. Needed were better biographies of the crew; a discussion of the dilemmas; a discussion of family values in modern China. One is left with an empty, uncertain feeling as an unintended consequence of the producers wanting an open ended, finish it yourself denouement."
4,Fine selection of arias from the verismo period,"If you like music from the ""verismo"" period you will not be disappointed.Perfect for much of this genre, Scotto is able to communicate emotion, strength, and vulnerability with great vocal control. ""Flammen perdonami"" from Lodoletta by Mascagni is a fine example.Sometimes their is some ugliness in her voice, though, and this lets Scotto down, for example, in the showpiece from La Rondine.Also the final duet from Adriana Lecouvrer ends album rather weakly.The artists should be commended for including so many verismo rarities and overall this is a pretty fine achievement"
1,disappointed,"After one use, this product started to rust on the rims of the circles and also on the outlines of the tray. Some of my rice cakes had reddish brown spots on the side."
3,Not exactly what I thought it was,Was a little too shear for me and a could have been a little heavier
1,Despise it!,"Gwen Stefani sounds so dumb, an idiotic simpering woman on the recording. And the tune, well, it lacks any kind of talent at all. It's just plain bad.Don't, don't ever be foolish enough to purchase such low quality music. It just isn't worth its high price tag."
5,Engaging Autism,"I sent this book to my daughter. She has learned a lot about autism as it affects my grandaughter and her obvious disabilty. easy reading,, and teaches one how to understand and live with a child affected with Autism."
3,Not aimed at parents with adolescents,"I purchased this book as a parent with a recently diagnosed adolescent with autism spectrum disorder, but the book is a better source for parents/educators/professionals with very young children."
5,SIMPLE STEPS TO STRAIGHTEN YOUR BARN,Excellent book on how to tackle serious structural deficiencies of your barn from foundation up to the roof.I think you could use this usefull information on other types of buildings such as older homes and garages.In fact this book will show you how to replace rotted out logs in a log cabin.Many simple pictures and diagrams on how to get it done.Also good basics on how to run water and electric utilities once you square up your building.
1,Don't waste your money or time.,"The video consisted of Lenny, a hand held camera and a few friends in someones back yard! Production quality was poor as was content. There is no information that would help you master the Samurai sword in this video. Most of the time was spent cutting through wetted rolled mats. Although impressive at first this soon turns to boredom as we are shown the same scene from three different views and in slow motion. There is no practice katas as advertised on the packaging. There was a brief interview with a sword maker, which was informative, but too short. I would have liked to see more of the sword making process. A very disapointing effort from Mr. Magill. Save your money on this one gang."
1,Don't waste your money,"While interesting as first, the DVD did not tackle the complex and masterful artistry of the katana.It is basically an intereview with a sword maker and a few back yard demonstrations of katana cutting techniques with some ad-hoc questions thrown in to break camera silence.Based on this poor production & content of this DVD, I will not buy any additional videos from this company."
1,Don't bother with it,"This product is not worth the money. It has a couple of useful tips on how to sheathe and grip the katana, but mostly is more about the history of the sword rather than techniques. In addition, the DVD froze up and was choppy several times, even when I cleaned the DVD. The quality of both the program and the DVD make this a bad buy."
1,Chalky!,I did not care for the texture. It was very chalky. I couldn't stomach more than the first one I tried. I would definitely not recommend this product.
1,WEAKwood,"If you are new to moe., or if you don't have everything else available from moe. yet, DON'T buy this cd. It lacks the energy, creativity, and flow of most moe. studio efforts. Many of the songs absolutely rock live, but the sound is TOTALLY FLAT here. If you've seen the songs live, don't expect the ""live tracks/mixed"" effort to capture the energy of your faves. No Doy and Dither are outstanding, truly enjoyable studio efforts, and WARTS II is the best live effort. Tin Cans, and Headseed are awesome too."
1,Doesnt reflect in the slightest Buddhisms' teachings,"Having peeled through this book from cover to cover im stricked by the overwhelming fact that there is nothing between the covers reflecing Buddhism. According to the author, nothing further than compassion is required to be a Buddhist, which isnt Sutric in origin. According to the Buddha at DN 1.247 Pannavimutti (emancipation by wisdom) is the only methodology for leading to amata (immortal). In fact the ""merit makers go to heaven, but the wise are not reborn anywhere"" DN 2.179.If you are looking for a book somewhat akin to Depak Chopra or to new age guru Ken Wilber, this is your book; otherwise if instead your looking for the teachings of Buddhism, this book is a grande dissapointment, read the Sutras instead of new ager reinvention of Lord Gotamas doctrine on liberation."
5,a Tchaikovsky of Class,"Listening to Midori's Tchaikovsky, I can assure that she has marked an A-class performance. I believe she's got David Oistrakh's influence. I can see that in her Tchaikovsky and Dvorak....Not to mention her technical perfection, I was totally dazzled by her beautiful phrasing framed by her intelligently constructed music. Her color palette is so huge and every stroke is under her control. I almost felt like this is too perfectly done, and Abbado and BPO adds that feeling also. Too much of grandeur sound with full of elegance, or it is a perfect picture in a gold frame or something like best French food with expensive wine. Then, I wonder if this is really Tchaikovsky.She has to go little more rough sometimes just to show that she is a human. A little bit of out of tone or not totally spot-on passage work may show human side. ...An absolutely gorgeous Tchaikovsky after all."
5,"Imaginative, rich and to be digested over a lifetime.","Nick Bantock's acclaimed trilogy reaches deep inside the imagination to the place where fantasy can become reality. The reader is transported into the minds and hearts of two very real, mystical souls whose faith in love and the power of connection is strong enough to bring them together from opposite corners of the world. Mr. Bantock provides hope that such possibilities are more than pure speculation...."
5,Wow.,"I sometimes have trouble reading books, as I find they don't hold my interest too much. This trilogy of beautiful books is so amazingly written, composed, illustrated, and everything else, that once I started the first, I could not put them down until I was done that night. They are gorgeous to look at, intriguing and mysterious to read, and I would recommend them to anyone trying to escape the monotony of John Grisham/Michael Chriton/Tom Clancy/etc. - type books (although some of them are great too)."
2,All surface and no substance.,"The series is beautifully designed and perfect for the visually motivated. I could easily spend an hour opening the little envelops and marveling at the boldly designed postcards. Brilliant marketing idea, really, for the latte drinking crowd. But. It fails as literature. Thinking ""Griffin and Sabine"" 'romantic' is akin to thinking 'Hello Kitty' a cat. If you want romance, read ""Possession,"" by A.S. Byatt, ""Jane Eyre,"" by Charlotte Bronte or ""On the Wings of the Dove,"" by Henry James."
2,"great art work, unsatisfying story","I was drawn to these books by the art work, which has a mystical quality. Taking the letters out of the envelopes was fun; you felt as if you were eavesdropping on someone's private mail. However, the story teased and promised, but in the end, delivered nothing. It also left loose ends. Whatever became of the guy who was harrassing Sabine?"
2,BORING.,"Ok, I admit the first book the first time around was alright. The art was nice and I liked reading the letters but it just doesn't go anywere from there. After the first the book, well been there done that. Having recieved this set as a gift I was glad I didn't blow the $50 bucks but I still felt cheated. If you like this type of book there are better ones out there. Try The Republic of Dreams, the art is wonderful and the story although a bit light is fun."
2,not worth it....much better books out there,"Look, here's the bottom-line: This book is the biggest waste of$50! The art is great, but the storyline is way below par. In thistrilogy, the reader is left with more unanswered questions by the end of the third book, than he/she had by the end of the first book. Moreover, the author sprinkles in unnecessary nuances and detours that have absolutely no relevance to the story. Again, don't buy the book for the story. If you're buying the book for the art, then you'll get your money's worth. Otherwise, spend your money elsewhere."
4,Broken Bow,"I purchased these because the ones that came with my Bowflex broke after only a few uses. I was expecting this because of the reviews on the product. I think it's best to warm the rods up by bending them slowly with a 10-pound rod in a exercise, first. Apparently, like with most materials, the rods become more rigid when cool. I have the Bowflex in my basement and the average temperature in the Fall/ Winter is around 50 degrees F. The replacement rods have worked well and nothing has broken since."
3,One rod bent,Prompt arrival of shipment! However one rod is bent (as mentioned by another reviewer). I've decided to keep and use (to avoid extra shipping costs) and see if the bend effects the performance. We'll see!
4,"Big Band at It's Best. Great ""girl"" singer.","The arrangements are top notch as are the soloists. Read a lot of anger in the notes from brother Pratt. It became obvious he was a Buddy Rich alum. Both great swingers, great band leaders and angry men. Roberta can do no wrong."
3,Too one-sided,"There is some really good material in this book, but the selections are profoundly one-sided. There is only one atheist article in the entire book. There is also one from an agnostic, but he is as critical of the atheist position as the theists are. Even were I a theist, this one-sidedness would certainly detract from the book's value as an even-handed treatment of a controversial issue. Additionally, I found it odd that nothing from Ted Drange was included in the book, particularly since his work is often criticized by theists in the book (one article is even devoted almost entirely to criticizing Drange). This book is a must have, however, if you are really interested in divine silence, as there are many articles from extremely important thinkers contained in the book."
3,Good but not good enough,"This radio emits alerts whenever a weather warning for a county is out fromNOAA. Each state is broken down into codes for each county. In ourcounty, outside of New Orleans, the county code extends all the way to theGulf because the county goes all the way down there. Guese what happens.Every time there is a maritime warning 100 miles away, the radio emits analarming shriek. Wish they would fine-tune the county codes to account forthis. I now turn off the radio because the maritime warnings are common, soI have in effect disarmed the feature which made me want it in the first place."
3,BEWARE - NEEDS ELECTRICAL OUTLET,"This is a fine phone. Unfortunately, none of the descriptions indicate that for the caller ID and speakerphone to work, you have to plug in an included electrical adapter to a nearby electrical outlet. (Only the very first Amazon comment mentioned an adapter). That's why it ""needs no batteries"". This also means that if the power is out, while the phone will work, the caller ID and and speakerphone will not. (Yes, logic should have told me that no batteries = electrical adapter, but I shouldn't have to resort to logic to ""know"" the basic features/requirements of the phone)If that's not a problem for you, then it gets 5 stars. Because the manufacturer (nor Amazon) not only did not state this, but rather by its wording and emphasis on ""no batteries"" appears to me to be intentionally misleading us, it gets only 3 stars."
4,Just what Mom needed,We bought this for our octegenarian parent who was beginning to be overwhelmed by tiny buttons and too many bells and whistles. Seemed to do the trick. Wish the hand set was not so tiny near the mouthpiece. It just seems to be a funny shape. We purchased a long cord so she can move about the house while on the phone. Would purchase again.
5,Great Phone,"As far as I'm concerned this phone has it all. Backlit display, large legible buttons, great speakerphone, 13 number storage. Just what I was looking for.For the price it can't be beat.May buy another one soon."
5,Great Phone.,This phone is great. You can see the button numbers easily and the caller id is very easy to read. I would recommend this phone to anyone with visual problems.
2,A let down,"Tangled Webs was an amazing book. EC should have ended the story there. Nothing really happens in this book. Liriel and Fydor planewalk across fearun to Rasheman where they have a fight with the bad guys from book one; the end. You learn a little bit about rasheman history and culture, but that is really the only positive about the book."
3,Too much for one book,"I liked the first two books alot a was waiting for the thrid forever. I will have to start by saying that i did and did not like it at the same time. It feels like the auther is trying to make to make too many things happin at once in one book. I get the feeling like the story is being pushed along and parts are being left out. I mean Lireil is a kick [...]wizzard and she casts like four spells in the book. Ya she used her magic but most of it was her drow traits-fairy fire, levitation, etc. [...]"
1,Mad Fan,"I think this is a great harmonica driven blues band. The lead guitar really kicks it. I am mad because recently the harmonica player put his girlfriend, a classical flute player, in the band which makes the band sound different. Looking forward to the next CD, hope it will not include the flute."
1,This game is so boring!!! Do not get it!!!,"I really thought this game was gonna be cool. You know tanks, blowing up stuff. So I checked this game out. Boy does it stink!!! I don't reccamend this game to anyone!!! Do yourself a favor and don't waste [money] on this game. It ain't worth it. So put this in thought when you look at this game. Please put this in mind!!"
4,Good price,"Works fine with windows 2000 and XP, the only problem is that you have to tell to your OS, witch is your main sound card, because sometimes, the OS redirect all computer sounds to the Phone, but in general is a good product."
5,Swing Fever,"It Swings wildly like Goodman, Kaiser, & Miller, and it's Juke Box Saturday Night all over again. All that's missing is the Big Colorful Flashing Wurlitzer Juke Box! Put your Saddle Shoes or Socalites on and go Jumpin' Gate ! It's Solid Jack ! All-Reet!"
1,Not compatible with Windows XP,"I purchased the product 10 months ago, but Hewlett Packard does not support Windows XP for this model and will give little help through various phone calls."
2,Alpert NOT at his best!,"This is not close to ""DEFINITIVE"". The collection has great liner notes, but no Billboard chart posistions of the singles! So many great TJB classics have been frogotten on here such as ""Acapulco 1922"", ""Love Potion Number Nine"", ""Bittersweet Samba"", ""Getting Sentimental Over You"", ""Memrories of Madrid"", ""Wade In the Water"", ""Mame"", and ""My Favorite Things"". They should have made a two disc anthology where the Tijuana Brass recordings are recognized on the first and Herb's solos on disc two. Keep the liner notes and add the above , it can be as big a success as the Beatles One CD."
4,Lighthearted romp through Pern,"Having read this well before the ""official"" version of Robinton's life, I have to admit that I still prefer this one. Jody Lynn Nye provides a light, deft rendering of the newly minted Journeyman Robinton's trek from Harper Hall to his first posting at Benden Weyr. He encounters love, danger, and the occasional skin of Benden wine."
1,Not as described,"Described as stainless steel, but pictured as black painted metal. Arrived as black painted metal, but priced higher than a standard black painted metal jack should be so I renturned both units I purchased. I'll buy a stainless steel version if they ever have one. Several other reviews also have addressed this miscommunication."
3,Trailer jack,"The Seasense trailer jack that I received is not stainless steel or a 4"" wide wheel. The described features are not correct. They sent me a replacement which is the same as the one before. Now I have to deal with the return shipping. The trouble was not worth it to me."
2,this gun's not that good.,"this gun is not that good. its really realistic but it's not durable. mine broke in two days. it was sent pretty quickly. it's not fully metal either. don't get this gun. save money to get another, maybe cheaper gun that's more durable than this one. overall i don't reccomend this gun."
3,Rods are okay,"The magnetic rods work, but could be improved. The magnet holds fairly well most of the time but when I open or close the drapes, the magnets move and my curtains are no longer straight. That's really my only complaint."
4,Antenna Stand,"Stand works great along with the Linksys high gain antenna,lenght of cable to computer only 6 feet and I needed more, Linksys couldn't help with this problem, order a Hawking HAC7SScable extention gives you another 7 feet."
2,What history?,"Little more than a dictionary, and a limited one at that: the definitions are very short; and the few, random, black and white photos and drawings are tiny and gratuitous. A short, technical essay introduces this cheap offering. I suppose the book is useful if you are a scholar and you forgot the exact spelling of a utensil (and you have exhausted all of your nearly limitless online research options), but anyone looking for an interesting or informative book will be disappointed."
3,Small pad,Good item for older children who are into writing and drawing in a smaller scale. Good paper for folding in half and making cards.
2,A PLAIN SMALL PAD!,"I THOUGHT THIS WAS SOMETHING SPECIAL SINCE IT WAS MARKED DOWN FROM A MUCH HIGHER PRICE, BUT IT'S JUST A PLAIN SMALL PAD LIKE THE ONES YOU CAN GET FROM THE DOLLAR STORE AND THE PAPER IS NOT THAT MUCH THICKER THAN REGULAR PAPER, IT'S STILL WORTH $2 THOUGH"
1,$2 is about right.,"This is a silly, SMALL doodle pad. Seriously, at back to school time I can get a regular sized notepad for 15 cents...this is nothing special."
1,"wrong dvd, terrible customer service","I got sent the wrong DVD, it was meant to be a birthday gift, and I didn't have time to order the correct one again and get it on time. When I contacted the seller, they were slow and extremely unhelpfulwith resolving the matter, so I will just have to order the correct one from another seller. I've never had any problems with any of my amazon.com orders, but dealing with ""Oldies"" was an extremely unpleasant experience. Never again!"
1,Virtues summary without effective application technique,"Easy to read, excellent summary of characteristics(virtues)needed to raise happy and thoughtful indiviuals.We have a 4 year old with impulse and focus behavioral problems. The 30 minute or less ""talks"" (coaching sessions) and diet recommendations the authors advocate have not been effective. We have been discussing respect, empathy and have been leading by example for a long time. Words do not work for our child. We have had some success with 1-2-3 Magic by T. Phelen PhD."
4,Quick Easy Read With many Practical Techniques,"I really don't have time to read, but I wanted some ideas to help get more compliance at school from my 8 year old son who is displaying a defiant attitde at school. He was just diagnosed with ADHD. The authors offer specifc strategies to try that makes a lot of sense that I have shared with the teacher...without any annoying psychobabble. I have learned years ago that it is not just what you say to children, it is most important ""how you choose to say it."" There is quite a bit of help in this book for elementary school children. If you have a 2, 3, 4, or 5 year old in your home, I recommend an A-Z troubleshooting guide that became our bible when he was younger called ""The Pocket Parent"" which covers every challenging behavior you can think of in a similar easy read straight to the point style of ""Behavior Coaching."" Both books are loaded with excellent quick tips as well as long term understanding of a child's misbehavior."
4,prison tycoon 2: maximum security,"this game rocks, i loved playing all of the scenarios and the sandbox mode is awesome. I love to play tycoon games and i didn't like the first prison tycoon that much. this one is way better. The only problem is that the controls are hard and there is no zoom. Other than that, this game is great!"
3,Not What I WAs Expecting Either,"Well...I am not even finished with the book, but I can tell what I think about it. It is simply okay. It took a long time for me to get into the book and right when I thought it was going to get good...it didn't. I guess it was worth the read to hear Alex go off on the vampires...and not get decapitated right then and there...lucky for her vampires are vain. Anyway, no romance, not even good sex in this book. I think this may be the last book I read from this author."
2,They don't make out til...,"Page 243 of about 300 in this novel brings the first sighting of consensual pleasureable biblical relations. Sorry. That's too little, too late for me.Before that. All the described couplings are expressions of humiliation or power. And they're not even between the hero and heroine.The over-riding theme of this story is torture, torture, torture. Of men, women; young and old. Plus two other scenes of degradation which I would not be allowed to detail on this family oriented website. Obviously if I'd known about this I wouldn't have bought the book. Maybe I missed the clues given by other reviewers.I skim read my way through the final third. I still felt contaminated."
3,Best of Europe The British Isles,"OK film follows a tourist around Great Britain, good photography, sound, and editing. The best part is it is blue ray is region free.If you are considering a trip to GB or in fact anywhere in Europe then this series is recommended."
4,great product,"Love their versatility and options for this product; various lighting modes. I will state though that if you have a rumbling exauhst; or in my case very big subwoofers in your trunk, you should think outside of neon and maybe go for led because after about a month or two the powder coating on inside of the of the glass tubing that makes the neon appear colored and bright started to come of due to excessive vibration. All around great product though exactly as advertised and would recommend. Word of warning as well, it will gain you attention from the cops so add in a 2 way switch somewhere reachable that can cit power to the plate without interrupting the line to whatever light source you're using. (I used my license plate lights with constrain mode so that when my headlamps were on the tube lights up as week, then added a switch between the first ground wire running from the plate to the original lights.) Works like a charm."
1,Brahms deformado.,"Realmente encuentro que las excentricidades del Sr. Glenn Gould en la música de Brahms directamente no funcionan para nada. La interpretación es a un tempo tan lento que se convierte en una experiencia soporífera. Personalmente respeto mucho al Sr. Gould, sobre todo por sus extraordinarias interpretaciones de Bach, pero discúlpenme amigos en este disco la cosa no va.Francisco J. Muñoz"
1,BAD,I don't even give it one star ( i had to give it one according to the format). Any truly knowledgable and sensitive listener knows that Gould is 99% of the time a musical joke.
5,Their sound is relaxing. Sie sind am besten,This group is awesome. The harmonies of the five guys is impressive. The tekkno song is very funny. It is fun even if you do not know German. If you know German you must have this CD. They sing about their lives and culture in a humorous way. It is a learning experience for the listener!!!!!!!!
5,Real and Honest. Read it.,"This book talks right to you. It uses real-life experiences and a direct, second person tone to discuss questions of theology. If you are looking for an understandable religious discussion, this is a good place to start. Whether or not you agree with the author's conclusions, the argument is well worth reading."
1,Does not seem to work,"I have been taking L-Citrulline for several months. I have been using a capsule product by a well know vendor and always can feel the effects within an hour.Under certain circumstances as a male I take two or more and this has always been highly effective. This hard pill version gives no effect, I don't even know if I have taken it.Very, very, disappointed and I am a Source Naturals fan. I will not re-order unless I find that I got a rare mistake that was either too old or not stored properly."
2,Snow,The color of the snow was very yellow. Not as white as the snow I purchased elsewhere. I was disapointed in the snow for my husband's train layout. But we kept it anyway.
2,A tiny disappointment,"I had wanted to read this book since I started reading the series in 7th grade. 5 years later I finally got my hands on it, and I was very disappointed. Not just because I knew part of what happened through references in the various other princess diary books. It was way too short.Plain and simple. Its hard to gain anything from this book with its 50 pages. The story starts and then is over. And its proportioned very weird. The first 30's pages is Mia going on about going to West Virgina, 10 pages of her in West virgin complaining about the food, and 10 about the resolution. And it was bizarre, the resolution was very busy. It was nice to have the busy ending to try to complete the book, but it didn't feel right. Such a short book should not have such a busy ending.Overall, the book was a disappointment. Way too short, and just useless to the series! PD readers can really skip this book. It was a waste of time."
2,what happened??,"Ok I love the Princess Diaries,but ever since the 4th book i can no longer relate to her...its like she has completely changed since she started going out with Micheal.Its like shes not the same person,she is always obsessing over if he still likes her and everything.She is always worryin bout what he thinks about her what she does and how she acts.She isnt the same and its not as fun to read the books anymore.I really dont get why she made a 4 in a half instead of a whole book??I love these books but now its like pointless to read them cuz she always obsessing bout Micheal she should stop worrying and be herself again."
3,Short!,"A very short book, it will probably take about a half hour to read. It's okay. Mia goes to some state in the south { I forget } to work for Habitat for Humanity building houses and also wondering why Michael is not kissing her that much. Ah whatever. I don't why it was not written into a full fledged book. But this series is really fun to read except for this small book which was okay but not the best out of all The Princess Diarie books."
2,Good way to pass a lunch break,"As someone who is actually from one of the poorer regions of West Virginia, I tend to cringe whenever the 'city kids visit the sticks' theme is pulled out. In that regard, this book could have been worse, though the concept strains the bounds of realism; dirt poor families are not exclusive to the Appalachians. There is no reason this story could not have taken place in NY State.As far as the book itself went, the one major point in its favor was that the proceeds went to charity. There were a few lines that made me smile, but none that made me laugh out loud the way the first two books in the series did. In my opinion, Ms. Cabot would be far better served to leave off writing the short novelty books, and concentrate on revitalizing the full length ones."
2,kinda disappointed,"My daughter will love this book as she does all the Princess Diaries collection, but I am shocked I paid $5 for this book when the book comes with a *star* stating $2.99. I feel I may have gotten jipped!As a side note, this is a great series for any young girl to read."
2,Not worth the $$,"I loved all the other Princess Diary books, but I think that this one was bad. There didn't seem to be much point in it, considering there was a bit more than 50 pages. Even the plot isn't that good.""It doesn't take Mia long to realize that helping others -- while an unimpeachably noble pastime -- is very hard work. Will her giving spirit prevail? Will the house collapse due to royally clumsy construction? And most importantly, will Michael stop working long enough to kiss her?""I think it would have been better if Meg Cabot had combined this with another book or just had not published it all. Hopefully other books by Cabot will be better."
3,comprehensive fitness,This book is super comprehensive and for people ready to step up their health & fitness. Its a book for someone who owns a heart rate monitor. You will find this book really compliments people looking to maximize their cardio routines.
5,An exceptional summary of New Trade Theory,This was a wonderful book to stumble across. It explained perfectly what I was not understanding about international monetary investment and sparked my interest in learning more about NTT and economic geography.
3,not a great mix--but some hard to find remixes...,"I agree that this disc has a lot of slow down due to some not so hot song selections. I personally think disc 2 flows better than disc 1, and I was really happy to find a couple of rare remixes on here because I'm a big collector of hard-to-find mixes."
3,Thrive Mix 2 : Mixed by Vic Latino,"Not a Bad CD. Bought on accident, thought it was some other cd I wanted."
5,Outstanding,"Exactly what i was looking for. One of the best purchases that I've made thus far, and planning to do more."
4,White soul sister,"Yall this is Ms. T, our white soul sister, I love her, I grewup with her and a must have for your Teena Collection. I thought Joss Stone would be the next white soul sister, but don't hear much from her. So, Teena maybe gone, but the rest of her is STILL Alive."
3,Useful Information Mined from Great Minds.,"The good: a. sound advice, time proven principles - and inspiring. Many of you who read success type books probably know most of this stuff...but for it to work you have to feel it - and in hearing the personal stories and the data collected here has inspired me to actually do the right thing rather than think about doing the right thing.b. how they got their information -not just from surveys -but from interviews - from people who don't normally grant this sort of access. that's a lot more believable than information garnered from a survey.the bad: despite advising readers to 'not be a politically correct' (they misuse the phrase) the authors are just that - hand-picking this or that gender or minority to illustrate their points that would probably have been illustrated better by someone else. It didn't seem authentic to me and it really undermines the book."
5,"For a non fiction book it was a great ""beach read""","I absolutely loved every page of this book. The stories are alive and inspiring and are woven into the chapters in a way that makes the principles discussed in each chapter very real. I especially loved the fact that all 200 leaders are ""masters at failure."" It becomes very real what stops most of us from having the success that these people have had and that it is ultimately attainable for all of us. This is not just another business book - it is full of valuable concepts on what it takes to live a successful life.Shelly Lefkoe - The Lefkoe Institute"
4,some songs unneccasary,well that's pretty much it. i love chalkzone! it is such a great show. The only thing is some songs like the Amazin river should not have been in there.
2,weak illustrations,"Content is good, put the pictures are not very engaging, and it is like newsprint. not all that inviting."
2,Microphone problems,"I just got this one to use it with Cisco SPA303 - voip phone. Per Cisco website, this is compatible with the Voip phone. The headsets are great. One of the best ones I seen for comfort. I can also hear great. But the problem is no one can hear me. I adjusted the microphone so it is almost in my mouth. Even then, they can harly hear me. They hear me but it is so light. I adjusted all the volume buttons on the phone and still same problem. FYI - I bought the adapter with the phone together. I may have to return it now. I hate to do it but what is the use if it doesn't work."
3,OK for what it cost.,"I've been looking for a combo watch so I thought I'd get this one.Pros: Easy to read analog hands. Digital readout can be time or date.Cons: Heavy. Thick. Bezel does not turn-decorative only. Figuring out the digital settings can take a while. The instructions are for a series of watches and everything doesn't match. It took a lot of experimentation to get to set the alarm vs. the digital watch. I don't know if I set the second time zone or the alarm. The instructions don't differentiate between ""chime"" and ""alarm"" icon settings. Pick one and then wait for the top of the hour or for the alarm to sound.If you get it set and don't plan to reset it it very often, it will do the job. I don't think it would be that easy if you're crossing time zones and it needs a frequent reset, as you would have to remember the correct order to push the buttons and which ones you hold down to change."
5,AN INTRODUCTION TO THE BINOCULARS OF CARL ZEISS,"GREAT BOOK, LOTS OF PHOTOS OF BINOCULARS AND HISTORY OF EACH. A MUST HAVE BOOK FOR THE BINOCULAR COLLECTOR."
5,LOVE THIS MOVIE!,I SO LOVE THIS MOVIE! THERE WAS JUST SOMETHING ABOUT IT. EVERYONE HAS THEIR OPINION BUT I HIGHLY RECOMMEND AND THINK IT'S AWESOME!
1,No English Subtitles or Director's Commentary,"Ondine is a lovely little film. Tender story, solid acting, great scenery. But I can't remember the last time I bought a DVD that did not include English Subtitles and a full Director's Commentary. I will never be able to puzzle out some of the beautiful and authentic County Cork dialect, no matter how many times I watch this film. Shame on the producers of this DVD for cutting corners on the Subtitles, and shame on Neil Jordan for not providing a Commentary. Ultimately, I am disappointed with this purchase."
4,Wonderful Love Story,"I loved this movie. It might have had something to do with the fact that Colin Farrell was in it! It is a sweet love story about a poor fisherman and his daughter. It was a nice, sweet slow-down movie to watch after all the summer's blockbusters. I do recommend it!"
2,Boring!!!,"If I must: we found this movie to be tedious and, in a word, BORING! Five more words required: Boring, boring, boring!"
3,Mostly good,"This is one of those movies you watch on a night when you don't have anything else to do. It's pretty good. Colin Farrell is good. The beautiful girl he catches in his nets is gorgeous and, for most of the movie, mysterious. Farrell's character's daughter is super cute. The ending is tepid, but still, this is worth the look.One complaint with this movie- and I don't believe this is Amazon's fault- is that much of the dialogue, particularly early in the movie, is recorded too low. I turned my speakers up and still had trouble hearing what the characters were saying."
4,Great entertainment,"Loved this movie! Yes the accents were hard at times .... but it was nice to let go and just watch. The scenery was breathtaking. Loved the ending.... is it a myth or real? Great entertainment, beautifully done!"
3,Cute bedding set,"I bought this set for my son 2 years ago because I thought it was completely adorable and it coordinated well with his older brothers denim bedding that was already in their shared room. I have not been disapointed in it yet. The quilt looks cute hung up on the wall (it's too big and bulky to be used as an actual quilt and the ruffles tickle the baby's face).My only complaint with the product is that the bumper started to fall apart about 6 months after we bought it. When my son was little he used to push the bumper down to look at his older brother and the ties quickly pulled apart from the bumper, posing a chocking hazard. They also started to pull out of the headboard, even though he never pulled on that. They were easy enough to sew back in and repair the tears in the seams, however the risk to the child that they can pull a bit on it and have it come out is there. My advice if you get this set, is to periodically check the seams and repair them at the slightest tear."
2,"A lot of pages, but not that much good information.","This book is not well organized and (as usual with mostcurrent computer books) has a number of glaring errors in it. In a number of other instances the reader is left with confusing and contradictory code examples, explanations and concepts.The page count of this book exceeds 1000pp; however, 700pp are API descriptions. I, too, would wait until a better book about the JFC is published."
2,Poor Follow Up to a Terrific Movie,"I rented ""28 Days"" with no expectations, and was impressed. Good action, suspenseful and plot. 28 weeks, however, does not live up as a sequel. If the entire movie was like the first 15 minuets, I would have given it 5 stars, but a lackluster plot after this point almost put me to sleep. The subway scene was so contrived and predictable that I ws tempted to fast foreword through it.No real terror, no character development, and just the same mind numbing packs of zombies chasing these idiots around London makes this one the biggest sequel flops to what could have been an A+ movie."
5,Great Film,"Everything about this film is just fantastic. I was let down with 28 Days Later but 28 Weeks Later is a great film. Everything about is tip top: the storyline, the photography, the soundtrack and score, the actors, the action, the accurate use of the military, and the drama. Just when you think you're going to have the happy feel of love about to ruin another horror/thriller film...this one quickly snuffs it out. Tip top, buy this one...don't copy it! Plus Robert Carlyle gives the outstanding performance of his career!"
5,Way Better than the original,"YO!!! I went on a date to see this movie (I own the first one and am not entirely impressed with it, except that the take on zombies is fresh and new), and the action was so much I was actually praying for a break!! There is non-stop action in this flick and the plot is so easy to follow. There are some serious twists (like in every good horror film), in which you become emotionally involved with the characters, and some of them (unfortunately) don't make it to the end of the film.A MUST SEE AND I CAN'T WAIT TO BUY IT!!"
1,Useless!,"I ordered this from the Amazon Instant Video Store to watch as a part of my Amazon Video Library. It refused to play repeatedly until I finally gave up and kissed my rental fee good-bye. In fact, for some reason, I had the same issue with content the entire time I was on vacation in Orlando. Does Amazon not function properly in the state of Florida? And yes, this was on my normal machine which then worked fine when I returned home to Memphis. I kept getting a 'you need to update your player' message. Hockey puck! It worked fine before and after, so what gives? At one point I even tried my mobile broadband connection just in case it was a hotel router issue, but to no avail. I wasted my money. Thanks Amazon!"
1,GRATUITOUSLY UNPLEASANT IN OHSOMANYWAYS,"American soldiers are kindly helping us to re-establish our society after a one-horseman of the apocalypse disaster in the original Rage plague. (The Rage virus takes the person over in seconds and turns them into semi-super-human mad animals, who naturally infect all and sundry while on the rampage but mercifully die a bit later). After a period of dieback and quarantine, people are being reintroduced to London. The plague returns. Carnage and destruction is filmed in extreme close up. There is no real point to it all, except I feel, to show imperialist US troops shooting everyone in the attempt to control the outbreak. So anti-Americans of the world unite. Meanwhile, this DVD is destined to end in the $2 remainder bucket, but for a coaster that's expensive."
5,EXCELLENT GOREFEST!!!,"28 Weeks Later is, in my opinion, the best ""infected"" movie ever made. It is full of violence, gore, suspense and the scare factor is high. It is much more violent than its predecessor which is good because the first film was pretty calm by comparison. The gore and special effects are convincing. There are plot twists and turns that kept me on the edge of my chair throughout the entire film. I am a huge infected and Zombie fanatic and this movie is absolutely brilliant. If you are a fan of the genre you will NOT be disappointed with this film. I HIGHLY recommend!"
3,another solid zombie flick,"liked it better than 28 days. employs the newer, faster zombies. the slow ones (romero) could be used in a more 'build the suspense does she see it kind of thing, the fast ones, well more punch. less creepy more adreneline. my guess they'll shift back at some point.renner of hurt locker debut? anyway, worth the time."
4,A Great Sequel - Can't Wait for the Next One!,"Take an interesting idea and make a movie like this or The Terminator. Then use the money you make on it to get a franchise going. They give this sequel the treatment; crazy opening sequence, good story, an interesting twist on the virus and a hook for the next one. Watch for the 3rd in this story to be even bigger and badder than this one. It was great fun, I liked it."
3,"Fantastic movie, crappy release","I loved this film; I saw it twice in the theater and would have gone more if I could have convinced more people to go (I've never been to a theater alone, lol). I rushed to pick up this film on Blu-ray and watched it straight away. Boy what a disappointment. I wish I had read reviews before the purchase. Although the extras are great, the film itself looks absolutely terrible. Darker scenes (and there's a lot of them) are horribly artifacted; there is graininess, clouding/fogging, and all around poor picture quality. Apparently the film was not shot in hd, therefore the print will not look good. Still, I would have thought they could use some sort of technology to smooth it out. Instead of adding to the film, the poor quality distracted and saddened me (especially since this was my very first Blu-ray purchase). Just stick to the regular DVD version and save yourself a few bucks."
4,A unique horror vision and worthwhile sequel,"Growing up on a diet of primarily American films, I am excited to see the new visions being brought to the screen by a new crop of international directors. 28 Weeks Later offers a vision for where genre films can go, mixing strong sci-fi, action and suspense moments. The set design was somewhat futuristic, yet grounded in a reality that audiences can relate to."
3,Hey ... let's jerk the camera about!,"This could have been an awesome film where it not for the excessive camera shake in order to generate a sense of panic. There were few interesting camera angles and way too much shaking about. I felt that this was too confusing and distracting to really get into the film.As for quality - the film is an average Blu Ray quality with some scenes looking near perfect, whilst others are either a bit grainy or shot on a different film stock, so look slightly blurred.I think they could have tried much harder. I kept feeling through the film that it was going to get better, but despite a few thrills here and there, it never really came together for me."
1,This film sucks,This film sucks. I (or you) could create better horror with a bottle of ketsup and an 8mm handcam.
5,"Great product, easy to install, makes car look new again!","They are real easy to install, just 3 10mm screws and unplug the wire harnesses. The bulbs are already installed in the units, so it's pretty much plug and play. Make sure you check your manufacture date down to the month, because the fit guide said they fit 2003 Hyundai, but they made a change 3 months into the year and the wire harness plug is different. The 2003 Jan-Mar model number ends in -00 and the later models end in -80."
2,"Interesting at first, but then slow and gushing","I got the Kindle version of this, and I found the first several chapters quite interesting with the background on Edith Roosevelt's life- her early childhood growing up with T. R. in particular. But by the time we got to T.R. becoming governor of New York it was getting very slow, and although there were interesting highlights here and there, I was pretty much slogging through to the end. The author wrote in what I felt was a very gushing way about her subject, which became tiresome. The main information I took away from this book was that her step-daughter, Alice Roosevelt Longworth, seemed like the most interesting female member of the family, and I'd like to read a book about her instead."
5,Arrived as promised. Quality of product was as expected.,It came when we needed it and it was in good condition. Bought it as a gift for someone else. They are satisfied with it.
4,Not bad for $20,"I bought these a few years ago, but didn't use them much. Recently my wife started harping on me to turn the tv down at night. So I started using these again as I wanted to hear the surround channels of my dvds.They are ok for tv programs and have great surround separation. Any modern movies or dvd audio/sacd sound poor. Until I can afford a high quality pair these do nicely."
3,ok for [...] bucks,"It is cheap, so.. can't expect too much, it has a background noise all the time like i saw in some reviews, but if you are playing a game with constant sounds, like racing game, you might not notice it, the surround sound, is ok, you kind have to pay attention to hear from where the sound is coming, but thats normal on headphones since the speakers are so close. It hurts your ears a little bit after long period of use. the volume should be on the headset cable and no t on the converter box, specially if you have the option to connect 2 headsets on the same box, each person should be able to control your own volume."
2,"Crappy service, crappy bike","After a long search for a more affordable road bike for my wife I stumbled upon this one and snatched it up. When it came to my house I immediatley opened it only to find that it was the men's version of the bike. I kindly called amazon (which turned out to be a feet of patience in itself) and had the correct bike sent to us. After a few days we got the new bike only to find that it STILL wasn't satisfactory. It's not the same color as pictured, it's smaller than the listed size(too small for her body), there are scratches and dents all over it (and on the men's version I was first sent). If you have any aspirations of using your bike for real biking, buy a trek wsd - they run around 590 US."
2,A well-produced show....featuring unlikable characters & repellent situations! AVOID!!!,"Boris Karloff's THRILLER is without a doubt a very well-produced show with top quality scripts, fantastic acting, impeccable direction and stellar production values--yet I HATED IT! I watched every episode in this set and found it impossible to care for ANY of the repellent characters who inhabited every episode. THRILLER is no where near as good as ANY incarnation of THE TWILIGHT ZONE or THE OUTER LIMITS. I sold my copy of THRILLER after I was done watching it--I will never watch this thoroughly unpleasant TV series again!"
2,never was a big fan,Thriller with Boris Karloff was not as good as other Sci-fi TV series. Save your money. Spend it on The Twilight Zone.
3,Okay,"Not the greatest writing in the world and the individual episodes sometimes end prematurely, that is to say without really resolving all the issues. It's fun to see a lot of familiar faces of young TV personalities that you recognize from their later works. Boris Karloff introducing each episode is the best part. The episode itself is seldom as classy as he is."
3,Sadly...A Yawnfest!,"Went into this with great expectations, being a huge fan of Boris Karloff and the whole horror anthology genre, but was disappointed to find even the supposedly scariest episode (Pigeons From Hell) lacked any real terror for me - perhaps it is I who have been jaded by years of monster movies et al, I just don't know. I really wanted to give this a huge thumbs up, but couldn't find much to spook me here. I admit, the atmosphere is creepy, especially the Karloff vignettes, and the picture and sound quality were up to snuff, but I simply couldn't be frightened enough to call this series tops. The episodes had more of a drama flair than a horror one and no story seemed up to the goosebump inducing standards set forth by Twilight Zone or even the original Outer Limits. I still think this is very watchable but if it's real consistent hair-raising chills you seek, then maybe this isn't your thing.Sorry to all those who grew up on this and may be offended by my opinion."
3,Turn it up!,This is a great CD but I can't hear it unless I turn it way WAY up on my car CD or portable CD player. I'm not sure why. I wanted to hear Morning Mood on my morning commute but can't seem to get it loud enough.
3,Some very good sections!,"I would not consider this book as a master piece but a good addition to your library.Chapters dealing with accounting are excellant.Check out my listmania lists on good investment books,which takes precedance over this one."
5,A well written summary and analysis,"Wagner does a great job describing the literati purges. His analysis reads like a courtroom drama, with the actions of the players listed in great detail. He gave enough evidence to convince me of his thesis."
2,bigger than pictured,"I am a big fan of these eco drive watches because they never need a battery!!!!That being said, the only reason I did not like this watch, is that it turned out to be too big in every way.I guess I could not picture how the measurements would actually look. So I returned it and have ordered a smaller one.I'm sure that one will be great!"
3,Elevator Music?? ....So What???,"Richard Clayderman has interpreted more pop songs on piano than any other artist I know. This album is no. 4 in a 6 series collection set. There are two medleys here one being 'Maria/Tonight/ and America. The other medley featuring 'Lady In Red/Take My Breath Away' doesn't work well. Too bad 'Lady In Red' wasn't a single unit as it's a beautiful tune. A totally different tempo to 'Moon River' makes it very interesting. The only thing might have improved this gem is a chorus. 'People' sounds very very good. All in all, not a badlisten. Beware - on my copy selection no. 8 is supposed to be 'Exodus' but is 'The Way We Were'."
3,For Comic Fans Only,"These stories/comics were extremely short. Most are only a few pages with very little dialogue. Each story has a unique visual style. It was interesting to read, (for a whole fifteen minutes). And several of the stories had twists that I didn't expect. However, I think you should only get this if you're a true comic fan."
1,Squeezing money from a stone.,"Not anyone's finest hour. This exploitative collection is nothing more than a quick way to steal hard-earned pocket money from the Whedon-starved masses.The Espenson/Russell collaboration is the best of the lot, but even it feels like a rejected script from ""Season 2"" instead of a clever Austen pastiche.The Whedon/Sale story is predictable and unchallenging, but the Sale art looks good.The others all feel rushed, and, frankly, boring."
3,it was not what i expected,this book is okay. it is pretty user friendly but it is not what i was looking for. I was looking for a english to thai dictionary and this is what was recommended by amazon. i was volunteering in thailand and needed something to reference.
3,CDs and Book not well coordinated,"I'm giving 3 stars for the book, from which I learned some interesting tips. However the conversations on the CD aren't all in the book to follow, and many phrases in the book aren't spoken on the CD. Of course it's rediculous to think that you can really become fluent in Thai in one week (without total recall) - I didn't really expect that, so that isn't my complaint. It's the poor coordination between books and CDs."
5,sick raps!,"I will be straight up. I'm not normally a fan of rap or hip hop (although one of my all time favorite albums is a rap album). BUT, thissong absolutely smokes! Random aka Mega Ran has awesome flow, and his sense of timing is impeccable.Any fan of music will appreciate the blend of rap with MM tunes, which are among some of the best EVER written/produced.I highly recommend you check out Ran's stuff. It is worth your time and money.5 stars. HIGHLY recommended!Superb!Check out all of Ran's stuff. He has a couple of albums and he guests on some other artists' work.Thanks Mega Ran, and keep up the good work!"
5,Ghost Hunters International!,"GHI Season 1 Part 2 contains the last 12 episodes of season 1.Episodes:Disc 1Hauntings of South AfricaTortured SoulsDracula's CastleThe Ghost Child of PeruCity of the DoomedDisc 2A Call For HelpRestless Souls of SwedenBuried AliveUnknown SoldiersSpanish ScaresDisc 3Ghosts in the City of LightsKarosta PrisonBonus Deleted ScenesThis is a great set of episodes. Barry catches some great evidence with an infrared camera in the episode ""City of the Doomed"" at the Grande Hotel in Brazil. There are several investigations with castles including the Predjema castle in the episode ""Tortured Souls"" which is just a spectacular sight. I would reccomend this DVD to anyone interested in the paranormal."
2,"Sometimes interesting, but didn't put its teeth into my heart","I'm a huge Urrea fan! Hummingbird's Daughter was over the top fantastic. This is my 4th Urrea book which I found disappointing. Though I agree with his discussions on labeling people, I was bored with his descriptions of how USA culture is a melting pot of many cultures. I did not appreciate the chapter on life in a whorehouse. That is one area where I'm glad to turn a blind and ignorant eye and also means I can never share this book with friends. I love the stories of life in Tijuana and I hear Luis's voice in my head when I read his books."
3,Unfocused,"This book contains 18 chapters. Of those, I'd say some 5 are filled with the information you'd expect.The book actually starts of quite well, analyzing the reasons why people have difficulties mingling and what to do about them. This part of the book really helped me overcome some of my shyness and move out to people. And that certainly made life easier and more fun! However, I wished there would've been more of this and less of the rest.After that the book seems to go all over the place. Chatrooms, Etiquette, public speaking, Yiddish dictionary, general life philosophy... you name it! My advice: try some other books first."
2,"Good reminder list, but not well written","This is a decent book to remind us all of what we need to be doing. Although much of it is just common sense, seeing reminders doesn't hurt. There is nothing profound in it.Unfortunately, it's not well written. This makes it somewhat painful to read and detracts from its credibility. For example, it's ""chock full"" of trite phrases and the inappropriate use of quotation marks. Both of these writing problems suggest that the author was not entirely comfortable with what she was saying. I still gave Ms. Roane the benefit of the doubt; perhaps she's more of a verbal person than a writer, and verbal communication is the main focus of the book."
1,I'm not interested in learning Yiddish,"I knew this book was not worth the paper it was printed on, when I saw in the appendix a Yiddish glossary! I mean, ethic and religious differences aside, why would I be interested in working a room speaking Yiddish? I did read through the book and found the content nothing but empty talk.Seriously, if you want improve your social skills, read the timeless classics by Dale Carnegie."
2,Fluff - do not buy,"This book was stretched to be 200 pages. Much repetition, blank space, generalization, and not much specific details at all. Really good title but very little substance. So many better choices than this book. She goes on and on about how our Mother's taught us not to talk to strangers and this is the reason adults are reticent to talk with people at social gatherings. The author seems nice enough but some of these ideas seem really naive."
3,I bought it for the flip side song...,"I ordered this single primarily for the remake version of ""start the car"" that was originally done by Jude Cole cause it is an awesome song. I love Travis Tritt's music and his southern rock sounds. But I hate to say that this remake didn't come close to Jude Coles version of Start the Car. If you like Tritt's version of it, just try Jude Coles and feel the difference!"
4,Classic Comedy At Its Finest,This is a hilarious classic comedy with top notch acting. I first saw it years ago when I was younger and I still laugh everytime I watch it. Filled with action and excitement too this is a great film. It is one of those movies you can watch again and again and still enjoy it.
1,One star only because of the problem stated below.,"I bought this recording only to find that it contained the N.Y. Philharmonic Rite of Spring, not the London Symphony version. I wrote to Sony about this, who acknowledged the problem and said they would send me a corrected pressing when available. As of early January l999 I have not received one."
1,ad was misleading,"when searching the web for the song,""It Was Only An Irishman's Dream"" it appeared the song was on this cd, after receiving the cd and it wasn't on there but on a DIFFERENT cd, I refused to order another another cd and the company did not offer to send a replacement, they said to just keep the cd at no cost... So I threw the cd into the trash and forgot about getting the song I truly wanted.... I was going to send the ""It Was Only an Irishman's Dream"" as a gift... So as I said in previous e-mails, the cd I received was of no use to me it was only TRASH...."
3,Good start to a great series,I read the second in this series first (random library borrow) and loved it so much that I wanted to start from the beginning...this book wasn't as good as the first but it explains the main character in more depth...can't wait to get the next one.
3,NOT DEEP ENOUGH,It is difficult to condense 3 weeks of racing into just 12 hours... To solve that issue make them 16 or 24 hours... Disc #1 is stages 1 through 11... Are you kidding me??? Each stage narrative begins with like 10 miles remaining.. ZERO depth in the analysis. No rider profiles and only a scant few second of the French TV car carnage.... ARE YOU KIDDING ME???? Yes I want to see the grueling climbing stages in their entirety but you need to tell me more about who the characters are and how they got there....
5,Caution: These songs may change your life,"The inspirational lyrics and the straight forward acoustic guitar sound feel like the peace you find in a sunrise. The music here has a message without sermonizing. If you listen to music with your heart open, these songs will uplift, inspire. These are the kinds of songs that leave you better after you've heard them than before you ever listened."
3,"Redundant for law school, possibly useful later","I considered buying this when I started law school. However, my school provides law students with free subscriptions to both Westlaw and Lexis online, and the entire school is set up with wireless internet. Therefore, the full version of Black's is easily available to me online any time I'm on campus. A laptop with wireless LAN is probably more important for college students these days than most paper references.If you don't have easy online access, this may be useful. If you are like me, and online any time you're doing schoolwork, then save your pennies and use the online versions. When you are in your own practice, and having to pay by the search for online research, then you may want a paper dictionary, however you'll probably want the full size one on your desk, rather than the pocket version in your backpack.Don't, however, try to substitute a non-law dictionary. That won't provide what you are looking for as a lawyer or law student."
3,"A worthy book, but ....","I recently finished reading this dual biography of Hammerstein and Lerner. My overall impression was that it was interesting and insightful. I would have given the book a higher rating except that the number of typographical and minor factual errors was a little more than I feel is appropriate. As an example, in the section descrbing Hammerstein's ""Allegro"", the writer stated that the hero of the piece, Joseph Taylor, Jr., sings the number ""So Far"" to a college co-ed. A look at the score or the libretto clearly indicates that it is, in fact, the opposite. The co-ed sings the song to Joe. This may sound a bit nit-picky, and I could forgive one or maybe even two errors like this. Unfortunately, the book gets a number of these details wrong."
5,Desert Noir: Ripped from the headlines,"Betty Webb's novel about a murder in Scottsdale arts scene is ripped from the headlines. The action in Desert Noir fast and eerily familiar for people who live in metro Phoenix. The author presents a deep cast of suspects, all of whom have good reason to have done the evil deed. The PI heroine unwraps the mystery in true who done it fashion. The scenes, locales and people in the book are all true to life in Scottsdale, a resort-lined city with quite a bit to hide."
1,Desert Noir,"Lovers of mystery are strongly advised to avoid wasting their time on this exericise in futility. This tale is full of contradictions, all the characters are flat and undeveloped, and the plot relies on coincidence. The so-called local color stretches the believability of anyone who actually lives in Arizona. The writing is at about a junior high level.One star is actually much too high a rating."
4,Desert Noir: A Lena Jones Mystery,"I like it a lot, now I am hooked on another series and will have to space out my purchases of this series of books, anyone who like mysteries would like this one."
5,stanley TRE550 Electric Staple/brad nail gun,Can't beat this price on an item with so many features. I especially like the fact that brads or staples can be used and the safety feature.
1,Brad nailer it isn't,If you want the brad nailer feature of this save your money - the safety feature of the small protrusion to allow it to fire means edge nailing is nearly impossible and the rate of nonfires approaches 50% - as close to a piece of junk as you can get.
2,The case is not made by Sony!!,"This case is advertise as Sony PSP Hard Shell Case and you think that it is a Sony product, but it is not! I don't know who actually makes it, but the problems with it is that it is bulky and the UMD case looks like it was glued to the top. It is also a ugly color of blue. The item is big and bulky. If you don't care about size and looks the go for it, but otherwise look around!"
5,Good book with couple of flaws,"I liked this book. I have many friends practicing Islambut I feel like the book was kind of jumping over many of the real issues the people face from other cultures. Still this was a different book than I'm used to, so I enjoyed it!"
2,Author does not speak for all American Muslims,"Author does not speak for all American Muslims. Speaks from her point of view. Should retitle book ""My life as a Muslim in America"". She offers her personal views on Islam rather than real objective factual representation of all Muslims in America. Hasan believes that Muslims who follow Islam as the religion dictates as traditionalistic, fundamentalist, and following patriarchal culture. Hasan is the epitomy of a person who assimilates to a society and compromises their beliefs in order to ""succeed"". When in the end you are still considered ""the other""."
1,Poor effort in light of facts,"There is little to nothing in evidence to support any of the authors' claims. Facts that are presented are taken in isolation and out of context. I know of two former patients of Dr. Burzynsky, who concluded treatment in Houston. Enough said.My experience, after talking with them and their doctors? Well, I'm more skeptical than ever.My advise: don't take this book for anything more than the promotional effort it surely is."
2,Long Lecture- then affirmations,"The intro with Dr. Siegel is a very long & boring- 20 minute lecture. Then comes the affirmations and nature shots. I found the quality of the whole video was below standard and mismarketed. If you want beautiful nature shots and inspiring quotes (more meditative), I would highly recommend ""Inspiring Moments: Waves Spiritual Retreats for soothing stress relief."" I found it much more soothing during my chemotherapy and recovery."
5,Right part-right price.,"Easy installation. Dealership charged to program it. I actually pulled the old one out (took 5 minutes, plus the 5 that it took me to manuever, hanging under the dash like a spider monkey.) and left it hanging. Went to dealer, changed them out in the repair bay, and they reprogrammed it. My dealer charged $89 +tax and ""shop fees""?!? $106 total (you're price may vary). I put the new one back under the dash and put the cover back on, and drove off. No problems whatsoever. The dealer quoted $510 for part and install and programming- I spent $232 or so. Well worth it."
4,Great messages of hope,"David Bailey's music is full of messages of hope for those dealing with potentually fatal illnesses. My favorate, ""Live Forever"", is on this album. His music is simple folk guatar delivering basic and effective fundamental messages made stronger by the musical setting. Life takes a radical shift when you or yours gets a adverse medical verdict; this music can help."
2,Kind of Disapointed,"I have a black car with a black interior and it didn't seem to help out too much, plus it only works when pointed directly at the sun."
5,A suggested read,"I thought this book was outstanding. My wife fights with bipolar disorder, and as a caring husband I want to understand what she is going through, and how best to help with her treatment. I thought Dr. Phelps presented some very interesting and unique information in his book. I will continue to reference this from time to time. I also very much appreciated the discussion of medication, and learned a whole bunch about the FDA and how all this fits in with a plan for caring for one who is bipolar or bipolar II. WELL WORTH THE MONEY SPENT ON THIS BOOK!"
3,Hold up on this book,"The title of this book really caught my attention because it's a question I've asked myself for many years. This book however is not written for the average reader, only professionals. I gave it three stars because a therapist I respect mentioned it. After about five pages, I was so confused I quit reading it. Let me repeat: this book is not for the average reader."
2,Average Quality Very High Price,"The duck arrived very fast and in good condition. The breast flavor was decent and it was fairly tender cooked to MR. It was good, but for $[...] per OZ. or $[...] per lbs. I had much higher expectations and would order the duck again only if it were marketed at about $[...] per lbs. The over all impression was good, but nothing exceptional except for the price. No bang for your buck here. I will try to find a better value."
4,Two thumbs up,This book is great! Just make sure you read the one that preceeds it and the one that follows it to get the full picture.Rosalind Miles does a wonderful job retelling the Authurian Legends with a feminist spin.
5,EXCELLENT BOOK FOR THE BEGINNING MOTORCYCLIST!,I found this book to be very helpful. Being a novie motorcyclist - I was now able to understand various technique and language.
2,Less History-More substance,"The material is easy to read. Pictures and layout are simple. So what's the problem? As someone who is in the process of learning to ride a motorcycle, from the detailed mechanics of shifting to what to expect and look out for on the road, this book was disappointing. Although this material is covered in the book (briefly, and in basic sense), there just wasn't enough meat to learning HOW to ride and WHAT to look out for. Too many pages were spent on when (the history of motorcycles) and where (do we really need to know about bike rallys and clubs? This could be picked up in any motorcycling magazine). I was hoping that the relevant information that was printed would have been expounded on, because it would have been excellent in this type of format."
5,Gotta Have It!,"This book is a must have for any beginner to the sport of motorcycling. It is packed not only with basic riding and handling issues unique to motorcycles, but helps readers determine the type of riding that suits them the best. It also contains a large section on currently available motorcycles produced by major motorcycle companies, along with base prices and suitability for beginners. I have purchased many books on this subject and still refer the most often to this one for basic information. Not only is it full of information, but the author delivers it with humorous stories. It is definately not dry technical reading. Another feature I enjoyed was the lists of organizations, magazines and other books in the back. If this book doesn't have what your interested in, it will steer you to the information."
2,Okayish as an intro.,"This book is okay as a general introduction to motorcycling if you're a total newbie and have absolutely no idea how to approach the sport. On the other hand, after reading it I didn't find that it had given me any great revelations. Added to this I felt there was far too much attention paid to Harleys, which whilst being beautiful bikes, I certainly would not recommend to a motorcycling beginner. The maintenance section is quite acceptable but doesn't offer much more than what you'd get out of an owner's manual with a bike. If you're looking for a guide to good riding techinques, I highly recommend 'Proficient Motorcycling' by D. Hough - an excellent and comprehensive guide to staying alive on your dream machine."
5,My dogs love this healthy treat,A medication in disguise. My dog think they are getting a treat when I administer this to them everyday.I have been using this product for the last two years and can tell such a remarkable difference in our older Jack Russell. She's just a spry as her younger sister with full movement and no stiff joints!Great product!
5,Work great!,No complaints. Easy to use and easy to grip food. Seem to be very well built.I have had these for about 6 months or so.
5,Total satisfaction -- look no further,"When these arrived in the mail and I opened the box, my 3 year old immediately commandeered them as a toy and proceeded to pick up little scraps of paper with them. Usability? Check. If your fingers were fireproof and immune to pain, these tongs would still work better than turning bacon with your fingers. The grip is almost magical, and I don't think I've ever missed even once. Sometimes a product is just done as well as you could possibly hope for, and this is one of those."
2,Hard to find what your looking for,"The book is a great step by step approach for creating simple VBScripts that could be created even easier in JScript/JavaScript. If you are assigned a project by your manager that needs to be done in VBScript, and needs to be done yesterday, forget about trying to find out how to do it or what tools you will need to use in this book. You spend more time finding the right subroutines then trying to figure out how to write the script. I remember a time when I could trust the O'Reilly name, but not anymore."
2,This is not silent...,"I wanted a humidifier that was silent, but when I plugged this in, not only could I hear it from the other room, but it's a high-pitched whine. I don't know what to do about it. I think I'll probably just return it for something different."
5,"Spectacular photos,Must-have book","This is a must-have coffee table book for any sea life or aquarium enthusiast. It is packed with spectacular full-color photos of the many beautiful, unusual & fascinating creatures of the reef.A vast array of fish & invertebrates are included. Some of my favorites include a multicolored shore crab, bright red nudibranch & a translucent blue jellyfish. I also love the blue & white aeolid sea slug.The odd-looking weedy scorpionfish, fingered dragonet & snapping shrimps really grab your attention. The numerous corals & octopi are also a treat. All the images are clear & many give very close up looks at the organisms.Captions below give brief information on the creatures, such as defense methods, eating habits & mating rituals. Each is also identified by its both its Latin & common name. This is a gorgeous and informative book."
4,FREESTYLE TIDE 2.0 CHRONO TIMER WATCH BLACK 81301,"I purchased this watch as a Xmas gift for my husband. It was a last minute purchase but was shipped immediately and it arrived in time for Xmas - surprise, surprise. The package was in excellent condition and the watch worked perfectly. My husband wears it every day & we no longer need to check the newspaper every day for low tide. Our beach has been renourished & it is difficult to walk if the tide is high. My husband loves the watch! His only complaints are that the instructions are in a small print & that the display is slightly dark under some light conditions. Otherwise he loves the watch. It is easy to program and is very accurate. The watch is comfortable for him to wear. I appreciated the fair price and detailed discription. I highly recommend the company Great Timing for their quick turnaround and attention to my order."
3,Bright aluminum tumblers,"This was actually the only aluminum tumblers I could find that were ok to use in the dishwasher. After a month of usage and about 20 times in the dishwasher (top rack)...the paint is still there with no chips yet on 5 of the 6 cups. The yellow one became foggy after the first load...I have no idea why...it's still foggy, but none of the paint actually chipped off. Also, you must always use a coaster when drinking with it indoors because it does keep the liquid cold, which causes the cup to sweat a good amount! I was kind of weary that they were made in China though...but so many things are so you just take the chance when you use their products. Overall, I am satisfied!"
4,aluminum tumblers,"the colors are great. in the eventuallity that they will get stuck together at some point in the future, having lips that curved outward would be helpful."
1,A puppy?,"Couldn't get past page 19. What is a Buddhist monk doing holding a puppy? For some this is terribly uncouth, monks are not to touch dogs etc. For me it's just politically correct drivel. I geuss the author is cute like the puppy. Not what I was looking for in Buddhist literature.BULL"
4,Better than the current EA FIFA 07,"I like the game, but I am very used to the controlls in EA-FIFA, so I had some trouble getting started. Of course, it doesn't offer all the ""official"" teams/names, but it is by far the better soccer game."
5,ITS NOT A TOY ITS A TOOL,WHAT CAN I SAY ITS A TOOL U ONLY NEED A FEW TIMES A YEAR IN MY LINE OF WORK THAT SHOULD B CLOSE TO 20 WORDS
2,Poor Design,The matching Gravy Boat while a very nice addition to the set has a poor design as it relates to the pour. You cannot use this without dripping.
1,Product arrived broken,"This item arrived with minimal bubble wrap and was shattered inside the box. C'mon, guys, it's China for goodness sake...please wrap it carefully!As always, the amazon return process was simple and painless. Their shipping department needs to be a little more careful, though. Maybe this isn't a good product to order online."
3,"Okay, But....",".....the definitive Diana collection is already out and it has the best of Motown and RCA years. The ""Forever Diana"" box set with the great jams ""Missing You"" and Michael Jackson's ""Muscles""along with classic and near recent Motown tunes. That's the ticket."
3,OK,"This is one of those basic albums that has nothing real intricate or impressive but is fun to listen to. The lyrics are shallow, but they are supposed to be that way. You should buy this cd, but don't expect anything great musically."
1,save your money,"The author probably has great insight into the subject matter;unfortunately, he does not know how to convey his knoeledge to the reader. The practice test questions are ambiguous and full of errors. There was probably minimal editing of questions and answers; as a result, a reader has to correct the errors and then try to fully comprehend the explanations to the practice questions. It is an inefficient way to study and learn. Head First,despite its errata (it has corrections at its website), is a superior product. This textbook is not worth the headaches."
4,Hospital phobics will really find this a terror trip!,"This book contains the standard medical plot-- this time, murder by cardiac needle and a full list of arrogant, stupid, or criminally inept doctors. It's unbelievable sometimes-- would a hospital really axe 100 hospital beds just to ""save on water and laundry costs"" without even knowing what those costs are? The really scary part of this medical thriller is... what if some of its plotline about emergency room treatment is really true? After all, the author is an EM doc and should know. Patients on ""managed care"" denied emergency treatment, shoved off on a gurney in a hall somewhere and left to die from lack of attention... one, lone resident guarding an ICU unit at night... ambulances continuing to drop off patients for whom there is no room... The medical plot might be chilling, but the ER itself will freeze you down to your bones. Don't go to a big-city ER room unless you've got ""pay for service"" care and a lot of courage."
1,sucky!!,"I received this as a gift from my baby registry. The pad was way too small and I had, of course already opened it up. I don't know how this would fit ANY crib mattress. I have a regular Sealy-Ultra. I'm VERY disappointed."
4,Handcuff Key,It works as described. It's a little large measuring in at around 3 inches. Just another useful item to have in your kit bag should the need arise.
5,The greatest show on earth,"I've seen Banu Gibson live at leat half a dozen times, and she always puts on a good show. She has rhythm, timing and pitch all down perfectly, her pianist is one of the finest stride playes in the US, this cd showcases Banu and her pianist, doing old fashion standards and rare gems. One of the many highlights on this disc is ""The Blues In My Heart""(a little known song Greta Keller once recorded in the depression years). This disc showcaes the greatest show on earth which is Banu and her pianists! A great set essenial for all jazz lovers, and swing cats!"
5,Wonderful Eye Opening Views on Religion,"I think that this CD is a great way to get a message across to many teens using Ska. The lyrics show a light on our religion, and sparks new interests. They are not afraid to say what they believe in, and it puts a positive affect on everyone who listens to it. I love it!"
3,Acceptable Pre Occupations of your time,"not too intrigueing although fun , if you like to spend your time learning about yourself , and would like to know about mythological archtypes to the human pschye you might enjoy this book , has some nice rennisance type images and follows the basic astroligical correspondences decked with quite a few mumble jumble repititve words that could be simplifed , the test scoreing process could be a little more detailed in instructions ,otherwise it is quite a nice addition to your bookshelf and may provide fun in your times of boredom."
5,I think this cd rocks,super thones strike back is one of my favorite cds and it has its own type of ska to it.
2,Two Stars?!?!?! Read on...,"To start out with, the title track on this CD completely rips off ""Creeping Death"" by Metallica. Christian teenyboppers would do well to compare the two. Also, the music's quality is pretty low... the band probably spent all their time doing Bible studies instead of practicing. Sorry for this rather nasty review, but I used to love these guys and have since discovered truly creative music, which usually lies outside the realm of CCM.""Sometimes one's horizons may be stretched so much that they never return to their previous state."" (Paraphrase of a truly wise quote)"
2,Bible as Bodice Buster - Kind of Yucky,"I'm pretty cautious about reading fictionalized accounts of Bible characters because I just don't enjoy those books that take too much license with the facts. This book falls into that category.Not only does it not seem to be historically accurate in the practical details of the lifestyle and setting, but it injects some eroticism and a cheesy romance description that had me laughing at the cheap use of sex and also at how I'd been duped into reading what I thought would be an entertaining and respectful rendition of this Bible character's life.If you're the type that likes a bit of porn in your ""inspirational"" fiction, help yourself."
2,Starts out slow and was not what I expected,"At first I found this story a bit boring. When things started moving along I was intrigued by the family's arrangement to have Abigail marry that horrible man Nabal just to cover their debts. I suppose that was a fair representation, since women were considered nothing more than property back then. When David first laid eyes on Abigail I thought I would experience their romance, but I never expected David to practically beg Abigail to let him have a ""taste of her sweetness"" in the fields (without the benefit of marriage.) Plus, she was technically married to someone else. That was pretty steamy stuff, and not at all what I'd expected for a ""biblical"" type story. Overall, I'd say this book was a waste of time, and clearly not written by someone wanting to portray David as anything more than a ""horny"" man who had fanatical ideas about God and a flamboyant way of worshipping him. I'm not planning to read any other books in this series."
5,Dr.Azeem Alam Khan,I read this book a month ago.It is a small too the pointcovering all the topics.Pictures are excellent and professional.Some pictures are very useful for the doctors .For example I have never seen ROSE SPOTS in Typhoid.In this book they have showed it very clearly!I recommend this book to all the undergraduate and postgraduate medical students.
2,"Ehh, its alright for what it is.","When I bought this book, I figured it would be a lot better than what it was. I figured it would be a little more revealing. It was very dry and for a short book, kind of tough to plow through. i would only recomend this for those whose primary interest is religous history and investigation. This is definitely not for the casual reader."
4,Great about addressing the most difficult questions to ask before kids even need to ask,"We loved this book! However, I will say that my bonus kids are 8 and 9. When we ordered this book we were just going to slide it on their shelf for them to peruse at their leisure. After going through it together, we decided that the content towards the back (where the questions become exceedingly more difficult and the situations address more violent issues such as child abuse, etc.) was not age appropriate for our bonus kids. Because of this, the kids have never really looked through it on their own, and we have been using it more as a guide book for when a situation comes up that we need help handling. The best thing about this book is that their mom was interested in it as well, so it helped everyone cooperate and get on the same page. For this reason alone it has been a life saver!"
4,"On the whole, a good collection","This is a good selection of poetry. Dench and Williams are, as usual, superb. I wish they had read the whole collection. The two other readers, who read more than half the reading, are less satisfactory but they do their best. My one serious criticism aside from that is the irritating music between the poems. Also, I wish the recording was on a CD!"
5,awesome,"To chime in with my top-notch brother A M Hill and rising star daughterDr Erika L Reynolds, this reissue preserves for the future the brilliance andphenomenal ability of the De Paur Chorus: awesome."
3,Really helpfull IF YOU CLEAN IT CORRETLY,"I had this for a year and loved it. Both of my children got sick and it helped them a lot. The vapor from vicks really smouth there cough and nasal congestion.The trick is you NEED TO CLEAN IT EVERYDAY like every humidifier. If you don't you'll get your baby sicker. ALSO, it is really important to ask if your baby need a cool or a warm mist because this can also cause an aggravation of your child condition. Most children need cool mist but children with ashma or allergies shouldn't use cool mist. You need warm mist.Finaly the reason why I think it doesn't get more than 3 stars it's because it's not easy to clean. I accidently broke one piece and I can't find it anywhere so I have to buy another one."
4,No complaints,"I read through alot of reviews before deciding on this humidifier, and I can tell you, it's works great. No complaints here. This machine is definelty worth the money."
1,Health Hazard - DO NOT BUY,"Bought this for out 5 week old son. Within two days after using it, he got sick - coughing, sneezing, etc. We kept using the humidifier to help him. Went to the doctor 3 times and the ER once. Turns out, the humidifier was the cause of his illness, in our opinion.White dust everywhere - especially in his crib, on his cloths, and I'm sure in his lungs. The white film DOES NOT COME OUT OF CLOTHS. We're on City water - very clean.Waiting to hear back from P&G.; THIS IS A PROBLEM.DO NOT BUY"
1,TERRIBLE.,This machine is AWFUL.Everything around this humidifier gets SOAKED. I got mildly electrocuted turning this off because the cord was wet.And it's LOUD.DON'T BUY THIS!!!!!!
2,Disappointed,"When I first purchased this product I was very satisfied. The quality was much better than the old Walgreen's humidifiers I used in the past. It was quiet and didn't get mold in it.After using about 6 times, the spinning wheel starting making the LOUDEST noise & nothing would stop it. I didn't have the receipt & it'd been past 60 days so I couldn't return it. (I only use this when I am ill therefore I'd had it over a year).I looked at the website & called the customer service line & was unable to fix it. It does come w/a 2 year manufacturers warrenty but by time you pay for shipping/time/etc, its not worth the hassel.I had to throw it away. In the end, I would NOT purchase this product again."
4,Why are we stuck as a civilization?,"An excellent overview of how violent coercion has been part of our DNA since city and federalized states arose, and how it became infused with capitalism. If one seeks to understand things from how they really are and not how we wish them to be, a useful reminder of the history, the methods, the reasonings - and the reasons we need to evolve our thinking, organization and behavior, fast."
2,Scattered Information and very unclear,"The author has broken up each chapter in to sections about the Polish Immigrant experience. The problem is he'll be talking about one day in the first paragraph, then another in a second paragraph, and then he'll go back to the first paragraph. I had to literally write the date of the paragraph in the margins. I couldn't keep up. I had to read this book (my choice) for a college course I'm taking on immigration. I should have chosen a different book. I have completely finished reading it, but my notes are so scattered, that I have to do the editing for this author on my own. It's so poorly organized, and the information is not clarified. The author only presents information to be of interest, but doens't explain it. I know the main issues of Polish Immigration, but don't have the answers as to How? Why? Who?, etc. I would definitely not recommend this book. It's not worth the money, nor the read."
3,Not What I Expected,This CD doesn't include any guided poses. There is a sheet with drawings illustrating a sequence of poses (poorly done and hard to decipher). I was expecting something akin to the Yogi's Companion...
3,Katie Holmes was really good,"Loved the acting and the characters.... but a 'day in the life' movies are not for me. While it was interesting, it was not entertaining to me."
1,movie,Did not even know there was such a thing as 'regions' so imagine my unhappy surprise when this Christmas gift was unable to be played. It may have been notated but I didn't see it when I placed my order.
4,Watch it with your family at Thanksgiving,For our family gatherings this movie has become for Thanksgiving what Christmas Vacation is for Christmas (Note that it's not a comedy but it has a very nice feel-good message).
2,Couldn't get into it,"It had a talented cast and a funny premise, so why was I not moved? Perhaps because the market is glutted with dysfunctional family dramas and this one just didn't seem all that gripping. The characters lacked any real connection with each other."
3,Good and bad,"The good...Most of the performances were quite good. Patricia Clarkson contributes her usual fine quality of work, despite having to essay a most unpleasant character. I also enjoyed Oliver Platt, Derek Luke and Katie Holmes.I liked seeing the diversity of people living in April's building.I liked seeing some parts of New York we don't usually see in the movies.I liked the ending.The bad...Sean Hayes. I usually like his work, but he contributes an overly mannered performance that is well below his ability as an actor. I know his character was supposed to be weird, but I found myself more conscious of the performance rather than the character while he was on screen.I felt the movie was a little slow at times.I've seen better DV to film transfers."
1,...yeah...in my stool!,"ugh. just 'cause it's indie don't mean it's good. It's that kind of film that tries too hard to differentiate itself from major studio subject matter....but falls flat. Ms. Holmes is obviously trying to break out of being typecasted as some middle class, white bread actress - ""Look at me, I dyed my hair and am dating a black man --- but I still won't give him any tongue when I kiss him, that's just grody!"" Puke, go back to the creek."
3,moving family drama,"Katie Holmes playes the title role in Peter Hedges' PIECES OF APRIL; April is a rebellious young woman living in downmarket New York with her warmly affectionate boyfriend (Derek Luke). The action unfolds on Thanksgiving day, as April prepares dinner for her family, with whom she has a strained relationship. Of particular importance is April's distance from her mother Joy (Oscar-nominated Patricia Clarkson), who has been diagnosed with cancer.It would be easy for this to have turned into a sentimental mess, but Hedges levens everything with humor and the exceptional cast keeps things sharp. The weakest scenes actually involve April's attempts to find a usuable oven in her building; a subplot involving Sean Hayes as a weirdo neighbor feels half-thought out. Clarkson is extraordinary, the scene where she finally decides what to do on Thanksgiving day is very moving. Also with Oliver Platt, Alison Pill, and Alice Drummond. The DVD includes commentary and a featurette. Recommended"
1,Deceptive Image,"I ordered this item, assuming that it was the hat and dreadlocks as depicted in the photo. Well, to my surprise it was just the hat. Not pleased with this at all."
3,Good!,"Mother-inlaw enjoyed the CD, but not happy with the expedite fee I paid for, took as long as a standard delivery!!"
1,Broke right out of the box,The pump had a defective valve connector assembly that comes apart when the lever is lifted.
1,Disappointed,"I have found incorrect information in EVERY PARAGRAPH in the first two pages and put the book down... Isaac moved to KENTUCKY not Ohio, The Trimble name came from the name TURNBULL OF SCOTLAND not England, It was the KING OF SCOTLAND that KNIGHTED William Rule Sir Turn-e-Bull. The ENGLISH KING forced the Turnbulls to move to Ireland in the 1500's as a punishment for fighting for Scottish freedom. They changed the name to Trimble with an I (for IRELAND) They changed it to TRIM for the area ANTRIM IRELAND and kept the BLE (pronounced BULL) for the TURNBULL name in protest.... The Turnbulls forced into England changed the name to TREMBLE for the very same reason.I am very disappointed with this book and feel I have WASTED MY MONEY, and MY TIME"
5,The Apex of Electronic Innocence,"With ""Robot Rock"", Ronnie Martin shows the rest of the world what it means to be an off-kilter musical genius searching for the beautiful things in life. Sugar Rush, Storybook Love, Forever Is A Place, The Berry Patch and Strawberry Heart are all joyful tunes bursting with childlike exuberance. Monosynth is a supremely melancholy cry to the world: ""I could be so happy / If the world would not ignore me / In my place there will be stories / Of a boy who died in sorrow with his monosynth"". After one listen to this song, even the star varsity defensive tackle will be crying girly-man tears of misanthropy. The Robot Beat and Taking Over are all odd, quirky paranoid little numbers (as if most of JE's songs weren't odd and quirky enough). The strongest cuts on this album would have to be Sugar Rush, Monosynth, Strawberry Heart and Berry Patch, though there isn't a weak link in all of this disc's ten tracks. Superb."
2,Suggest the Sunset book Curb Appeal instead,"I recently purchased two books on curb appeal. This book by Creative Homeowner, written by Megan Connelly, uses only estate-size houses. The houses are almost all 98% probably 6,000 square feet or more. While it is well written, it does not show before and after pictures. Instead it just explains the finished photo and what gives it curb appeal. If you own a house of 1500-4000 square feet, I recommend Sunset Curb Appel book: exciting ways to enhance the appearance of your home. The homes are more modertately scaled, they show before and after photos, and you also get an idea of the ""big picture"". You can see that you don't have to take on the entire process at one time. And, you can see that small fixes have big appeal."
3,Good for ideas,"This book has wonderful photographs of exteriors of home that just ooze curb appeal. A previous review said there were no before and after's, there are, but the before pictures are so small it's easy to overlook them. There also are only a few before and after photos. Many of the modifications that provide curb appeal include additions, second stories or very elaborate porches, grand entries and other costly remodels. Most of the homes are already grand or architecturally interesting. It does have useful info on garage doors, exterior colors, front doors, hardware, walkways and landscapes. What I was looking for in a curb appeal book IS before and after pictures, ideas for increasing curb appeal on a small to moderate budget. Seeing how to obtain curb appeal with a nondescript home and making it more attractive with simple fixes, i.e. shutters, paver walkways, trimming out windows, etc.All in all a nice photo book, with SOME useful information."
3,Teacher says...,I ordered a full class set and found that most of the words my students needed were easily found. Perfect size for sticking in your desk. Updated with newest meanings and student friendly.
4,"Two sides to every story, yes","I'll be completely honest, I haven't made it through ""Angel Scene"" yet. I bought this because of Carlton Mellick ""Teeth and Tongue Landscape"", and just haven't felt any motivation to read through ""Angel Scene"". That being said, however, Mellick's story alone is worth more than the price of this double print. The story exists in a place that is exactly what the title makes it sound like. Never before have I read a story where after I finished, I remembered the characters and settings through actual physical sensation and texture rather than visual images. The words Mellick uses to describe the scenery are descriptive in the sense of feeling, smell and sound, and this goes a long long way to create a world in which these sensations become far more immportant than your vision. It is a completely unique manner of storytelling, and Mellick pulls it of effortlessly. Highly recommended for anyone who would like to experience a familiar medium in an unfamiliar manner."
4,Shabby Chic,perfect bed for the french country room. the space between the bed and floor is small if you use a box spring. other than that nothing but great things!
4,TRUE POLISH LIFE BY MOLESTA,"THIS CD TELLS STORY ABOUT LIFE IN POLAND. THESE STORIES ARE NOT MADE UP OR STORIES OF RICH PEOPLE THEY ARE JUST SAYING HOW TO SURVIVE IN POLAND WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG, DON'T HAVE MONEY, WHAT TO DO IF YOU'RE IN TROUBLE ETC. ON THIS CD YOU CAN FIND MANY INTERESTING CASE'S OF YOUNG POLISH PEOPLE TRYING TO SURVIVE IN POLISH SOCIETY. I RECCOMEND THIS CD TO EVERYONE WHO SPEAK'S POLISH OR JUST LIKE FOREIGN HIP-HOP. IT ALSO CONTAINS LITTLE BIT OF EXPLICIT LIRYCS"
3,very informative,"A good basic primer for food drying, a must have little book for home gardener. I would have liked a little more ideas on individual items, but overall very helpful. I put it to use at once."
4,Murder for Christmas,"It is the OFF SEASON on Martha's Vineyard, the tourists are gone and the locals take over for murder and mayhem. Who is shooting at who is the question as hunters and protectors square off for a festive season?J.W. Jackson is in the thick of things as he ponders the perfect gift for his lady love and enjoys the peace of the season until an acquaintance turns up dead in a hidden sex nest. J.W. takes on the nasty job of finding the ladies whose indescrestions were recorded on film and the ladies are not helpful.OFF SEASON by Philip Craig is just the holiday title to curl up with along side of a fire and a warm brew. Enjoy.HaintsTravelers"
2,"A Very Limited & Dated Thesis, albeit with Good Examples","This book provides a rather limited thesis that will seem rather dated to students of business leadership (i.e. ""theory X"" vs ""theory Y""). Still, the examples are worth a quick read. Ultimately, the book supports its point that ""Trust Matters"", and provides a rather basic framework for building and maintaining ""trust"", although it seems more focused on doing so with teachers than with parents and students. As such, it also falls short in its attempt to fulfill its subtitle - ""Leadership for Successful Schools"". Don't be fooled into expecting more than a rather basic introduction into ""trust"" in educational setting - and look to business leadership books for a more thoughtful and more ""cutting edge"" discussion of ""trust"" in professional relationships. This book would have been better presented as a lengthy journal article, and should be read as such."
1,what went wrong?,"I am a big fan of the First Person Shooter and this `Serious Sam: Next Encounter' don't qualify. It's awful, it's really bad!!! This game looks so ugly! It really does. You don't have to take my word for it, go and look on the internet.The game plays slow, why? It's supposed to be chaotic, but it isn't? What went wrong with the PS2 version of Serious Sam??? - If you want Serious Sam, then check out the original on PC version that is as good as it got.I hope this review has been of help to you all."
5,A beautiful creation,"The Nor Pro Ranbow Colored Wood Bowl are must for that ""hard to buy for"" person in your life. The craftsmanship is beautiful. The colors will blend with any decor!"
4,Nice Patio Lights,Very nice light set. Purchased to hang from our awning on our RV & we weren't able to hang the lights with the c hooks provided. We did come up with a temporary fix. Nice heavy plastic globes which are perfect for traveling in a storage bin in a camper.
2,Somewhat Disappointing,"Unit gives inconsistant results especially with front projection sets. Spyder also requires room to be as dark as possible in order to make adjustments. This is not always practical. The tripod mount fits too loose on Spyder and easily falls off. I think this is a good beginning to a potentially fine product, but not yet ready for prime time."
3,Different,"It is a very quiet unit. I used it mostly in medium speed all night long. The water supply would last me for 3 nights, which is good. The fact that is cool mist humidifier makes it feel like there is nothing going on!"
2,Replacement filters difficult to obtain,"I have contacted Kaz, the company the replaces these filters and they have been out of stock on the filters (how hard are they to manufacture?) for over two weeks. The customer service has been acceptable in answering my inquiries, but I am still waiting on those filters. I would hesitate to purchase this without back up filters or find an alternative."
4,"Good, solid product","This is a good product. it has it's pro's and con's. First, it is loud when you use it on full blast. So, either deal with the noise or just turn it on early before bedtime on a medium speed so the room has time to ""get humid"". Secondly, it's annoying to have to take it apart everyday (which you have to do to prevent mold, but I believe it's something you have to do with all of these things... not just this one). On a high note, it seemed to help and I haven't had any problems with it mechanically. I'd purchase it again and recommend it to a friend.PS: the noise is kind of a good thing for baby - like white noise. I'm a light sleeper though and didn't like it - I kept it on medium all the time."
3,"Pretty good, a bit too loud.","We bought this humidifier about a month ago because I am having some sinus trouble associated with my pregnancy. I have to say that the humidifier DOES work and has helped with my sinus issues a great deal. It does not consume a lot of water if used on the low setting and basically does a good job. The only drawback is that it can be loud. On the low or medium setting, the motor itself isn't loud, but the water tank gurgles VERY loudly throughout the night. We have on two fans in our room at night (one ceiling and one stand fan) and we can STILL hear the gurgling noises. For the first week or so, it woke up me a good bit, now I'm able to sleep through the night a bit better because I'm used to it. Still, I wish it were quieter and that the water reserve was more quiet. I won't use this for the baby when she arrives this summer."
3,Filter's Replaced too often,"I bought this vaporizer because it seem to have the best reviews considering what is out there. It worked really good for the first three weeks and then the filter stopped absorbing the water. According to the directions, when this happens, it is time to replace the filter. I cannot afford to replace filters every three weeks. This is too bad because this humidifier worked really well and I was pleased with the results. I guess it is back to shopping for another one."
1,The WORST humidifier on the market,"A few months ago I was desperate and had a high fever with the flu, so I drove to my local 24hr CVS and bought one of these at full price. I used it every night for a week but after a couple nights of use I noticed that it started drenching my floor. I tried putting a tray and towels underneath it, but nothing works.If you look at the photo, the way it's designed is expertly flawed. The little slits at the bottom is where all the water comes out, because it will either flow or drip over the shallow barrier within. I just pulled it out tonight to use for a sinus infections, and spent the last hour cleaning up soaked carpet, trying to get this thing to work. It's a piece of useless junk, I have contacted the company for a refund. If you have this thing full of water already, DON'T MOVE IT. ALL of the water will spill out."
2,Loud & Leaky,"This humidifier is loud, the white noise could be soothing to some, but annoying for other people. The reason I am rating this with a 2 because it leaked a HUGE puddle of water the second night I used it. I returned this humidifier and went with theFuijitronic FB-602 Ultrasonic Humidifier with Built-in Ionizer and haven't had a single problem. Our toddler also loves the little bear design."
1,Useless. Dries up it's own filters.,"We've had this for 2 or 3 months. I have never noticed any difference in the air unless I'm sitting right next to it breathing directly from the machine. Biggest problem is that the fan in the machine dries out it's own filter, water never makes it completely to the top. We have to physically flip the filter over to get it fully wet, and that's only for a few hours. It does this from the very beginning, even with a new filter. I can't recommend this at all. I had to give it 1 star, I guess that's because it is quiet."
3,Noisy,"While this machine started out nice and quiet, over a period of a few weeks, it began to get louder and louder. It's doing its job, which is great, but the squealing noise is not. If you need one that is quiet for a baby's room, then I would advise against this one. I had hoped I could trust a Vick's product, I now know that I can't."
4,Good for croup,"When my 4 month old had croup, the doctor recommended a cool mist vaporizer. We purchased this model. We don't have any complaints that would prevent people from purchasing it. We keep it on medium setting and that works well to drown out noise that would wake my baby up. It's difficult to find new wicks for it, but we found where to purchase them online. I would buy another one if I needed to."
2,Works great if you can find a filter,Works great but it has a tendancy to leak and finding a filter is near impossible.
1,after a few weeks it doesn't work,at First My husband and I loved this humidifier. it worked great. wasn't to loud. our son liked the white noise. it would put him right to sleep. but after a few weeks. it seems to actually suck the humidity out of the room. i am going back to babies r us and i am going to return it today. it is w\very dangerous with my sons and mine asthma. i have never felt so dry in my life. and we are in the middle of a humid summer. i will not buy any more vicks products ever again.ps. i wouldn't even give it the one star that i am forced to give it.
2,Wicking filters are horrible,"I purchased this humidifier because the ""direct vapor"" humidifiers are too loud and provide too much mist. The concept is great. However, I live in an area with extremely hard water. The filters get crusty and the water can no longer get to the top of the filter. One filter actually made it to 3 weeks and started growing mold. My daughter definitely needs a humidifier, but we are going through the wicking filters every 1-3 weeks even with a water softener in the house. We starting using this humidifier 2 months ago and have probably already gone through 5-6 wicking filters at $5-7 a pop. Our only alternative is to buy bottled water for the humidifier - but that would be almost as expensive as buying a new filter every 1-3 weeks. We even contacted the manufacturer and received no good advice."
2,This Back might hold a triscot craker and a bottle of Water,"I was so disappointed when I received this back pack, I was looking for a back pack for my gym clothes but instead received this tiny fanny pack looking thing. Other than the size the quality was legit as well as the overall construction. I would buy this back pack if you don't want to carry an extra t-shirt and jeans. I wouldn't expect to get any more out of this back pack. RDE"
4,doing alright,"I bought this backpack to have a small book bag for school and everything else. Right now this bag is holding up pretty well. Its withstanding my everyday abuse of 2 large textbooks (like ""microbiology"" large) and a full binder. Good pack for general. of course it may not last forever, but the material seems light enough so it shouldnt be that hard to repair or sew if problems happen in the future."
5,"If you love the Titanic and Dear America,it's perfect book!","I simply love the Titanic so I loved this book!It is completely,historicly acurate because I own and have read over 30 books on the Titanic.It prevaled first class and its passengers perfectly."
4,Once you start you can't stop!,The book is an excellent book for all ages. I liked the ending a lot. One night I read about 100 pages. I even felt like I was there. I didn't the part that I was reading someone's diary even if it was fiction. I would recommend this book to people who liked the movie Titanic. I was recommended this book by my friend. I she said it was a brilliant novel.
4,The Ship of Dreams,"Everyone called the Titanic the ship of dreams, and for Margaret Anne Brady, it was a dream. She would be traveling with a lady from London England to find her brother, whom she hasn't seen since her parents died a few years back. Margaret was leaving her friends which was her family to come to America on the Titanic. She loved it. It was everything she dreamed off until that dreadful day the Titanic sank. If I was her I would have never made it through the night of freezing cold weather with only a over coat. She had no family just Mrs. Carstairs who she was traveling with. I don't know how anyone could have gone through that. It truly would have been a nightmare."
5,Great book about the Titanic,"The Titanic is used as a subjuct for many things and i was pleased with Ellen Emerson White's story about it for many reasons. Number one, while it deals with the same topic as many other stories, it's unique. Margaret is not a 1st class passanger, a 2nd class passanger, or a 3rd class passanger. She's a servent. You get to see the 1st class but also see how the servent of a 1st class lady got treated. Also, this book, like all the dear america books, gives the facts about this horrible night, April 14 1912. It's a great book about the tradgedy that killed millions."
3,Back spasmly funny,"This play is one of the funniest you can possibly encounter. Audiences will leave be left gasping for their breath from laughing so hard. Now, it's not the greatest ""drama"" ever written, and it does get a little long, but it will be one of the funniest reads and greatest laughs you'll ever have."
1,Overpriced,"This duct tape was $8.97, when stupidly I could have bought some at Wal-Mart for 2-4 bucks. Nothing special about this duct tape either, not that there should be.Costs $3.99 but also costs $4.99 to ship the damn thing. Just get some duct tape at the store you hermit.-4 stars due to high shipping cost."
4,Good game that will keep you hooked,"I wasn't sure about this game at first since you can only use the D pad. It turned out to be a lot of fun and really kept me intrested. it has 4 diff. endings and even though it is kind of a sad story, it takes a lot of thought and skill. I really liked it."
1,Only for Electa Bikes,I bought this for a Giant bike and when the product came in the installation instructions made no sense. I contacted the manufacturer and they said it's ONLY for Electra bikes -- no wonder I couldn't figure out what piece of the bike they were talking about. I re-contacted the store and they said it should fit any bike and gave me more instructions that also made no sense. 3 months later it's still sitting on my clothes dryer uninstalled.
5,This is the best party cd.,"It has all the latest line dances and is even better than the Line 2000 cd. I played this for my party and it was a blast!!! My favorites are ""Cleveland Shuffle"" by 71 North, ""Shake what ya mamma gave ya"", ""Let me see ya foot work"" and of course Booty Bounce by 71 North!!!!This is a must to own!"
3,Great insight into the life of FDR... Misleading Title,"This is an entertaining and insightful look into the life of FDR. However, the title might mislead some as it suggests the book is about the first 100 historic days of the Roosevelt presidency; which is clearly not it's main focus. Most of the book describes FDR's childhood, early polticial career, struggles with polio, presidential campaign against Hoover, and his transition to the Whitehouse. Around page 240 FDR finally assumes office and takes action against the banking crisis. But the Epilogue starts at page 319.Despite this, Alter provides a rather unbiased and interesting view of one of America's most fascinating Presidents. It's worth a read if you are interested in reading a biography about FDR; for history of the Great Depression, you might look elsewhere."
1,Total Waste of Time!,"This book is a total waste of time. It could be summarized in one sentence. ""If you're rich and an over achiever, stop and smell the roses."" Dr. Baker has clearly been only surrounded be rich clients. His antidotes are full of characters with multi million dollar companies. If you're rich and unhappy, this may be the book for you. If you're an average person, don't waste your time."
4,Haves and Have Nots in today's America,"I read this book a few months ago, and Blauner had me spellbound by the plot; I read it in one sitting.Other reviewers talk about the family and loyalty themes in the book, but I think Blauner knowingly or not has given us a tale about the despair of contemporary poverty and the incredible struggle to raise onself into a better life. The havenots do not really stand a chance.Blauner's style summons up the worst aspects of sports and gambling. The book is somewhat depressing, but definitely worth your time.HCC has brought many great older and more contemporary crime stories to today's readers. This is just one more in their excellent series.I hope Hard Case Crime will be around for a long time."
5,Great Product,"I have very long hair and have tried all the natural hair care products out there (i have been adament about not using SLS based shampoos for years). I had stopped using Mastey simply because they didn't sell it at Whole Foods. I finally got fed up with the chalky feeling most conditioners gave my hair and ordered Mastey online. I have never written one of these reviews before, but I had to log on about this one. It's trully a fantastic product that doesn't weigh down your hair, but still detangles it. Your hair will feel smooth and light... I can't say enough good things about it. Try their shampoos too...."
3,I expected better,"I ordered this book without too much thought as I had read James DeKay's previous book on the British, then American, frigate Macedonian. Decatur was responsible for the Macedonian's capture so I assumed that the biography was a natural fit. Unfortunately, I was disappointed to receive such a thin, light (in many senses of the word) tome. Perhaps, I'm attracted to more scholarly endeavors but I found the book slight where I longed for depth and detail. There was little new material in the book and sometimes I thought it was just a quick rehash of notes set down for the book on the Macedonian. That it came out about the time of the ill-fated Master and Commander movie makes me think it was also rushed. One of the founders of the American Navy living in such a colorful period of history and, in many ways, being the epitome of his time, deserves better."
4,"This is NOT the ""Cover Album""","The review by zstardust, while possibly very accurate, is about another album altogether. THIS Perfect Day is a ""best of"" of tracks by Reed himself. Seems pretty good to me, but then its the only Reed album I own...-rob."
5,An amazing purchase,"I was so surprised by how cheap this game was. Other sellers were selling it for 100 dollars or more while i got it for 14 dollars. The delivery is very fast. It said 1-19th but i got it the very first day. I did think though that i was going to get the PAL version of the day, which i actually found out about the day before the day of shipment but what i actually received was the NTSC version. THANK YOU SPUN!!!!"
5,Tis the season!,I played this to get myself ready for Christmas next month and fell in love with it! I will definitely get my money's worth. The best thing about this disc is that there is an option to play a soundtrack of traditional Christmas songs or Handel's Messiah. Each song is accompanied by amazing and ultra vivid Christmas stained glass scenes. I will play this every year. A+
1,Avent Did Not Work For our Baby or Us,"Our son could not handle the flow of the Avent nipples. They were too fast for him. Nipples come in different shapes and sizes for a reason- not all will work for your baby. We found Nuk worked best for us. However, what I didn't realize is that Avent nipples and rings are not transferable to other bottles because of their unique size. All other bottles seem to be universal. You can buy different brand bottles and nipples, and they will work with each other. Not so with Avent because they are so much bigger. It's a shame that now these bottles sit in the cupboard and take up space. I am sure Avent works great for some babies. But please be aware that due to the bottle/nipple size, it may be a waste for you as well."
2,Nipple to big for newborn,"Our son had so much trouble with these nipples. They are very bulky, and he choked and gagged on them. I liked the wide opening for pouring milk into, but that is about it. Next time I'll try the less expensive bottles first!"
3,Good reference,Good reference book although it seems a bit dated; when was the last time you could get Louis XIII for $35!
4,fun magazine to read!,"I really like this magazine! Lists the best spas to visit including list of services offered, accomodations, etc. I enjoy leisurely paging thru...hoping one day to check out some of these places!!!"
1,Subscription,I subscribed to this magazine April of last year. It says that there are 7 issues. It is now February and my year is almost up and I have only received 2 issues!!! I called and asked about it and they said that they would extend my subscription to make up for the ones I never received. I then finally received the 2nd issue - and I thought the problem was fixed. Guess what? I have not received an issue since. I might as well go to the store and buy it myself to make sure I receive it but I am not about to give them any more of my money for nothing in return. What a joke. I would not subscribe to this magazine unless you want to pay a year's price for 2 issues!!
3,Have yet to receive first issue?,"This is a really great magazine, but I have yet to receive the first issue and it has been 5 weeks? They did mention that it is randomly released?"
3,Get Hooked,"Actual rating 3 1/2 stars -- rarely give 5 stars.On 7 of the 10 songs, John Lee has his guests join him for some wonderful collaborations. The title song, teamed with Santana, is far and away the best cut, and will be a favorite of anyone who listens to it! (I have a feeling it was grammy nominated.) Also worth hearing are the duet with Bonnie Raitt, Think Twice Before You Go with Los Lobos, and John Lee's very poignant No Substitute. Couple of flat tunes keep it from being a superb effort, but still is a good album and a fine intro to John Lee Hooker if you've been curious.If you like this album, I think ""Mr. Lucky"", also a collaboration effort, is better overall."
2,No real Audio Technica quality,"If you are looking for Audio Technica quality, this is not the option, no bass, to much mid-high frequency. And please don't spent 99.-$ with 42.-$ is fine.Its very sad that these aluminum headphones come with these low quality.Sorry"
2,"Great Sound, Great Fit, but Deeply Flawed","I got these headphones for Christmas and initially loved them to bits. The sound is amazingly crisp and clean, the fit is beyond compare, and the style is unparalleled. But after three months, the plug at the base of the lengthier section of the cord started causing my music to cut in and out. I eventually had to swap it out for another extender, thanks to the mid-cable break, but eventually the plug on the short side started shorting out too. Soon enough no sound was being transmitted, period.At this price level, with this quality of sound, I expected so much more. I wish I were still using these headphones, but a crappy build in the most pivotal area of the device means that I no longer can. Buyer beware."
3,not as good as thought would be,"technically, this book was a good idea. however, I don't think that it turned out that well. I liked the bag of ""evidence"" but never did the book ever indicate when something given was being used, so a few items I missed looking at during the storyline. Also, the plot wasn't all that great and I ended up just reading it to try to get to the end, not because I primarilly enjoyed it. I wouldn't really recommned this book..."
3,disappointed,"As a fan of Nick Bantock's imaginative interactive books (i.e. Griffon and Sabine) I was sure Cathy's book would be equally interesting and a perfect gift for a young teen. However, the book description did not prepare me for the drug references and images in the book. If I knew these were in there, I would not have bought the book. I returned it immediately!"
1,Terrible!,"I never write reviews, but I have to for this product. Simply put, it does not work - at all. There is a small gap between the plates, so unless you squeeze it as hard as you can, it will not press down on your hair to straighten it. Plus, it curves slightly, which means your hand naturally slips upwards, towards the HOT plates. I cannot believe something so terrible made it through testing.I'm actually a fan of the brand, I've always bought Conair hair dryers and they last forever. I figured, what could go wrong with a straightener made by them? The answer is ""everything"". I'm only writing this so perhaps one person out there will be spared from wasting money on such a horrible, ineffective product. You might as well burn your money, because that will do as much to straighten your hair as this product does (i.e. nothing)."
5,Keeps Kitty Safe and Comfy,"This carrier is AWESOME. My cat still sleeps in it, I made it into a little cave for him. He is 19 lbs of pure muscle and even though this is made of a canvas material with no real locks except a flimsy plastic clip he was not able to get out. I let him use it as a cave before we left on our trip so he felt safe in it before he was traumatized by it and he was much calmer than previous trips with other carriers. Plus once in the car I opened the top and the front and he was able to sit up and feel comfortable and get in and out at his leisure. I will buy more for my other cats once their carriers are unusable."
3,"Really good, cute crate, but ultimately not the best","It was great for about two months, then my puppy chewed a giant hole through the front door. For the few nights after that (until I could get a replacement) I pushed the front of the kennel against a wall. To no avail! They chewed a hole through the back window. I would recommend this kennel for a full-grown dog, as it is spacious and nice-looking. However, for puppies, spend the extra money and go for a metal crate. It will save you money in the long run."
5,DOG CRATE,I HAVE IT SET UP FOR MY DOGS ALL THE TIME SO THEY CAN USE IT FOR THEIR HOUSES. IT IS ALSO IS VERY STURDY FOR TRAVELING.I HAVE A MINIATURE POODLE AND A TEACUP HAVANESE AND THEY BOTH FIT IN THEIR OWN CRATES. THIS SIZE IS FOR THE SMALLER DOG.
2,Strong Plastic Smell & Difficult To Set Up,"The crate looked like a good deal and when I opened it, indeed it looked well constructed, but oi! the smell of plastic was too strong for my nose and I couldn't imagine subjecting my dog to it either. I opened it up and tried to set the bars to keep it open, but there was no way I was strong enough to make the bars that stabilize it to keep it open, fit together. I carry forty pound bags of dog food frequently so am no 90# weakling, but this crate buffaloed me."
2,This crate smells awful!,"The crate itself is beautiful and well made, perfect for our 40 lb. dog. However, the chemical smell is awful. We've had the crate for two weeks now and still have not been able to use it because of the smell, which gives me a headache. I can't imagine a dog spending a lot of time in it. We've aired the crate out in our backyard for 3 days, hosed it down with water, hosed and scrubbed it down with soap, and the smell still lingers. It's not as strong as it was when we opened the package but it is still unacceptable.We'll probably be returning this crate for another product."
3,Not as shown in one of the pics!,"This just arrived today and it was very easy to set up and even though its a soft crate it seems sturdy. HOWEVER....it did not come with a detachable carrying strap, as pictured a d it does NOT have carrying handles on top. Also irritatingly, the crate has 2 clips on the sides where you would attach a strap, there's just no strap with it.This is a HUGE inconvenience for portability. Item is very light but when you have dog on leash, training bag I. Hand, you want a way to carry the crate without having to tuck it under your arm, which is the only option I see.I'm understandably disappointed. I will try and create a handle, wish me luck!!"
4,Great Product,Just received this product and love it - great construction and ease of travel use is going to be great - had problem as item was lost in transet but when contact Amazon they immediately had another one shipped - their customer service is five star - yes I would recommend this to anyone
2,Nice while it lasted...,...which wasn't long! Got this for our 1 year old dog last Christmas. We went outside for about 5 mins mid-day that afternoon and came back inside to find our dog had chewed and destroyed a chunk of the top zipper (it wasn't zipped all the way)...So...it was nice for an hour or so.
1,Disappointed Two Times,"I ordered the Firstrax Port-A-Crate E-24 for $[...] in June, expecting to receive the one pictured and described in the ad. After waiting several days I received one that was not at all the one ordered altho it said it was Model E-24. This one did not have the carrying handle or even all of the screening for air. I sent it back and just the other day RECEIVED THE SAME WRONG STYLE. Needless to say I'm returning it for a refund. This left such a bad taste in my mouth that I probably will not order from amazon.com in future. Potential buyers,BEWARE!"
2,Petit Basset Griffon Vendeen chewed her way out!,"Bought this about a week before my vacation trip to my son's house. It is made really well and folds perfectly for travel. But, the very first time I used it to contain my 42lb PBGV we returned from an outing to find her out and a small hole was chewed in the mesh window! It was a miracle my dog did not get stuck and seriously injure herself! Great concept but IS NOT escape proof!"
3,leaning toward four stars...,"As a huge fan of sardonic lit, I really enjoyed this book. It was not, however, a Christopher Moore gotta-read-it-or-explode kind of thing. I am deliberately choosing not to delve into the plot, as we would be here all day, but it was a good read, and not a wasted purchase. Try it - you'll like it!"
1,Foop!,While the book has an interesting premise I felt like the potential was lost in the confusing story telling and seemingly pointless rants the narrator indulged in.
3,Buen libro para seleccion de personal,"El libro es un buen indicador de las competencias profesionales existentes actualmente el el ambito laboral y que forman parte del actual enfoque que se esta utilinzando en el ambito de seleccion.Sin embargo, creo que al centrarse en mayor medida en las preguntas necesarias para conocer estas competencias, deja un poco de lado la explicacion mas en detalle del por que de cada competencia, su buena utilizacion, entre otras, es decir, pienso que le falta un poco mas de contenido.De todas maneras, creo que este libro es buen instrumento de guia y fuente de consulta para todos aquellos que se encuentran relacionados con el ambito de la seleccion de personal."
1,This is a sad XBOX 360 title,"I just have to say that this seems like an attempt to make a game like Star Wars Battlefront, in which you get to participate in a massive battle as a front-line soldier. Only in this game the setting is China, around 840 AD, where the fighting is done with spears, swords and bows.This could have been a really cool game, but the number of fightning moves you can do is very limited, the game quickly becomes boring (I've played mine for an hour and I'm ready to take it back and trade it in), the camera angles are very irritating. An enemy steps to your side and they disapear from view. There is no control of the camera angle in any way other than running, which slowly pans it one way or the other. It attempts to be half fighting game, half strategy game. It fails miserably at both.Unlike other 360 titles, such as Oblivion, which delivers over a hundred hours of fast-paced fun. I would suggest renting this one. If you like it (which I highly doubt), then buy it."
5,AUDIO VERSION!!!,"This book is great! However, it takes a long time to read. So, would somebody please get this on audio!!! (preferably Pat of course!)"
5,Very informative (for the ill-informed),"If ever there was a book that should be required reading this is it. After reading it, there should be a resurgence of ""term limit"" on all politians not just the president. The real villains of America and what's wrong with America is our ""elected representatives"". My hat is off to Pat Buchanan for telling it like it is. An easy 5-star rating."
2,More ranting from an intelligent but sinister demagogue,"Buchanan's latest is worth checking out only to understand the viewpoints that so many politicians (of the right and left) use to justify neo-populist protectionist economic policies that they think will save the American middle class. But I caution any reader who has not been exposed to non-political economics texts to first read Paul Krugman's ""Pop Internationalism"" or Alan Blinder's ""Hard Heads, Soft Hearts,"" two books that take on the arguments for protectionism made by economists and politicians."
3,Many songs not complete,"Good variety of Broadway songs over the years. However, many songs are incomplete, including only verses and choruses (which I could have figured out the chords for myself in most cases) and not other more complicated parts of the songs such as introductions and breaks, which were the main reasons I purchased the book. Also some of the chords are wrong. Overall fairly pleased since it was a way to get a lot of good songs in one book."
3,Big! but works!,It is a big one! You need a place to place the stuff. It works OK but it is not sensitive.
1,Not easy to read,"Disappointed in this product. For a jumbo thermometer I would have expected it to be easy to read, it's not. It wasn't very accurate either. We stopped using it and pitched it. I guess we got what we paid for, since it wasn't very expensive."
2,Changed merchandise,"Unfortunately you are correct - these are not the same Premium Heavyweight Cloth Diapers that used to come from Gerber. When I called the company (I use these cloth diapers in my business) to ask, they told me this was the same product. It is not. They quilt and wrinkle after one washing, and just don't hold up their shape in general. Amazon needs to update their site, because the packaging has changed as well. I miss the old diapers!!"
1,Piece of junk. Do not buy!!!!,"Non-replaceable battery. Will NOT work when you need it. It is a disposable piece of trash, poorly designed and a total waste of money."
5,Underrated,"While not as competent a writer as Plato, Xenophon's 'Socrates' is the historically more accurate (I refer to the chapter of Memoirs in this book.)The Dinner-Party was my favorite dialogue, there are also several brilliant vignettes throughout the memoir chapter. This is not to say that it doesn't 'drag' in parts, it does. The Estate-Manager, which is the last dialogue, terribly weighs down this volume; there Socrates is more a bystander than participant.But I give this 5 stars, as its an indespensible volume for the Socratic enthusiast."
4,Review of Penguin Classics' Dialogues of Xenophon,"I really enjoyed the effort Waterfield put into his introductions, both at the very beginning of the collection and before each peice of the collection. His examines the biographical, historical and dramatic aspects of each work with about as much detail as one could manage.The translations are very readable, and supplemented by footnotes.One issue: it is impossible to cite from Xenophon with this translation. Each page features of a range from which to cite at the top, but not specific margin numbers (where does 13.1 end and 13.2 begin? the page gives 13.1-14.7)I believe Hackett is soon publishing this same collection. If I were reading Xenophon in the near future, I would take a look at that collection, which will hopefully have everything in this collection, along with proper margin numbers."
2,Not for body piercing.,"I just got mine today and am very disappointed. I was expecting to use this for naval piercing, but the clamp is too large so you can't grab your belly button right. I've taken it out of the package, but I hope I can still return it. It may be good for other things, but not for piercing."
2,Sucks,Too big not well discribed. Guess I should have read the reviews because looking back they all say the same thing.
1,Anikine: English-Russian Dictionary of Economics & Finance,"Book only translates English-Russian, not Russian-English, so it is useful only to English speakers. Not useful for Russian speakers or if one is trying to find the English equivalent of a Russian word. The quality of the paper and printing is poor. The print on some pages is blurry and difficult to read. I cannot recommend this book if there is any alternative."
4,My Daughter Loves It!,This was the second year my daughter put this product on her Christmas list as the number one choice. I decided to get it. It is perfect for what she wants to do. She wants to accent her hair with the colors she is wearing to school. It washes out the first time. Which is exactly what I wanted. So for now we are both happy with this product.
5,Great Slumber Party Fun!,"I got this for my daughter's 7th birthday Slumber Party. Her 10 year old cousin ""set up shop"" and colored all of the girls hair-- and the boys who were there (boys left at 9pm) got to spike thier short hair and this even added great color to their spikes. It is easy to use, and my girls have a lot of fun playing with it. After it sat unused for several months, we wet the blue cartrige which seemed to be dried out and viola! it was good as new again! This is definitely a TOY-- not for someone who is looking for a cheap way to do REAL highlights-- but my kids love playing with it and looking cool. I am buying several this year as Christmas gifts for the cousins."
1,not so colorful,"I think the product is probably ok, but the color cartridges just leave a wax film on the hair and no color at all. I don't know if the color cartridges are bad or what. I do not recommend this product."
2,I don't know,"I was looking for a book about this subject to read but this one does not have the ""look inside"" feature. This book looks a bit overpriced at $145 for having only 240 pages."
5,STUNNING GAME !!!,"It will remind you the movie AKIRA , an experiments on children and getting special POWERS .beautiful , sad story .buy it , fast ."
5,Love the Color,I use the scoops in clear canisters so having colorful scoops is great. They arrived in perfect condition. They're sturdy and have not faded.
4,amazing read...mind expanding concepts,"The authors are incredibly well read and learned. I felt like I was on an historical journey to places I had never ventured. First time a rational and believable theory/concept for our ""place"" in this vast universe/universal mind is made understandable and palatable. It makes more sense to me than all the tried and true dicta. Thank you from two brilliant cosmos people. I love Nancy's intrepretation of our universe. She actually made it ""warm fuzzy"" and intectually stimulating and rational. Wonderful."
1,Shrunk excessively in first wash,"I had a dozen prefolds from 1972 that are fluffy, absorbent and perfectly sized - the way I remember them being in 1996 when I last bought cloth diapers. I decided to buy some more prefolds to add to my collection, so I grabbed these at Babies'R'us.My first turn off was a label on the package that said they were great as shop towels and for dust rags. My second turn off was that the padded middle felt like a sponge. It's been 14 years since I've bought diapers, so I didn't know I'd have to read the packaging more carefully. My mistake.After bringing them home and washing them, I found that they have a synthetic sponge along the middle and shrunk width-wise by almost half. They are now too long for my newborn who'll be here in less than 2 weeks and may be narrow enough for her for the first month. After that they will end up being shop towels or burp rags. Maybe I'll sew two of them together and make a changing pad out of them. Otherwise, they're useless."
2,"just playing this game gave me nightmares,not that type!","There isnt much to say on this game except bad,the worst,and crazy and or stupid.Much of the games combat is taken up by an old rusty axe on some occasions you may find a couple of rounds for the pistol.some of the time you will find some explosive rounds to finish of a boss(which looks really cool).tThe graphics are ok but nothing for your tounge to really water over.The one thing that I really like is the story,sick and twisted.Also the intro is pretty cool as well.All in all i suppose this game is ok for very short while,long enough to get another game."
3,NightMare Creatures II,"To be honest with all you gamers. I like NMC II. Yeah, it still the same as the first. Dark, grim, and errie. But, you gotta give up for the action. They could have done a lot more with the combos, and they could have done a lot more with the creatures as well. But over all I think it's an okay game to play. If they do come out with a number 3 to NMC II. I would most definitly like to see more of an improvement! But other than that, I can say I'm quite satisfied."
4,it better then the first,"well i renting this game thinking it would stink, but i found out it was pretty good.the best part is that there is rob zombie has some music in the game. there is more gore, creepy setting & story. if you hate the first one you may want to rent."
3,NOT IDEAL FOR WORK,"I ORIGINALLY BOUGHT THIS PUMP TO EXPRESS MILK AT WORK. HOWEVER, WHEN I TRIED IT OUT AT HOME THE MOTOR MADE TOO MUCH NOISE, EVEN FOR HOME USE! IMAGINE USING IT OUTSIDE THE HOME! I SUGGEST YOU BUY THE MEDELA HARMONY MANUAL BREAST PUMP TO USE IN THE WORK PLACE INSTEAD. ONLY BUY THIS ELECTRIC/ BATTERY PUMP IF YOU DON'T MIND THE NOISE BECAUSE OTHERS WILL BE SURE TO HEAR IT. ON THE PLUS SIDE --IT IS VERY EASY TO CARRY AND EASY TO ASSEMBLE. AND THIS PUMP IS ONLY FOR OCCASIONAL USE, LIKE IT SAYS ON THE BOX, NOT FOR FREQUENT USE-- FOR THAT GO FOR THE PUMP IN STYLE WHICH WORKS TERRIFIC."
1,works for a short time,My son is only four months old and I didn't even start pumping until he was 2 months old to start storing some milk. I usually pump about four times a week and I went to pump this morning and there was no suction! Spend the extra money and buy a better pump. I've heard a lot of good things about the whisper wear pump and ordered one of those today to replace this pump--medela doesn;t even make a car adapter for this pump
3,Good for occasional use,"I was so engorged that i had no option but to buy a breast pump, at the time this was the only pump available to me. for its price its quite costly but i guess the brand is a factor.when i started to use it i pumped almost 6-8 ounces a go, but cause i had a single pump i was leaking from the other side at the same time which was a waste of milk. when it comes to buying a breast pump it becomes quite a controversial opinion.not ever women will feel pleased with the product. i used it more for relief then anything else. my baby wouldnt latch so i couldnt do anything except pump.but what i would recommend is to buy the big double, pump in style breastpump, which i borrowed from my friend and that one is great, its noise free and more painless. the pumping of both breasts becomes more easier and quicker and there is storage for milk bottles and a cooler.. i guess its for moms who want to pump when they're at work. its also a carry case pump. very trendy."
2,What's with the noise?!?!?,"This pump is extremely loud! If I knew that before, I would not have purchased it. It pretty much does the job, but if you're looking for some privacy, it's not the pump for you. I can't even pump with my baby in the room...too much!"
1,Don't trust the store clerk!,"My husband bought this breastpump on the recommendation of the store clerks at [our local store] while I was in the hospital. I wanted one because my baby was in the ICU and I wanted to be sure my milk come in since she could not breastfeed right away. The clerk also told him he absolutely could not return it once it was opened. No wonder they have that policy! No one would keep this pump otherwise! It is loud but that would have been ok if it actually expressed milk. I got 2 oz out of it at the most but usually even less than that even after my milk came in. I still can't get milk using it even a month after the birth of my baby. While it was not painful to use, it is certainly uncomfortable. This is a waste of [money]!"
2,not worth it,Don't waste your money. Invest in a larger one. I bought this pump for occasional use only. I've had it 3 weeks and the motor is dying already. I have only used it 5 or 6 times. If i had known it was that bad i would have just bought the more expensive one.
2,Don't bother !,"The problem with this pump? It is only designed for occassional use! You can't use it everyday. Don't buy this pump if you need to pump on a daily basis. If you use this pump all the time, you will burn the motor out! I purchased this pump shortly after my son was born(June) and the pump stopped functioning in July. Why spend $90 on something you can't use everyday? If you need to pump everyday, buy the travel in style. It's expensive, but it's better than spending money on something you can't use."
4,Worked well for what I needed it for...,"I tried to use a pump with my first child. I'm not sure what brand it was, but I figured they were all the same. I gave up and so I never got a break from feeding her unless we used formula. She preferred the formula and I didn't really end up breastfeeding long. So when I had our second, I got a consultation in use from the hospital and bought this pump there. It worked wonderfully for me. My second child was a snacker and so I would usually end up pumping on one side while she was feeding on the other. The noise didn't bother her at all, but it is noisy. Anyway, I succeeded with this pump where the other failed and I definitely would not use a manual pump. I just hope I can get it back from my sister-in-law before I have my third in a few weeks."
2,Ouch!,"When I bought this pump I thought it worked well. As I used it over time (3 mos.), it got louder and louder - it sounds like a vacuum! It also lost suction power and takes a long time. I now have an Ameda Purely Yours double pump and LOVE it! It actually feels like a nursing baby - very gentle. The mini-electric was not gentle and does not feel like baby."
2,"Not the best quality, Don't waste your money","If you're looking to find a quality product you might want to try the more expensive pump in style model, not that I know if that's any better. I purchased this model when my baby was first born,I used it a couple times a week. It lasted 7 weeks before the motor gave out. I was unable to return it to the store because it is a personal hygene product. Thinking that the Double Deluxe model must be better I purchased it. Don't bother! you get an extra bottle, breast sheild and a tube to connect it. Not a quality product. The suction quit working after 1 month."
4,Works great but VERY NOISY!,"I bought this breast pump after using the manual Medella pump for a few months. This pump works great and saves a lot of time and trouble, but the motor is so noisy I couldn't pump when my baby or husband were sleeping without covering it with a blanket or pillow. The Medella Pump In Style might have been the better choice since it is supposed to be a quiet pump, but if you don't mind the noise and want to save some money I would definately recommend this pump. I had the Advent manual pump and it barely worked for me at all!"
3,Pretty decent pump and it lasts!,"I bought this pump in 2001 for when I nursed my first daughter. I pumped only occasionally and I agree it took a while to pump out a minimum amount...usually about 20 minutes for 4 or 5 ounces. But for the occasional use, highly recommend a single pump.5 1/2 years later the pump still works with all it's original parts! I currently pump every couple of days so my husband can help feed this 2nd baby girl and my gosh, I'll never go to the grocery store without a bottle again! LOLOf all the pumps I've heard of the the medela is the one most recommended.I only gave this a 3 because yeah, the pump is a bit loud, although the sound puts my baby to sleep, and it does take the 20 minutes to pump a bit!"
4,does the job,i've been using a hand pump for the last 6 weeks and basically stopped pumping for a couple weeks because it was so time consuming and labor intensive (sore hand/arm) I just got this pump yesterday and it is definitely not super effective but it is much more effective than a hand pump for me and its nice to not have to be squeezing the thing the whole time. For engorgement it is less painful than the hand pump. Of course I have a well established milk supply and am 6 weeks post baby so I am not using it to specifically increase my supply so much as to ensure that I always have some milk in the freezer for outings. I try to pump a few times a day so that I have at least one whole bottle's worth pumped every day. I can easily get a couple of ounces out at a time and I think its faster than a hand pump too.
3,"works ok, probably not the best pump","I bought this pump after having used the Avent Isis. I went to full expression for my baby and ended up spending several hours on the pump everyday, so getting an electric was clearly a must!This pump works, and you don't end up with sore muscles as with the Avent Isis. At the same time, I am not convinced it is as efficient as the Avent Isis... The good point is that I have one hand free when using this pump, which I did not have with the Isis. The bad point is that I probably spend a bit more time with this one than I would need with a better pump. And it is REALLY loud, so there is no way I can watch a DVD while expressing.As I plan to carry on to express several times per day, I am getting a Medela pump in style, everybody says it's a great pump, and the double pumping will no doubt save me time."
2,Not an introduction,"Purchased this book, looking for a beginer's guide to start waterguilding my own frames. It was NOT an easy step by step instruction book. Authors seem very well versed in subject. But it was not easy for a beginner to follow."
2,A brief intro with gaping holes,"I can deal with the coy jokes scattered within the side-notes. I can handle the briefity of each section. But there are a lot of concepts that the authors just jump right into without explaining what the terms mean or the tools involved. What is ""asphaltum""? Don't you think that it should be defined before jumping into an entire section on it? I'm not above looking things up, but I don't think that I should have to supplement an instructional book for beginners.The authors are kind enough to share recipes; most gilding books list the general ingredients and then encourage you to experiement with your portions to get a working recipe. But, the book seems to create more questions than it provides answers."
3,ok until now!,I've used these bottles since my sons were born.-I love the fact that they are extremely easy to clean and the liners are very convenient. (but are getting expensive.) I would use these bottles up until you need to make 8oz of formula. *If you use powder formula - the drop-in liners DO NOT hold 8oz of water and the formula you add to it!! I had a mess of formula everywhere!!!
2,busted box baby bottles,When I received these bottles the box was all mashed up. Since this was a gift i was not pleased but the new mom to be didnt seem to care so thats good. Or maybe she just did not want to say anything bad. Great price just not sure you want to give a mashed box for a gift. I dont know if the bottles were damaged inside bc i didnt open it. Well hope that helps you make a decision.
2,Did not work for me and my baby,"With all the rave reviews and my love for Playtex VentAir bottles, I was very excited about this bottle. Yet, both me and my baby hated it. First off, the bottle itself is huge, which makes it uncomfortable in many ways. Second, even the slow flow nipple somehow seems too fast and makes my baby choke on his milk. In any case, we used it a couple of times and went right back to VentAir. I would not recommend it."
3,"Great bottles, for awhile anyway","I used these bottles on my son until he was 2 months old. It just started getting too expensive having to buy the drop-ins all the time. When you wake up at 2 or so in the morning and have to remember to push the drop-ins to release all the air, not so great. Other than that, the bottles helped prevent his gas from being bad."
3,"Great, but lacking medium flow nipples","I rated this 3 stars because while it has many good parts, I was highly disappointed to ""realize"" when my baby was 4 months old that this set does *not* include any medium flow nipples. We used the slow flow for several months, so those were useful, but the Fast flow were way too fast and we needed something in-between. Low & behold I walk down the aisle in Target looking for an entirely new bottle system and I see medium nipples that work perfectly for my daughter. For trying to offer a variety of nipple options, Playtex missed the mark in omitting the medium flow nipple."
2,A ridiculous book,"This book isn't worth reading at all. It got me frusterated the way they talk, the way they think. At times, the book was ok, but not really. Read something else. Anything else. If your obsessed w/ Little Women, then this will probably teach u a little bit more about it, but don't count on it. Don't spend your time or money on this book.~Atalanta"
2,Started out Great,We recieved this as a gift and at frist it was great. We could keep it in the room with us and the baby and make things easier for night time feedings. We have had very few problems with heating to the right tempature. I have realy liked the warmer untill yesterday. I heated a bottle for my daughter at 12 and it worked great but when I went to heat one at 3:30 the unit never heated up. We have worked and worked with it but the heating element seems to have quit working. My little gril is only six weeks old and we have used the warmer mostly at nights so I can't see that we have over used it. This is the second frist years product that has stopped working for us in the frist six weeks.
1,Poor function and unsafe for nursery,"We have been very disappointed with the performance of the bottle warmer. We have used it several times to try to warm up less than 4 oz of milk and it's never warm enough. By the time the item cools down to use it again (10 minutes), the bottle has lost any heat it had. Also, even though it warns not to stay too close to the unit as it heats, my husband and I think the steam which spits out of the heating element is too dangerous for a nursery. We will be returning ours in order to find a better quality and safer bottle warmer."
2,This product is a waste of money!,"The only thing this product is good for is to keep the bottles cool at night. The temperature is NEVER consistent with the warmer, and the bottles end up being either too hot or too cold. We used this to keep the bottles cool, and then warmed them with a different warmer in our master bathroom. No matter how precise we were with our measurements (and my Engineer husband is very precise), we could never obtain consistent results with the warming function - very frustrating. I do not recommend this product."
1,"TERRIBLE PRODUCT WILL BREAK DOWN BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, DO NOT BUY!","WE just used this product for only 5 months and it stopped working and as our luck would have it, it is over the 90-days warranty and you pretty much are screwed! We followed their instructions on cleaning. Also, we inquired with friends and found out that the same thing happened to two of them. I would stay away from this particular product if I were you!"
3,This was great for about 3 wks,"I don't know if we bought a defective warmer or if we just don't know how to use it right. We haven't had to use the cooler because we have a small refrigerator in the baby's room so I can't comment on that. But the warmer has never warmed the bottles consistantly. We put the same amount of water in every time and sometimes it's just right and sometimes it's too hot. We've had this warmer 3 1/2 weeks and now it is starting to not work. It is frustrating to put a bottle in, change my baby's diaper (while he's hungry) and then go to find my bottle is still cold. I even hold my hand over the warmer at first to see if it is warming and it seems to be but it's not. It works about every 3rd time. I give it 3 stars only because I haven't used the cooler part and can't comment on whether it works good or not. I'm not sure what we are going to do about this warmer but if we buy a new one, it won't be another one of these."
4,great for new parents,being parents for the first time is hard enough and by having something so quick and easy to use like this was wonderful. our son was nursed the first month & when we switched to formula it was hard to get the bottle warm fast enough for him in the middle of the night but with the night and day bottle warmer by the time we got the bottle started and him changed it was all ready for him. i recommend filling a bottle with cold water & heating it to the warmth you prefer for your baby so you know what amount of water you need to fill your water gauge with(the numbers on our gauge wore off quickly & it made us know an estimate of how much water we neede to heat it with). we liked this so much we got the first years bottle travel system (cooler with a car travel bottle warmer). definatly a must have!
1,Completely Worthless,"I bought this bottle warmer two months ago shortly after my baby was born, then all of a sudden for no reason it just stopped working. The button you need to press to activate the warmer just didn't work anymore. The one-year limited warranty states that the warmer need to be shipped back to them and they will decide at their option if they will replace it or repair it. But what are you supposed to do in the meantime to heat bottles? Save your money and buy a different warmer."
1,"Not as ""convenient"" as it appears","I was very disappointed with this bottle warmer. The warmed bottle tempature was very inconsistent...ranging from scalding hot to just about warm. (even when using the same amount of water with the same size bottle each time!) If the bottle isn't warm enough, it is difficult to reset the warmer to rewarm the bottle-the button just won't go back down until the unit cools down. I also had a problem with the warmer not automatically shutting off as it was supposed to, which resulted in the bottle over-heating and exploding all over my kitchen...electricity and liquid-not a good combination. Very dangerous! Luckily, My baby and I were not in the room at the time.I found the cooler portion of the unit to not keep the bottles cold/cool throughout an 8 hour period as the box states.Overall, I was very disappointed with it and after the ""overheated exploding bottle episode"" I brought it back. I find it faster and safer to warm a bottle in hot tap water."
3,Works well but.....,"My mother bought this product for me about a week ago. I use it to heat every bottle for my 6 week old son, and I think once did it heat the bottle to his favorite temperature. The directions state to heat a 4 ounce bottle to fill the water reservior to the lower fill line. That just creates enough steam to make the bottle itself a little warm, it doesn't change the temperature of the formula at all. I have found myself just adding a lot of water, and standing by the steamer, checking the bottle periodically until it's the right temperature. It's a nice steamer, and helps me out a lot... it just doesn't do all of what it has promised."
2,Not worth it!,It is a great idea but doesn't work!!! It's very frustrating because my bottles get either too warm or stay too cold. There's got to be a better way to warm a bottle. I was pumping breast milk and it got my milk too hot. Nothing angers me more than wasting breast milk. I called the manufacturer and they told me to put less water in and I did that. The bottle didn't get warm enough. Don't waste your money.
1,The most frustrating of baby eqipment,"My wife and I decided, since we were having twins, to spend more on a bottle warmer than we did when our daughter was born. We bought this bottle warmer, and we have found it to be unreliable, and, even, unsafe. First, sometimes it cuts off for no reason, sometimes it will not even turn on. Several times, the milk is scalding hot, so we have to wait minutes for the milk to get down to a drinkable temperature. Take my advice - do not buy this product. Warm water in the microwave, and warm your bottles that way."
1,Not Impressed!,"This product did not serve our needs as we use playtex disposable bottles - although the product claims to heat all bottles, disposable included, it did not work with the Playtex bottles. We returned it promptly. (Also, when I purchased this product at [the store], I noticed that all the product boxes were taped shut - I should have guessed that the product was not a good one as those must have been returns.)"
1,Not for Breast Milk or Glass Bottles,"So we thought the features like the cooling and heating would be great, nowhere did it say it would not work with glass bottles until we opened it. Then for Breast Milk you basically have to heat it twice so the 5 min turns into 20 min (5 plus 10 for cool down plus another 5) This was a great disappointment and I am happily packing it up for return."
1,Poor design improved by sawing in half,"The warmer is bulky and poorly designed, with awkward caps and measuring tubes that easily fall to the floor. After 7 months of never using the insulated compartment, I finally sawed the warmer in half and removed the entire back of the device. It's much improved -- fewer useless parts and takes up half the space.I would only buy this warmer again if I lived somewhere with no running water or refrigeration at night. If you make bottles in your kitchen, this is not the product for you. Find a smaller, cylinder-style warmer instead."
2,Not worth it!!!,We have bottle warmers on every floor since we have twins...this by far is the worst of the 3 we purchased. It takes forever to warm the bottles and you have to wait til it is completely cooled down to use it again. I don't recommend it if you have to warm more than 1 bottle. With twins one always has to wait or we have to go to another floor to warm their bottle.
2,Useful,"This gadget was helpful in warming half finished bottles early on, but not so much after we bought a hot/cold water bottle stand. I never knew how much water to steam for the amount of liquid being warmed. I found it mor trouble and time consuming than it was worth."
1,Don't waste your money,"I would have given this zero stars, if it was an option. Believe the reviewers when they state it doesn't work. It either over heats or doesn't heat at all. The cups used to measure are worthless, and don't even bother heating a normal sized bottle. We found the only bottles that somewhat worked with this warmer were the wide/fat bottles. Even then the heating was inconsistent. I would sell this at a garage sale, but I would hate to rip somone off and put them through the pain of even trying this product."
1,Waste of money,"This is a waste of money. Not only that it takes much longer to warm up a bottle with this awful thing then it would be with simple putting in hot water, but when it does go through its cycle, the bottle either still cold or too hot. I followed all the instructions, my husband read the instructions, my friends read the instructions, and we seem to do it right. But its just not working out for us."
2,Easier to go get the bottle,"Since I was getting tired of running downstairs for the bottles, I purchased this product. It keeps the bottles cold overnight. However, by the time I change the diaper and bib him, I have to wait too long. I don't use it anymore. Just save yourself time and go down and microwave the bottle."
2,WASTE OF MONEY,"In my opinion, bottle warmers are a waste of money. I used a couple of different ones and they are all the same (THEY DON'T WORK ALL THE TIME). When you have a screaming baby that is waiting to be fed, you don't have the time to play around. I know alot you may not agree, but I pop the bottle in the microwave for 20 seconds or so (depending on how many ounces) and shake up the bottle real good when it is done in case of those hot spots you hear about and we are good to go (both mommy and baby are happy in record timing). I was given this same advice from other conditioned moms and was skeptical in the beginning, but they were all right! It just takes a little common sense when you are heating up a babies bottle in the microwave."
2,Warmer lag at startup!,"The warmer doesn't work well. Once it turns off, you can't heat up any more bottles for several minutes! We bought the single bottle warmer (by the First Years but without the cooler) it works fine. You can heat 2 bottles consecutively without having to wait for the warmer to cool off. If you need to have a cooler, just use a mini ice chest!"
5,Great,"I Love it, my new born love the fact that he does not have to way for us to go to the kitchen and prepair his formula.JuanJRojasBoston, MA"
2,"Great Concept, Not a Great product...","I loved the concept, especially since our bedroom is upstairs. The thermos part works great for keeping bottles cold overnight, but the warming part is so inconsistent. I try to use the same amount of water each time. It really is hit or miss. Sometimes it is warm, but most of the time it is too cold. There has been a couple of times it is too hot. Very frustrating. I will be looking for another warmer."
1,Dangerous product. Waste of money!!,"I agree with all the other reviews saying the warmer with burn your hands and overheat the bottle. Especially when you only have a few oz in the bottle. The water in the warmer actually BOIL when it heats up and if the bottle got stuck in the handle, it means you have to use your bare hands to separate the boiled bottle and the boiled handle. You end up having a boiled hand as well. The worst part is it will burn your love one....Not only that, the cooler does not close well so the content will not really be kept fresh even the ice-pack is frozen before placing into the cooler. We switched to AVENT warmer. A little more $$ but it is much better. I would NOT recommend this product."
5,This is the same as daylight,This bulb produces the equivalent to sunlight. I put them in cheap lights with an aluminum reflector and clamp from the hardware store. It works good because what you see is what you get. The bulbs are very hot so you have to be careful. I use a few at a time to take portraits of my kids. These eliminate shadows.
4,It's a cool lil cd,The cd is cool fo what it is i like all the songs but the one that he had weak people on but i wanna know is when twist is comin out with another cd or videoholla back
1,Don't buy it,"I did not like this book because the answers are not available and my teacher is lazy and probably wouldn't give us the answers if we asked. I think it was a waste of money and good trees. I think this belongs in the trash along with all the other study guide books I have bought. On a side note, the main textbook is too big and heavy and I hate carrying it around. I think the type should be bigger or get rid of some of the content because when you are reading late at night it all runs together. I think that's enough ranting and raving so I will leave it at this my book is going to be out the window July 29 the day of my final. Good riddance!!!!!!!!!"
4,Buy the game Jambroni's,"I think the game kicks butt, This actually is the first wrestling game i have bought and I think its pretty awesome. I am an architect and my roomate is a lawyer, we both enjoy it. I think the only complaint i have is that during the cage match if your the one trying to get out, the guys move so damn slow, and cage matches take so long. So i usually just skip it. If there is any sure thing then this game is it, rather then being stuck with a game that sucks, mostly everyone who reviewed it are correct. So buy that game."
5,The most electrifying game in sports entertainment.,wwf smackdown is a very nice game. i have researched about this game a lot and have found that this is going to be a very popular game. it has a very in depth story mode. which means that it makes you feel that youre accually in a show. this is a game that keeps on going even after you have won the title. the graphics are the best ive seen in any game. it makes doing a move very easy. the create a wrestler mode is very easy to create. it has a match called a special guest referee match where you can be a referee and you can count a wrestler out slowly or quickly and even get a piece of the action by hitting a wrestler. and as i finish i still think that this is a absolutely fantastic game.bye
1,Gee maybe we should have thought of that....,"This product would be fantastic but for one big problem...it is almost impossible to replace the batteries. They have the battery case high on the back of the system under the 'hook' with an odd sized screwdriver. After struggling with it for more than a year...with it only working for about a week and then sitting with dead batteries for 3 or 4 months at a time, we are finally throwing it away."
4,LIFESAVER,"We love this at our house. I can put my baby in it at night, turn on the music and in no time he is asleep for good. No pacifier, nothing. The only downfall is the amount of batteries it goes through, but definitely worth it!! Love this product!!"
2,NOT TOO HAPPY,"I gave this item 2 stars b/c that's how long it lasted. 2 weeks. It no longer works.....NOT HAPPY! The 2 weeks it did work, it did seem to calm and soothe our newborn."
2,"Good for younger infants, not for older infants.","My son loved this lullaby player from 3-6 months, but about the 7th month he started to realize that the sounds on the lullaby player meant it was bedtime, and the fight to get him to sleep was horrid after he'd hear the sounds. He's at the age where he really fights it. We love our Ocean Wonders Aquarium now, and we have the Crib CD player and he loves that too. I would definitely recommend the crib cd player and some baby einstein classical cds over this player."
4,The ORANGE book is MUCH better!!,"This yellow book has nothing in it you can't figure out yourself.The Orange ""THE COMPLETE IDIOTS GUIDE TO GEOCACHING"" is MUCH MUCH better! Everything from helpfull hints that even experienced geocachers can use, to the complete history of geocaching, how it started, and EVERYTHING you want to know about Latitude and Longitude and all the formats it is measured with and how they came about.The other book is MUCH better than this one!"
5,Patti Patti Patti,"Patti Patti Patti.....Timeless Journey is a dream come true. I've been a huge fan for a number of years but never felt that her vocal intensity was captured on record. I dreamed of the day that someone would give her material worthy of her immense vocal gift. Well my dream finally came true and the result is a match made in music heaven. The vocal arrangements are tight, the lyrics are fresh and age appropriate, and the production is top notch. This is the first cd I've purchased in years that I can play without having to forward through several songs. I love every song but Two Steps was the real killer. Man that was the best vocal performance I've heard in years. This project has Grammy written all over it. Hopefully, record executives will take note and bless us with a collection of gospel and jazz standards performed by Miss Patti. Patti....you're the Original Diva."
2,ok set,"the truth is for me that there still hasn't been an album that has done Patti Labelle justice all the way to me.Vocally She is with the Best of the Best at any given time,but the Material alot of the time seems just kinda there&that is the case here.not enough depth to fully showcase Her great Instrument of a Voice."
2,Could Have Been Better,"""Timeless Journey"" is an okay effort. Certainly much better than her last effort, the ghastly ""When A Woman Loves"". But, there is still a lot of room for improvement. Over the years, Patti has just become too campy for me so I tend not to take her as seriously as a vocalist as I used to. ""Mm, Mm, Mm"" and ""A New Day"" are nice to listen to. The other cuts, however, are very run of the mill. It seems she's trying too hard to be contemporary but she's really not convincing. Again, while a step up from her last album, this one is for die-hard Labelle fans only."
5,GREAT,Product arrived on time AND I was concerned that it wasn't going to be new. It was new and a perfect match for my camera. Thank you!
1,wrong charger,"I ordered this charger when i bought the Olympus Stylus 9000. After i purchased the camera this charger appeared as the proper charger for this camera , so i bought it. Turns out it is the wrong charger for this camera. The battery will not fit in this charger. Why did it present this charger for the camera i purchased when it is the wrong one? Now the package is damaged and i cant return it. Dissapointed!"
3,ok toilet seat. cooler at a distance,how can I put this.. it looks cooler on the computer.. coins are cheap plastic and dollar billis really crappy looking.. but its a toilet seat so dont expect much.. 20 years ago they used real coins inthese seats.
1,Meh,"After the initial battery ran out in this product, I purchased a new one. About 5 minutes after I turned the unit on and it began flashing red, then went to a solid red light on the unit. Thinking it was simply a bad battery, I purchased another one. The same thing happened. Contacting support resulted in me being told that for $45 they would replace the unit.Save your money and buy something else."
1,battery is no good,"I have owned two different collars now (because I returned the first one) the second one had the same issue, the battery will flash red right out of the box to indicate its dead. I didnt know what to do for the second one so last night i had taken the battery out and replaced it with a CR1/3N battery that I order off ebay(6 pack for 11 dollars instead of the 10 dollars petsafe forces you into for one of their batteries)It seems to be fine now, I tested the battery that was in it and indeed indicated that the battery was very low. So the collar works fine if you want to do the work petsafe coudn't!!!"
1,"Save your money, don't buy this product!!","I received this product in the mail and it didn't work. The remote would not light up when I plugged it in....even after 24hrs.Amazon was wonderful and promptly sent me another in the mail and credited me for the return shipping on the faulty one.Well, after receiving my 2nd Little Dog Trainer in the mail, it's remote did not work as well. I really couldn't believe it!I called the company and they had me send the faulty product to them and covered the shipping. The man was very friendly and sent another Little Dog Trainer my way that week.It literally blew my mind when I received it and it too did not work!! I'd used my friends identical collar and that's why I wanted to purchase the product in the 1st place. Our friends collar worked great but I've had no such luck.Tomorrow I'm contacting the company and sending back the gear. I won't be having them send another my way and HIGHLY recommend people do not waste their time on this product."
2,not so good,"Inexpensive but for a reason. Ordered two pairs, one for a co-worker and one for myself. One came with the tip slightly damaged, Still cut well enough though. One pair started rusting after a month. Sadly they didn't work out as well as I had hoped. Good size, cut well and looked nice until the rust."
4,Sensational comeback!,"After the huge success of ""Encore une fois"" and ""Ecuador"", this one ""La Primavera"" seems to be the successor. I have listened to it and to me it is a very good song. It is worth every penny!"
4,nice shoe,"i like the look of these shoes, but they arent very comfortable! they are alittle big, so if you have a narrow foot, you may need to get something to help your foot not flip out of it! as for the comfort problem, dr. scholls for heels works pretty well!"
2,Quality is blown out of proportion,"I had read all the reviews and this seemed like the bed to go with. I liked the fact it came with its own built-in pump and it inflates very quickly. Here is the downside.According to the instructions, the bed can handle 600lbs. I had my sister and her family visit. Both my niece and nephew, whose combined weight is 100lbs. if they are soaking wet, slept on the air mattress. Much to my disappointment, the mattress lost about 30% of its air if not more. I understand air mattresses gradually, and I emphasize gradually, lose air. But this was a lot for the two little kids sleeping on this thing.I thought I had found a great buy. But I was disappointed with the product."
1,PIECE of JUNK,1st time using the bed and it won't stay inflated. Had to pump it up three time during the night or would of rolled right off the bed. One word.....JUNK!!!!
2,Leakage,"The air keeps going out from it.I tried to inflate it more than once and in few hours the air leaked. Even putting air before using it, I woke up in the middle of the night and had to turn the pump on. Not sure if there is a leak somewhere or just a bad product. On a postive note, the bed looks really nice and it is comfortable as long as it stays inflated."
1,Beware; it leaks air!,"This product is not worth the money. I only used it twice, and now it does not hold air for longer than a few hours. Waste of money. Buyer beware."
4,Great size but loses air,"The title says it all. Overall the size and weight was what I expected after reading other reviews. My guests slept great and thought the firmness was superior to past experiences. The mattress did lose air overnight and even when not slept on, it required additional air each night. The valve does not cap off like some other models, which may be the problem."
1,Don't Bother,This air mattress leaks constantly and needs to be reinflated in the middle of the night in order to avoid being completely flat by morning. I wish I'd used it sooner. Now outside of return window.
2,not good,I find that I have wasted my money on these items the air leaks out before I wake up. Iwant to send it back I did not open the second box because I can not beleive they charge so much and the items are worthless. I have company coming and now I have to spend more money for better air beds.
4,Great Bed!,"This bed was purchased because we really did not have time to shop for a real mattress and box spring. We took it up north for the summer to a lake house thinking that it would be used on weekends in the summer until we eventually had time to buy a real bed. After sleeping on it, I think that this might end up being our permanent bed-no need to buy another. It is just as comfortable as a expensive mattress. We are comparing this to our $2,000 Land and Sky king size mattress that we have in our home."
1,Not thrilled with item,It came quick enough but it does not stay inflated. We have to keep airing it up again. Doesn't even last through one night! I feel ripped off.
1,Hole in mattress from manufacture! China Quality!,"Purchased this mattress for guess staying at my house. Had guess at house when I opened the box and inflated this mattress. When I inflated the mattress it would not hold air because it had a hole in one of the seams on the top surface of the mattress where it had been folded by the manufacture. Doesn't Intex have any kind out Quality Control? Who, probably not in China where the mattress is made. Guess had to sleep on my couches.Amazon paid for return shipping are gave a 100% refund. 5-STARS for Amazon service!!!! One star (I HATE IT RATING) for Intex."
3,Does not have warranty.,"The bed worked very good for may be for 10 months. It was sturdy and good for everyday use. And I was using every day for for two months total.However, the big air cushion started forming on the top of the mattress. This was formed by joining two or more air cushion pocket on the top. The air started leaking also. There is no warranty on these products even for a year. This is my first air mattress, and may be I am expecting too much use and life out of it."
2,Didn't Last,"Purchased the Intex Supreme Air-Flow Queen Airbed Nylon Flocked with Built-in Electric Pump in January 2011. I used it for a couple of weeks and found it extremely comfortable. Used it again in July for a week, and most recently for a few days in September. It developed a leak that appears to be between the two mattresses, which I am unable to patch because of the location. It was great while it lasted, but it didn't last."
2,Develops Leaks,"At first this mattress is great. The included pump is very easy to use. However, after about a month of use, it develops holes in the stress points. These can be repaired but they continue to grow. If possible, choose another airmattress.Very comfortable though, when it is full and there are no leaks!"
4,Great value & comfort for price!!!!,So far so good. We use it when guests come to stay & they have said it is very comfortable. Seems to deflat a tad bit with two large adults but not an issue or concern...yet :) very easy set up!!!! A bit bulky to store but worth it all because of the price!!!
3,AIR BED,"CHECK THE WARRANY ON THIS ITEM DOES NOT HOLD AIR,IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND LEAK.VERY COMFORTABLE TO SLEEP ON .WISH IT WAS MADE A LITTLE BETTER."
2,After several weeks developed giant lump.,"Mine developed a giant lump but the replacement bed didn't. My only guess is perhaps if the bed is overfilled it will develop a lump, or maybe some are simply defective."
1,Comfort But Crappy Quality,"We purchased this airbed just over a year ago. In that time we have used it exactly 4 times for company to sleep on. Just like the major complaint that lots of other people have had, our's started looking like a pregnant whale with large bumps of air on the surface just last week. Something on the inside just lets go and you get these large pockets of air that raise up on the top of the bed, which makes it unusable. And of course, the bed has only a 90 day warranty. I don't think we even used it once in the first 90 days. This seems to be a product that is made to last about a year or so based on all of the similar complaints. I would not waste my money on another one."
2,Good when it lasts,"This mattress is great while it lasts; it isn't super wobbly, fitted sheets fit well, it doesn't look like something you'd send camping w/your kids, and it's tall enough that an older person can use it. However, it only lasts a couple months & then it must be replaced. After the first failure I ordered twice more thinking each was a fluke, that I'd gotten lemons. Now I've been through 3 and I doubt I got 3 lemons in a row. At around the two month mark the interior seams fail, the mattress bulges and begins losing air.I went w/Intex because, in the past, I had good luck w/them. Yes, some lasted longer than others, but in general, they lasted a reasonable amount of time. I also liked this mattress, while it worked it was the most comfortable guest mattress I'd had."
2,60 Day Bed - Just Say NO!,"Despite the warnings, I purchased this mattress for a family member going off to school We didn't unpack it for 3 months but when we did we were very happy with it. It was fine for about 60 days, then it started leaking... no apparent holes or tears... and now, it won't stay inflated at all. It's an expensive temporary sleep solution. We'd have been better off to just buy a low-end box springs and mattress or a futon and mattress, which is what we're doing now. It's too bad to have to dispose of this. I hate the idea of yet one more thing going to the landfill!"
3,Intex vs. Aerobed,"I purchased my first raised Queen airbed, by Aerobed, at CostCo 5 years ago. It was used as a primary, daily use bed. It was extremely comfortable, NEVER had leaks. Then after five years of daily use, the bed started to fail. The leak was not able to be located, so the bed was thrown out. After hours of Internet searching and comparison shopping, we chose the Intex Supreme Air-Flow Queen Airbed on Amazon.com as the replacement. The price was outstanding and the shipping was FREE. The bed was delivered BEFORE the expected delivery date. This bed is even more comfortable than the Aerobed, as it does not have the typical uneven air chamber surface to sleep on. It inflates quickly and efficiently. The only disappointment in this new Intex bed is that it does NOT inflate to the dimensions that it touts on the box and in the advertisement. This Queen bed is a full 4 inches shorter AND 4 inches narrower than the Aerobed Queen. Queen fitted sheets are rather loose now."
3,Raise Bed,"Its okay, just a bit bulky. I would choose a smaller bed if i had to again. Its very difficult to put back into the bag it came with once you deflate. I would have prefer if the bag was a bigger(bag you store the bed in). All in all, its a good product, if you are never going to need to deflate it and if you have a pretty large area. O! not leaving out the weight. its pretty heavy when deflated. I need a 18 weeler to haul this thing."
1,Good Temporarily,This Bed is good for a few weeks. After that the air starts to slowly drain. It comes with a small patch but the hole i have must be under the padding because when i sit on it. it sounds like it leaks in various places.
1,cat's didn't even give it a second look,"I think this toy is just too big to interest cats (I have six, and they are all young adults, 1-1/2 to 4 years old). It looks & sounds like it would be fun, but when I put it down and tried to get them interested, not one of them (even the youngest, who's VERY playful) gave it a second glance.I would have returned it but the return shipping would be half the cost of the toy itself, so I just kept it. May give to one of my friends with cats and see if theirs has any interest...Would not recommend the product."
4,a fall through the ground,"If you are interesting in Johns solosmaterial because you have heard him in RHCP, this NOT the ablum for you!!! I'd recommend ""To Record Only Water for Ten Days"". ""Smile..."" represents the depths of a long downhill battle with addiction. There are some incredibly beautiful moments on it. There are others that most people would classify unlistenable. I appreciate the entire piece of work. No it's not easy on the ears, yes it invokes painful emotions. Isn't that the point of some art? It can't all be roses. And thanks to a strong will John is better than ever with his latest release! All of this is a moot point since John has pulled this album from production as he was not proud of all of it. He recognized that some of the work was made to fund his habit and that it was not a benevolent reason for creating art and would not create pure emotions in listeners."
5,More Incredibleness,Insanely beautiful and beautifully insane. Everyone should be required to listen to this.
5,What are you talking about?,"A man with to much money and time on his hands! If you say that you know nothing about music or what makes a good record. You are probably one of those guys who thinks he's so sophisticated and can say whatever he wants but until you make an amazing record like this one you should just shutup. This record is amazing tracks like ""A Fall Through the Ground"", ""Height Down"" with the late River Pheonix, and of course "" Smile From the Streets You Hold"". Very good record. Dont listen to what anyone else says."
1,Worst excuse for vocals this side of Yoko Ono,This albumn contains some very average guitar work and is marred by some terrible vocals. I was expecting a lot more considering this guys brilliant work with the Peppers. Very disappointing.
4,Great Product,"This is a very well made four loaf pan, but beware of sharp edges. I purchased this for my daughter so that she could make breads for a church bake sale. It worked out great especially since it cuts the baking time down considerably."
2,do not recommend,"Every year for the holidays I make breads for gifts. I saw this online and it looked like it would work for me. The pan is very heavy, has sharp edges and is difficult to clean. It is also very clumsy to use. I would not recommend this product. It's almost easier to buy individual bread pans."
5,The best gate ever,"Although i have no kids, I do have dogs and needed a gate that could stand some abuse and be easy to use as well. Of all the gates I have tried over the years, this is the one to get. Easy to set up, easy to move and sturdy as well. This is a well made, well thought out product and it's about time. Order additional mounts and you can move this gate to several areas within a few minutes and feel secure. Besides all that it is attractive and will fit any decor. Plus replacement parts as well as the additional mounts are available from the mfg. as well, so if you need to add or replace there is support behind you."
