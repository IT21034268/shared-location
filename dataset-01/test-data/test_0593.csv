3,"Umm, definitely different...","I enjoyed just about all of this album, with the exception of the French rap track. That's one music genre wish Old Gordy wouldn't dabble in. But, you still gotta love the guy--he's still got it, after all these years."
5,Brand New Sting!,"In all honesty, I really think Sting is getting better. This album prooves this. 'Brand New Day' has to be, musically as well as lyrically his best since 'The Soul Cages'. Before you yell at me, yes 'Ten Summoners Tales' was just as good. Sting has a go at something different here and does a brilliant job. Each track has a tale to tell and the realism of these tales is created through the catchy and rather pleasant music in each. Once you are done listening to this you will be absolutely glad you bought this as I promise you will want to listen to it again and again! The tracks that will really get your attention are 'Thousand Years', 'Desert Rose', 'After The Rain Has Fallen'(the ultimate feel-good song) and 'Brand New Day'(another cool feel-good tune)One more thing - try and get the version with 'The End Of The Game' on it and not 'Prelude to the end of the Game' (a 20 second intro). This six minute plus track is a prime example of Stings talent. An absolute brilliant album!!!"
4,"Diverse, but yet...","Being a latin music/world music fan, enjoyed very much a lot of the diversity on this cd. That is probably the only reason why I bought it. The songs w/ arabic and french are very neat, and it shows his depth and desire to reach different limits. To be perfectly honest, I do not know anythign about STING, yes may that be so, I did find a few track that I deeply enjoy, and think high of. The country track is a complete loser, and a few others where I just wonder where the lyrics are coming from. Yes, the lyrics, (all created by him, I suppose) are quite odd, but the few tracks, i do like, agreeing with most other revieers, Brand New Day, Desert Rose, and a few others are very much worth it. They are creative, diverse, new, and just a piece of art. worthy, totally... if you never thought about Sting, check out this cd, like I did."
1,I miss the good ol' Sting,"I am a great fan of Sting. He has inspired me ever since I became familiar with his work. I always used to close my eyes and see the castles, fields and heroes he used to sing about. That is why I was very disappointed with Sting's former album and VERY disappointed with Sting's current new album: Brand New Day. It seems, that Sting is going on ""fishing trips"" for new sounds and new types of music, instead of focusing on his own, unique style, the one he is loved and appreciated for. He is doing a terrible job - I come from Israel, where we are exposed to authentic Arabic fine music. That is why, to my ears, Sting's attempts to sound more ""ethnic"" are pathetic. This whole album is an aimless mixture of sounds, and Sting, as a great artist, gets lost inside. I can only hope that this album was made for pure fun and that soon we will get to hear Sting's real beautiful mellow Celtic-like tunes."
4,Hard to believe all these styles are on the same album.,"It's a great album. My personal favorite is Ten Tales(that's my 5 star pick) but this one is excellent too. Tracks 1 & 2 are fantastic. Fill Her Up (track 8) is ...interesting. If you are a die hard Sting fan you'll love the album. Even if you are a crude, crass, and barbaric American (like me). Bring on the tour!"
5,one of the most intelligent artists of our time,"sting doesn't write his msuic for the pop masses - he writes to empty his soul. the fact that he spotlights and often stands in the background of various ""unknown"" european artists is commendable. i enjoy the complicated( and sometimes simple) rhythms he employs in his music. thank god it doens't sound just like everything else that hits the airwaves. i for one don't want to hear this album on the radio everyday - i think it would demean it's very being."
2,Such a disappointment...,"Sting, honey, you're not Peter Gabriel. You're not Lyle Lovett either. There's about three good songs here, everything else is junk. I spent the entire day listening to old Police CDs and Sting's other solo albums to get the bad taste out. When Sting is good, he's very good - but usually he hangs these observations on a hook that's identifiable. Whereas Sting used to rant - brilliantly - about life's minutiae in songs like Landlord (grousing about the jerk who owns his building) and Man in a Suitcase (about travelling non-stop), now he has empty songs about empty themes. Sting, honey, was Perfect Love...Gone Wrong really necessary? The track listing is inaccurate, by the way -""Prelude"" runs just 19 seconds and is listed as track 7. Sooo disappointed, and I'm the biggest Sting fan in my clique."
3,Not Sting at his best... but still Sting...,"I am a Sting lover and student. I have always bought his discs the day they came out, this one being no exception. Reading the review here on Amazon as I ordered the disc put me on my defensive before I even received it in the mail. I am a professional musician/songwriter/performer. It is hard if not impossible to explain how difficult it is to outdo previous work on a consistent basis, particularly when your work is in the arena of Sting's. A talented, articulate guy like Sting isn't gonna keep giving us the ""Roxannes'"" folks. Been there, done that, time to challenge the barriers and try some new methods of songwriting.In short, if you are a Sting fan, you will find enough qualities in this album to keep you in his corner. If you're not a Sting fan, you'll be weeded out. We don't need you anyway."
4,It Was Good If You Liked Sting's Last Album,"This album from Sting was a fine effort, like the other two albums I have of his. This album, in fact, sounds like Mercury Falling Part II to me, but then again that may just be a personal opinion of mine.As far as the songs go, they are wide ranging, from the country of ""Fill Her Up"" to the world-beat sound of ""Desert Rose"" (a fine track)and to the rousing jazzy pop of the title track. I also enjoyed ""Perfect Love...Gone Wrong,"" but perhaps that was due to my twisted sense of humor. I was a little disappointed that ""The End of the Game"" was not in its entirety in the album, in fact, the nineteen seconds of the prelude probably do not do it justice.In short, if you liked Sting's last album and are interested in a mellow evening of well-crafted music, buy this album, but if you are looking for music to feel really pumped and frantic about, you might want to think about something more like Rage Against the Machine."
3,A mix of good and gone too far,"Overall a little disappointing...Sting uses a lot of recycled melodies and trite lyrics. ""Perfect Love"" really overdoes it with doggy references, ""Tomorrow We'll See"" just doesn't work (Sting as a prostitute?!?), and ""Fill Her Up"" is lyrically confused. There is some redemption in ""Thousand Years,"" which is more along the lines of what we've come to expect from Sting. I applaud the integration of rai, harmonica, and new styles. Sting isn't afraid to try new things. In this case he may have tried to do to much at once, and the album take patience to get through. ""Ghost Story"" is lyrically beautiful but musically redundant and down-right hard to get through before the end finally offers a change to the constant sound of poetry being read badly. ""Brand New Day"" is the track that seems to be closest to what Sting was reaching for - an integration of old and new Sting with good lyrics, pleasing beats and melodies, and well-layered rhythms. Worth buying, but not a must-have."
2,Huge Sting fan hugely disappointed,"Man, what a disappointment. I've been listening to Sting since I was in HS when the Police got started and love just about everything he's done. Until now. What is this album about? There's no common thread like in his previous albums, and almost every song has an analog from an older album. A tune in 9/8 that's hard to count, a country tune (this time a really bad one), a slow groove laden ballad that doesn't live up to Fields of Gold, etc.And this, coming after a killer Behind the Music on VH1. AAAAARRRRRGGGGGGGHHHHH!"
4,Sing Does It Again,"Sting continues is experiments in fusion, this time with electronica and hip-hop. It is easy to get hung up on the new sound, but if you just for a minute forget about the electronic sound effects in the background, this album will not seem like such a great departure from Mercury Falling and Ten Summoner's Tales. More to the point, there are three or four great songs on the album. The rest are, well, experiments. Of the later kind Fill Her Up stands out. It begins as a country song, then goes into mock-gospel, then there is the hint of a rock guitar solo, and it ends with a jazz instrumental. In the end, songs like A Thousand Years, Desert Rose, and Brand New Day make it worth the 15 bucks."
2,save your money,"i will always be a great sting fan, but i sensed him slipping into the morass three CDS ago, and now he's totally stuck. after the 1st two tracks, this CD is a loser. seems to me he was at his best when inspired by tragedy, now i think he's only fueled by cash. don't buy it. i made the mistake for you. borrow someone else's and listen for yourself, if you must. for the first time. i won't be buying his CDs again unless he strips himself of the foolishness and gets back to the stuff that ...nothing like the sun and soul cages were made of. he's gotten too self-indulgent and it shows here."
2,Every one strikes out once in a while!,"There is no BIGGER Sting fan than me. If I there is any artist who could put out great albums every single time, it's Sting. Let's face it - Every album since the Police has been amazing, including the Soul Cages which was not exactly commercially oriented or the best selling album. This album, however, is just blah. The music is all over the place and nothing sticks out. I think this is Sting's ""Emotional Rescue""! Hopefully he will be back up to par for the next one. Also there are only 9 songs on this album, not ten. That was disappointing because I always thought Sting had a lot of integrity. Even Alanis Morrisette gave us an extra song on ""Jagged Little Pill""!"
3,Another Critical Review - A few True Gems but....,"As many others, I have been a great fan of Sting's since forever. A fan of his diversity, style and consistency of quality. While this CD does contain several great songs (""Thousand Years"",""Fill Her Up"" and ""Ghost Stoy"") and one of his best Singles ever - (""Brand New Day""), much of the album is pedestrian. Facile lyrics about streetwalkers don't cut it for a songwriter as talented as Sting. On past albums and especially on Mercury Falling, one felt that the songwriter was really going beyond the surface and penetrating the emotions of the song's characters. But this only happens on a few tracks here. The fact that this disk has a few great songs makes it worth the purchase, (the chorus alone of BND is amazing songwriting, impecable phrasing that seems so simple yet only few gifted songwriters could pull off so gracefully) It is difficult to recommend a single Sting CD, but MERCURY FALLING remains consistently the best of his later offerings."
2,Boring New Day,"Houston, we have a problem. It would appear that our former hero, Sting, has become a lazy songwriter with nothing really new to say. Is the man really one step away from Vegas? Based on the evidence heard on this album, the answer is, sadly, yes. Cheesy lyrical imagery and warmed-over melodies abound. Don't get me wrong, the soundscapes are still gorgeous-just check out the delicate melancholy of A Thousand Years or the middle-eastern overtones of Desert Rose. It's just that Sting can't be bothered to write good songs anymore-it's not like he's got anything to prove, right? And then there is the perfection of the musicianship. Listening to the Brand New Day, I found myself wishing someone would miss a beat or skip a note. Gordon Sumner, if you're still alive, give us a sign."
2,YAWN!!,Sting has said that he wrote this album differently. He wrote the music first...and as always the music and muscianship is first rate. The stilted lyrics and lazy vocal performace sink this one like a stone.
4,be sting!,"Sting continues to create great melodies with little ditties about life's little delimmas: such as games ex-lovers play in ""big lie, small world""...to attempting to erase a love with time in ""a thousand days"". Country western doesn't escape Sting's musical genius either. He always pushes his boundries with experimentation ..do not expect him to put out carbon copy music...expect to be stung by his masterful versatility fusing jazz, (you can hear some Miles Davis techniques in his backup rhythums) rhythum and blues into his music..he is getting better with age!"
3,Wishing for another 10 summoner's tales........,"Having heard the CD for a couple times, my conclusion is that Sting might be running out of things to say. No doubt ""Desert Rose"", ""Brand New Day"" and ""A Thousand Years"" are excellent tracks but where is the sense of direction which was so evident in Ten Summoner's Tales ? I will still be a Sting fan but this album will not win any new fans. By the way, why oh why is the track ""End of the Game"" is only available on the the UK import single which costs 75% of the whole album (because it has to be imported from UK to Malaysia) ??!! Talk about milking us fans out dry."
4,"Great insight into the past, giving hope for the future","Truly spiritual Sting fans will get this one. He has incredible vision for what a new millennium holds for those who want love because he understands the evil force that gripped the 20th century full of lust and hate. In the end, the good guys will win the century, and Sting knows it. (America needs to hear ""End of the Game"".) As a Sting fan, I say listen with a new heart and open yourselves to love. The album will be more compelling."
5,ABSOLUTELY SPLENDID!,"Words can't describe how incredibly magical this album is!! I just saw STING live in concert at the Flint Center in Cupertino, California and I was transported. During the 2 hours, i was under a spell. I still have not recovered. His music continues to amaze me! It has a great fusion of sounds and the the lyrics are great stories that I love to get into. Simply magical! See for yourself..get it!"
4,"Good, but not the best...","I would say this is vintage Sting, in that, like all other Sting albums, it is quite different than those that came before it. I don't think Brand New Day has the poetic lyrics of Nothing Like the Sun or the great variety of style in Mercury Falling, but I am pleased with Sting's newest endeavor. I wasn't too impressed the first time I listened to this, but I have played it twice more, and I have enjoyed it more each time, so be patient! I do have to say that this album lacks the almost scary clarity of Sting's voice (which is the best part, in my humble opinon) -- too often the vocals are lost within the music."
5,Great album,"After a hiatus of over 3 years, Sting turns out another collection of songs colored by his very distinctive talent (and penchant for odd time signatures). There are some superbly written and lavishly produced tracks on this album. The upbeat title track is just one, but others to look for include the two jewels Ghost Story and A Thousand Years, the breathtaking Desert Rose, and the catchy After The Rain Has Fallen. Highly recommended."
3,There's RAP in this CD! Sacrilegious!!,"I have high standards for Sting because he is in a class all his own. This CD moves him out of the style of music that he so wonderfully mastered all these past years; in fact, there's rapping in one of the tracks! Of all the genres of music, it is clear that contemporary rap is the most lamest, no-talent-required type of music out there--and you'll find it in track five, Perfect Love...Gone Wrong."
2,been here before,there was a time when a new sting album was something special well that's been a long long long time ago.not since nothing like the sun or maybe the hits has sting done a worthy album for me.i like the cut with stevie wonder and i'm glad bradford is back playing with him again but the music and writting and arrangements i've heard all before and better.he has lost his edge for me.and where was james taylor?
5,Exact Replacement,First one arrived DOA. I called the seller and they immediately shipped a replacement. Product came faster than promised and fit into mixer without any problems. I would recommend this for anyone that is having speed control issues with their kitchen aid mixer.
2,Osprey does it better !,"..another weak effort from the French - Hartman's K-4 indeed - nobody knows what it looked like - least of all these French authors - too many garish colours, banana-shaped fuselage profile drawings and old myths repeated.."
4,Mayday-,"This CD is truely for fans of blue eyed soul. Bill struts his stuff on the Hammond B3, the guitar, and especially his outstanding voice. Not only does this cd present Bill Champlin the musician, but also Bill Champlin the song writer. It was so nice to finally hear him sing after the Love is gone. Southern Serenade (duet w/ Tamara Champlin) has a wonderful gospel feel to it. Champlin's version of Quincy Jones In the Heat of The Night, blew my mind away. Bill has mastered the art of the B3 organ and this track prooves it. I recommend this CD to true Champlin fans."
3,This is a Kindle book review,"Please be aware that this is strictly a kindle book review. The Tao Te Ching needs no further comment. The translation here is very nice and is quite similar to others I have read. What wasn't made clear (though in retrospect it can be surmised), is that this is not the deluxe edition on Kindle. In fact it contains no pictures, no caligraphy, and definitely no Mandarin edition. I gave it three stars because if you are looking for a poetic rendition that has a nice flow and clarity then you will enjoy it. But if, like myself, you have read various editions (some good, some not so much) then without the missing material it is really not worth your money. Go and find the book."
2,KODOKAN JUDO is still more comprehensive!,"I suggest buying KODOKAN JUDO, by the Founder of Judo. Every club has its own rank requirements, usually based on officially recongnized judo techniques. The book by Kano is the official description of most of these techniques! Of course, judo books are most helpful for someone who has attended some sort of instruction! If you have not had instruction, I suggest asking your instructor to choose techniques for you to learn and then you can cross reference that teaching with the book."
2,Inconsistent quality,"When I first started ordering this product on Amazon I received damaged cans - every single can on the wrapped pallet of twelve cans was dented so I know it didn't happen during shipping. The food was also dry so I stopped ordering the product after receiving two shipments of poor quality product. After getting reminder notices to reorder I decided to give it another try a few months later. The quality was excellent and the food was really moist and fresh - perfect, my cats loved it! After receiving about four good quality product shipments, the fifth one that I currently received is back to being dry and chunky instead of moist and creamy and my cats won't eat it. How can the product be that inconsistent??? Very disappointed."
3,Packaging problem,"My rating is based on the condition of the product when I recieved it. Of the case of 12 cans I had ordered, 4 of them had serious dents. I sent an email about the packaging but received no response. I would give the product itself at least a 4 rating."
1,no go,"All five ferals, said no. Cat foods today, even the dry are too full of fruits and vegetables. Mine don't like carrots, peas or apples."
5,Wellness Chicken Canned Cat Food,Wellness Minced Chicken Canned Cat Food is a favorite of my eight cats. They all love the flavor and I like the high quality ingredients.
1,Poor Packaging,"First let me say that the product itself is excellent and I have no problems with it. This review is mainly about Amazon's idea of proper packaging. I ordered this with super saver shipping and it will be the last time. from now on I will order from another vendor and pay for shipping.When I received the package it was stained and 3 cans had been so severely damaged that they were leaking, 2 others were questionable and 7 others were severely dented but safe to use( I work in a canning facility so I know how to test vacuum in cans). The product was packaged with no padding at all in a box that was a good deal larger than the item. I saved no money at all on free shipping as I had to discard 5 cans of an already expensive cat food."
5,Making Sure We Get All Nine Lives,We switched our elderly kitty to this product after my vet suggested that higher quality food can help promote better health. I wasn't sold on the idea but we gave it a try and I'm so glad we did. Since switching to Wellness my cat throws up much less and seems to have more energy not to mention the fact that she LOVES this food!
5,Our 2 Kittens Love It,Our 2 kittens who are now 5 months old love Wellness Canned Kitten Food. They lick their dishes clean. And I feel very good giving them a healthy food to eat.I've been so happy with the canned food orders I've placed with Petco. Have had trouble with orders coming from other companies arriving dented. Petco packages them very well and I have not received one dented can yet. Fast shipping too.
2,Better than most canned food but still BAD,"I have a cat who had serious intestinal issues. I needed a canned food that was grain free and also I need a protein that was not chicken - I had to start my cat on a novel protein. I bought this on the recommendation of a veterinarian (L. Pierson) on her web site, for so called ""acceptable"" canned food, because it is grain free. However if you read the ingredients list, it contains other ingredients that the same veterinarian says are allergenic to cats (e.g. carageenan). Also, even though its name claims it is ""Turkey"", (the turkey was supposed to be the novel protein for me) the ingredients list lists chicken and chicken parts as its 2nd, 3rd and 4th ingredients. It also has the same type of thickeners, fillers, and ""flavoring"" that all the other run of the mill canned pet food has.I originally gave this a 3 star rating (because it doesn't contain grains), but as I typed my review I was reminded of the deception and it made me change it to a 2 star."
4,5 out of 5 Love the Food,"My cat herd (5) love Wellness canned food, especially the turkey mix. Cat ages range from 3 to l0 and all have thrived on this food. I supplement their diets with Wellness dry food, but the canned is by far their favorite."
5,Delicious (I Know!),"My cats ADORE this cat food, they cannot eat it quick enough. And, I hate to admit it, but the pleasant smell and lack of by-products tickled my curious side as well. I have eaten this cat food on more than one occasion, and it is actually pretty good. I find myself nibbling whenever I run out of people food or just feel like sharing a meal with my cats. Tres bien!"
2,Most of the Cans Were Dented,"I've been ordering a lot of these. Many of these go directly to my daughter's house. This is to let people know that most of the cans in these packages are DENTED. In the beginning I had thought it was an occasional can or two but I see in the last shipment that all of the cans were dented. It was just a matter of degree. However, when I purchased these at the retail store, none were dented. I think this is a good enough reason for me to think twice about buying these via Amazon in the future. I don't believe the price difference is all that much. I would hate for my cats to get botulism from the poor quality of the cans."
5,Best concordance I own!!!,"I own this concordance as well as strong's and young's. This one is by far the most informative, easy to use, and gets the most use in my house-hold. I have not found a Lexicon/concordance that is more insightful than this one (which doesn't mean one doesn't exist). The definitions in this concordance are clear, open up your understanding to God's word, and I actually find it easier to use than Strong's and Young's (it is designed to go alphabetical by the english word, and then you find the greek words that are used in translation with the verses under the english word). This book is truly more informative than anything else I've seen. For me this is a MUST OWN!!! You won't be disappointed by this book."
2,Technical playing,"The Emerson's really know how to play their instruments. If they could focus on the music instead of how fabulously they scrape their fiddles, they might be more worth listening to. I found the Quintet recording to be atrociously un-musical, a typical superstar catastrophe that doesn't serve the music at all."
2,Its ok...but a lot of faults,I bought it... so surprised to see it a bit expensive here! ... I returned it since I found a lot of features are broken. Such as the ones mentioned in the previous review.
1,HDTV HIGHLY OVERRATED,HDTV IS A RIP AND FOR 800 PLUS MY CAR HAS A BETTER TV IN IT AND FOR THE MONEY ID RATHER GO ON A CRUISE AND TELL ALL HDTV COUCH POTATOES TO GET UP AND SPEND WISELY OR BUY A DELL....
2,NOT WHAT I REMEMBER,"I used to love this game, not as much fun as i remember worth 10 bucks but no more. they do not have this on WII shop ."
3,Where is Camille??,I too bought this DVD because of Camille and Colin Firth. I have watched a couple of the films and will keep the DVD but I would like to know how come Camille is written on one of the disc but is not actually on the DVD can someone provide an explanation???
4,short game,this game is very short . i played it its kind of good and it is very easy to control! its good for kids 4/8 because it can get borring when you pass it and then start it again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,OK game,"this game has many complex levels of play, but the direction booklet is tres' confusing. But anyway you can't save and I find that very dissapointing."
1,IT WAS BAD,"I'm 12 and I got it when I was 10 and still to this day I can't get pass ANYTHING!! It is way to hard. You can't get pass anything. Every time you try you just end up dieing. If you just like doing the same thing over and over again then its for you, but if you like to get to the next leavle or smothing then its not even worth buying. The grapics arn't even that great. I would give it a 1/2 rating if I could maby even lower. It should at least be for a 11 year old or older not no 6 year old and younger."
3,Animaniacs r coo!,"I luv the animaniacs, but one of the levels I run into in this game is like impossible to get passed cuz theres thins thing in the way, so it like gets so boring to play it over and over. So it really isn't that great of a game."
1,I arrive me HP Pavilion dv6215us,I arrive me HP Pavilion dv6215usI requested Pavilion dv6140usI am not happy
1,Return to Sender,"Do not waste your money on this product. Although it has received great reviews in mainstream Mac journals and is a great idea in theory, in practice it will fragment your hard drive terribly. Optimization programs will choke in trying to defragment a ""Rewound"" drive."
4,this book was okay,"when a group of children are kidnapped, xena and gabrielle joinin the search to find them. they are joined by attlanta, who isa goddess who cannot be defeated. but the enemies that have thechildren have other ideals for the 2 fierecest women known inancient greece. a decent read for all xena fans."
4,"Good guide for those interested in Mustang upgrades, but...","This book is basically a republishing of articles from Muscle Mustangs & Fast Fords Magazine. But that is pretty much the only negative thing about it. If you haven't had a subscription, or you don't categorize and bookmark issues you do have, this is a good thing to have, especially, if like me, you haven't worked on a lot of cars. In introductions to chapters, it adds information that may have been left out of articles, which I found answered questions I had. It makes a good addition to the Haynes manual, which just covers stock items. I find it good reading even for those items I have no plan to upgrade. More pictures of the projects and references to chapters (or information on) other projects on the same vehicle would have made this a five star rating."
4,Could not stop reading...,"..even though I knew the outcome from reading the captions for the photos in the middle of the book..I was mesmerized by the cruelty of this murderer. To murder one's wife , who was ""slow"" (mentally retarded) in such a horrific way (shot three times and then a spear plunged through her!!) and to murder her mother at the same time in the same way!...and all for insurance money! The murderer was described later as having a ""brilliant mind""...I don't get it..then why was he making just $6.00 an hour in a menial job?? All of the people in this book sounded like ""po' white trash to me..book takes place in Alabama. One has to admire the tenacity of the investigators over the years, esp. the female one, who would not let go until justice was done.The writing was sufficient for the material..I have already ordered Sheila Johnson's other book on true murder."
2,Artic Ski Bib,"Undersized (XXL=XL) and cheaply made. Seam blew out while trying on. You get what you pay for, and in this case even less."
4,why?,"why are there no special features at all? theres like a puzzle on the 3rd disk case and thats it! its a great show and probably one of its best seasons, but come on. no commentary? no anamatics? no making of? nothing! after the third season dvd they just gave up on special features. wwwhhhhyyyyy!?!?!i would say more about this season but the episode list speaks for its self, its fan-friggin-tastic"
5,VERY FUNNY!,"My husband and I absolutely love this show! Season 6 is very funny.Not too crazy about season 11 that is on TV now though. Not nearly as funny or ""raw."" Started seeing a slight subtle change in the characters during season 10. Maybe new writers? Also graphics are too clean on the current seasons. I don't know. Not quite the same. Sometimes the lastest technology isn't always the best. I have seen many shows change for the worse that way. Oh well. Going crazy trying to find out when season 7 and 8 are coming out. Does anyone know? I can't find anything. There are sooo many people waiting for them. Don't they know that?? Anyway, buy season 6...you won't be dissapointed!"
2,The movie is better,"THe game is awful. bad graphics, can't save your game. Don't waste your money!! Buy something for PS2!!"
5,Good read,"I always enjoy the Darkover books - this one was no exception.Good story, consistent with the other books and short stories.Made me wish I could go there..."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY!,"This printer is like a boat. I bought it because it was cheap and did what I needed it to. Little did I know they get you on the ink cartridges...they CAN NOT be refilled and are custom made by Brother. The machine self cleans constantly (this uses ink) and once you run out of a color, say magenta for example, you CAN'T print anything until you replace that empty cartridge. So, no black and white prints. This printer is very expensive to operate given the necessary ink purchases. I recommend you spend a few extra dollars on something that has less of an ink cost.Justin T. BranekyBraneky Pest Prevention, Inc.Orlando/Geneva Florida"
1,"Dead after three years, four months","After only three years and four months of light household use the printer no longer prints in black. After reinstalling software, updating firmware,switching cartridges, and cleaning print heads, I believe I have a clogged print head. Since this machine will not print in black without a black cartridge, my full color cartridges are useless. (Most printers will blend colors to print in black when the black cartridge is empty). This is my last Brother purchase. I guess I can use it as a standalone outgoing fax machine and scanner and large phone. Off to buy a new printer. Probably an HP."
3,brother 3-1,"ok for my purpose, but clarity not the best. ink hard to find unless u buy it from online (ie. amazon)"
5,"A copy ""finally""","I originally gave a bad review to this book because of the lack of availability, and the crass over pricing of copies in the Amazon Marketplace and Ebay. This was not exactly fair, but I wondered why the publishers let this go on. With that out of the way.As an artist I found Midori's book on this subject one of the best. Well exectuted, with line illustration, and the occational color plates between chapters. I hope this book does stay available because it is worth it."
3,"Fabulous A-Side, awful b-sides","It really pains me to give such a fantastic band three stars. The song ""Blue Orchid"" is just great. It's guitars and fascinating lyrics are captivating. But the b-sides could have been done better.""Who's A Big Baby"" is appaling. When I bought the single (before the album came out), I was kinda afraid that the album might not be that good. Thankfully, the album was great, but this song is really terrible.""Though I Hear You Calling"" is only OK. It's a hell of a lot better than Who's A Big Baby. It has an interesting riff, and was a relief after Who's A Big Baby.The live version of ""You've Got Her In Your Pocket"" is great.Overall, this is not worth your money. Spend your money on the singles that came afterwards, ""My Doorbell"" and ""The Denial Twist"". Those singles are excellent, but not Blue Orchid."
3,Great Gore,"I am giving this movie three stars for the great gore and make up effects. I really like some of the scenery used in the movie too. However, this movie never really goes anywhere. Although they were trying to go for a good effect with the camera work- it just gets plain annoying after awhile and is overdone. The acting is mediocre at best. It's a fun watch though."
4,GOOD MOVIE BUT LEFT YOU HANGING AT THE END OF THE MOVIE,I AM A ZOMBIE MOVIE FAN... THIS MOVIE WAS GOOD BUT THE ONLY THING I DID NOT LIKE ABOUT IT IS THE ENDING. IT LEAVES YOU GUESSING WHAT HAPPENS NEXT. I AM TRYING TO FIND THE PART TWO OR THE CONTINUING FOR THIS MOVIE BUT NO LUCK. I HOPE THE OTHER PART OF THIS MOVIE IS RELEASED SOON SO I CAN FINISH WATCHING IT. I DO NOT WANT TO BE LEFT HANGING AND GUESSING WHAT HAPPENS NEXT.
1,Its not even a whole movie,"Basically its an hour and fifteen minutes of gore, up to and including a zombie ripping an unborn child out of a pregnant woman's chest and eating it. The real story begins about ten minutes before the movie ends, and then you are greeted with the all-too-disappointing ""To be continued..."" screen."
1,EPILEPTICS BEWARE!!!!,"WHAT A COMPLETE PIECE OF UTTER GARBAGE!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS---LOW BUDGET NOTWITHSTANDING, THIS IS A SLOPPY, PATHETICALLY ACTED AND DIRECTED CRAPFEST!! DO NOT LET THE ADMITTEDLY COOL COVER ART FOOL YOU---THE EDITING STYLE IS HORRIBLE, THE 'SCARES' WAY TOO AMATEURISH AND UNINSPIRED, AND THE ""TO BE CONTINUED....."" ENDING A TRUE INSULT!! EAT YOUR OWN FOOT FIRST--YOU'LL ENJOY IT MORE!!"
1,One of the worst I've ever seen,"I've watched a lot of low-budget zombie films, and this is truly one of the worst. It was more a loosely connected montage of gory set pieces than a fully realized film with an actual story, and when the story does seem to finally kick in, the movie pulls the rug out from under the viewer's feet. Absolutely terrible."
2,Silly gore-monger,"Automaton Transfusion is a rather mindless gore-fest. This disappointing movie features a pretty weak plot and no theme to speak of. The special effects are perhaps its one redeeming feature. Standout scenes include a living son versus undead dad scenario, in which the undead dad gets a shard through the brain, and a gal getting her face torn off. This movie has surprisingly very little in common with the films of George Romero, which include compelling themes and interesting characters. My opinion of this film: gore for the sake of gore."
1,I own the movie and could not finish it.,"First of all I LOVE zombie movies. This movie sucks out loud, I own the movie and it sucked so bad that I watch half of the movie and never finished it. If you are looking for a good zombie movie then get dawn of the dead or land of the dead."
1,Stay Away!!!!,"I got this movie from the bargin bin at Wal-Mart for $10. Boy, I really want my money back! This is the worst movie that I have ever seen. Low budget to say the least. They didn't even have enough money to finished the movie. The everything about this movie stinks. The acting, directing, script, everything. If you see this in the stores then staying away is the best advice I can give."
2,Another same old WWE release that leaves you disapointed,"released in 2008... yet only shows his career up to his match against Edge and Cena...2006, no continuation onto the DX reunion era, and so on..And it's the same old, 2 minute intro, match, two minute intro, match... the fans want the full story, not a few career highlight matches, hell, he talks about the DX days for 1 minute before going onto the next move in his career, no in depth interviews, just the same old boring things you've heard before.save your money and wait for them to release the next 100 versions of a triple h story over the next 10 years."
3,Wish I had read it when it was new,"While the story line carried me along pretty well, and continued the well-defined and inviting Scarpetta character, I found it hard to get past the (now) anachronistic lack of technology she could have used, both scientifically and in communications. I just couldn't passed that or view it as ""Historical""."
4,Good book,We like Patricia Cornwell books. They are always exciting and interesting. Kay Scarpetta is a great character as well as her counterparts.
1,A horrible read !!!,"I bought this paperback at an airport in Eastern Europe anticipating a long flight back to the States. Pat Cornwell's book made the flight seem like an eternity. One wonders who loads these airport book shelves anyways ? The bad writers society of America !!! What an odd export to new and emerging countries. Every once in a while reading a really bad book is an exorcism for the soul; this plot is implausible and rushed, the characters wafer thin, the heroine a snotty, conflicted, self-absorbed, manhating know-it-all who is traveling here and there booking those frequent flyer miles on the government payroll. Cornwell has no sense of story flow, her sentences are deadweight. Lastly, she simply can't write."
1,Not a lot to say........,poo-pooNot much else to say except that it's a tragic waste of paper... I couldn't get past the first few chapters and I tried on several occasions.
2,Graves of Bodies,"Cornwell didn't keep you guessing long in this one. After you knew the murderer it took all of the suspense away. This is not one of Cornwall's best stories. What about Marino and some of the others? Lucy has her problems and Scarpetta must be the good Aunt. I was disappointed in ""The Body Farm."" By Ruth Thompson author of ""Natchez Above The River"""
2,Not One Of Cornwell's Best Efforts,"I must admit that I do like to read novels by Cornwell, but this one just lost me about mid-way through it. I tried to continue to no avail. Maybe the next one will be better"
2,Could have been better,"""Body Farm"" is definitely not one of Cornwell's best. I liked the story line, but could do w/o the ""romance"" & her obnoxious niece Lucy. Also, I was able to figure out ""who done it"" way to easily.I think this bk. had good possibilities, however it just seemed to fizzle."
4,"Yeah, Scarpetta!","I've read all of the Scarpetta books to date, and loved them all. This particular book was quite interesting because it explains some of the forensic techniques learned by the scientists at the actual body farm. But don't eat lunch while you're reading this one..."
5,Cornwell keeps getting better,"Kay Scarpetta is back, investigating the murder of Emily Steiner, an eleven year-old little girl. Her body shows cruel suffering and abuse. Who could have done it? Was it Temple Gault again? The MO certainly fits.And that's not the sole problem that gnaws at Kay's sanity. Lucy, her niece, seems to have made a true career ""faux pas"" by breaking into a top secret project at the FBI headquarters.As Kay tries to help find the murderer and prove that Lucy is innocent, she manages to alienate Pete Marino and get mixed up with a very married Benton Wesley.How will this turn out? You must read to find out. I know I certainly didn't put it down for a second. And when you reach the horrifying truth, it will make you thing twice about human nature. Overall, THE BODY FARM was an excellent read. I truly recommend it to everybody."
4,Nice Summary of Unreleased Bolan,"This CD is a great starting point for Bolan fans who have none of his myriad officially unreleased work. For those of us who know he was more brilliant than given credit for and already own some of the hundreds of his unreleased songs, this new CD may contain some duplication. But recommended anyway."
5,"Beats Star-Crap, No Contest","This beats the hell out of anything from Starbucks, the self-declared authority on ""good coffee"". What a joke.This is strong, flavorful, and not at all bitter. The ""Gourmet Blend"" is the best...almost tastes like dark chocolate. Coffee is now my favorite ""snack"". A spoonful or two of condensed milk and some ice (""cafe sua dat"") and you'll understand why coffee is as internationally popular as it is."
3,No Arabica beans exist in Vietnam today.,"Fact:Arabica beans no longer grown in Vietnam since early 80s because of lower yield compare to Robusta beans.Trung Nguyen is deceiving the consumers by stating their coffee consists of these beans.Reputable companies such as Starbucks,Eight o'clock...buy no coffee from Vietnam.Only P&G(Folgers) and some no name brands still do because of lower cost for Robusta beans."
3,No box or instructions,Purchased this game it did come before the date indicated when it would arrive. Game works fine but only down fall was it came with no box or instruction manual. I was not informed that the box or instruction guide was not included in the order like I had hoped but oh well..
1,Stay Away From This Book,"I have witnessed the antics of the author of this book numerous times on the internet. I had already decided that I really didn't like her but that, out of all fairness, I would read her book since I AM a long time Manilow fan.The author didn't let me down, the book was exactly what I had expected...a waste of time. I had a hard time even getting through the book, it was written so poorly.the author appears to have read every newspaper clipping and magazine article she could find...believed them as gospel..then copied what she read into the pages of this book.While there are a few interesting anecdotes included in this book, overall it's a waste of the paper it's printed on.My advice? buy another book."
2,NOTHING NEW AND DISAPPOINTING!,"Really, for someone who is expecting personal remarks of Barry himself given and researched by the author,this bookdoesn't review anything new.It is just a bunch of articles and internet material compiled by the writer and some supposed comments of people related to Barry somehow: friends, members of the band and even his stepmother! It seems that this author didn't have much interest in contacting the ""subject"" himself, since he is alive!!Unfortunately, this research has been made basically on press articles and stuff! the only worth-seeing material is a set of never-seen photos.I just have to remark that this book doesn't give Barry justice and could have been put more emphasis on his career instead of hearsays and unfair remarks on his personal life!"
2,fairly basic,this book didn't add anything into Barry Manilow's Career.it stopped at a certain point&was stuck there.it has some interesting blurbs but overall very tabloid in a lot of ways to me.it only goes to the Early 80's with Barry.He needs a new Book on His Career especailly after His Monster Year of 2002.
5,High Quality - Flew twice and TSA did not seize it.,It is a high quality knife. Both Wenger and Victorinox brands are legit swiss army knives. I only buy those two brands. Everything else is pretty much Chinese junk.TSA has stopped me both times to inspect. You should take out of luggage and put with misc items in tray. Makes it easier for them. Just explain it is TSA approved. The TSA told me the replacement for the blade is a lock pick.
5,Great series!,"I was so happy to receive this as a Christmas gift. I remembered liking the series when it was on. I watched it all in two days and then brought it to work to share with my coworkers. We watched an episode each day during our lunch break. We all laughed so hard that other people came in to see what was so funny. We looked forward to watching the series each day. Since it ended on a bit of a cliffhanger, we made up an ending for it. :)It really is too bad they canceled this show! The acting is superb and the writing is hysterical."
4,hilarious,loved this show when it was on tv and watching the 2nd time around was just as good. hilarious show. too bad it wasn't picked up for a 2nd season
3,Good enough,"This DVD player/VCR is pretty nice. It looks nice on the shelf and it works pretty well, but its a little confusing to use and set up. It is working well now, but not optimally because I can't quite figure it out."
5,Groban is Great,"This CD is a work of art! Every track is wonderful, beautiful and so fantastic. If you think his first CD was great then this one is beyond GREAT: Exceptional.I truly recommend this CD."
5,It's a C Gift,"How could it not be fabulous? Enaudi is almost a perfect compuser. Fabulous packaging, fabulous date for a fabulous friend."
1,Wrong part,"Different from what was ordered Buyer comments: I received a Coast Guard C-130, Red and with and Coast Guard markings. I ordered a Die-Cast C-130 Transport, USAF 8. (Air Force) Very displeased with return policy had to pay for the return postage. Told just to return and just reorder would not send a replacment."
4,Great vantage point into the streetracing scene,"I'm a fan of this DVD. It follows several regulars from the Toronto street racing scene for one ""season"" of building their cars and racing. You really get an insight into the personalities of the different racers and see what drives them to make their cars faster and faster. It's a lot more immersive than most ""streetracing"" movies out there. It also shows the other side of the law from the Canadian anti-street racing police force."
4,Classic,"I used to have a really old Gameboy, those big, huge gray ones. This was the first game I got for myself. The thing that I think is messed up is the fact that you can't save the game, so I never get to start off were I left off. I suggest this game to kids who are just starting playing Gameboy."
4,Great General Knowledge of Anatomy,If you want a general idea of anatomy this book is great. It goes through the whole book giving easily understood samples and pictures. The only minor problem i have with this book is that it doesn't go to in depth on explaning things but then again that's why it's called ridiculously simple and not in depth and complex.
3,"Good as a complement, bad for starting","If you already have studied clinical anatomy and still have some trouble remembering all those names, this book may help you. It has some intesting techniques to keep that vocabulary on memory.However, if you are just starting studying anatomy or if the subject is new for you and you just want to read a little about it, better look for another book. I found in the internet very good sites and understood better many basic things such as blood circulation in those sites than reading this book. If it will be your first meeting with anatomy vocabulary, get another book."
2,too superficial and badly organised,"I'm a med school student, and I hate to say that this book was not helpfull at all in my anatomy class.It doesn't get into the specifics we were requiered to know. In addition, it is organised by systems, which is too different from most books and atlases, which are organised by areas of the body (for example Moore's textbook or Netter's atlas).If you want a faster review book then your textbook, get Moore's essentials of clinical anatomy instead."
3,"Good, but not a classic!","I mistakenly bought this at the store where they didn't have ""Be My Valentine C. B."", so I wasn't aware that this was different. I thought I'd replace our old video, but, as it turns out, the old classic with the briefcases, the heart-shaped shaving lotion, Snoopy clipping a music box Valentine, and Linus hurling chocolates into Snoopy's mouth is not on this DVD. With 2 little ones with me, I did not take the time to read the back. This is for an older crowd. My preschoolers still beg for the old video, while my school kids DO enjoy this DVD (but no contest, the other one wins). I would regret my mistake except that it has 3 ""shows"" on it and supplements the original quite nicely. Just know that the original is not on here and you'll probably be more pleased."
4,Nathan Elite 1 Plus Angled 22-Ounce Waist Pack,Just as advertised. works well. the only thing is I don't use the smaller bottle b/c it makes it hard to put the larger bottle back in during the run.
3,For long runs...,Lots of bounce when the water bottle is full. Also felt a lot more weight on my hip/knee/ankle joints and my lower back. Usually I can run about 13 miles before I feel any joint discomfort but I only get about 5-6 miles before I feel it with the belt on.
1,Waste of Money,I bought this product and the first time i used it the leather cases started ripping and it does not properly fit on the phone it is intended for. The ear piece is terrible-- it is impossible for people on the other end to hear what your saying. The only good thing about the set was the car charger that I use a lot.
4,Hampton Fun,"A quick, easy, fun read. Mr. Lardo has connected with the two worlds of East Hampton; the dirt poor, born and bread locals and the powerful and indulgent weekenders who spen little time and much money in the East Ends most beautiful Village and Town. The book provides an enjoyable guided trip around the area while weaving a tale of power; greed; lust; murder and ambition. Mr Lardo's East Hampton is accurate and true."
2,Too sugary sweet,"This book would be good if the target market was high school girls.The premise was a good one for a interracial romance but apart from the speed in which both parties got involved, the love scenes were very tame, I found the heroine totally annoying. How could Vanessa allow a complete stranger who is not even a relative to break them up when she and Scott's families had no problem with the relationship? For a teacher she was totaly immature perhaps Scott should have gone after a woman instead of a girl. I have books 2-4 to read and hope they are much better."
4,Fujifilm Finepix CP-50 DC coupler AC Power Adapter..,"This coupler can be found on EBAY , it matches the AC powercord for the Fuji F-550 EXR camera ."
2,An over-rated set,"I have had these records for many years. I bought them because, in the 90s, they were recommended as the best available. Being unfamiliar with Scriabin's music, I hoped I would get to appreciate that composer. I never did, until recently I thought maybe it was the interpretation that did not do justice to them.How right I was! Browsing through a few clips on Amazon, I came across Ruth Laredo. I was captivated. Here the important notes came to the fore, and the accompanying figures receded. I still wonder that I could have ever tolerated Szidon's ""herds of charging elephants"", which muddied the waters whenever the music became turbulent or passionate. Laredo, by contrast, gives us a flowing and beautiful line, always clarifying and not obscuring the composer's intent.Buy this set only if you're a ""completist"": it contains some early work missing from the Laredo set and this - to be fair -Szidon plays well enoughStephen Fox (UK)"
3,Even though it's an autobio-there's some incorrect info.,"I liked the book, for the most part and found that it was a good portrayal of a life of a pregnant teen. Although I am a big fan of camaros and found that Beverly Donofrio's description of the ""cars that passed by her house"" were inaccurate in two ways. the sentence stating the ""powder blue camaros,"" passed by in front of her house. now in fact if it was 1963- the year of which she was telling this story you would have to realize that the camaro wasn't around until 1967. Also then you would have to realize that the camaro most likely wouldn't be powder blue- as a camaro is for the most part seen as a racing car. Now I know that this may seem like a little fact, but it distracted me enough to the point where it made parts of the story unbelievable and it is afterall an autobiography and thus should be factual- or at least somewhat factual. I read it and enjoyed it as a ""fun read"" but didn't really take it seriously after that point."
3,Fun,"This was imaginative and creative, but my kids liked it far more than I did. It was a combination of several different fairy tales all rolled into one. It was interesting and entertaining at least.The Illustrations: I liked the illustrations quite a bit. For the most part, the artwork enhanced the story and made it entertaining. It also worked well with the words to explain some of the parts that were a little vague or hard for kids to understand."
3,"Overall, good for an ABAP beginner.","I read this book as an introduction to ABAP before taking the SAP Partner Academy Course. I found it useful an an introduction. My one criticism, and it's a major one, is the large number of errors in the book. As a newcomer to SAP, I found it frustrating having to read a sentence or paragraph more than once, only to discover that an item or reference was in fact incorrect. Hopefully, they'll get it right for version 4."
2,"Hmmm, not what I'd expected.","I found the book EXTREMELY heavy on data dictionaries and internal tables, but VERY light (read - non existing) on external file imports or exports. It didn't have a section on BDC's. Functions & parameters were at the very end of the book (2/21 days!). One of the things I found most frustrating was that the book never indicated the version of SAP it was running on. While not a deal breaker, screen cams were hard to follow because they didn't look anything like my 4.5B system at work! If you want to learn about data I/O & reporting, I would suggest spending your money on ""Introduction to ABAP/4 - Programming for SAP"" instead."
3,A Very Good Book for starters...,"Greenwood's done a great job of getting me started in ABAP/4. I went through the material from cover-to-cover, and don't regret the time spent. However, I feel the book suffered a bit from the strictures of the ""21-Days"" format. I think I detect some severe editing in later chapters; chapters where I needed the same thorough treatment as in the earlier data dictionary material. This is a good one to start with, but plan on buying more books. In particular, don't look for any mention of SAPscript or dialog programming here, and don't try to use it as a language reference. Caveats notwithstanding, I'll recommend it to the next rookie."
1,What A Joke,"I don't know who came up with the idea to make a ""New Monkees"" but they must have been smoking their lunch. The whole concept was a total joke. There is no way in the world anyone could replace the original Monkees. The idea of trying was pathetic."
5,Excellent DVD !,"This is an excellent performance by our Mexican Diva Dolores del Río with an other great actress, the Argentine Libertad Lamarque. This movie is always watched on TV, at least in Mexico, every May 10, during the Mother's Day. It is a strong drama between two women and a son of one of them or may I say the same son for two mothers ?. This DVD is a treasure for Del Río's collectors or fans. Don't miss it !"
2,Disappointing,"If ever a couple was in need of pre-marital counseling, it's these two protagonists. It's surprising that the navy chaplain and bride's preacher father didn't insist upon it instead of pressuring them into a hasty marriage. The first half of this book was painful to endure because of the volitile and angry way Hannah and Riley interacted with each other. They seemed to be together for all the wrong reasons, constantly fighting over issues that could have easily been resolved through open communication. One of the reasons I love Debbie Macomber's writing is that her characters don't usually fall into this type of incessant bickering, so this couple's eventual conversion towards more respectful and loving banter was a welcome relief and redeemed the second half of the story."
2,It's OK to use,I buy it for mu old gateway computer.but not very well pit into AC connection part. so easily lose its connection.
1,i never got it,"unlike everyone else who just rate the game because they have it, not because they bought it, i am just here to say thati NEVER GOT IT. the end"
1,Idiocracy At It's Finest.,"$699.95? I guess people these days are that decelerated...I just went to my local video game trading store and bought two copies(one for myself and for my game collector friend), for $2.99 each.Whoever told you that this game is worth that much, must of had some kind of disability or something, because a common game like Super Mario Land 2, where even my neighbors have since they were young, is just plain wrong. Only a fool would buy from you, and don't expect this to sell.So before you put cheap and common games for a high price, please by all that is good do some research.I really hope I didn't loose some brain-cells for having to point out the obvious, because it really feels like I did."
2,red dot,"I was very annoyed when I received the pans.They were advertised as having a heat sensitive red dot, but I was sent pans without that feature."
4,Don't knock it...,Sure it would probably have been better if a new character was made gay versus an old standby. Everyone would have preferred that. But some people take what they can get. I enjoyed it.Yes I had to ignore that it made anachronistic mistakes. But geez louis its not a history lesson. Give it a break. I mean do you look at Superman and think its a history book?If you didn't like it... Is it that it was gay themed or was it that they changed some detail of a comic... Comic book characters change all the time. So did this one. If it was because it was gay themed then get ready to leave more bad reviews because it is not the last.If anything I enjoyed it because it was making history.
3,Not all I had hoped for,"The printer works great. However, I wanted a legal size flat screen. The descriptions on the printers will tell you what size documents they will print but I could not find anything that told me the size of the flat screen. The printer will copy and print legal documents by using the feeder. The worse thing there is nothing to catch legal size paper and so it just falls on the floor and if on a desk the papers end up in random order.Letter size documents and labels work great. There is a catch for them so documents do not fall on the floor.I also like the ink cartridges that come with this printer verses the cartridges on my earlier printers.Conclusion: If you deal in letter size documents or smaller this is a great printer. If you need legal size find another"
2,Don't bother with brother,"I bought the MFC5860CN based on the Brother description which states it prints 30ppm color and 25ppm B&W.; It prints closer to 4ppm. I called support and quickly got passed between 3 people (they at least speak English). However, they indicated to get that speed, the page being printed should have only 5% coverage (would that be 2.5 lines of text on a normal 8.5x11 page?), and the printer setting should be on ""fast"" (which unfortunately prints black text in a faint grey tone) and I should not begin timing until the first page completed (I timed from the start of actual printing of the first page). I don't know if other vendor's use these restrictive critera, but it seems like false advertising to me. Otherwise, its performance is average.Next time I will stick with HP which performed well for me in the past."
5,Belkin 4-Port Drive-Bay USB Hub,"Provides four hi-speed USB 2.0 ports at the front of your computer. Takes up one 3.5"" external facing, i.e. floppy drive, bay. Draws power from a standard 4-pin floppy drive power connector. Has a type-B USB connector on the card which you connect to an internal type-A port using the provided cable. The Belkin 5-port USB PCI card works great with it. Uses same mounting screws as a CDROM/floppy drive. Screw holes are on the sides only. Tested under WinXP, many flavors of Linux. To the OS it looks like any other USB hub. Works so well it's boring."
2,Uncomfortable,We bought this seat for our cruiser. I had a very difficult time getting it on the bike correctly. No matter how much I adjusted the seat it leaned to far forward. When I put the helmet on my child the head rest made her lean foreward even more. We returned the seat.
4,What is wrong with you people?,"I have two of these carriers. One was mounted on a 12 speed touring bike, the other on a mountain bike. They are easy to mount and remove due to the thoughtfully designed clamps.Our two kids love them. The only problem is that I don't see how they can be used up to 7 years. We last used them for 2 and 4 year olds, who were actually a little small for their age. Their knees keep poking you in the butt and thighs as you pedal. But this must be a problem on all child seats of this type.Also, you have to be careful when you the child is in the seat before you mount and after you dismount the bike. Again, all seats of this type will have this problem due to the weight distrubution."
5,Great fun,"When I first watched this series as a child, I fell in love with Jeannie. She is still just as delightful now as then. We watch this as a family, and it seems a little more dated to the children than Hogan's Heros, but they still enjoy it."
5,Long weekends with family are better with this.,"Well, in lieu of a longer review I will mention a few short comments I've gotten on this season set, which was a christmas present. It helped pass time agreeably, the show is great so it wasn't a bother that it was artificially colored, and finally a common response I got was, ""you only bought one season!"" Anyways, a most worthwhile $25 expenditure."
2,Coloring is terrible!,"I'm not reviewing the show itself, but rather the colorization. (If you've seen the show, you know whether you like it; if you haven't seen it, you can read the many other reviews.) The show is lighthearted fun and not to be taken seriously, but if I'm bothered by the colorization, it must be really bad. Unless you like Jeannie with orange hair and people who look like they've drunk a bottle of ink, skip this version and get the BW set. Then you won't be constantly distracted by weird and wrong colors."
2,I guess it'll work if you haven't seen the series.,"I looked forward to the release of IDOJ - TFS for some time. I was quite dissapointed to find out that the pilot is the edited, syndicated version, and NOT the original version as it aired in 1965. There are no subtitles during the scene on the beach when Jeannie is speaking Farsi. There are small cuts in the action, made only in recent years to allow more commercials. In the orgingal pilot, there were different fades used in between the acts and a longer end credit sequence. They even cut out the Screen Gems credit. I am a purist when it comes to things like this. Again, if you've never seen IDOJ, you might enjoy it. For me, this goes back in the box and back to the store."
2,Very amusing in hind-sight,"Written with good intention, however, the authors got ahead of themselves. Contents include what to stock in your pantry to survive the millenium crash, as well as how to negotiate looting and pillaging. Sorry grandma, but that's just too funny."
5,need more stars,"healthy by them selves, unbeatable with cheese & dips, can somebody tell me why 20 or more words are required for a review ?"
4,Hooked on Koop,"I am new to any type of jazz, period.I decided to expand my horizons and go with something completely new and different to me. After searching Amazon extensively in all jazz departments, I came across and ordered several ""jazz"" CD's, this one included.I am more than pleasantly surpised at how much I am digging this group. This is funky, groovy and relaxing all at the same time. Definitely what I was looking for and I will be buying more albums from this group. I am hooked."
1,It's just OK,"There is nothing special about these mixes and does not have repeated listening quality to me. I find these mixes boring and not imaginative. The reason I'm saying this cause ""Waltz for Koop"" the album where these mixes came from is a masterpiece! One of my most listened to albums. This album does not compliment the amazing quality of the original. Also recommend ""Streetlife Originals"" one of my favorite albums of all time."
5,Lasts over 30 years,"This is my best kitchen machine. We bought one when our daughter was born, now we're getting one for her as a 30 year birthday present!Bamix Hand Mixer Mono, White"
4,Why Use Economic Sanction ?,"After the Cold War ends, the relationships among countries have been more and more complicated and what is more and more important is the relations of economy and trade. The United States has learned to use Economic Sanction as a useful foreign instructment since the government found it works in the case of South Africa. We can see many examples that the States uses sanctions to punish countries which refuse to obey the international order or to respect the human rights. But why does the government use economic sanctions and not use military forces? Readers can find all the answers in this book, ""Economic Sanctions As Instruments of American Foreign Policy"". It includes not only the cases but also the really skillful analysis. All students who are instrested in Economic Sanction will find that this book is so easy to been understood and will get a lot of emplications form it."
3,MI intern,This is a great book to study off of. If you need a quick review and aren't looking for useless details this is your book. There are quick lists and drop downs that make going over a topic easy. It doesn't go into great detail but allows someone the opportunity to use one page in order to get the pertinent points of a topic or diagnosis.
1,"Very small, did not fit 2 mantle lantern see dimensions in review","The dimensions are not listed on the product info but would of been helpful and may help someone else purchasing this item.3"" diameter by 3-1/2"" in height, I did not have the model number of my lantern so I kinda guessed by the picture. This globe did not fit my 2 mantle lantern."
4,"Great concept, good characters, can't wait for the next one","I love Margaret Weis but I have to admit I like her better when she writes on her own. My favorite was the star of the guardian series. This is the first in what must be a series and although I understand it does alot of setting up for the other novels i was a bit disappoint with the Sandra's character and how it was treated. The romance needed more developement and I was alittle disappointed with what happens with the end. I felt the focus should have stayed on her and him rather than him and the brother.Still excellent overall, it can only get better from here."
5,Memorable music,"An unusual blend and mix of attractive styles, makes this a rewarding experience for listeners. Constistently memorable melodies and strong harmonies throughout, strengthened by a powerful religious faith."
2,"OK, but a little difficult and few passwords","I'm only on level 2, and I think the game is ok, but the scenery is a little boring (the same a lot of the time). Also, it didn't give me a password on level 1, so I have to keep repeating it. It says in the manual that passwords are given at certain times, but I didn't get any until I went on the internet to get them. I'm glad that I rented this game because I'm not gonna buy it."
4,I need the change,"I like variety in my work out so these DVD's offer new ways to do so. That's always great for me. If you have some coordination and balance, you'll have no problem."
5,Great tea...my favorite,"I have used this tea for years. I love it. It is convenient, wonderful tasting and easy to use. Love the size and the tubes. I love that I can add my own sweetner as well."
3,Doing is better than reading,"I purchased this book after visiting New Zealand. Specifically, the area where Rohan was set up. I would not have bought this book otherwise, but it became a nice companion when i wanted to remember the lay of the land and the challenges one only experiences in New Zealand. To get to this place, one must walk from a road, across a cow field, through 3 rivers (ice cold and too wide to jump, mind). So for me it was worth it. If you don't have an unusual love for the films or another big reason to get this book, you're probably wasting your money."
5,A League of Her Own,"The smooth jazz genre can be such a trap for artists to create generic music so they can get on the radio. Not Mindi Abair. She comes along and creates a new style all her own. The nuances and structural approach of a singer/songwriter applied to instrumental music. She's done it again here with this new album. Distinctive, creative, melodic and funky. And instead of another typical r&b cover, Mindi pulls out Ricki Lee Jones' ""Must Be Love"" and gives it a unique spin with her cool vocals. This is a must buy."
5,What a ride!!!,Wow! After hearing Mindi's music on the radio for some time I finally decided to buy one of her cd's. I am so glad that I did. This album is an emotional journey from start to finish. There were times when I felt like I had to catch my breath. Some songs made me want to dance and some songs made me feel. This is easily the best instrumental album that I have heard this year. I especially love the song Rain that she wrote for the victims of Katrina. It kind of reminds me of something Sting might do if he were a sax player. Thank you Mindi!!!!!
5,Gave this as a present,"Gave this watch as a present and it really hit the mark. The tastefully simple design with Roman numeral markers, Guillouche pattern and exhibition case back exude sophistication. The only nitpick I have with this white dial version is that the Roman numeral markers are just raised and painted black while the black dial version has individually applied chrome Roman numerals, which I feel look higher quality.For the short time I had the watch it seemed to be running 10 seconds fast per day vs the atomic clock. Not too bad. The leather band looked nice, but was very stiff, probably since it was brand new. For the price, you get a stylish Swiss mechanical watch with sapphire crystal and exhibition caseback that looks much better in person and is appropriate for all occasions, but get yours soon. I've noticed the prices are appreciating faster than most investments."
4,a solid novel by a masterful storyteller,"Set in a world similar to Marion Zimmer Bradley's Darkover series, K.D. Wentworth's Moonspeaker overcomes its generic trappings with unexpected grace and humor. But wheras Bradley relies on the over thirty novels in her series, set over a period of many centuries, to provide her readers with a complex and fully realized backdrop, Wentworth accomplishes the same feat in one short novel."
2,Bait and Switch,"Although the picture showed a funky design, the strap sent was without any design, plain black. It holds the mandolin as well as any thong, but was diappointing. I would have returned it if my daughter had not needed it for her recital."
3,Good Stylish Strap,"This is a perfect strap sized just right for mandolin.I would have given it five stars except mine arrived with a paper label glued to the back of the strap, which when peeled off left a sticky spot on the strap where it would press against the mandolin finish."
5,Excellent product,"We use it everyday, several times at day and after 3 months still working same as first day, would recommend at everybody."
4,Works great so far,"I just installed this a couple of days ago, and so far I like it very much.The only reason it's getting four stars instead of five is that the instructions did not include my toilet's setup, so it was mildly frustrating to figure out how to make it work. What I had to do was remove the plastic alligator clip from the long hose (which wasn't all that easy to do) and then insert the hose right into the hole where the original hose had been. All's well that ends well."
4,Works Great,"Now in use over 30 days, and our toilet has never been cleaner. Highly recommended and will order more for our home, office and church!"
4,Flush and Sparkle,"The product works! The issue is finding ""bleach"" refill cartridges. Most stores only sell ""blue"" refills."
4,Pretty cool,"This game was pretty cool, but I had failed to read the instruction manual and got really frusterated at a few levels. I think its really cool that it keeps sending on new challenges. I would recomend this to people with at least a sliver of patiance though."
3,STOP OVERPRICING YOUR GAMES!,"These Mario Gameboy games are not even worth these hundreds of dollars. I can easily go to a local game store and get these games for under $10. If anyone has purchased these ridiculously overpriced games then I salute you, I salute you for being a disgrace to your under developed brain."
2,The same,"If you read my review of a turtles tale, it the same. Its just a knock off of nemo and a shark's tale. Rent or buy used. Or better yet search for someone who has it and ask to borrow with a quick return. After you take it out the DVD no matter what time you watch it, you will forget how much gas cost and make an effort to return it to the person you borrowed it from. LOLOLOLOL!!!!!!XD"
5,Good Movie,This is a good movie. Good graphics. Good music. Kids love watching this with their friends. I like to watch this as well. Nice family movie.
3,It sets nicely on the shelf,"We bought this buzz for our daughter last christmas. She was in love with Toy Story 2 and had to have him. We got this one because they didn't have any plush toys or buzz that she could actually play with. When his battery worked we had him set up to ""guard"" her room, and that was nice, except at bed time, she would want to play with him if we forgot to turn him off. We couldn't really let her play with him too much because he is bulky and we felt he would probably break easily. Now, almost a year later his battery has worn out of course and we have nooooooo idea where they go. We don't even have a screwdriver small enough to find out. So, poor buzz sits on the shelf silently waiting for us to figure him out. I am not upset that we bought him, at least my daughter likes having him there, but I do wish we had been able to find a more playable buzz."
1,SO DISSAPOINTED =(,"I ORDERED THESE FOR A CHRISTMAS PRESENT AFTER READING GOOD REVIEWS. THE PICTURE OF THE EARRINGS IS VERY DECEIVING. AND AT FIRST I THOUGHT THAT THEY MAY HAVE SHIPPED ME OPALS. NOW I DONT HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO RETURN THEM AND FIND A NEW GIFT BY CHRISTMAS. THE EARRINGS DO NOT SPARKLE AT ALL AND THE COLOR IS WHITE.. NO CLARITY AT ALL...I AM FINDING IT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT THE REGULAR RETAIL PRICE OF THESE IS OVER $400.OH WELL.. IF IT SOUNDS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE.... WELL, WE ALL KNOW THE REST OF THE SAYING.HAPPY HOLIDAYS TO ALLSigned,A very dissapointed Mom"
1,SCARED STRAIGHT IN THE WRONG WAY,"This movie had a big impact on me. I attempted suicide two timesafter I watched this, because I know I was headed for prison for a crime I did not commit.So much for the positive impact.This proves the prison system completely fails as a correctional facility.The students or convicts should get no praise, what so ever,for this trash."
5,Great gift,The watch arrived on time as promised. It was a gift for my wife and she loves it. She says it is very comfortable to wear and likes the appearance. It's not as glitzy as some of her crystal adorned watches but she loves diamonds and so is very happy.
1,mine did not workT-T,my camera did not end up working 1 star im very disappointed in the purchase i dont get feed back from the camera as i should and it keps saying no blank frmaes
4,game boy camra,do you have a game boy and you want a 600 doller digital camra?well it is not in 1st class but is verey fun but you can do i thing that a digatal can do! you can add funny stuff on you photoand it verey neat this item is a great toy!!!
4,Review for ds game folio,"I just recieved the ds game folio and after examing it, it's a pretty good case. The DS goes on the bottom under 2 straps and above are two fairly large mesh pockets for games and accessories. I was able to store the ac adapter in one pocket and put two games in another pocket. I think that both pockets store maybe 4 games each. There are no outside pockets, so although this case is better then the ds safe case, it could have been better. Still at 4 stars, you can't go wrong with this case."
2,boring for my 2-year-old,"My 2-year-old did spend a few minutes looking at this book and getting a kick out of seeing the moon ""grow"" as the pages are turned. However, the picture does not change much from one page to the next and so this book is rarely read."
2,Dave In Changes,"It would seem utterly simple, the world didn't need another so-so Dave Mason compilation. His career, while hitting a commercial peak in the latter seventies, has been a disappointment for the most part, especially after his great debut long-player, ""Alone Together."" A solo single from 1969, ""Little Woman,"" would have been a welcomed treat, as would any tracks from the long-gone, ""Dave Mason Is Alive."" If there's any reason at all to own ""Ultimate Collection,"" it's for the oft-forgotten, ""Satin Red And Black Velvet Woman."" These cross-label compilations are generally to be avoided, as labels often loan out reference master tapes to other labels, resulting in inferior quality of sound. Unless you're of the notion of having to have the one exclusive track, fans and casual listeners should skip this superflous release."
2,Gundam FAIL,This looks like an awsome toy but its not. First of all its way to small. the coulours are terrible and its to exspensive. Its not worth 15 to me its worth 5. The head piece always falls off. its better to buy a bigger model.
3,"MVP 2005 Much, Much Better!!","This game has so many glitches and flaws that it is dominated over by MVP Baseball 2005 so much, that it's not even funny. 2K5 has poor baserunning, hitting, fielding, throwing, and menu setup. The only good part is the highly accurate stadiums and rosters and the ESPN announcers that make it sound like a real baseball game. The graphics aren't even good! Other than that, the game lacks in so much that it cannot really be considered a great baseball game. MVP 2005 on the other hand is a fantastic game and if ur looking for an awesome baseball game with great graphics, color, gameplay, sound and just about everything else...then MVP Baseball 2005 is the game for you, not 2K5."
5,favorite book of all time,"My title says it all. I worship this book. Ito is a genius. Out of the 3 books in the series, this is my fav. I've scored earlier editions, with colorful covers and larger pages but those are nearly impossible to find now. Stop reading this and order.P.S. he has written many other manga but none live up to this. Gyo is too graphic for my tastes but Tomie/the Haunted Mansion and some other of his short stories are decent.)"
4,Easy to read Civil War history.,"I bought the abridged version here instead of the two - volume set. This book was great! The chapters were fairly short and McPherson's writing style is easy to read. It was an ""optional"" book for a course I took in college and I'm glad I bought it. It focuses on the social and political aspects of the Civil War as much as the battles. I really like that. It begins with politics in the election of 1860 and ends with Reconstruction. When it does discuss battles, it has maps to show you the various stages and days visually. I recommend this book for anyone interested in the Civil War, including historians, students, and History teachers."
3,Buy it for one person...,Natalie Raitano is HOT!!! Pam Anderson can't hold a candle to Natalie; that's the only reason I can think to purchase this dvd collection.
3,comp,a compendium of previously published material garnered from several sources--not too exciting for a real aviation buff
2,blatantly slanted,"The book was disappointing. It was published in 2002, plenty of time to mention Condoleeza Rice, the first female African-American Secretary of State. Instead, the women in politics parts focuses on Hilary Clinton and Geraldine Farraro. The book has a definate Liberal slant. There were other notable female authors who were excluded who have made hefty contributions to the literary world and social commentary. It was really biased. Next time, make more than 33."
2,tribeca women's fast low wedge,The shape and thinness of the wedge heel on this shoe is very uncomfortable to walk and wobbly.
3,Half decent old GameBoy fighter,"When Killer Instinct became a smash hit on the Super NES, it seemed inevitable that a stripped down conversion would come to the GameBoy. This portable version of Killer Instinct is missing a fighter or two, but the graphics and overall gameplay remain remarkably faithful to it's arcade and 16-bit counterpart. The two button control scheme makes the crazy multi-hit combos easier than ever before to pull off, but special moves themselves can be a pain to do. Not to mention due to the fact this is a game for the original black and white GameBoy the graphics are very hard to see, especially if the background arena is dark. Some of this can be corrected thanks to a lighting option offered in the game's option screen, but problems still persist. All in all, Killer Instinct may not be the same great fighter it was in the arcades and on home systems, but it is one of the better original GameBoy fighters available."
1,Terrible,"Could not get past the first chapter and a half. Immature characters, sloppy writing. You'd think it was Seems targeted towards teenagers with all the bodily fluid descriptions and jokes . Terrible!"
4,Quite Ugly One Morning,It was a good book I enjoyed reading it. The end was very good. Took a little time getting used to some of the English phrases and slang
5,The best in British fiction,"Quite Ugly One Morning opens with quite possibly one of the funniest chapters ever written. This one is not for the faint hearted. It is highly irreverant, witty and downright naughty. A genuinely fast paced novel very much a roller coaster of detective sleuthing and dark comedy. Works well alongside works by Ian Banks and Colin Bateman."
5,Arrived on time and works well,Arrived on time and works well. Good memories :) No issues with the game working or the shipment arriving on time.
2,Hard game!,"This game is extremely hard to anyone that isn't an experienced gamer! There are no saves or passwords, and I can't get very far at all. I don't recommend it to anyone just looking for a fun game to play"
5,Lots of great info!,"We are what we eat. Our pets are are what they eat, too. I bought this book to educate myself on what my beloved pets were eating, and boy was I in for a shock! This book goes into great depth of what is put into our pet's food and HOW it is allowed. It explains exactly what byproducts are, etc. It is all SCARY and sickening! It all comes down to the mighty dollar. This book has allowed me to make better choices in what my dogs eat... and it is not one of the highly advertised dog foods seen on TV."
1,"The book is mostly conjecture, speculation and innuendo","The information is mostly conjecture, speculation, innuendo, sensationalism and histrionics. Statements have been taken out of context and some portions have been omitted to lead the reader to draw the conclusion intended by the author.Clearly the ravings of an extremist with an agenda."
2,emotional generalization,Very little general research. Some concentrated research at specific sites. There was no statistics as to how many meal suppliers and of course no data could be provided from them. No indication as to who or how many used the meal described. The last 1/2 to 3/4 of the book read like the ravings of an unfocused person. Lots of emotion not much body.
1,NOT HIS BEST,"If you are a Jeff Foxworthy fan as I am, you look for more enjoyment from his performances than this DVD presents.Watched it once and gave it to Goodwill.John"
1,Egads bad,This book is so bad I can't remember a worse book - surely there is one but this nightmare is full of uninteresting and rather stupid characters. Do not waste your time!
3,Not To Be Overlooked,"I can't understand why this film has been overlooked for so long. You've got Sidney J. Furie directing Sinatra and a solid supporting cast with a good storyline. Playing somewhat out of character as a fallguy trying to discover what's going on, Sinatra does an extremely credible job of portraying Sam Laker. Peter Vaughan, playing the ""instigator"" Slattery, is so good that I wanted to do away with him myself. It was great to see Nadia Gray again in a small but effective role. The only complaint is that it seems as though the entire film was dubbed in afterwards. There's a great and very satisfying finale that gives you reason to project what might happen next. This film deserves to be seen and I highly recommend it."
1,Dont get this game,"This games graphics were very choppy. The super moves are very cool, but they almost never worked because the control was incredibly bad. There are many other fighting games better than this."
5,Very nice Lights,These lights are very bright for the size. I got 4 of them running on a light bar and they can reach out and light up a pretty good amount of area. So far they seem to be well made even though it might take a minute to figure out the wiring(which i didn't use only looked at)I would easily and probably will buy more of these
4,Lights,I put the lights on my Gravely zero turn tractor. It works great for snow plowing at night. It also came with a off and on switch
2,Sounds like it was recorded in a tin can,"Half the songs sound horrible, poor recordings.Save your money.There are a couple of good cuts, suggest listening to the samples and downloading only the ones you like."
4,Great to hear something different from them!,I'm always interested in hearing unreleased tunes from artists. There are several on this disc. I enjoyed it. It's worth buying.
4,Must for a true Doors fan,"A great album. The only real downside is that if you own the box set you are only getting one new song (woman is a devil). Although it is a good song, it is not worth buying this whole album unless you are a Doors freak. A few of the songs are some of the demos that the band passed around to record companys before Electra signed them, and the recording quality on these are poor. It does feature great versions of already released songs though. ""Moonlight Drive (sunset sound version)"" is pretty good, and ""The Hyacinth House"" is excellent. ""Who Scared You"" and ""Whiskey, Mystics, and Men"" ,2 songs that were previously unreleased on albums (but part of the box set), are what really make this a great record. Overall, if you are a Doors fan this is a must have. Be warned: if the only Doors songs you know of are ""Light my Fire"" and ""Break on Through"", this album isn't for you."
1,Absolute Garbage,Didn't last 3 months before problems....never printed good pictures...Keeps displaying Cover Open.....But No Covers are open so No Function will work......COST more to have it repaired than it cost New.....Guess I'll Try HP
4,over all a nice machine,"I like this compact machine, it works well for a home office. the printing quality is not excellent, but it is ok for me since i have a printer. the handset is small and it is not a good looking one. you need to purchase a USB line in order to connect with a computer since it do not come with the pakage. Amazon shipped pretty fast."
1,Just Punched a Hole in Mine,"I have NEVER had much trouble with printers. They get a few years old and just stop working. But I've had nothing but problems with this horrific device! From the beginning, the manual was in Chinese, the operation was so complicated that I had to refer to (and decipher) the manual over and over. Just changing the ink carts was ridiculous, as the stupid thing ALWAYS said ""no cartridge"" until you pounded the new one in with your fist (all three colors and black did the same thing). Had to ""clean"" the black each and every time I wanted to print a letter, resume, etc. More smudged and faded prints than should ever be put up with. Won't ALLOW you to print if the idiotic thing PERCEIVES that ink in ANY cartridge is low (even if it's almost half full)!!!! I would never buy anything from BroHoe again, and suggest you STAY AWAY!"
1,nightmare,"I bought this printer (brother MFC-3360C) a few years ago from office depot because it was on sale. I rarely use printer, once in a while I used it for faxing a document, print something or rarely for copy or scan. I can say that it was the worst printer that I have ever seen! loading papers is very difficult & frustrating, after you put the papers and try to print something, it starts cleaning itself for about a minute or two, then if you are lucky it print a page or two for you. The other issue is that if it gives you an error during the job,which happens frequently, you are not able to turn it off, you have to unplug it, leave it for a while, then start it again. Today I am so happy that I just wanted to print one page and I found the printer dead! I got rid of it eventually!"
2,Seller neglected to include all parts,"The book itself was fine, but it's supposed to be a book with a violin part that pulls out of the piano accompaniment. The seller sent only the piano accompaniment part rather than both."
2,unsecure container,"The lids on some of the oil quarts were not secure, and there was oil that leaked through the box, when it had arrived. I would not order this on-line again for this reason."
4,I have to give it 4 stars because extended performance is better,"BMW Z4sport package, requires oil change every 15000 miles. Now when I know that I wish I've bought better version of this which is Extended performance version. Mobile 1 rocks otherwise."
2,Over priced and hyped,Over rated. If you decide to use this brand I recommend changing you oil every 4-5000 miles.I've moved back to Kendall synthetic and change my oil every 4-5000 and it runs better then M1 did on my car.
5,A Superb Patchwork,"I had high hopes for this album, and I was not dissapointed. From her first notes, Belle du Berry's voice mesmerized me, her lyrics made me smile, and the gypsy/cabaret/spanish music made me tap my feet. Even if you don't speak french, buy the album. The music in and of itself is enough."
5,Guitars stays in tune!!!,Excellent capo. The guitar doesn't go out of tune when putting on the capo and low profile doesn't get in the way. When using my Kyser capos my left hand would bump into the big handle and I was having to re-tune the guitar after I put it on. I use several partial Kyser capos and now I'll probably switch to all Shubbs.
1,Too much money for limited content,"When I first saw this title, I was quite excited to see it. Although it was pricey, I figured with three DVDs, there must be tons of content so I purchased it and was quite disappointed. The only disc with content was disc one and there was only about 40 minutes worth. The other two DVDs were Saturn launches and that's about it. The box said over six hours of content but only about 40 minutes of it was a documentary and I guess five hours of launch footage (I never watched all of the launches). I doubt very much that I will purchase other content from this series."
4,"A definite ""must have"" for NASA-philes","If you have a NASA addict in your family, this (and the other three titles in the series) are a ""must have"". I enjoyed the documentary (approx. 40 min.) but the other 5+ hours is just NASA footage, without narration, from various observation cameras. Boring, you say? Yes, I do, too. But I bought them for my husband, and it's probably the best gift I've given him in the past 20 years. If you put any rocket on the screen he's hooked, but with these DVDs he enjoys the multi-angle aspect, and will watch the same blast off from all possible angles. This is not everyone's cup of tea, obviously, but if you have to get a gift for someone who is fixated on the American space program, you can't get much better than this. I expect to find the Apollo sets more interesting, but he started watching the Gemini and Saturn sets first."
5,The classic,"The 1st realistic animated fighting ever made. With Kano, Liu Kang, Raiden, J. Cage, Scorpion, Sub-Zero, And Sonya, they're unstoppable. Mortal Kombat Is the Classics!"
1,"Did They Really Need to Rip-Off Pamela Anderson ""V.I.P.""","Title of my review pretty much says it all. This show often copied the same plots as Pam Anderson's ""V.I.P."" which isn't saying a hell of a lot, but at least V.I.P. pulled theirs off with style. Boo.And of course they're releasing it on the same day as V.I.P. to confuse the marketplace and hope a few fools pick this disc set up instead. Double Boo."
2,"Great toy, but music is OFF KEY","My baby daughter loves this toy. I think it is a great idea for a toy. HOWEVER.... the voice singing is in one key, and the music is in another key, and they play at the same time. I am a musician and this drives me crazy. The voice sounds horrible. Could this teach my child to sing off key? I hope not! I thought this was a battery issue, but I changed the batteries and unfortunately, it is still functioning the same way. If you are musically inclined, don't buy this toy - it will drive you crazy too."
2,Poorly Organized!,"The pathologies are NOT INCLUDED IN THE INDEX. This is completely counterintuitive. Instead, the pathologies are listed somewhere in the front (and only there). I still don't understand how a publisher can print a book with an index that excludes the most essential content. Encephalopathy is in the index. Encephalitis is not. I have to go to the front of the book for that to find the page number. It defies logic.Many of the pathologies included don't make much sense where they are (ie, scleroderma is listed as a muskuloskeletal disease). The ""in brief"" sidebar of whether massage is indicated or contraindicated is a great idea, but is overly verbose and complex. A simplified ""at a glance"" format would be much easier for learning and understanding."
1,Buyer Beware- incorrect information,"All you have to do is look at the referances the author sited for this book to be scared by it- few and unreliable. Please note that there are sections in here that are absolutely incorrect. If you just want to pass National cert. this is a great book. But if you honor your proffession and wish to know pathology - not just what National Cert asks you (often incorrectly).... Look more. Please respect yourself and your client, and buy a book with complete and correct information"
1,New Sound? Hah!,"If anyone has had the unfortunate circumstance of having to listen to this band, I pity you. Having been subjected to their 'sound' I can tell you it is neither unique nor groundbreaking. Each song is loud and missing hooks necessary to draw in a listener. This band consisting of a whiny malcontent lead singer, a lead guitarist who has not one memorable guitar lick to speak of writes a collection of songs which at least rhyme, but that is hardly a reason to consider this a worthwhile purchase. The lead singer promises that it is new music and a new sound but delivers nothing short of the kind of unremarkable drivel that has turned the music scene into a wasteland."
4,Great Sound But Has Many Repeats,"Beauty From Pain 1.1 is another very good album by Superchick. It has lots of songs with great lyrics and sound.The downside to this album is that it is almost all songs that have been released previously. There are some remixes and one new song. The new one, ""Stand In The Rain"" is great. All of the songs are good or very good. I just don't know if this album is worthwhile for someone who already has their 'Beauty From Pain' and 'Regeneration' albums. One might be better off to buy 'Stand In The Rain' from I Tunes or another digital music service.This group has a lot of talent both in terms of songwriting and playing. I hope that their next album continues their pattern of writing original songs, rather than re-releasing previous material.If you don't have any Superchick albums, I would definitely recommend this for any fan of high quality, energetic music."
2,Poor Picture Quality,"If you want sharp, clean pictures do not buy this camera. I figured 7.1MP with a 3"" LCD, how could I go wrong? I'll be returning this camera.The picture quality is horrible. 9 out of 10 pics are grainy/noisey. If you want sharp, clean pics this is not the camera to buy. I honestly think my old 4MP camera took better quality pics. I can only give this camera two stars for the following:Best features:3"" LCDOn screen help and instructionWorst feature:Picture quality is poor."
2,shutter speed: too slow!,"With all honesty i am lazy in reading any manuals so i am just rating this with a bit of experience. I actually have my camera for more than a year now and still, i haven't read my manual so i can't really complain much. But this camera frustrates me though in terms of the shutter speed, it really sucks unless there is a way in the ""manual"" to adjust it. Sometimes image are good but sometimes not. I can't really say if it's a good camera or not but i guess the best way is to read the manual which i am planning to do pretty soon so i won't waste the money that i spent for it. In short, if you are not planning to read the manual or lazy enough to do so i would say do not buy this product, it will frustrates you too."
3,A study in the deterioration of country in the wake of rock...,"The first two discs are great! Sonny starts out in the popular early-'50s Hank Williams style with stronger than average vocals. By the mid-'50s, he was making pure pop. Background vocals, strings, lyrics for teens, blah. James' voice is a thing of amazing beauty and he could have set the honky tonk scene ablaze if he had stayed true. Unfortunately, Sonny and Ken Nelson headed in a different direction. Sad, sad, sad."
4,Good Source for Volunteer Teachers,"We used this book for our Jr High group and it is especially well suited for those that volunteer to teach but have limited preparation time. The activities were well received by our students, and the lessons generated some good discussion. We rotate our teachers at this time because we meet during church and this type of curriculum worked well for a rotation system. Worth a look. Made a good summer series since each lesson is self contained and not dependent on last weeks."
5,JUST LIKE MAMA MADE,BEST ITALIAN COOK BOOK I HAVE EVER USED. HAVE GIVEN OVER 20 COPIES AS GIFTS WITH WITH OUR COMMENTS NOTED ON OUR FAVORITES. A MUST FOR EVERY HOUSEHOLD.
4,Great beginners gun,"For anyone just getting into BB pistols, this one is great!It's fairly light, but feels substantial in your hands.It uses CO2 so it has some good power to it. 480FPS is quite powerful. It emits a nice BAM with each shot.The trigger is double action, which means it cocks and shoots in one trigger pull, and because of that it's a very long pull. But once you get used to it it's fine.The gun shoots fairly accurately, but a little high. But it does so consistently so you can learn around it. Or set your scope/sight a little higher.Overall I'm happy with this gun. And FYI, it's cheaper at wally world."
4,pros vs. cons,this gun is remarkable in its own right i have the gun currently and i like it.but there are pros and cons just like everything elsethe pros.this gun is extremely accurate and has no blowbackvery powerful for its sizecan use bothe metal and plastic (metal recomended)easy to carry around/ little weight and size.the cons.hard to reloadkind of hard triggergreat air consumptionnon concealable lever on the bottom(as shown in the picture)but over all i would recomend this to any person looking for a little target practice
1,Dreadful and repetitive,"I was looking forward to this cd, but was disappointed. The rhythm section is deadly in a metronomic way. Almost every song begins and sounds the same. I think his style of playing does not lend itself to Christmas music, especially with such a lame, overproduced back-up."
1,Unable to play,The CD would not copy to I Tunes. I am extremely dissaponted.Why would this be the only music of B B King not to download?
3,Be informed of customer service and the ways they make extra money!!!,"Bought an HP Photosmart R717 in the summer of 2005 for $324.74. 4 months after the camera warranty was up and after minimal usage the camera was displaying: 0000000F-10FB-1BD-024 Error Message, on the display screen.When I called HP about getting my camera repaired I was told that it would be too expensive to repair. I was informed it would cost around $200.00 dollars to receive most likely a refurbished replacement camera, with only a 3-month warranty.After trying the replacement camera for 15 days I was then to send my old camera back as partial payment for the replacement camera.I told HP no thanks, because they had already gotten enough money from me."
1,HP PhotoSmart R927,I just happened to meet this old friend here on Amazon again! which worked for me only 1 year and ... I bought this camera when it just came on Amazon and used to cost more than $400.00I really took care of it as far as protecting it in its holder. Always waited till its battery get empty then recharge it but it only worked for less than a year. I changed its battery but ordered a new battery but no luck. it will not turn on or if it would it will work only for few minutes and back to coma.I will not recommand it.
3,troubled!,The camera has a slight opening on the top as id pried or picked. There were no instructions on how to operate the camera. I bought a manuel from another source and still in the process of trying to operate the camera and maybe use the parts that came with the camera. May have to get the softwear as well. Still at a lost as to what I can do.
2,Slow,"While my wife loves the TV game she found this one to be slow. You must scroll through the alphabet to spell out your answer (all before the clock runs out). Is is a slow moving game, but is fun if you love trivia and have nothing better to do."
5,Joan of Arc is so inspirational!,"I love all the Wishbone eposodes, but this one is by far the best. I love the story of Joan and what she did for France, it is an amazing story and Wishbone is an amazing show! Because of Wishbone I know what some of the classic books are about, which is nice to know."
4,"A fun read, espeically if you know the academy","This is a fun book, especially for those who've taught in a university setting. Kupfer's writing rings very true to life, as does her portrayal of the average slack-jawed college student. I read it at the shore -- it's a great book for a summer weekend."
5,Cloak and Dagger in the Jungle,Lonely Vigil is an absolute page turner from beginning to end. Walter Lord did a fine job putting together the story of the many coastwatchers in the Solomon Islands. There are many first person accounts of incidences on all the major islands. I especially liked the chapter on Donald Kennedy and his native guerilla army and their incredible exploits against the Japanese. Why a movie hasn't been made about this guy I don't know. The book covers a number of different coastwatchers and holds the readers attention very well. The photos and maps are a big plus as well. It's to bad that most people in the US don't know more about these brave and resourceful men. During this period of WW2 the issue was still in doubt and the coastwatchers played a tremendous role in turning this around. It would have been a priviledge to serve with and know these men and the brave Solomon Islanders who risked everything by standing by them. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this book
2,deceptive,"Buyer beware. These pieces are not playable unless you have magical vision or infinite patience. They are written by hand (reproductions of Satie's notation), and the notations are very small; also, the right and left hand parts are not always clearly aligned. Obviously, this is period souvenir, not a score to actually be played."
3,Okay for beginners and not much for anyone else,"This was meant for people starting out Grateful Dead collections. All but one song on this album is from the studio recordings. The one ""live"" song was actually overdubbed in the studio. I really don't care for this myself in fact in my original review I only gave it one star due to what it is missing-Terrapin Station, Playing In The Band and given the fact that there are more live releases out there than ever before I personally think it missed the boat not including any of that. However, I have since met a couple of people who have been turned on to the band through it so I guess it isn't a bad place to start. It should have been at least two cds."
1,fatal flaw on CD playing,"yes, the equipment is a good deal at first glance.After a while, you'll find out you won't play CDs.Denon has disappointed many loyal customers by this failure."
1,Avoid this system,"This system is no longer manufactured, but I was very interested in getting the HDCD capability in addition to the other features, and when I saw that it was available as a cut-price refurb, I bought it. This was a mistake. I now find that the S-301 has numerous reports of video dropout problems, and I'm getting the same thing. Refurbished does not mean fixed. Do not buy it."
3,Great Sound W/ a couple negatives,"My wife and I very much enjoy the sound this unit produces. Unfortunately the unit I received has the same problem experienced in other reviews. The video signal is lost momentarily and then returns. Very annoying! Also the 'HELP' function on the remote that initiates the on screen set up display, stopped functioning. Could not scroll up and down through the menus. Sending the unit back to Amazon. I have ordered the Sony DAV-X1. This unit has received more favorable reviews, and purchased for a lot less money."
4,Here's the story with the Denon S-301,"I bought this home theater system from Crutchfield--not Amazon (because although Amazon is my overall favorite online store, the bad experience I had with a television purchase has made me vow to never buy another big-ticket item from Amazon ever again). Nevertheless, here's the deal with the video problem associated with the Denon S-301. According the Crutchfield tech support, any unit manufactured prior to June, 2006 will have a chance of producing the video error. The error I speak of is the random dropping of the video signal when viewing a DVD movie while connected to your television via HDMI. It took me a total of three returns before I found this out, but fortunately, Crutchfield picked up the tab all three times. Whether Amazon will do this for their customers, I do not know."
2,A misguided attempt,"This book is subtitled, a first look at disability. I ask this though; wouldn't kids get a much better first look across the lunch table at their neighbourhood school? I'm not sure why authors think that we need all of these books to teach us about disability, It seems like an n out-of-date notion to me. Give us an engaging storyline not a medical lesson."
4,Great book!,This is a great book if you want an imressive insight into the world of professional windsurfing. It has amazing pictures and some great trick tips from the two authors. A must for sailors of any level who want a decent book on the shelf!
2,Bad Twin - Bad book,"This book is for superfans of the Lost TV show only, and even then, try to get it used or borrow it from a friend. It has some interesting tie-ins with the show, but for the most part, they are just references, not clues or anything like that. Apart from its Lost allusions and Lost-related literary references, it's a pretty sorry detective novel."
3,Under Delivers,Lost fans who enjoy the tv series for it's intrigue and intelligence will be disappointed in the meager connection between the show and the book. Where the show succeeds by being clever and smart the book fails. The plot is weak and the writing style is boring. I feel taken advantage of by the Lost marketing people. This book is over priced and a time waster.
4,Mystery within a mystery,"The book was a classic who-dunit with the twist that you just KNOW it was full of clues related to the TV series LOST. I found myself wanting to take notes when names or events rung a bell. Did the ""author"" really die, or is he being held by the others? Time will only tell!"
3,Guilty Pleasure,"A guilty pleasure that is an easy read. Not Shakespeare by any means, but it does hold your interest and the pages fly by. I was hoping for more about the Hanso Foundation, but there was just enough to whet one's interest and keep one wondering if there would be more Paul Artisan adventures to follow despite the authors ""untimely demise."" It is easy to wonder if this book is trying to be more important than it really is, by referencing various literary works of consequence, but I think if you take it for what it is worth (a simple detective story designed to entertain) it will be enjoyed."
4,Good read - do not like the 'hype',"Have heard so much about this book. Thought I'd read for myself - The story is excellent - great premise, great characters and story, but I don't like being played for Hyperion's 'Lost' publicity.All the Losties will enjoy the clues and similarities to the TV series Lost.I looked up info on the Web, and the tale of the author's plane crash that he indeed is 'lost' - (in September 2004, the only crash like that was duh, in the plot of LOST the series!), the fact that Gary Troup's name is an anagram for Purgatory, that supposedly Stephen King really wrote this book (indeed it sounds like King)- mystique for the series??I have not been a regular viewer of Lost, but the book Bad Twin is an excellent read - worthy of a hardback price whatever anyone else is trying to infer!"
3,Gary Troup = Purgatory,I'm a huge fan of LOST and was hoping for a little more from the novel than a mediocre detective fiction... but one aspect which I have to love is that the fictional author's name (Gary Troup) is an anagram for Purgatory.As a hint to the true fate of those on the doomed Oceanic 815...It would certainly explain a lot.
3,OK but predictable,"Nice story, but I think the ending was very predictable - also easy to read. There are some good theories that are discussed in the book that could apply to Lost. It's neat to see all of the Hanso and Widmore references, but none of that can be verified as credible. I think it was worth the few hours that I spent to read it. I would recommend borrowing it from someone who bought it - my copy has made the rounds in my circle."
2,Average read,"Storyline wasn't very interesting or mysterious. Has nothing to do with the show ""Lost"" so don't expect to solve anything."
5,Great story,Even if your not a fan of Lost (who is at this point right?) this book is a story in its own. Great story and a really fast read.
4,"It's corny, but it's cool","Have a holly, jolly Christmas! It's classic yuletide corn, from the fellow who played Sam The Snowman on the ""Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer"" TV special. One of the most recognizable voices in 20th Century pop culture, old-school folkie Burl Ives recorded prolifically in the 1950s and '60s, but it's Christmas music he'll really be remembered for... This disc collects fifteen fine examples of his Decca Records holiday material, taken from a variety of sources... Most tracks feature prominent pop-orchestral arrangements, but Burl's rolling, grandfatherly tones cut right through the cheese every time & cheerfully draw you in. As old-fashioned Christmas material goes, this is pretty hard to beat."
1,worthless,These are worthless. The light from them is so diffuse that it does nothing to improve your vision. It's actually tough to tell the difference when they're on or off. I think they're just an appearance to make it LOOK like you've got fog lights. I only rated them 1 star because there is no 0 star option.
1,Casting the Runes Dvd,"I really enjoyed ""Night of the Demon"" with Dana Andrews so I felt enthusiastic about seeing another version.This was so bad. The leading female performer had Soap Opera instead of movie star quality. The changes that were made to the plot didn`t work. And at the end of the movie what should have been a grand finale between Karswell and the creature, was only spoken of. Not shown what had happened. This movie seemed like an insult to the classic story Casting the Runes. It`s a lesson for me to rent a movie first to see if it`s worth buying."
3,I like the songs...,"I like this cd. I really do but I just missed the songs. I know its a soundtrack but I think getting the individual cds is a better choice. I much prefer the Jhonny B Good, Power of Love, and Back in Time songs but thats just me..."
5,Awesome for cruising the beach..,Great quality can be addictive cause of catchy chorus and well written lyrics and music.. very best of Story of the year ..
2,Questionable,"Until the day i die is by far one of there best songs, but judging by the other songs there are jsut not any near that caliber on this cd. I think rather you buy this cd comes down to how much you like the band period because i dont know if the music is good enough yet"
1,"Boring, stupid rock.","I heard 'Intil the Day I Die', and I hate that song. Just look at their other song titles and they dont sound very good. This is probably a garbage cd, and since I didnt like 'Until the Day I Die', and people have said thats the best song on the cd, then I will most likely hate the other songs. Its all too boring. 'Until the Day I Die/I'll Spill My Heart for You'. I hope I never hear that song again."
4,sacred bonds,This wonderful collection of stories to read about the bond between mother's and son's.
5,I can't stop doing Sudoku,I LOVE THIS BOOK! I can't stop solving the puzzles! I just bought the 1st book and the challenge edition because I love this one so much! I'm not a big math fan at all and I have become hooked on Sudoku! The other nice thing is that each page tells you which page the answer for that puzzle is on (other kids ones make you search a bit more). Also the puzzles are a nice size and easy to make out the numbers!
1,Not New,"This was suppose to be new,and most of the pages were already filled out. It was a Christmas present. I am very disappointed as was my child."
3,Decent but not great,"Novell is in the process of running Suse into the ground. With each release of Suse, it gets worse and worse. 10.1 is buggy, particularly in its new updating architecture - Zen. I could not get it to work even after calling Novell, and talking to technical support. Sometimes my computer wouldn't shut down. It periodically froze upon bootup.But the software does have its upsides. It's loaded with third party software, and fairly easy to use and install. Never crashes. However, I still wouldn't recommend it.I finally gave up on Suse after running 10.1 for a few months. I have switched to Mandriva, and for the price of a long download ($0) it works much better."
5,great classic,I've always loved this CD. Am very glad I purchased it. This is perhaps the best R&B Christmas album of all time. Love it!
1,Not the Product Pictured,"As another reviewer stated, ""I expected to receive a pan similar to the photo displayed, with the red heat sensitive dot in the center of the pan, but it is not the same product."" The same thing happened to me. I received a completely different product."
1,no good do not buy,I cant believe this low quality of coming from an American publisher - I spend $59 for this? Tonight I will use this book to replace the paper next to my toilet. Perhaps that is the better use.
5,Thought Provoking,"Kudos to Richard and other authors like him who share such personal experiences with the world. I am reading this book for the second time and have found it to be most useful in helping me understand experiences that I've had which have been similar to his; it has become like a reference book to me. Anyone who reads this book and may be exploring consciousness and the Universe will see from this book that the possibilites are endless as the Universe is just waiting for us to explore it. Clearly as the depth of the authors' experiences show, our only limitations would be the ones that we impose upon ourselves."
5,A Must for Lovers OF Real SOul,"Gladys KNight&The Pips get Right all over this Disc.Gladys Knight can Run Circles around any of The New Jills out here.Mariah,Whitney,Mary J,Toni Braxton,etc.. Need To Go to Gladys School 101 for SOUL Classes.Nobody today can give you the feeling that she can.you feel the Warmth&Soul."
4,Undoubtedly the best game ever created.,"I first played this game when I was six years old. Now I am 16 and still play it almost every day. The game has so many wonderful sub-plots, while the whole time retaining a steady story to follow. Character customization is perfect, and the sound and grafics are wonderful. If you like RPGs, and are a fan of Final Fantasy games, this one is for you."
2,Cord Has Stopped Working,"I purchased this cord back in September 2010 and by January 2011, the cord started making a poor connection to the battery. Besides the cord being roughly 6' in length compared to the 10-12' factory cord, it now takes lots of finesse to make a connection and charge my computer. This cord wasn't even that cheap, especially since it only lasted 4 months as advertised."
3,Better than I thought....,"Alot people told me this album was crappy, but at first listen it really wasnt as bad as they'd said. Although most of the songs wont stay on your mind for too long, it's a pretty cool album. Don't pay more than 9 or 10 bucks for it though, cuz' most places have it on sale for cheaper every other week..."
3,"Pretty Good, But Gets Boring","This is, on first listen, is a pretty rad cd. The songs ""And The Hero Will Drown"", ""Until the Day I Die"", ""Anthem of Our Dying Day"" start out the record on an incredible note. Sadly, from then on in, the songs get tiresome and start to sound pretty generic. The only other exceptions come in the form of ""Sidewalks"" a really great slow one and then the amazing hardcore punk energy of the final track ""Falling Down"" kinda help redeem the album. All things considered, Story of The Year is a pretty good band, they just need to search for some creativity and originality."
2,A bit disapointing......,"Ok, I loved soty after hearing and the hero will drown, off the warped tour compilation, I thought the screaming was good and stuff, but to my dissapointment, the rest of the cd isn't solid screaming. This cd isn't very original and you can find lyrics like these basically anywhere, its a carbon-copy cd. Though some of the songs are catchy, some are just way too slow and some of the songs sound like they want to be the used, It's all been done before. So if you're looking for a refreshing new sound, don't go for soty. Check out some hopesfall if you want a good screamo band, with originality. enjoi."
1,crappy guitar mixed in with annoying vocals,"This is a ripp off of the rest of the screamo bands out there. Boring music lacking any kind of in your face guitar and "" i hear what your sayin' vocals"". To me this is pure crap, i don't know what it is with record labels wanting to pump so many of these crappy bands into the market. If you want solid listening with really cool guitar work and emotion filled lyrics, grab yourself the get-up kids or at the drive-in"
2,Meh...,"There are one or two songs which are a good listen, but this album as a whole....rather, this band as a whole is nothing special at all. Nothing new or exciting or even remotely interesting is offered with this album. If you've heard this album, you've heard it all. Story Of The Year are, sadly to say, just another reptitive emo band with contrived lyrics and forced ""passion""."
5,AMAZING,"they started out as a band called 'big blue monkey', and they have odne nothing but get a hell of a lot better... the screams arent unbearable, harmony is great... guitar riffs are simply geniusA must have for any one who like the 'Thrice' Genre"
1,Save your money!,"I purchased the Bose Companion 3 Series system about a year ago. The system worked fairly well for approximately 3 months. Since then,I've had nothing but static and sound cut outs from the system. Sometimes the music is heard without interruption, most times it's static I will add that I've checked all connections several times - it appears to have defective speaker ports on the backside. There must be better computer sound systems available, especially for the money this system costs."
2,"Not bad, but serious lack of midrange","I bought these as a small system for ambient music in the dining room.Pros:- Stylish and elegant- Build quality (feels sturdy)- Deep bass; for sure, not comparable to the 12in subwoofer in my home theater (paid 3x the price of this entire system) but still quite impressive- Does not create hearing fatigue (probably due to low distortion)Cons:- Lacks midrange; the vocals, especially for male singers, seriously lack body. Same for saxophone.So, put simply, you have a nice system, the bass drum is punchy, the highs are silky (I mean that in a good way), but Barry White sounds as if he had lost 100 pounds.Considering the relatively high price of this system, I returned it. To me, the midrange is the most important part of the spectrum. I won't sacrifice it, especially on a system of that price."
4,"If you want to know more about the benefits of Vitamin C, here is a wealth of information.","Very comprehensively written. I now want to know why it is not more widely used in treatments. If you are curious, this is a good book to read."
3,Good Product But.. High Price,This shea butter is great.. but the price is way too high.. There is another shea butter from Nature and Herb that has one more ounce and is half the price >.> I should have compared prices before i was anxious to buy..
3,Entertaining but...,It was a fun book but geared toward people who want to get into the celebrity world...it was not my kind of book... Especially since It! is a book that once you reach everything you want you will sit and think so... what next???
5,Put this book on the A-List!,"A fresh, witty and on-the-money look at the world of celebrity buzz. A quick, entertaining read that could easily become a dog-eared, often revisited favorite.Although many of the lessons taught here only fully apply once you've reached a certain level of fame/success, the principles behind them can be applied to you/your business no matter what level of success you are currently trying to reach.Froelich backs up her theories with real world anecdotes, often naming the famous names involved -- but don't worry, this book is far more than just celebrity gossip.Thanks to this book, I am re-energized and ready to push forward my career in ways I had never considered before!"
1,Not happy at all,"Very very cheap quality.. Made in china! Part of it broke off the first time i use it.. And it didn't come with the 6 disposable bags, though its written on the box that it comes with them! Wouldn't recommend it to anyone!"
1,Good for a laugh!,"I set this up in our shower tent. The legs collapsed and I fell backward. Wife came in to check on me after hearing a string of expletives. She couldn't stop laughing the rest of the day. We have since bought one of those 5-gallon plastic buckets with a custom molded seat (about $15 for both). Just use regular kitchen sized white or black plastic bags - PERFECT!! If you insist on buying the folding loo, I have one - used ONCE!"
1,You'll break it,"Unfortunately, the seat's plastic clips broke while I was sitting on it, and the situation was almost bad. While it easily provided $20 worth of entertainment, it did not last $20 worth of use."
1,The flag I was shipped was completely different than this picture,"I was dissapointed with my first purchasing experience on Amazon. The first time I tried to complete my order it was not processed correctly. Then when I actually placed a succesfull order, the product I received was totally different from the representative picture on the web site"
3,Worth Reading,"This book does not really live up to the promise of its title, as it never really explores to any great extent the ""pleasures of death,"" but it is a decent introduction to Lacanian ideas. Ragland never leaves the professor mode of explanation and enlightenment, and her style is hampered by her reluctance to drop her position of mastery, but she nevertheless manages to convey some concepts that may provoke further thinking."
2,I expected something better,"The CD arrived on time and in good conditions, but the sound track was very poor."
5,Herbal remedies for maintaining health,"From babies to the elderly Penelope Ody addresses the seven stages of life and how to care for ourselves at each one. Her emphasis is on taking charge of one's own day to day health. She teaches us how to make and use syrups, infusions, decoctions, tinctures, tonic wines, capsules, compresses, poultices, hot and cold infused oils, massage oils, ointments, creams, lotions, emulsions, eyewashes, mouthwashes and more. There are full color photos of how she makes these as well as of the plants she uses. There is a remedies for common aliments section that lists the herbs used for specific problems and which way of using it is preferable. I am sure when Shakespeare wrote of the seven ages of man he had no idea how stressful life would be in the 21st century and how necessary health maintenance would be. Penelope Ody has it figured out though. Thank Goodness."
2,Say it ain't so...,"I loved these cups when I first got them. They are the perfect size, weight, color, etc. Just one thing....mine eventually cracked- little cracks you might not see at first until the cup starts leaking. When I say eventually, I mean I didn't even get one year of use out of them! I put mine in the top rack of the dishwasher like it says you can, but they still cracked. I had read some reviews that warned of this defect, but I bought them anyway because I just loved them. I have to admit it though, it was a mistake to buy them."
3,Outdated but good....,"This book started the connection between food additives but it outdated now due to the availability of organic and gluten free food. Great book but for an updated and easier to read book, I highly recommend ""What's eating your child""."
2,Some good Info.,"The book was well written & provided several possibilities which I did research further with my son. It's not the best book on child behavior I have read, but it is ok."
5,an awesome toy!,this model is very cool it is fun to build and even though its a model it can fall on the floor when it is knocked out of you hand and a piece might fall off but it is easy to fix. i would reccomend this toy for ages 8-12
2,crap,this modle is junk.the first day i bought it it broke.if you try to open the chest plait it will come off.you cant really do any good poses for it and it looks lame.LATA
3,I thought it was good,"I thought this would be a nice model. However, the pieces started to break and my friend doesn't know the meanging of ""fragile"""
5,HeavyArms,As an expierienced prof. collector i highly recommend this extremely fun and interactive to all kids over 6.
3,Just OK.,"I really did not have that much time to study for my Praxis II Language Arts...really only a couple of weeks. I bought this to help me study. Book is just ok. Does not cover everything on the test & those topics it does cover are not too thoroughly covered or well organized.I ended up doing very well on the test (got a special certficate and all), but in little part due to studying with this.You can try to use this (there isn't much else out there other than the for purchase Praxis guides which I did not use)...practice tests in the Cliff's book were the most helpful thing about the book.What really helped me get prepared for taking the test was using the free Praxis guide on the Praxis website as a study guide & just doing research on those topics on my own."
2,Full of errors,"I bought this book to help me review for the Praxis II English Content Knowledge Exam (0041). The book gives some good information about the types of exam questions and the scoring, but the practice test is terrible. There are many, many errors. A Langston Hughes poem is misnamed, various texts are misquoted, the meter of at least one poem is misidentified (Frost's ""The Road Not Taken"" is iambic tetrameter, not iambic pentameter), punctuation rules are misidentified, and so on. Also, many of the questions/answer choices are so badly worded that it scares me to death: Is the actual Praxis going to be so badly written, or is this prep book not representative? In short: If you're taking the 0041, I recommend this only for the info at the front. The practice test is infuriating. I will update this review after I take the 0041, to say how the phrasing of the questions/answer choices compared to that of this practice test."
2,Uninformed and Incorrect,"I would never recommend this book and am very sorry that I bought it instead of the official ETS publication. I'm actually so upset about that I may write an email to the author herself. Diane Kern's information throughout the book is often completely wrong and is sometimes contradictory. The questions on the practice tests are terribly written and the answers, again, are often wrong. There's no way to score your practice test after you take it. Kern seems to be uninformed about current thinking in academia and education in general. Not everything is wrong, and I did find what was correct to be helpful, but I don't think it's worth the hassle of constantly wondering whether or not the information presented is correct. The practice tests are completely useless. My advice is to order the official study guides from the ETS website. I haven't personally used them, but they have to be better than this. Whatever you decide to do, DON'T buy this book."
2,poor structure,I purchased this study guide to practice for my Praxis 0041 and other English content tests and I was soon frustrated with the basic format of the guide. None of the chapters were marked but a constant reference was made to them. I also found many answers in the practice tests wrong. I signed on to Amazon reviews to see if I was the only one to feel this way and I was relieved to see others experiencing the same frustrations. Study guides should absolutely be more accurate!!
4,Beware: Easier than the test!,"I took the middle school language arts test. This study guide was helpful in some areas, but the practice test was way easier than the real test itself. I also bought the ETS study guide which was better in terms of how hard the questions were going to be. i don't either are perfect though. This gives you more information - like reviewing terminology and grammar and stuff but the practice test was not very helpful. It didn't even have the evaluating a student's writing test question which is definitely part of the actual test! The ETS guide gave you no helpful overall review but the questions were so much more real. The test has a lot of reading passages and then answering questions, so be prepped for a lot of reading on the test. Grammar is definitely covered a decent amount as well - the test people I think underplay how much grammar is on the test. Anyways, good luck with whatever you choose!"
2,"Good questions, Not answers","The practice test itself was pretty good. But some of the test answers are wrong. For example: a sonnet is written in iambic pentameter, and therefor has 10 syllable per line, NOT 14!"
2,Rickety and wobbly... fell off the window after 3 days!,"This bird feeder was pretty cheap, but I guess you get what you pay for! It's very light weight and didn't stick to the window very well from the beginning... then fell off (and broke) after only a few days. Better to spend a little more and get a better quality feeder that will last!"
4,bird feeder,"the product is very good.........I'm enjoying the birds coming to feed. I had some difficulty putting it together, believe it or not and wish there had been some instructions."
1,Don't buy!,"Mine also fell within an hour of putting it up and broke - I was so disappointed; it was my Mother's Day gift that I picked out and while I love the look of it and even the color, it's flimsy and wouldn't hold the weight of the bird seed."
4,Great for little birds,Only drawback is how the birds can drop seed from the feeder all over the deck as there is no type of tray or catch basin. Easy to fill and the suction cups work well.
5,Nice Collection of Unique Christmas Music,"Always admired Louis Armstrong as a ""Great American Musician"" who even with his fame and fortune still remained grounded! This disc also contains Eartha Kitt and Lena Horne.....two more great voices as well as others. Love It!!"
3,Good value with some problems,The set (impact driver plus drill) is an unbeatable value.I give the impact driver 5 stars.Light weight. Works great. Battery lasts a long time (far longer than in the drill). The belt clip is a great thing to haveI give the drill 2 stars (even though it was basically free with the kit)Low battery life. Chuck is garbage (can't hold anything other than a hex shank bit). Round bits slip like crazy. A belt clip would be a nice addition. I tested the ruggedness of this drill twice. I dropped it over 8 feet on to concrete and it came through with flying colors.
4,Not Bad,"No real big complaints here, except it was later than I had expected. Besides that, good seller, no problems with the product."
5,Great Combo,New batteries are powerful. I appreiciate the torque of the 1/2 inch drive drill motor. I've used the shop light many times.
5,Pure RPG in this Game's Veins!,This Game is really good. It may be on Gameboy but it rocks!! Its almost like a Mini FFIX!! I recommend that you buy it! The Graphics and pictures are good and the story is simply amazing. You like RPG's?? Got Gameboy?? Buy this!!
5,Family Friendly Gem of a Movie. A MUST See!,"Please please please don't go by the editorial review of this movie. As you can see, everyone that has posted a review about it has loved it! You'll laugh, you'll cry and you'll laugh some more! This movie has some of the funniest lines I've ever heard! Ex.) Father to younger son over the phone ""Your mother loves you. Maybe the most. I myself think you're going to end up in a penitentiary within the year; but that's my humble opinion. What do I know?"" If you have not already seen it, please don't let anymore time go by. You'll love it! I can't wait for it to come out on DVD!"
4,Great from start to finish ! Now on DVD,"I have been waiting for some time for this movie to come out on DVD and finally it has. It is a fantastic story that just keeps on bounding alone. There are no flat spots in the show and many memorable moments. As many others have mentioned the ""Louie Louie"" scene is classic and the scenes with the uncle and the boys are highlights.I absolutley love the Father in this movie, his legacy with the stop sign is classic. All of the blues and carry on are hilarious and the eventual brotherly love that rises to the top will tug a little at the heart strings.I would be staggered to think someone would sit through this film and not walk out at the end with a great feeling inside and a huge smile on thier face."
5,One of my most favorite childhood books,"Love the story as always, loved this volume. The artwork is so cute and so much fun for both adults and children."
1,Sting has turned into a Michael Bolton w/o the hair,"Musically, this is deplorable for a has been talent as Sting. Lyrically, it's so weak, we thought this was a comedy album.Sting, time to retire? Please give it some thought and save your legacy my friend."
4,The best Sting album in 10 years!,"There is no comparison to the last couple of trash albums ... Sacred Love is the best one. Not everybody will enjoy this (as the reviews here show), but it's nonetheless quite good.There are a couple of not so good songs here ... so what? Every album has songs like that on them. Iwas never as much a fan of Sting's work vs. the Police, however that is now changing.Send Your Love may very well be the best solo Sting song ever ... it's absolutely amazing!Just give it a chance ... whether you like it or not, the Sting will not last forever if you don't care for it."
1,Fields Of Mold,"He crossed the border from pompous reggae-influenced pop/punk with the Police [a great thing] to pompous ersatz pap-meister solo [a very bad thing], menacing us for nearly 2 decades with quasi-rock/jazz that lite-radio dreams are made of. Don't mistake this for art - take it for what it is - a monopoly on a radio format w/a larger than cult following. More tuneless, wan and monotonous than usual...perfect fodder for the VH1 votary. My grade: C-"
1,Disappointed!!!,"I love Sting's work, but this album's songs were not up to his usual brilliance. Adding a tired voice like Mary J Bilge just shows a desire to try to pull in an audience that normally wouldn't buy his stuff. This is the first album of his that I actually stopped playing. Sad."
3,Get the book instead,"This is probably one of the two albums from Sting that left me disappointed. He is really one of my all time favorite singers and songwriters. But, much like his other serious misstep, ""Mercury Falling,"" the material here sounds not fully realized, and he spends too much time referencing other work. If I wanted to hear ""We'll Be Together"" or ""Walking In Your Footsteps"" I'd go to the originals. Aside from ""Stolen Car,"" ""The Book Of My Life"" and ""Send Your Love,"" not much is memorable as far as songs are concerned. In fact, the disc's opener ""Inside"" is little more than an irritatingly sung list of phrases, enough to start the album on a harsh note, and the pointless remix of ""Send Your Love"" ends the disc with a thud. My advice, get Sting's ""Broken Music"" book instead."
3,"A nice cd, not one of his best","I can tell by some of the reviews...a new Sting CD will certainly generate a lot of opinions. I must disagree with some of the reviewers who said Sting has become boring with age. The man is 52 years old...what do you expect! Sting is extremely wealthy and lives a totally different lifestyle than he did 25-30 years ago and his music will reflect those changes. One of the reasons, I've always like Sting is because he has continued to grow and evolve as a musician and not be afraid to take chances with his music. Now, with all that said..this is a nice CD! It's not one of his best, but there are several songs that display Sting's strength, songwriting. ""The Book of My Life"" and ""Forget about the Future"" are those tunes. I have listen to the CD several times and the other songs will evenutally grow on me. ""Sacred Love"" is a mixed bag, but I will let Sting slide because of all the great music he has given us over the years."
1,Insert sound of vomiting here,"Could ""Sting"" be any more of a self-absorbed jerk? Has there been a single awards show, sporting event, or other overwrought extravaganza in recent years where he hasn't shown up to put in yet another insufferable performance? Those questions are rhetorical, by the way..."
4,Well Done,"A long time between drinks but worth the waitTypical Sting to try some new styles some successfully some not - the rap and hip hop elements can be dispensed with - you are far too good to drop to that level or think that you will attract a new market - that market will not appreciate the rest of the CDI love ""Stolen Car"" and just keep listening to it - ""The Book of my Life"" another strong track with the other highlights for me being ""Inside"" and ""Whenever I say your name""Whilst I do not have any musical talent myself I do know what I enjoy and Sting has produced another CD that a fan like myself can sit down listen to, enjoy and appreciate the the passion behind the music - well done Sting"
2,A bit disappointing...,"Sting has always gave me at least four or five memorable songs per album, which isn't the case on Sacred Love. I've given it about five listens and it all seems uninspired and forced. The songs predictable and boring. Though not a total loss with songs like ""Inside"" and ""The book of my life"". But I just cant seem to get past cliché album title and song names. Send your Love? Is this a Yanni inspired title?I still love you Sting but you lost your perspective on this one.Still better than a punch in the neck!!!"
4,"Four stars, certainly...","Why is one star lacking? Because: The original version of ""Send your love"" is much better than its disco-remix... And without any doubt, the remix of ""Shape of my heart"" can never take the place of its original... I want to ask Mr.Sumner why he doesn't make a remix of ""An Englishman in New York"" for example... Songs that hit people right from the centre of their hearts shouldn't be changed this way or that way, I think... Am I wrong?"
5,Back to Basics,"After having been somewhat disappointed by Mercury Falling and very disappointed in Brand New Day, I like the fact that Sting went back to his basics just a little bit in this album. The mix of smooth Jazz and Techno-pop is just right. His story telling is amazing and draws you in deeper. Mary J. Blidge is a sweet treat as well. All I can say is ""Yay! No country twangy songs!"" I think this may be my new favorite album."
2,A Little Too Different,"I have been a relatively ardent fan of Sting's music. I'm especially fond of the jazzier tunes from his earlier albums, as well as some of his experiments with country music. It's always good to (rarely) see a musician who adapts to change, who doesn't grow stale by performing the same old jargon. However, while I appreciate an artist who tries to be different on each album, I think he goes a bit far.I don't know if he is desparately trying to fight the fact that he's ageing by staying current in his musical styles, or what. He kinda reminds me of the parent who tries a little too hard to relate to his kids by dressing and acting like them. It's admirable that he's trying to relate to his fans by staying current...but it is a tad pathetic."
2,on s'attend à plus de Sting,"Secret Love est un album que Sting a créé immédiatement après les attentats du 11 septembre 2001, l'inspiration de cette tragédie peut s'entendre sur plusieurs chansons. Il y a bien les ""Dead man's rope"" et ""Never coming home"" qui sont musicallement intéressante, mais pour le reste c'est très ordinaire pour ne pas dire totalement ""platte"". L'album a été écrit, produit et enregistré en un temps record, mais je préfèrerait plutt voir Sting prendre un petit break car la qualité a laquelle il nous a habitué n'est plus au rendez-vous. Je donne 2 étoiles seulement."
2,Bad choice for collaboration,"I have always admired Sting for his strong sense of style, and for his willingness to explore new arenas, but MJB is FLAT! Sting, how could you allow such a thing!"
3,It is cool and all for what it is and all.,"I don't like the way monkeys are portrayed in these Photographs. I have been a collector of monkey ephemera for one a half decades. This curious collection comes out of a desire to understand our simian cousins. I have yet to understand them. Anyway, this book gives a really misrepresented picture of what it is like to have a pet monkey. Come on! Monkeys don't go the rock shows by do-gooder rap stars. They like Willie Nelson. Then the picture of the guy petting his pet monkey at the end. It is as though the author is trying to make up for the rest of the book. I didn't see any pictures of iron birds, either."
3,Plenty of fun if you're Patient!,"I don't know why this toy is getting such bad reviews. The Gameboy version is much better than the original toy! If you're patient enough to nurture your little pets, they'll grow into creatures that are energetic and willing to please. Once they mature, they don't become sick as easily, and become better at the games. In short, this game is not for those who like lots of action. If you have lots of time on your hands and don't mind having to wait, (there's a speed time option, to wake your pets early if you like) this game is a great way to pass the time."
2,Too complicated,"The book is extremely well written. However, I had a hard time understanding everything because of the medical words being used."
1,not helpful,I don't believe in writing negative reviews unless they're really useful. I ordered this book based on all the good things I'd read about it. As I read it I wondered if these reviewers had read the same book! It's a dense and not terribly readable listing of all the readily researched material on CFS and fibromyalgia. Nothing in it is helpful.
1,havent got it yet...!!!!!!!,"i would give a review if i could get the damn thing. downloaded everything,the player whole nine yards and it wont let me download....says i dont have a recent order to down load. bunch of crap and cant get anyone at amazon to help....waste of 10 bucks...yeah im pissed!"
5,This is an AWESOME game,"This is a great action/puzzle game. A little pokémon style if you've never played zelda games, but way better. the story line could use a little work, but other than that it's pretty much the perfect RPG."
3,Embarrassing First Impression,"I became interested in this book through reading another book by one of the contributors, D. Brent Sandy--Plowshares & Pruning Hooks: Rethinking the Language of Biblical Prophecy and Apocalyptic. The dictionary certainly has a wealth of information from an impressive array of scholars, and I have already gained insight from its entries. But its first impression left me embarrassed for the publisher and author of the Introduction. On page xxi, the author states that ""Gideon's mother"" received an ""annunciation of birth."" It was, of course, Samson's mother (Judges 13). Readers expect that a scholarly work of this sort would at least be accurate in basic biblical facts."
4,Great Book for anyone seeking more spiritual revelation,Yes this book took some time arriving at my house but the book is great for dreamers and people who have visions and for anybody desiring to get spiritual insight and revelation about certain things in the world and the Bible. This book will give you great elaborative Bible study and awesome spiritual insight!!
1,incorrect!,"This isn't the ""best of"" Caetano, at all!It's just a miscelaning selection of almost unknown songs of Caetano Veloso.For a ""best of Caetano"" with much more accuracy, you can try ""Sem Leno, Sem Documento"""
2,The Best of Caetano Veloso,"The song selection on this CD had very limited variety. It was a disappointing selection, to say the least. I had expectations that his music would be much more interesting - but it lacked depth and was a poor choice on my part. Dale Brookins"
2,Music better than disc allows,"The uncredited score by Giuseppe Becce & Bernhard Kaun from the original ""Frankenstein"" film, Waxman's ""The Bride of Frankenstein"" and Skinner's ""The Son of Frankenstein"" are presumably at the center of this recording. However, the use of dialogue and sound effects, though usually separated from the score, is extremely bothersome on repeat listening. The music is better than this release allows. If one wants the music with sound effects & dialogue, get the films themselves."
4,A straightforward shower of sales advice,"Sales pro Jeffrey J. Fox's book is informative, inspirational, short and easy to read - a powerful package for sales professionals or sales managers, particularly those who need to build expertise and experience. Fox focuses on how a determined sales representative can transform himself or herself into a ""Rainmaker,"" an unbeatable, successful salesperson. Each chapter contains a central idea, such as how to get a sale, how to get an appointment or how to present proposals. Short examples scattered throughout the book show how real rainmakers earned their stripes. This accessible book should be part of any salesperson's background or refresher reading list. We also recommend this book to sales managers and trainers, and to staffers who meets customers on the front lines. After all, everyone wants to know how to make it rain."
5,Huge Tetris Fan,"This is a great game to add to your collection, if you're a big Tetris fan, but too bad this game isn't in color."
3,Big Board Game Fan,"This is a good game and all, but it wasn't very chalenging, but i give it a 3 stars, if you're a beginer on these board games"
3,Arrangements range from smooth jazz to soundtrack style - Good but a little too slick,"Vanessa's distinctive sound is that it is well cultivated,a beautiful tone, perfect articulation, like a polished pearl.However sometimes these arrangements seem a little artificial,sometimes obviously Kenny G, or George Benson, (I'll Be Homefor Christmas) or like it was pulled from the soundtrack ofThe Lion King (Do You Hear What I Hear. Sometimes her vocalphrasing sounds too much like she is borrowing from Al Jarreau,while the band sounds like studio musicians who have used thesame riffs over and over on other album projects.I do like her rendition of ""What Child Is This"", ""The FirstNoel"", and her tastefully jazzy ""Angels We Have Heard OnHigh"". These arrangements are fresh and interesting all theway through.Overall this is still a pleasant album, though I would liketo have heard Vanessa challenge herself more, on range andinterpretation."
5,vanessa williams christmas collection,Beautiful! Vanessa puts such heart and soul in all of her songs. That is especially true in this Christmas collection. Beautiful music for a beautiful season.
4,"It's called battle ship, not super battle ship!","It is very fun, but the computer cheats by using weapons you don't have and by almost always hitting you every time it's its turn. It's still a good buy for a collector or if you just like battle ship in general."
5,a must have Christmas cd for me!,"what can i say? if you like the oakridge boys, this Christmas cd is wonderful. i have this on an LP. i've been looking for years for this on a cd. the oakridge boys' voices are just perfect for Christmas songs!"
3,disappointed,"Although the plot and main character had promise, the book really couldn't make up its mind about what it was trying to be-- a romance, a suspense novel, or a book about a woman who was way more introspective than decisive. The romance was thin, the suspense not very suspenseful, most of the secondary characters stereotypical and predictable, the introspection immature, the ending melodramatic. Molly's vocabulary and speech patterns were too adult to be believable in a five-year-old, although I loved her role in the denouement and found it to be age appropriate. Once she stopped her eternal scampering, the child could make a difference. When Zoe did step up and take action, it seemed inconsistent with her previously established character. Jones does have a nice writing style, and demonstrates her ability to think up a good plot. It is particularly disappointing to spend time with a book and realize that the author was capable of doing better."
3,"Conceited, but inspiring","I do not like Michael Bloomberg's politics, but I respect him as a business leader. His information terminal has revolutionized the financial services industry, and it is always nice to see an American success story.I bought my book at a discount place, and I am glad I did. It wasn't boring, but it didn't knock my socks off."
3,I love Mayor Mike,"I'm a huge Mike Bloomberg fan, and really enjoyed the autobiographical parts of this novel and the story of his company's genesis. The generic computer stuff I could have done without, also the story didn't really flow and was a bit choppy. Overall a good, quick easy read. But I definitely could've used some more Bloomberg, Mike that is.Unfortunately there is surprisingly very little written about this great man."
1,Not satisified with your ads,"I ordered the Elimination Chamber and the ad said The Chamber and 2 figures included. When I received it there were no figures and on the box said figures sold seperatly. When I went back into your ad, it then said figures sold seperatly. Had I know there were no figures included I could have been prepared but I didn't open the box until Christmas Eve to wrap it and it is now a little late to go and find the figures. I will not be ordering from this site again, your advertisment was false as far as I am concerned."
4,Worked smoothly right out of the box; very easy to set up,"A slick looking but pricy Apple product. Despite numerous negative reviews on the Apple forums, the USB device functioned without a hitch and was far easier to install than on a Windows machine. Good download speed. I was thankful to Apple Forum reviewers for advice to locate the modem well away from magnetic sources (poor shielding perhaps?). Seems slow to start and stop, aggravated by the lack of audible clues of dialup phone connection.Tops in my hands at least, but others have had less than stellar results."
3,"easy install, easy setup, slow to negotiate connection, crashed my Mac.","I purchased this item to use with my 15"" MacBook Pro while traveling in Brazil. Installation was effortless; MacOS 10.5.2 automatically added it as a network interface. Configuration was similar: Simply enter the username, password, phone number. Initially I had issues with the connection dropping every 5-7 mins, and Aqua would freeze, requiring a hard reboot. Searching on Apple's website (in 5-7 minute blocks) yielded many people complaining of the same problem. I tried a number of solutions, including changing USB ports, unplugging the power, changing phone cables, etc. Some combination of these (I don't recall exactly which, but I think it was ""unplug power and use USB port next to the power connector"") resolved the issue and I was able to connect for several hours without problem."
5,my husband loves it!,"Since I'm not the ""gamer"" in the household, I can't say for myself, but my husband says it's one of the best hunting games he's played. The graphics aren't the best there is, but they are relatively realistic, as is the game play (you don't just hunt, the animals can turn on you). I enjoy watching him play!"
1,Worst game I've ever purchased,The concept of this game is terrific. The execution is someting else entirely. The controls are stupifyingly bad. It is nearly impossible to control the gun and aim. For some reason the games creators didn't think it important for a hunter to be able to control his or her's gun. You can get dizzy from this. The camera just goes round and round. You can never see the animal sneaking up on you. It's even difficult to see the animal when they're attacking you. I would really like a good hunting game. Let me know when someone makes one. This certainly isn't it.
1,Hunting meets Halo.,"First off let me say anyone whos ever been on any kind of hunting trip or knows anything about hunting at all will bash their system with a sledge hammer after playing this game. I can understand being attacked by a Grizzly Bear or a Mountain Lion but White Tail Deer?!? Come on! Why equip yourself with any hunting gear we all you have to do is buy every tag, haul arse thru the woods, and shoot the first thing that attacks you. Be sure your carrying something fully automatic though cause you need it to hit the animal. Alot of ppl are defending this game saying its fun to mow down animals that attack you. It only takes one shot to kill them. Yippy, one shot....after running thru a straight valley for 10 minutes that you cant get out of. Might be different if your ran into 50 Rhinos and you had a Stinger missle launcher or something. To anyone whos thinking of buying this game, DON'T. It sucks in almost every way possible."
5,A wonderful book,"There's really a lot to appreciate about this book, and there was useful info right off the bat. Of course the first 20 minutes I spent looking at all the pretty pictures, espcially the ones that seperate the chapters.The biggest difference between this book and others is the ""tone"" (if there is such a thing) that the information is presented in. Some How-to's are all stupid and jokey and others read like a thesis on grass growing. This is informal and smart, enjoyable to read.So far, I've used the 'drawing a straight line without a a ruler, shadows and textures on rocks and rubble and flowing robes. Don't get me wrong, I was confident in tackling these things on my own, but after reading Fantastic Relams, I was able to create these items more dyanamically than before.Also, digging the templates for practice and the coloring keys throughout the book."
3,Leprechaun double feature,This DVD was a birthday gift for my nephew. I received it in plenty of time...and he LOVED IT!!!!
3,A Better Idea...,"Although the first 5 tracks are classic songs that are a delight to hear, the other five are nothing special. If you really like Frankie's music it would be a much better investment to purchase the album titled ""Very Best of Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons."" For just a couple dollars more you'll get all the favorites this album offers plus many he did with the Four Seasons (think: Walk Like a Man, Big Girls Don't Cry, etc). That one is a five star, but this one only gets three."
4,Great camera for biginners,Do you have a pocket PC? Than you can use it to transfer photos from the camera to your desktop much faster!!
5,"Great, Easy, Fun",This camera is ready right out of the box. Easy to use. The software is also easy to install and use.Don't forget about the $30 rebate!Hard to pass this one up!
3,Good Basic Camera,"This camera is to the Digital Camera realm what the old 126's were to portable cameras back in the days. If you remember 110 cameras, these were the most portable, but the pix were not great. 126's had a good pic and were reasonably portable. (Remember the box of Flash Cubes) The DC3200 camera gives a very nice 4""X6"" picture. But, If you don't use the flash, you will tend to get fuzzy pics if you are not steady. The camera shot also occurs about 1/2 a second after you press the shutter release. This takes some getting used to, but it's not a great disincentive considering you can shoot around 400 pix at the best resolution with a 128Mb CF. Download these to you PC and pick the good ones for developing. I get my pix done as 4""X6""s and they look great."
3,excellent pictures but slow,"Great feel and fit, but the lack of a usb port makes transfers painfully slow and the purchase of an extra memory oushes the price up to some better buys."
3,Well written history with a fatal technical flaw,"Well written, easy to read full of information and some informative maps. But it has a fatal flaw. The author for some reason insists on using modern military and naval terms instead of the appropriate roman terminology. This has two fatal results. 1) The uninitiated reader can fail to understand the critical differences between roman and modern organization and operations 2) The experienced reader has an overwhelming sense of being talked down to. Though the author might be forgiven for wanting to make Roman History more accessible, the editor cannot be forgiven for allowing this horrible horrible misstep and badly misunderstanding their audience. Because honestly no reader with only a mild interest in Rome is going to pick up a book like this one. Unfortunately this makes the book unreadable. I can only use it as a reference to look up information but I am unable to pick it up and read it for more than 15min at a time."
1,Avoid this Book and Author,Avoid any book by this author. They are terrible. They do not give you a historically accurate picture of the legions. Dando-Collins believes he makes his book more readible by using modern military ranks -- but alas he is truly ignorant of Roman History if he things calling a Legate a General or Brigadier General conveys the accuracy of what a Legate's duties were in the Roman Military. He just muddles the picture. I suspect he does not truly understand the actual function of many of these Roman military titles and by using modern equivalents he loses all sense of how the Roman Army was built and how it functioned. It is sad that someone actually published this garbage.
1,Waste of Time and Effort,This book is another waste of time and effort by Dando-Collins; don't bother buying it. It is a mixture of facts and pseudo-history all of which has been blended for maximum effect. The publisher should be held accountable for publishing it. The only redeeming feature of this book is that once you finish it you will never have to read another book by this guy. Put your efforts into seeking out more accurate studies.
2,What's with the pastels?,"I am a Martha Stewart fan, but this book disturbed me with its creepy pastels and white motif that pervaded the book. This sucked the Christmas spirit right out of me. I do yearn for the deep rich colors and and old money feel that were the Martha of yore. Now everything is post-divorce bright minimalist."
2,Did anyone test this toy out?,"My 2 year old son was so excited to get this toy, he couldn't wait for Daddy to put it together. Well, no sooner had we put it together when the stick shift had cracked and broken off. Another toy to add to the junk pile! Don't waste your time on this one."
5,Fun But Easily Broken,"I bought this toy for my 2 1/2 year old for Christmas. He loved it--still does. However, it's now May and the steering wheel came off the bars a couple of weeks ago. All other elements work. The gear shift handle coming off was not a problem as my son learned that being too rough caused this problem and became more gentle with that part. He would pretend he was driving over rough terrain and rock the ""car"" alot and that eventually led to the steering wheel breaking. We tried to use super glue to put it back together. It worked until my son began playing with it again. He's devastated by it being broken. All the parts work, except that the wheel cannot sit on it anymore. It's so fun for him, I'm thinking of trying it one more time and asking him to be gentler with the steering wheel like he's learned to be with the gear shift handle."
3,"It's ok, not what I expected","The toy is ok. If you read most reviews you will notice that it was bought mostly for 1 or 2 year old toddlers. I would not recommend this toy for any child older than two. It really was not what I expected. For a baby, this toy is good and I would say it's pretty durable, just make sure you pull the seat way up for them to reach the pedal. It did not seem to catch the attention of my little one very long. I guess I did not read the description when buying this. I assumed the screen with the car was electronic like a video game when driving, however it is just paper with a car that goes from side to side. If you're fine with that then I think you'll enjoy it. As a stated for a baby this is good.The horn has sound to it as well as the pedals."
2,VB Scripters Move On,"This book has a lot of fancy Java Script, but to those of us who refuse to write anything compatible with Netscrape (in other words, us VB Scripters), this book is difficult to read. You have to translate the miles of JScript into VB Script. Not much fun. VI Web Technologies reference is a useful daily reference, as well as MSDN Scripting Technologies web site."
1,Wouldn't let the washer work,"I have a Kenmore Elite HE3 washer and these hoses would not let it work. The washer kept getting ""Water Inlet Problem"" every time I tried to start a cycle. Once I put the old hoses back on, the machine worked fine. They seem like a good idea and will probably work great on other machines but not mine."
1,these should be called wash proof!,I bought these and they worked fine for a while then i moved and reconnected the hoses and they do not work at all. our new house has very high water pressure since it's directly below the city water supply. this high pressure activated the flood safe valve and it will not reset no matter what. if you get these to work the first time don't ever increase the water pressure or you may be making that long trip to the hardware store. i'm going with braided hose without the tricky valves in them.
5,It's the best FrontPage book ever written!,"I have bought 5-6 FrontPage books including the ones published by Microsoft Press. However none of them ever came closer to the Dummies on the earth as this one. The author claimed she was not a techno wizard -- probably that's why she knows what can not be left out to an ordinary reader like you and me. Lots lots lots PRACTICAL advices in the book that you can never find in other similar titles. If you wanna really learn FrontPage, this is the best one and the only one bible you need, forget about other books!"
3,Doors don't stay on,"Doors don't stay on. Barbie's voice can get very annoying. I like the music, but I had to turn off the voice/music function because it's very obnoxious.Just the right size for a space in our living room. Storage place for some food and dishes, but not a lot."
1,Poor build quality -- Terminal sockets pull out,Bought this to power a Sound Devices 744T audio recorder. The sockets pulled out of the battery the first time I unmounted it from the pins on the recorder. My email to the manufacturer got no reply. Returned to Amazon for a refund.
2,"Read Melville, Conrad or `A Perfect Storm' Instead.","Given the hype over the book, I expected much more by way of chracter depth, authentic detail of fishing vessels and the lifestyle of fishers. This book was a rare atttempt to capture all those things, and it does aim to do so. But it falls short - the female characters especially. And it bores. Too bad, another good edit and rewrite and he could have had something special. As it is, this fish floats dead to the surface and stinks."
1,spartina muck,Having grown up in Rhode Island I was initially fascinated by many familiar references and the development of the main character. But then gradually the story became infinitely less interesting for a variety of reasons. It is unfortunate as it had great potential but seemingly got as lost as a worm in spartina muck.
4,Magical Device,"I must review this order because as soon as the delivery guy handed it to me I noticed some unpleasant issues. It as shipped in it's original box that was all beat up and damaged. Usually amazon would put the item and its box in another box for safer transit. I don't know what happened with this one. When I turned on the unit it malfunctioned; the screen went blank and the LED's on the input A and output 1 just kept blinking. I had to tap it with my hand for it to come back on. It does this in the middle of gigs too. I am very disappointed with amazon with this order. Can't know who to blame for the malfunction!!! However, I am rating the unit 4 stars out of 5 because when it is working it is great to operate and makes the cheapest of speakers sound amazing."
5,best book ever,it would be the best vap movie ever its so well set its ready to go.i have read it 5 time and still rad it again if i had it
1,I wouldnt waste a splinter of wood on these vampires.,"Ho-hum, thats what I thought about this book. I have read McCammon before and wasnt all that impressed but thought I would give this a try because I love vampire novels. It started out really well,peaked my interest, then it slowed down with all the introductions of all the different characters, the cop, the thug, the reporter, the lowlife, the pregnant teenager,In other words the regular lineup for these types of books. I was waiting for something to happen, for it to be creepy or dramatic, or even to just make me want to keep reading it, and NOTHING HAPPENED> some grave robbing (yawn) a serial killer (stretch) the ghost of a mother long dead (yawn, and stretch) at that point I would have been happy if Count Chocula came out and made everyone breakfast, but he didnt. So I put the book down and started on another vampire novel."
4,"Superb, but there could be more than just exclusive secrets","Pros:Superb GraphicsPlenty of modesGreat extrasGreat gameplaygood voice actingbeautiful 3D arenasThe wemon, can't 4git themTag mode is better than Tekken's cuz u fight till the last man is outnice replay valueEasily one of the best fighting games avalibleCons:So-So musicWhen u hit with a powerful move, sounds like a buildin fallin, pretty unrealistic sound effectsStory mode pretty much makes no senceWish it had a end movie gallery like TekkenOnly 14 characters? That ain't all that muchIt's a port, with more extras, but all the cons could have been improved(well I dunno bout story mode, but everything else could'ave been improved). Still, this is a game that should be own by all fighting fans with a PS2."
1,Faulty Disk?,"I haven't played this game in years, so I figured it'd be a nice novelty buy. When it arrived, I was ecstatic. However, after putting the game in the system, I was not. The game didn't work at all. Like, it's about 4% playable. VERY Disappointed."
2,NOT VERY FUN,This game brings you about 1 hour of fun before you get sick of it. All the levels are more or less the same. I would not recommend wasting your money on this.
2,Very Challenging But To Repetitive,As we all know the point of this game is to get the frog from point A to point B without getting killed by cars or water. The game has good graphics but there are some things I did not like. For example I didn't like the fact that on level three on the game it was impossible to avoid the super fast cars and throughout the whole game you are times. Anyway only if you love frogger get this game.
5,Pleasantly surprised,"When i first began to assemble the hoop at the bottom of the net I found it a bit tedius, but as I became more familiar with the process i was more successful. Two people could do it more easily: one to push the hoop though and one to bend it to the shape of the bottom hem. That would prevent it from getting hung up due to the circular path it had to take.Once put together, however, this turned out to be a great value in my opinion. The net is sturdy, and the design is very reliable. Staked down, weighted down, the net is very secure, even during windstorms. The netting itself, endured a rosebush's thorns slammed into it by a nor'easter. I carefully plucked the thorns out of the net and was pleased to see no holes at all.Very happy with this product."
2,Horribly ugly,We ordered this hoping it would allow us to sit on our back porch during spring and summer. It was so ugly that we had to return it.
1,BEWARE,I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT AT BEST BUY I WOULD NOT SUGGEST THIS TO ANYONE. I HAD TO REPLACE 2 OF THESE WITH NETGEAR AND THE CUSTOMER SUPPORT IS REALLY FRUSTRATING BECAUSE THERE FROM ANOTHER COUNTRY. DO NOT BUY.
3,Creeps me out 25 years later,"I loved the Mushroom Planet books but my memories of this one are entirely different. I haven't read it since I was a kid but it has probably shaped my fascination for weird fiction, of stories about what might happen in parallel to the familiar world we know about. I remember being very frightened and horrified even -- I was a timid child! -- but there was also an undeniable attraction to the ""dark side,"" which I found unexpectedly in the familiar characters."
3,Ringo Starr-Christmas Collection,This CD was for my sister-in-law for Christmas last year. Who knows if she listens to it or likes it? Only she knows. But it was on her Amazon 'wish list' and that's why I chose to get it for her.
1,terrible,"I purchased this game used. It seemed cool, as the Nintendo64 version was good. When I started to play it, it was entaertaining... for a while, until the repetitive gameplay started to kick in. The annoying parts were the jumps and unfair opposing damage. I played it for ten minutes and then my game froze. It wasn't my Game Boy Color, it was probably just that it was used. That made me kind of mad, as I had [aid an unreasonable price for the game. I played on, hoping it wouldn't freeze again. I got to level two, the haunted mansion level, but I couldnt complete it! There was absolutly no way to jump up onto the ledge to go further into the level. I immidiatly returned the game with no regrets."
3,A Great Book Simply For The Analysis,"One may differ with the author's conclusion, but one cannot deny the book is a fascinating analysis of the Barbarossa blitzkrieg campaign in Russia.For example, the author superimposes a map of the French campaign upon a map of the Russian campaign area to give a sense of comparative scale.Excellent 'rate-of-advance' maps are also included, showing the progression of the German offensive by the week. By viewing these, one gets a sense of the true German intention as well as areas of strong Russian resistance.An astute reader can draw many conclusions on the mechanics of motorized war and the Barbarossa Campaign.To reject the entire work simply because one disagrees with the author's opinion is folly.It is an insightful work as far as close analysis of the 'blitzkrieg' technique is concerned."
1,How German army could have won the war if its opponents did exactly what it wanted them to do.,"Poorly researched one sided opus, that has very little in common with what actually was happening on the EF. For the detailed analysis see Operation Barbarossa - The Case Against Moscow at Axis History Forum"
1,Stupid and Pointless,"I got this because i was working in the forest service and often found myself without cell phone reception, what a waste of money. save the time and effort and just get a verizon phone they always had more bars than my phone did even with this stupid antenna."
1,So Bad I Don't Know Where To Start,"This book is symptomatic of what is wrong with gay-themed/oriented fiction, that is, just about anything no matter how awful is published. The losers are the readers. Were the target audience for this book, teenage girls; then I would say, yes the author has hit the mark. However, any mature gay man must be insulted by this cliche-ridden piece of fluff. Were it funny, it might be worth it; but even the jokes are tired, shop worn gay laugh lines that we've all heard/read many times before. Always be leary of a writer who can't even weave together a narrative but relies on fake looking, unconvincing memoranda, letters and other cheap writing tricks. Do yourself a favor and avoid this one like the gay plague."
1,Why Feminism is Dead,"Why is feminism dead? Because mentally ill types like Dworkin and her partner in crime Catherine MacKinnon became the face of the movement in the 1980s and 1990s. Hard to believe a bunch of spineless male academics ever let themselves be bullied by psychotic females spouting this kind of hate-ridden tripe. ""Hate speech"" was always OK with the hypocritical Dworkin and MacKinnon as long as it was directed at people *they* supposedly hated (like heterosexual men). Thank God Camille Paglia came along and blew these two away with reason and logic they couldn't refute. Andrea Dworkin = human dung."
1,evil,I did like her Dead floating Women and a second one with a similar title but this novel was not of(for) my taste.
2,Watch your baby closely--Be Careful--,"I don't disagree with the fact that this is a good toy for the hand coordination and general development of a young toddler. My daughter enjoys it. BUT you need to keep in mind that this is a solid hard wood cube shaped toy. My daughter accidently fell and hit her head hard on the corner. (You should have heard the loud noise...)She got a bad bruise on her forehead for at least 15-16 days. After the bruising is gone, the hit mark didn't completely disappear. So...either watch your kid very closely or don't buy this toy until after your child masters walking and/or standing up in balance. If I knew what I know now I would go for another kind of development toy rather than this one."
1,Item never received due to lack of inventory,"After waiting almost 3 weeks, I got a notice stating thatthey were sorry, but they were unable to ship my order dueto none in inventory. Needless to say, I was very upset asthis was a Christmas gift that I could have purchased locally but chose to order through Amazon as a matter of convenience. I will not make the same mistake twice."
3,Not too busy,"At first I thought my little girl would love this toy since every time we go to any doctors office, there are tons of these and she can't just stop playing. But, once I got this home, she hardly touches it. She plays with the MAZE but that's about it. I'm not disappointed. I like the product. Maybe when she's a little older, she'll appreciate it."
5,Great Toy for Toddlers!!!,"My son recieved this from his grandparents (I mean santa!), last christmas, he loved it as soon as he saw the box! (I had to pull hi away from it just to get it out of the box as well). now 18 months, he loves it still! It's smaller that most activity cubes and bead mazes, which is great for those of us who are short on floor space (we live in a small apartment, so this is ideal!) I am impressed by the craftsmanship and the quality of the paint. My son (who can be a bit of a terror to toys) has done everything to this cube (banged his wooden blocks on it, knocked it downn and dragged it across the room, sraped other toys against it) and it still shows no signs of wear!"
2,This food makes her vomit :(,"I have a 5 yr old cat that has a sensitive stomach and when I fed her this food she vomited all over our house! She loves the taste of it just the vomiting afterwards is what I do not like. So, today I bought her a small bag of Iams to try for sensitive cats, though a little more pricey...I feel comforted knowing she is not gonna be throwing up all night. I won't be purchasing meow mix again."
2,Don't loose the reciver,"Don't loose the reciver becuse the software and reciver are conected some how. I lost mine and just bought a new reciver and I found out that the mapping software will not work with any other reciver, even the exact same model. So I am out another $120+ . I even called Garmin telling them that I have had it just a little over 2 months, I even had registed it, have orginal boxes & CD. No the software is keyed with the reciver. If I submitted a police report they ""would see what they could do"". I will probley cough up another $125 for a new set, Very reluctantly. It was a great product and used it alot while it worked."
5,Money skills,Good book to help your children learn how to save and spend money. Written in a way that younger children can appreciate.
5,I won't give up,Don't walk away yet was very inspirational and encouraging to my spirit.God used Rev.Brewer in a powerful way to remind us that he has not forgotten us.Many of times along this journey I have felt like giving up.This book was a source of hope and strength.I won't give up because there is purpose for my delay but I will not be denied.Thanks Rev. Brewer.I won't give up.
5,It`s the Best,This game is awsome. It is the best game i`ve ever played. And the graphics are so real. I give it 5 stars!
4,best game of the year(hopefully),Hey i have the first one its awesome in the first one you can be the green goblin well harry annyway i hope in this one you can be doc ock it would be awesome anyway this game seems cool because YOU CAN GO IN THE STREETS it seems awesome well you probably remember me when i told you about true crime well whatever i said dont listen im selling it it sucks well spiderman two will be the best game ever. see ya
1,This Game Was Created By 5-Year Olds,"There are many flaws with this game. The voice acting is cheesy and nobody moves their mouths. The combat is very hard to use because when you try to execute a combo, someone shoots you and messes you up. The graphics are sub-standard.It is pretty realistic in that you actually have to be under something to use your web. That's pretty much it."
2,not as sturdy as my old Sherpa bag. disappointed...,sure is kinda filmsy compared to my old one about 7 years ago.Thinking about returning it....i had one from another cat and gave it away. Now i need it for travel on the airlines and it is Just not as good...
1,Doesn't comply with Delta's own regulations.,"Delta restricts pet carriers for in-cabin 'carry on' use to the maxmium dimensions of 17""L x 12""W x 8""H. The carrier above is not within specification. Better to know that now than find out later at the ticket counter."
1,"Great in Theory, Trama for me and Pup.","My 8 lb. maltese clawed/chewed through/got out of mesh webbing in 5 mins.-bleeding and all-back floor of car. My pup crying and tramatized, I cannot use this product. Unless animal is sedated or used to crating, forget about it. Believe me, don't waste your money and time. I cannot imagine shoving this product w/ your pet under an airline seat. p.s. I read these kind of reviews about this product before, but hoped it would not happen to me. Returning to PETCO store wonderful customer support but complicated because I purchased on-line."
5,no worries!,"After looking at many ""fashion"" carriers at pet stores, I opted for the 'Delta airlines approved', understated black sherpa bag.It has several vents for air and for your pet to see, has a cushioned mat, and is well constructed.It also works well for traveling in a car. It is small enough to fit on the seat, yet large enough for my dog to stand and move around.Highly reccommend."
3,Somewhat disappointed,"I got this pet carrier and it was brand new; however, there was black rust on one of the metal attachment pieces. Disappointed in paying over 35 dollars for black rust. It does not come off. We will see if AA even allows this bag. The bag looks nice other than that and my cat already takes a liking to it."
1,High- Protein Cookbook,The high protein cook book was too gourmet for me. I have very few of the ingredients in the house and if bought I would only use them for that one dish. I gave the book away.
1,Reader,"If you cook and eat like they do on the Food Network, this book is for you. If you are an average cook & diner (like me) who does not keep exotic items in your pantry or fridge, I'd pass on this cookbook. I sent my copy back to Amazon.com."
4,Crispin the Cross of Lead,"Crispin the Cross of Lead is about a 13 year old boy whos mother dies. He is acussed of stealing something from his masters house and decared a wolf's head. Aclif is looking for Crispin and warning him by hanging people and putting a note on the dead people so Cripin can read it but the only problem is that Crispin can't read. Then Crispin finds ""Bear"" in a destroied city and becomes ""Bears"" servent for the rest of his life. ""Bear"" helps Crispin by being able to read and write so if there is anything warning ""Bear"" can read it and tell Crispin what they say."
4,Highly Recomended,"Crispin and The Cross of Lead is a very good book that is easy to read. The main characters are Crispin and Bear. Crispin is running from gaurds the whole time. They go to Great Wexly to start a new life. Crispin was blamed for killing someone. They are trying to hide from all of the gaurds that are after them and Bear knows someone in Great Wexly that shelters them. I liked the book because it is weird and very interesting in its own way. I like the part when Bear kills one of the gaurds by throwing him into the other soldiers swords. The conflict in the book was when crispin was responsible for killing a lord. He was called ""Bears Head"" for that reason. He also had a cross that he didnt know was written on it, wich was given to him by his mother when he was younger. I would highly recommend this book to anyone because it is easy to understand the middle ages and never gets boring."
2,Crispin,In the book Crispin the main character is a boy whose mother has been killed. He runs away and meets a man named Bear. After that he is declared a wolf's head which means anyone can kill him and it is not a crime. Crispin and Bear have many adventures during their friendship.I didn't think Crispin was a very good book. It jumped around a lot and never fully explained what was happening like when the priest died. The people were very visible and funny. I didn't like how random it was and I didn't like how he was always on the run. I also think the plot could have taken some development. I didn't really like the book.
2,An OK Book,"It was deffinatly not the best book in the world. It wasn`t the worst either (which is Mockinjay). I liked it enough to keep reading, but I didn`t like it much."
2,Don't Read This Book,"This book is probably the worst book I have read this year. Avi wrote this book and I think this is one of his worst book he has ever written. I think Avi is a great author and I am suppressed about this book because it is really bad. The first half of the book is very boring and the second half is not that better. This book is also very boring and to religious. All they talk about is god. This is a book that is about a boy named ""Asta's son"". His mom and his priest died so he runs away on the search for his dad. When he runs away and find a guy called Bear. He goes on a lot of adventures with. This book is mostly about Bear and Asta's Son going on a lot of adventures trying to survive,. This book is really boring so don't read it."
3,Disappointing Newbery,"I enjoyed reading Crispin : The Cross of Lead, but do not feel that it quite reaches Newbery quality. Other of Avi's books, notably Nothing But the Truth and The True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle, are much better reads. In the genre of Medieval Fiction for kids, Karen Cushman's books rate higher. I will recommend Crispin to my students, but not with quite the enthusiasm of the others mentioned above."
3,Crispin,Overall I give Crispin: Cross of Lead a 6 out of 10. It was an up and down adventure.There was not to much action in the book and that's what I like. The writing and vocabulary are very skilled. Three quarters of the book were boring. However the action parts were very exciting and suspensful.If you like AVI you should read this book but if you don't try it out anyway.
1,I was so disappointed.,"My older sister said it was good so I picked it up and read it and I'm so sad i did. It did not even finish the plot and this was so confusing yet predictable. This is one of the worst books I have ever read so if you are looking for an adventure, do not read it because this was a total wast of my valuable time."
4,"I Wouldn't Recommend It, but it's Definitely Good","This book is the first I've read of Avi. It's good, and I liked it, but it's not a must-read, as some people claim. For one thing, it jumps into the plot a wee bit too quickly. But its plot is enriched with clues about the life that Crispin never suspected. If you like suspense, it's definitely a thriller. More often than not, I could not put it down (but partially because I get bored easily, and because most of the chapters are extremely short)."
4,Delightful,"I just finished reading this book and found it delightful! It's been awhile since I read any juvenile fiction, and it was a welcome treat. It made me realize just how wordy, complicated, and adjective laden many adult books ARE.The ending was not what I expected. In fact, it's probably not what *I* would have chosen. But it's a beautiful coming of age story that is both sad and heartwarming."
4,"good period piece, predictable plot","Crispin is a 13-year-old orphan peasant in 14th century England, running from his village, pursued by the manor lord's steward. He becomes the servant, then apprentice, of Bear - a juggler, ex-priest, revolutionary spy who envisions an England where peasants and laborers may regain their ""ancient freedoms"". This is a quick, easy, fairly suspenseful read that brings Crispin's 14th century, Christian, surf mindset to life. You can see all the twists and turns coming, but maybe a 10-year-old couldn't. Unchallenging, but believable. I don't know why this won the Newberry award, unless it was to generally acknowledge Avi for his accomplishments. Still, a decent read, particularly for a student interested in medieval life. ages 10+"
4,A review by Amanda England.,"I like the book Crispin. The reason why I like it is because its visible, and what I mean by that is you can see it going on in your mind as it's being read. Crispin was accused of stealing and murder. So now he in known as a wolf's head meaning anyone can kill him. He met a guy named Bear, when he ran away from Stromford. When he met Bear they traveled from city to city together. The story is about them trying to gain their freedom.If I was to recommend this book to any one I'd recommend it to all the kids in different schools. I think that they might enjoy it if they're into adventurous stories."
2,a kids review,"My reviewWhen my reading teacher started to read the book ''Crispin the Cross of Lead Reviews'' I wasn't very interested in listening. After five minutes of listening, I started to get inquisitive to the book. Predictive it was not. There was great suspense as my teacher enthusiastically read to us. I felt like I was a character in the book. Avi just captured me and brought me into the book as I was listening. I respected the book a lot and I hope that anyone who reads this book will enjoy it as much as I did."
4,Great job AVI!,"This book is great! It has a exciting plot, and the author gives great descriptions of characters and places. The main characters real name is Crispin but in the village he is called Asta's Son. He is accused of stealing and is proclaimed a wolf's head, which means anyone can kill him on sight. A man tells Crispin his real name, and helps him escape. Crispin runs into a man named Bear, and he and Crispin go around to different towns playing music, singing and juggling. I give this book a 7.5 out of 10!"
2,Not an Award Winner,"Our teenage book discussion group thought that Crispin should not have won the Newbery Award. The plot starts out slow and gets slower, and the ending is a disappointment. The historical setting of the book is the only part that is well done."
2,Disappointing,"I read this to my son since it won the Newberry and was disappointed. It started out with a good premise, and did give you a good feel for the time period, but there wasn't enough action. The ending was also a letdown. I finished it, but I wouldn't recommend it."
1,Spoilt my party!,"This item sucked! We diluted the chocolate with oil as recommended by the other reviewers here. It was liquidy enough when we poured it in, but within seconds, the chocolate started to cool and coagulate, even though the heat was turned on. The fountain stopped flowing in less than 2-3 minutes, and we were left with a clumpy chocolate mess to clear up. Not fun."
5,Great little chocolate fountain!,"We purchased this chocolate fountain for our daughter's wedding reception, and it was a hit! When the box arrived, we had family visiting, so we set it up to make sure it worked. Setup was easy, and with only a little tweaking on the chocolate to oil ratio, it worked perfectly. At the wedding, it was the hit of the country fair themed food, and ran for almost four hours without any problem."
1,stainless steel?,"I havent used this yet. I just got in time for a New Years Eve party. It is NOT stainless steel. The bowl and machine housing are steel. The auger, column, and tiers are all plastic. I expect that this appliance will not last long. dont waste your money on this one."
5,Great fountain,Ordered chocolate fountain for a dinner party. Very easy to assemble and instructions on use are clear and easy to follow. Great for parties and was a big success. Can't wait to use again.
3,Choose chocolate carefully,"I have used many chocolate fountains and this one is below average. However, it did run good with proper chocolate (SF Signature purchased here on Amazon - see below link). When it is ran with chocolate chips or other chocolate, you have to add a large amount of vegetable oil which really takes away from the quality of the chocolate and the fountain can bog down. I would say Nostalgia is the bottom of the barrel when it comes to chocolate fountains, but with the SF Signature chocolate I used, it ran OK. If you like cheap throw away equipment, this is the fountain for you.SF Signature Dark Chocolate Fondue, 3.5-Pound (Pack of 2)"
4,Nice chocolate fountain,"This is my first chocolate fountain, and I'm pretty pleased with my purchase. It's easy to assemble and use, not too loud.The only issue is the reservoir where the chocolate pools doesn't come off for cleaning, so that's a pain. I don't know if any other models have this feature either. For the price I think it's a great model and it looks more high end than some of the others I have seen."
3,"The thinner the chocolate, the better!","This fountain has trouble with thicker liquid chocolate. Eventually cloggs and stops running due to the fact that it's not strong enough, so make sure you use a fairly thin type of liquid chocolate."
5,NOTHING LIKE IT!,"One day last year I was walking back from the beach, and I heard the sound of Celtic war drums: the Wicked Tinkers were playing to a huge crowd from pubescent street punks to surfers to yuppies, and everyone was having the time of their life. These guys are the greatest!"
1,Barbie still a let down,"I would certainly label myself anti-Barbie, and this incarnation of the traditional ""blonde bombshell"" did little to eliminate my sentiments. Although Mattel made an effort, they still fail to see the ultimate problem with their over-marketed girl. Simply, that looks and measurements equal power and rank. In other words, only women who fit this description will be accepted in society in a position of power because they maintain the stereotype that the patriarchy holds all women to. Mattel needs to either retire this worn out misogynistic toy or truly update her, figure and all!"
2,a few good things,"There are a few good points made in here. But I'm appalled at how many pages he gives to the basic idea of mentally joining opposites, so one sees the world more holistically. A decent point. But he says, ""You should not see things as feminine or masculine,"" and expands on that. And he lists all these opposites, one by one, page after page, that you should see as one. He could basically have said in two pages ""See the world as yin and yang"" like the Taoist symbol, and not belabored it so extensively. The rest of the book has good points. But it is basically watered-down Abraham Maslow, from his book, TOWARD A PSYCHOLOGY OF BEING. Maslow says it better in that book."
5,THE best sci-fi novels I have ever read!,"'Barlowe's Guide To Extraterrestrials' is what turned me onto to these books, and what a discovery they were, too! Vance's four 'Tschai: Planet Of Adventure' novels are top-notch reading entertainment. His penchant for lush description in few words is refreshing, and the story of a human stranded on an alien planet and his subsequent attempts to get back to Earth is as engaging as any. These stories deserve a cinematic treatment! Bravo to Mr. Vance. Do not miss reading this series, I implore you!"
3,"Good, not great","These books move quickly and have flourishes of action, but I think Vance lacks character development. Granted this is pulp sci fi from a master, but it could have done so much more. Characters from different civilizations who could have had very interesting perspectives are used as accessories to an extended travelouge across this planet.The endless journeying over wastelands serve as excuses for Vance to deploy cool words describing scenery. He and his protege Gene Wolfe match Thomas Hardy in their descriptive power relating to scenery."
5,Great playard,"This playard has all the features you want in a playard - it includes comfortable padding (much better than graco), a nice bassinet with removable toy arches and a convenient, flip-away changing table. It's also much nicer looking than others on the market. It's worth every penny!Someone complained about the setup and take-down, but I don't understand why. It's so simple and quick, I wouldn't change a thing."
2,Poor Functionality,"It is very difficult to put the crib up and pack it away. It is not very convient for travel. Once it is up and put together, it works fine. The night light, vibrator, and music programs are a nice touch. Also, the crib pad, bassinet, and changer are very nice. However, I would recommend a less expensive Graco model. They are much easier to put up and fold down."
4,Ken Griffey Is an Excellent game,"Ken Griffey Jr MLb is an excellant game. It is the best game out there for the gameboy. some of it's special features include trade a player, Home run derby, and season mode. When i first played it, it was hard but i turned on auto fielding and now it rules. This is a must buy if you only have original gameboy like me."
1,A babie game,This game is the best game ever created. Of course only for children 1-3. if any one older than 3 got this game I would be forced to laugh in there face
2,A great book to introduce pre-schoolers to the body.,"This book is a good introduction to the human body for very young children. I attempted to interest my children in the book (6 and 9 years old), but ready answers to the books questions came from their own personal knowledge not the book. They were not interested in the ""Let's find out!"" portion and came up with their own experiments to investigate the questions.I suppose that a child with little natural curiosity would find this book interesting. But if you are trying to introduce new concepts to your children there are better bets."
2,Fast&Easy missed content and correct explanation,"Far from an average book, the author just compiled some essencial stuff and commented (poorly) some code, repeating over and over again the same lines like ""this creates an object of..."" and skip other lines much more important for statements where type cast (e.g.) is present. Also, the ""on-line shop"" she advertise as ""Develop an Oline Store!"" is nothing more than MS's ""GrocerToGo"" sample and even on this sample, her comments to some code lines aren't enought to explain the inner works of that shopping cart classes, she skip again some crucial lines, maybe because she can't understand what they mean. That shopping cart code comments also end in rush (maybe she just wanted to finish the book quick). My two stars goes to the effort in collecting the content."
1,not a book at all,"I bought this book thinking it was an actual story book, but it's really just a book of quotes, that I guess should inspire, but a child couldn't understand their meaning at all."
3,Decent Feldman Double Feature,"Rock 'N' Roll High School Forever is definitely the better film included here. And it just proves that a ton of bare breasts can't compare to Mary Woronov playing an evil principal. You see, South Beach Academy has a ton of nudity. So much so in fact, that it becomes boring. However, Rock 'N' Roll High School is funny, cool, and silly fun!"
3,Not much of a challenge,"Test Drive Cycles is one of the easiest racing games I have ever played. In no time at all you can own the best available bike and have it spruced up with all the upgrades you can get. There aren't many bikes to choose from or very many courses to race. In no time you'll have each course memorized and know how to race it- for example when racing in the USA always stay on the right side of the road because we all know that oncoming traffic is on the left. Overall not the most exciting game, not the worse. If you want to race motorcycles, get Road Rash."
2,Doesn't do much..,"It lights up, but it doesn't do a whole lot more. My four year old grandson could take it or leave it; he hasn't been seen playing with it since he got it for Christmas. Not worth the money."
1,Treats too Big for Small Dogs.,Actual treats are 3 times larger than the picture on the box. My King Charles Spaniel cannot even chew them they are so big. They are roughly the size of a double stuff oreo and hard as a rock.
2,My Dog Has Trouble Eating These!,"I bought this dog food for my dog, Paris Lucille, and she absolutely adores them! But she's a shelty, and she's small, sothese are a little big for her. I wish that they would make asmaller version so my dog could eat these and ask for more so Icould teach her to do tricks better. Do not buy these for smalldogs!"
2,USB Charger/Sync cable,"This was a great concept that has been let down by shoddy workmanship. The Cable works just fine, but does not plug into the Palm properly despite having a locking unit. Many times the contacts do not transmit data and the plug has to be moved back and forth to get it working. I am very disappointed!"
4,A good read,"I enjoyed this book. I was researching the Quakers in regard to socially responsible investing (SRI), their ancient stance against slavery often being quoted as an illustration. The author does a good job of tracing the Quaker movement from its origins through its evolutional period and ends just before the modern era. It was entertaining, though I only gleaned a bit about their investing habits. Essentially, they were excellent businessmen, hard workers, and charitable to the greatest extent. They put their money where their morals were, very impressive compared to today's businessmen. However, though they are highly praised by SRI, I doubt they would return the praise to today's SRI movement. The Quakers were more akin to today's Biblically Responsible Investing (BRI) movement, an offshoot from SRI. Today's slavery issue is abortion, which SRI ignores completely.A good read for anyone interested in English / American history or responsible investing."
2,"As I've said before, this has been done better!","This CD cannot compare to a CD entitled ""Lost And Found"" which is the definitive collection of The Beach Boys' pre-Capitol recordings. Said CD contains many bonus tracks like demos, studio chatter, alternate takes and mixes, etc - not just the final released versions found here.If you can find that CD, which has mysteriously seemed to disappear since this and the ""Surfin'"" CD released in 2000 - both RIP-OFFS! - came out, then do not hesitate to get it. If not, you'll have to settle with this for now. Sorry."
5,back cover reads,"Here's an attractive and practicle collection of copyright-free ornanamental frames and borders that captures the beauty and intricacy of Celtic art. All borders appear on nonreproducible blue background grids that make layout quick and easy. Nine spectacular animals and mythical creatures: eagle, peacock, cormorant, heron, lion, dog, merman, mermaid and dragon and alphabet."
5,Berenstain Bears are great books for new readers!,"My daughter loves the Berenstain Bears. The books help her to improve her reading and comprehension skills, and the topics are easy for a preschooler / elementary school child to grasp. They teach children about values, and this book focuses on exaggerating the truth and making excuses to get out of doing something that is not well liked. I hear these type of comments from time to time from my little one. When you can relate Sister Bear's behavior to your own child's and ask them questions about times when they may have done something like this, it reinforces good behavior in a positive manner."
3,"OK Product, but network only connection is slow","This external drive has some decent features. The underlying FS is XFS powered by an embedded Linux OS on ARM. Supports CIFS, FTP, HTTP, and Bonjour protocols. And external USB drive connection is possible for future expansion.The key issue is that it is very slow for transfers. I saw only 200kB/s when trying to backup a standard drive image with many small files. Large file transfers went faster at 2-5 MB/s; however, there is apparently a large delay for small file creation."
5,Works!,Helps my constipated son with his bowel movements. Gentle and safe and effective. One can give as needed or take regularly.
4,I love this doll.,"She is my favorite Chelsea so far.I got her when they first released her.And I have collected and played with her ever since.She is a very pretty doll,so get her while she is still in stock."
5,In love with this wallet/coin/cosmetic pouch :),"I ordered the pink color and absolutely love it. This shade of pink is vintage looking...sort of salmon in tone and the eel skin is very soft, supple, and has a bit of sheen to it. The inner snap is great for loose change. This pouch/wallet is just big enough to be extremely versatile and great for tossing things in when in a hurry at the store (my iPhone 4, coupons, loose checks, discount cards, etc.) and small enough and cute enough to carry on quick errands when I don't want to lug my big purse around. It's worth every penny and I like the secure snaps so I don't have worry about it accidentally opening in my purse. I'm going to order it in other colors and replace my current cosmetic pouch with one of these. For me, it's worth the $20 - quality, versatility, and fashionable to boot."
5,"So, So Lovely!","I was looking for a black change purse, it has been achieved with this one! It is so, so pretty!, a must see in person. The description is totally accurate! To me, it has a ""vintage look"" which I like very much! The uses are endless. Shipped before estimated date, excellent packaging! Highly recommend!"
1,Hard to keep together,"My 5 year old son picked this toy out at Costco for around $20. I thought it looked like a lot of fun. We had a lot of fun putting it together but it did take a long time. Once we were done and tried it out pieces kept falling off. I had to rig it so that it would stay together. Needless to say it was very frustrating for my son. Both my boys played with it for a little while then became bored just watching the marbles do the same thing over and over again. I would say 95% of the fun was in building it. It's a neat idea but it needs to come with instructions on how to build other marble runs to keep it interesting. Kids have fun when they're the ones playing with the toys not when they're the ones being played (i.e. watching the toy). I'm going to try the Back To Basics wooden marble run. It looks more ""idea"" friendly."
1,RASH,"Aspercreme was the ONLY one with 100% NO smell.However .......After 2 days of use on my back it caused such a rash on my body - thought I was going to die.I have no known allergies, but there's something in this that's bad news...These others have their own drawbacks...but seem to work better.Myoflex Odorless Pain Relief Cream - 4 Oz<<<<< This one did have a smell, not a bad or big smell, but it did have a smell of something medicinal - very slight smell...Bengay Ultra Strength Cream, 4-Ounce Tube<<<<<< of course this one is he big LOSER that STINKS to high heaven along with:Tylenol Precise Pain Relieving Cream 2.5-Ounce (Pack of 2)<<<<< this one that stinks up the room even more than Bengay (smells like pepsodent toothpaste!)Buy."
2,Great content - atrocious printing,"The content of this book is phenomenal. However, the proof reading and printing is atrocious. The are numerous mis-prints throughout the book. For example:Ch. 3 - p. 49; Fig 3.4 shows negative numbers surrounded by U rather than () or a -Quotes and italics are replaces with British pound signsIn Ch. 4 - starting on page 81 the page footer reads: ""Chapter 3""The printing is even in different shades of grey.This is horrible. I spent my hard earned money on a book (when I preferred a Kindle edition.) I expected something better than a middle school student would produce.Overall I'm highly disappointed in the quality of the publishing of this book."
1,staged performance,"Don't waste your money on this performance. It is a staged early rock video like they used to have on shows like Hullabaloo. I paid a $1.50 at a thrift store & that was too much. Really lousy performance, not even close to being real."
5,A Message for Our Generation,"This is one of the best books written by Max Lucado. It is certainly the message for our ""Me"" generation.I have read it many times and get something new for my life every time.Keep writing, Max."
2,Hard to hold interest,"I never really got into this book. May have been me? I found it to be simplistic and slow, never really held my interest. I did finally finish the book, but to be honest, I didn't retain anything of a positive nature."
4,just as I remember,I remember this when I was a kid. very funny. used to get drunk and watch when I was in High school
5,great,This octenol refill is such a help to us. We cannot buy it in the store and are so greatful that we can get it so easily through Amazon. This is a wonderful product to help keep mosquitos under control.
4,Buy the bigger one,"There's nothing wrong with this gel wrap, but I have the larger one and would recommend it. The larger wrap covers more area and has more flexibility and is worth the extra money."
3,it works better in Winter,Not too bad of a product. It works better in the winter and stays longer. The only disadvantage is that you have to wait 2 hours for it to get cold enough to use
5,Great,Best cold / hot pad I have ever owned every one should have one works very well and effectivelyWould buy again
5,elasto-gel is cool,"This product was all that they said it was, a very quality product indeed. Maintains it's cold for the length of service needed and it only takes a couple of hours to re-chill it."
5,6x16 Elasto-gel,"I've had my Elasto-gel for three years and have used it on hand/wrists, knees, and feet. It has held up very well and gives a much better penetrating cold than ice with no hard edges or leaking. This is a handy size for many body parts.Elasto-Gel 6"" x 16"" All Purpose Therapy Wrap - Elasto Gel #TW6002"
4,If you like challing games this is for you,"This game is one of the most difficult games I have. One of the reasons is for example, on the first level if you go right after you get the key you'll have to start from the very begining agin. For unlimeted lives type in elphant."
1,Will not re-charge my IPAQ 3835,"I bought this cable to avoid having to purchase an AC charger and a USB sync cable for my Compaq IPAQ 3835. But it will not charge the IPAQ through the USB connection as advertised. However, it will sync with my PC via this cable."
2,Not That Great...buy something else.,The game is really easy. The bad guys can shoot worth crap and the same goes for your teammates. Your teammates and hostages get stuck alot during the game. I found the planning stage to be hard to control and hard to get the way points where they should be. Plus there are weapons in the game that you could never use...like breaching charges and lockpicks...since there are no doors that where locked...and they automatically open when you walk into them. I'm a big fan of the origional PC game but this was a dissapointment for me.
4,comfort,"As other reviewers at first I found this roll to uncomfortable. I wanted to keep it clean, so I used the enclosed cover. The roll itself is very soft and pliable, but the woven cover made less flexible ergo very uncomfortable, couldn't stand it for more than a couple of hours. However I tried it without the cover and have been able to use 2 full nights, and see no reason why I can't continue to do so. Note to manufacturer: make a softer stretchy removable cover and you have a winner."
3,I was disappointed with such a small digital camera bag...,My biggest complaint is that my camera hardly fit into the bag. The adapter works great and the memory card is a good extra to have. For the price I don't think I got my money's worth.
1,Very Disappointed Too,"I liked the concept of this video, but I was very disappointed with the content and the quality. The video is essentially 30 minutes of simple leg lifts and squats, some of which can be done with your baby (this is good), but some of which is done while you lay your baby on the ground. The intensity of the workout was very low - it would probably only be very useful for people who rarely work out. In addition, the video looks like it was filmed in someone's house by one of their friends. Throughout the video there are closeups on the babies, but not on the women doing the moves. Even though it was a simple video it was actually hard to follow at times. I'd return it if I could."
3,"Good song, but Vasquez fans shouldn't expect a dance track","I'm not making any criticism of this song, but just warning club kids and fans of DJ Junior Vasquez that his mix is NOT a housetrack, but just a downtempo remix of the original, and it's only 4:36 long."
3,Great idea,"I like the idea of this bag - but it is too small for my yoga mat. I think this bag is designed to fit only Gaiam yoga mats, so beware if your mat has more padding than a typical mat. Color in person is lighter than in the picture, more of a light khaki."
5,Wonderful,"It had been a really long time since I watched any slayer's stuff. Watching this was great. The animation is very good and story plot is interesting. It brings in all your favorite old characters. They all act the same as they used to too. I watched Slayer's Excellent right after I watched this again and I have to say this was way better. However, I do believe the voice actor for Lina is different in the English version, but I'm not completely sure. Her voice seems way more alive in this forth season. If you like the Slayer's seasons or even if you don't this is a great anime to watch."
5,Lina is back and better than ever!,"It's been over a decade since Slayers ended and now its back with a new season! Things start up with a slam-bang entrance from Lina and Gourry harassing a group of pirates due to a significantly lowered bandit population. However during this attack, the Dynamic Duo re-encounter Amelia and Zelgadis, along with a government agent named Wizer who want to arrest Lina simply for being Lina! Also introduced is a strange creature with amazing power named Pakota who looks like a Pokemon created by Hot Topic. ANYWAY, Ignore all the nay-sayers who don't like this as much as the original 3 seasons. The writing is still great, the animation's better than ever, and the characters are intact with all their original voice actors in both languages (Minus Xellos for English)! No Slayers fan should pass this up, and if you aren't interested in the story then there's one reason that should be enough for any fan: Lina Inverse."
4,Yin Yoga,"I took a weekend workshop with Sarah Powers a few years ago in Washington, DC and love the Yin practice. I love this DVD and love to listen to Sarah's words of wisdom. She is a fabulous teacher and has a thorough knowledge of Buddhism. If you are interested in yin yoga, you should buy this DVD because it is wonderful. Her yang practice is great as well."
4,"About time, this dvd Daphne release!","This is definitely not the ultimate Daphne. June Andersson is a consumate pro, but she can't make me forget Renée Fleming in this role. The rest of the cast is very much OK, as is the orchestra. The same goes for Paul Currans production: not world shocking, but it certainly has its merits. What seduced me most was the stunning HD quality of this release. Bearing in mind that this is the only available dvd of this interesting Strauss opera, I rate it with a four star review."
2,mediocre performance,"The electric and magical air of the Bohm recording is missing from this, mainly because the conductor doesn't come close to matching Bohm, but also because the soloists also don't come close to matching his."
1,Worst Keyboard ever,"I bought on of these things because I needed a keyboard for data entry on my IPAQ and didn't have much cash. I found that it's folded form was really small, but... It's actual use as a keyboard was horrid. The typing felt all wrong and most of the thing didn't seem to be able to keep up with my typing. Sure, the pause from pressing a key and it showing up on the ipaq was small, but when your typing long lines of data it's unacceptable. In short.. I returned it and coughed up the cash for the Stowaway."
1,ZERO connectivity!,"This product is very selfish! I bought it expecting an extra port or something that would allow me to hook it up to my computer or a modem or something and type while it's connected. Nope. This is the ONLY device you can use with your iPaq. No e-mail on-the-go, no mobile IM'ing, nothing. Only good for typing--and it's not very good at that either."
5,"Wow,nice yoga or sweat pants","These are awesome. Great fit, nice fabric, organic and cool style. These are the best looking and fitting yoga pants I've tried on. I'm 5'11"" about 170 lbs., 34 waist and 32"" inseam and the large fit me perfect."
1,Boring...Same thing over and over...No rhythm,"I wouldn't label this as music as it has no rhythm, purpose or anything to entice the imagination. Not sure how I'd label it. The wind setting off chimes outside has more creativeness than this. It sounds like someone hitting a gong and when it stops making noise, they hit another one until that also stops, and so on. It's monotonous and you keep waiting for something interesting to start and it never does. I suppose if I wanted background sound that wouldn't interrupt thinking this might do the trick, but I didn't find it the least bit entertaining or relaxing, just redundant."
4,War 1974,Book arrived in the condition advertised. I'd read the book as a child and was delighted to find a used copy available in 2011
4,Don't pick it up if you plan to put it down!,"A tale of murder, friendship, and protective family ties, this straight-forward, no words wasted, novel set in Purdy, Mississippi leaves the reader wondering just ""who done it"" and why! A border-line racist theme does not dimish the story of plodding lawyer, Vernon King, more loyal than astute, who goes way out on a limb for his friend, charged with the murder of an infant and the burning of a black church. An easy and enjoyable one-sitting read - especially considering that this is the first novel Jack Kean has written - you won't put it down until you turn the last page!"
4,"Memories, memories.","I remember the first time I played Shadowgate for the NES. Its simple Myst-7th Guest type point and click interface and difficult puzzles made the game addicting. Now it's perfectly reincarnated on Game Boy Color. However, there is only so much excitement involved in this format, and the graphics were simple, even back in the NES days. If you got a Game Boy and a few bucks to spare, pick it up."
3,Don't believe the hype,The series is not nearly as good as everyone says. It's watchable but thats about it.
4,Good entertainment,"Love this show, I didnt get to watch it when it was on tv but bought it cause sounded good and love it, i find it hard to take a break from watching. The story line is good not the same as comic book completely but still good."
5,witchblade,"Just began to watch the whole series from the beginning. This was a great buy for the 7 disc set If you have missed this show entirely you might want to catch it now, an interesting blend of ""hard bitten police procedural"" with fantasy/occult overtones. I'm enjoying it.Peter G."
2,Not what I remember,"I was excited to finally get Witchblade on DVD. I loved the show when it was on TV 8 years ago then something happened...8 years. I can't comment on the music being taken out as I don't remember every song that was in each episode but that didn't take anything away from the show. The writing took it away...I liked the build up to episode eleven then wow! Talk about ""Jumping the Shark"" to the extreme. Completely wrecked the show and I can now see with clear eyes why it was given the pink slip. That was right up there with the famous Dallas dream it all didn't happen episode. Still hard to believe I liked this show as much as I did. It's possible my tastes have changed or TV sci-fi shows have gotten better since this was on. Either way its not what I remember."
4,A new favorite,"I had never heard of this series, but bought it on the basis of the recommendations and the low price. My husband and I are enjoying watching several episodes a week."
2,I FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO WATCH,I was a fan of the comic book but could not stomach the television show. The writing was morelike a daytime soap opera than a cop drama. I found the lead actresses vocals to be grating and her eyebrows looked like two wooly caterpillars fighting. Both were very distracting. The lead villian was less than sinister and cartoon like. The only standout character was Ian Nottingham. There were far to many music video montages where she would ride her motocycle or they played medieval stock footage. Overall could not keep my attention.
4,great movie!!,this is probably my favorite of the beack party movies. i love it ! is a sweet story and has neat music too! trust me and buy/rent it soon!
4,Jim Stafford,"If you remember some of his classics, they are here. It's like going down memory trail."
2,"Adequate , but overpriced and low quality","The Adorama iTTL flash cord works fine, but I was very disappointed in its quality of materials and workmanship...very cheap. Probably won't hold up. The spring-loaded lever that locks the hot shoe to the camera is especially cheapish and looks like it will easily break off. It protrudes dangerously, asking to be bent or broken. If you are expecting a Nikon-quality aftermarket accessory for your Nikon camera, this is not it."
5,Friends and Family,"Well-scripted, well-acted, well-produced movie with a comic twist. A unique film that features gay characters."
5,The Best,"The best Gameboy game that I have ever played is Star Wars Episode I Racer. It is extremely addictive, and quite fun. The little rumble pack included is quite cool. This game takes a while to beat, and it is entertaining to beat Sebulba at the end. The variety of its graphics make this game worth its price."
3,"I'll pass, thanks","Star Wars Episode One Racer is a highly addictive game, but addictive is not necessarily a good thing. The graphics are good, for GBC, bu this game is just like most other GBC racers, this only offers get-in-1st-and-win gameplay, which I personally am not a big fan of. But for others who do enjoy the repeatative and, well, boring pace that this game offers, get this game, but for those who like fun, look elsewhere."
3,Soul Sounds,"This book started out well, as it was written in story form. Then it turned into a day by day account of information that was good information, but became boring to try to read. Story form seems to be more acceptable to my mind to keep it interested and wanting to keep reading the book until it is finished. This book was difficult to keep picking up once the story form ended. This authors other books were excellent. And her life story worth reading about. But a day to day rendition of it made it difficult to keep a true interest in."
4,Great collection of excellent mixes,"Purchased to use for an exercise class I teach (THE BRAINS AND BRAWN WORKOUT), and I've ended up using it for my own workouts as well. I wish each song were actually mixed into the next, but the tempos are consistent for the most part and all are great versions of good, popular hits."
3,"Works, but package has deceptive info","I got this adapter thinking I could use the serial cable for my HP Jornada 568 and get USB speeds for syncing to a new desktop (Windows) and not have to buy a new cable. The product does work, but not at USB speeds. Its driver fools the system into thinking the USB port is another serial port so you configure the sync software (MS ActiveSync in my case) to use the converted serial port. As a result, the syncing worked, but only at a max of 115200 bps instead of the ""500 kbps data transfer rate"" advertised on the package. Maybe other PDAs will work properly, but the Jornada apparently doesn't allow a USB connection if you use the serial cable. For those who need Windows XP drivers or further instructions for Mac, go to http://www.pccrisis.com/prdsupic.htm and scroll to the bottom of the page looking for ""PDA Products"".Bottom line: If you have a Jornada (or perhaps any other PocketPC PDA) and want USB syncing, just get the USB cable."
1,FALSE CLAIMS ON PACKAGE,"This product DOES NOT work as advertised. The packaging claims that it is compatible with OSX 10.1 or above, and this is simply not true. After much web searching, I found an unsupported driver from a company in Taiwan that purported to make this adapter work with 10.2.x, but it did not.This device is a terrible waste of your time and money. Avoid it."
5,Just as I remembered.....,"When my kids were young, the adults and kids would play Pokeno and all of us enjoyed the time together....it looks just like the game I remember playing 37 years ago....what a joy to find it again!!"
5,"Fun for the ""Over 30"" Kids","In my house, we grew up playing PO-KE-NO. If you're looking for a unique gift to give someone, give them a PO-KE-NO game...and a roll of nickels or dimes to fund the winning pots. Happy Holidays!!"
3,Had promise but...,"The start of this book was very good. Emotional and satisfying - then someone's agenda and control got in the way. Most of the book is spent with the main characters separated...and I hate that. The female lead always seems to get the short end of the stick (father is abusive, men take advantage of her, etc.) while the male lead is too prideful for his own good. It ends well, as all romances do, but getting there is drawn out too long."
2,Yuck,"I don't like the taste of these mints at all!!! In fact, after I eat them there's always a long lasting after taste. I've had the peppermint ones, which are much, much better."
3,It'll Do,"This book has a thorough listing of piano chords presented in a manner that makes it easy enough to reproduce them on your own keyboard.The problem is the physical layout of the book: all the C# chords are on one page, for example; the F# on another, the A on another, the Bm on another, etc etc etc.For a beginner to use the book to help them learn a simple song, they have to either flip pages mid-tune, make photocopies to lay side by side, or memorize the different chords before playing. That's fine in the long term, but I know my kids would have more fun learning if they could get to the piano before the studying gets too dull.Still, a good tool."
4,Very good!,"In English: I've only heard the ""Human Beings"" Music, on MTV's VideoClip. It's FANTASTIC!In my language (Portuguese): Eu só ouvi a música ""Human Beings"" uma vez, num VideoClip na MTV. É FANTASTICA!"
1,Image does not represent product,"The image is for Hohner Inc - HOHMTS15 - Multi-instrument Classroom Set, but the product name and price is more consistent the metal clips like theseMAGNETIC SPRING CLIPS 1 1/4 BOX-24"
3,Not a bad finish,"A decent cap on Baudino's multi-narrative/perspective trilogy. For me, the most interesting part was Sari's crisis of faith and her resolution. Is there a Divine Being? Does it really matter in Whom (or What) you believe, as long as the belief is there?Read and find out..."
3,missing heatsink (part# 410421-001),well if the price is too got to be true than it is better you contact the seller before making the purchase. it was my understanding that the heatsink (part# 410421-001 ) comes witht the package.
2,does not work with small vacuum,"It shows that this item goes with the small vacuum by Black and Decker, but it does not attach properly, so it is a waste to purchase this with the small vacuum cleaner that they suggest."
4,Attachments,These are OK......but I'd not purchase again as they are not well matched for the vacum as they were suggested for.
2,Pretty useless,Briefly:Truly micro...so small it clogged with much of anything.Vinyl hose would kink.Adjustable vent holes would not adjust to close much...so vacuum was weak.It's being returned.
1,Doesn't fit all vacuums as advertised!,"I tried this kit on my Eureka Maxima vac and the adapter ""A"" would not even fit. I even tried to use adapter ""B"" and that didn't work either. The tube and other attachments connected and attach like they should but couldn't tell if they work that well or not. Will try it on my girlfriend's vac and hopefully it will work. I'm not going to bother even trying to return it because I only paid less than $2 for it anyways, not even worth the hassle. So don't believe that it fits all vacuums because it don't!"
1,dont waste your money!!,"I cant see how this product received soo many ++++++ ?? the attachments are useless and seem to have been made to use on ones computer keyboard maybe? because the attachments are so minuscule. I would suggest you get some DUCT Tape and some 1/2 "" clear plastic hose and tape the hose to your vacuum inlet after you have inserted aprox. 6"" of it into your vacuum inlet hose. It works great for the job at hand, which is sucking out the lint in the lint trap; (after the filter has been removed of course). Good Luck! don"
3,Meh,"I bought this to help me clean a grand piano. It's probably not the BEST tool for that and I have only used it twice. I can see how it might be useful for other crevice cleaning...The tube is kind of flimsy and bends easily, breaking off suction."
1,May not be as it appeard,"This is a micro attachment, (Tiny) not a full sized one. read the description and do not be fooled by the picture, the hose is 1/2 inch inside diameter. I would return it if but it would probably cost more than it is worth."
4,Decent attachment set,Parts came in promptly and worked with my Dyson vacuum. Would have like there to be some sort of carrying case to hold all the attachments.
3,Micro Vacuum Attachment,The product is okay but didn't meet my expectations.Their should have been another attachment included to fit the canister vacuum which is why I said product so so.
4,Timothy Italian Blend is excellent,Very good coffee. Not too strong. These K-cups are an excellent way to make one cup of coffee.
4,Graphic SF Reader,"Groo has relatives? The mind boggles in sheer, complete and utter disbelief. No matter who you are, this fact is sure to be horrifying. Even worse, there are multiple generations still alive. Someone gets the bright idea to try and make more generations of Groo types, and organises a marriage.Scary."
4,"Creedence meets Buck Owens,Elmore James and the Band.","This is a great album. The production quality is excellent. They are/were a hot bar band. The second track Blue Chevrolet with its Elmore James lick is a classic. The third track Gunsale at the Church evokes lyrics that could have been written by John Fogerty. The final track their anthem HAPPY BOY is a Sing along that is beyond description. The song is pure country. The standard country beat, but it rocks. These guys are awesome musicians well schooled in country, rock and blues. The essential elements for a great bar band. This music will not attract many youngsters into Hip Hop, Rap and the like . Thank God. Put on your Levis, get a pair of cowboy boots and a cowboy hat, grab a cold long neck and enjoy."
3,Not exactly the best?,"Although this CD has a few good highlights (Buddy Blue on a wonderful cover of Neil Young's Powderfinger, and some awesome slide guitar work on Blue Cheverolet) it seems to be bogged down with some ""filler tunes"" that most Beat Farmer fans can live without. Why leave out such classic tunes like Lost Weekend, or Texas? It seems this disc was hastily put out by their record company (supposedly without their permission). If you want to experience the true grit of the band, check out ""Loud, Plowed, and Live"". This is a far better ""greatest hits"" compilation, and a must have to truly appreciate the band."
2,Best of?,Not even close to being a best of album. Whoever chose these tracks could have done a much better job.
5,The Rock n' Roll Machine Rolls On...,"Wow! Hard to believe this concert was recorded in 1983. I wish many contemporary concert film makers would take heed. The video and sound quality is exceptional. The concert is filmed in a manner that allows you to enjoy the performance, without upstaging camera antics. And what a performance it is. Filmed in broad daylight, before a festival crowd, there are no light shows to detract. It's just the band, the fans and the music. And that's all it needs to be.I always enjoyed this band, but was never a huge fan. I bought the DVD partially on impulse and based on the positive reviews on Amazon. All I can say is the Amazon reviews have never led me astray. The DVD, concert and band kick ass. Whether you're a Triumph fan or just a fan of good live rock n' roll, do yourself a favor and check it out. This one earns every single star in the five star rating for a filmed concert."
3,simple,A simple book that can help students who are starting to study neuroanatomy. Don't expect it to substitute a textbook and atlas of neuroanatomy.
4,neuroanatomy made ridiculously simple,Needs more images but otherwise a good review book for neuroanatomy.
4,Oddly beautiful,"A collection of Manson's tunes sung by Steve ""Clem/Scramblehead"" Grogan on lead vocals and acoustic guitar, with background vocals by Red (Sqeaky Fromme), Blue (Sandy Good), Gypsy, Ouisch and Gold (Nancy Pitman/Brenda). Some of the lyrics are kinda creepy, but the Manson girls actually have pleasant singing voices, and Clem weren't no slouch on the gee-tar, neither! Soothing folk music performed singalong-round-the-campfire style, with apocalyptic lyrics. Kind of a curio for Mansonphiles, but the tunes and the performances aren't half-bad."
1,Whining whining boo hoo,"A very stupid book. The author should stop being such a wimp and start being a real man. Then he'd get a girlfriend. Girls don't like weaklings like this guy. Give me a break, chasing skirts is easy. Straighten out, Mr. Bigge, and stop whining like some pipe smoker."
5,Classic Horror movie now on DVD,"I just saw a listing of upcoming horror releases on dvd and The Abominable Dr.Phibes/Dr.Phibes rises again,was listed as an upcoming release.a great buy alone but together on the same dvd its a super buy."
3,ehhh- its ok.,"This game was ok, it was unique in the gameplay because the levels are 3D. The color is pretty bad with only one color scheme for each 3D level. The short mini games after each level have nice color, but are really easy and quick. It was a neat idea, but after you beat it you never want to play it again. It definitely would've been a hit back with the century-old Game Boy. With all the cool graphics and animation you can get with other games, I wouldn't spend your money on this."
5,Don't be fooled!,"Do not let the name of this game fool you. It is actually suprisingly challenging. I must say that this game is not exactly for five year olds, like they said, because it's too hard! It is very fun and interesting, with many different levels and rounds. This may not be your thing. Remember that each review is stating one person's opinion. Their opinion might not be yours. Just take my word for it. If you like the classic, fun, happy, old, gameboy game, you've got yourself a purchase. I have never liked cartoons, and for the strangest reason, I found this too good to be true! Who would have thought? There are about five rounds in one level. Once the game's over, it starts at the beginning of the level: not the round. When you enter the second level, and the game's over, it brings you to the beginning of the second level: not the first. What a relief! I guarantee you that this game will keep you on the edge of your seat... always!"
5,just what i was looking for,"I was looking for a good intro to dim mak to supplement my martial arts training;this book not only fills that,but it gives user-freindly whys and what-fors behind strikes that a beginner can grasp,but can also be used further along.Much-appreciate"
5,Astonishing and riveting!,"Couldn't put this book down. The adventure-tale aspect alone would have been reason enough to read it, but the description of the nomadic Arabs who enslaved Captain Riley and his crew is not only fascinating but educational. While the story is at times heartbreaking and difficult to read, there are heroes and acts of kindness on both sides and ultimately the story is uplifting. Apparently the account of human bondage on which this book was based was very influential on the young Abraham Lincoln."
4,amazing tale of survival,"This story of survival of members of a shipwrecked crew in the mid-1800s is truly astounding, sold into slavery they are forced to survive in the incredibly harsh environment of the western Sahara. An interesting account of the daily lives of the people who scratch a living out of this barren landscape"
2,"Barbarism, cruelty and sand, lots of sand.","This is an extraordinarily depressing, horrific account of severe hardship suffered by a few American seamen shipwrecked on the Western African coast in 1815, and subsequently enslaved by an Arab tribe. It's apparently a true account, pieced together from diaries and simple recollections of the crew, held as slaves over several months during a sojourn through the desert amounting to a few hundred miles. Although at times revolting, the book provides a very detailed account of the living conditions and customs of these simple Arab tribes who literally scratch out an existence in the harsh, unforgiving climate of the Western Sahara."
2,Recommendation: read Riley's own account,"King has taken two first-hand accounts of this 1815 ship wreck story -- Robbin's journal (1817)and Riley's well-known Sufferings in Africa (1817)--and combined them into his own day-by-day account of this survival adventure. And, although his book is nicely written, it adds little to the record. Riley's book was in its time read by over a million readers. It was a favorite of Abe Lincoln. It appeared in numerous editions from 1817 through the Civil War years. It was, and, is called ""one of the best adventure books ever written,"" and is now available in a paperback edition of 316 pages (published in 2000)by Lyons Press. With 195,000 books published last year, in my opinion, King's rehash is one we could have done without. If you want authenticy, immediacy and the real story; read Riley's own first-hand account not this on-looker's composited version."
1,Disappointed,"Perhaps it's somehow my fault, but this product did not meet my expectations. Bottom line is it didn't work for my DVI-I to analog connection. Make sure you do your homework before buying one of these adapters (DVI-I, DVI-A, DVI-D, DVI-?). Otherwise better off saving your money. Wish I did."
5,Best contemporary photo all in one book,this is contemporary photo. and there is plenty of it. great book.
2,King Of the Ring-Let down of the year!,There were a few problems with this PPV. First they wasted 7 matches on the tournament. They should have only showed the final 3. Second none of the action was really PPV quality. Some of it was cool but most of it was bland. The Table/dumpster match was ok(Road Dogg Put through 2 tables and Tori looked like she was going to puke after a powerbomb)but the audience expected much more. The title match was cool but why would 3 guys who all want the title be on one team? It make 0 sense! The tag team match was good(Lita gave Edge a killer huracanrana!). The best part was seeing Kurt Angle become the King Of the Ring! He is very deserving. When it comes out on tape rent it.
3,Rent dont Buy,"This DVD was only ok the match with the Hardyz was rely bad. the whole tournament including the winner was bad and the match when the two guys dress as a women was terrible The good things in the PPV were the table dumpster match, Road Dogg got Powerbombed threw Two Tables, X-pac Got Superplexed threw a table and Tori Got powerbombed threw a table. this match also includes the longest Wassssssssuuuuuuupppppp Drop to tori. The other good thing was a bump that Shane took. He got chokeslammed from the top rope to the outside threw the Spanish anounce table but this was only ok"
3,An alright PPV.,"This PPV sort of sucked. If your like me and a a big fan of the WWE and want to collect the old WWF type dvd's, this is a must have."
5,This charger is just what I wanted for traveling,Charges as well as a cradle but is much easier to carry around with me. I read ebooks while I am away from work or home and the batteries for my prisim wear out before I have a chance to get back. I recommend this for anyone who buys a visor and is not at the office every day.
3,IConcepts Portable Keyboard -- Usable but Disappointing,"I use this keyboard with my Palm 130. It's portable, and it works, despite the tendency to skip when typing on keys near the fold. However, I have been unable to find a compatible driver to operate Documents to Go version 4. This is a serious problem because tab, cut, paste, and other function keys don't work in this popular software program, meaning I'm left with two bad choices: Use Palm's memo pad software (which doesn't retain Word's formatting but works well with the keyboard), or use my stylus. Since I bought the keyboard for word processing on the Metro, I really miss the support for Documents to Go.... You get what you pay for."
1,"not happy, didn't work",I couldn' get the keyboard to work with my PALM 505. Some of the keys would work and some wouldn't. I have sent it back to AMAZON and so far I am unsure if they given me a refund/credit. I also attempted to use WEB site that was in user's guide and they couldn't help me.
5,MOTOWN VAULTS YIELD GOLD,"THIS CD RELEASE OF THE TEMPTATIONS IS ASTOUNDING FOR TWO REASONS: ONE, THE VERSATILLITY AND SKILL TO THRILL MANIFESTED BY THE GROUP RINGS OUT THROUGH EVERY TRACK.TWO; ONCE AGAIN, WE HEAR THE AMAZING DEPTHS OF TALENT BY MOTOWN'S WRITERS/PRODUCERS. EACH CUT IS ANOTER POSSIBLE HIT OR STIRRING LP TRACK. THE STANDOUTS ARE ""I'LL BE SATISFIED,"" AND THE HAUNTING ""DINAH,"" WHICH IS THE TYPE OF SONG THAT MAKES ITS FULL IMPACT ON YOU 2 SECONDS AFTER YOU HEAR IT (and you'll want to hear it again and again.)"
1,smelly,It has a strong rubberish smell even after washing. Never used so I don't know if this works for my son. Try Munchkin instead that does not have this smell.
4,Snack Trap,"At first my son had a hard time getting his little fingers out of the ""trap"" without pulling additional snacks out and i still had to pick up food but now he has the hang of it and not as much food ends up where is shouldn't be."
3,super cute but your taking a chance on colors ..,these are cute .. great but of course you could live with out more fun just to look at them .. function pretty well ..i only wish we did not have to take a chance on colors i bought these for my son and prayed that the boy colors would come in ..
1,"Doesn't trap the snacks, but traps the toys!","My twin 1yr olds both immediately figured out how to have fun by shaking out all their snacks, just hold down a flap. :) No ""snack trap"" there! And when the spilling is not going on they are using their new cups to trap their toys. At least they are good for something. :P"
2,Lid too firm,"I thought these snack traps would be perfect, but all they do is frustrate my daughter (14 mo). She has the dexterity, but the material on the lid is too firm I guess. She gets her hand in and then just won't pull past the teeth to get the food out. I've tried it over a few months with different tactics and each time I end up holding the flaps open so she can reach in (which defeats the purpose of her being able to self-feed with reduced mess). I'll be trying a new manufacturer for now and maybe when she's older these will work better."
2,waste of money,this didnt keep snacks from being all over the place. my child just thought it was a game to try to get the snacks out of the cup. waste of money.
3,Not a complete Bible,"I bought this expecting it to be a complete Bible with devotionals. Not so, It starts with Genesis chapter 3."
2,Guide to Jamming Review,This book is just ok. The information is good but not very deep. It lacks detail. It also only really talks about 1 form of music. An appendix will fundamental chord patterns for certain types of music would have been helpful as well.
2,Not user friendly-don't bother if you have Nextel Phones,"While this product works for most phones, it does not work for Nextel or services that lock out user features or ability to personalize a phone (unless one pays for buying a 10-15 second ring tone or other sound through the service provider.) I have not chosen to buy an unlock code for any of my phones. That is probably the only way one can get nearly full use of the software as it was designed to be used. Even when using the updates and upgrades, this program is still mediocre at best."
3,so-so,If you are just getting into trend trading then this may be a slighty motivational book for you. It is lacking on meat. No techniques are really described in full. I think that probably the most important point he makes in the book is that every trader has to find their own method. So if you are looking for a system move on. I guess ultimately I would have to rate this book pretty poorly.
1,Absolute Waste of your good money for this book,"Just fills the pages with total useless information. It is trying to fill up pages so it can be considered a book. The cover of book is misleading. I gained nothing from this book except a headache, and I assure you prospective new readers neither will you. I caution you, do not fall for the bait by its enticing title. Total rip off."
3,Great for beginners,"I believe this would be a great book for beginners. Parness has written an entertaining book that covers a lot of the basics on emotional control and money management in trading stocks for a quick profit. He explains the seven deadly sins of trading stocks that we must not commit:GREED, PRIDE, LUST, ENVY, GLUTTONY, SLOTH, and WRATH, plus FEAR. These are absolutely behaviors that will cause you to lose money in the markets. He advises of 5 ways NOT to find stock picks:Stock tips are for losers.Do not listen to idle chat from the hopeful and naive.Watch out for manipulation from pump and dumpers.Paid stock promoters. Analysts, etc.Do not trade OTC/BB stocksThe book was short on any kind of method to find stocks, and how to trade them. It just lays out the basics.Nice little book to get started with for beginners, but move on to read Alexander Elder's and William O' Neal's books they will take you the rest of the way."
3,This was one of the selections my husband,wanted and he read it. Can't say much more than that. He has asked me to order all of the Cramer books. Skip this one and get those.
2,basic info,"nothing real exciting. I thought I'd read his book after seeing the infomercial.very, very basic."
3,overrated and over-hyped book,"The book is repetitious of itself and of material offerred by other sources...there is very little new information, with the exception of the final chapter which does offer an interesting perspective of the author's trading philosophy. The book contains very little how-to information to help you duplicate the author's attention-grabbing success he refers to in his subtitle.I feel that the book is an indirect link to his over-priced website membership and products."
4,they absorb great,"ihave day accidents and i used to wear good nites at day but they just dont fit any more iwas at lunch and had a lot to drink i started to pee and it would just not stop it absorbed so much it just kept swelling and didn't even leak! iwas so happy because that saved me a lot of embarressment!!! it vswelled so much my button neven popped off. after lunch i went to the nurses office and changed it in her bathroom (she knew of course) and as i threw it away i said ""thanks again super plus absorbensy!"""
4,Very comfortable!,These things are very comfortable to wear! I use them for Airsoft as padding so that my stuff does not get shot off. I would suggest these to any one who would like to have padded underwear and if you even have a cup they will add some padding for you in the protection cup.
5,Kasparov Centurion Chess Computer,"Works great! Lots of fun! It also has a unique battery compartment that will not allow battery terminals to make contact with the circuitry if they are not inserted correctly.However, there was a bit of concern when nothing happened at the first attempt to turn the set on. As an electronics engineer, I found that a very popular brand of batteries that I was using were manufactured with a raised circle, divided into three equal segments, as part of the outer edge of the battery's negative contact. This raised circle had a nearly invisible clear plastic coating that kept the batteries from making electrical contact with the special terminals in the chess set. Scraping the plastic off the raised circles on the negative end of the batteries with a pocket knife made everything work fine."
5,You might like this even if you think you wouldn't,"I like this even though I don't generally like ""dance"" or ""electronic"" music, and didn't think the pre-Thrill band the Bogmen were very exciting. But hey, this has catchy tunes, weird space sounds (always good), a nice mix of live instruments and electronic effects, and Vic's singing and charisma could make even a record of emo music sound great!Now I will try to make some kind of ""music critic"" comparison, ummm... ""If the Neptunes produced 'Kid A' it might sound like this!"" Huh? How was that?"
5,Vic Thrill is Thrilltacular,"The amazing and electronic Vic Thrill will wow your ears, all two of them! Well, if you had three, it would please the third as well. Sometimes it takes a while to get into it, but once you figure it out, Vic Thrill is a golden gem that will light up your evenings, days, and nights."
4,Mini hot water bottle,"This works fine, but it's a bit small if you're looking for a regular sized one to cover a big achy belly, but perfect for a little tummy comforter."
5,ABSOLUTELY!,"Every cell in your body is made from what you eat,so absolutely nutrition makes a difference! I am a living testament to this. Am now in remission 5 yrs thanks to nutrition. And just completed a Masters in Holistic Nutrition so that I can help others the way I was helped.Get this book! Stop eating junk and non-nutrient processed foods ... get your life back!"
1,Not helpful,"The description of the book was lacking on the website; had it been more clear I would not have bought this book. There is very little detail on a good diet to follow in the book and it is basically a vegan diet. Don't waste your time on this book. It was just a lot of stories about people who have had success with managing their symptoms with a vegan diet. So, if you want to try it, just eat vegan. I returned this book immediately."
4,blast from the past,"i bought my sister an old sega genesis for christmas, as well as this game and streets of rage 2, they were our favorites growing up, anyway, it worked great as advertised.. have fun and enjoy watching camels spit when you jump on their backs."
1,Doesn't Work,"I wish I had read the other reviews. I spent hours trying to figure out what was wrong with my IPaq, I now realize it was this darn cable. Now I have to go try to buy another cradle, I would not recommend buying this."
1,It just doesn't work,I tried this product on three different computers and I cannot get the USB cable to work. The standard cradle for my Compaq iPaq 3875 works fine on all systems. This cord is junk.
1,Did not work,"Everytime I try to charge my Ipaq it locks up. And, it does not charge it. I have tried the wall and the car charger. Both give the same results."
3,WCP2,This is a good poker game. It has by far the best poker AI among games out right now. There are several flaws that keep the game from being as fun as it can be. It tends to take too long during hands you can't speed through the action. It forces you to play types of poker that you may not want to play like 5 card draw and pineapple. The pros rarely appear through the game and when they do they don't stand out anymore than anyone else. And the game has problems with freezing deep into tournaments. Overall the poker is fun but is held back by flaws.
4,Ram Memory,The increased speed going from 1 GB to 3 GB is excellent. The modules were easy to install.
3,Pretty Interesting,Though I am not an anime fan specifically I always appreciate the fact that they often contain many fascinating ideas and concepts. This one has Judeo Christion slant and involves prophecy. I don`t want to say much more cause I hate to spoil the plot but besides on sexually charged scence this movie could be veiwed by 10 years old an up. There is only 1 part where a parent should standby and hit the fast forward button.
5,Awesome retooling of a classic anime series,"This was a ton of fun to watch! I rewatched EVA on DVD just before watching 1.11. You Are Not Alone stays true to the original, cutting out some of the less important details and adding in plenty of awesome. I can't wait for the rest!"
5,Love the Reboot,"its a remake of the old classic, the visuals are better and the story a little more detailed in my opinion. the show later deviates further from the original story but in a good way. but 1.11 pretty much stays right on course with the first few episodes of the original. im really enjoying this reboot to the series and i expect all fans of the original will too. Amazon delivered a quality item quickly, and at a more then fair price"
4,Appaloosa by Brandon M. Moskos,"I pre-ordered this dvd, mainly because Viggo Mortensen is one of my favorite actors. This movie also had good reviews by the critics. I was extremely impressed on just how good this movie really is. This is a western about two men torn between the same woman. I really don't like to tell too much about the movie in my reviews, but this is a definite must-see movie. It is kind of long, but that is the only flaw."
5,very good,"This movie dissapointed many people because it was not very romantic in its veiws. It shows the tough life on the frontier for both women and men and the reasons for their choices. I found it very believable and just a great story overall. I pondered what the two friends said and shared and also their interactions with the women. Although I claim to be no genious, I thought the movie to be very deep. I think it could be discussed for many hours in any sociology class."
3,overall a disappointment,This movie starts off with a mediocre plot at best and the end is fairly anticlimactic and a disappointment. The cast is excellent and there is no doubt they have talent but the storyline fell extremely short.
1,"Great Cast, Dreadful Movie. and what the hell happened to Zellweger's face?","This movie had good elements that never came to fruition. It was really quite dull with little action. As soon as Zellweger came on screen with her million dollar facial plastic surgery failure, I knew the movie was doomed. I love both Harris and Mortenson, but not in this awful excuse for a western."
1,APPAPOOOPA,"I usually enjoy the three main actors. Especially, Harris. But the story is bad, poorly presented and the direction is terrible. Harris needs to stick to acting. Westerns need to make a comeback but this one sets them back and would keep younger viewers from ever wanting to see another one. This is an insult to the classic westerns."
3,Ed Harris shines.,"Of all films I have seen involving Ed Harris, it is this particular film where he showed his mettle and I think that's because he gets more screen time here than ever. This film is very engaging and his character is a complex one, the dialogues are spoken with an accent that takes a bit of time to catch up with. I've always been a big Viggo Mortensen fan and I think he rocked in his performance of the supporting actor. The of-late seldom seen, Renee Zellweger, acted quite well to giving the film an interesting storyline. While Appaloosa is much better than many lukewarm films I've seen in the recent past, it does get slightly weary towards the middle and end. Also, because it is a Western and involves a lot of action, keep your logic in the closet and watch."
4,Classic western,"If you like Ed Harris or Viggo Mortensen, you'll like this western. Both are low-key but intense. Could have done without Renee Z., but you can't have everything. :)"
4,Great film but terrible DVD transfer,"So much time and effort was put forth in the making of this production.The sets, costumes, acting, were all superb.Why would New Line put both a full and windscreen version on the same side, resulting in a very poor DVD transfer.Hope a better copy comes out in the future."
2,Good character development + Little action + Dragging and dragging = It's not fun to watch,It contains good character development. However it has little action and it drags on and on. Watching this is like reading a textbook. You know it's meaningful but it's not fun at all.
5,Appaloosa,"Appaloosa is a great movie, made in the same way as great movies like ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"". The historical accuracy is excellent. An old guy like me who has grown up watching great westerns (and some bad ones) can really appreciate the attention to detail in the set, the clothing and weapons, the tack on the horses and the acting. This is truly one of best movies to come out of Hollywood in a long time. It's also nice that this movie was made here in the US. (not that some of the ones made in Canada weren't good.) This is one DVD I will definately add to my collection.The only thing I can say that I would like to have been different.....I would love to have been an extra!"
5,20000 Leagues Under the Sea,This is good family entertainment with great songs. The child actors and a script that isn't dumbed-down are at least two of the reasons this video is one of my sons' (ages 4 and 6) continual favorites.
4,works for me,"i do own the hp dv9030us for a year now, upgraded to vista home premium, and so far no problems at all!!!my only problem is with hp's customer support, they suck big time,but i think that if u know how to work out your problems without help from best buy or paying money for some dude to install the software for you...u can go along with it.my only problme now: no hp quick launch support for vista..."
3,"Beautiful, But Very, Very Narrow","I normally wear a size 7-1/2 or 8 M in a sandal, and have several pair in that size. While shopping online for black sandals for an upcoming wedding, I came across these. They're beautiful at a great price and arrived in record time. Unfortunately, they're so narrow I could barely get my foot into them at the toe. With them finally squeezed on (and hoping maybe they could stretch), I realized as beautiful as they are, they're simply too narrow to be comfortable... even just so stand in. If you have a very narrow foot, they'll likely be perfect for you! If you have an average foot, they'll almost certainly be too tight. Mine will be going back. Kudos to Amazon for speedy shipping and a wonderful return policy!"
4,Bust a Move 4,"I am still not sure what I think about bust a move in general, but my mom loves it. She claims this version is not as good as the super nintendo original, but it still has her hooked to my game boy (which is better than being hooked to the TV all the time.) Irregardless, if you liked the other bust a move games this one will be enjoyed as well."
4,Great Book,"This book was great, I just couldnt put it down but the ending kind of leaves you hanging so I give it 4stars."
1,Author Hates the Military,"I find it hard to believe I finished reading this book. It is one of the worst books I have read.The author obviously hates the military and believes they are all baby killers. Almost every time someone in the military is referenced the author uses some pejorative adjective to define them.The author feels that the military is incapable of anything good. The military are presented as kill happy automatons. But even though they are kill-happy, the military are not capable of keeping anyone in a prison cell. The number of prison escapes without any of the prisoners being hurt is another reason I hold this book in contempt. The non-military characters in the book can literally walk out of any prison without anyone noticing for hours.Avoid this book. It is not worth using as toilet paper."
5,Worth every penny!!! LOVE IT!,"I originally bought the Alpha Omega Elite Car seat for my 1 year old son. I returned it for a few reasons (can read on my other review). I ended up paying a little more for the Decathlon Convertible and it was the best buy ever! I love it, but most importantly my son loves it! The only time he cries in his car seat is when he's tired and ready to take his nap. Before he used to cry non-stop until we purchased this Decathlon! What I love most about it is that when he falls asleep his head doesn't flop foward! It stays in place. I love it! I intend to buy this car seat for all my future kids!"
1,Don't buy,"The flatware looks good, but within one year of everyday use, the knives all broke away from the handle. Very poor quality construction."
2,absolute boring,Maybe not bad as background music but definately not the connosoir's choice of good jazz. NC is an average guitar player and definately not the Larry Carlton or Lee Rittenoir!The numbers also are very boring. Same percussive intros and boring repetitive tempos.Absolute waste of money!
4,"KitchenAid Burnished Dough Hook. ""Kind of"" fits.","Another example of the pitfalls of online purchasing, when you reside in a foreign country. (Very difficult to make exchanges.)Unlike the KA Burnished Flat Beater, the Dough Hook fits, but not satisfactorily. It will mix and knead dough, but not as effectively as the old, coated dough hook which it was intended to replace. It simply does not extend far enough toward the bottom of the bowl."
1,didn't fit,"it is very challenging to buy the proper replacement parts for kitchenaids.just saying I failed on this one, and not worth returning....."
5,Luck of the draw?,"It seemed many of the reviews here are negative. However, it's served me well so far(knock on wood.) I purchased this for my aging mother & she has used it everyday for 2+months, about 30 minutes each use. She uses it as part of her therapy.The lowest setting seems a bit useless & the highest seems warm enough. However, I do believe the level of warm is highly subjective. Not being the first Homedics product I have owned, I also feel that their their manufacturers' quality control vary greatly.For myself, I consider this purchase to be well worth it & I do believe that given the nature of this product, it will not last forever.If you do chose to try this product out, I hope you end up with a good one too. *fingers crossed*"
3,Not the best choice for big kids,"I bought this carseat for my four-year-old daughter after carefully reviewing all options. I am a fan of Britax and had been very happy with the Roundabout, so i bought the Marathon because I liked that I could keep her in a five-pt harness a bit longer. The seat installed easily and was very secure in the car. However, whenever my daughter gets in, it is almost impossible for her to do so without sitting on the bottom buckle. I then have to reach under her to pull out the bottom buckle, which is awkward. She is small and thin for her age, but even so, the crotch buckle is very close-fitting. Since she wears skirts and dresses more than pants, she then has to pull her skirt up over her waist in order to expose the bottom buckle so I can snap it; then travel with her skirt all bunched up the whole way and her panties showing. Needless to say, she was very unhappy about that! I am going to return it and get something a little more suited to a kid, not a baby."
4,Satisfied with my purchase,Book is in very good condition without any damage.Delivery was within a week.
3,Not the Typical Perspective - Perhaps.,"Topper (1937) has one of the most unusual cars preserved on film. Obviously poking fun at the famous ""Boattail Auburn Speedster"", the Kerbys' car was actually a 1936 Buick Series 80 Roadmaster with some custom bodywork (courtesy of Wikipedia). Cary Grant, Constance Bennett, and Roland Young launch the ""Topper"" franchise which I think of as a prequel to the 1955 television show also called ""Topper"".One thing that the two films have in common besides Roland Young is very beautiful leading ladies. Constance Bennett, who started acting in the '20's reflects the beautiful woman of the that era. Carole Landis who is the original ""One Million BC"" girl is a beauty that's almost totally forgotten. I may be her last fan. (And Anne Jeffreys typified the '50's beauty in the television show.)The story and the novelty of ghosts that can only be seen and heard by Cosmo Topper, is the reason these films are so well liked."
2,Pass this one up,"If this version of Topper and Topper returns is the best they have to offer it ""Forget about it"". First off the cover says nothing about Topper returns but when you load it in your player it shows that both movies are on the DVD. These transfers are horrible. Its like a very poor VHS print. It would cost almost as much to return it so I'll keep it till a better one comes along. Pass this one up unless your like me, an ardent Cary Grant Fan.The movies are great but this copy is &$*#@*"
3,textbook,The textbook is all black and white. Hard to study . But does have all necessary info. I used it just fine in the class.
3,A different take on the platformer genre,"It's such an obvious idea, I'm surprised no one has thought of it before: a game that plays like a comic book where you are in the panels and each page is a level. It has neat little features like how enemies are drawn into the page and you can choose different paths, but where the game falls short is in the gameplay. All it consists of is punch-punch-kick again and again; it gets old and doesn't allow for strategy or skill. It also doesn't help that the story and music are weak, not to mention that this game is atrociously difficult."
1,Poor writing and even worse - a boring story...,"I had hoped, from the reviews and the description of this book, to read a witty, ironic novel a la High Fidelity. I didn't even finish it. The writing was 11th grade English class dialogue, but even worse were the characters - I couldn't have cared less about them. It was a disappointment - what a funny book this could have been."
5,THIS BOOK ROCKS!,"Ms. kennedy is an artist and she creates a masterpiece of language everytime she decides to use a pen. I am a huge fan and I hope she continues to write amazing novels. You can feel the emotion of the characters, as if they were your own."
5,Perfect baking cookbook,"Every recipe I have made from this book (over 30) has worked perfectly. The directions are impeccable. I've made cakes, cookies, pies, quick breads, yeast breads, frostings and sauces from this book. Each one has worked every time. The hot fudge sauce is spectacular as are the gingersnap cookies. When I bought this book several years ago, I knew how to make chocolate chip cookies; I was not an experienced baker. I followed Ms. Cunningham's master recipes to learn how to bake, and now I have a reputation as a great baker. You can't go wrong baking with Marion Cunningham as your guide."
4,best baking book I own,I own several books on baking but I always refer to this one in the end. I highly recommend the coffee cakes which are lovely!
5,"excellent, beautifully written","Mother Earth Spirituality is a necessary addition to the shelves of anyone who wants to learn how to live in harmony with Mother Earth and all Her inhabitants. It is a beautifully written, clearly defined book that explains some of the major concepts of Lakota spirituality and how they can be applied in our world today. It will also increase your awareness of the struggle the Indians endure to hold on to their traditional ways. The author's account of his Sun Dance experiences illustrate a part of this struggle. This book will increase your awareness and strengthen your bond with Mother Earth and all her creatures, including humans. Its wonderful!"
2,Rich with rituals,"I read this book right after reading Stone Age Wisdom by Tom Crocket. I believe with many others here that Native American ways of living have much to offer us. I am a firm believer that their ways are highly superior in many ways to our Western ways. I am always on the look out for great wisdom, tradition and customs of our first founding fathers.The highlights of this book are the rituals and ceremonies. The author goes into great details on ceremonies for the earth, making the pipe, and building a sweat lodge. My favorite parts were in the introduction with the letter of Chief Seathl in 1854. Everyone needs to read this letter. And the other part was Catlin's creed. Go buy this book and read them and study them.As the other book, I was looking and expecting something else. This book is filled with rituals and ceremonies and if that is your cup of tea then this book is for you. I gained some understanding of these rituals and have come to appreciate them more."
5,"This is a classic ""must read"" for following the Red Road.","Eagle Man has taken a brave step forward in this book, sharing insights on the sacred Lakota ceremonies with novices and non-Indians. This is an excellent book for anyone just beginning to travel on the Good Red Road, and as an added bonus it is imminently readable and beautifully illustrated."
5,Mother Earth Spirituality is a great and generous gift,"In Mother Earth Spirituality, Ed McGaa (Eagle Man) writes: ""For Indians, four-legged and winged ones, stones, and trees are regarded as holy, in that they harmoniously live upon this earth, following exactly the plan of the Great Spirit."" Reading this book was itself a spiritual experience, a revelation of the Great Spirit. I was informed, inspired, moved, and also brought to grief over what had been missing from my own life: the closeness to Mother Earth that the author so clearly and powerfully feels. By describing Oglala Sioux spirituality and philosophy from the inside, Ed McGaa has given us a great and generous gift. I owe him a debt of gratitude for reminding me of what I must recover. If humanity is to have a future, it will have to learn the lessons and absorb the wisdom of this important book."
1,Just passing along advise from professionals,"I haven't tried this myself, so I'm just passing along this info:This product was one of the losers in the Cook's Country TV test of various pie plates. Here is a quote from their website: ""The perforated shield/pie weight conducted heat too well and overbrowned the blind-baked crust. The nonstick coating scratched deeply at the first cut."""
1,Interesting at times,"Nice insight for First Call fans. Overall, it's somewhat depressing in her portrayal of being single. There is more of a victim mentality then a true sense to reach out to others going thru similar experiences. Not sure where ""ministry"" comes in between the numerous stories of her kids and intense longing for a husband. Blessed are the ""depressing""??"
2,It's ok,This game was cheap ya but the shipping is what gets your money this game is a bit too easy for my liking and you go nowhere.
4,Healing Light,Excellent transaction with the seller. I haven't gotten into the book too much as of yet but I know that healing with light is the medicine of the future.
2,"I Feel Like Sisyphus, Rolling a Rock Up a Hill Eternally.","Yes, this game is one of the most pointless games ever. I bought it for childhood nostalgia value. Now let's be real, getting a wife, fishing, and building up ones farm can be pretty fun in Harvest Moon but after you get over that point you begin to think ""what's next?"". The scenery is great! but the camera is permanently focused on the ground so you can't enjoy it! The music is changeable, but the few songs still all get stale. Don't sell your cow! Because if you want a new one for milk you have to wait over a year before it starts! I gave up on this game the third month of the first year. Luckily it's so cheap."
4,More work than Back to Nature.,"This game loses it's fun factor because it's so much work. Back to Nature and Harvest Moon 64 were challenging but not overly done in the labor department. I'm having a hard time enjoying this game just because of how much fishing I have to do to make money to buy more items for the farm, which also require work to use. The characters are a little harder to win over as well. I love the franchise but I'll have to keep searching through the HM titles because it's getting old real quick."
5,Great game,This is such a good game. A lot better then a wonderful life in many ways. the only problem is that it is too dark in the morning i cannot see my way to the barn. Otherwise this game rules
3,Harvest Moon AWL Special Edition,"AWL Special Edition has some fun bonuses that the original doesn't have, including a different horse, a shipping bin for crops to give you more profit, and a chance to marry Lumina. These are great additions, but... the graphics aren't so good, as in the game seems laggy and almost slow-motion. Also, you have to grow the pasture to get more fodder for the animals, like in Another Wonderful Life, and the big field with very fertile soil has been turned into a forest, giving less room for crops. A Wonderful Life has never been one of the most fun Harvest Moon games, but it is still an okay game. The biggest pain I have experienced playing it is the lagginess. I don't know if it's just my ps2 or the game..."
1,"Good idea, terrible result","Terrible book overall. If you ar a begginer, then run away because samples that do not even compile. If you an average then you should also skeep it because when you find code that compiles, it will not run (GPFs and such). If you an advanced programmer, then you would be upset that most of the book seems to be dealing with too basic of the stuff. As an example I tried to build water example. I spend half an hour first configuring project, so that it would compile, then running it under BounceChecker to discover where it GPFs, and finally getting it to run, just to see some garbage. If I find it on some going out of bussiness sale for 5$ I might buy it (it has some interesting concepts for water and fire), but never for a higher price."
1,"Badly written ""Acknowledgements""","As an educated person, I am shocked, appalled and dismayed to find so many divine references in the Acknowledgment section of the book. Ellen writes ""... Thank God for family!... Thank God for friends!... Thank God for publicity!... Thank God for attorneys who have faith in me!... Thank God for helpers!... Thank God for professionalism!... Thank God for people"". I was nauseated after reading just the Acknowledgment section. Not sure I can carry on reading the rest of the book."
1,what the hell?,"this is the worst book i have ever read in my entire life, and i read a lot. This author needs to end her career, today. This book is pointless, and has not end. DO NOT READ IT."
1,the woman in the box,i read this book eighteen years ago and haven't left the house since. i am writing this review from the box. i have become what i most feared. fasj jsdn u ud x c ttt o . . *
1,Traumatized 15 years later,"I read this book when I was 12, and it's left a lasting impression all these years- I'm almost 30 now. That's not a compliment. As an adult, I realize that life is full of unexplained, meaningless tragedy, but the way this book wallows in it is prurient and grotesque. A hardened adult would be stupified by the ending where a child dies alone of starvation and thirst. But to aim this at children? It is cruel beyond all understanding. Not because I think children and teens can't accept death- Bridge to Terabethia was one of the most beautiful books I ever read. But this was like the Saw movies for the middle school set- long, drawn out psychological torture for no reason, with no purpose or redeeming value. Those reviews about the ""clarity of mind"" she experiences are bulls**t. Wouldn't recommend to my worst enemy. Would love to ask the author, WTF?"
1,despicably horrid,"I read this book about five years ago and I still remember how much I hated it. A girl, for no known reason, gets kidnapped and locked in a cellar with her typewriter and her thoughts. How often does something like that happen? Also, it just ended, and you just have to assume she dies, because her water and stale doughnuts are almost gone. This book was so incredibly stupid. I would not recommend this to anyone except those who enjoy boring, depressing stories that have no end."
1,Never Arrived,"I ordered this product on Nov 5th of 2006. It still has not arrived. When I ordered the product, it was in stock with an expected delivery of two weeks. Amazon now believes that the diaper bag will arrive at the end of February or early March. This is also a product that is supposedly sold directly through Amazon. One would think that they would have better inventory control over their own merchandise, but apparently not."
3,Adventures of Batman And Robin,Its actully a pretty good game i think u should realy get it it i mean its fun chalinging and cool try it trust me !!!
2,Dont waste your money,"Dont waste your money on this. It looks gorgeous, but it's simply not functional and is poorly made. We received this dresser in the mail last week, to complete our baby's bedroom. It matches the crib and changing table. However, the dresser is not made well, and is not functional. The sides of the dresser seem to be too far apart for the drawers to comfortably glide, so one side or another is not connected. We put it together and took it apart three different times, thinking we had done something wrong....no such luck. My husband had to put wood shims on the sides to narrow the space. It's a temporary fix, but not one that should have to be done for a $300 dresser. Amazon is sending me a new one, and hopefully it will work better than the first. Regardless, unless you have the time to send one back and get a replacement, find something else. I hate to say that, because the furniture is beautiful, but not worth the hassle."
1,made out of lead,"Fogeddaboutit! These pedals are rediculously heavy, did not install and would have returned but too much of a hassle."
3,Poor...,"Don't buy this book if you want to learn to care for your clownfish, or sea anemones. It is only marginally good at identification, and is sparse on content about selection, care, feeding, etc. The pictures/illustrations are pathetic, and it also has a bunch of ""unnecessary"" information about how to care for a marine aquarium. I didn't buy the book to learn how to take care of an aquarium. I bought the book to learn how to take care of clownfish and anemones. This book looks like a book that was published in 1973 and has been sitting on the shelf of your public library since then."
5,Superb boook on folk toys,This book provides easy to follow instructions for making: 1. Yugoslavia: five dolls 2. Philippines and Greece: yo-yo 3. New Zealand: thunderbolt 4. New Mexico: bull roared 5. Austria: tumbling man 6. West Indies: twirling yo-yo 7. PreColumbian Americas: spear-the-fish game 8. Portugal: balancing fisherman 9. Israel: Haman knocker 10. Venezuela: corn cob donkey 11. China: flip ball 12. France: the hangman's noose 13. Japan: daruma dollas 14. Finland: prisoner's lock 15. Java: shadow puppet 16. Uganda: thumb piano 17. United Arab Republic: sagat player 18. USSR: Russian bear 19. Poland: pecking birdAbsolutely wonderful.
5,God's Wisdom!,"I am finally losing fat! I found this book one afternoon in a bookstore just when I was at the end of my dieting rope...frustrated in the fact that I was trying to change my diet, but not getting anywhere in the fat loss department. I tried low carb, low sugar (which are both good, just not the total answer for me), and other approaches, although still eating some whole grain breads and crackers and other whole grain, but man made products. After much prayer, I found this book and I am now losing fat steadily after removing these whole grain-but man made items. I eat balanced meals, I'm never hungry, have lots of energy and I'm finally sleeping well! God's Diet is easy to shop and cook on, and easy to stay on for my busy soccer mom schedule. I have found my answer....and God in His wisdom knew what to do all the time!"
4,"Not a guidebook, but a good source for getting a feel for freighters","If you're curious about what a trip by freighter would be like then this is the book for you. Although a bit unpolished and with grammatical errors still in place, Hartley's book gives an honest, straightforward account of his round-the-world trip aboard a container ship. In the process you learn some practical lessons of how to travel by freighter, like keeping a map around to track your progress and bringing your own face towel and how port agents might be your best bet for getting into town (or not). I am still looking for a book on the more practical aspects of freighter travel but I'm glad I got this one. If I ever do make the trip it will at least in part be due to this book."
4,Fun book.,"I felt like I was a part of his adventure while reading this book. The book is very low-key, and perhaps low-brow, but that's what freighter travel is about."
5,"A MUST READ for all survivors, parents and caregivers.","America has a secret hidden epidemic lurking, protected and secure, in the American family home. It is child sexual abuse. The strength and courage of one woman to tell her brutal story will give everyone who reads it an understanding of child molestation necessary to change this cycle of abuse carried through generations and generations. Comprehension of this unspeakable crime will get people speaking. Rhonnie speaks about her own abuse and I could not stop reading. Through the tears and the anger, I kept reading. After reading her story, I wanted to cup my hands around all the abused and neglected children of the world. Thank you Rhonnie for this eye-opening, riveting book."
4,"Interesting, but maybe not Practical","I've enjoyed this book and found it an interesting read. The author does offer some good ""thrifty living"" advice throughout the book as well.However, some of this book is more radical than most people might be willing to follow. We are a family with several young children - we aren't really up for moving away from all family, Church, and friends to live in a remote rural location. Nor would we be willing to convert an old bus into a home for our family. We aren't willing to give up basic utilities either. And as far as squatting on someone else's land and hiding our camp... well, let's just say that's not very practical with toddlers. :)So, I think this book may be somewhat useful to families who are trying to live a thrifty existence and avoid the consumer trap. But at the same time, much of the advice may be too extreme for most people.Its worth reading though, and I found the author's wry, conversational style writing entertaining and easy to read."
2,There's no reason to pay for common sense,"If you are interested in learning about frugal living, start by passing up this book. While Romney's effort has some interesting sections, the material is a little dated. Besides, it just seems anyone with a dollup of common sense could do just as well on their own."
2,It wasn't all that ...,"It's not like me to write a negative review about a book because, after all, we can find good in anything if we look, right? Well, I'm not discrediting there is some good points in this book, but I had two issues. First, the author seems to rant and go on diatribes from time-to-time that did not add any value to my reading experience. A good writer should present the information in such a way as to invoke the reader to that diatribe, not to have to read about it. Second, the author made far too many claims without examples of how to do it. Almost like he could TELL you what to do or how you should live, but he hasn't actually done it himself. And, that fact greatly reduced his credibility with me. Also, the author makes claims that are easily recognizable as just flatly not doable. I didn't find this to be a practical application. I'm sorry for being so negative but I was disappointed I spent the money for this book."
2,Fun but a Lil complicated,if ur a racing fan u will like this game but in between each racing game u have to solve a puzzle and if u want to go to the next level and make ur car better u have to win money and it takes a while to get it done. ive been playing this game for about two years and sooner or later ur going to lose intrest and ur gonna have to have tons of patience:(:(I hope this helped u:)
2,Dubious Conspiracy Theories,"This book looks appealing at first glance, as it includes essays by Chomsky, Zinn and Parenti. However, lumped in with these scholars are some questionable ""truths"" such as gun control increases crime and the environmental movement is lying to you. Many of the sources for these dubious statistics are not even cited.Many of these ""truths"" rely on fallacious cause and effect scenarioes that would make a pre-schooler skeptical. I was extremely disappointed with the overall content of this book, Chomsky, Zinn, and Parenti aside."
3,A Brief and Outdated Summary,"We purchased this book in Spring 2003, even though the book was published in 2001. West Nile Virus has spread across the United States and much has been learned since the book was published. The book is an interesting historical reference, but for more complete and up-to-date information look elsewhere. For example, the U.S. Center for Disease Control has a good website with current information."
3,Good book but incomplete,"The author is very good in explaining the core concepts and desings to build and maintain a 2D video game in Java. The explanations are very clear and the code is very clean too. The concepts that are demonstrated are rock solid to produce high quality games.The cons about this books is that many essential concepts in game devevelopment are not covered such as artigicial intelligence, sound/music and tools to build game content (levels...)Also I don't think it is a good idea to teach the Java language in this book. I think this subjet should be left to many other good books.Finally, the author focuses too much on the aspect of online gaming. All the concepts are based on Applets and when the time comes to create a game for the desktop there are differences on how to build the framework.I you are looking for game programming in Java you will learn very good and essential concepts with this book but be aware that it is incomplete."
2,To bad...,"Unfortunately, this book suffers from the same problem as many other Java books. The author believed it necessary to explain what Java is in the first 8 chapters, instead of assuming some previous knowledge on the subject (there are plenty of better books out there on beginning Java). Game programming is an indepth field, and unfortunately is not covered in-depth in this book. There are many in-depth books for C, C++ on the subject, but as of yet, none to count for in Java. There are a few games published using Java out there, eg: Vampire:The Maquerade, Roboforge, etc. Maybe the developers for those game should write a book, as of now it's still a neech market."
3,"Okay, But Doesn't Fit All 8-Inch Pans...","This is a sturdy, heavy quality lid, but it does not fit all 8-inch pans. I have several different brands and it did not fit any of them, so I sent this back and bought a universal lid. Also, if you plan on using this on a non-stick pan that you do not wish to scratch, you will probably want a different lid. This one has a FOLDED under edge around the top which is very sharp. For the right pan this is great, just didn't work for me."
3,The product needs an upgrade for OS compatibility,Visual Statistics CDROM needs an upgrade both in terms of visual appeal (as seen in some screenshots) and more importantly OS compatibility. The content has to be great and worth purchasing since it is recommended so highly by the academia. The version available does not install properly on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Vista Business. Unfortunately I could not use it and hence returned the item.I think the authors should look at creating a web version of the same. That can be accessed as a paid e-learning tutorial. I am from a New Delhi based IT company and we can help them create a web version and architect the same if they are interested. This can give better reach to students and also centralized update of content will be possible.
4,A great game but too many of these kinds of games exist,"This is a good game which I still find fun to play. The only problem with it is that too many of these ""beat people up while you are walking down the street"" games exist. I think this is one of the best games in it's class. It just came out so late that people had already played too many games like it already."
3,Did not come with case but the game works and was here fast.,I love them game and it works good. I was just hoping that it would come with a case like what is shown on the advertisement.
5,Working as intended.,"Pros: No issues whatsoever.LengthGold plated connection for laughs :)Cons: none.I gave it 5 star because it's doing it's job just fine. Bought it June 25, 2012 and writing this review in December so durability is fine, no degradation in quality or anything."
4,Docu-Surf,"Not quite what I was expecting but still a good flick! Maybe I don't know what I expected but this seemed a little more spartan and sanitary than other women's surf vidz I'd seen before. Made up of various interviews entwined with random footage - all of which were well shot and thought out. I was kinda bummed to see so much of the film with ladies poured into their wetsuits. Don't get me wrong - not a 'perv' or anything like that but most will admit that wetsuits aren't that glamorous and if I remember correctly the purpose of such videos is to promote the glamorous and exotic sport of the ""Ali'i""...other than that, I enjoyed the production. I really liked the fact that the interviews were peer oriented with the gals sharing how they felt about the various other ladies in the video."
2,not as tasty as I thought would be!,"disappointed about this, I was really expected something else, kind of strange taste, I would definitely not buy again. sorry!"
1,DO NOT BUY!,"I bought this hub less than 2 months ago. It has stopped working! If I plug it in, it is no longer powered.DO NOT BUY THIS P.O.S.!!"
3,Belkin FireWire 6-Port Hub,I returned this item because it did not support 800 FireWire for my MacBook Pro. I felt that the add was somewhat misleading in that it did not specifically mention FireWire 400 only.
1,Don't buy it,This is the worst frig ever. Mine caught fire. Called support and they said we will send someone out Tuesday (3 days later). Front control died just after two months. This is a real bad product. Shame on you Sears. Stick to tools.
3,stylish noise box,"I gave this a 3 because it does its job and looks nice doing it. The biggest problem though is the noise. It spends half the day making a vibrating noise, but worse it is not constant. We have had the fridge almost 1 year and we have the Maytag repair people out twice to investigate the issue and both times they made minor adjustments and then the noise came back as soon as they left.Despite the noise it does its function (so far at least) and it looks nice. We get many compliments on the look, but we didn't buy it to look at! I have a hard time with larger items (like 2 liter bottles) and often wind up laying them down on a shelf inside the fridge. I love the deli drawer and how it goes across the width of the fridge and I like the drawers in the freezer, although tall or bulky items become an issue again."
4,Exciting And Fun!!!,"I'll Tell You One Thing, This Game Is A Blast! I Got It When I Was Around 9-10 Years Old And I Loved It! I Still Play It To This Day, I Never Get Tired Of It! If Your Like Me And You Go Crazy Over The Tv Show (Oh Yes I Still Watch It) Then You'll Go Bannans Over The Game! Its Very Very Detailed, And True To The Show. Its Not A Kiddie Game Either (Even Tho Kids Will Love It Too) Im A Teenager And I Still Play It And So Does My 35 Year Old Sister! Its Rather Hard At Times Tho, Always Difficult To Find Things. But Its Always Worth It. Get This Game, You'll Love It!"
2,"Mistitled, alas","After reading the reviews I wanted to love this cookbook and eagerly awaited its arrival. So I was quite disappointed to discover the recipes are vegan, not vegetarian. (Unless I missed it, there's nary a dairy ingredient in sight. Or type.) Since I run away screaming from soy cheese products and the like, Max and Rosie's isn't gonna replace Moosewood for me any time soon.The minestrone recipe looks luscious, however. But I'll be adding on the Parmesan... ."
1,Defective K-cups,My son & I both have been experiencing leakage of the grounds from the timothy's K-cup into the brewed coffee. Eww! Coffee this expensive should not have this problem.
2,Fancy name; boring coffee,"I've found Timothy's K-cups to be consistently good, better than the Green Mountain varieties I've tried (with the G.M. exceptions of Nantucket and Newman's Own.) But Parisian Night is the first Timothy's offering that didn't impress me. I bought two boxes of it from Amazon and have tried using different brew strengths, but it always tastes bland. It's bold and strong as advertised, but plebeian. To someone who's just bought a Keurig and had this blend as their first cup, it might taste pretty good; but compared with all the other, better K-cup varieties that are available, this one is better off skipped. I think it's just a fancy name for a boring blend that has nothing distinctive about it at all. Their ""Midnight"" dark roast is definitely more tasty, and even better than that are their Columbian and Italian K-cups, which are very smooth. I think Timothy's has the best Columbian K-cups on the market. But Parisian Night, well...let's just say that everybody makes mistakes!"
1,"Great Taste, Serious Flaw","I loved the flavor of this coffee....I have tried many flavors/brands over the past few months and I truly did love this coffee. MY PROBLEM with this coffee is that I spent $20 for 50 pods....out of the 50 pods, I might have only gotten 30 ""drinkable"" cups of coffee. I kept getting grounds in my cup. It wasnt the machine because I tried other brands/flavors and it didnt happen with those. ONLY the Parisian Nights! (AND YES, I know how to operate the machine AND NO, I didnt ""open"" the pods) I was so disappointed. As much as I LOVED the flavor, I would never purchase this product again....I couldnt stand the gamble of whether I would get a good cup of coffee! I am not a big fan of GROUNDS in my coffee!"
2,"It works, but...","This unit charges up my CF-T2 laptop OK, but the plug does not seem to insert all the way. Also, unlike the original Panasonic device, this unit's cord sticks straight out from the plug, while the Panasonic had a right angle plug, much reducing the stress on the cord and mor importantly, the laptop. I will look for a unit that fit better and reduced stress if/when I buy this again."
4,Classicks,So I bought this game at a local Game store and was alittle on edge about itSeeing 3 in 1 on an old skool title just didn't sound appealing but this is perfect2 great sonic games (And Mean bean machine) All in this 1 cart all games play full speedand zero graphic problems as far as i'm concerned it's better to own each cart individuallybut this is a good sub for people who like to save space.
5,A great collection of songs a Must have,"I bought this CD for my wife, she loved the compilation of songs that this one CD has. The sound is great, and seeing him live is even more spectacular."
1,Would Not Work:(,We have this game for our PS2 and I thought it would be fun to buy it for my son's xbox. It wouldn't play. I have no idea why. The player is less than a year old and plays all other games fine. I'm not sure if it is a defect or that it won't play on a newer xbox. I would just wanted to caution a potential buyer. The PS2 version is great though!
1,Not XBOX Compatable,"Was very excited when it arrived, and on time. Dissappointed though that it is not campatable with the latest XBox version.Am considering and external h Drive Like it suggests....."
2,waste,"This game DOES NOT work on XBOX 360. So, it was a waste for me to even by it. If this would have been specified when it was sold, then I would not have even bought it! But oh well!! Now I know."
3,Nice pot!,"Nice pot. Good quality. But can't hold the leaves. Works better for bagged teas. But for traditional Chinese teas, it's not very useful."
4,Snug fit for my Z5fd,Pro-snug fit keeps a very slim profile.Con-slow and difficult to quickly get the camera out of the case.
4,remember that old blue hedgchog and his buddy tails who obviosly had a crush on him,"remember the days when sonic had the finest graphics in the world well 2d or not even today id take sonic over quit a few xbox or ps2 games because sonic had so much class i mean hes a blue hedgechog who has a super saign {i dont know which one was made first sonic or dragonball z}. even though it had a lack of plot or how sega recycle a lot of the levels it was sheer brilliance i mean i used to love sonic and was sad when sega stopped making game consoles {i mean think of the classics alex kidd, eco the dolphin,soul calibur and lets never and i mean never forget kid chameleon}well no matter how old i get ill never forget when that little blue hedchog was revolutionary in terms of graphics,sound and length."
4,Great Historical Fiction,"I didn't think I would enjoy this story as much as I did. Fire by Night is the moving story of two different women from different backgrounds during the Civil War. One is a wealthy socialite who wants to find meaning in her life aside from tea parties and dinner parties. The other, a strong tom-boy with no parents and her brothers gone off to war, she decides to disguise herself as a man and join the army. This was a moving story depicting the horror of war and terrible loss of life, but also of finding yourself and making your life matter. And of course, there's a great love story as well."
2,Not worth the money,"I was excited to get this book, hoping for some great ideas for meals for one. Instead what I got was a book with plenty of ""dip"" recipes and salad dressing recipes. Also a section on the cooking of plantains. There is one recipe with beef (ground beef with frozen veggies... yum! not!) and one with chicken. Save your money and forget this book. I may just return it and get my money back."
1,No nutritional information!,How can a book that proclaims itself as a healthy cookbook not have any nutritional information on any of the recipes? There were very few (black and white!) pictures and all the recipes seemed boring and uninspired. I would not recommend this book to anyone that likes food.
1,Do not waste your time,"I cannot say how completely disappointed I was with this book. The nicest thing I can say is ""at least the cover looks decent."" The pictures are terrible. The recipes are VERY SIMPLE. Even if you don't know anything whatsoever about cooking, this book will not be helpful to you. I usually do not write bad reviews but I can honestly say that I hope this will someone not purchase this book. SAVE YOUR MONEY"
5,Dragonball Z: The Anime Adventure Game,"DragonBall Z is no doubt, the ""BEST JAPANIMATION EVER CREATED"""
1,Curb Records Should Be Curbed For This CD,"A CD with 8 tracks and a total time of 19 minutes is unsatsfactory, especially when one of those tracks is clearly an outtake, or should have been. On that particular track, the trumpet comes in about two measures too soon, realizes his mistake and stops playing until the rest of the band comes in. Oops!The CD is monaural, which would be okay, except that it was apparently recorded with only one microphone (perhaps around 1949-50?). The result is that, for most of the album, the piano and bass are barely audible.None of the players are identified, except that the cover picture is apparently of the Assunto family."
3,Lifetime 1259 Height-Adjustable Portable Basketball System,Assembly is relatively simple and the system seems to be stable and durable. Paint on the backboard began peeling off shortly after it was put up. Not an easy task to adjust height and could definately be more weather resistant.
3,"Nerd=Yes, Casual Fan like myself=NO","Unless you are a Fairly Oddparents nerd and long to have everything FOP-related (games, VHS, DVD, music, books, etc.), DON'T BUY THIS!Game is Boring and REALLY HARD in parts.STAY AWAY FROM THIS! Buy ""Breakin Da Rules"""
2,Poor customer service,"""I ordered the ""wipe your paws"" doormat. It was supposed to arrive by the 8th and it's now the 12th. I've asked the vendor twice now for a tracking number for the shipment and all I get in return is ""the item has shipped"". Very frustrating considering I placed the order on November 27th......15 days ago!!!"""
3,dissapointed,"I expected a hard cover and it was a paperback. I expected it to be new and LOOK new. It looked used. It was shipped out by a company called Peoples Books. It got lost in the mail and re-shipped...took almost 4 weeks. Since this is a gift I really wish it had looked like it could be ""a gift""."
2,Not Spider-Man's best,"Spider-Man has been in a lot of games in his career, from his first adventure on the Atari to the recent game for the Playstation. Between the two, this Genesis game came out and it didn't exactly set the gaming world on fire. What you're looking at here is a very average game that doesn't do our friend Spidey justice. The gameplay is just too bland and repetitive for it to be fun. While it does have plenty of his best villians, it doesn't make it any more enjoyable. Graphics are good, sound is okay, but there are better games out there. Sadly, the Playstation Spider-Man game has been the only game to truly capture what Spidey's all about. If you have a Playstation, pick that one up. But for you Genesis owners, you're out of luck."
1,Be wary,"My son recently received this toy for his birthday and I am sorely disappointed.For a couple of months both my children could not go to the store without hitting the button and making Spiderman sing.Once we opened the package I was surprised to see a note about how the arms should be placed to avoid damage, seems a bit much to ask for a child's toy as children likely are not going to stop mid play to correct arm placement.My real gripe is that now, less than 24 hours with the product it is unbearable to use. Once you press the buttons on his feet the song is accompanied by a very loud clicking that seems to some from the middle section of the toy. The clicking easily drowns out the singing and more than anything, it is a shame to have children disappointed so quickly because of poor construction.In summary, it was cute and great when movement was fixed on a store shelf, but out of the box is a whole other issue."
4,Itsy-Bitsy Spider Man,"I bought the Itsy-Bitsy Spider Man for my 2 year old nephew who was just learning to sing ""The Itsy Bitsy Spider."" He absolutely loved this toy- he figured out how to press the buttons and laughed at the toy's movement of his hands. My nephew has triplet sisters who are 1 years old, and they equally loved the toy- in fact they have conquered possession of it. There are two songs that it plays- and it will only play one peice of the song at a time. To hear an entire song (Spiderman and Friends, or Itsy Bitsy Spider) the button must be pushed 4-5 times. This feature is positive because you don't have to endure a lengthy song. The singing is in a child's voice which is appealing to my nephew and neices, but it can be a little loud."
3,"really bad graphics, it;s fun but the graphics really..","If you are a gamer who cares more for game play than for graphics you will like this one. However, if you want a balance don;t get this. Sometimes it's hard to even see where the doors are in this game. The characters look all choppy and the game battle system was just too simple. It wasn't like the one for the XBOX."
4,From a Teachers Perspective`,"We viewed The Trojan Horse at our 6th grade school inconjunction with our study on ancient Greece. The kids and teachersalike loved it. The students even asked to see it twice in one day! Itis a truely wonderful movie that keeps everyone interested and entertained while giving a basic history lesson. (Though not totally accurate, differences are easily explained.) END"
1,what a crock,"Whether you like the Catholic Church or not, there never was a Pope Joan. If you want historical fiction get an Oliver Stone movie and be done with it. If you want anti-Catholicism get the writings of Martin Luther, but at least be intellectually honest."
4,In Others' words,"Excellent album. I previously had 3 Dwight Yoakam favorites, Hillbilly, Cadillacs and Buenas Noches. Now I have 4, In Others' Words. Also an excellent quality used disc, thanks Bull Moose."
4,Dwight Rocks!,"Dwight Yoakam is my favorite new wave country-western stars. His versatility as an entertainer was proven in Sling Blade. He does wear that hat for a reason! I purchased another album ""under the covers"" where Mr. Yoakam played other artists hits and his twang is pure country and adds to the fun of doing covers. This has a great collection of songs and I would have given it five stars except for the addition of ""T for Texas"" which was already released on ""under the covers"". I do not know why this was included except for filler. This man can do no wrong because he sings from the heart and his stories sometimes reflect me in them.I do not own every Dwight Yoakam album , but I am working on it.Buy this if you are a fan or are looking for something different. In either case you will be satisfied."
2,My Book Group Recently Read This,"I'm fascinated reading the other reviews printed here, for people seem to either really enjoy or really dislike this book. My Book Group of 7 women did not care for this book - the general consensus being, among other things, the lack of character development among key, critical characters, the heavy-handed foreshadowing, the excruciatingly slow pace, and the unconvincing female voice delivered through Roxanna's character. We did wonder if the group did not appreciate the story because none of us were raised in the South... I've noticed that many of the favourable reviews are from people who can recall their own experiences in a Southern town. Nonetheless, we felt the book was flawed in numerous ways and would have had difficulty finishing it had we not felt compelled to for book discussion purposes."
4,Post WW2 Russian armour,"An all incompassing look at the progress of Russian tanks and other armoured vehicles. It also looks at unarmoured but specialised vehicles such as missile launchers, engineer's vehicles, tracked cargo carriers and tractors. It has a section of schematics and cutaway drawings to give a look inside some very interesting vehicles. The only letdown is the complete lack of colour, except for the (unusually) rather uninspiring painting by David Pentland on the dust cover. Do NOT let this put you off this book. I am sure that anyone with the vaguest interest in the subject will feel that this is a book that they cannot do without. Indulge yourself. Highly recommended."
3,dc comics?,"i can't believe that no one picked up that in the description they say dc comics instead of marvel .i live in worcester MA, and theres a notorious comic book store here,if those geeks heard that mistake whoever wrote that mistake would get blasted .whoever wrote that would have to live in exile for the rest of there life,what a dope!"
2,Blegh!! Written for 12-year olds,"Utter crap. Reads like the outline to a bad fan-fiction movie, complete with a girl-crush from the plucky young heroine on a young Tom Zarek.For anyone that seriously enjoys the show, you need to skip this ""book"" and pretend it doesn't exist. Reading it will be painful and annoying - thankfully it is a very quick read so the torture doesn't drag on too long.On a more serious note, it is written for preteens with a crude, simplistic plot and nearly non-existent character development. There are gaping plot holes and serious deviations from established canon that are distracting. While it claims to ""based upon"" the re-imagined series, the word ""loosely"" should be included in that statement."
2,dun know,"Not much really to say, but it is what you probably expect from a ..........not very liked rapper."
3,Great at first- not so great with age!,"I purchased my second Fresh Flow Pet fountain (the deluxe model) over three months ago. It is my second in 2 years. While it did pique the interest of my overweight, UTI prone cat- and the other two cats (in fact they all love it) each one has failed in the basic operation despite numerous cleanings and proper filter replacement. Most times it does not flow until I fiddle around with the lever and get it to make that humming noise, at which point it will emit a small trickle. I love the fact the cats seem to love it, but am not pleased that I will be looking at replacing this model in the near future. I am seriously considering the Drinkwell alternative.I do like this model for the water capacity, but do find it awkward to transport to and from the sink (without a spill or two).Quality Control seems to lack in the product. I probably will not buy again unless they make improvements."
2,"NOT ""Ultra Quiet""","I see other reviews to the contrary, but the one we got was FAR from silent. The other attributes of this pet drinking fountain appear to be accurate. The sound level, however, is more like a coffee grinder than a 'silent' fountain. We checked all the applicable trouble-shooting tips, such as making sure the pump was properly secured to the bottom on its suction cups, and also making sure there was sufficient water in the system for the pump to function properly. Still, quite loud. The cat reacted to it like it was a killer robot from space. Returned it and got the Drinkwell, which also has some pump noise, but it is well masked by the sound of the splashing water, which seems to appeal to the kitty, rather than repelling her."
5,Great Game,"This is a great little board game. We had a fun time playing this and replayed it several times. The rules are easy and it plays in about an hour or so. Its a nice break from Agricola, the strategy is simple. This is now one of my favorite board games."
2,Hardy Boys for grown-ups?,"There's a nifty premise here -- that John James Audubon reached the Pacific Coast and left behind four previously undiscovered paintings (in real life, he never made it that far west). Unfortunately, this becomes incidental to an at-best conventional murder mystery plot. The writing is sub-par, character descriptions are cursory, and details are bobbled. The dialogue reminded me at times of reading Hardy Boys books when I was a kid. It's too bad, because I love a birdwatching hero! I'll try his others and see."
4,Four 'blades up' for this book,"Richard Langston is an acknowledged expert in this field and a well known avid collector of automatic knives. He does not disappoint in the ""Collector's Guide to Switchblade Knives"" . While the book is a little heavily oriented to towards the early twentieth century companies of Pressbutton, Schrade Walden, and their derivatives, this is in keeping with the spirit of the hobby as these are generally the most sought after knives. His insights on the histories of these companies is invaluable from the standpoint of determining age of these products. On the down side, I would have liked to have seen a little more historical and dating information about other companies products and imported knives, but you can only get so much in one book."
2,great for american switchblades only,"This book has great information on American switchblade history. There is very little information on italian switchblades. All pictures are black and white. If your into American switchblades, this is your book. If your looking for information on Italian switchblades, pass on this book."
1,9V vibe,"It's not easy to find a vibe that uses 9V battery. I was very dissapointed when the battery wuoldn't even click in. It is so cheaply made it's not funny.Don't take a chance on this brand name. It's money down the drain. Some have mentioned returning it, no returns on this type of product."
4,Exactly what I expected...,"Both films were silly, and I expected nothing more and nothing less. We, of the Drive-In crowd, are still alive and don't forget. The fun stuff is looking at Corman as a ""visionary"". Women's lib actually happened (sorta), and ""Teenage Caveman"" may be an idea behind ""Planet of the Apes"". I was amused and entertained. I expected nothing more than that, and I enjoyed this DVD very much."
1,PlanPlus - No Plan...No Clue,"I am a Franklin Planner from way back but unfortunately, they haven't a clue about how to produce functional software. Their PlanPlus is a buggy kludge of software and shouldn't be marketed until they fix it. I have removed it and I am currently looking for another product that can do the same job without crashing Outlook or my OS."
5,The Lion king Rocks!!!!!!!!!!!,My Cousins have this game and wanted me to check it out. Right when I started to play I did't want to leave my chair! Great charectars and effects! This is my favorite game in the world!!
5,One of- if not THE- best Celtic music albums to be had!,"I just recently found a webpage that discusses what ""Donegal style"" fiddling is all about, and am very happy to know that two of my favorite artists- Altan and Natalie MacMaster, either play that style of fiddle, or a style very similar to it (i.e., Natalie's Cape Breton style)! This is my favorite of all of Altan's fine albums, though I'm just now ordering their latest. With two or three of my favorite ""high speed"" fiddle tune favorites, and the beautiful, soulful voice of lead singer Mairidh (sp?) singing songs that I love without understanding the Gaelic words, I find myself playing this one over and over again. Buy the album- it's worth at least ten times its price!"
1,Rot,"This is an excellent example of a critic making a name for himself by ""reading into"" & interpreting (misinterpreting) other hugely respected authors according to one's own projected ideology. Since not one of the three famous & brilliant mythologists studied would agree with Ellwood's assessment of him, why should we assume his oh-so-sensitive political perspective & believe he & his particular judgmental frameworks have more insight into the workings of their minds than they do themselves? We shouldn't. Each of them would be aghast at this so much smaller intellect misreading him for its own ends. I implore you: If you wish to understand Jung, Eliade, or Campbell, read Jung, Eliade, or Campbell themselves. The three together complement each other nicely. If you must read Ellwood, be fair & read some of the great ones he ""demythifies"" for us *before* you venture into his abuse of them."
2,Not the best,I would not recommend this product for HDTV but works fine for gaming and Blu-Ray. You get what you pay for.
2,"Pointless, and really not much fun.","I read several reviews of this game that said it sucked, but I also read a couple that said ""Oh, those guys just don't -get- it. This game rocks.""So I read the guide, I played through the tutorial and started to play. After playing for a couple of hours, all I can say is I must not get it because this game sucks. There seems to be a countdown timer that's always running, although you don't get to see it until the clock has less than 15 seconds left. Although the tutorial never makes mention of it, you seem to have a limit to how many times you can explode yourself to take your enemies out. I presume that ""extend"" adds both time and another chance to explode yourself, but nothing ever actually describes what extend means.In the end, I don't really care to find out the subtle nuances because the game just isn't worth playing."
3,"Expensive, not durable, but oh-so-cute.","They're the cutest stylus pens of all. The pen is about 4"" long, made of pretty cheap plastic. At least the tip is soft and smooth. I'm very gentle with all my toys but the cap still broke in 5 days. Since it's so cute, I'm willing to overlook some flaws."
3,A pretty good documentary......,"The Omen films have always been some of my favorite scary movies ever. This documentary goes into the movies themselves & the strange stories that happened during the filming of the movies. People who were making these films started to believe that they were cursed. While some just thought it was a hoax. Either way, it's interesting to hear how the films were made, what impact they had on the film industry, and how well they did at the box office. If you are a fan of the films at all, I recommend this DVD. It's not as good as the Alien Legacy disc, but it's still very interesting and is worth the cash."
4,A worthy choice for SP Collectors.,"The only problem with this disk is when you skip you skip an entire title, not just a scene. And even then you still have to watch Matt & Trey's intro, which to say the least gets old after the first few times. The episodes are great, classic, and a must buy for those who like holidays. Valentines day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas are all included in this politically inncorrect satire. Just buy the ******* DVD!"
5,Exceeds expectations!,"I purchased two boxes of the Festival Medley this summer, cooked one for Thanksgiving with no additions to the mix. It was delicious! Cooked the second box yesterday, and added lean pork tenderloin that I'd cooked separately. OMG! I'm buying more!"
3,"Like father, like son... Hitman 1, Hitman 2...","Not much difference in this game from the original. Had some difficulty with the controls, especially switching weapons... The original was a nightmare... Hitman 47 and IGI were both nightmares! I kept playing them until I couldn't stand it anymore... The controls were terrible and I still see some problems with it in this game... The game is interesting and it's definitely fun to blow somebody away, but the controls are still a bit awkward... I'm on the fence with this one folks...You might find it a lot of fun and manage to work the controls better than me. EADOS needs to do some work on this game before it's really top notch... It has the makings of an excellent game with some deficiencies...primarily contols... The demo didn't allow me to save either, n'or did the first Hitman game. Like IGI, EADOS was supposed to have addressed that issue in the new game..."
4,Splinter Cell + NOLF 2 = Hitman 2,GREAT GAME!Overall score:8Graphics score: 9Audio score: 8Storyline score: 10Game play score: 8.5Replayvalue score: 7.0GET IT!!!!!(powerful computer recommended)
1,A very bad game,"First od all, this game is not exciting, it is dull, not interesting, it crashes a lot, loading and saving are not easy, the missions and not well prepared, contain lots of mistakes, it is not amusing to spend 4 or more levels chasing in the desert.Action games are not for Eidos, I'd prefer others like Medal of honor, or return to castle wolfenstein and others..."
5,Great ethnic Music,"CapernaumNot the sense of history that the Battlefield Field band has,butalas a sound that document the beauty of Scotish cultures. ejt"
4,LOVE this Broad!,"Elaine Stritch is the last of the legends.Not many out there who can still mesmerize and audience for 2 1/2 hours but Elaine Strich is from the old school and even more importantly, she tells the truth! About her alcholism, battle back, career problems, etc.I also love to see shows recorded live. Even if it was not the most interesting filming of it, it is still so important that it is recorded and there is nothing else like it!"
1,Make it stop!!!,"This game is so bad it makes Shaquille's rap career look like it was that of Tupac's by comparison. I remember when Big Frank's dad bought this for him for his birthday, it was one of his ""big"" presents, needless to say, Big Frank was excited at first glance (hey, back in segas hay-day this game had a LOT of hype) well, we pop that cartridge in and played for 1 hour and to put it lightly, it was Big Franks birthday, and he'll cry if he wants too (he actually cried for 6 hours because the game was so bad and his birthday was ruined) his dad had been drinking whiskey throughout the night and when Big Frank went crying to his dad about how bad the game was, he was beaten badly with one of those spaulding air pumps that you use for your sporting ball needs, well, I couldn't stand to watch the drunken beating, so I fleed the scene shortly after, and needless to say that was the last time I saw Big Frank's dad, moral of the story, don't play this game."
3,Smell is strong...pain relief?,not so much.The container is very difficult to open; I would recommend those with pain/arthritis of the hand to steer clear.I've some knee pain due to over-training. I wish you well.
3,Smells Awful,It works great... smells awful. Wore it to the office and everyone was like -- who stinks?? lol It's a trade-off. Feel better or stink!
1,tiger balm,"I am glad I also bought the tiger balm cream, because next to the cream based balm, the tiger balm salve as exemplified by this product is essentially worthless"
2,Beware of Warning on this Product,"I must say that I am very pleased with how fast the seller sent this product. However, the wanring on the back of the package caused me to become alarmed. It read: ""WARNING: This product contains chemicals known to the state of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm."" After reading this, I definitely can't use this product."
1,junk history,"As a neighbor to Pennsylvania, I enjoy exploring the byways and historical sites within this amazing state, so purchased this book with that in mind. What I found, to the contrary, was a lot of ""ghost stories,"" and silly information that was of little interest or consequence. Worse yet, the ""information""--and I'm being very generous with this term--is not categorized by region, which puts the reader at a great disadvantage when one considers the size of this state. Equally poor is that maps are not included. Most of this book concerns itself with sites in and around the Philadelphia area.Pass on this one, and spend the time on the Internet looking up sites in this fabulous state."
2,"Entertaining, but unbalanced","This is a well written and interesting book, but severely ignores the western part of the state. It seemed as though every page was Bucks, Chester, or Delaware counties and Philadelphia. With very few stories west of Harrisburg/State College, and ONLY ONE story highlighting Pittsburgh, this book does not deserve the title Weird Pennsylvania... the publisher should call it what it is, Weird Philadelphia and its Countryside.Interesting? Yes, but still a huge disappointment."
5,Sooooo fun!,"I do not own this book as of yet, but my sister does. When I spend time at her house I love reading that book to my 14 month old daughter and my nephews. I have so much fun trying to do all of the character voices. I enjoy Bob and Larry as much as any child would. I remember the first Veggie Tales movie that I had ever seen, ""Where is God When I am S-Scared? - A Lesson in Handling Fear."" I still remember most of the songs. I would recommend this book, as well as anything else from Veggie Tales, to any parent looking for a fun way to teach a child life lessons and, most importantly, about God!"
5,Wonderful book for all ages,"I started to read this to my son when he was 5 months old. He is almost 2 years and still loves it! We do different accents for the different characters. He especially loves the outrageous french accent for the french peas. We are actually having a difficult time getting him to say ""tomato"" and ""cucumber"" - he calls them ""Bob"" and ""Larry""!"
2,"Poor screen, no-confidence quality","1. The 5"" screen is really small, because it's the conventional 4:3 aspect ratio, while most DVDs are widescreen, so you really lose a lot of details. The Panasonic LS5 also has a 5"" screen but is widescreen, so it actually gives you more viewing real estate than this one.2. Questionable quality and durability. Occasionally my unit would give out an unnerving whine as it spins the disc. Very annoying. The screen hinge seems quite flimsy."
3,"OK for DVD, but not for DVD-R",This unit did everything we wanted except play the DVD-R disks I made with my Panasonic DMR-E80H. Had to take it back.
4,From Back Cover,"Once the glamorous mistress to a high-powered mob boss, Natalie Pascal was now a kept woman of a very different sort.Her new keeper: U.S. Marshal Zack Ryder, the handsome man assigned to give her a new identity and a chance to cleanse her torrid past. Soon, only her guardian's presence could comfort her, only his touch could chase away her nightmares.Zack always played by the rules and that meant never getting involved with a witness. If Natalie's cover was compromised, she'd be given a new life - one he'd know nothing about. But trying to deny his desire for the vulnerable beauty was compromising his very ability to see danger approaching.By succumbing to Natalie's siren song, Zack could destroy his career and maybe his own safety. Now, who was keeping whom?"
2,Too easy,"My 10 year old finished this game in under six hours (including many of the bonus levels). That's 6 hours.Visually OK, the graphics are nothing special and glitchy in one or two places.Thst said, the kids (5+10) certainly enjoyed it but I'd suggest anyone with children older than 8 get something else. Children love to finish games off but I don't think it indicates good value for money."
3,Cute but squeaky.,"I love the look of these shoes but we didn't use them as much as I thought we would because the material of the shoe squeaks as my son walks around, which we both find to be ""less than desirable""."
3,mirror could be better,veru cute and easy to assemble. The only problem is the mirror is very cheap and you can hardely see anything. My daughter doenot enjoy it because of this reason. I am looking to replace the mirror with something a little more realistic.
5,Wonderful,I gave thsi gift to my 2.6 year old niece and she simply loves it. She loves having her own drawer to put away her beauty stuff and get r eady to go out. She also makes my brother and sister in law sit on her stool so that she can comb their hair. So cute.
5,A must for any Two Year old,"This is SOOOOOOOOOOO cute I loved it when my grandaughters play ""pretend "" with it A GREAT BUY !!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,She LOVES HER VANITY,"I gave this to my 2 yr. old granddaughter for Christmas, and she LOVES IT!!! It is very well made, sturdy, not like a lot of the cheap plastic ones in the stores!!!"
3,Golden Voice of pop spirituality,"This collection of Pat's spiritual songs was purchased for one of the hymns on the CD. His voice is often golden and warm, at rare times strained and nervous.The hymn that I purchased the CD for was all too brief and failed to capture the urgency of the composer's plea."
2,i tried it,"it took me a while to get through this book. i found the main character annoying and was tired of her whining. the love interest/detective i found rather boring and wishy washy. since i didn't like the main character i found it difficult to care what was going on. in fact, the only reason i bothered to complete the book was the hope that the main character would change her attitude; sadly, it never happened. the only thing i did like about the book was the historical details about the antiques."
3,Not quite right for my machine,"The extra cardboard is in the way. However, I just trimmed down the cardboard by about a quarter of an inch and the bags are still fine."
2,the bags are not made by dirt devil,The bags come in a plain plastic bag and they do not look like product in the photo. It does not have any manufacturer info (Royal is shown in the photo) either on the bags or on the plastic bag packaging. The actual paper bag is smaller than an original Dirt Devil F. So much for getting a good deal on a Dirt Devil bags...
3,Weak finish to the Gateway Saga,"Baeing a avid Fred Pohl reader and being throughly entertained by the earlier Gateway novels I expected this to be a strong finish to the series. Instead what we have is a weak rambling story that bears little or no resemblence to the source. It left me wondering ""Mr. Pohl what happened?"
1,Fellowes Small Monitor Riser - What a disappointment!,"This item is a very poorly made and designed item. It is made of cheap plastic and feels like cheap plastic. The rubber ""feet"" fell off as soon as I opened the box. They would not stay on; it appeared as if the glue that was used dried up from excessive heat. The feet extend to make it taller, but they are very flimsey. I would NOT trust my expensive monitor to sit on top of this riser. Like the other reviewer said, it is ""tacky"". I will add cheap, poorly designed, flimsey, way overpriced. It looks good in the picture, but that's the only positive thing I can say about it."
4,good stable platform,"I needed a riser not for a computer monitor, but to allow the placement of a cable box under a television in my children's toy room. Most risers are too small, or could not carry the weight of a television. This model fit perfectly, and is rated well above the weight of a normal 20 inch TV. The slide out drawer, even gives me a place to keep the remote. This was well worth the price."
4,rating,good dvd. great condition. original packaging. still in wrapper.we enjoy WWII movies and learning more and more about who was involved and what happened.It's interesting to put added pieces of the puzzle together.thank you
4,Very True To the Historical Record,"TV movies generally lack atmosphere, and this one is no different. But it is very authentic in itsdepiction of the characters and events. The odd thing about it is that its principals represent astrange gathering of movies and TV shows: Martin Bormann is the intrepid detective from The Day of theJackal, Goebbels is from The Boys in the Band, Albert Speer (the closest thing the show has to aprotagonist) was Jean Valjean in a TV Les Mis, Eva Braun comes from Rich Man, Poor Man, and there iseven a very young version of the future Inspector Foyle (Michael Kitchen). The main reason to watchis Anthony Hopkins, who gives a stunning performance as Hitler, varying from awkward chumminess toshrieking paranoia and, finally, numb acceptance of the most deserved doom in history. Viewerswho are unfamiliar with these events can add a star to my rating, for the narrative is sure and true."
4,A great film with great performances.,This is one the best films that have ever been made. Anthony Hopkins' portrayal of Hitler was effective and convincing. The film had a lot of suspense and action. It kept me entertained throughout the whole film. It was not a weak or depressing movie at all. I really enjoyed watching this movie. I think that it's worth watching.
5,good,This book is filled with information and inspiration. Definitely a keeper that will get much use. What more can I say? Good reference to have on hand.
1,OEM Sony Ericsson T610/T616 wall charger.,This charger did not charge my phone as I hoped it would. I hope I am able to get another charger that will work.
3,SEE My other review on 4870L,SEE MY OTHER REVIEW ON strong arm lift supports 4870L by myself...posted not that long ago. Same review as this one
5,Get away from the poetry they fed you in college,"McClure's poetry does need to be read aloud (get Love Lion, his album, for a demonstration) but this is good a transcript to work from as any; a perfect lead in to his books, poems of which are from nine of."
3,Half worth it,"I agree with the other reviewers' statement that the first half of this CD is the best. ""Bonnie Ship the Diamond"" is rocking. ""Gillies"" is hard to forget. ""Tall Ships"" talks about a past the seafaring Irish long to have back. Wolfstone is electric on the first half and lets you down for the second. Still worth it for the songs noted."
2,Not very sturdy,I ordered this for my daughter to use at college for her bunk bed. It broke beyond repair within about two weeks of use. It would probably be okay if used on a very occasional basis by a small child.
4,Great eco bags,"I've used these bags for years, with great results. Rarely have the drawstrings been a problem -- they're just very convenient. I hope Seventh Generation starts producing them again."
2,Comprehensive but dated cruising guide,"An impressive tome at 600 pages, though at 6+ years since publishing, it is dated for a cruising guide. The Amazon.com headline reviews are misleading with statements of ""brand new"" and ""latest"". I'll keep it (a gift) as an armchair planning guide, but will seek more current information before cruising the Keys. The content is comprehensive, but the format is not the best for use on-board . The newsprint quality paper is easily torn and not water resistant. Better cruising guides are of 8 1/2""x11"" coated stock, and spiral bound for easier insertion of updates."
4,Incredible Value,It's a vacuum bag so there isn't anything special to review. I just want to comment on how great the price is for a 10-pack. One problem I had was using the same bag for too long before replacing it thus reducing my vacuum's efficiency. But I didn't want to spend a lot of money on expensive 3-packs. But now that I have ten bags (at less than $1 a piece) I will able to replace the bags more often but still spend less money than buying the 3-packs at the store.
1,Dont waste your money!!!,"These bags did not work properly as I started vacuuming dust started coming out of the bag. I did install the bag correctly I've done it many times. My livingroom look like the dust bowl. It wasnt just one bag it was multiple. I end up throwing them out, it wasn't worth me paying to ship them back. Just called it a lost and bought the better bags from my local store."
5,Tim Mcgraw-All I Want,"I have been listening to Country Music ever since I was a little boy and let me tell you,it don't get no better than Tim Mcgraw!! If you liked/ loved his first Cd,well it only gets better and better after listening to that one! I have all of Tim's CD's and you won't find an artist who is more true to what he writes and how he gets it across to his fans all over the world.I am a huge music lover of all types.I am extremely picky about connecting with that certain artist or song.The song first of all has to really touch me inside,kinda like the first time you had butterflies in your stomach or goose bumps on your arm.That is eactly the kind of artist Tim Mcgraw is and always has been.When he writes a song,well you can believe he will tell it from his heart and soul."
5,pretty good for the price,"A little noisy, but it sure is fun. I like the different vibrations and levels, we enjoyed it. Not bad for the price."
2,Deplorable amount of senseless bugs.,At first the books shows promise. But BUYER beware. The source code for this books is amateurish. The books is usable for merely entertainment but don't find yourself paying full price for this mess. There are many other books on ai and game programming which are 100 times better than this. MORE BUGS THAN A RAIN FOREST. :(
1,Not relevant to me,I didn't appreciate this book when I read it because it was all I could find at the time regarding diamonds and I wanted more. It is about buying and selling diamonds on a non-professional basis. Beginners only.
1,ABSOLUTE LOWGRADE RUBBISH,"I've read it and agree with first reviewer. Save your money and time, it's pure, unadulterated cr*p, start to finish and factually incorrect on many points. The positive reviews shown are actually written in the uninformed style of the books author...strange coincidence."
2,Stuffed pumpkins,"The Peter Pumpkin Eater figure of the Twisted Fairy Tales line... the least detailed of the set and the least inspired of an otherwise fantastic set of figures. It just doesn't fit in with the deatil of the other figures and seems more of a late addition afterthought to the series. It's probably the easiest one to find as the female figures are snatched up quickly and fetch a heftier price on the market. IMO, the worst of the batch. It should have been better when compared to the other figures of the series."
1,Re-recordings of the hits...BEWARE,"This is a typical schlock Curb Records collection that trys to pass off re-recordings as the ""best of"". As such, this collection should be skipped by all but completists.Most people will be looking at this collection for one song: ""Into the Night"". And the ORIGINAL version of that song is available on the CD ""Never Run, Never Hide.""Benny Mardones is a talented fellow, and there's more to him than the one hit. But you should get the originals, not these lame remakes."
3,Well...,"Music is so subjective. My two cents is that as much as I'd love to be into a singer with the pseudonym Cat Power, try as I might, I couldn't get into this album at all. I'm into most of Amazon's ""People who bought this also bought..."" artists, so I thought I'd give Cat Power a try.I experienced the first two songs as reflective, moody, fragile--a good beginning to an album. To my dismay, I realized that the melancholy tone of the album perpetuated itself almost brutally. I found subsequent songs to be slow and aimless. I couldn't get a grasp on the mood the album was attempting to create (I spend enough time staving off ""no-light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel"" depression to want to embrace an album that seems to build it almost deliberately). But then, I've only ever been able to get through the first half of the album. An acquired taste."
4,Stripped down and intimate,"This is a beautiful album, which shows that when it comes to music, sometimes less is more. Most of the songs are built around simple acoustic guitar strumming, rudimentary piano chords, and Chan Marshall's raw, intimate vocals. The result is emotional, evocative, and personal. Some standout tracks include ""Good Woman"" (which features intriguing uncredited backing vocals by Eddie Vedder), ""Werewolf"", a haunting tune enhanced by a well-placed cello, and the mournful ""Names"", which tells the stories of a handful of abused or neglected children Chan has known in her life."
1,are you serious?,"nothing special here. another boring artist that has fans that like music because of the image (that image being the one that supposedly doesn't have an image). People that will enjoy this most likely enjoy getting the same bobby dyed-black haircut that all there friends have, even though its completely original, right? Also, the electronics used in the background of this album are completely unoriginal and mundane. This album can be summed up in two words: BOR ING"
4,A pleasant surprise...,Cat Power is a pleasant surprise in my life - musically speaking... I was staying the weekend at an SO of mine and he had this cd of hers... I fell in love with her music style immediately... If you are a downtempo/ethereal dj - you need this cd of hers - as well as check out the rest of her music as I am going to do... I enjoyed at different levels every track on this cd... So pick it up - you won't regret it... DJ Dakini-NYC
3,"Ok, but not great","I have seen her live and love some of her songs, but feel this album is not consistently good."
1,Too confusing,"The book is more focused on business rules engine setup from a physical table design perspective. It fails to clearly elaborate on the modeling of the declarative structure of business rules as ERD and associated table structure. The approach outlined and the examples do not reflect the all categories of business rules. Also it is not clear from the sample application that is provided for download how different category of rules are designed and assembled for transactional working. In fact the sample rules implementation in the book is more associated with (physical) application screen design rather than organizational process logic; also, such implementation could have been more easily done through triggers in an enterprise class DBMS like Oracle than desktop DBMS like Access which lacks such capability."
1,Where is the rest of it?!,I ordered two of the pecan gatherers because I had been looking for this exact kind that was shown in the photo. When they arrived they didn't have the handles that are pictured. I have taken them to several hardware stores to try to purchase a handle and have not had any success. I thought maybe it was easy to get a wood handle and screw it on but apparently these have a medal screw instead of a wooden screw and I can't find anything that works. Why would you put the handle in the picture if there wasn't one included. You can bet I'm sending these back to you!
2,Very cheap construction,"It always seems like it is right on the verge of falling apart. You have to constantly tighten the stick to it, and the base of it keeps losing pecans after they are picked up."
4,Excellent C++/Motif Library,"Douglas Young created an excellent ""light"" C++ wrapper approach toward the very complicated Motif GUI library. This 1995 Second Edition of the work includes a very nice ""template"" approach toward storing lists of Widgets.This is the approach supported by the X-Designer GUI designer made by IST, so having the reference work is highly useful.If you can't find this edition, the 1992 First Edition is also quite useful. Note the source files are still available at export.lcs.mit.edu/contrib/books"
2,Only plus is that it's the only book out there,"Compared to the Roach guidebook for the Colorado 14ers, this book is horrible. There are no topo maps, no color, hardly any elevations for trailheads, camping spots, saddles, etc. It's a very disappointing guidebook that leaves out so much of the information that you look for in a guidebook. The authors did extensive research on the historical routes and perhaps the book is more useful as a history book than a climbers' guide. But it's the only book I found for the California 14ers and so I bought it. It's primary use is getting you to the proper trailhead for the climbs and even there it wasn't ideal. When my buddy, currently speed-record holder for the CA 14ers saw I had the book, the first thing he told me was a better way to approach one of the trailheads."
1,Don't buy from Classic Game Source Inc.,"1.) Bought these cables from Classic Game Source Inc.2.) Standard stereo RCA cables for a Genesis 3.3.) Yellow & Red worked, but not White.4.) Emailed them. They told me they went out tested.5.) Returned item and asked for replacement.6.) No replacement. Just a refund.7.) Petty."
5,Wonderful book for writers as well as teachers!,"This book is my favorite poetry handbook--and I have several--because it covers so many forms in such an clear, undry (i.e. entertaining) way. It's fun to read. I've taught poetry writing at about 40 elementary schools through the Writers in the Schools programs and children's literature at the University of Iowa. The Handbook gives a passel of forms that can be used with kids of all ages. In the children's lit class, the book was a means of showing the wide variety of forms. The undergrad students in that class, most of whom weren't that familiar with poetry, were dazzled by all the possibilities that the book opened up. As a writer, I enjoy reading about the different forms and examples. You can try writing in one of the forms, or try making up a new form based on forms in the book. Either way, you learn, you enjoy, you think, and you write, thanks to the Handbook."
5,This is arguably the best textbook for learning Korean,"This comprehensive textbook intended for beginning or intermediate students of Korean is presented in a logical format divided into twenty-six lessons. Each lesson begins with a short Korean dialogue (which one may translate) and follows with step-by-step linguistic/grammar rules replete with examples. The authors--college proffesors themselves--articulate themselves quite nicely, so that one may work alone with this book and still learn the language. A detailed pronounciation guide is included, and 140 Chinese characters (used in addition to the Korean alphabet) are also introduced. I can guarantee that any serious student using this comprehensive textbook will be reading, writing, and speaking adequate Korean in less than six months."
3,Not exactly for Self Study,"I got this book to teach myself Korean. I was somewhat disappointed. I expected to find answers to the sample problems at the end. I found none. I wanted some explanation of why some things were this way or that. I found a straight assertion that things were just like that, but sometimes different...the end. Very frustrating. You can generally make out the answer to the exercises because it is very good about making sure all the words used are ones you already know from the chapters, but you can't be 100% positive you got it right.This looks like a book that would be good in a Korean class, where you can get explanations of things in more depth, but for self-study, I'd avoid."
5,Another great edition,"Improvement over an already superb outing last year...the Association is better than old Frnachise mode...24/7 is even better (improved skill enhancement, online play), and this is the most addictive feature of any sports game...Fantasy Line-Ups for quick games...in all, the best NBA game on the market...and it's less than $20"
3,Good but I've seen better,"This game is good and all, if it didn't have 24/7 mode. And music and more it wouldn't be as good. I'm sorry the game has alot but the game play, is just bad. And they have too many extra stupid teams. That did not have to be added. The game isn't the wrost game out but there is better, like NBA 2005 that is more NBA like."
4,Sega Genisis 2,I received a sega genisis 8 years ago and the graphics are not great but you have alot of fun on the game. I just wish they still made games for it especially car games when I received sega genisis I thought it was going to be a cheap system that would break in three days but it has lasted a long time but I just hoped they would continue to make games for sega genisis.Thanks
4,A MI ME GUSTO!,ESTE LIBRO TE HACE SENTIR COMO SI ESTUVIERAS AHI VIVIENDO LAS SITUACIONES CON EL PERSONAJE. LO UNICO MALO ES QUE ES MUY LENTO Y NO DESARROLLA. LAS HISTORIAS ERAN DIVERTIDAS Y MUY DETALLADAS. ES UN BUEN LIBRO PARA EL QUE LE GUSTAN LAS HISTORIAS RURALES Y CON MUCHOS PERSONAJES.
4,A Resurgence of Black Pride,"A Swan Song is an intense and passionate collection of poems that will inspire you to connect or re-connect to a Black social consciousness. This sister, Janette Owens, is about the business of the people; and she has the heart and soul of a poet. She will lead you to the water AND make you want to drink it.She writes with clarity and wisdom. If you are not intimidated by straight talk and ""in your face"" directness, then this is the book for you. If you want to raise your level of consciouness, A Swan Song is also the book for you. Support this sister and buy A Swan Song. It's deep."
4,Thank You,"I read your book on the plane last night and I thoroughly enjoyed the short stories and poems. I have to admit I am not much of a poetry guy, but I found yours to be entertaining and thought provoking. Growing up in a segregated world, it is great to read from those individuals with a different perspective than my own, be it race, sex or religion. Your writings also point out we all long for the same things--respect, love, friendship and connections to the world outside our own.Keep up the writing and let me know when you have that novel ready."
4,"Intriguing, Dynamic, and Soul-Stirring","A Swan Song is a quick read and well written. Owens's perception of contemporary relationships is right on the money. Great use of metaphors and imagery. Get used to seeing this author, she'll be around for awhile.I recommend buying this book."
1,You can't always trust the reviews,"I guess I was hoping for a book that contained more intuitive insight instead of the simple rehashing of religious doctrine. There is more to spirituality than Judeo-Christian myth. It seems that most ""Christians"" believe that the only way out of addiction is through religious dogma."
4,Very insightful.,"I found this book to be very insightful and informative. I had a bit of a problem with what I feel are extremely wordy paragraphs that take too long to get to the point. However, I found all of the answers I was searching for and then some."
5,Addiction & Grace,I ordered this book for my Graduate level Addictions Counseling class. I really felt that this book was a great resource for anyone that has a desire to help those struggling with addictions.
1,Not my cup of Tea,"This book is so depressing that I could not finish it. I rarely give up on a book, but this one was one that I had to stop reading. This is a book that was recommended by a book club I participate in, but I just cannot read another word of it. I made it to Chapter 9. I cannot relate to the characters nor the content. I read for pleasure but this book is not at all pleasurable."
2,"Lacks depth, but a good read","Marge Piercy's story is something like psychobabble science fiction without the explanation. Interestingly, she chooses a woman protagonist that isn't your typical hero. Instead, she is a poverty-stricken older woman, subject to the many dangers of the town she lives in. She has been committed to an institution by a pimp who wants her out of the way so he can take advantage of her niece. In the clinic, she sees a vision that appears very real to her, and claims to be from the future. It tells her that she must stay alive despite the circumstances, because she is important. Readers, along with the woman, Connie, are left wondering if her seemingly meaningless life is actually quite pertinent, or if she is simply too far gone to turn back. As my title says, it lacks depth. There is not much explanation as far as time-travel, theories, and whatnot. I'm not sure that's too important, but for me it left a lot of small holes in the story."
3,Women's Studies,"This is a required text book for a class I'm taking. This feels more like a book I would read for enjoyment than a ""required"" reading. I wasn't sure if I would like it, since it's not the normal plot that I'm interested in. Certain parts are a bit hard to relate to or imagine, but overall, interesting read."
2,"Good idea, but not compelling","I absolutely love Marge Piercy's writing - both her poetry and her novels, but this one didn't do it for me. I liked the feminist utopian vision. On the other hand, it was very easy to put this book down for a couple of days (or weeks). In addition, some of the future-lingo was irritating at times. For a great futuristic novel, I'd strongly recommend HE, SHE AND IT."
5,Must read,This story is engaging and inspiring. I feel like I am living in yet another world and am travelling into their world each time I sit down to read. Makes me want to envision my own desired world and fight for it...
1,This is the worst console port for PR ever!,"This game seems like it was thrown together to keep as much speed as possible. Back in the early 90s Genesis was the blistering fast system. As per the SEGA gargon. Truth is it was slghtly faster then SNES but couldn't handle the colors. So now was know why they left over half the colors of the orginial. Now we are stock with this thing. They kept most of the moves and all the colors, but doesn't have any intro or ending animation which means it looks half done. Before you defend this game, think of this. Super Street Fighter looked great, but they they just didn't take the time porting this game. And much like Mortal Kombat it looks drab, choppy, and well peiced together.On the other hand if you are a collector and you want a PR port check out 32X. It is one of the best ports out there. This is one of the most ported games of all time, and the Genesis is one of the ones to try to see how much they took out and how bad it was."
1,BIGGEST RIP OFF EVER,I paid 22 bucks for this cheap plastic piece of crap and it did not work.. I tried many batteries.. I feel RIPPED OFF.. like I just waisted 22 bucks on nothing. DO NOT GET IT.
2,great idea... but not for me,"I'm not sure given all the previous reviews why this little vibe doesn't do it for me. I love the idea. It's super cute, but just not for me. I found the power/intensity was not enough, actually a little frustrating. I have much better results with the 'bullet' type vibes."
4,Underexposed,"I could be wrong, but I don't think Baker & Myers are exactly household names when you think of country stars. But, this album has a pretty good sound and their ballads are enjoyable. I particularly liked ""Years From Here"", which 4PM (R&B Group) also has a version of. ""These Arms"" is also a good track, and another R&B Group, All-4-One, has a version of. If you enjoy the more classic ""twangy"" country sound, this album has its share of those tunes as well. In all, this was an enjoyable album that not too many people are familiar with, and I think this group was underexposed."
5,Beautiful and Haunting,"This is a beautifully written and deeply moving novel. In Mr. Stollman's hands, the remarkable and original characters living in the small Canadian city of Windsor, Ontario in the 1960's come vividly to life so that after the book's dramatic and lyrical ending, they remain and haunt the reader. I immediately re-read this richly-layered novel a second time and know I will come back to it again."
3,Brilliant beginning and promising future...,"There is something unusual in this book in terms of plot and the idiosyncrasies of the characters involved. The main character, Aryeh Alexander, is a small boy, intellectually gifted, who is surrounded by eccentric individuals: a neurotic mother, a loving father obsessed by Ancient Mesopotamia, a cantor and his sister both victims of the holocaust, and an ill-fated girl destined to die at an early age. Aryeh is involved in the misfortunes of all characters as an outsider, an a spectator. When reaching his coming of age, he secluded himself from the rest of the world in order to settle the confusion in his mind, life, and world. The author is master of a clear, beautiful, and poetic prose. The reader is left with the impression that this novel might represent the beginning of a future literary production with an overall more embracng depth and weight."
4,Fun!,"This DVD is not the hardest or easiest dance DVD that I've done. The intensity is about light-medium for me.I do like it for something different. I like the music and costumes as opposed to traditional american exercise garb. (I also like the African Healing Dance for the same reason)I notice that 5 women workout in a very small carpeted area, but I just use the whole room for a better workout.For $6.99, it is a good buy"
1,Little instruction,"I was very disappointed with this workout. It is not easy to follow, as many steps are not explained or showed at all, and sometimes when she talks about a move, the camera is on her face, rather than on her feet! This seemed unprofessional to me. I have done aerobics for years, and that helped me a little, but you have to follow this for long, in full speed, and learn it by copying, because there is little step-by-step instruction."
4,Cross-training for the Bellydancer!,I definitely enjoyed the workout! As someone interested in bollywood dance and coming from a bellydance background I have become more aware of my hand gestures and placements which are important in any dance. My rating of 4 stars reflects an enjoyable workout but some confusion with dancers not always in sync. I am keeping my video and would recommend it to someone interested in broadening their dance vocabulary and style.
4,great resource,World of darkness never disappoints for their resources. This book is great for last minute games with an equal blend of monsters for all types of gameplay.
3,The Answer to the Atheist's Handbook,"It amazes me how atheists can believe the way they do. It takes more faith to believe there is NO god than to believe there is. You really have to be blind to the wonders of life to believe it's all happenstance. The reading was difficult (for me) but it was an informative book. Still, the only way you can know God is real is if you believe by faith, then the knowing comes. Once you have that God encounter, you can't deny Him. Or His love."
2,somewhat disappointing,"Interesting thesis--warfare has been constant in humans for at least a million years. But the first half of the book presents no evidence, just invective against those who disagree. I stopped after reading half the book, maybe the evidence is all in the last half. If so, not a good writing strategy."
3,"Six of one, a half dozen of the other","The 45 sequences in Horses and Other Animals are included in the larger Animals in Motion by Muybridge. The difference being that in Animals, you get more sequences and usually better reproductions; in Horses and Other Animals you get fewer sequences, but larger images making the detail a little more visible - except in those cases where the reproductions are a little gray and washed out. You choose - more and better or fewer and more gray. You don't really need both books."
5,A great day for sure,"This is mature, straight ahead jazz. Sometimes it's reminiscent of Vince Guaraldi. Playful, just a hint of the sadly romantic. The real shining centerpiece for me is the Nat Adderly tune ""Sweet Emma."" I can't sit down for this one, and it sounds like the band couldn't either. The solo and ensemble playing are outstanding, and the rhythm transports me to New Orleans instantly. The tune builds from solo piano to ensemble playing, solos, and then a raucous verse of rather free playing -- and back to the melody -- and a smashing close. McClure is a skillful, tasteful player. Nothing slipshod here. This is a real find, and I would hate for any jazz lover to miss out on it."
2,Not what I expected,"While the item does work as indicated. It was a little to bulky for me and kept resetting while I was walking with it, very annoying. The only way I would recommend this to someone is if they were using it to keep score in the cart where it wouldnt get bumped. If you want to count your stokes when hitting I would recommend a manual stroke counter. They are smaller and more reliable."
1,NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,My God!!!! this game is the worst!!!. NBA live is way better. trust me. no wondor its 20.00
1,Not that tuff,My weim peeled off the fuzzy part of one ball. THe other he chomped down on and broke it in half. It is slightly stronger then some tennis balls but not strong enough.
5,Excellent remaster.,"I was looking for some recordings for my son who lives in Australia. He composes and plays music of a more country genre and wanted to start hearing and learning something about classical music. I chose this as one because it contained selections by both Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninoff that I had loved many years ago and hadn't listened to recently. I still loved them; hope my son will, too!"
2,Repetitive,"The repetitiveness of this novel is astounding. The story could easily have been told in half the length of this novel. All this book does is to introduce the characters and to bring them together. Nothing really happens. Is there a point to retelling similar experiences from five different perspectives? If you buy this book, prepare to do a lot of skimming. The only thing that made this novel bearable are the characters. They are strong, likable and well-drawn. In the end though, I didn't think I got my money's worth. In my opinion, setting the scene for a five book series shouldn't consume an entire book."
3,"some good, some bad","I've just finished reading this book, and I'll probably read the rest of the series. It's an engaging book, very easy to read, and enjoyable if you don't take it too seriously, but there are some very definite problems. For one thing, it's very repetitive. I can only hope that Sharon Green can manage to tell the story coherently in her subsequent books without retelling every plot point five times. The five main characters are sympathetic and likeable, but they also feel very similar to me. Another point against the characters is that there is very little middle ground. The main characters are victimized to the point of wanting them to quit whining and get on with it already, and the ""bad"" characters have no sympathy whatsoever. The only other thing I didn't like was the fact that it got a bit preachy at times. Overall, I'm not sorry I read it. It was a good bit of light reading, and I look forward to reading the next books."
1,Not for hip replacement patients.,"I purchased this for my husband to use after hip replacement knowing he would need a toilet seat riser. This product is not good for anyone that needs a riser. When you sit down on it-it shrinks to about 1 inch. Once he sat down on it he couldn't get up by himself. No matter how tight the velcro straps, it is still not very stable. I had to go out and buy another one locally that was sturdy."
1,The Golf Ball retriever Saga,"Received the first, retriever in a timely fashion in a most ridiculous huge,huge box. I had to order another retriever as this one arrived defective. The second retriever arrives it needed to be repaired by a friend as these retrievers are cheaply made. I am not returning this one but will never buy another Wilson retriever through the internet. Also, when returning the first retriever I opted to mail it myself you alloted 6.00 for the shipping it cost me 9.20 as you can see on the package. There in lies my saga. Barbara Williams"
1,poor quality doom this product,"I do a lot of golf ball hunting and this retriever is simply not up to the challenge of heavy use. I'm sure it would be fine for the occasional retrieval, but if you plan on using it a lot, expect it to break down pretty quickly"

Get Smacdown 6 Fo Real. smackdown is always the best music day of reckoning dosn't have elimanation chamber or new songs and im sorry you cant use a superstar in season mode you have to use a created person im sorry all you supertar fans.smackdown will always be the bestplus you can crate your own championship belt im serious if you go to IGN you will see the pictures and all he things im telling you go to IGN.com
2,WWE should drop THQ,Why can't THQ make a wrestling game decent? In WWE Day of Reckoning for Gamecube and WWE Raw2 for Xbox has the best created wrestler feature of anything I've ever played. Yet the game play of both games are complete garbage.Then you have WWE Smackdown vs Raw and all Smackdown games before Smackdown vs Raw for the ps2 and it has an amazing gameplay. But the created wrestler feature is pathetic. (Expecially in Smackdown vs Raw)So here is what I don't understand. If THQ makes Smackdown vs Raw and Day of Reckoning. Can't they make a game that has good game play and good created wrestler features?Hello? I've played every THQ wrestling game ever made and I can honestly say that I now hate THQ and I will never buy one of their games again until they get it right.
1,Amazon sent the WRONG phone,"Ordered the UNLOCKED V190 in black, Amazon sent me a LOCKED V190 in SILVER. The label on the box said it was an unlocked black V190, but it seems the order processors at Amazon did not open it to verify if it indeed was a black unlocked V190. There was a silver locked V190 inside.Thus, I returned it and got a refund.If you order this phone, be advised that you may get the wrong one.I rate two thumbs down on this one."
2,Not a US version and I doubt if there will be manufacturer warranty,"I got it when Amazon (3rd party - Blue Center Inc) when they have it for cheap at $58.48 including shipping, but I didn't get exactly as advertised.I got a silver color unit with Spanish or Portugese manual, and the phone is made in Brazil for South America market. Not the US version, and no warrenty card or things like that inside.The colour is not a big deal. But with one thing not exactly as advertised, I am starting to doubt if it is really unlocked and will it work overseas. It will be quite a few months before I travel to Hong Kong, and I feel the urge to find a way to confirm it is really unlocked.It works well for my Cingular/AT&T; simm card.If it is confirmed unlocked and works overseas, that would be a low cost worthwhile purchase, and I will give it more stars."
3,Hardly any truly raw recipes!,"I bought this book because I was interested in old school raw recipes.* I knew the book would be outdated, but I like reading older stuff like that. One outdated thing about the book is that they considered raw food to be anything heated under 140F degrees. It says, ""tempureturs between 140F and 160F start to bring about undesirable changes in the composition of food"". Raw foodists now consider enzyme loss to be between 105F - 120F degrees.* One thing I didn't like about the book is that they are VERY much against 100% raw. The highest they recommend is 80%.* Another thing is the title is false advertising, lol! Almost EVERY recipe calls for milk, cottage cheese or yogurt. There's hardly any truly raw recipes at all.I'm going to try some of the recipes and just use a raw vegan version of the non raw animal products.So, in my opinion, this book is okay. I was hoping it was going to be a 100% raw old school recipe book, but it wasn't."
5,Wonderful Notebook Mouse,"This is the most comfortable, fast, and precise mini mouse ever for a notebook. The retractable cable is very convenient, and the price is reasonable."
2,Left button failed,The product worked well until the left button failed after about 8 months of use. I replaced it with a Logitech wireless mouse that is much more convenient and only a little more expensive.
4,mouse,cord could be longer...I would get the wireless mouse next time but this is lightweight and works well.
1,Tivo is much better,"My friend has a Tivo but I bought a ReplayTV because the service is free. His Tivo is so much better and easier to use. I have returned the ReplayTV and bought a 30 hr Tivo. I hope others don't repeat my mistake.Tivo's show recomendations are great. It learns your viewing habits. It has 10 more hours than Replay, a better remote, and a really good program listing."
4,Changes the way I watch TV,"I wrote an earlier review, so I hope this one gets posted too. I had problems with installation that took a long time to solve. Once over that hurdle, I must admit that this is a terrific product. It changes the way I watch TV. I now watch what I want, when I want. While that was posible with a VCR, Replay makes it much easier. When I watch a previously recorded show with the Reply, it feels like the program is airing then. Also, the fast forward is instantaneous, like on a DVD. Installation was a chore, but the product is worth the effort."
1,An incredible mistake,"This phrase book will not work in China. The phonetic spellngs are given without tones. That is more or less like leaving out the vowels when you tell someone how to pronounce words in English.The book actually tells you that ""in reality"" Mandarin is spoken with tones (p. 7). But it says the tones are hard and so they are left out here. The tones are also necessary. So this book teaches a new made-up version of Mandarin that will not work ""in reality."""
1,Horrible experience ...,I had to give one star .. They sent me something else instead of this product.. It's not Match the one on the picture.. Unfotunately I had to return..
3,Does the job,"I was happy to find bags for my old hand-held Dirt Devil. And, for $7.81 found them a great deal too.I would like the bags better if they had the rubber-type baffles to seal the bag onto the vacuum (the seal is just behind the paper ring) instead of the flimsy plastic ones that these bags have that don't seal as well."
3,Only 8 in package,"These fit our Dirt Devel great; however, the package only included 8 bags rather than the 10 that were supposed to be in the package."
5,"Great bag, great price",Had a hard time finding this bag locally. Took a chance that Amazon would have it. They did...and at a lower price than I paid locally over a year ago.
1,Worst Kept Secret,"This poorly written book purports to give Diane Downs' story of what happened to her unfortunate children.As an answer to Ann Rule's thoughtful ""Small Sacrifices"", it doesn't make the grade in any way. If I had any reservations that Diane may not have comitted the crimes she was convicted of, this nonsense would set me straight.For a woman who is supposed to be very intelligent, Diane comes across as badly educated, transparently manipulative & well...stupid. Her explanations for events leading up to the crimes aren't very convincing, & her alternative to the accepted story is ridiculous.She also seems consumed with rage & completely self obsessed. I certainly had no trouble believing that anyone who got in her way was disposable.It's almost embarrassing as she digs herself a big, big hole trying to explain away facts established at her trial.Read this for a fascinating look at a very disturbed, evil woman."
1,Evil,"is the best word to descibe this woman's personality. This trash should offend anyone with a sense of morality, truth, and justice. Most of all it will offend those who love children. If you are into ice floes and the flowers blooming and the birds singing and the sun shining, then read this garbage. But if you want to take a fascinating journey into the mind of a demented sociopath, then this is a trip you won't want to miss."
1,This woman needs sterilization!,"I read this book out of curiosity, And left with a bitter taste in my mouth and a churning stomach. This woman is a manipulator and a liar at the least.Those poor children will have to live with her actions for the rest of their lives, I hope they never feed into her garbage, either out of curiosity or a vague sense of family, because you know even miminal contact would have this loony believing she was a part of their lives again. Don't waste your time or your money.( I couldn't find a way to give it no stars, it doesnt even deserve the one)"
5,Very Satisfied,"My book was Communicating Effectively by: Sandra Hybels and Richard Weaver the 8th edition(2007). I ordered it on 9-17-09 and I received the book on 9-19-09. I did pay the express shipping, but that was great! My class started on 9-22-09 so I needed it asap. The book was used and in very good condition. It was a great low price!"
2,Looks great...until you wash them.,"I bought a couple of these sets for myself. Was pleased with them as they seemed pretty heavy, looked nice, and the edges weren't rough. Then I got into the second box...the serving set did not match the pattern of the silverware. Of course, when I contacted Amazon this pattern was out of stock so I couldn't exchange them.Also, DO NOT PUT THESE IN THE DISHWASHER!! THEY ARE HIGHLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO CORROSION & RUST! Something I found out the hard way. Now I have to wash them all by hand.I paid $15/set, so I didn't expect much. The saying ""you get what you pay for"" certainly applies here. But in hindsight, I'd probably have saved my money and purchased a more quality set."
5,Table setting,"I was very impressed with the quality of the tablesetting. The pieces are comfortable in the hand and have ""weight"" to them. Very well worth the price for an eight piece set! Best part was the extra serving pieces, a surpirse bonus."
5,Every woman should read this book!,"I am a menopausal mother with a pubescent daughter. Both of us are free of hormonal troubles, thanks largely to the advice of this terrific book. It is so full of facts and figures, from both regular and alternative medicine. It covers every possible scenario. I can't imagine anyone that couldn't find a solution for their specific needs. This book is easy to use because each chapter relates to your specific interest, or you can read it cover to cover, which I suggest, since it has great advice on living a successful, healthful, stress free life. I particularly like how, at the end of a chapter, you're given ways to assess your condition and ""to do"" lists that help solve specific problems. It's written in an easy to understand conversational style. I've given it to both my sisters and many of my friends."
1,Great if you play by ear,"Brad Davis is great player and these are great arrangements. However, they come with no tablature. Tablature is available from a download site, but is not available for all versions, and the versions that are available are filled with errors. In addition to numerous small error there are serious conceptual errors. In particular, whoever did the transcriptions didn't seem to understand the concept of a pickup beat. Thus the marked measures and chord changes come one beat too early in many of the tunes. This gave me a terrible time for about 6 months - I thought my playing was awful and that I couldn't get the synchronization right even to play backup chords. Once I figured out what was going on, I was so P.O.ed that I decided not to use them anymore, even though I finally figured out how to correct them. Unless you can play by ear, or are proficient enough to be able to catch and correct the errors, I would not recommend these."
4,Pretty good,"I have read 15 of Andrew Neiderman's 29 novels and loved every one of them This was not my very favorite, but is readable because of the surprize ending which I had not even considered during the course of the novel. Most books try to make me believe one or another character is the culprit but this didn't. I like dark psychological novels with a tad of supernatural thrown in and this fits the bill."
4,Junior Brown,"My Husband just loves Junior Brown. I bought this for his birthday because it had different songs on it than one he has. Junior Brown doesn't play here in Colorado, so all we have his his CD's!"
2,"I am CRAZY about Junior Brown, but...","How crazy am I? My wife and a bunch of friends will be flying out to Texas just to see him crazy. I'm too old and the wrong sex to be a groupie, but if I weren't -- you know what I'm saying.Having said that, this is JB's worst album. Buy two ""12 Shades of Brown"" instead, and give one to a friend.See you in Austin."
5,"Professional look, high quality, comfortable","This is probably the best laptop bag I have ever owned. It is very compact, but that is what makes you feel not-like a school boy. Looks are not what's most important in life and this bag does not stop there. The materials feel durable, the zippers are easy to operate, the computer seems well protected, water shielded, and the weight on one's back passes almost unnoticed. I think the price is appropriate, as most vendors of high quality products advertise that good quality should equal high price; Lowepro does not."
5,Excellent choice for me!,In my work I have to board ships on a daily basis. This usually involves climbing steep ladders in order to get on board. This backpack allows me to maintain my balance while going up and down the ladders while carrying all my paperwork and supplies. It is roomy and easily accomodates the various items I need to carry. The exterior cell phone pocket and water bottle holder come in handy too! The construction of the bag is superior and I think it will withstand our harsh winters and elements quite well. I expect it will last me a few years despite the constant handling it endures. For the money this was an excellent choice. It works well for me!
4,So far so good...,"Well I got this because of all the great reviews and recomentations from a lot of knife blogs, and to tell you the truth it works well. I have a knife that I use it on a lot because its carbon steel (Esse 4) and have only seen very small rust stains on it, what I do is resharpen it and it takes the spots off and then I just clean the knife with the cloth and it stays rust proof for quite some time. Its a shame Amazon doesnt offer prime shipping on this item, would buy more. Overall a good product if somethat expensive."
5,the acid aspiration-cable,"""David Lynch manufactured the human body pill paradise apparatus of a drug fetus and pluged-in the acid aspiration-cable made of retro-ADAM to the cruel emulator of a chemical=anthropoid. "" - Kenji Siratori, author of Blood Electric"
1,WHAT!>?,I have no idea what these films were supposed to be! This movie no joke caused me to throw up. I don't recommend it.
3,Underground 2 not too good,"I think Underground was better than Underground 2. Driving around the city is cool at first, but it becomes a huge hassle as the game wears on. It just gets more boring and boring as the game goes on, so I'm looking forward to NFS Most Wanted to add the new cop pursuit element. PEACE!"
5,Best racing game ever!!!!!!,"Hey you who said theres a fool born every minute this game happens to be awesome! I love games where you get to go everywhere in the city so this games for me. I love the music. Too bad you can't keep the car you start out in but if you unlock all the extras you can build an even better car! My only complaint is so far i haven't been unlock any of the other sections of the city, and you don't get to drive a diablo or murcilago.Pros- excellent graphics,get to explore,Hit music.Cons-none so far"
4,2nd best game i've ever played(ATV3 is favorite),This game is very cool.Any one who likes driving fast around town would like this game.I really like it.
1,Do not work on Palm OS,I have a tungsten T5 and bought this wifi card instead of the original Palm Wifi Card to have wireless Internet access from Hotspots. Unfortunately this Lan Card has been not recognized by the Palm OS. There is even no driver for this operational system at the manufacter 's home page. So if you intend to buy a lan card for your palm I suggest to check the compatibility of your Operational System before you make the mistake I've done. Regards...
3,Not what i expected but okay...,"Well this is not all that great but not all that bad. It applies easily and took me about 10 minutes to put all four door handles on. You have to clean the handles on your car first, then dry them off, then get any excess oil or dirt off (use a towel with rubbing alcohol). The adhessive stick, on the back of the chrome handles, sticks well but my major promblem is with how they dont fit all the way around the handle. They look awesome from afar but as you come to the door you can see that this is a stick-on handle. It just looks cheap to me. Doesnt even compete with the real thing of chrome door handles. So to sum this all up its good if you want a cheap, looking chrome finish.PROS:- easy to apply- looks great (from afar)CONS:- cheap look- you can see your door handle and the chrome put on- makes the chrome handle look like a sticker"
2,Didnt expect it too be so small,The thing is way too tiny. i did try it you must use water or lube or you will have trouble putting your pecker in there lol. but anyways when you finish it makes a huge mess because theres a hole at the end of it and the thing is like 3 inches long. it's decent worth the 10 bucks. but i suggest you get something better for personal use. this will work better if you have someone helping you
3,Way to Small!,I know I should have read the description better before I purchased this product. I bought it out of curiosity and it does what i wanted it to do but I can only get about a third of myself inside of it. Even with lubrication it is extremely tight and uncomfortable. Does anyone know of a larger version of this product?
4,not the first seconds flat recording,"This is a document of one of many seconds flat lineups, this one turned out pretty well. good songs and a high level of production. They did their first CD at Kingsway studios in New Orleans with the now somebody, Trina Shoemaker. One of the original songwriters, Scott Allen was no longer with the band at this point, the original bass player, Mike Henson and guitar player Kevin Latham are also not involved in this recording. Scott has a good solo record in the can and Kevin and Mike are with an SC band , the black lungs. They should have a recording out pretty soon, from a new studio, Sit n Spin located in downtown Greenvile SC. Larry is playing with Mack McCloud and the Hipshakers and has some new recordings with his wife Molly."
1,Maneaters Are Loose,"Excellant cast. Bad viewing quality: faded color, blurry, indistinct images. Badly needs to be remastered or stop selling it. Story okay. Box arrived damaged and this was a replacement for the same thing in a broken box. Would have liked to know age of product and that it had never been upgraded."
2,movie madness,"the movie Maneaters are loose was awful, the resolution of the film was horriable it was so foggey and barely had any color to it i was very dissappointed in the product,."
3,Winnetou; spaghetti western in books,"Good for children's library and as vacation reading.K. May is one of the romantic story writers, writing after the western travel-stories role model; like many before who made a good sell but did poor favour to the public imagination ( misconceptions) of the countries and cultures they wrote about.For expl. Albert Fortis travel writings...I used to watch the Winnetou film serial and identified with the characters and story, and was surprised at older age to learn that my favorite ""indian"" film was filmed in Croatia!BTW, Does anyone know where to get those tapes?"
4,Fifa Soccer is a good sega soccer game,This game is cool for a Sega Genesis game. you have many teamsto choose from all over the world. The crowd sounds great andchant songs from there nation. This a good game for Sega Genesisperiod.
5,GREATEST CUSTOMER SERVICE,"I'm rating the customer service as being 5 star. The shoes were purchased for my granddaughter who just had to have saddle shoes. Unfortunately,she has a very wide foot and most of the favorites do not fit her. This was the case here. The shoes were beautiful but, as usual, there were not wide enough for her foot. I contacted the company, they responded immediately with a postage-paid sticker for return shipping. I sent them back by UPS and the company acknowledge receipt of the shoes when they received them. Refund was returned to my credit card within a few days. I couldn't have asked for better service from a company."
5,warning...this is addictive.....,"I know, some of you might be raising your eyebrows over this ""faux"" jerky (with no weird artifical ingredients or nitrates), but it is actually really good. It's made out of soy protein, and tastes enough like meat to sustain even the most carnivorous apetites. Jerquee Soy has the right combination of jerky texture (something good to chew on), and spicy flavor. Enjoy.....it's good stuff....."
3,"Good entry portal, but Unix not required","This is a good place to start for the computer person who wants to get into Bioinformatics. There are overviews of the many biological issues involved, and URLs aplenty to get more information and download software. However, the emphasis on Unix as the platform of choice is becoming less and less relevant. Very few bioinformatics programs are available only on Unix, and many are available only on Windows and not Unix. Researchers who already know Windows and/or have access to departmental support for their Windows systems are ill-advised to get into the morass of setting up and supporting a Linux or other Unix machine."
1,Everything is so superficial!,This book deals about everything but bioinformatics. You need to know far more biology than computing to do this. Just fire up the biology workbench ... with the biology student workbench ... and see! These are free web sites sand tools so most of the material in this book is irrelevant.
4,Pleasantly surprising,"Against my better judgement (too many Billy Mays mishaps) I ordered Frequensea. I've been taking it now for about four days, and I have to say the differences I feel are subtle, but well worth the cost of the product. So far, the quality of my sleep has improved- I sleep deeply, and I get up a little earlier than I normally have been- and feel great when I get up! My energy is overall improved- I don't get bursts of energy when I drink Frequensea, however throughout the day I don't get that rundown feeling. We'll see what else comes after prolonged use! So far, I'm happy!"
3,The Catholic Feminist View of Patriarchy,"The Female Face in Patiarchy: Oppression As Culture specifically explores the female participation in oppression by the Catholic Church and, thereby, slightly explores the oppression of women in American and Brazilian cultures generally. Without women's support the exploitation of women would cease in short order according to the authors of this scholarly work. Women not only support the supression of women in the Catholic Church, but actively supress women attempting to change the condition for themselves and others. The book is a radically feminist report that I would recommend to my Catholic friends and people in general. We all need to take a closer look at the condition we live in and take part in. There are times when a radical look will capture our attention more quickly than a subtle one. This is one. Can we afford to wait?"
5,Wonderful cd!,"I received this cd as a gift years ago, and it is my absolute favorite Christmas CD. The music is beautiful!"
2,Get what you pay for,"This is a good, cheap, unit. But mine occassionally flickers, loses color and has other picture problems. In general it doesn't interefere with watching."
2,Polished to the point of boring.,"With the exception of ""The Other Guy,"" the songs on this CD are virtually indistinguishable from the studio versions. Except for the polite applause in between tracks, one would never know that this is a live CD. There is no vocal banter between the band and the audience, and there is no new material.As such, if you already have the studio versions of these songs, there is no reason to own this CD.This release is only for those like me who own every Little River Band CD and want to keep their collections complete. Casual fans would be better advised to buy either Little River Band's Greatest Hits or 20th Anniversary collections. These two releases already have all of the well-known classics found on the Birtles Shorrock Goble CD. However, you would also be getting all of the best songs from lead singer John Farnham, a superior vocalist who left Little River Band to become the best-selling solo performer of all time in Australia."
4,A Touching Tragicomedy,"Eloise had a love affair with an American writer, George, few years back while holidaying in America. But the affair ends when George decided to stay with his wife. The separation left Eloise bitter and disillusioned with men in general. There are a few extravagant characters in the story and they all meet at the closing chapters for an unexpected finale.The writer borrows various texts, poems, lyrics and statistics from other works, which gives the book a taste of freshness.There is a high element of British humour about the book but it comes together with a touching profundity. It makes very enjoyable reading. END"
2,Nice idea--poor execution.,"At first I was delighted with this item.Now, I am disappointed from a design standpoint. First, if the pipe to which you attach this product is up against the wall, then you cannot tighten the screws on the clamp, can you? Because you cannot get behind the wall. Inspect the photo: why can you not tighten the clamp from the front??Second, why can't this product be attached to a HORIZONTAL pipe, which is my, and many others' case?Regretfully,d."
3,Bad acting,"My girls LOVE all the air bud movies! They even love this one! But I just can't stand to watch it!! The lead girls acting is soooooo bad! I gave it 3 stars for my girls, but I would give it no stars! Sorry!"
5,A great twentieth-century mystic.,"Richard Wurmbrand is one of those rare treasures hidden from view. These essays were written in prison and memorized, then penned upon his release. While prison can break a person's spirit, it can also become a place of meeting. Wurmbrand's essays reflect the challenge and reality of meeting God in the darkest moments. Each essay is a new discovery of God's grace. I read and reread Wurmbrand."
1,5.8GHZ EDGE 3-HAND/ANSWR,"Horrible product, don't waist your money. You can only talk on one phone at a time. Bad for those family conference calls. Range is poor and the quality of the calls are scratchy."
2,not the best,"As an earlier reviewer pointed out, a lot of the ""flowers"" in here don't really look like flowers. I was put off by the prettier ones requiring cutting and glueing. Also, most of the flower patterns just fall apart once you put them together. The way that you secure the petals to each other is not secure, so don't think that once you make the flower it will keep together for 2 seconds (unless of course you glue them). The only plus to the kit for this was the bonus paper, which is why I gave it two stars rather than one."
3,Wacky Proof Reading,"Although there are several mistakes in this book such as the first line, in the Sate of West Virginia, well then there is the cases at the end of the book where you are suppose to go to different pages to find the trial court decisions as well as appeals court, one I noticed was missing and others were located on other pages. That being said I did enjoy this book, it was very strange that some of these laws actually made it on the books, what I would be interested to know is what lead up to them. Very funny read and excellent gift I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in law or just funny crap."
2,Not as shown in photo,"I am very unhappy.....I ordered the medium size cot.Apparently the photo advertised must be a large dog cot, as it has an extra set of legs in the middle, Mine does not. I feel that this is false advertising. The one shown would be far sturdier. I will not be likely to order anything again."
2,Disappointing though love at first sight,"I loved this bed when we first got it. I was trying to provide an alternative to our 40-pound chocolate lab wallowing in dirt. I was happy that the bed was big enough and could not wait to present it to Beau. Unfortunately, unless Beau sat directly in the center, the bed became wobbly, making Beau very hesitant to relax on it. He preferred to use it as a very expensive chew toy instead and I still have to hear my hubby's ""I told you so's"" since throwing the cot out."
4,"Can make espresso grind if ""hacked""","I bought this burr mill over a year ago and had been disappointed that it did not produce acceptable espresso grind (it was far too course even at the fine setting), although it produced a nice, coarse grind for my French press. Due to its design, I don't feel like I am getting it completely clean when I remove the top burr and use a brush (as directed in the manual); I would think that residual oils from the beans accumulate on the gears. It is the first mill or grinder that I've owned and for the price is quite good, in my opinion (assuming no need for espresso grind). That was until this morning. I happened to read the review by E. H. Hanks ""Radtek"", in which he detailed a clever modification he made which allows for a much finer grind suitable for espresso. I just pulled a shot of espresso after making the modification and I'm even more satisfied with this Mr. Coffee product now.Thanks, Radtek."
1,Coffee dust = bitter coffee,"I have had this grinder for over a year. I'm shopping for a replacement, and when this model popped up on Amazon, I decided to write a review and perhaps save others the trouble.My reason for wanting to replace it is that it creates a fair amount of coffee dust, regardless of the grind setting. Even after sifting the grounds through a screen, there is still enough dust remaining to make my coffee very bitter and unpleasant to drink. Every single cup of coffee I have made using grounds from this grinder has been bitter. I primarily use a French press, but I get the same result in a drip maker. I've been fiddling with the water to grounds ratio, water temps, brew times, etc for a year and I have concluded that the bitterness is not my fault--it's the grinder's.There has to be a better grinder at the same price level (or even a lower one). I wouldn't recommend this model to anyone."
1,Don't take this one off the shelf,"As a very picky coffee drinker I have tried several grinders in the past but I really liked the size and looks of the Mr. Coffee.I purchased the larger size at Costco and liked the way it worked and made much less of a mess after grinding than my former Capresso. But after 3 short months it just stopped working. It was returned to Mr. Coffee and after a very long wait they sent me a new one but they sent the smaller size, listed here.(And didn't bother to reimburse me the difference in cost) Said the larger one had some problems and it was discontinued. After only 2 months this one stopped working also. Just flat out would not turn on. Needless to say I will not be buying another Mr. Coffee product."
1,I am sorry....,"I should have saved my money. I bought it so that I could grind my own beans for espresso. It is totally inadequate. I does not grind anywhere near fine enough for expresso. The grind is not consistent, even for a drip pot.I checked the reviews before I purchased this machine, but apparently no one had tried it for expresso...There are plenty of negative reviews about it, now, so, hopefully, others will not make the same mistake.I will use it, occasionally, for my drip coffee pot, but will continue to buy my beans, for expresso, and grind them at the super market!"
5,Outstanding book!,"I originally bought this book when it first was issued in paperback. While packing to move over 10 years ago, I gave away 15 boxes of books, including this one. I've regretted it ever since, and have often spoken of the book to my family and friends. Finally, I decided to get another copy, and I've enjoyed it as much as the first time through.It is well-written, well-paced, and speaks of what might be for the Catholic Church (I'm a cradle Catholic) were to be led by someone with the simple humanity of Papa Francesco! Despite the pretty much inevitable denouement, I was still captivated by the story and inspired by the fictional life of this man."
4,Great Fan,"I bought this over a year ago, and still is fully functional unlike other fans I've bought. Produces very low noise. The only thing I don't like is that if you attach it to a fan speed regulated connection on your motherboard, the light will not be steady, the frequency will vary with the fan speed. So if you need or like the light connect it to the IDE standard energy connection. If you like the speed fan control you can cut the light cables."
3,Soccer Practice Games,"Good book, easy games with comprensive images, is a good book to start to teach how introduce the principles of soccer.Is a book you must be have in your library."
1,"To heavy to be a fashion watch, to fragile to be a sport watch.",Title says it well.Crystal shattered when watch fell from a height of 18 inches. Not what I expect from a sport watch. Crystal is not covered by warrenty.Very heavy watch with solid stiff band.
5,Fantastic Strap,"I LOVE this guitar strap. It locks into my Fender Squier Strat perfectly and it's sturdy. Cool design as well. Comfortable. 5 stars. I highly recommend this if it fits your guitar. Some people mentioned it didn't work with their guitar, however I went ahead and bought it anyway and it works with my Fender."
3,User-friendliness FAIL,"First of all, I'm about to buy a second one because I like the features so much. You get a quality strap and a reliable locking mechanism for a good price.Problem is: the locking parts are so bulky that they will not fit on all guitars. I have a superstrat-ish Washburn and even the top horn pin doesn't fit well. What this means is that the thin rubber coating has been quickly shredded by rubbing on the guitar. I had to unscrew both pins a little bit so that the ends of the strap don't rub on the guitar.It's good value if it works out for your guitar, otherwise it would be a PITA. Good idea, flawed design."
5,Works On My Schecter C-1,"I bought this for my Schecter C-1 guitar and it works as advertised. It seems extremely sturdy and so far it was worth the price. I know some people said it didn't fit their guitar, so I just wanted to add the Schecter C-1 as a guitar it will fit on."
3,Record collectors and music devotees listen up,"A conscientious effort written by a musician concentrating on Mr Evans' recorded legacy with considerable detail and assessment on the various records issued. As Mr Evans was more concerned with music than any other thing in his life, I'm sure he would approved. But the feeling that was the essential element in everything Mr Evans produced is somewhat absent in this bio. Not a gripping read but one I would not be without."
2,missing linq?,"This game sounds good in description, but is difficult to play. There are so many cards and if one gets lost, some where in the deck, you have to sort through them. Too high of maintenence for my liking, and haven't really played the game at all."
3,The weakest song on the album,"I think that overall, Counterfeit 2 is a great album, but this song is easily the weakest link. Don't judge the whole of the album from this one song. Listen to Tiny Girls or Loverman and you'll understand where it's going. But Stardust just didn't do it for me."
3,Interesting,"I'm delighted to see this re-issue of a long time favorite of our family's. The book is good to have along with the CD, as the words on the CD are difficult to understand. That's a real disappointment--especially since it is geared toward young children who are just learning to talk. The enunciation on the CD is muddled.Knowing this, I would still probably buy it since the instrumental music is clear and memorable, but I would only play it when I could be with the child and correct the enunciation as we sing. I give it a 3 1/2."
4,Beautiful creation....,"I chose this item after reading other reviews on it. The illustrations are fabulous! The contents are just that of the song but perfect for ""little"" viewers. Clever inclusion of the CD in the back of the book for storage. I bought one for a gift and then ordered a second one for myself. After previewing the book and listening to the CD it would have been hard to give it away. I'm so glad to have one around to share with guests."
4,Magic Dragon,"Puff, the Magic Dragon has lingered in the minds and hearts of this family for decades. Of course, we each had our own interpretation of the story in the song. Now my grandchildren squeeze out the Peter, Paul, and Mary song from an old and cracked record. What a great surprise to find that the book and CD have been published!! I can understand why the author originally did not want to interfere with each person's own visual interpretation of Puff, the Magic Dragon. Therefore, the illustrations in the book are a bit disappointing by comparison. However, in the long run, we are glad to have the book with the book flap information, and very happy to have the CD."
5,An old favorite,We were so excited to find this old song in a book form. It's a perfect bedtime story that brings me back to my childhood.
2,Puff's Musical Magic is Missing,"The illustrations by Eric Puybaret are interesting, unique and imaginative and if there could be a separate rating I'd give them 5-Stars.Peter Yarrow's singing seemed tired, but was tolerable.What is absolutely unacceptable are the two words that were noticably ""inserted"" and sound like a skip! The original lyrics, ""A Dragon lives forever, but not so little boys"", have been revised to, ""A Dragon lives forever, but not so little GIRLS AND boys."" Gosh, we can't have a song that is only about a little boy? This poorly executed and tacky revision ruined the book and CD."
2,disappointing,"I ordered this book online for a Christmas present for my 5-year-old daughter and I was really disappointed by it. The pictures are kind of boring, the book is way too big to cuddle up with at night (plus it's hard cover), and the CD is also really boring. My daughter didn't even listen to it once and only breifly looked at the book before pushing it aside. Not worth the money I spent on it for sure."
3,A great story,"I love the story, but this book could have been better. It's truly just the words to the song and then illustrated. I'd have liked it told as a story, but it's still nice, and a well made book"
3,Accounting software for small business,"+ easy to start using this product, I like user interface+ added custom fields functionality- to create reports with custom fields you have to have Word 2003 and up- in payment method no option to use ""wire transfer"" or ""debit card"" (you have to write a check or use cash instead)- import of bank files is pointless, you have to type in everything anyways during data matching process- to import transactions or custom fields you have to purchase add-onIn general this product is usable, but it requires some improvement."
5,Free upgrade to 2009 verson.,"Accounting Professional is not easy to learn how to use. But that is no fault of the program. Its a matter how accounting savoy you are. I recommend this program to businesses that have inventory. Because it provides the required ""cost of goods sold"" at the end of each year. As of this writing you can buy the 2007 version and upgrade to the 2009 version for free.Dennis S Sayer, Brand Name Batteries for LessR3E4O3HSJLL1A6"
2,"Clunky, slow","As a Quickbooks user of many years, I upgraded my Microsoft Office to 2007 and thought switching over to its accounting program would be worth the ease of integration into other Office documents. I found the concepts of this software worthy and intelligent but the implementation was slow and clunky compared to Quickbooks--not as easy or intuitive to edit nor did it memorize tasks or tags as much--maybe the 2008 version has improved on these, but too late, I went back to Quickbooks which is faster and easier."
2,OK - Seat,"I was disappointed that the cup holders come off too easy, they button onto the car seat and it isn't strong enough so when my boys try to stuff their juice or water in them they snap right back off. The are no longer attached to the seats because I refuse to keep putting them back on.I guess this seat is okay, it is nice and plush but the downside to getting a backless seat (which I didn't think about before I purchased this) was the fact that the kids can't fall asleep in these seats. My kids like I am sure most kids are when they go for a drive the motion knocks them right out. But because there is nothing to support their head and neck they slump over and are very uncomfortable so they usually don't fall asleep unless they are just really beat and then I worry because I don't want them to get a crook in their neck.I can say that this seat is very lightweight which is a big change coming from the regular child seat."
2,Bland and Wordy,"I was excited to read this book after it was recommended because of my interest in The Knight in Rusty Armor, but this book is nothing like The Knight in Rusty Armor. It starts off okay and I think it could have been more interesting and helpful if it hadn't been so wordy and taken so long to get to the point. I had to force myself to pick it back up, because it really bothers me to not finish a book. Hope this review helps."
5,Book is great!,This book is very informative for people who do not do well in History class. It is easy to understand.
5,Greatest Band EVER!!!,"HIM has done it again. I was speechless after I first heard ""Razorblade Romance""...mesmerized after listening to ""Deep Shadows And Brilliant Highlights"" and was a mixture of the two after listening to the ""Love Metal"" album. I can't stop listening to it over and over again. With great lyrics, awesome guitar solos...how could you not like this album?? If your a HIM fan...you have to buy this album!! You definitly won't regret it!!!!!!"
1,physical interrogation techniques,"this book is not really well researched. I have seen more effective interrogations where the interrogators used persuasion and sleep deprevation to elicit needed information. torture is a last resort and then the information is of dubious value. This book is ok for some sort of highschool rambo wannabe to dream thier little nightmares, but, a professional would not use the methods here to get good intel. this book is your basic excuse for causing pain needlessly. interrogation is a very tricky art and few get it down pat. If you are looking for a manual,, this is not it."
1,Natioanlistic Tripe,"While not BAD music, per se, along the order of pop trash such as your NSYNCs and your Brittney clones, this pablum panders to the lowest common denominator just as shamelessly as they.I would rather stick pencils in my ears than to hear the album again. I received it as a gift - and I no longer speak to the giver."
2,God Bless the USA,"I love the song GOD BLESS THE USA, but the version on this CD is not the one I am used to hearing on the radio. I've also had trouble with the sound fading in and out on this track."
5,PG&E at Their Blues-Rockin' Live Best,"A real nice 5-piece blues-based, rock and roll band kickin' out the jams, live in Lexington, KY. I'm glad someone realized they had this concert and released the audio for our enjoyment. This is 2 guitars, bass and drums blues-based rock and roll at its finest, vintage 1970. Yowza!"
1,disapointed,"it takes two people to set this up once you figure out how the first time, since it never came with instructions. i had to take two pieces of rubber hose to keep them from coming out at the top to hold the rear poles in place at the top. for the money its not bad. i keep hitting the ball over the top if i dont stand very close to it i say a club shafts lenth. save your money buy a better net from your pro shop."
1,Broken when it came out of the box,"Net was not stitched to the edge properly, and had a 5 inch hole to boot. We tried to set it up anyway, but with no instructions in the box and very flimsy parts, we gave up. This product is a waste of your hard earned money."
2,Just ok,Decent effort but it lacked sufficient plot to intrigue and compell me to keep reading. The characters were predictable and too one-dimensional.
1,I must be crazy.,"I think that I am clearly insane, but I did not like this book. Everyone else in the world likes this book, but i am the insane person who does not. And I'm NOT sarcastic! I could barly read it a second time. I hated this book."
3,A fun tale of personal triumph,"Beautiful Quotes:""I keep thinking about a tale my nurse used to read to me about a bird whose wings are pinned to the ground. In the end, when he finally frees himself, he flies so high he becomes a star. My nurse said the story was about how we all have something that keeps us down.""""There you go...let it all slide out. Unhappiness can't stick in a person's soul when it's slick with tears [p. 173].""I had heard that Shannon Hale's youth fiction was pretty good so I decided to try out this one. I'd read her Austenland book about a year ago and thought it was OK so I was a bit hesitant to try out her other books. Overall, I thought this was a fun book. It took a bit for me to get into it, but towards the end it really came alive. I thought Hale's book did a fantastic job of painting the tiny village of Mount Eskel for me to see. Her book focuses on the importance of family, community ties, and being true to yourself. A great story of triumph for those of all ages!"
4,Not as good as Goose Girl,"After reading The Goose Girl, a very good book by the way, I was having high hopes for Ms. Hale's newest novel. When I recieved the book I read it immediatly, finishing it in a day. I have mixed feelings about this book. The writing was still superb with all the eloquence of the previous book. The thing that bothered me about The Princess Academy was the plot and the some of the ending. The plot was completely different than the last book and different isn't necessarily bad, but it didn't compare.The ending with Britt was also quickly introduced without much build-up. I rather enjoyed Miri's ending though. She was a character who had a lot of depth and I could relate to her.All in all, the novel was enjoyable and was just another example of Ms. Hale's wonderful writing skills.I decided"
4,"A good, solid read","Princess Academy is a great book, and a perfect summer read for adolescent girls. The author does a wonderful job of describing the characters, as well as the world that they live in, and makes good use of creative metaphors. Many unique ideas appear throughout the text; it doesn't feel derivitave or cliched. The ending, in particular, manages to be surprising and satisfying while still retaining a ""happily ever after"" feel. Overall, it's endearing, original, and a fun, breezy read (the 300+ pages go at a fast clip), for those who have outgrown Cinderella but still enjoy the magic of fairy tales. Not to mention the lovely cover art!"
5,Centered keyboard is fantastic!,"I am right handed, but I realized that I had elbow pain from reaching over to the left to type. Having the mouse and the keypad on the right makes for very left placed alpha keys. Since I got this keyboard, I can type in the middle of the tray and my elbows, wrists and shoulders have really felt the difference. There was a bit of learning curve to use the numeric keypad with my left hand, but I learned it very quickly. It is much more efficient to us the mouse with my right and type numbers with my left. I love this keyboard."
4,Very Nice Keyboard,"Pros: This keyboard is full sized and fairly easy on the fingers. No problems with it after over a month of daily use. It has a high-quality feel. It's the best lefty keyboard I could find, and I'm glad I spent the extra money.Cons: Like others have said, it's noisy. It clacks. If you type a lot of text in the vicinity of others, you should think twice, especially if you really don't need the ten-key on the left.Conclusion: Love this keyboard. For me with ten-key needs on my left hand due to a major right-arm injury, it's perfect. It has possibly saved my job. The ability to mouse with my right hand and ten-key with the left at the same time also has the potential to make me even faster than before, and might have some advantages in some PC video games."
3,"+5 for Rat Pack, +1 for movie = glad I saw it","This movie is for fans only, i think.Disc 2.35:1 Widescreen Enhanced. Dolby Mono excellent quality video / audio track - well, what can you say... it was shot on a set.Budget couldn't have gotten any lower i think, and there are plenty of holes in the script.This wasn't a comedy, it was an attempt at a serious ""Calvary and Indians"" with a couple chuckles, and a little bit of romance stuck in... it was truly a "" a LITTLE something for everyone"".Low budget, saturday afternoon TV western script aside, this was one heck of a treat.Be warned - if you're not a fan of the Rat Pack, I'm sure you could find something better to watch - but if you're a fan, you'd best get your hands on this gem and own it for your library!"
4,A modern interpretation of an old classic by Peter Kelder,"Highly opinionated, but well-argued & clearly explained, while i disapprove of Kilham's audacity in renaming the 5 chakra-based exercises from Kelder's original Fountain of Youth publication from the 1930s 'The 5 Tibetans' (fyi i have since finding out about & practicing them these past 7 years called them 'The Tibetan Rites exercises', which is much more in accordance with what the original author, Kelder, called them), i appreciate his explainations vis-a-vis chakras, etc, & agree with some of his views about the exercises themselves. The photos & instructions are also a little easier to grasp than in the original Kelder book/manual. I also own the original, but feel that this is a handy addition, as a summary of the whole, which will serve MOST folks as well as, or better than, reading the original. After all = bottom line; the MORE people practice these yogic exercises, the better!!!"
4,5 Tibetans,Not able to do all 5 exercises but the meditation suggestions were helpful. This book has some good information related to Chrakras and is readable. Also the photos of the author demonstrating the exercises were inspiring!
4,"WHICH ""Fisher County History""?","There are TWO Fisher County, TX histories - one from 1971 and another from 1983. Yeats collaborated, to the best of my knowledge, only on the 1971 version. Hooper Shelton and the Fisher County Historical Commission collaborated on both the 1971 and the 1983 versions. I have both versions and have indexed the 1983 version.Both are very similar in content. Both give a decent background history for the county without going into too much detail to bog the reader down. The buyer should be aware that there are reprints of the 1983 version (w/o the dj) on the market. Both books are more ""county"" history, rather than of serious genealogical content, although, there is much to be found in both versions."
5,Best non-English album that I ever heard,"I'm a big fan of Delirious? for some time.So, I decided to try this one, even though I don't understand Spanish at all.This CD just surprised me, it was way much better than my expectation.even though the songs are the same, but it's like you hear a brand new songs.I highly recommend this CD for everybody who is a fan of Delirious? and those who looking for a quality band even maybe if you don't understand the language.Music is universal, language barrier won't limit the soul of the music."
3,"Good for beginners, but could be better for others","Overall, this book gives solid advice on the fundamentals. Great for beginners and intermediates who need a reveiw of key fundamentals. It needs some improvement on the example pictures. Possibly using pictures of real people in action demonstrating the subject matter would be better than the hand drawn pictures. Multi-framed pictures of the ground strokes and serves would be a great improvement. The exercises and drill didn't do much for me, but suppose would be helpful for others."
4,Well done,"Book is in a good condition. It was send, however, a bit tool ate. Everything else is wonderful."
2,good for the money though,i got my vibrator today and couldn't wait to try it. it has lots of settings which is good but cannot feel the pearls at all. i couldn't tell really which way this were going. it is slimmer than most which was also a let down. i only paid $8.70 for it which is better than over $100. just don't expect much out of this product especially if you have used things like this many times.
5,Excellent Christmas Album,"I saw Sawyer Brown last year at Christmas in concert, and I knew I had to have this cd. I was so moved by the beautiful original songs and the new versions of the classics.Even the people at the concert who thought they'd be hearing only traditional Sawyer Brown music were mesmerized by the beautiful songs. They got a very long standing ovation at the end. I've already started listening to it this year and will probably have it wore out by Christmas!"
5,"Super Colon Cleanse, Dietary Supplement, Good Source of Fiber",Picked up 2 bottles of this and I must say (speaking for self) that my deliveries have been the same (not as frequent as I would like). Of course this may be different for you for which I can not speak of. Give if a try. Ordered this while Storm Sandy was going on and still received overseas in a timely manner. Thanks. Would recommend.
4,don't take recommended dose,It started off bad. I wasn't able to drive normally to work - had to make bathroom stops. But then wnen I was about to return this product I read the reviews and reduced the dose. Then it worked as expected.
1,unable to try,"Unfortunately I was unable to use these as the company shipped them to me with a broken seal. I was told no replacement would be given. Based on reviews, I was excited to try. So it was dissappointing to open the package to a open bottle."
2,I don't think it's working?,"Took 4 pills last night at 5 or 6 pm to test it out. I started to feel something was stirring down there, but nothing surprising or uncomfortable. I figured maybe I'll up the dose to another 4 after an hour and activity below increased however nothing really happened besides a very small bowel movement. Honestly Ive had a better and faster BM after eating curry. I'm going to try 12 throughout the day for two days more ,but if nothing happens I'll just stick to curry..... it's tastier and more effective."
3,Horrible taste!!!,"I bought the powder because I did not want to take all of those capsules. This stuff is like drinking dried out grass and dirt. It does work, if you can get it down. I was not able to last for the full 10-14 days because I was afraid of my electrolytes getting out of whack. It seems to be a super strong laxative and would suggest using it when you have time off because you will be running to the bathroom A LOT! I got kind of crampy after the 3rd to 4th day, so I stopped using it. Did not notice any weight loss but it did seem to clean things out because after a few days, going to the bathroom became kind of disgusting. If you can get it down, I would suggest it, but I got the same results with a senna laxative for a lot less hassle."
5,Thank goodness it works!,"I bought this Super Colon Cleanse largely because of the good reviews it had on Amazon.com. I had been ""blocked up"" for the past couple weeks. Very bloated, uncomfortable, constant ""full"" feeling, etc...The day I started this, I ""went"". It wasn't an uncontrollable feeling, but just that things were finally starting to work the way through.I've been more regular these past few days using this product than I've felt in quite some time. I feel lighter and normal.I will post back in a couple weeks to see if there's weight loss, but I'm taking it for regularity because Ex-Lax, Correctol and other products were not working at all. This is working, and working well."
2,doesn't work?,"after seeing reviews for this product before buying, I decided to only use half the recommended dosage because people had said that the dosage was too much. After not experiencing ANY results after day 1 of the colon cleanse, I upped the dosage to the recommended 12 capsules a day. It is now day 3 and I haven't seen any results yet. The reviews said that 12 capsules were too much, but I beg to differ. I will update as I get closer to day 10, but disappointed as of now."
2,OUCH!,"A clunky portrayal of a fine Zane Grey novel. Hollywood really dropped the ball on this one. ""If only"". Red River is the film that this could have been. The whole relationship between the young girl and the buffalo hunter was skimmed over, her story of Indian attacks and her rescue were ignored and the direction became hamfisted. I guess you could say I hated the film, probably intensely disliked it is more accurate."
3,Another journey-and-the adventures-therein story,"In his latest book series, Foster draws upon a trip to Africa for his inspiration. The main character, Etjole, is a ""African"" cattle herder who agrees to a dying man's final wish to continue a quest to save a beautiful visioness from the clutches of an evil sorcerer, who lives far to the north across a continent and an ocean. Being a man of honor and deep conviction, Etjole agrees, and then eats him.The journey and it's adventures ensue.As a huge Foster fan, I couldn't help noticing the similarity(read identical) between his adventures , along with a avaricious companion he acquires, and those of Jon-Tom and Mudge of the Spellsinger series. Out of the frying pan and, well, you know, one after another. I wasn't really disappointed, but just felt a constant sense of deja vu. Good thing I rather enjoy this sort of story as Foster is rather good at it."
3,Need Information about this series of books,I noticed the cover says book one is titled Carnivores of Light and Darkness : Book 2 is entitled In the Pale of Overthinking/Into the Thinking Kingdoms : so what is the title of the 3rd book in the series going to be and when will it be released? let me know at purplehaze_50@hotmail.com
1,"Serious Gamers, Stay Clear!","This gamepad is complete garbage. I bought it for my parents to use on their computer and am totally disappointed with it. My folks like to play lots of console type games on their PC, which is what these gamepads are supposed to be best at. But this controller has buttons that you have press really hard (even the directional pad) in order to ilicit a response. The operation is clunky, but the ergonomics make it feel wonderful in your hands. So if you get to touch one before you buy it (a la Best Buy), you'll be completely fooled by the great feel of it. If you want professional responsiveness from your gamepad, stick with Microsoft's Sidewinder series. Even the most basic Sidewinder is wonderful!"
1,"great design, poor construction","This is the second set of DJP shoes I have owned. I wore these rarely. After a about two years the sole split right from the bottom that touches the ground to the lining inside. You could actually see the liner from under the shoe. Both shoes broke this way, its the spot right after the ball of your foot that gets all the bending. I love the design, but I will never buy a DJP shoe ever again."
5,I'll never have to stand in line at the post office again,"This scale is affordable, accurate and has eliminated all my time in line at the post office. It also doubles as a kitchen scale."
3,"Seems accurate, smaller than expected","Much smaller in size than expected, my mistake I should have paid closer attention to the dimensions. Fairly accurate and finds the same weight repeatedly for the same package. feels kinda cheap, and doesn't appear to be durable. Not particularly sure how to even put a 50lb package on its small scale top."
5,Best book Fern Michaels has written.,"I really enjoyed this book very much. I saw growth in characters, acceptance of situations as they happened and an overall well written story about those who fought an unpopular war and what happened to them after they returned home. The pain of loosing unknown soldiers along with those they knew was well done. Keep up the good work Fern. I am glad to see the sexual scenes take a back stage to the real drama of the story."
3,How could he give up?,"I felt for the most part, that the story was plausible. But I got truly irritated by how long it took for Mac and Casey to finally meet at the end. The fact that Mac gives up on Casey even after Alice gives him the go-ahead to go after her just doesn't wash. I was extremely disappointed that the never get together and presumably live their lives out without each other.I was truly touched however by the comraderie of the troops and the aftermath of the war."
2,Dissapointed....,"I really enjoyed the book and couldn't wait to get to the ending to see what happened with Casey and Mac. I was very dissapointed to read that they never got together. They both wanted to in there hearts, but never did and that made me sad to read. I dont' think I'll be reading this one again, but who knows. I loved the story overall and the love between Mac and Casey before it awery was great!!"
3,Great book if you like sad endings,"The book was just wonderful but the ending was not. However, if you like to feel sad and at loose ends when you finish a book, this book is for you."
3,Christian Adventure,"Fantasy=dragons, wizards, and talking animals, right? Wrong! In The Bark of the Bog Owl, readers are introduced to the country of Corenwald, a land of swamps, gators, and feechiefolk. Aidan, the main character, will appeal to anyone who loves exploring unknown lands, fighting imaginary foes, and getting dirty. It is a rare fantasy book that can interest people who would rather be outside. This is that sort of book."
2,Poor Design,I have two of the 256M version of this drive. On both of them something broke inside the plastic case and now when you pull the drive out of the USB port the case separates from the electronic card inside. Poor design.
5,GREAT,"SO FAR THIS ITEM HAS PERFORMED FLAWLESSLY. I USE IT TO TRANSFER DATA FROM AN XP OPERATING SYSTEM TO A VISTA OS, NO GLITCHES. THE CAP WOULD BE EASY TO LOOSE THOUGH."
5,Excellent update of a CLASSIC pop tune,"The 2004 remixes of Laura Branigan's ""Gloria"" are fantastic! The classic tune from 1982 is given new life for dancefloors of today. The amazingly talented Laura Branigan has left this world but her unmistakeable vocal talent will live on with us forever."
5,Best yet,After using 7.0 for a few weeks I find that this is the best yet. The speed of opening attachments and the compression when making them is fabulous. I highly recommend anyone to upgrade to 7.0.
3,"Decent information, but the writing is less than stellar","I wanted to like this book. It really has decent information that I haven't found anywhere else. However, I found the authors' writing style exceptionally annoying. Nearly every sentence ends in an exclamation point, and the grammar would make an English teacher cry. With each page I turned, I became less interested in the information and more distracted by the writing. The incessant perkiness of the authors is also a big turnoff for men. My husband read two pages and quit.If you can ingore the poor quality of the writing, the book is worth a read for the information."
5,a wonderful & fantastic book!,"i received this book as a gift & i couldn't put it down! i would highly recommend this book for anyone who is trying to have a baby ..... truly a fantastic book! it offers ideas on eating, having fun, relaxing & much much more!"
3,not my favorite,"I bought and read a bunch of books during the pre-conception phase. I have a bit of buyer's remorse for this book. Much of the information presented is in every other book out there, with the exception that the other books each have something different to set them apart. Either this one doesn't, or I was just too bored to get to that part."
3,The best part is the art and the chirp,"My husband bought this book for our daughter. He was in a bookstore, leafing through the book: it took him a while to figure out where the chirping was coming from! While she likes the pictures, the text is a little too long for a child her age (she is now 12-14 months). But when we get to the chirping, she always says, ""peep-peep-peep-peep-peep!"""
4,"Sweet Story, Beautifully Illustrated","My two year old son loves The Very Quiet Cricket; and this book, along with ""Brown Bear, Brown Bear..."", have been his bedtime favorites for months. Toddlers and parents alike will enjoy the repetitive and rhythmic nature of the verse (my son heaves a very dramatic sigh every time I read ""...but nothing happened, not a sound."" The simplicity of the tale lends itself nicely to parental embellishment, which is great for those who like to add a bit of their own drama to a story. I love the fact that I can tailor my reading of it to suit the hour or my son's mood, making it shorter or longer, exciting or soothing. Eric Carle's illustrations alone make this book a worthy addition to any child's library.I agree with the reviewer who complained that this is not ""first reader"" material, but I would add that ""The Very Quiet Cricket"" is more about the joy of reading than about teaching the mechanics of sounding out simple words."
5,A definite favorite,"This is probably one of my son's favorite Eric Carle books. The repetitive text can be a trifle annoying until you realize it encourages your child to ""read along"" with you, which is great."
3,"Great great story, if only the ""chirper"" lasted!","This is one of my favorite of all Eric Carle books, right up there with the classic The Very Hungry Caterpillar. I love the repetition, the introduction to different insects, the quiet of watching the Luna moth, and the subtle ""keep trying"" message of the little cricket trying to make a sound.HOWEVER, after buying YET ANOTHER hard cover copy, and even keeping it as a ""teacher only"" book in my preschool classroom (something I dislike in theory), I am tired of the surprise at the end not working for long. This last copy was read less than a dozen times, only onthe hands of an adult, and the chirper no longer works. I think I am done buying this book."
4,Great for my camper and home,"It works well. Very large cooking surface. I like that it can fold down a bit. I would like it better if there was a way to store the cord with the griddle somehow. I use in my camper and it's a perfect fit on the stove! I like it so much, I use in the house as well."
2,Beware of uneven cooking,"From the first start, this griddle suffered from uneven cooking...curious if element is just bad since not everyone had the same issue."
3,More Background Needed on Main Character,"Cauffiel tries to apply the formula for true crime writing that works so well for Ann Rule. Rule explores the characters' lives and unfolds the crime gradually to the reader.Cauffiel spends a lot of time meandering around following the erratic behavior of a drugged pimp trying to show his background and motivation. Unfortunately with this account, it jumps rather aimlessly from the psychologist to the hooker to the pimp to the wife and through a misc. batch of police and street people. It ends up being confusing rather than coherently setting the scene and climate for a murder.Even after reading the whole book, it was hard to see why the psychologist so quickly fixated on the young streetwalker, spending thousands of dollars indulging her, to the point of endangering his practice and marriage.I think a little more detail on the victim's childhood, and his parents' behavior would have clarified this."
2,Not a great page turner,"Reese was friends with a guy named James, who gets murdered. Reese then went on a drinking binge after his death.When he returned home, to Bonne Chance, he found out he was now the guardian of Patience, the daughter of his friend James.Patience don't aprove of him (Reese) being a slave owner.Well to make it short, they get married, blah, blah, blah.Just didn't enjoy the book, took me a very long time to read it."
2,"Funny, but uninformative","When looking at the description of this title, I assumed that the book would be much more informative on pregnancy symptoms (it seemed relatively few were mentioned, mostly headaches and the like as experienced by the author), and assumed a larger ""question and answer"" section on pregnancy. That said, it's not a bad book, just not what I feel it was presented to be by the synopsis. This is more suited for entertainment purposes than any significant ""educational"" value."
1,Save your money,I bought this book with the hopes that it would include detailed drawing on a variety of mantels. nope. It is more of a large sales brochure with designs you can't build yourself and in reality if your going to buy one ready made then the company with send you a free brochure with more mantle designs than are in this silly little book.
4,Doesn't work with another brands,"Isn't a problem with the covers, they work fine with Wilson products. But doesn't fit very well in another brands"
2,Wilson Iron Covers,The listing didn't advise they were 'oversized' so don't fit my irons. Sizes among set were inconsistent. Cost as much to return so not worth it.
5,It's the Cheese,"I happened upon this CD by mistake for free. Yes, I too enjoy a toothpaste sandwich while bathing in rotten octopus paste every once and awhile, but to me the Cheese is much more satisfying. My favorite track: Harmony. My least favorite ""Careful and Moonshine"". I really don't understand what I like about it so much except it is perfect, generic, relentlessly unspontaneous rock. I have to have it every once and awhile."
2,Good sound but extremely cheap and uncomfortible.,This was a very bad buy for me. I should have listened to the guy that wrote above me. Good sound but extremely uncomfortable and cheap. Save your money on this one. Believe me.
4,No bad at all.,They look big and bulky and but fit my head just fine. The only 2 things I had a problem with is you can't turn the volume up very loud (although I must say that it is loud enough for listening to music unless it was recorded at a low volume) and if you wear them much more than about 2 hours they start hurting your ears. Each side was adjustable so I had no problem getting them to fit my head comfortably. Not sure about the microphone because I haven't had a use for it yet but I would reccommed these to amyone.
5,"If you are interested in GPS, this is the book for you!","What I liked most about this book was that it was so readable. As a non-technical person who was interested in learning more about how GPS works, I found this to be the perfect book. The author does a great job of writing for the layman. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in GPS."
5,Black Comedy at its Best,"I fell for this novel, excuse the pun. Hornby has a way of being comic and tragic at the same time. His characters come alive on the page, and the story is so engrossing, it's hard to put the book down for longer than ten minutes at a time. If you like comic writing, this is a must read. I won't go into plot detail here, because the other reviewers have done that adequately. Highly recommend!"
2,Strange book,"This is a very strange book. I read it for a book club we and all agreed it's very strange and depressing. The story line was easy to follow, just an odd subject. I don't want to mention too many details to ruin the book in case you want to read it; I was thankful though that it didn't have a fairy tale ending."
3,Didn't Get It,"I love Nick Hornby, but for some reason I didn't get the humor or reason for this book. I had a hard time finding suicide or people contemplating suicide to be funny.I gave it 3 stars because you still see the great writing style and abilities of Hornby, but the story and plot were just unacceptable...to me. I know that some will disagree and find this to be a greatly humurously book, but just not me.I also noticed a lot of use of the ""F"" word. This is common in Hornby's works, but not to this degree.So, I'm a lot disppointed in this book and hope the next Hornby book is more like his usual!"
1,Lacks substance.,"I thought the concept for this story was intriguing. As I read the book, however, I was disappointed in that I didn't feel engaged by the characters, and found them difficult to relate to. While the story line described the reasons for each characters' suicidal ideation, there wasn't enough emotional content to fit the narrative - thus it seemed lacking. Further, I agree w/ one aspect of the review in the Chicago Tribune in that the author doesn't alter his writing style significantly to distinguish between the characters. I read this with a book club of 4 other people, none of whom would recommend the book."
5,Great Audio Book-- A must listen,"This book is wonderful. Made me snort w/ laughter, I can't imagine reading it after listening to the audio book, I really connected to the characters."
3,Clearly opaque,"I found this book to be well thought out, and the dialouge to be intriguing. However, the characters seemed out of touch, and a tad dull. Perhaps that's the point."
2,A Downer by way of disappointment,"Having experienced losing a loved one to depression, I was really looking forward to reading something both humorous and insightful about what drives people to want to end it all...what a disappointment. None of the characters are the least bit likable with the exception of Maureen, who seems to be the only one who has reason to be sad. It's totally unplausible that these annoying people would continue to hang out together, regardless of having that one suicidal thought in common. And the whole angel on the roof and vacation plot points were ridiculous. I would recommend ""How to be Good,"" over this longing for the end of (the book) read anyday."
3,Just OK. A handful of chuckles.,I was hoping for more from the story. It fell short and the characters were pretty thin. Not in the class of High Fidelity or About a Boy. On par with How to Be Good.Quarter of the way through the book I thought I wanted to know how it would turn out for each of the characters. Three-quarters through I didn't care anymore.
2,Too many voices.,"I loved his earlier work, but this one has just too many characters woven together and too many voices. Couldnt get traction with it."
3,A Long Way Down,This book was enjoyable. I was eager to finish and invested in the characters throughout the book. I enjoyed it's setting being in London. It was quirky and made me laugh several times.
3,Typical Hornby Twits,"For some reason I can't quite explain Nick Hornby is my single concession to reading novels written after the 1950s. He's clever, amusing, and careful enough that the apparent modern-day absence of editors doesn't pose a problem. ""A Long Way Down"" concerns a typically Hornbyesque collection of self-absorbed, extraordinarily philosophical nobodies. One of them, as usual, shares and expounds Hornby's strange obsession with pop music. This book is not on the level of ""High Fidelity"", but for Hornby fans it will do."
5,fun,Great cd for any kid and birthday party. It has a lot of song to play at birthdays so If you wanna have fun this is a good one!
4,Bizkits Bak,"This CD is seeming to be amazing......I went to Summer Sanitarium July 5th in Toronto.....And they Played ""Behind Blue Eyes"" by the who.....ever simnce than ive wanted the cover song....and fell in luv with the old song as well.....yesterday I downloaded the brand new single by Limp Bizkit called ""Eat You Alive"" and it was off the hook....coincidently i d/l ""follow me"" from POD.....and the intros sumhow seem to alike, but its still an amazing song.....I recomment you d/l them both!"
4,Would be 5 stars if it included duet with Britney Spears,Should be a rockin album from Fred and the boys from limp. I just read an article in teen bop magazine that it will be ranked up there with Avril and sum 41. The only disapointing thing is there will be no guest appearence from Britney Spears or even Justin Timberlake. I thought it would be cool if Fred did a duet like he did with Christina Aguilera. Oh well maybe next album...I will keep my fingers crossed.
2,Limp Bizkits next studio album.,"I wouldent expect much from 'Bipolar',the next studio album from Limp Bizkit.Their most recent work,'Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water' and 'New Old Songs' weren't really good,so maybe this will go downhill the same way some of their other albums went.Who knows though,maybe Fred Durst is right and this will suprise everyone,but I highly doubt that it will.I'm not too excited over this album.I don't really like Limp Bizkit anymore so the only way i'll buy this album is if its really,really good and its not as bad as their last two albums that werent really good."
2,Not Bad,"Oh boy, where to start. The theme of this novel is so earnest that one so desperately WANTS to praise it. Who wouldn't like a story where the main protagonists are great looking high school jocks? The overall plot is interesting, if a bit unbelievable. However, the devil's in the details of the telling of the story. The author's exhaustive (and exhausting) use of first person narrative is relentlessly repetitive. If you read this novel, I guarantee you will be skipping long. boring passages of contemplative description. Not to give away any of the story, but the ending is, to put it delicately, a bit of a problem."
2,Does it read SDHC (Secure Disk High Capacity)?,It doesn't say whether it reads SDHC (Secure Disk High Capacity)? Better to be safe: buy one that is ready for SDHC.
4,Good drawer for the money,"If you are considering this product, you should know that a Microsoft ""Natural-Ergonomic"" keyboard will fit almost perfectly. However, in order to reach the back buttons on this keyboard, the drawer cannot be mounted with the wrist pad flush with the edge of the desktop (only about 10 inches of travel). As a result, when closed, the wrist pad still protrudes about 3 inches. This would not be as much of an issue with a standard size keyboard. I purchased this for my wife and she likes it very much. The keyboard tray seems sturdy enough, however the extendable mouse tray seems a little flimsy. If you tend to be a little rough on your equipment, you may want to consider something made of wood or metal. I do think this is a good item for the price."
3,"OK for keyboard, but mouse tray is pretty weak","We bought this drawer for occasional work at home, and that is pretty much intended use. It is not even close to professional equipment that is usually installed in corporate offices. But in case that you need it at home, it works as promised.The keyboard tray is pretty good, it is solid, has wrist pad and locks in place when not used and pushed under the desk. The mouse tray is pretty thin plastic and be gentle or it is going to break.Installation takes about 20 minutes and you need a drill and screwdriver.As it is inexpensive, I would rate is as ""good"".Thanks!"
1,"Junk, Don't wasted money and times..Cheap ""China"" quality& Packing","Just like the title: Cheap, cheap, cheapCheap material, cheap package, missing partJust don't buy this thing, you will wasted your times and moneySave America, Save yourself. Don't buy anything from them ""slave"" China"
4,Very Decent Product For The Money,"This is a very decent product considering the price -- I looked elsewhere at first for this product and Amazon had the best price. Overall, I am very satisfied with my purchase, but I do wish to tell potential customers or even those that have already purchased this product to use #10 half inch sheet metal screws to attach the mounts to the underside of a table/desk that you are adhering this to . . . while a 1/2"" may seem small it is the perfect size if you are attaching this product to a table/desk like Sauder furniture or something of the like from a department store that you have to assemble yourself, otherwise the screws that are provided may be too long as they were in my case."
3,Good,Easy to install with screwdriver drill only and adjustable also. I like the nice fabric pad on the mouse tray.
4,"Nice quality, pretty piece.","Nice quality piece. Though we bought it to use as a spoon rest, we ended displaying it on the counter backboard and buying a bigger spoonrest for functionality."
2,Conversations w/ God Guidebook,We did this as a book study at my church. It brought forth good debate but I do not recommend the series.
1,I didn't like it.,I think this book stunk!!! It didn't tell me anything I didn't know before. I'm just disgraced about this book. Whoever wrote it should be ashamed.
