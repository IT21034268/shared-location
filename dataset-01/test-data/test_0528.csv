1,The jury's in - this wasn't a good read,"I found this book on the bargain table at a bookstore a few months ago. I've found many gems this way from authors I now read regularly. This was definitely an exception.The basic plot sounded pretty interesting, but the execution wasn't very good at all. The momentum is completely lost as the reader gets further into the book. I had no connection to the characters - I really didn't care what happened to them. The entire trial section dragged on and on, made worse by the fact that I didn't care what happened. The conclusion of the whole story was ambiguous (by design, I think) but fell short of being thought provoking.I really didn't like this book at all. I would be even more displeased if I'd paid full price for it."
1,Just another irrelvant abstinence book intended for today's teenagers,"Most teenagers, Catholic or not, will not get into books such as this and the simlar Sex and the Teenager book from the same publisher. The reason is that these moralistic books are irrelevant to the reality that most teenagers have and enjoy a variety of sex acts. This book is unhealthy and irresponsible in its message. Sex is part of all of us. We need to embrace it with commonsense, not see it as something to wait for."
4,RIVAL SLOW COOKER,VERY GOOD BUT WOULD LIKE IT BETTER IF IT HAD VARIABLE TIME AND TEMPERATURE CAPABILITIES.
1,No Longer a Decent Brand,Purchased November 2008 and have used infrequently. Never put in dishwasher. We agree that the low setting cooks too high. The main problem is that the black plastic handle has crystallized and broken away from its nut/bolt fastener of the glass lid. Rival says a handle replacement is $10 plus $5.95 shipping. We will defer that $15.95 to the purchase of another brand. You decide...
1,Returning tomorrow first thing in the morning.,"I stood in the store for twenty minutes debating if I should buy this one or theHamilton Beach 33967 Set 'n Forget 6-Quart Programmable Slow Cooker. At my local store they are both on sale for the same price this week. The Hamilton Beach one looked like a gimmicky product, with to many bells & whistles, so I chose the ""original"" crock pot. After reading the horrible reviews on this crock pot and the great reviews on the Hamilton Beach slow cooker; I am returning this one first thing in the morning. Review after review of people burning food and their fingers is ridiculous. Even the white crock pot has over 100 negative reviews. I cannot wait to exchange this thing!"
1,"Not worth it, falling apart and too hot!","I owned this for about 2 years. After about a year, the handle fell off the lid. Annoying but could work around that by using a hotpad and a fork to lift the lid. It does cook too hot, often burning around the edges. I am back online now trying to find a new crockpot because now the programmable buttons don't work anymore. I push the cook time button and all it does is the red light next to four hours flashes and then the light next to Cook lights up again. Can't get it to cook!"
1,"No good, don't buy","I want my old one back. The handle for the lid broke after about a year. After I bought a new lid for $20, one of the handles on the side of the main unit disintigrated during cooking. Don't buy a rival unity"
3,Not really programmab;e,"In a ""programmable"" product, you would expect to be able to have some variation other than the 4 speed/time selections provided. For example, I would like to be able to start a particular recipe on high for an hour, then switch to low for 4 hours, expecting then that the cooker would switch to Warm. However, to do that you would have to set the pot for 4 hours, then be there to turn it off after one hour, then set it for 6 hours on low, and be there to turn it off after 4 hours. Unless you cooked it the full time on either setting, it would NEVER go to Warm, and you can't manually Warm. I am very disappointed in this product."
4,I love mine!,"My wife and I received this for our wedding 8 years ago. We have used it extensively and so far, we still love it. Nothing has broke, nothing has been replaced, and it still cooks the same today as it did when we first received it. We use our crock pot around 3-4 times a month and some months, more than that, so our crock has seen it's share of use over the past 8 years. The food comes out perfect, hot drinks have come out perfect, and even desserts have been cooked to perfection in our crock. We have never had anything burn nor break. The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because I wish the temp controls were a little better. Sometimes, I need to cook something for 3-4 hours on high and with this model, it can't be done. So that's annoying. Other than that, this has been a great product!"
3,Help! Need the Beef Stew recipe from the booklet!,I also own this crock-pot and so far it has served me well! I am in a bind though...I lost my booklet that comes with it and there was a beef stew recipe I used in there a couple times. My husband is really craving it! If anyone could please post the recipe that would be great! Thank you!
1,"Not a ""slow cooker""","I had been wanting this for some time. I had a Rival Crock Pot for many years, but wanted this larger one with removable crock. I received it as a gift, but it sure doesn't work like my old one. It just boils everything and can't even be turned to a low-enough temperature. DON'T BUY THIS UNLESS YOU JUST WANT AN ELECTRIC POT!"
1,Sould have read the reviews first,I wish I would have read the reviews before buying. I agree with the others who said it cooks too hot even on the low settings. I've used it twice and both times I had it on low and the meal was cooked in 5-6 hours. I'm reading the reviews on the other slow cookers and will purchase a new one soon.
3,complain,im so mad nena its not live and los chicos no lloran there from his regular album i want my refund i bought this album thinking every song its live except those two songs!!!!i have the cassette en its all live whats wrong now about this???songs missing live!!!!
5,Had me laughing out loud which looks funny when your driving in your car!,"This was a terrific audiobook. I truly enjoyed it. The reading by C.J. Critt is outstanding. She is a gifted reader. I loved all of her ""characters"" but Stephanie really had me laughing out loud, especially when she is talking about her stance on pork and pigs and pork products! I also like Mrs. Peas, and heck they are all great. A very charmiing love story, I haven't read any of the Stephanie Plum books so I am not biased as to which is better. This one is just cute! You might love it too."
4,Love Overboard,I enjoyed this book but it is typical Of Evonovich. If you like her I think you will like this book.
3,"Janet, the Early Years","This has a ""Harlequin Romance"" vibe that would normally send me screaming in the other direction, but given that it's Janet Evanovich, I was intrigued. I read this in a different way than others might, I think. This was a chance to see Evanovich's writing style in its infancy, before she became the publishing phenomenon that she is today, with the fantastically popular Stephanie Plum novels. The humor is there, but a bit more rough, and the romance is more pronounced than it has since become.Stephanie (see, even that started early on) is in the difficult position of having to be a ship's cook for Ivan, who runs a old-fashioned cruise. You know by the end of page one that these two are going to be together - the fun is in finding out just how that will happen. The resolution is, well, trite. Oh well. It's still Evanovich, and even subpar Evanovich can make you laugh out loud."
1,Great picture book with ZERO strategy,"Cool pictures. Perhaps this would be a good coffee table book. But it is not a STRATEGY book. The maps are unreadable and the ""strategy"" consists of ""when the dragon chases you be prepared to start running"" or ""book it like there's no tomorrow"" during the time trails. My grandmother or even my pet dog could offer better advice. At least they have seen the game..."
2,Not much in here!,"Other than a brief history lesson on the life and times of Crash Bandicoot and some nice artwork there's not much strategy in this book. I agree with the others wholeheartedly, this book is a waste of money unless you just collect strategy guides. It seems to always tell you which levels are hard but does nothing in the way of showing you any help. BradyGames books are usually better than this, I guess this one slipped under the radar. Use the FAQS on the net, they are free and offer WAY more help."
1,Worse than no help - Much of the info is WRONG!,"Not only is this guide oddly unhelpful (telling the reader to ""be careful"" and ""take it slow"" at the difficult or confusing parts, but giving no directions at all on how to get through them), but much of the information it gives is just plain WRONG! It lists incorrect locations for several of the hidden gems, frequently gets the directions for the controls backward (telling you to ""stay left"" where you need to stay to the right, for instance), and simply gives the wrong advice on how to earn rewards (telling you to jump the gap to the red gem, for instance - which will only cause you to die - when in fact you need to shoot it with the bazooka). The run-throughs of several of the levels even put events in the wrong order or leave parts of the levels out entirely so that it is impossible to follow the guide. You will do your game more harm than good if you waste your money on this guide."
3,'taste the tears' tastes (and sounds) pretty good!,"this is a winning combination of a great,upbeat Diane Warren song and an amazing voice. the debut single for this up and coming artist holds much promise. it's obvious from the first note jason sings that he is not a studio creation...years on broadway are obvious as his voice reaches heights most male vocalists can only look up at. great move by his label to put some snippets from his forthcoming album on the cd single...looking forward to hearing more of ""i'd be lyin'"", as well as the whole cd."
5,"Best bird book out there, bar none",That's all that needs to be said. The hardcover is luscious. The new softcover is great - get them both.
5,Help for saying the Rosary,Great book for someone who is trying to learn how to pray the rosary. This book will guide the user on how to meditate while praying.
4,Finding Herself,"I really enjoyed this book about a 30 something year old woman coming to terms with the loss of her mother, bad relationships and the resultant poor choices she made in the name of love and acceptance.Jones has written a highly accessible, easy read that is worth curling up with on a long and lazy weekend."
2,Not Really Seductive From The Sour Milkshake,"Sometimes there is a song that can actually gear to grab you, but not nearly as close as you'd like. That really came from the case of Kelis. Her popularity really proclaimed her as a one hit wonder during the late 90's. She had a album released overseas, but doesn't really have the star power she needs to have. Her latest single, Milkshake, isn't really a catchy track outside of the beat. It does seem alright at first, but not really a must have. I really suggest this one, only if you have a die hard taste for Hip Hop, but not if your not into this kind of song at all. It is just one of the rauchiest songs of the year, and just doesn't appeal very well to me."
4,Kelis - Milkshake,"Don't have the CDsingle - yet, but want it. This song is awesome. The music is messed up - it's to hip hop as Aphex Twin and Squarepusher are to electronica - it breaks new ground. Off kilter, somewhat disonant and disjointed, but all the more interesting and intriguing because of it. Granted it is lyrically softer and less poignant that ""Caught Out There"" or ""Young Fresh and New,"" but musically it ranks up there with those amazing trax!"
4,She Brought Me To The Yard!,"This is one of my favorite songs of 2003. The song is kinda weird at first, but soon the catchy beats and funny lyrics grab ahold of you. Although radio overplayed it a bit, this song still is extremely catchy. I had the opportunity to see the shake in real life, and let me tell you: it was good! But this single will have to do for all of you who haven't see Kelis in person. The remixes are okay, not the best I've heard. But they are still pretty catchy! ENJOY!!!"
2,Trade Empire,"A wonderful concept, but demands too much detail management. Very confusing to manage, and I believe that this game was not beta tested very thoroughly. Don't buy it."
3,buen cantante,En este album se algo verde y no lo veo nada parecido a lo que es ahora en este album se ve como un chaval como de 22 años y hasta en sus videos se ve así no se como ha cambiado pero se ve que en ese tiempo era de estar con mas chavas y se veía un joven atractivo y tenía otra voz su video que más me gusta de ese album es Pisando fuerte por que sale con una chava tirandose agua con una pistolita de esas para peinarse y sale también en un jacuzzi y el escenario se ve como con muchas luces aunque el de los dos cogidos de la mano también se ve bueno el video por que Alejandro sale cantando en una banda y la chava que sale parece una muñequita.
2,I finally got it to work,I purchased this to work with a Sanus Wall mount. I wanted to connect a Panasonic sound bar to the wall mount. This is the only thing that would work with the wall mount I purchased. It was not a good fit. The mount is designed for a small center speaker and It wouldn't reach the mounting holes on the sound bar. I called the company and tried to purchase some extra parts to make it work. They were no help at all. They wanted me to buy a different tv mount and use another model speaker mount. I had to go to the hardware store and purchase a steel bar and some brackets to extend the reach of the mount. It looks OK now and works fine but I had to remake a lot of the supports. I lost about $60 getting this to work. Still it was much less than going with the other mount and speaker mount.Sanus Customer service was not helpful at all.Be sure it fits your equipment before buying.
1,Paper weight,"I made the mistake of getting about 5 cheap power tools made in China. I havn't thrown them away, but I do not use them. They are loaners, and I use my American, Japanese, and German tools myself. Generally, they are not worth the price of shipping."
4,If you own an 80's Fender Lead II Guitar....,"and you need new frets, these are the frets for you. They are pre radiused to 7.25"" and are the thin wire that comes on the 79-82 Fender Lead Series guitars. I imaging they work on any guitar that has the 7.25"" neck radius."
5,What a ride!,"Despite the warnings from people who told me that the book was too realistic to be enjoyable, I enjoyed it a lot. It was fast-paced with a good amount of detail and a cool ending. I researched a bit about Y2K after reading it and found tons of articles supporting this scenario. One thing's for sure, this is WAY better than all the boring nonfiction on the subject."
4,"Good product, low price","First of all, it arrived at my house in less than a week, so that was great. For the price, it's not a bad quality product. Similar products I've seen has cost $200 or more. It also serves it's purpose well as a room divider. I'm able to split off my living room from a not so attractive piece of furniture. I would definitely recommend this product to others."
4,nice addition,I really like this divider. It came on time and is what I expected it to be. It sits right in the corner of my room and looks awesome
4,Pretty and lightweight,"In the most basic sense, this is perfect: it looks like the picture and does what it's supposed to. The hinges bend easily, it was easy to put in place, it's quite lovely and unobtrusive, and thank god I didn't have to do any assembly. So. What the product description says? It's true! It's a quite nice dividing screen.It's easy to scratch the wood when cutting the tape on the box, because there's no protective paper or foam in there to separate the screen from the tape you're cutting through. Easy to avoid once you know it's an issue, but be aware. It's also a lot lighter than I expected, which is good and bad. Good: very easy to move around, both for bending pieces and to haul the whole thing someplace. Bad: easy for the cats to knock over if they jump at it. Good: not heavy enough to do really serious damage when the cats inevitably knock it over.It's a nice screen. I recommend it."
1,look elsewhere,I bought this for $10 at the local pet shop and unfortunately it did absolutely nothing to prevent my kitten from tearing up my couch. I am sending the rest of the unused bottle back to get my money back through their money-back guarantee. My advice is to try another scratch deterrent.
4,Speaking to your heart,"Speaking to Miranda opens a door to a world that I never knew existed. It is a heart wrenching novel about love and lost truths. Love, murder and deceat makes this tale of Ruby and Miranda's friendship come to life in a riverting and unexpected light. A must read."
4,The Swim Coaching Bible (The Coaching Bible Series),"I use this book to coach my kids swimming.It is a very detail book with lots of drills and explanation.The reason I give it 4 stars is that if they can add some real photo for stroke anatomy, it would be great."
5,Enter the world of vampirerisme,"This book amazes me , never have i read a book so fast and so intense. Rice and Stoker are buddng besides this."
2,"Not bad, but not my cup of... er, blood","I am split right down the middle on Barbara Hambly's Those Who Hunt the Night.On one hand, it's nice to read a vampire novel that doesn't focus on how vampires are tortured, brooding creatures that also happen to be Pure Sexiness to anyone who encounters them. Hambly's vampires are predators, who survive through hunting and killing. Any allure the vampires have, any grace, all their powers are only there to help them hunt and kill. These creatures are scary.But on the other hand, despite an interesting if not particularly imaginative murder mystery, Hambly is a boring writer. I found myself rereading passage after passage, simply because I couldn't make the words connect to my brain. (See also: another vampire novel, The Historian) While I appreciated what Hambly was trying to do here, her execution lost me."
3,OK but still out there,"Mack is a good writer and has noteworthy credentials. I've read a lot of alien related books and several of his case studies are definitely out there. Hybrid stories and other details corroborate with each other but each abductee seems to be the chosen one, even among other witnessed abductees on ships and everything. There's very little modesty, which is a tad hard to believe at times.I had my own experience(s) and matched it with the insights in the book. However, I had to skim read several outrageous and ridiculous stories offered in the book. Also, I don't like the author's use of quotes. He talks as the narrator but includes first person quotes that, to me, are unorthodox. It's a small gripe though. Good book if you're into this subject. If you're looking for a first book on the subject, read Strieber or Hopkins first."
3,Interesting documentation of a phenomenon,"This book is worthy of our consideration because of its psychological approach. He is not a paranormal investigator a la Hopkins or Vallee, but is presenting case studies of individuals who, irregardless of our opinions of the circumstances which underly their views, have definite symptoms of emotional distress relating to the perception of communication with mysterious entities. This book documents the claims and experiences of the ""abductees"" and allows for the reader to interpret the information for himself. I definitely believe that the abduction experiences are completely authentic, but I definitely do NOT believe that Dr. Mack's conclusion concerning interplanetary contact with highly advanced alien civilizations is the cause of these experiences. Interesting book."
2,"fails to be American, lacks diverse voices","After the 1997 collection, this one falls flat. A warning to women - male poets have you 2 1/2 to one in this series. With some exceptions, there is excessive intellectualism that fails to move; this is a glaring example of some of the ironies of poetry today (too emotional, honest = not good; too far reaching, nearly nonsensical = good). The poetry community should not wonder why it fails to reach a larger audience. The intelligent reader is there if the message is accessible. Poetry is a delight in its many incarnations; I only hope that the next one chooses more diversity, more voices, is more American in its soul."
3,Too many printing errors,"This book is well written. It is really good that the publisher ventured to publish a textbook of this rather rarely studied language of western India. Unfortunately it is indeed full of printing errors (roughly on every other page!). This is rather bad since those errors occur mostly in the Gujarati passages. Most often, the examples in Gujarati script are transcribed incorrectly or vice versa (only the transcription giving the correct form). Those who do not want to learn the script will thus often learn incorrect forms and those who are trying to learn it will have doubts whether it is an error or they misunderstood something. In a textbook designed for self-study it may create a lot of problems. Otherwise the book would be very good and certainly the best one to start learning everyday Gujarati."
4,A wonderful first novel,"Pattison paints an achingly beautiful portrait of modern-day Tibet and creates deeply felt characters the reader can believe in and feel for. It takes a good writer to show the evolution of a character, and Pattison manages to do so with more than one. The story traces a murder investigation involving a political prisoner and his keepers, with an interesting twist on the investigator. Although the ending was a bit pat, I won't spoil it by explaining why I felt it perversely cheated fate. Nonetheless, any writer would be proud to call this his first novel. I will be interested to see how he follows it up."
3,Shan Survives,"I found this to be a readable book and kinda revealing about Tibetan religion. I didn't know Buddhists were so materialistic and dependent on magic. The story of course supports the general belief that the Chinese are the bad guys for busting up the religion in Tibet but gives voice to Chinese opinions that the religion has sucked up the little resources available and sunk it into solid gold statues of Buddha for instance. Its rather interesting that both sides' opinions are written about. and then in the middle is the gullible foolish American. However, Shan gets brutally beaten up so many times its hard to believe he can even walk not to mention live and solve mysteries."
5,GREAT PRODUCT,"THIS IS HIGHLY EFFECTIVE AGAINST WORMS! IF GIVEN TO PUPS AT 2,3,4,6,8 AND 10 WEEKS OLD IT PREVENTS WORMS FROM EVEN DEVELOPING! I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO EVERYONE!!"
2,Poor product from a good company,I have other products and screen protectors for other gadgets from this company and they are fine but the Nook protectors do not fit right - I finally gave up and got the standard Barnes and Nobles one which is fine.
2,"Nice looking mill, but flawed design","While the mill itself is of nice design, in a handsome natural cherry, with an ample chamber for pepper grounds, the mechanism that determines the coarseness of the ground pepper is poorly designed. It does not hold it's ""locked"" position in spite of claims to the contrary, and requires frequent readjusting. Knowing this, I would not purchase this item again."
4,Great ... except for the nuts,"Don't give me that gourmet-foodie chocolate crap. (Well, you could.) Hershey remains the best balance of sweet and salty and I return to it again and again. Get over it.(Subracted a star for those stale almonds.)"
5,Beautiful!!!,This is a beautiful tree and very full. The price is unbeatable. I love it.. I am so satisfied. I received it in only 3 days! I was expecting it to take at least a week. Now that's great service.
4,"Classic, simple, elegant.","Classic, simple, and elegant. Great for work, versatile in its simplicity. Nice little piece to have. I also got matching earrings. Good deal."
5,Excellent Item,"Ordered for our youngest granddaughter. She is delighted. She wants to watch Casperevery time she comes over, which is frequently. We are pleasantly surprised as thisis our first time to order anything here. Thanks, greatly!"
3,wonderful television show but...,"I love this television show. It's release on DVD made me very happy. I watched this show when it was originally broadcasted on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) television station in Toronto. It is a classic and it's DVD release was long overdue. I am a little disappointed though. The transfer is not of good quality. There are scratches and hair particlesin frame. I probably could have gotten a better quality picture if I had taped it off TV myself. The Boston public tv station WGBH who released the DVD should have put more effort into its picture quality. Also, I understand that this is not the complete original show. It is the version that was aired in America on public tv, which was edited and sanitized for American consumption. The original Canadian version was perfect. It should not have been tampered with. It is still a very worthwhile addition to my DVD collection and I think that you will enjoy it too."
4,Works as described,It works as described for an inexpensive plumb bob. The string that it came with has a tendency to untwist itself and then tangle up once tension is taken off the string so that was annoying but otherwise it works great.
1,"If I could give a rating of zero stars, I would.","This album should be given away for a free gift when someone purchases a real CD. The concept of singing ""gangsta"" rap, is just plain dumb. I'm glad that TQ wrote all 18 songs on this album because it would have been a shame to have paid someone to write this bullsh#t."
5,A must have,"Okay people dont even bother reading the 1-3 star reviews. This is a must have for r&b fans.Track by track review1. Intro2. Westside - 4/5 - played to death, but still good3. If the world was mine - 3/54. Paradise - 3/55. They never saw me coming - 3.5/56. Interlude7. Gotta make that money - 10/58. I get around - 5/59. Remembermelinda - 3.5/510. One more lick - 10/511. Interlude12. Darlin mary - 4/513. When i get out - 10/514. Interlude15. Your sister - 10000000/5 Best damn song ever16. Bye bye baby - 4/5 - also played to death but still good17. The comeback - 10/518. Better days - 3/5The best tracks that you cannot live without in your R&B Music collection are:- Gotta make that money- One more lick- When i get out- Your sister- The comeback"
3,Nice product...not wireless,"I was really happy when I received this, it was really nice looking & good quality, the only dissapointment was that it was not wireless. My boyfriend liked it a lot but never uses it b/c it's wired. I wish I noticed that before purchasing."
3,very good service,"hiDear sir,the services of Amazon is very excellentthe textbook is useful for learners and teachers but the fonts are very small ,it is difficult to readthank youwith best regards"
3,An interesting viewpoint marred by bias,"While Stevenson paints a picture of the troubles nicely with interesting facts and vivid personal accounts, he also retains an extremely biased viewpoint within the work. He repeatedly criticizes the Republican viewpoint and officials, calling them trite, cruel, narrow-minded and flawed, while he praises the Unionists for being practical, rational and righteous, as if their side of the argument was the only one with basis in fact."
3,Interesting,"Interesting disc for Tony Joe White fans. His earlier discs are better - such as On The Path Of A Decent Groove, Lake Placid Blues, Closer To The Truth and One Hot July. Easy to listen to but some of the tracks are badly recorded."
5,Tribute To Tasha Yar!,"This book offers a glimpse into the brief life of the Enterprise's late security chief Tasha Yar. We barely got to know her on the television show, now you can read all about the events which made Yar the strong woman she was. Because this book was written early into the series, the characters may act diffrently then what your used to. But do yourself a favor and read this gem. Be warned though, the ending may bring you to tears. Keep that box of tissues handy"
2,Doesn't sych per the instructions...so basically useless,"If you buy the headset only (without the base), it must be synched to the base you use it with. My original one that came with the base fell apart in my hands one morning after 4 years of daily use. I thought I'd save money buying just the headset part I needed since the base I had was working fine. Couldn't get the replacement headset to synch at all to the base -- tried a variety of ways to get it to work and multiple attempts. The directions were pretty precise so not much room for misinterpretation. Just didn't synch -- so basically, these were useless new headset replacements. Ended up buying the whole unit (headset/base) and only got to keep my original lifter functioning without replacement. Good to go now. Don't waste your money - just buy the base and headset ""combo"" when you need to replace either one."
2,Is this it?,"The sheets for droids, starships and vehicles are nice, but 10 copies of the SAME character sheet?! C'mon!! Why do we need multiple copies if permission is given to photocopy? I think WotC could have spent a little more time on this and produced a separate character sheet for each class (like with D&D 3E)."
1,character classes???,"Yeah, the sheets allowed me to not have to try to copy the page out of the core rulebook, but how about some variation with sheets made specifically for each character class. At about a dollar a page, that's pretty stiff just for copies. The vehicle/starship sheets are nice, but certainly not worth the money."
3,Una voce solamente bella,"I've listened to this album a number of times (in Italian). Certainly Laura Pausini has a pretty voice and sings with excellent clarity. However those who might be looking for a powerful, dramatic voice may be disappointed. In particular the music on this album seems to me very ordinary and 100% derived from American 1980's pop, with not much variety from one song to another. Finally, I was disappointed that the album has only 8 songs and is just 33 minutes long."
1,Very much in need of an update,"I used another book by Singer for our trip to St. John (USVI) the previous year so I was expecting something as useful and informative as that when I dropped the money on this book. Very disappointing. Everything that the St. John book was, this book on Vieques was not. I suggest you pass on this one."
4,"Fantastic, Mysterious, and Thoughtful, but not Fantastical","Quite different than most of the books in the O'Keefe-Murray realm... But intriguing none theless.A great mystery, and something that I couldn't put down.It's geared towards younger readers, but I still appreciated it alot.There's some beautiful wording in there, that only L'Engle can manage."
3,Disappointing - not one of L'Engle's best,"Despite the high hopes I had when I started this book (due to my high regard of L'Engles other books - A Wrinkle in Time, A Wind in the Door, etc), I was sorely disappointed in this book. THe plot was a little above average, but it just didn't hold my attention. Additionally, L'Engles attempts to write in Southern dialect for the main character's dialogue failed miserably and came off ""hokey"" and unrealistic."
5,IN LOVE,"Madeline L'Engle does it again, love this book. she just writes pure magic. Its for any age I think. she just has way about her writing that makes you unable to put the book down until you have finished it."
4,"Ahhh, another!","Yet another story full of characters interlaced from past to present, through time and trial, familiar names and people drawn together in a wonderful tale of human actions and relative consequences."
3,"""A"" for creativity","strangely, i didn't think this cd was all that until i read the liner notes - THEN it made sense. fun CD - can't listen to it non-stop (especially that darned dog song), but the other ones are pretty fun. good for long drives - lots of variation."
3,Freddy the Pig meets Santa Claus,"This is the second of the Freddy the Pig books written by Walter R. Brooks. The earlier books, while terrific for children, are not as entertaining for adults as the later books. The Freddy books are great moral instruction without ever being preachy, always entertaining. In this book, the Bean farm animals decide to visit the North Pole. They have adventures galore on the way and, at the Pole, help save Santa from some well-meaning pirates who are trying to bring efficiency to Santa's workshop. I didn't rate this book higher only because later Freddy books have an even greater appeal. For children, this should be at least a four-star"
1,Flawed design,This has all appearances of being a fine product. However it does not perform because the end of the barrel holding the disk does not screw on enough to keep it together. Every time the trigger is pulled the end of the barrel pops off. It is useless and I have to return it.Steve McKinsey
2,This is SMALL!,"What the description doesn't say is how much this tool will hold. Its inside diameter measures 1-3/4 inches, and the barrel is 6 inches in length. That gives it a capacity of 16.49 cubic inches, or barely 1.14 cups.Also, the plunger does not seal well to the barrel, so if any pressure is applied, there is leakage around the plunger.I like the ratcheting mechanism, though I would have liked to see the shaft be something stronger than U-channel with notches stamped in it. I also like how open the handle workings are, making it easy to keep clean.If this thing was three times the size and had a well-sealed plunger I'd keep it. As it is, though, it's going back..."
3,An interesting book to borrow from the library,"I spent last summer studying in Italy and thought it would be a good idea to purchase this book, and I would also read other books in this series if I was going to go to another country. I found it interesting, although much of the information can also be found in the beginning sections of guidebooks. Basic history and cultural information is included. The book does a nice job explaining the art of dining and drinking in Italy, which most tourists don't realize is quite different than in the United States. It also talks about how Italians act and view life. All of the information is interesting, I wouldn't say that it is a must for anyone traveling to Italy, a good guidebook should tell you the same information. If you are a little nervous about going to Italy and would like to try to be ""in the know"" about the Italian way of life, check the book out of the library and save your money for a gelato."
1,Poor paper quality,"I did not enjoy this book as the puzzles are small making it difficult to put your ""ideas"" in the boxes when needed. The quality of the paper is poor which makes it nearly impossible to erase those occasional mistakes. I would not purchase this book again."
3,"OK, but.................","Started out great but got too ""bogged"" down toward the middle. I think she could have left some parts out. Over all, I would give it three starts for the first part!!"
5,OUTSTANDING!!!,"I really fell in love with this book. No other book has captured my heart since. I loved part one also, but I really ejoyed reading this book from Reesy's perspective. I could feel all of the characters successes as well as failures. Great job Ms. Files. Thanks for the great read. :-)"
4,"Close the door, block out the world Misty and Reesy are Back","I recently finished reading Getting To The Good Part and it left me with many mixed emotions. I laughed, I cried (the wedding toast) I got really ticked (don't try to blackmail Ms. Reesy). I started reading this book at 7 pm and was unable to put it down until completion (12 a.m.) As a Floridian I am extremely proud of our hometown girl (Lolita Files) For those of you who have read this book you most definately have to read Scenes From A Sista. This will really open your eyes to the beginnings of Ms. Misty and Ms. Reesy.This is a true best friend book. A must for all strong independent (and not so strong/independent) women, black, white, asian, native america, etc...I CANNOT wait to see the rest of their story!!Tasha B."
3,IF YOU WANT FICTION .....,"Reesy seemed more street smart in ""Scenes from a Sistah"" what happended? Reesy was way to ""whorish"". When Reesy was out with Helmut for the first time I suspected that he had put something in her drink the reason she was so out of it that she didn't know him from Dandre in the bed, I was suprised to see that happened to her. This is a fast read, but not realistic enough. AND, Misty was just plan boring."
5,My son loves these.,"My son watches these movies over and over. He continues to enjoy them and more often than not, he is laughing out loud."
2,revu,andrew martin of e-map consumers guide(staff of one) doesn't quite get it. but thats o.k. of course the album is slop...of course the sound quality is horrible...people made alot of money off johnny so he played this joke. ha ha.it's on you.
4,Can't wait to read the next!,"Sometimes I find it hard to get into a fantasy book that is part of a series. I feel like all the author does is try to set up characters and settings. That wasn't the case here. We meet our heroine, Candy Quackenbush of Minnesota, right away and her journey to the islands of Abarat starts quickly. I enjoyed the several stories besides Candy's that were being told at the same time, for I was curious where other characters had gone and what they were up to. I also thought the pictures were great to help me imagine what the creatures Candy met looked like. I really can't wait to the read the next book in the series."
5,Bravo,"Ths book rocked, it was a great stroy that began to unfold and was so up set when i found out the next wasnt coming out for a while ive already read the book 3 or 4 times and the illistarions were so interesting and appropriate to te book"
5,The Best Book in the World,"This book is absoulutly wonderful! It is the best book I have ever read!When it started out it was the type of time I would tend to get bored. But I was abosolutly enraptured!I especially liked Abarat itself, with all of it's islands. It was so different than Harry Potter, and much more intresting too! I find this book was very descriptive, so descriptive you didn't even need the cover to help you. Me being a total fantasy fan, loving books like Inkheart, I think this is a unique book that every fantasy fan should read. This book is the best book in the world!"
4,"Exciting, innovative, creative. Great Pictures!",This was a very enjoyable book to read. The story is about a girl who is unhappy with the life she is living and she is transported to a world called Ararat. Its like a modern day Wizard Of Oz except weirder and more twisted. I think the illustrations are really terrific and they add to the reading of the text.Clive Barker is a great writer and he really gives the feeling that you are right there experiencing all these things! I willl probably want to read the next one in the series. Perhaps I will buy copies of it as gifts for my nieces and nephew who are teens.
1,Skip it.,"Clive Barker paints a picture of an interesting, if disjointed fantasy world - sadly, the story's real world part is even harder to believe. This is not a good book."
5,Abarat! - recognized as a good book,"I do not understand how people can call Abarat ""boring, and not worth it"". It is now one of my favorite books. Clive Barker's world of magic enthralls any true fantasy fan. Obviously this book is worth while because of all the attention it has been receiving. Hello-o-o?!?!?! It was on the New York Best Sellers List! The book also has fabulous illustrations (by Clive Barker) accompanying it's wonderful text. It has a fantastic website, theme-park rides being made after it, and yes! a movie!!! I have on complaint about the Abarat series...it's not coming out quick enough! What more can I say?...just read it!"
5,Sure to be a Fantasy Classic,"This book follows Candy, inhabitant of the most boring town in america, as she journey through the Abarat. She is the daughter of an uncaring mother and a drunkard father. She wishes for something more.Then she meets the interesting John Mischeif. who has multiple heads. He's being chased. With her help they open of the way to the Abarat archipelago. Twenty Five Islands are what it is consisted of. One for each hour of the day. And the mysterious ""Hour Out of Time.""Candy's adventures bring her to meet what will be many intersting friends as well as enemys. This is the first books of the Abarat series written by the master Clive Barker. He also includes illustrations which were oil paintings that he himself created.This book, being written for young adults, can be read by both young as well as old. It is that good! If you want to get in on the next best thing (after this Harry Potter stuff) read this book. The start of an epic classic!"
2,"pretty pictures, lousy book","i picked up this book because of the good photos of the projects. after i started reading it, i found that the sizing on every project is TINY. movie stars and teenage girls may be 36""-busts or smaller, but real women have curves and need larger sizes on sweaters. took the book back to borders and got a refund. thanks to other reviewers here for also pointing out the many errors in the instructions. nothing like spending 80 bucks on yarn only to find that the steps are flawed."
2,Not much worth making,"There is nothing unique in this book--not a single pattern that made me say, ""Wow, I HAVE to make that.""Most of the patterns are the type that are widely available for free on the internet. Basic sweaters and beginner purses, scarves, hats, cell phone holders, etc.I sure wouldn't spend $20 on the book. I got it at the thrift store for $1.97. I am very concerned after reading the reviews that say that there are many errors in the book. I don't know if I will make any of the patterns just because I don't want the trouble of knitting a pattern with numerous errors."
3,Good Knitting vs Massive Ego,"Ok, in a book titled ""Hollywood Knits"" one should expect some name dropping. Unfortunately, Suss seems to believe that she invented knitting (or at least the basic steps, as they're all labeled ""Suss step 1, Suss step 2"") and is soley responsible for the recent handknitting craze by knitting Bill Cosby's sweaters in the late 1980s.On the other hand, if you can get beyond all that, these patterns are easy to do, but very cool (especially the orange turtleneck she designed for Velma in the live-action Scooby Doo movie). The only pattern complaint is that the largest size is a 36"" bust, if that."
5,Delicious curry paste,"This is my favorite curry paste, but many groceries only stock the hot version, which has different spices and a different taste. I am glad I could get this online."
4,Sweet!,"I love this set, my mom and aunt decorated my nursery for me, I was not allowed to see it until the day of my shower and I absolutly love the set! My baby loves to talk to her bears and it's perfect if you have a girl or boy! The only thing is that the ties on the bumpers can tear off easily if you tie them too tight, but otherwise the material is quite sturdy."
4,Good quality light bulbs.... but...,"Received the shipment and all the bulbs are working. One thing I noticed though, Amazon has increased the price from 14.99 to 20.99. It is interesting to see such a fluctuation in price in such a short time (it has been less than a month)."
2,Not long-lived,"I bought a case of 12 of these about a year ago because we have 8 can lights in the kitchen and four of the previous Verilux bulbs all seemed to need replacing at once. Well, we have gone through eleven of these in one year! We replaced those four Verilux right away, and then over the next year replaced the four other Verilux and three of these Sylvanias. I came down this morning (it's a grey day here in Seattle) and when I turned on the light the kitchen looked kind of gloomy. Three more Sylvanias have burned out! And it was February of 2010 when I bought them. This is not what I consider a good life for a light bulb (bulbs we put in our pendant lamps in 2007 are still going strong) so I'm on the hunt for a different bulb."
5,Bargain price for good bulbs,"I have a large number of recessed fixtures in my home that require this type of bulb. I had been using Philips Halogena bulbs from Home Depot. I've always tried to use the same bulbs to avoid problems with varying brightness due to varying standards among bulbs and manufacturers. I've always cringed when I need to re-supply because they are always so expensive at the store. When I saw these on Amazon at a relatively low price I was skeptical. They are the same brightness and color as the other bulbs in my home.I can't speak to longevity because I haven't had them installed long enough to know. I hate the CFL equivalent because they are expensive, dim and harsh. Despite claims, they have not lasted long. I plan to buy enough of these to last a lifetime because incandescent bulbs are being phased out due to government mandate.The bulbs came well-packaged and none were broken when I opened the package"
1,My order didnt get here,I wouldnt use this as a review cause didnt get my order so it wouldnt count.. Z z z z z z z z z z z
1,I am cheated!!!,I bought this item according to the description above.All the information I got from the book's page is about learning Dutch.BUT I listened the audio and then I found that this is NOT the material for learning Dutch. All audios are only in English!!! I feel cheated!!! I decide to return this item back.ATTENTION: This is NOT the material for learning Dutch.
2,So called Irish guy Leary knows jack about Ireland,"What I find annoying about Leary's stand-up persona isn't the fact that he so shamelessly rips off the work of the late,great Bill Hicks but his constant use of the term 'Irish Macho Guy' What?I'm Irish and I can say with some certainty that we are not a nation of 'macho guys'.At one point Leary describes his father (an Irish Immigrant) as 'a real World War II-John Wayne-Ted Williams kinda guy'.Ah, excuse me,Denis,but Ireland was neutral during World War II.Do you know what that means?That means the Irish didn't even FIGHT in WWII. Despite this though,there's the odd funny line but,personally,I preferred Leary's 1997 show 'Lock 'N' Load'"
1,Unauthorized Biography,"This book is in no way affiliated with Gene LeBell, and the man goes out of his way to discourage people from buying it or reading it. In his own words this is ""...an illegally printed book, called ""The Toughest Man Alive"" floating around. Please, please, please do not buy, sell, trade, or deal in that book for any reason. If you bought a copy, please go back where your purchased it, and demand a refund. Ask for the only authorized and complete book ""The Godfather of Grappling."""
3,Artifical Sweetner taste,"I'm one of those people who finds most artificial diet sweeteners leave a bad aftertaste. So I was not to choked up with the drink mix taste as it is, but by doctoring it up by adding honey and the refrigerating it became more potable. It does indeed have a raspberry taste to it. It also dissolves well in both warm and cold water."
2,This is NOT for Turkeys. Says so on the box.,"I needed a fish fryer. This looked like a fish fryer, but was labeled a Turkey Fryer. I bought it anyway. This is definitely a small item fryer or a fish fryer. NOT a turkey fryer. It even says right on the box: NOT FOR TURKEYS. So, how is it as a fryer? It does the trick. Nothing special. The instructions are very confusing and difficult to follow. They are for two different fryers. The metal ring at the bottom that came with my fryer must be for the other model. The holes to screw it in would not align. Since I needed this item for a party, I used it anyway and just put the ring inside for support of the legs. If I had bought this locally, I would have returned it for those reasons."
3,This is NOT a turkey fryer REPEAT this is NOT a turkey fryer,"I bought this as an outdoor deep fryer that I expected to later be able to use as a turkey fryer. Based on the product description you would think it was but when I received the product in big bold letters it stated ""THIS IS NOT FOR FRYING TURKEYS"" because I needed it for a party I was forced to use it or else I would have returned it. It seems like a nice solid outdoor NOT TURKEY fryer."
1,Good and bad,"First of all: Kudos for making a big movie on a small budget. That's something to admire.But, - I found the film very, very boring. None of the characters managed to become more than cardboard figures representing some cliché archetypical movie character.No doubt the true stories the film is based on are extremely interesting and impressive on their own, but that never makes it into this movie. It all falls apart bevcause of onedimensional acting, shoddy directing and, well, bloodless plot. There are no hooks.I watched the whole thing with director/producer's commentary afterwards, and the banality of their thinking shocked me.More than once my girlfriend and I burst out laughing from the Hallmark card philosophy and the team's blindness to the film's obvious faults.Sorry - good try, but doesn't really cut it."
3,Saints and Soldiers - Fair,"This film's strength was the photography, extremely well done for the level of budget. The costumes and vehicles etc. were also surprisingly good. The movie never reminds you of it's cost. Where it suffered was in the scripting department.(SPOILERS AHEAD)The four characters, country boy, city boy, grizzled sergeant and British pilot were stereotypical representations. The whole story unfolds with a simplicity of development and morality that belies the awards and some great reviews the film has received here. It reminded me of the some of the war films of the 60's in that regard. Whoever produced this movie should be given another chance with a different script, as they have proven that a polished looking movie can be produced on the cheap."
5,An excellent film.,"70+ years later, a film like this speaks to the sacrifices an entire generation made. So costly the sacrifice.This film was well made, on a very tiny budget in comparison to today's blockbuster movies. And arguably was more engrossing than most movies I've seen in years.Well done all around, the acting was great, the casting and writing made the movie real."
1,Canciones equivocadas?,"Quiero comprar este trabajo en la tienda de Amazon y la canción un VEstido y un Amor no es la que corresponde a este trabajo, (en la opción de preview) La versión que sale es la de Euforia... es terrible que nos eten metiendo canciones que no corresponden al comprar los MP3."
3,Not the long- awaited biography but a good book for the fans,"i was waiting for a biography signed by ""the best there is, the best there was and the best there ever will be"", this book is more a tribute of the majestuous carreer of the best wrestler of all time. It's good writing, it's interesting, good book but not the awaited..."
3,I was going to get this book but after the reviews,Bret Hart is and was and will always be my favorite wrestler but after I read all the reviews I will not be purchasing this book. Thanks for all the honest reviews.
4,very cleaver film,"i finally got to see this film recently and enjoyed it from start to finish. the Humor at first was a trip and then the film got real dark and serious.the Main character was coming back home and he wanted to still be down with his roots and he was being tested. his wife represented the new world he had undertaken and his family and old running buddies didn't know if he had changed or if he was still down. he was working a auto plant and they wanted to see if the big city life had changed him from his past ways. this film was the one that got the Godfather and other classics off and running. Giada De laurentis of the Food Channel who has a show called Everyday Italian,well her Grandfather Dino De Laurentis Produced this film.this is a must see film."
5,Wife Loves Them!,My wife loves the knives. Best knives she's ever had. Her only comment was that the big knife is not the same big knife that Rachael Ray uses on her show. It's a smaller version of the same knife.
5,Olay touch of sun,"this product not only give your a little color, it is good for your skin, really see a different on my face, love this product. :)"
1,horrible,Too many blemishes pop up on my face and when applying the cream becomes flaky.Looks like foundation applied incorrectly
3,No noticeable difference,It's a good moisturizer but not any better than other products that I have used.
2,odd smell and was very oily,"The product sent had a generic label, they said due to high demand they ran out! The product had a odd smell and was very oily. I tossed it out. Do not waste your money. I threw it away as I could not return it."
4,good daily moisturizer,I've used this product for years. It's a good daily moisturizer. I have combination skin and I never break out with it. I also have rosacea and it has no acids and actually has vitamins that are good for rosacea. It has sunscreen that doesn't irritate as well. I'd recommend this for anyone with combination or even oily skin.
4,Excellent product so far ...,"I bought this product because in my country is not marketed. I am happy so far with the presentation and texture of the cream. Can use under make-up without problem.Recommend it widely, especially for women in their thirties!"
2,BEaware! Not good for sensitive skin......!!!,"To begin, I have Combination oily/dry skin & I am 19 years old I do Not have acne but I will get the occasion pimple or two. My skin is sensitive.....This moisturizer smells amazing. When I put it on my skin it felt so smooth and even. It does make your skin oily.. && after putting it on,, In a few hours pimples started appearing on my cheeks and face!!! i NEVER had pimples on cheeks before!!) I discontinued use of product. It is NOT GOOD FOR SENSITIVE SKIN! i am RETURNING THIS PRODUCT!"
1,Don't waste your money.,"We got them to work.... up to a total of 8 feet away. Beyond that they don't receive the message from the other unit, even when they're in the same room."
3,Better in theory than in practice,"Cons:- Flimsy construction- Produces a noticeable ozone smell (ozone is toxic)- Leaks water- Takes longer than I thought (about 20 minutes) to complete the recommended cleaning cycle for produce like spinach, apples and strawberriesPros:- That ozone smell gives me confidence it's working ;)A single (thoroughly miserable) bout of food poisoning that hospitalized me was enough to sell me on this product. I continue to use this it in spite of its cons, because it seems to be the only product of its type available and I have access to a well ventilated area where it can run away from my family. I've seen other reviews that mention damage to produce, but I haven't experienced that. Overall, I wish that another company would manufacture a higher quality product with a better seal and better ozone deactivation."
1,UL and EPA approval?,"I first saw this product several years ago. At that time, the unit emitted quite a bit of ozone into the atmosphere and could not pass UL certification. Does the current unit for sale have UL approval, and if so, what safety features have been added to enable this? Last but not least, the amount of ozone transfer was pretty low on this machine back then and I believe the process took over 20 minutes. Is this still the case and have you registered the product with the EPA to be able to claim purification? I have given it a single star and will gladly change this once I know this product has been tested and approved."
4,feels like a movie,this game is done well. the graphics are good and the game play is refreshing.it draws you into the story. a little hard to play but enjoyable when you solve a section.
2,PC Gamer gave this 93%!?!?!!?!,"Man, was I duped into buying this. PC Gamer made it editor's choice, and gave it a rating that put in on par with Half Life and Doom. But it not ever close. The game looks good, but the gameplay is somewhat lame, and its very difficult to get through the levels without a walkthrough. You rarely get any weapons, and run around with a stun gun for a whole level.This game could have been so much better, but they blew it and most likely relied on a payola scam to get people to say it was good."
4,Women of Primrose Creek Megan,Enjoyed this whole series. All of the women had strength. The men were all strong yet caring. Good substance to each of the stories
4,Great Clock radio,"Great sound and rectption. clock LED is a little bright and a red led would be better, otherwise it is a 5 star radio"
4,good product,"Needed a new radio for the office. The 'used and new' category offered one of these new in box for $104, so I bit, and am glad I did. Everything works as advertised, and the selectable-color lighted dial was a nice suprise. The analog tuner performs better than most clock radios, though not as well as the unit's bigger digital brothers (one of which I also own). The CD section works fine so far with commercial and home-burned discs.If I had a complaint, it would be that the long wire FM antenna isn't detachable - It's not needed where I am and is currently rolled up under the unit. From a functional viewpoint, I'd rather have a digital tuner and an analog clock, but that wouldn't look as good - and looks are definitely a big part of the package.This unit works fine and looks good. Noise is low enough it won't drive you (totally) nuts to listen through headphones, and everyone thinks the styling is -very- cool. It is! That's worth $104 any day. Right?"
1,Piece of junk.,"I thought I could trust the Teac brand. I liked the styling. My kids needed a clock radio and like to go to sleep listening to a CD. Bought this unit for Christmas. Within one month, the CD player began to fail. It wouldn't read certain CDs. Store-bought CDs, old or new, when loading a CD it would just spin and spin and ultimately the display would simply read NO. Another month later and it won't play any CDs at all. That's a complete failure of a main feature of the product. Unacceptable. I say AVOID THIS PIECE OF JUNK."
4,Monte Cristo,"Monte Cristo is an old townsite below a sleepy glacial basin located eighty miles northeast of Seattle. It's the destination of thousands of recreational hikers annually. Hidden from their view by a century of harsh winter storms and avalanches is a rich mining and townsite history that Philip Woodhouse brings to life. We returned from a weekend hike so intrigued that we went directly to the public library Monday evening. We found precious little, mostly Washington mining reports and embarrassingly anecdotal histories. This book represents the only comprehensive, readable history of the environs. And it's a wonder to behold. Skillfully woven together are journalistic accounts, anecdotes, recognizable sketches and maps, and a narrative complemented by a generous collection of historical photos. Woodhouse is a writer evidently in love with these mountains and their history. His account is compelling and full of surprises, every bit as enchanting as the townsite it concerns."
3,Licks Licks and More Licks,"Yes, yes, he is a young legend and he is incredible. The CD definately shows some of the best of Jimmy's playing. The one problem about the artist and the CD, is that his playing is incredibly repetitive. If you heard his first CD ""Sinti"" at age thirteen, you already heard it all. A set of ten or twenty jazz guitar lines thrown on every progression. Once you heard him enough and you can point out those licks, the fun is over. That's what happened with this CD. Its time to grow Jimmy boy!"
3,Great concept; needs more entries,"This has become a bathroom book. It's fun to peruse, but if you have something you really want to look up, it tends to not have it..."
2,Not quite enough detail...,"I use these books to host trivia games on a virtual world, where there are a lot of international players. This book has the LEAST detail of dates, history, and actual stories behind the words and phrases of ANY of the books of this type I have run into.I was very disappointed with it."
1,Talk about Cliches,"This is time only the second time I have ever given only one star to a book. I was so disappointed in it. I was expecting more history and substance behing the cliches and expressions, but this book just didn't deliver. I have another book ""New Yawk Tawk"" which gives the source of different NY terms and their meanings. Maybe that is the problem, I was looking for another book like that one.I may be coming down hard on this book for not meeting my expectations, but I honestly would advise people not to waste their money buying it. I am sorry, but I have to be honest."
2,incomplete,"I bought this book because I enjoy knowing about the origins of phrases and the price was right. I should have saved my money as this book, while having some interesting information, never seems to have the phrases that I pull it off the shelf to check. I was disappointed."
2,Fun but not very complete,"Most of the words and phrases in this book are interesting and fun to read about, but I found myself thinking of many common phrases that the book just didn't cover, and there were many phrases in the book that I don't think had been used in about a hundred years."
2,Not current,I should have looked at the date and realized that this would be of use to me now. It is not current. Would have been a great book when it was published.
2,"Good Information, contact lists somewhat outdated, but outlines the biz well.","I found this book to be very helpful for getting a feel for what the child modeling/acting business is all about. Good information, but some of the business contact lists are very outdated. Good handbook for those new to the child entertainment business."
4,I love this book,"Patricia Telesco will always be one of my favorite authors. Her non-pushy attitude and great sense of humour make the book worth the read even if you don't use other people's charms or spells. She's had a wide influence on the young pagan coven community, and this book just reaffirms that she's just as good for a solitary practitioner."
3,My granddaughter hardly ever watch it. She prefer the animated,"She prefer the animated Strawberry shortcake, not the cartoon version. It is more colorful and real. She is 3 1/2 years old."
3,Graphic SF Reader,"Early graphic novel, only so so, but an obviously intriguing team-up. Doctor Doom of course has mystical bits lurking in his origin and background, and this is a meeting of two strong and idiosyncratic egos."
2,"Terrible, Terrible Film","I was unfamiliar with the game Dead Space prior to watching this movie, but I was a fan of Christopher Judge who played Teal'c on Stargate SG-1. I don't see what the fascination is behind making video games into movies, but Dead Space: Aftermath could serve as the only proof that this practice should be stopped altogether.The movie's plot is hard to follow because you don't really know who to root for. None of the characters are particularly likable. You get the general idea of who's a good or bad, but you're never given a reason to care about any of them.The monsters are cool, but I'm sure they can be found in the video game. I don't know if the video game is more fun than the movie, but I'd be shocked if it wasn't.Maybe it's because I'm too old or maybe it's because I'm not into Dead Space, but I hated this movie. It's a waste of time for any member of the human race. I don't say this very often, but I want the time I wasted watching this film back."
2,Not very good. Disappointed,"I am a Dead Space Fan, normally. But, I was very let down and disappointed with this movie DVD. It really didn't stick with the plot of the game and I didn't like the ""look"" of the movie. I really am not impressed with the movies that are being made from games lately."
3,Not as 'good' as the game,"I initially purchased this movie thinking 'Cool, offbeat scifi.' Then I started to watch it and realized it was a cartoon movie based on a video game I'd never heard of.Thankfully I have an 18yo brother. I texted him and sure enough he knew of the game and had played it. He said he'd heard of the movie and was interested in watching it, so I sent it along.After watching it he said it was 'o-k', but not as interesting as the game.I asked how many times he'd played and he said 'once', but for 15hrs straight :)He said someone not familiar with the game could follow the movie, but probably wouldn't 'enjoy' very much.Overall, just a good movie for an 18yo guy."
2,Meandering & uneven entry in Dead Space lore,"If you have thrilled to the adventures of Isaac Clarke in the Dead Space series you will probably be let down by this short feature. It tells the tales of 4 adventurers and what really happened aboard their ship USMG O'Bannon (wink), the CG intro scenes that are intercut throughout the stories are of distractingly low quality, like something out of THE LAWNMOWER MAN. The voice acting and other animation are mostly passable but the story doesn't service anything other than a few shocks, some titillation and quite a bit of profanity that doesn't feel character driven just chucked in for effect. The unitologist characters and some of the gore bits work but not enough to make this a whole. The marker that serves as the cover art and the trailer for the ridiculously better in everyway game (DS2) only make the fact that this is tacked on product stand out all the more. Look away there isn't much to see here."
3,Well... its not bad,"nothing wrong with the movie, it gets to the point. i just did not like the fact that it was just a little over an hour."
1,Shallow delivery system for violence and cussing.,"I'm not really familiar with the video games, and had I known this was based around a video game I wouldn't have selected it from my Vine newsletter.Primarily, video game tie-in movies will invariably suck, and that's just what this did. It is definitely marketed after an M rated game, since its just a bunch of violence, cursing, and the occasional poorly drawn boob.I won't try to summarize the plot (what's the point?) but I can say that the ONLY people this would appeal to are those adolescent males who are in that perfect age where they really want sex and violence in their entertainment, but don't yet understand that sex and violence themselves do not make something good entertainment.All others should stay far far away from this poorly animated, gratuitously disgusting mess of a film."
1,Terrible movie in every way,"This is the absolute worst garbage I've ever seen.1) No real character development2) Terrible animation and CGI quality - think afternoon kids show quality, like Battle Force 5.3) Horrendous writing - no better written than the 'aforementioned afternoon kids show', but with profanity and gore.4) Stupid nowhere to go plot.5) Characters in CGI looked NOTHING like their cartoon animation counterparts.I have played Dead Space and thought that it was good game. I even saw the first Dead Space movie, and although not very good, was still far better than this garbage.It wholly amazes me how anyone could give this movie a good review. It is that bad."
3,"Not quite downfall, but not bad","I will admit, I was slightly disappointed in Aftermath. The plot seemed a little jagged to me and there was hardly any character development during the movie. That being said, there were a few moments where I found myself not feeling buyer's remorse over the film. The animation during flashbacks was very reminiscent of Dead Space Downfall, but bloody heck...whenever I returned to the ""present"" scenario, I couldn't help but think they just rushed it. The CGI seemed like it was from 1997. Regardless, there is plenty of gore and a couple of suspenseful moments. As I have not had the chance to play Dead Space 2, I cannot comment on how it fits with the game."
2,Not for the Non-Player,"Dead Space: Aftermath is the follow up to Deep Space and based on the video game of the same name. The USG O'Bannon has been sent to Aegis VII on a mission to find pieces of an alien artifact. Only four members of the crew make it down to the volcanic surface. The animation is kind of cheesy when compared to all of the CGI we see in today's movies. The movie follows the four survivors individually and we get a 'Rhoshamon' type of story told by each person.When they find the 'artifact' it seems to have a hallucinatory effect on humans and turns dead people into a type of zombie. People who play the video game will enjoy this, but for the rest of us the seesawing between three dimensional present and two-d dreams flashbacks. For me this was just a waste of my time not understanding the back story and not caring about the front story, and the violence is pretty lame and doesn't add anything except to the gore level. So no joy here.Zeb Kantrowitz"
2,Not a fan and not a gamer,I thought that I would give this a try since I'm a sci-fi fan. The overall Dead Space story is interesting and quite good I believe but this video put me to slee on a saturday afternoon. (I was tired to begin with) It was a great nap. I kept waking up to more crazy animated gore and violence and would try to get back into the video but eventually gave up. I will give it another go when I'm more awake ad maybe when one of my gamer friends comes by.
1,I found a new drinking game,"To show how untalented this band is, we came up with a drinking game. Take a drink everytime the singer says ""Death"" or ""dead"". That's all he knows how to say. It's worse than teenage poetry.If this is Cleopatra's step toward the future, then the future looks dim. Or, shall I say in true Pitbull Daycare style... the future looks DEAD!"
5,Total Knee Replacement & Rehabilitation: The Knee Ower's Manual,This book was very helpful in knowing what to expect when having a total knee replacement. So much of the information is not provided by the doctor or physical therapist.
5,glue,titebond 111 has been using this glue for quite sometine now. Love it. Good set up time. Easy cleanup and sanding
1,When Oral History Goes Wrong,"This book was the worst example of oral history I've ever encountered. Riddled with scenes of witchcraft, sex, and other crazy tales, true history is hard to find in this book.I would not suggest this book to anyone except for a laugh. How interviewing someone who is 105 years old as the only source for a book seems crazy to me. This craziness is reflected throughout the biography."
1,La Mission,"Not the worst film of all time but pretty darn close. Awful acting, horrendous screen play, few ridiculous tag lines that nobody in their right mind will ever use makes this film well worth staying away from. If you enjoy watching terrible movies you might get a good chuckle out of this."
3,below par for tiesto,i love tiesto overall- but this one just doesn't make the grade. gave it several spins then plugged in majik 6. now i'm smiling again. suggest you look to offerings like summerbreeze and the magik series for tiesto at his best.
4,Easy healthy recipes,"This is amazing for someone who wants an easy way to cut down on meat in your diet, great quick ideas for vegetarian meals. Best part is, the ingredients are mostly things you already have in your kitchen (no rare hard-to-find vegetables!). One down-side is the lack of pictures, especially for those who like to SEE food, but picture inclusion would probably add extra pages to this wonderfully compact book."
5,Great!,"My wife and I have both wanted to go vegetarian for some time now, for our and our daughters sake. We browsed many cookbooks and finally decided on this one. It's absolutely wonderful! Very easy and to the point directions. We wanted to try the Spicy Zucchini quesadilla's... THEY ARE AMAZING!"
5,Great for New Vegetarians,"I love this book. I have been a vegetarian for only 2 years so am still exploring the vast variety of food options available (including many new ethnic foods that I have never heard of). This book is wonderful for those just transitioning into the vegetarian diet. the ingredients are simple to use and easy to find. My FAVORITE part of this book is that all of the dishes are for single or double servings. For a student or single person living alone, it is great to be able to only cook for one and not waste food. Additionally, it allows me to try new flavors without cooking a large meal. I would recommend it to anyone who is thinking about becoming a vegetarian, anyone on a tight budget (and who doesn't have access to specialty ethnic grocers), or anyone who is thinking of trying new flavors but is afraid to try it in a ""fancy"" way. Kudos to the author."
1,Just Plain Nasty,"When I looked at this book in the bookstore I just looked at the titles of the recipes, all of which sounded really good. For example the Pad Thia and Pasta with Greens. The sauce for the Pad Thia was disgusting, it contained ketchup, soy sauce, and sugar to name a few items. Not at all authentic or palatable. The pasta with greens sounded good but it calls for a creamy sauce made from cottage cheese, tossed with pasta and kale. I think the goal of this book was to create recipes that included easy to find and inexpensive items, but the result was not a success."
2,Simple but lack flavor,"I tried four or five of the recipes in the book and although they were simple to prepare, they, in general, lacked flavor.The falafel turned out quite mushy and devoid of flavor.The barley mushroom soup took some time to prepare and did not have a lot of flavor. It needed a lot of salt and pepper to be mildly enjoyable.The White Bean Jumble was just OK.Anyways, I just kinda gave up. I am not a professional cook but I do cook 5 meals a week.If you want a much better book try ""125 best Vegetarian Slow Cooker recipes"", now those flavors rock!"
5,vegetarian cookbook,great book with lots of easy recipes. my college daughter carries it around with her and has made several of the recipes.
1,A Disappointment,"I was extremely disappointed with this book. I only found 1 or 2 recipes that looked good, most of the recipes look like they would be tasteless and not filling. There is a lot of recipes for pizza and stir fry, which I don't need a cookbook for. I was expecting more variety.There is like 10 recipes for coffee??"
3,Good Thriller,"I just saw the DVD version of this film, and likedit. I loved the O'Henry like twist at the end.The color, sound and photography were very good.I would have liked it more, as a psycological Thriller,if we didn't know whom the killer was, almost fromthe beginning.Longnecker was very good/believable."
1,THE LEGACY OF LONGNECKER,"The star of this really dumb movie is Jane Longnecker. Why would anyone seeking an acting career goe with a name like Longnecker? And her co-star is Dean St. Louis. Where were their agents when they chose such ridiculous names? What's next Minnie Apellas St. Paul? Or how about Della Ware Heights? Oh, well. THE CORONER is one poorly done piece of cinematic waste. Aside from the awful acting, the script is so lame and ridiculous, there can be no chance for even suspending disbelief. Longnecker's character does so many stupid things and the esoteric ending is laughably pointless. If you find it in a bargain bin, choose something else..you won't be missing a thing."
5,Great Book!!!!,"Perfect for my studies, it goes into detail with fantastic diagrams and pictures. Mrs. Fritz has done it again, with her easy to read style.Thank you!!"
3,needs some tweaking,"Overlong chapters and a choppy writing style make this book difficult to use at times. There is a lot of good information but it is written in such a mannner that re-reading is necessary to clarify the topic of the paragraph. It is written with a tight economical use of words and becomes difficult for the reader to digest the information overload. Could use a little editing. Otherwise a good text. Addendum: After writing my orginal review and going through the book more, I have to state Appendix ""A"" of this book is a total nightmare. If you need to study pathology, get a different book. I am a licensed, practicing health care professional in the health field for over 15 years. I know pathology. This appendix even confused me, not to mention fellow LMT students who were pulling their hair out trying to sort out the mess of confusion. I finally gave up on it and went to different sources for information on tests we needed to take."
1,Should be called the unbelievers commentary,I purchased this with the expectation that it would help me in my study of the bible. But what I got was a commentary that starts every book of the bible by stating how unreliable the text is and who actually wrote it. It just fills your head with doubt and weakens your foundation that is the word of God. Don't wast your time or money on this commentary.
3,not much action,"Doesn't anyone realize that this movie doesn't have a whole lot of action?The battle between king ghidorah, rodan, mothra, and godzilla was short but good. The only problem was that in the middle of it it was interupted by the people. I thought that it could have been better but it was good."
5,"Ghidorah, The Three Headed Monster","I am a Godzilla fan from my childhood 40 years ago. Ghidorah is the only arch enemy of Godzilla that is notreally conquered by our favorite atomic breath spewing monster. Of course in this one some negotiations goon between Rodan and Mothra to aid in the quest to defeat the Big G. If you are a serious fan or loverof Godzilla or any of the Japanese monsters, you must have this one. This one sets the stage for a coupleof the other movies such as ""Monster Zero"". I highly recommend this movie."
1,Blank lined pages,"I wanted a hard copy of all my address contacts. However, when I opened the package all the insert pages are blank lined sheets. There are no division lines between entries nor is there a separate column indicating phone, work numbers etc. This is a very free form messy way to organize your contact information. I found what I needed from Franklin Covey."
3,nice refill,"My Day timer leather, zippered binder is over 20 years old and still functioning. I wish that the new refills were on a heavier stock, especially the major pages like the 1 month calender pages, but progress has lead to lighter weight pages. Sigh. I also wish for an Internet refill page for websites and passwords. The ones they offer just don't meet my needs for simplicity of organization."
5,Great,I chose this because I want to get organized this year and I love that it wasn't too expensive. Seemed like a good buy.
1,Golf for Dummies - miniature version,"what a ripoff. the ""miniature version"" is stashed in the details, not placed in the title. the reviews are for the full version. and now i feel like ""amazon shopping for dummies"". i have absolutely no use for a 2""x2"" book on anything."
2,Lots of fluff before you get to what you really need to know,"This book is not funny--full of not-funny jokes. (Um, who the hell is Dick Clark, anyway?) IDG tries to get you to buy their books by putting esoteric material in layman's terms, along with a liberal sprinkling of jokes. Some of their books are funny and well-written, this one is not. I do not recomend this book. It hasn't helped. I could have spent the money on another golf lesson. I am still reading through it, but it is slow going and painful. I can't afford another book. Too bad huh? Definitely go on a recommendation instead of buying blind."
1,WTF...!?!,"I would agree with the other CURRENT reviews of this product!!I was expecting a beginners' book on ""how to play golf;"" and ALL I got was a small booklet with scarcely not enough information on how to do a setup, a proper takeaway/backswing, etc. etc. and small ""utility tool"" for which there even no instructions!?!Buyers: BEWARE of this...!!!"
3,Was expecting More!,"I was expecting a book with step by step instructions on how to play golf for someone that has not played before. Instead, a mini-pamphlet is included with a golf tool. Not too helpful for someone new to the sport!"
1,FLAMMER HAS NOT BEEN SOLD ONLINE FOR 7 YEARS!!!!,The book stated the Flammer golf training aid was available for sale online and was one of his top training aids. I wasted 3 hours online trying to find one for sale and ultimately discovered the inventer is dead and the online retailers said the last time they had the flammer in stock was 7 YEARS ago!!! The authors of this book are dummies and need to do their research before writing misinformation and wasting my time.
1,Thought I was ordering the real book not the miniature.,"what a ripoff. the ""miniature version"" is stashed in the details, not placed in the title. the reviews are for the full version. and now i feel like ""amazon shopping for dummies"". i have absolutely no use for a 2""x2"" book on anything."
4,decent book even for an experienced golfer,"i have the dvd from the author on Netflix as well and the book is a good companion for even an experienced golfer. Just like other 'dummies' series, the tone fits well and is a good read."
4,Great Book for beginners,This book has helped me as a beginner golfer. It has been asort of personal trainer without being stiff. I recommend itto those of us who are not professional golfers.
5,Better than Idiot Guide and I liked that... DETAILED!,"This is an excellent beginners book as well as a terrific reference book. I had also purchased the Idiot guide and thought it was great, this book is filled with alot more. I am referring to the 2nd Edition.Straight forward knowledge and definations with a host of pictures to illustrate. Break down of information is well organized and even goes so far as to tell you where to go for the most important information.For the beginner but also for a point of reference. Easy to read easy to understand and easy to put into motion. Previously I had chose between the Idiot Guide and the 1st Edition, and chose the Idiot Guide, if I had the choice now between the Idiot and 2nd Edition THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN THE ONLY BOOK PURCHASED. Fully detailed and excellent reference, sure to have a long shelf life."
4,An Italian Superstar!,"This is a great album! With Lauras most popular Italian songs translated into spanish versions! As usual she has an extremely beautiful and powerful voice and is a joy to listen to in whichever language she sings in! She does sing a lot better in italian though, but that is because that it is her mother tounge, this is still and AMAZING album and she sings beautifully on it!"
1,Don't buy it,Do not buy this book. Its most likely you've learnt the exercises at PE class in High School. It dedicates one page on nutrition so good luck getting the abs displayed on the cover.
2,Not completely worthless,"Many people in the reviews have pointed out how many exercises are too advanced but lack to point out many are also too simplistic. My problems with the book is it seems to be lacking and could have included more exercises. Also theres only one intensity for most of the exercises, after you master the ""harder"" ones it doesnt get any harder. I find it hard to believe that someone like Jay Cutler could use this book and not lose mass to his abs."
1,Maybe I got a lemon,"I got this system not quite a year ago and in recent months it does not properly record timed programs at all. The unit fails during recording, and if the recording is completed, it will not finalize the disc and error messages are displayed that are not printed in the manual. Prerecorded movies play beautifully, but the sound from the rear surrounds is soft to non-existant, and it does not have auto resume. My first theatre in a box was a Panasonic and I loved it, but I wanted to be able to record and I now regret this purchase, it was a mistake."
2,I'm not impressed.,I was looking for a clean and concise approach to XML. Instead I got the impression that this book was just an excuse for the author to squeeze in as much minutia on SGML as he thought he could get away with.It does give good background on XML along with a mind numbing amount of hype.Look elsewhere for a good introduction to using XML.
1,Spacefiller without any real focus,"This is obviously a book where the authors commited themselves to writing a certain number of pages and then, half-way into the work they realized that didn't have enought material to cover it. The totally useless 100-page poorly-commented pre-release Java source code for a DOM-implementation in chapter 10 is a particularily good example of this.Another horrible chapter is chapter 11, which contains an explataion of user interface interaction that is so overly abstract but still so extremely stupid that I've used that particular chapter as an example of how a really useless book should be written.Also, early in the book the author explains that the book is amed towards rpogrammers. It's interesting to see that they hardly ever back their examples up with and source code at all.In short. Don't buy this book."
5,Understanding PTSD,"I just read the first chapter on your site and look forward to reading the entire book. Jim creates reality that the reader visualizes. ""Love Held Hostage"" contributes to understanding PTSD and the stress of war, something that has escaped the general public for far too long. Read ""Love Held Hostage"" and learn, then sympathize."
4,very helpful,I found this book very helpful. I used it often at work. The one thing I wished is that it wouldn't constantly refer to future parts of the book. I also wish it had more pictures. However overall it is a great resource.
5,Courage on all levels in Life,I loved this story set in the back drop of Japan. D.H. Cemeno captivates the reader who begins to understand the cultural and personal struggles of Debito-San. From the minute he gets off the train to take on his new work opportunity to the trials and tribulations of a love in a foreign country the author takes you on a personal story of courage. I had a hard time putting the book down as it leads you to each chapter with strength in its storyline that prompts you to want to know what happens next.
1,Piece of junk!,This is a piece of junk! Don't bother! Just stopped working one day after about 8 months of ownership and maybe 10 uses. Don't buy!
4,Okay Taste,I've tried several teas like this but they all tasted horrible but this one doesn't taste that bad.
3,Smooth Move,"I usually don't like tea AT ALL but this has a nice flavor and I enjoyed drinking it. I used it because my mother told me about it and recommended it (she loves it); she said it was very gentle with no crampy, gassy, sudden urge to go side effects like most laxatives. That was NOT the case with me. I took it before bed and about ten hours later I got horrible gas and cramping which led to me hurrying to the bathroom soon afterwards for a very crampy and unpleasant bowel movement. I would definitely give it a try if you haven't because it works very well. Its just a matter of figuring out how the tea is going to effect you personally."
4,only nonstick with flour /oil spray,"When I first used this Bund pan, I was sooo disapointed, cause I loveall my Calphalon Commercial nonstick.Everytime I baked a cake in this, it would stick, and come out inchunks. I would try and put it together, but it just looked ugly,nothing I would serve to company.I tryed different oil sprays and nothing worked,until I used the Flour/oil sprays.When I sprayed it with just the oil it would run down the sidesand all.Now This works fantastic. All my cakes come out perfect inone piece.There are allot of nooks and craneys, so make sure your gettingall those little places covered with the flour/oil spray, also do notforget to spray the middle tube part."
3,Non-Stick?,"It's a nice, heavy cake pan, but don't call it non-stick. Even with baking spray my cake stuck badly."
4,Excellent for intermediate players!!,"Sierawan's ""Winning Chess Openings"" is a book that focuses on players of intermediate strength. He takes a main line with the four main openings (King's pawn, Queen's pawn; both white & black) and explains and illustrates why and how a position is reached.One draw back is that there are many variations to each ""main line."" While this may be good, I thought each variation should have had it's own section to avoid confusing the reader."
1,"defective poor quality, down comes out","Bad quality, received with 3 spots with really tiny holes on the exernal material with the down coming out from the holes. I returned it of course. Maybe this is the only one with defect, maybe others are? I do not know but would not take a chance in this coat again. It was time lost but the money was promised to be refunded."
2,terrible movie,Martin lawrence's movie's keep getting worse. I wish he would make movies that were sort of funny like he used to. I don't even think I smiled during this movie.
1,Did not work,"I bought a battery for my compaq contura 410, but it did not workI reclaimed and received a refund for the item."
5,inspiring,Wanted to try the authors recipes after seeing her television show. Even though the recipes seem to have many ingredients the results are treasures. Vegetable dishes using veggies we seldom used added a new way to use seasonal supplies.
4,Wrong!,"Both reviews above are referring to recordings other than the one offered here. What is offered here is the live Bruckner 5th Symphony taped in the Musikvereinsaal in Vienna with the Wiener Philharmoniker under the direction of Otto Klemperer on June 2, 1968."
5,Rituales rock's...,"I learn how to apreciate music when I heard about this guys. Spicy words with a touch of simpathy on the instruments. I wish to know them to let them know how I feel. You better buy it, is the best buy on the latin acoustic rock in the market. Azul is my personal favorite. They are making another album, I can't wait. Keep rocking rituales, I'm fan #1.Sinceramente;Julio Charneco, jr"
4,It depends on your needs and expectations,"People's reactions to this seem to vary widely depending on how they plan to use it, and their expectations. I'd note that their expectations aren't that realistic, in some cases. Do you expect it to be perfect, or just a significant step forward? Some people are surprised the included mic doesn't work well for every possible audio application (!); others - like me - are surprised it includes a mic at all!Google on these words to see some very detailed reviews, they may be helpful in knowing what to expect, given how you plan to use it:m-audio microtrack reviewIt's far from perfect, but I'm not sure why people expect it to be, as the alternatives are all far from perfect. It's well worth considering if you're looking for a reasonably priced recorder.Some might want to look into the recording capabilities of the latest generation of iPods (the video iPod)."
2,Not meant for loud recordings,I agree with Arrayman. It is not meant to record loud signals which is a let down for me since I bought it to record live gigs. Upgrading to the latest firmware version 1.23 still does not address this issue.I guess back to the MD for me.
3,Not enough battery time,"Great audio recording ability, but the 4 hour battery life does not get me through an 8 hour seminar. The unit will not record while plugged in you must charge it first. I wish I had known that before my important meeting. You need to spend another $50 on a battery sled to get any real time with the Microtrack, which then makes the whole thing too big and cumbersome."
2,I have problems with the firmware update,"I try to update the firmware, but after this the microtrack could not turn on again.I had to send back to tech support to fix the problem, and I did not receive the product fixed.I like the compactness and the quality."
1,Works great...until it dies on you.,"An entire 5 months after I bought the Microtrack II it won't power on, won't charge, is unresponsive, and basically a $200 paperweight. The company that makes this knows the battery is worthless, the warranty specifically excludes the battery after three months. They'll graciously repair it for you after for $70, what a rip off. They're setting up anyone who buys it."
2,Great Until the Battery Runs Out,"A local pro audio store sold me one of these with the claim ""It is the only serious recorder capable of pro results."" There may be some truth to that. With the SPDIF in, you have some serious options for a front end signal chain. However, after a year or so, the battery ceases to hold a charge. Then what is it? Junk."
1,I really didn't like this book . . .,"I really think Ellis is over rated. His fixation on cruelty and pain is just disturbing. I think many readers think that just because a book disturbs them, it must be good literature. This isn't right. With 'American Psycho,' Ellis created a character and there was a message to his maddness. Although I hated liking it, I liked it none the less. But The Informers says absolutely nothing and often made me feel just plain sick. Reading a lot of Ellis's work is like watching a talented artist paint something ugly. Well, this book is just ugly."
2,Well . . .,"This is the most I've ever been disappointed after reading a novel. Ellis is a great writer, but this collection of stories is terrible. I think I remember reading somewhere that he wrote this in high school; which is pretty impressive, but it's lacking in entertainment value and nothing seems to happen in any of the stories. These are good character sketches as another reviewer has mentioned and could probably be turned into interesting novels if Ellis chose to build on them, but he doesn't and they get boring halfway through. If you're a hardcore Ellis fan you might want to pick this up for the sake of having a complete collection, otherwise you should skip this."
4,An interesting read,"I read this book a few years ago and was totally blown away by its emptiness and futility. It takes a lot of talent for an author to make people feel the kinds of emotions one feels for the characters in this book. Ellis does this easily, sometimes too easily, and leaves you wanting more. I have re-read 'Informers' two or three times since then and still love it. Even though Ellis seems to have only one point in any of his novels, that is to make the reader feel empty contemptment toward his characters, all of his books are a great read. But surely he will have to try harder to do better than 'Less Than Zero'."
2,Less than Less Than Zero,"""Danny is on my bed and depressed because Ricky was picked up by a break-dancer at the Odyssey on the night of the Duran Duran look-alike contest and murdered"". If that line dopesn't make you laugh out loud (or at least cringe) than BEE may not be the dude for you. However, if you enjoy the odd Danielle Steel literary epic from time to time, you might want to pick ""The Informers"" up, post haste. Because BEE has nothiong on DS -- same league, my friends, same league...."
5,Biology of plants,This book was exactly what I wanted and it was in better shape than the ones at my bookstore even were. I was impressed!!!
5,A vision of truth!,"Cincinnati is now and has been in a state of racial hatred from the police department for many years (since the 1800's). Mr. Kelvin Davis has exposed just a few of the many overlapping protective systems utilized by the Hamilton County and the Greater Cincinnati Law enforcement agencies. While covering up the terroristic methods used to protect officers who don their badges as weapons of personal racial hate on people of color a search for a inkling of justice remains elusive. Truth be known, there is no justice in Cincinnati for people who challenge the County's practices of racial profiling and the cover up that soon follows! Many people from Cincinnati hate what black citizens are forced to endure in the year 2002! Great job Mr. Davis."
4,Beres Hammond,"the man has soul and a connection to a higher power. I really enjoy his voice, words, music"
4,Henry's a great guy,"I really appreciate the fact that a comedian can be funny without being vulgar, offensive or rely heavily on cursing. Henry is definitely a comedian I can enjoy listening to, from beginning to end, without fear of wincing because of language or material.The quality of this video on my Kindle Fire was very good. I was pleased with this purchase."
4,Spock's pre Kirk adventure.,Star Trek lore tells us that Spock was with the Enterprise before Kirk took over as Captain.This is a story of Spock and Captain Pike solving a murder mystery and finding an ancient Gemstone.Written by one of the better TOS episode writers.
5,The cards make it so much easier.,These cards really help when trying to decide what your archetypes are. I love the illustrations and the descriptions. Great companion with the Sacred Contracts book or CDs.
2,Dark Side?,"Caroline Myss does not go to the Dark Side with these archetype cards! Don't know why, but just as there is a light or solar side to the archetypes there is the polar opposite, the Dark Side as well. She does try to point out the shadow side but again the descriptors are vague an they are on the ""UP"" New Age side. The Buzz Words she uses for the archetypes could be expanded more and maybe divided into levels like physical, emotion and mental. All in all, these cards do not reflect the Jungian archetypes Carolyn develops so well in her book, ""Sacred Contracts."""
2,For completist mopheads only *sheepish grin*,"The cover shows Douglas beating a hasty retreat from irate fans confronted by yet another stop gap album to line his pockets. Even Socialist art is more exciting than this dismal offering. I was especially amused to find track 15 sounding like BIKO. It is time for Mr P (for it is he) to stop releasing reductive and pointless old material and start writing some reductive and pointless new material. Preferably with some nifty synth dance rhythms a-la NADA! And a distinct lack of porcine references.The inside picture shows Douglas looking alarmingly like Eugene Terre-Blanche and seemingly geared to pen some autographs in an empty field of rape, which says a lot."
4,Very good service!,I received the book in exactly the shape the seller said it would be in and quicker than I thought I would receive it. I was very happy with the purchase.
4,Much cheaper than Beano-O,Much cheaper than Beano-O and I use it all the time. I eat lots of beans and split peas because they are cheap and nutritious.
2,Product has changed,"Product is not as effective as the tablets. I've been using this product for years because it used to be the best deal available. Not only has it gone up in cost but the product change from tablets to capsules has IMHO rendered it less effective. I suspect it has lowered the amount of the active ingredients in each capsule. If this is the case and we'll never know unless someone know how to test for it, customers are being shortchanged and the bargain we think we are getting is not there. You can get 100 count Beano for under 10.00 when on sale and with the increased number of tablets I have to take for the product to be effective, 5 tablets instead of 2-3, there really is no savings. I'm going to ask the company directly why the product isn't working as well since the change."
1,Bean-zyme review time,"so far I have used up about half the bottle. I really don't find any difference as to the way it is supposed to work. Actually, I still have the same problem I had before I started taking it, however I must say that my ""condition"" is not as intolerable as it was."
3,amazon should select a qualified item,"i found there is a little damage in the blade when i received the item, i don't know why but just suggest amazon should selet those qualified things."
1,CAUTION,IT TOOK THE COMPANY (SMOKY MOUNTAIN KNIFE WORKS) A WEEK TO ALERT ME THAT IT WAS OUT OF STOCK. YET THEY STILL HAVE THE KNIFE POSTED FOR SALE. CALLED S.M.K.W. CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THEY PUT ME ON HOLD 4 TIMES FOR A TOTAL OF 15 MIN. TERRIBLE! WATCH OUT!
4,The Real Man Behind the Mouse,"You would never have heard of Walt Disney without the contiual guidance and support of his brother Roy.Roy O. Disney was the organizational leader who kept his younger brother Walt's vision on track.This book is an enjoyable journey behind one of the most successful entertainment companies in history... but also essential reading if you work with a visionary leader because they can drive people crazy sometimes.If you work around, (or are married to), a visionary leader then it will help you tremendously to see how Roy was able to come alongside his creative genius brother, (read as ADD), to accomplish the impossible without a big budget.I recommend you check this out if you are looking for ways to help the visionary leader in your life move forward to change the world."
4,"valuable text, dull read","One of the most fact-packed, intelligent studies of globalization, but this is noone's beach reading. I recommend reading the intro and thereafter using it as a reference.For a more literary, bizarre, and stimulating take on the contemporary global condition, check out Hardt and Negri's Empire."
1,"Looks new, but bad copy","Received this, no cellophane on the case, hmmm. Opened the case, sure looks new. Played it, what a great concert, enjoying the music immensely....then stops, digital disarray, skips, starts, then stops...crap!"
5,beyond words,"This is an amazing, genre-busting CD. Everything that is good about music is here; the influences and flavors run across the spectrum. If this album doesn't move you, check your pulse. Must be heard to be believed."
3,Belle pièce de collection,"C'est très intéressant d'entendre les débuts de ce groupe qui n'a suivi aucune mode et qui a su se réinventer à chaque album. Le son est excécrable, mais sion est un amateur de ce groupe, on pardonne."
1,Company never sent product and never responded to e-mail!,"Do not buy from this company. They never sent the item. They never responded to my e-mail, yet they took my money. Will now have to dispute this with my bank. Very unfortunate because I really like this product."
1,Quick and easy - way too sweet,"Simply Asia noodle bowls are very convenient and easy. Unfortunately our family found them almost inedible. I say almost because our 4 your old will still eat them. The rest of us found all of the flavors sickly sweet, to a point where we wont eat them anymore. We tried Chili Garlic, Roasted Peanut, and Kung Pao."
3,Do Your Homework,"I originally bought an LG 52SX4D the first had visible streaks of light on the screen and would not come on or cut off at times. I got a replacement, which had a beautiful picture, but again it would not come on one time, which was enough for me to change to another brand (Mitsubishi). It is working perfectly, but has a noticeable ""screen door effect"" which I have decided is not worth the extra $$ to upgrade to the DLP model. Anyways get what suits you and your budget and remember almost all current technologies have certain trade offs as far as picture quality is concerned."
4,Magnificent,"The best of the alien invasion kaiju flicks.The Xilians are one of the more visually interesting bunches of aliens to threaten earth. I love the funky sunglasses.This film is solid scifi goodness from end to end, with a human plot just as amusing as the Kaiju battles.Also, it is definitely worth a watch dubbed to get Nick Adams' original performance."
3,More like the Non Phixion Mixtape,"This album is nothing like I expected. The DVD is awesome though, so it makes it a worthwhile purchase if your a goon. I didnt like how most of the songs though are under 1 minute, and ""Skum"" my favorite song on the cd (and on uncle howie sample fall 04) was cut off by a minute to go into some freestyle. I like the freestyles but I'd rather hear Non Phixion doing songs instead of freestyles. I think that it was just to hold goons over til the next album."
3,Errors,"Fortunately, I picked this book out at the library instead of buying it first because like another reviewer mentioned, it has some serious instructional errors. The pattern I checked-the book out for is so confusing, I wasn't even close to be able to figure out how to adjust for the missing instructions. I've had problems with Vanna White books but they're usually small things you can easily figure out but this one was too tough a cookie for me and I have been crocheting for over 35 years and know how to read patterns well.There are some beautiful patterns in here, some of the nicest ""basket weave"" I've seen, but I wouldn't recommend buying this book unless an addendum of corrections is available."
4,"Great bag, strap not so good","Beautiful bag! Bought the olive brown color, much nicer in person, richer med brown color than the picture online, just beautiful. Bag is sturdy, well made, plenty of room for weekend trip. Lining is nice, just the one pocket inside but roomy. Strap is thin not comfortable for carrying on shoulder when bag is even slightly full. Overall beautiful bag, may want to consider upgrading the strap Floto offers after trying out original strap, at least there is that option."
2,very poorly designed headphones,1. The cord between the two phones is too short.2. The coiled cord connecting the headphones to the ipod is too short3. the quality of the sound produced by the phones is -10.4. The phones leak and fall out of my ears while swimming.
1,Problems with Visioneer,"I had technical problems with my Visioneer scanner and severe problems with their customer service department - everything from a 17-21 minute hold on the phone before getting a human to a 3-month (so far) wait for a replacement machine. Visioneer refuses to refund money because my customer service problems have gone on longer than 30 days and because I didn't purchase the machine through their website. Take great care in purchasing a Visioneer product. Dealing with Customer Service can be stressful and totally unrewarding - no money, no machine."
2,The CD is worth more than the book.,"I was hoping to learn how to program with Dephi 5 (the Standard edition is included on the CD). I learned old school Object Pascal console mode programming from this book. This book is overpriced at a lot of money it should go for about a little bit of money, but I think the other an amount, went to Borland (the software company who created Delphi). Good for beginning programmers, weak for intermediate level, unless you are just buying it to get a copy of Delphi 5 Standard Edition. I gave it one star for the book and one for the CD."
1,GARBAGE DIDNT GET BIRDS,IN MY YARD. THE BAG OF CORN CAME BEAT TO HECK. BROKEN DRIED OUT NOT FRESH FOR BIRDS AND MY SQURIEELS YO-YO. DUMB SQUIRRREILS BOUCE ALL DAY AND NEVER GET EVEN A KERREL DONT BUY THIS GO TO YOUR LOCAL FARMERS MARKET OR GROW SOME YOURSELF TRULY CRAP.
4,Beautiful knife,"This knife looks better in person than in the pictures, however it's a bit smaller than one might expect. There is a heft to it that makes it feel nice in the hand. I love stacked leather handles and this seems like it would hold up to many years of use. I haven't had the pleasure of using it as a skinner yet, however I have no doubt that it will function well. The sheath is just OK, but is thick and should last for the life of the knife. For the light duty jobs that I've used this in so far, it's been great."
1,Forget this Shoe!,"Sorry folks but as someone who has real problems finding shoes that fit his 11 1/2 AA feet, this shoe fails the test. It feels cheap, and it did not really fit my feet at all. Save your money and try another brand."
4,Propet Walking Shoes,"Very fine Propet walking shoes, made of soft but sturdy high quality leather. These shoes are very similar to the diabetic walking shoes approved by Medicare, but at a fraction of the price. They have plenty of inside height to fit custom made insoles. Save yourself a $100 and buy these from Amazon instead of paying full retail at your prosthetic store!I bought 2 pair!"
5,Great shoe at a great price!!!!,"I bought these ones for my husband and he is very pleased with this purchase.Pretty comfort,he have the grey nubuck color and we just got it for $15.59 and free shipping.What a deal! We are very pleased!"
3,"Not a high-end shoe, but ok for short term","The Propet Stabilty Walker was worth its reasonable price, but those of us, like myself, who have foot issues that require a higher-end walker like the New Balance 900 series will find it inadequate. The heel is loose for a B width, and the shoe is insufficiently structured to give needed support. I'll keep the shoes for going to the movies, but I'll go back to the New Balance for exercise and all-day wear."
5,Excellent and different,"This is a interesting read not only for karateka, but for people interested in Japanese arts.It's different because the author manages to raise the concepts to a level where he also can discuss them in relation to other arts, and modern science. And that without becoming too speculative. It's also different in the sense that I find that despite the book being about shotokan, I believe he sometimes end up saying the same things that those who critique traditional arts tend to say. (!) Or to put it in another way, he closes the distance between the traditional and the modern.The book also have several appendix that are especially useful for reference for shotokan students and instructors, such as a pretty good glossary, class outlines, and kata run through.Highly recommended!!"
2,Much too difficult for most to plow through,"Hats off to Dr. Schmeisser for having a complete understanding of his chosen art. However, it should be pointed out that his PhD is NOT in karate and writing a book in a style which is more appropriate for a professional journal can be very difficult for most people to read. The concepts, although fully comprehended by Elmar, are not really that difficult to grasp and could have been explained in much simplier terms. The diagrams are also muddled (as most 'technical' diagrams are) and should have been reworked prior to publication. If you decide to get this book, be prepared to work at reading it and do not even think of getting it if you are below a black belt level, you'll just get confused."
3,Looks better in the picture.,"Nicely designed, but frankly it looks better in the picture than in 3D reality. A little on the cheap side, but fun to wear, esp for a kid."
4,Yay!,"Got this yesterday after maybe 4 days shipping which was super fast! Husband put it together in less than 30 minutes, love that it plugs in and makes such sweet music. Can't wait for baby to use it!"
5,plugs in!!,LOVE this swing! especially since it has a plug and i dont have to worry about getting batteries!! sooo important in a swing.. my son used this for a long time too cuz he enjoyed to nap in it.
4,the music motor stopped after 3 months.,"this is a great swing, very comfy for the baby, my baby used to take all her naps in it, reclines, you can change positions if the baby gets bored. great colors, the toys are the best toys ever, big with big eyes, my baby will smile and talk to them all the time, you can charge it electrically which is great ...it has 4 kinds of music, we used mostly the one for sleeping , very soothing, my baby will sleep within minutes. the only problem is that the music stopped working after 3 months of use, which was very disappointing to me, because it was very good feature. I have the rainforest gym mat which I used its music for sleep and it worked. the rainforest collection is the best! though the same toys but my baby never gets bored of them."
3,Not sure I would buy again,"This swing is the only one I could find that had the plug-in option, obviously better for the pocketbook and environment than a battery eater. However, the seat is pitched back so far that my 4 month old always cranes his neck to look around and looks uncomfortable. Fisher Price could add months of usefullness to this product by just adding another tilt option so babies who want to sit up can. I have had it for a month and a half and wish I could justify the price and size it's taking up in my apt. Should have bought it earlier!"
2,Just to loud,I really like almost everything about the swing. If it wasnt for the super loud mobile I would absolutely love it. I sent the first one back thinking that it was just a defect. When the second one came and I put it together there was no change. The mobile is louder than the music and there is a horrible clicking sound when the mobile is trying to spin. I was competely let down by this product since there were such high rating.I do not recommend this product.
2,returned 3 times,"I bought this swing because it was the only one that I could find with a plug in. Since this is not my first child I know how many batteries you can go threw. I have had to return this item 3 times and although I love the design and the colors, I would love it more if it worked all the time. I did by a forth one and I know your thinking why would you buy it four times.. I lost my reciept.The first one was unbalanced so when it rocked it looked like it was going to tip over. The second one wouldn't play the music. The third one wouldn't swing with the baby in it. My Forth one is working but four times shouldn't be your lucky charm.I just think that Fisher-price could do a better job on this item and I don't recommend it."
1,No recall Yet?,"I'm really disappointed. There has been no recall on this product.I had it for ten days and the motor died. Now, I just sit and push.It's not worth the postage to send back.What a shame, and shame on fisher.Their customer service sucks.I have a number of products from them ie the aquarium, which has lost 20% of its water.Their quality has really fallen as of late.Will look elsewhere, advise you do the same."
4,Nice,This is a great swing. My baby loves it. I like how you can have it swing both side to side and front to back. Only thing I would change is to have a switch to turn the volume of the music down. I like how you can plug it into the wall or it can run on batteries.
2,Returned.....I guess it was defective?,"I was so excited to order this swing. My sister raves about her Ocean Wonders Cradle Swing. I ordered this one instead because it plugged into the wall.When I got it I was very pleased with the colors. It looked so nice and the assembly was pretty quick and easy.However, it would barely swing with the baby in it. Since we already have traditional swing from subsequent children I was really puzzled. The highest swing setting was comparable to the lowest on my other swing. Baby was not happy after being used to faster motion.So I boxed it up and will be returning it tomorrow. So far the return process to amazon has been very smooth and easy. Go Amazon! I choose to get a refund as the replacement would have been the same swing and after reading some of these review it might not have been defective after all. I might have to try out my sisters in person before I decide if I will reorder the Ocean Wonders."
2,Ok,"I bought this swing thinking it would be perfect for my son. Although it is not a bad swing it is geared for smaller babies. My son is biger and taller and almost looks like he is going to fall out. The swing engine seems like its brooken even though its not and it does not swing so well. Every while I have to go give it a push to get it going again, maybe that is also due to my son's weight. The swing is not as comforatble material as other ones and does not lean back, making it not the greatest choice for a kid who likes to sleep in it and needs that lying down posisiton in order to do so. For people withsmaller babies I would say this is a good swing but for someone whose kids tend to be bigger I would say to go with one of the stronger models."
4,"Great swing, but a bit on the bulky side",I got this as a gift before I had my son. He enjoys this swing a lot. He was given this swing and a take along swing. Though honestly is the take along swing had a plug in option I would probably have given this one up. As I said it is pretty bulky and does not really store well unless you take it completely apart which can be problematic in a smaller space. It has provided many hours of comfort to my son though from newborn to five months and counting.
2,Too slow!,"We purchased this swing because of the plug-in feature (we were spending so much money on batteries for our Graco swing). It's an adorable swing, but it swings way too slow for our ""daredevil"" little girl. We had to take it back. I guess we'll just keep buying batteries. Too bad Graco doesn't make one that plugs in!"
2,Disappointed,"This did not live up to the promise of the first novel. Much of the success of the first book was the local color. Now we're dealing with the CIA and assorted international bs. Too bad. The end promises more, this is where I get off."
3,Short life span on my colormax bulbs,"I purchased 2 colormax and 2 50/50 bulbs for my 55 gallon fresh water planted tank, the bulbs give off a very nice color spectrum and look for the tank. My only issue is the colormax bulbs burnt out within 3 months of usage, which is the shortest lifespan of any flourescent/compact flourescent bulb I have ever owned. I am usually changing out my bulbs due to decreased wattage output due to normal age every 9 months but I might as well have spent a little more money on some new T5 bulbs for my outlet rather than the short lifetime these bulbs had. The 50/50 bulbs have been working flawlessly and I am very happy with them, like I said the color max both burned out within 2 days of each other at no more than 3 months of use (10 hours daily)."
1,DO NOT ORDER FROM ERIN BAKER,"Erin Baker is an unprofessional, self-serving company. I would not order from them unless you want to be berated by their staff. If your order is incorrect (which it often is), you have to jump through hoops to get it right."
2,Doesn't taste like peanut butter,"I'm not sure what these taste like (besides cardboard), but it's not peanut butter. Even the squirrels hesitated to eat what I couldn't of this ""cookie""."
1,He is a good honest patriot,"Why does not the author mention the facts that German don't pay for the war itself but holocaust only, nor Japan has treaties for it such as the Treaty on Basic Relations Between Japan and Korea ('65)?Yes, he is a good honest patriot."
4,Great,The bag was perfect. Airlines really trust Sherpa. They didn't look twice after they saw I had a Sherpa bag. I could have had 3 chihuahuas in there and it would not have mattered.
5,butterflies/disney,i am very happy with all the products that I have brought. The packing is done very well and the shiping is always on time.
5,simple but stunning,"My first ring purchase from Amazon. Never had a ring with so elegant looking but a ""low-end"" price. Garnet is not my birthstone but this ring caught my eyes by its simplicity and stunning dark red. It looks great on my finger. Really love it!"
2,As advertised but overpriced,I was looking for a small reusable notebook that I could just add pages to and I thought that this was a good solution to part of my problem. This product arrived on time and in great condition. The problem was that all of the pages are bound on the top so that every page has to be separated one by one to put into the binder. A real pain. The pages should have been separated to be useful. The price was higher than I would have liked to have paid but the convenience was very nice. I will not be buying this item again from anyone online.I do not hold the seller accountable for the product being bound or the high price. It probably comes already bound. The cost is more than I would pay for something so common anyway. I will resort to a spiral bound notebook in the future and just use multiple notebooks because of the cost factor in the future.
5,Long Lasting Multi-Purpose Blade,Great Blade! Seems to handle just about anything I need it for. Great tool for camping and just about anything where a large knife could be needed. Note: This knife is VERY large! It's about the size of typical survival knives. The squared-off end of the blade makes for a very very sharp edge and point. Very cheap price (Very hefty discount if you have Amazon Prime) worth every penny because i'm sure it will outlast any other blade. Very good sheath that comes stock. The sheath can be easily fastened to everything and has holes if you want to fasten using string and it has slits if you want to fasten using straps or other methods. Fast Shipping!
4,Great all around but....,"Great knife and sheath, The blade is too thin for my taste. Such as prying and wood chopping. Like half the Ka-Bars, 3/16 thick. But, it is a great all around knife that can take a beating."
5,My new shaver,Awesome knife. Feels great in the hand. Razor sharp cutting edge. I am going to shave with it tomorrow. Probably will get less razor burn using it than using my Mach 3...
5,Amazing,"This knife is amazing, and you can't beat the price. Holds a good edge and over all just seems like a great survival knife."
4,Killer look and feel; awesome build quality,"If you're looking for a knife that looks bloody damn good (and also does the usual required tasks of a knife), then this is a good choice.The black brushed metal look, with the Tanto edge is just killer.Very solid to hold, and overall build quality feels supreme to touch.I haven't tried cutting anything hard yet, but the blade seemed sharp enough to devour through layers of corrugated sheets like hot knife through butter.The handle is very solid, and seemed to be waterproof without any stickiness.The sheath it comes in is a bit bulky, but I like the sound it makes when I slide it in (maybe some glass lining inside of it?)Overall, a good buy if you've already decided to drop some considerable amount of money for a good all-rounder knife."
4,really interesting,"I really got a lot out of this book--it's a bit of a dry read at times, and some of the genetic science gets a little bit heavy (particularly in the beginning), but I learned a lot from reading. A lot of quotable new ideas in here that I wanted to talk about with friends immediately--the extinction of Neanderthals, the early advent of modern humans in Australia, the difference between human and animal as appreciated by a simple grammatical structure, and the ability to track lineage from placental and Y chromosom DNA being some things that spring immediately to mind. Worth dipping into."
4,Great 1st Pet,"What a great idea! We bought this for our 3-year old son who has been talking about getting a doggie for a year. It's a great way to get him ready for the responsiblilities of a pet. The only thing I wish were a little better is that the batteries seem to run out quickly because you can't turn it off...well if you do, you have to retrain the dog. We love it!"
3,Okay...according to the reviews...,"Well, my best friend, who loves dogs has it now, she said that it's pretty cute, but it NEVER obeys you. You can't really train it! It just does it whenever it wants, I recemend Go Go my walking pup better."
2,"Compressor Motor Frozen, Fan Blade Broken","Out of the box, the ""connection kit"" was loose. I plugged in the compressor and it just 'hummmed'. The Bostitch Help Desk was not very helpful. I brought the compressor to a recommended warranty service center. The'kit' needed to be tightened and the 'humming' motor was 'frozen' with a broken fan blade. The nailers are probably okay, but I couldn't try them."
4,Born in ice triology,"I enjoyed it very much and couldn't put it down.It wasn't a thriller and I do rather like Noras mystery\thrillers but the ""homely"" ones are good too.This had some good characters and the setting was interesting. I love to read a triology in one go i.e. one after the other.So it was good having the three in one."
2,"No runs, no hits, readers left on base","Ms. Roberts is fond of baseball, as evidenced in many of her books, and many of those books are home runs if not real grand slams, but she struck out with The Stars of Mithra. Secret Star was the weakest of the weak series. Roberts generally creates such good heroes and heroines that readers will overlook lacks or errors in plot details, but hackneyed and/or unbelievable characters--and, in this installment, a downright silly one like Grace--point out the flaws rather than hide them. Among other things, Roberts needs to better research police procedure and little details like the fact that .38s don't have have clips, but most of all she needs to spend more time executing the game plan for a book and making sure she doesn't make an easy out, leaving readers stuck on base instead of running across the plate of a satisfying read. Nobody wants to see a major leaguer sent back down to the minors."
1,Don't Try This at Home,"This was chosen for our book club based on an Amazon review. Of seven members present, only two of us completed reading it. Most members gave up after a few chapters which was a first. Our overall rating was a 1.6 and we would not recommend it to anyone."
1,Kindle Edition: Horrible reading experience,"This may well have been a fun and entertaining book, but the Kindle edition, which seems to have been poorly scanned, made reading the book difficult and frustrating. The book is riddled with typos and faulty OCR transcriptions - an absolute disgrace. This edition should not be for sale, and if I were the author I would be outraged to find my work offered for sale in this condition."
3,"Not that much ""Heat""!","Light & fast read. Sure they all had problems, but nothing earth shattering. Most of the stories were guarded, almost like no one wanted to admit that bad things happened. (or how they fixed them!) There were no real confessions, as I was hoping for some major dirt! The best story was from the Two Hot Tamale Ladies. Their story had me laughing and cringing! All in all, it was an ok read."
5,What not to do in the kitchen,"This is one of the funniest books, I have read. I have lent it to many friends and we have had a good laugh at many of the stories. It's nice to see that professional chefs can also have disasters in the kitchen."
5,Highly Entertaining - Top Chefs' Culinary Disasters,This book is a thoroughly entertaining collection of memorable disasters that have befallen well known chefs during their careers. A number of your Food Network favorites and others tell all... from dozens of spoiled lobsters to the chef that turned the hosts dogs loose on a damaged wedding cake in order to save the day. The chefs confess to challenges in which either amazing luck or noteworthy inventiveness was required to survive with reputation intact.
1,Made in Taiwan!,"Item not as described. Description says item stamped Olean, NY, like most Ka Bar knives. This one arrives and it's made in Taiwan. Knife is much smaller than expected. I would not have purchased if I knew the knife was made in Taiwan."
2,Disappointing . . .,"""Kodocha"" was one of the first manga series I bought, and it's always been one of my very favorites. I knew there was an anime, so of course, I was very excited when I heard that it was coming to the US.I'm not one of those people who hates anime based on manga because it's ""not as good as the original"". But I really did not like ""Kodocha"". The first problem was the voice acting. Sana was fine in the English, but Akito's voice was way too deep. In the Japanese, I didn't like Sana's voice very much.My biggest problem was the way Sana was portrayed. They made her way too silly and obnoxious in my opinion, and it's really hard to take her seriously. She was a little air-headed in the manga, but I really think the anime overdid it.Overall, I would advise you to just stick with the manga."
3,Update and Installation Problems 8920 USB,"At a low price the scanner is a reasonable buy. Buying this scanner used may be a good option. Users may give up trying to install it, leaving the scanner in ""as new"" condition.The ""Check for OneTouch Updates"" options starts to download then at the 30 seconds to go mark says it's unable to connect with server. When retry is chosen the time goes to 17,000 seconds. The update does not load ever after leaving the that time go by.There were a few problems with the installation, but that's not unusual with many products. The one-touch features are a waste of programing."
5,Amazing and crushing,"I had the honor of meeting Mr. Blatt when he spoke to my Holocaust literature class. He is one of the most quietly impressive men you could ever meet. His story is excrutiating and astounding. A must read for Holocaust studies. And really, this is the sort of story Everyone should read to know what sort of men exist - the evil & the brave."
4,excellent modern dub,"This is a very good dub album, getting away from the traditional with some synthasized drum sounds that fit in beautifully with the vibe of the album"
2,Meh,"It kills me when a band I like does this. LTJ has never been terribly original, but it was their mix of punk, ska, and energy that always gripped me before. I am not at all adverse to bands changing as they grow, but the new album is...well, watered down. Fantastic if you want the generic Blink-182/Yellowcard/Fall Out Boy sound that's ever so popular right now. It's just all so ""done before"". If you are looking for ska, I would look elsewhere."
4,dumb people,people who wrote some of the reviews are just plain dumb this cd is less ska but who wants every cd to sound exactly the same right i mean the cd is great even though there are less horns and stuff they just wanted to change there style so that people wouldnt hear the same old stuff.
1,Does not follow commands,"I got this for my daughter for christmas. I told her what to tell the toy (sit, speak, etc) but it did nothing. I thought maybe there was too much noise so we took it in a room with absolute silence and still it did not work (responded but not correctly). I went out and bought new Duracells and still no luck. We turned it on and off, tried my voice, my wife's voice, and my daughter's voice, still no progress. If frustration is your idea of fun buy Scamps."
4,My daughter loves Scamps,I bought this for my daughters 9th birthday. She has been driving me crazy about getting a dog...she loves animals. She fell in love with Scamps. My sister's kids liked him so much she is getting one for them. I would recommend it to anyone. It is quite adorable. :)
4,good for little ones,"We got this toy for our 5 year old son for Christmas, and he absolutely loves it. It really is very cute, and it even has sensors on it's back and ears so it knows when you are petting it and can respond to you. You can ""teach"" it a few commands and it is quite entertaining for a 5 year old, but I wouldn't reccomend it if your child is over 8 - it just doesn't do enough stuff to hold their attention."
5,This man is a genius,"How can you go wrong when a book talks about the problems of miserliness, envy, hatred, treachery, rancor, malice, arrogance, covetousness, lust, and how to overcome them. I recommend this book to Non-Muslims as well as Muslims. Even an Atheist can benefit from it. We humans are weak by nature and if we are not given guidance, we will definitly go astray. There is no such thing as a man or woman without desires and we will not be able to control them unless someone tells us how to.The book of Allah(GOD) is the only book that can do it. Not the Bible, which does not forbid wrong and immorality like the Quran does. Look at the disobedience of kids in the US to their parents and look how much smut is on the TV. This is a Christian Society and only Islam and can help it. This religion is the final message from God and it is meant to help us understand the purpose of life. Go here if you have any questions about this way of life called Islam [...]"
5,Love it,Motley Crue rocked me in the 80's and I love reading the stories from all the band members. Those were crazy days.
5,A must read for any fan,"This was an awesome book. From how they first started out right up to current, sparing no one, gory details galore. The best writing, hands down, was from Nikki. He exposed more of himself than any other member. Honest and wickedly funny, he really humanized the band and the rock 'n roll lifestyle. If you are a fan, read this book."
3,My 2 Cents,I think the information contained in this book is all great - except that the chapters & timelines seem jumbled and hard to keep track of.
1,trash,"If you are old enough to remember these guys when they were in thier prime, the things that were funny and impresive sure sound stupid and classless now at 45 years old. Perhaps they are running out of money and selling books sounded like an idea? I couldnt get past the first chapter."
4,Fun Read,Fun read if you are a guy. I can't imagine many girls liking this book but I'm sure some are out there. Pretty much exactly what you would expect from a rock band. Not the most intelligent writing in the world but if you are reading this then you aren't looking for that. Read it over a 3 day weekend at the beach.
5,Them bad boys of Rock!,"I grew up with Motley Crue so naturally I had to read their book. Wow! When I got this book I couldn't put it down, even when my eyes were burning and telling me it's time to sleep. I loved the way it was written and how each member filled a chapter or two on their memories of struggling, hitting many down falls and then making it big. Oh the stories that unfold in this book, make me still love them till this day. If you are a die hard Motley fan....do get it!"
5,An Entertaining Book - read if you want to be a rockstar.,"Neil Strauss does an excellent job of drawing out detailed stories with the feel, emotion and passion of Motley Crue. This should be mandatory reading for any young rock band who is about to hit the road. This could be YOU! You end up loving the Crue more or wanting to smack them for plain stupidity and arrogance. He shows the frustration of Mick Mars, the permanent chips on the shoulders of Nikki Sixx, and Vince Neil, and the somewhat charmed but challenged life of the groups most talented member, Tommy Lee. Worth the read if you wanted to know what it was like to be a rockstar in the 80's."
5,MotleyCrue true stories,I had been looking for this as a gift for my son. I was thrilled when I saw it availableon Amazon. It was delivered in a timely manner in pristine condition. The gift wasan enormous hit. Thanks.......
5,"Insight to the vulgar, dirty lives of Motley Crue","I found The Dirt to be a riveting read, but it is not for the faint of heart. It is vulgar, filled with decadent stories about sex, drugs and rock and roll. It is a powerful story taking you to the deepest darkest parts of rock and roll. I wouldn't recommend it for kids - it is for mature audiences only. Despite all of that, I enjoyed every bit of it."
4,The Care and Feeding of Indigo Children,"I am a teacher of Metaphysics and bought this book discover more about my own child and other children that I teach and also ended up discovering a few things about myself. I love the way Doreen has children interview other children to get their full and honest views on their lives and how they deal with them. Who better for a child to console with, but another child. This is a very easy to read book and flow smoothly from one subject to another. I think this is a great first book to start reading about Indigos because it really gives a good background and foundation for the world that you are about to open your eyes to."
1,Skip it,"Indigo is another word for ADD or ADHD and, in the end, this book offers NO solutions or assistance of any kind. It is an insulting and ignorant look at what so many families are struggling with and sends the underlying message, ""You're doing it all wrong.""Don't buy this book and don't waste any time thinking you are a lazy, incapable parent because you can't solve ADD or ADHD. Instead, look for real resources and doctors who can help you and your family."

5,Am I cool or crazy for being the first EVER to rate these scrumptious candy bars?,"Since I'm DEFINITELY not trying to be cool, You can now call me Mr. Crazy Top-Top. Don't forget any parts now!What can I say? Kit Kats have always been pleasing to millions of tongues around the U.S. and sometime, even outside of it! This included my tongue too of course!These things are even better than Snickers Bars (too chewy and full of mouth-rotting caramel and Reese's Peanut Butter Cups (too Peanut Buttery at times).They're JUST RIGHT. Crisp, chocolate-y, without overdoing it and very melts-in-your-mouth-like.Can say much else!Cover Art: D+Taste: ALook: B-Texture: C4.75 stars.Overall: A+"
2,A Step Back From The Early Numa Records Era,"This CD is an American version of ""Metal Rhythm"" where IRS salted the effort with a few tracks from ""Berserker"" which had not seen the light of day in the US yet. The overall thrust is a step away from the more vital albums he had just made for his own label. The program here sounds a tad influenced by his former collaborator Robert Palmer. The opener, ""This Is Emotion,"" sounds more than a little like ""Addicted to Love!"" ""Cold Metal Rhythm "" and ""New Anger"" provide the best tracks here, apart from the brilliant ""My Dying Machine"" remix by William Orbit! The latter track really shows up the lesser material here, big time. The mix by Orbit is one of his typically stellar technological workouts. ""Voix"" and ""America"" provide a strong enough ending but on the whole, this album sounds either like boredom setting in or that IRS was meddling with the sauce. The latter is more probable at this point."
4,Scamps Fur Real Dog,"My son will love this dog. It was in beautiful condition and I was happy with the transaction using a private seller. I was a bit nervous about what the condition was going to be, but he looks brand new in the box and my son will be very happy at Christmas."
5,Nuwave 20322 Pro,I really love this oven. You can delay start. It is fast and the kitchen never gets hot. Would definitely recommend it for the money. Oh the clean up is so easy and no splatters or grease on my stove or countertop. Love it!
3,nu wave,Very easy to clean. Great for a small family or if you need extra oven space when company is over.
5,Really does what it says..,"Well, like most people I was a bit unsure about the claims about the nuwave oven. My wife, however was more skeptible than me. So the first time I used it, I really wanted the Nuwave oven to deliver the goods. And well.. let's just say my wife is now a beliver! I cooked a 4lb Pork Roast a few days ago. I just basically seasoned it, set the timer for 1hr 15 mins or so, and like clock work, the Pork Roast was moist, had a nice crust on the outside ( I rubbed it with Olive Oil) and just down right perfect!I have cooked other meals in it too, but I won't bore you with the details.The main thing is that the NuWave oven does what it says. They ask you if you want to buy (2) when you call and order it. I said no, because I didn't know if it was a hoax. Now I wish I had purchased the 2nd one for the reduced price. So, do I recommend it? You betch cha! :)"
2,Stopped working after 3 years.,"I bought the black digital new wave 3 years ago. I have an older white convection oven ( similar idea of circulating hot air but no infrared.) I like this product because it cooks frozen hamburger really well. Nicely brown and juicy inside. I seldom cook and if I do, I use the stove or my built in conventional GE oven. During the summer I use my green egg grill. So this product was not heavily used. This year it stopped working. I called the company and they said I need to buy a new head for about $80.00. I paid upwards of $150.00 for this. I will throw it away and not buy a new head. The quality is not that good. In comparison, my old convection oven still works. I am very disappointed with this product's quality.I will not recommend wasting your money on this one."
2,Bachmanns N scale ATSF GP-40,"I had already had one, but I purchased the ""Thunder Valley"" starter set, marked down after Christmas. Unfortunatly, the GP-40 would not run, due to whatevercauses. Although a great loco, I did want it repaired. This is unusual for Bachmann for a product to slip through with problems. I sent it off to Bachmann, who did acknowlege the arrival of same via e-mail. Four to six weeks they tell me.We shall see."
5,Nice skirt - but do order a smaller size,"Thanks to the previous reviews I ordered this skirt a size smaller. I like the feel of the fabric, and the flared hemline adds just that bit extra interest. Glad I ordered a smaller size - not sure if this is meant to be a waist line skirt, but with a smaller size it is lowline for me at the hips. Pleased with this purchase."
1,ripoffs,"boring. i've given them a couple of listens, and there's nothing great about them. they should just stay in mexico."
5,This is the best CD they have made!!,I love all their music especially this CD. I hope they keep on making all their music this good!!
2,It could have been good,"The writing and characters aren't bad, but almost every premise is silly. The major premise is that an artificial intelligence with DNA computing elements will go through puberty. Snails have DNA too - why doesn't the DNA based computer grow a shell? And it doesn't advance the story - Asimov, Binder, Ryan, Heinlein, etc. all managed robot/computer coming-of-age stories without such stupid gimmicks. The movie Toy Story doesn't make the mistake of claiming that Buzz Lightyear's existential crisis comes because he's made of carbon.The mimor premises are generally bad, too - as an aside, viruses are blamed for a plague, because alien bacteria wouldn't effect people - but that's backwards. Most bacteria can survive without a host - no virus can. etc.If you're in the mood for a depressing book, you might like this one if you know little of science or technology. Otherwise try something like Blood Music or The Sheep Look Up (they're better written, too)."
5,graduation,"I bought this dress for my daughter whose graduation from secondary school is on this coming july. I Know I bought it in plenty of time but when you see a bargain you take it. It arrived over here to Ireland yesterday and it is fabulous. I would get nothing over here as good and for such a good price. I got it in the sale and when converted it cost 56 euro and 30 euro postage over. What a bargarin....... My daughter is trilled with it. The colour is fab the material is of high quality and the shape and make is fantastic. She also got a wrap for her shoulders included in the price. Would highly recomend this dress for a school graduation,"
4,"Nice qualtiy for the price, not the right fit for me","I was surprised by the quality for the Price. I ended up returning this one and ordering the strapless 50's style from the same vendor.I Ordered the Medium because I fell in the middle of the measurements. 26"" waist, 40"" hip (not an issue as the dress flairs at the hip) and 36"" or 34DD bust. The top of the dress wasn't full enough to cover me in the top. The waist fit nice, just a bit of room to breath. I didn't have time for alterations or would have exchanged for a size up.The crystal pin is of nice quality."
5,Great Bridesmaid's Dress,"I am getting married and needed 2 dresses for my bridesmaids. I had no luck in department stores, they just added more stress to me. I got my wedding dress on line and it fit perfect. So I convinced my bridesmaids to do the same. The dresses came in a timely manor and they fit perfect. JUST MAKE SURE YOU VIEW THE SIZING CHART!! It is diffrent from going to a normal store, the sizing is a bit on the small side, so go a size up(ex: if size: 16 which would normally be a XL, get a size 1X/2X. Promise, it will fit perfect. The gowns are beautiful, I recommend these dresses for plus size women because they make you look smaller than what you really are!! I also got my ringbearer his outfit from this company and his fits perfect also!! Highly recommend this company. Love it!!"
2,Not complete!,"The Kularnava Tantra is a medieval text from at least the end of the thirteenth century, when it was mentioned in the list of texts written by the scholar Lakshmidhara.Although it is primarily a classical text, it includes critiques of Vedic knowledge and scholarly pride frequently seen in the folk and devotional Tantric traditions.As much as I respect Mr. Woodroffe it has to be stated that he made a partial translation of the Kularnava Tantra, rephrasing & censoring many of its anti-Vedic statements.From his translation, one would imagine the text to largely support the Vedic and Sanskritic philosophical tradition."
5,Great,"I bought this as a gift, it came fast and looks beautiful. The barometer was a little difficult to fill, but looks great great when it's all together"
4,Pretty cool,"This is a pretty cool little thing to give as a gift or to have around the house as it comes with a little history lesson and it is always fun to share little facts with those who are curious enough to ask. However, it is pretty finicky and a little messy when a storm is headed, as the liquid in the globe rises and lowers with the weather it's acuracy is amazing, but it often boils over onto the surface that it comes on and so you need to keep a rag or papertowel around it which kinda takes away from the ""decorativness"". It is a cool thing to have around though and if you don't mind a little mess. Also, i suggest a small amount of super glue or hot glue on the base of the thermometer as when the balls all go to the top it is quite top heavy and doesn't take much for it to fall, luckily our was on a table and was not damaged but if it were on a mantle this problem would have been quite a bit more upsetting."
4,Fun Science!,"Great to share with the kids. I was especially attracted to the weighted globes in the tube. My 9 year old niece loves it and wants one of her own.The instructions that come with it don't make it clear just how many syringes full it takes to bring water to the appropriate level. A previous poster was right: about three will do it. Note that you will need to provide your own dye for the spouted globe once you've filled it. It never occurred to me until I opened the box. Since I haven't dyed any eggs for years, a quick trip to the grocery store was in order.Overall though, I'm very pleased."
3,NICE BUT NOT THAT ENTERTAINING,THERMOMETER WAS CUTE BUT TOO SMALL AND YOU HAVE TO DO TO MUCH WORK TO MAINTAIN IT. I RETURNED IT. JUST WASNT WHAT I EXPECTED..............
4,Lightweight and looks great...but a tad noisy,"These shoes look great and feel good. They're lightweight so it's easy to walk around in them. My only complaint (and perhaps it will fade as the shoes are worn in a while longer) is that the shoes make a soft, but certainly audible noise with each step. I'm conscious of it and it's slightly irritating, particularly as I do not recall my last pair of dress shoes starting off like this. Again, hopefully it's just a temporary thing as I love everything else about these shoes."
5,Just Love It!,"I just bought Elizabeth taylor's three perfumes: White Diamond, Violet Eyes, and Passion. I like all three but Passion has an amazing scent. It's spicy and lightly floral. It's become one of my favorites. I wish I tried it sooner."
2,Not very helpful,"I loved Drew's other book, Cracked, and was hoping for some useful information about Oxycontin in here. I do take this drug periodically and was wondering about some of the more odd side effects (hearing issues, sleep disturbances, overheating, and anxiety), and basically just wanted to know all about it from the guy who knows it all. Unfortunately, almost none of the book is about Oxycontin. It mostly details the addiction process and the various detox treatments. Worse, only the very first section is actually written by Drew (!), so this book is a tease if you're even partly in it for him.I gave it a 2 since it does offer some interesting factoids about the history of prescription pain meds, but overall I would not recommend this book. Don't judge it by its dramatic cover that makes it sound like you're in for a useful experience. This is more like a dry, impersonal, and uninteresting version of ""Cracked."""
1,Doesn't clean well,"I've owned this pan for about three years. I loved it at first--it distributes heat well and food cooks evenly. What I've grown to hate is cleaning this pan. I purchased it for oven-roasting vegetables using a small amount of oil. It's very hard to clean the oil from the pan, and the finish has become badly stained. I never feel it's really clean. What a disappointment!I don't plan to purchase any more Calphalon cookware after owning this pan. The pan's now sitting in the garage...next step is to be a Goodwill donation..."
3,A little disappointed,"I purchased my first pair of these suede shoes at a retail store and I was pleased to find a replacement pair available on Amazon. While the shoes are exactly what I wanted, they were permeated with the odor of mothballs. Despite airing them in the garage for several days it continues to linger somewhat."
4,Great compact refrence for E-C dictionary,"I came across this in my library, and have used it repeatedly since. It's a great simple English-Chinese dictionary, if you want something compact with the most important everyday words listed. Good for beginning to intermediate students, definately. My only complaint is actually the price, which I consider too expensive for what it is. However, I read somewhere that the proceeds go to build rural schools in China, so maybe it is warrented. The dictionary uses pinyin and traditional characters (which is wonderful), and includes about 8 VERY specialized sub-dictionaries (nuclear power generation, insurance, etc.). All in all well recommended."
4,Does What It Supposed to Do,"This cable release does what it claims, no more, no less. I use it for an e-1; it can also be used for the newer e-3. Unfortunately, a different model has to be used for all other Olympus 4/3 cameras (a USB cable release). I wish Olympus had standardized on one or the other, but they're no different from other camera manufacturers in this respect. Otherwise, cable release seems well-made."
2,"Every product excelent , but por quality for jockey products","i liked the producs , leather jacket ,shoes, t Shirt. .Idid not like the underware jockey , for the poor quality of these products , y know jockey class because in the 1970 and 1980 y use to be whoseler of jockey colombia."
3,Disappointed,The cut of leg holes in the classic briefs was higher than pictured or expected.I mght have to return them.
5,"Good fit, Good Price","I've tried just about all of the mainstream underwear brands out there over the years (and as a middle aged man, that's a lot of years!), both in boxers and briefs, and I keep coming back to Jockey's Classic Brief. I have a long torso relative to my height (think long torso, short legs) and am a little bit overweight, and I find that other men's brands ride too low for my comfort or are ""too tight"" down low.Jockey's Classic Briefs fit well, ride well, the cotten they're made of is good quality, and overall they're very comfortable. And when it comes to underwear, comfort is 90 percent of the game. Add in the fact that they're pretty inexpensive to boot, especially when buying the 6-pack, and it adds up to a recommended buy. Granted, they're not the sexiest things out there, but since I'm not an underwear model, I can live with that. :-)"
5,Old Style Cuba,"The music on this CD is all original, yet some the songs are from the turn of the century. My grandmother (from cuba) tells me that some of these songs are from the times of her great grand parents. The songs were revised for the changed times, in some songs talking about the revolution and Castro. But the music is the good, old jazz, with strong and powerful, yet romantic vocals. A must buy for any Cuban music fan."
3,GOOD STRATEGY BOOK,"Provided a lot of strategies that helped ease some nerves. This book tells you how to think through questions, eliminate the wrong answers instead of looking for the right one was the most important lesson learned. This book however lacked the number of questions. I used this book and the Saunder's Comprehensive Review book to study for the NCLEX-RN exam and am happy to report that I passed the exam on one try."
1,Kaplan 2005-2006,"The book promises you 180 questions and another 180 question on the CD. Well, CD does not work. How is this possible? It was made in 1998 no wonder my XP doesn't know what to do with it. SCUM !!"
2,I'm so DIZZY!!,"I sell music DVDs and I have to agree with the 1 star because of the fact the camers would not stop at one person. I was so dizzy after I watched the DVD I had a migrain! if you can handle being on a boat feeling sick, go for it. By the way the sound was good."
4,Good Purchase for a Scorps/Metal Fan,"I own both the DVDs for Acoustica and Moment of Glory. This DVD is not as good as those two. The film footage is not as impressive, not as well put together and the footage could have been recorded better but the horrible reviews on here are totally unfounded. The footage still captures the raw energy of the band (the crowd isn't up to par with the show sadly) live and the sound is great (you can complain about the footage but not about the sound). If you are Scorps fan you will like the subtle changes in the Zoo. I have heard a number of live versions (from cds/dvds and in concert) of this Scorpions staple and I really really like this version. Deep and Dark live also sounds great. I would recommend this DVD to a Scorpions fan and to a metal fan. If you are neither, then this might not be for you!"
5,The best money saver going,We have a large family found out we are saving a lot of money doing our cards this way. We love personalizing them and it fills my creative needs.
3,MOW is a decent book lacking a good plot summary,"I felt that this book was very impressive and the richness of it's concepts is extraordinary. The first part of the book is the best, but the second half of the book becomes redundant and the plot is delayed. I recommend the Mars series that Kim Stanley wrote earlier, they are much more interesting."
1,Our Town - Reel Classic Films,Extremely poor video reproduction. If I had known I never would have purchased this. You have been warned!
1,Horrendous DVD Transfer,"I'm going to have to agree with the other reviewers here -- the quality of this DVD transfer of the classic 1940 movie ""Our Town"" is horrific. It looks like someone taped it off a vhs tape that someone else taped off a grainy tv channel. Most of the scenes have white bursts of light all over them, as though they were filtered through an image of the stars in a night sky. The sound is also scratchy and almost distorted. Unfortunately, there are no subtitles to even aid in understanding the dialog. I'm not even going to bother describing the movie -- avoid this print at all costs."
4,"""Here We Go Again........""","As Archie Bell & The Drells once sang! Another quality Philly soul lp that didn't make the (national attention) squad at time of ""try-outs"". Nevertheless, with ""Look At All The Lonely People"" leading the way, another quality album a music company in a foreign land has had the insight and wherewithal to get on disc, now availible to all, that no U.S. music company has, prior to now. Know the former Temptation in the group? For sweet soul/soul collectors familiar with the known, many excellent ""not well known"" reissue lps finally arriving to market. Treat yourselves, it's buy time!"
4,Great DVD but wrong camera,I am a big fan of Israel and New Breed and I am so glad that they had the stage set up on the Live From Another Level:The Video.The DVD was great and the musicians were great as well.But the camera were moving too much and it was shaking round.But it was great!
3,Israel and New Breed: Live From Another Level - The Video,"solo se puede apreciar lo que Israel canta, los coros y los musicos se escuchan muy bajos. Esperaba mas contenido en los extras o en los special features."
4,Razorback is wrong...this is a WONDERFUL book!!!,"I won't bore you with the details of the story, as all of the previous reviewers have already given you that information. Suffice it to say that this is a beautiful book that left me wanting to know more about the fate of the main characters. (I've already put the ""sequel"" on my Wish List for my next order from ... ) I really enjoyed it, as did a number of my friends. A perfect ""beach"" read for those so inclined (I live in the Pacific so every day is a good day for a beach read) or a good read for a rainy day or a nice cozy day in front of the fireplace. I really liked this book. Razorback should put her ""razor"" away...."
3,Easy Reading,"I finished reading this book in one day. It was a good book for teen agers, becauseit was easy reading and interesting. Nice discriptions and believable situations.I look forward to the sequal."
4,Wonderfully written and interesting tale..........,"At first blush, I thought this was a sweet, simple summer read, but having finished it I can safely say it is so much more than that. It is deeply moving, wonderfully written, and fascinating in its exploration of women in China in the early 20th century.As the reader follows the story of Pei, a young girl born to a poor farming family who is sent to the ""big city"" to become a silkworker, we learn of the constant struggles and hardships faced by women in Chinese society at this time, where it was much more adventageous and acceptable to send a female child away to work and reap the benefit of her income, than to have her at home with the family and face shame from the community. Her story is one of hope, love, tenderness, and loss, and it will continue to follow you long after the book is closed.I highly recommend this novel to everyone, especially those with interest in womens' issue, Chinese society, the early 20th Century, or silkworkers."
5,Tsukiyama book,Beautiful book about the Silk trade in China prior to the invasion of Japan. Writer's parents are Japanese and Chinese.
4,"helpful and encouraging, but mostly for jazz pianists","very helpful ideas and yoga practices. however, he must have mentioned that the relaxation exercises and meditation processes are directly taken from yoga. I was expecting more classical piano emphasis, but overall, there are many ideas that classical pianists can use as well. I would have one criticism to the main idea in the book: that of letting your fingers doing the playing and the mind enjoying the music from the space above... this is very dangerous for classical piano. that was how I used to play when I was an adolescent and suffered great mishaps in concerts when the mind kept coming back and forth.. of course he means being completely well rehearsed in order to have the mind float above, but still classical piano requires constant control ... AND being able to enjoy it simultaneously. The enjoyment comes by itself anyhow when one has complete control and has internalized the music."
5,Nadirah tells it like it is,"Nice to know Artist are not afraid to tell it like it is....as with Nadirah's song ""Break Away""."
2,Wrong edition,"The book is in ok conditions, has some writting on it and some wear and tear, but it is the wrong edition."
1,Tomato or Strawberry?,"I couldn't tell if these were tomatoes or strawberries, so I ordered Just Tomatoes Just Strawberries, 4-Ounce Tub, and I'm not sure what I got. Whatever they are, there's none of that sweet juicy fruity goodness you find in both strawberries and tomatoes. They should call these...Just Something Dried Up That Just Used to be Fruit or something like that."
5,it works good,"I had 3 old comps that are roughly 10 years old just sitting around so I figured I'd take them apart and make a frankenstien comp to use to down load things and do stuff that might give me a virus. After taking all the good parts out of the comps and making one better one I stuck the card in and boom, worked like a charm. The frankenstein is running xp service pack 3 and I havent had an issue yet. definitely recommended."
5,Startech Fast Enet Network Card,"This Card is great it worked out of the box installation in less than 3 minutes,Turn on my computer and I have a fast ethernet port.Windows recognized the card immediatly and it's working for about two weeks now no problem.It's a very nice card with a great price."
1,Not worth the time,"This thing was little better than very poorly written gay porn, barely a notch above slash fic. I could have written it myself. Please, save your money!"
3,Interesting,"The movie is fairly new and it does give a good account of what being a female in the Israeli Border Police in Jerusalem must be like, but it is missing something. The story is very dry and uneventfull."
2,It's Aiight,"I mean it just doesnt capture the essence of the Twelve play and TP2 at all its almost like he just ran out of songs...Dont get me wrong there are a few cuts on the there that i like, but keyword is ""few""...Its not like the others where you can listen to the whole cd...Its just too urban in my opinion. It isn't R&B. He has reggaeton on it..i dont understand nothing what them cats rapping about..I guess he trying something new...but give me that TP2..or Twelve Play...you know that classic R.Kelly."
3,"R.Kelly-You either like the guy,or you hate him.","My title pretty much sums up my review-you either like the guy,or you hate him!"
1,TP.3.COM RELOADED NEED TO EMPTY IT'S CLIP!,"This is the weakest album in R Kelly's catalog. This album much like many of the reviewers say. It's nothing but a product of pure sex without any substance nor much inspiration. With it's unimaginative sexual themes dominating the album, it feels more like a poorly written erotic thriller or your typical porno movie for that matter.For sex starved teenagers going through puberty, this album will be of interest to them. But for a grown and mature audience, this album is juvenile and immature.R.Kelly need to find some meaningful inspiration and rebound in a major way on his next release. Otherwise he's going to keep making albums like this.Pass on this disc. You can get better smut out of a Playboy Magazine."
2,I don't get all the hype,"I'm sorry, but I don't see what all the hype is about on R.Kelly's album. The only song I bang on occassions is ""Playas Only"" w/Game. The rest of the album is trash to me. The ""Trapped In The Closet"" series was old and played out before the album was even released. Maybe if I was a sex addict I would be able to relate to the album more w/ songs like ""Sex In The Kitchen."" WTF? My food is made in a damn kitchen, I would hope no sex took place in the same spot. A know tha Brotha was tryna express his feelings, but damn, calm down a lil bit. For now, i'm sticking with my opionion of the album being trash. The only reason I bought the album was because my computer was down and I wanted to see what all the hype was about."
2,I Should Have Read These Reviews B4 I Bought This Disc!!!,"I personally think R Kelly is an overall good songwriter and a pretty darn good singer. ""Trapped In The Closet"" is very cool but..I DON'T LIKE MY MUSIC TO BE AS GRAPHIC AS THE MUSIC ON THIS CD IS!!!! I don't smoke, I ain't a ""playa"" and I believe sex is a special thing. Smokin, sexin' etc...is not my thing at all. This CD is not what I thought is was and after listening ...it's not what I think it could have been!!! If there is a follow-up without the ""Parental"" sticker, I will buy that one. Until then, this CD will sit in my collection until I get the strength to throw it out. $14.96 out the window!!!"
1,I can't believe what music has come to!,"These songs are so bad. He is so disrepectful of women in all of his songs and treats them like sexual objects!He used to sing good and be respectful but now he is a regular in court, acts as if women are just objects with no feelings that he can just have sex with, and sings bad!This is by far the worst cd ever!Why do people buy music from a man who doesn't respect women for who they are, treats them like objects, and has music that is ethically wrong in every way!Please get a clue, people!R. Kelly is so immature that hegoes to the extremes by only singing about sex and acting like women don't have any dignity!R. Kelly, you should be shamed of yourself!You need to get a life you over-ego-sized *****!"
2,Making Too Many Albums,"and it shows because R.Kelly is not putting the effort into his recordings like he used to. I know he has legal fees to pay, but fans don't like a rush job and this cd sounds like rush job. ""In The Closet"" is the only reason why you should buy this cd because the other songs are just plain sad."
4,"""SEX WEED"" is AWESOME, this whole CD is another trophy for R. Kelly","THIS CD IS HOT. I LOVE IT, LOVE IT. Love It.. R. Kelly is never a disappointment and I am absolutely SHOCKED at some of the Low reviews!!! But that's what makes us individuals :o) ""SEX WEED"" is just the best, HOTTEST song I've hear (of that genre) in a long long long long time. ""Kickin' It With Your Girlfriend"" is Hot, ""Slow Wind"" HOT- Reminds me of when I was in Jamaica, the man is tellin the truth! The whole CD is just hot.. But I agree, the Trapped In The Closet is now old, but the CD itself is definitely RELOADED! (I give it 4 Stars on Principle. All he talks about is Sex. Where to do it. How to do it. How often to do it. Who to do it with. What it reminds him of. What it feels like. What it sounds like. What it smells like. What it relates to. I mean, He does it well, obviously because I think the CD is a success, but still...)"
5,Really good book,"This book is very well written and entertaining and a completely unexpected view of the Lewis and Clark expedition. At some points in the book, I forgot that the story was being told by the dog and felt like I was listening to first hand memories of one of the humans on this trip. Even those who are not very interested in history will find this book enjoyable and fun."
4,Out of the Mouth of Dogs.,I haven't had time to read this story. I am anxious to do so. It looks as though it could be informative as well as a good story. I'm looking forward to reading it.
3,ThCaptain's Dog,It was an interesting book. Well written. I generally enjoy historical fiction like this. It could have been a bit longer.
5,Adorable and absolutely gorgeous.,I absolutely loved this little piece. I like the tiny little details on the handle. I also loved the little black velvet pouch it came with. Totally worth the money!I will watch out for the other previous reviewer on how it bends over time.
1,Major disappointment,"This is the first Amazon book I've ever returned, but I did so in a heartbeat. Despite the long list of online sites - as advertised - there was no useful information on preparing a resume for online submission, despite a whole ""chapter"" on the subject (6 pages, actually). There is not a single reference to the use of keywords in your resume, strategies for tailoring a resume for companies who insist on online / electronic submission, beyond the trivial ""use an asterisk for a bullet""...If you're only looking for sites to submit your resume to, I suppose this would be useful. But if you want guidance as to how to help your resume rise to the top of the electronic stack, this book is a waste of money."
5,Great for Thomas fans.,"The granddaughter is three years old and a fan Thomas Train. She was still, enter-trained and happy to see it again and again."
3,Compelling but disturbing,"I admit from the get-go that I couldn't put it down. It is wonderfully written and the story line pulls you in right away. However, I found this book in the youth section, and there are parts of this book that are very adult. It is, simply, a coming-of-age book, complete with first mensturation, fondling, rape and finally sex (more than once). I tried to look over that because I was so drawn by the story, but then I was just frustrated by the end of the book. Many questions are left unanswered, and the reader is left to draw conclusions for which you're not prepared.I commend the writer for the beautiful story-telling, but this story could have taken a slightly different direction with the ending, giving more hope. You feel just a little lost at the end, not sure if something good or bad just happened and the slightly uneasy feeling that the bad thing will probably happen again."
3,A dark fairy-tale...,"One day, a foundling is discovered on the edge of the village of Little Wicken, the night after a storm. The young girl grows up to be Mokie, which means ""pig girl"". Without a true family, Mokie feels safest when she is with the pig herd, especially when she's deep in Wickenwood, the mysterious forest that's nearby. It's not until Mokie bonds with Apple, the 13th baby pig of a sow, who also happens to be born during a storm, that Mokie experiences many emotions for the first time. A rape scene marks the turning point for Mokie, for she flees with Apple in Wickenwood and eventually meets up with a trio of supposed gypsies. The details in this book were great, and the whole fairy tale felt like it was written more for grownups. A couple of times I got a bit lost with what the ""gypsies"" were talking about, but for the most part, it was a good first book by the author."
3,"Not the best, but...","...it's good as a fill-in. The series seems to be drawing too slow, and there could be too many books written before they hit the end of the L5R Clan War storyline. Great work was done with Tadaka but too little with the others and their corruptions. And contrary to popular belief, namely victor_kuo, the L5R product line is not being ended. Rather it is being sold, and rumors are all pointing to Alderac, who owns the RPG, Clan Wars miniatures and who have contributed much to the L5R history. I'm eagerly waiting for the Crab novel and hope it comes on time. Anyway, as the story of Isawa Tadaka this book is fantastic. As the story of the Phoenix it lacked. Much too similar to the Scorpion novel. While it worked for the Scorpion, as the Coup was essentially the story of Bayushi Shoju, it fails at the Phoenix. At least the fan fics can have some character development to play off of. Definitely a drop from the best book in the series, The Crane."
3,"Minor Damage, works as designed","Rack delivered on time.Rack had a defect on one of the feet. A piece about 2 inches had split away. This did not impact the functionally of the product however, a little wood glue and two clamps over night.... Problem solved. We also added felt feet to the rack to avoid any scratcing of the wood floorsRack looks great, but keep in mind this is not made out of a hardwood. Straps appear to be solid and fastened securlty with a staple."
2,Straps are too far apart,"The product is attractive enough, but the straps are too far apart to provide good support for a small bag."
4,Luggage Racke,"Attractive, great for guest bedroom. Seems sturdy enough for most bags. Price was right."
3,A bit episodic,"I received this book as a gift from my wish list, and I was eager to read it. I found it did contain some interesting information, especially about places visited for the accompanying television series. As a history book, on its own merit, I found it too episodic. It was a lot like reading the narration for the series, with no elaboration and no additional information. If you are interested in Ireland's ancient history and prefer to read coherent narrative, I would recommend you choose another book."
5,First Time use a Success!,"I purchased the Slime 1034-A T-Handle Tire Plug Kit to plug a hole in riding lawn mower tire. I had never plugged a tire before, but followed the instructions and it was a success. Hardest part was finding the small hole that caued the leak, but thin instructions even had a solution for that. Great item well worth the money. Highly recommended."
4,everything she wanted......,"My 10 year old granddaughter,lives, dreams in animal, dogs most of all.she saw this on a kids site and wanted it...told me 4 weeks before Christmas.I looked everywhere.found it thru here.......she loves it has stopped playing her other monpoly games and uses this one only thank you.was there in time, before it was to be, and everything she wanted"
3,Slighty fabricated.,"Well, the reason I put that in the title, is because the pictures show that you get a cat, mailman, hydrant, etc for pieces.However, we did not get those when we ordered this. What we got were colored wooden bowls.I'm not terribly upset, just slightly miffed that the seller lied.Anywho, it looks fun!"
3,"So corny, but hey, better than regular Monopoly","So corny, but hey, better than regular Monopoly with all its unveiled greed and opportunism.Have you noticed that it is always safe to talk about dogs?"
4,Addictive,My 10-year-old grandson is in love with this game and (groan) won't let me read my book. What have I done?
3,"Collect ""opoly"" games","My grandson collects ""opoly"" games and especially wanted the Dogopoly. He was pleased to get it for Christmas."
5,A Sweet Treat,"This is the follow up on Sweetie's ""From the Gutter to the Runway"". (Sweetie is a dog who somehow found her way to being a darling mutt of the fashion world.) I really enjoyed that book and was happy to see she had more to say. When it comes to love advice, she seems to have a pretty good-humored head on her shoulders! Very cute. The illustrations are a treat, too! Loved it."
5,the perfect referrence for any medical related personnel,"well updated, organized and best used by all fields of medical related personnel. suitably used as a referrence for medical students and other health sciences students."
4,Info on the harrisons,"It seems like Harrisons text book of internal medicine has a reputation that precedes reading it. I have been encouraged to make it my text book for comming exams, I,would like to know when is the new edition going to be released i'm quite eager to go thru the newer edition. Any one with info on it's approximate date of release please mail me on helloayman@hotmail.com i'd be grateful."
2,Ruffian:Claimer not Champion Movie,I had been looking forward to seeing this movie. I had read the wonderful book Ruffian:Buring from the Start by Jane Schwartz and knew that her story could make a compelling movie even with the sad ending.Instead it was flat and the characters had no real development. The racing scenes were decently done but would have been better without the slow-motion bits chunked in seemingly at random. Sam Shepherd does a good job as trainer Frank Whiteley but the rest of the acting is fairly forgetable.Best thing about the movie is the footage of the real Ruffian that is shown during the ending credits. Skip the movie (other than the credits) and read Jane Schwartz's book.
2,You get what you pay for,What shipped to me was not what was pictured on the website. It was not a straight grey stripe down the front but instead the top headrest area was black. Not a big deal but it really shouldn't be too much to ask to receive what I thought I ordered.Didn't even have to open to box to know that it was a cheap quality material. The material feels plasticky. There is a foam layer under the front of the cover that makes a slight crunching noise. Might as well throw a plastic bag over my car seats.
5,Heaven,"I enjoyed this cd very much! I played it while I sat by my fireplace and it put me in such a romantic mood! I love Gillian Palette's voice! Her voice is so smooth! Her father Frank's sax playing is magnificent, especially on ""No Free Jam."" My favorite song is ""When I Sit Alone."" I played that song over and over. I can't get enough of Frank and Gillian Palette and the Jazz Squad!"
5,Out of their minds,If you are willing to pay close attention and listen to this show at least 20 times you will be richly awarded! The finest hour of comedy. Also great radio music (big band)!
2,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed that this was not the sequel to Daddy Day Care with the same cast. I thought the ""rival"" camp's director was a jerk, big over-grown, spoiled kid who couldn't let the past go. Cuba Gooding was a little too simple for me. My grandson didn't like it as much as Daddy Day Care."
4,Daddy Day Camp - Good Family Movie,My husband and I like to collect movies that we can watch with our grand children when they visit. This is one that we definitely all can enjoy!
3,Okay.,"I bought the study cards thinking that I would conveniently bring them with me everywhere I went so I could maximize my study time. Once I started looking through the cards, they provided pretty good information but I didn't really use them that often. I found the number of cards to be overwhelming and much preferred quiz-style studying from the OT Exam Study Guide (by Johnson). Some of the card information seemed out-of-date and provided too much detail for what the actual exam is testing (more clinical reasoning). If you're looking to get as many study materials as possible, these aren't a bad choice, but if I had to do it all over again I'd save the $40. Definitely get the study guide by Johnson though. It's great."
1,lacks clarity and concision,"This is one more of those books written by college professors that was done so more for the purpose of showing off to the author's colleagues than to be helpful to students. It's very esoteric.(To have 25 years of experience in content analysis doesnot entail being able to get the message across.) The book, as a whole, lacks clarity and concision. The definitions, often, contain words more difficult and abstract than the word being defined. The author's definition of content analysis alone has55 words! Berelson's definition, found on the same page, has only19 and it is much clearer. This is the kind of book that, evenif you're fanatic about content analysis, you end up by readingchapter one entirely, leafing through chapter two, and then finally putting it aside, criticizing yourself for having boughta pig in a poke that cost a lot."
4,Great compact camera!,I bought this camera to take with me on deployment in the Middle East desert. It handled the environment without so much as a hiccup. Picture quality is excellent. I'm very satisfied with this product!
2,Not what I was expecting,"It's not that the book is so bad, it's just that it's not that good. There are too many things left out. Where are the *real* details of how the product works? Where's the coverage of sql-xml? Where's the code showing how to make the server work for you? I was expecting something along the lines of Richter, but got something that feels like it was not written by a real practitioner. After reading this, I doubt that Kalen has any experience in the trenches as they say. Sorry, but I just can't recommend this one."
1,Way too much like the 7.0 book,"I liked the 6.5 version of this book. The 7.0 one was pretty useful too. But theproblem with this one is that its too much like the 7.0 book. I feel like I've just paid for the same book twice. Whole chapters are virtually identical. Why put out a 2000 book if you're not going to cover it fully? Not only should XML be there, but so should federated servers, security, and a host of other things. A real letdown..."
2,Not too inside,"If you compare this book to the other Inside books, you'll find that it's hardly Inside. First and foremost, an Inside book should be comprehensive. This book has holes in it big enough to drive a truck through. The first book - the 6.5 edition - was comprehensive. The problem is: the product has expanded a lot since then. Full text search should be covered. XML should be covered. Replication should be covered. Clustering should be covered. Analysis services should be covered. DTS should be covered. English query should be covered. None of these are. If you have the 6.5 or 7.0 edition of this book, save your money until they update this one a bit more."
1,Not very useful,"This book is heavy enough, but repeats so much of the 7.0 book that it's really not as comprehensive as it might appear or that it should be. There are far too many 2000 topics that are completely absent (not just XML, as some have noted, but also high availability, replication, new data types, new database options, and many others). On top of that, the book is boring. It reads like a very long whitepaper."
2,Lacks most of the things you would expect,"What would you expect in a book titled Inside SQL Server 2000? I'd say:* Discussion of the new data types in SS 2K* Detailed notes on how XML support is implemented internally and what MS plans to do with it in the future* Clustering* Log shipping* All internal details of SS 2KIf, like me, you have these expectations, prepare to be disappointed. None of them are covered in any depth if at all (XML isn't even in the index). If you're in search of the ultimate tome on SS 2K, you'll have to keep searching."
2,Kind of disappointing,"If the SQL Svr 7 book didn't exist, this would be a pretty good book. As it is, though its to much like it. Basically if you have the 7 book, you don't need this one. As other people have pointed out the two are very, very similar. But the book is still a good read if you don't have the version 7 book, its just to bad that there isn't more about SQL Svr 2000 in this one (like xml for example)."
1,Not a good value,"This is too much like SQL Server 7. If it said SQL Server 7 on the cover or just SQL Server, I suppose that would be ok. But it says SQL Server 2000.I agree with the other reviews that say its boring. Its very, very boring - its a tough read. You can't just sit down with it - it will put you to sleep.Also there's no XML info. There should be lots of it. Its just a real disappointment."
5,classic,"This is the epitome of 77 punk rock. This band was on the level of all the greats like the Ramones, Sex Pistols, Clash, etc. but never recieved the regognition that they deserve. This is a truely essential album, so buy it already."
1,Breaks very easy,I was so excited to get this braclet and it broke within 10 days. I really liked the design of the braclet and it was slim and wore on my wrist well but cheap because it broke inhalf within 10 days. Very upset.
3,Fragile,I got this as a gift for my 25th birthday from a dear friend. I love Kokopelli because I am a N.A. Flue player and love the culture as well. I also collect bracelets and bangles. When I received it I bent it to the shape of my wrist and felt like it was going to break. It's beautiful but delicate. This is one I have to be careful with! I'm almost afraid to wear it!
4,Nice set of cards,These cards are great to use everyday to help focus your attention on your spiritual life. I use these in group settings to start conversations.
3,telling stories,It is good reading; but not a manual for songwriting.I recommend it because of the stories and interviews in the booksare worth the money spent on the book.&#8203;
3,It is a book... it does talk about Active Directory,"This is a luke warm approach to Active Directory. I read a lot of great information on Microsoft's TechNet site that did a much better job of addressing AD. This book, however, has a lot of scope, but not much depth.You may want to keep shopping before buying this one."
3,OKish training book but need more for the MCP exam,"I used this book as a primary study source for the Active Directory Exam and found it to be limited in many respects. While it does cover most of the required topics, it can be very light on substance in parts, and leave you bored to tears in other sections. Obviously it was written by a collection of authors and hence there is no real coherence to the book. However that said it is from Microsoft, hence authoritative, and does at least touch on the relevant areas. I would suggest using the resource kit to fill in the gaps, or Alistair G. Lowe-Norris book for better presentation or the subject."
5,2 amazing deliveries1,"I used this in combination with the Earth Mama Angel Baby Getting Labor Started CD. They compliment each other very well. I had planned a natural birth in the hospital and was still almost a month out when my OB told me I was going to be induced. I listened to the Getting Labor Started CD throughout the night and come morning she was willing to let my natural labor progress! It progressed so well that by the time I had noticable contractions and began the Natural Labor Companion CD it was only four hours until my daughters birth. My sons delivery was very fast, only one hour thanks to the Getting Labor Started and Natural Labor Companion!"
2,ball end on high E string broke,"A week or so after I restrung my guitar the ball end (a little piece of cheap plastic) popped-off the high E string. Fortunately I was able to make a big knot on the end and salvage the string. Won't buy these Martin M260 80/20 Bronze Ball End Classical Guitar Strings, Regular Tension strings again."
3,some minor disappointment,Strings are fairly good with a nice feel and sound to them. One of the exploded the ball off the end during the tuning process though--NOT from overtightening as I hadn't even gotten it to pitch yet!--which was a minor irritation. Fortunately I was able to tie it on at the end and make it work. Probably ok for the price though I've never had one pop like that before and I'm not sure what to make of it.
3,Asthetically pleasing BUT...,I purchased this as a gift for my Grandmother for Christmas and she loved it. But within a month she told me that one of the links broke.This is a nice item to have strickly for decoration/display purposes only. The links are not very durable and regularly handling it will inevitably lead to it breaking.Your decision to purchase it should be based on its intended use. Hope this helps.
4,Very nice,"I could see the quality work in this rosary. I was pleased when I opened the container and I could immediately smell olive wood. There was only one thing buyers need to be aware of when buying this item that wasn't mentioned in the description. The Holy Land Sand is present in a compartment on the rosary. In my opinion, this adds to the quality of the rosary so I'm not sure why the seller didn't describe this fact. I'll be looking for more items from this seller."
4,Beautiful,"Very nice photos of the caesar twins. The mixture between fan book and art phots makes fun to watch. The black and white pictures are brilliant, but why they use also colour photos, this is the only question I have.This book has to do with arcrobatic, erotic, dance, beautifil bodies and the story of Twins, what do you want more"
5,excellent info,"This is a must watch for those who approach vaccines with an open mind towards the insane financial incentive the vaccine companies get, with the resulting harm to our kids."
5,N2k3 (Nascar 2003),"I loved all of Papyrus' racing games and always will. First off this game along with most other Papy games are for the decaded racer. Not EA Thunder whatever guys that just enjoy wrecks. This is not a kids game, I know kids who can have fun but it can be frusterating. Now with the Truck and Busch mod out the kiddies can mess with them easier to handle cars. Next thing is, don't bother getting the game if you don't have a half-way decent steering wheel. It's not worth it if you only have a keyboard. Last thing is race single player for a while if your new then try multiplayer :)"
5,TOP DOG IN IT'S CLASS,"This is the cats....., well you know. If you've been a folower of Sierras NASCAR series sims, you will know that this is a good one. The physics are better than the previous version, as are the graphics, but it is kind of a system hog. You should have a high mid-upper end machine to run this sim. The changes probably wouldn't jsutify buying it if you have NASCAR 2002, but if you're thinking of upgrading fron NASCAR Racing 4, it would be a good thing. I think the best enhancements have to be the sun glare, and track grime on the windshield. Too bad this is the last one. :("
1,overcharged?,"im sure the sim is a very fine one! but i dont think its right that i order it ahead of due date so i can get it as soon as possible ,,only to see that on the due date the price droped 10 $,,,,,,,,hmmmm concidering i bought one day shipping,,,,i should have atleast got the sim on due day or very next day with the one day shipping i bought,,,not happen!! i see that im out 60$ on something i could have drove 12 miles for ,,an for almost half price!!! ok ,,am i the big dummy here,,,or is it just another way u big companys bleed another dollar from someone???"
4,Does the job,"I usually have the most basic of LED tire gauges, so this one is fancy for me. The backlit display is a good thing to have. The light at the tip is more of a glow. Turns off automatically after a minute or two. Good buy for the price."
4,Works as intended,"Looks good, LED works well at night. Lights up the nozzle area pretty well. Display screen is also adequately bright for night usage. Snout fits well into the tire nozzle. I have used it on a 2010 camry as well as a 2000 Accord, worked well. Readings are quick and the display can be toggled b/w PSI and 2 other units (fgot what they were). Auto shut off feature works so far. Recommended to couple of my friends as well and they are pretty happy as well."
3,A useful book on technical delivery,"Preachers and public speakers will find this book useful. Fasol discusses the body language and pathos aspects of communication by giving the principles of proper vocal production and articulation, effective facial expression, eye contact, posture, gestures, etc. This book is written with preachers in mind, but certainly any public speaker would find it effective for bringing to mind these often-forgotten areas of communication. I don't think the title of the book (""Complete Guide..."") is entirely accurate, but it is a helpful book none the less."
5,just wonderful,Convenient - with or without the clip. Protects my Q and its screen. Unobstructed access to both soft keys and other ports. I can easily answer the phone after the first ring. Looks good as well. Excellent service by vendor.
4,One of the more underrated J.T./Heartbreakers Recordings,"If you can find the 10"" version of this, go for that. This is definately a band that sound better on vinyl. And the vinyl on my copy is pink! However, I'm sure it is almost as great on any other format. ""Love Comes..."" is the best cut on the album, and this is one of the better versions of ""Chinese Rocks"" I've heard. Highly recommended!"
2,This Suet is messy,"HUGE mess - I have used this suet for the past year and do not plan to re-order. The birds do eat it and like it, but this product is greasy and contaminates the smaller birds feathers. and bathing does not clean it off. It also a melty-mess to clean the gooey leftovers out of the wire feeder. I much prefer the no melt blend by Pennington, though the cost id higher. Manufaturer needs to add more fiber to the mix to reduce grease & mess."
2,Pan leaks now,"I did not purchase this pan on Amazon, but I am on Amazon looking for a replacement. I've used this pan on and off for almost 9 years, but it's leaking like a sieve now. It was ok at the start. I gave it 2 stars, because it didn't leak right way, but I am disappointed because I have plenty of other Calphalon pieces of cookware and bakeware that I use more frequently and that I have not had to replace yet. The pan is otherwise in good shape--no scratches or other signs of wear and tear, and the clasp still seems nice and tight. It just leaks terribly."
2,Nonstick aspect is great but the pan leaks,"I have two of these pans. I have baked with them 4 times and each time one or both of them has leaked batter into my oven. Of course I am very careful to make sure that the bottom is seated right before pouring in batter. They don't leak so badly that anything is dripping when I put them in the oven, but when I look in the oven I can see a couple globs of batter on the bottom of the oven. The cakes turn out fine and in fact it is very easy to get them cleanly out of the pan, but it is not worth cleaning up the mess in my oven. I am getting rid of these and buying the non-springform pans."
2,Chauvet standard clamp,These clamps are what they are...cheap. Fine for small venue installs and for extremely light duty work. The design isn't the best... holding anything down with a wingnut is kind of silly. Par 38's or lighter only.
2,Not the best.... Not even that great...,"These clamps WILL hold your lights up to a T bar or truss, but then again, so will duct tape. These are hard to tighten, mark up your stands, and come off easily with just a little tug. Don't buy them, go for the ADJ O-clamps instead. Those things are great!!"
1,could not figure it out,"i could not figure out how to use this, so i just dont use it. if someone knows how to use it they might like it."
4,Great Warm Waether Item,I bought as a gift for my daughter-in-law for Christmas. I am sure she will like it! It was just what she wanted!
1,PH went up,"We refilled our tub yesterday and added alk up twice to get pH perfect at 7.6 then added the pH balance and it went up to 8.4! added pH down twice now, still working on it at 8.0. Our previous problem was persistent acidity so this is most unexpected. I waited about 40 minutes after the last alk up to recheck pH. If I was going to do it again maybe I would wait a day before adding the pH balance, though it doesn't say anything about needing to wait on the directions."
5,Excellent for the price,Exactly as described. Fits a 7-1/2 foot tree with room to spare. Seems pretty sturdy. Didn't tear as some do with the first use. Good buy for a regular sized tree. A larger tree would need 2 or more bags but for the price that would be ideal. Not as heavy to carry the whole tree.
1,it works...,but we found several very large plastic bins to work better for our needs. I would not purchase again.
1,Don't bother,"I was prepared to enjoy this book but found Mr. McCourt to be an insufferable blowhard. His constant name-dropping, arrogance and justifications as to the abandonment of his children at various stages in his life made me roll my eyes and wish I had saved my money. His writing has none of the charm of his brother Frank's, and his style of writing (the ""sez's"" and ""'twas's"") seemed contrived and made him seem like a caricature. All in all, a huge disappointment written by a man with a huge ego."
3,Small and plastic,"Read the description carefully - it looks like terra cotta, but it's actually plastic. It's also a bit smaller than I expected, about the size of a soccer ball. It looks nice on our patio and keeps a generally accurate temperature, but it's really not worth 32 dollars."
5,pretty good,"Good price. Lots of storage. Faster than my Sony a350 DSLR. You can pay more and get a faster card, but I don't mind if it takes a couple minutes longer while copying them to my pc."
3,"sandisk extreme 111 memory card, 8gb","this card is good but not as fast as the ""ESP"" technology cards from Sandish. I take pictures of wildlife and like the ""ESP"" technology better."
5,Extreme and AAAAA,Product was as advertised and was shipped faster than I had expected. This whole process could not have been better.
4,Great storage but...,"... I have lost data a couple of times, but i was able to eventually recover the data using the software provided by SanDisk. It was usually from having the memory card out and probably because i was walking around with it in my hand not in a storage container. But half of the photos would disappear according to my computer, but would be perfectly visible on my D300 camera. It was just unusual. But I still use this card, I am just very careful with it!"
1,LOST PHOTOS,"I used the flash drive in a rebel EOS. the flash card froze and could not be recongnized by the camera (or any other devices) after I took several hundred shots of my neice's wedding. I'm hoping a recovery firm can save it, but it all looks bad right now. this may be a fluke but several smaller cards would have been a better solution."
1,SanDisk gone Bad,"I bought this SanDisk 8GB back in March 2009 and it has gone bad with almost 200 pictures on it. Nothing like telling a family that I have lost every photo taken because of a bad SanDisk. I will never buy SanDisk again because I need to know that what I'm photographing is going to be there in the end. Very upset and just might have cost me a customer because my Canon 5d never gave a warning that the card was bad until I went to upload my pics.UPDATE: After long phone calls I finally sent the card back to SanDisk. So it has been a month and still no new card has been replaced. Another LONG phone call placed today and couldnt get a answer out of two people other than ""we will e-mail you within 24-48 hours"". I'm calling BS on SanDisk because if you say your going to back your product then you should replace ASAP. I'm shooting a wedding in two weeks and would like to have a new card. I did branch out and bought the Lexar Pro UDMA and there have not been any problems (knock on wood)."
2,Pretentious Porn,"I've seen better softcore and I've definitely seen more thought provoking films. This tries to be both and fails at them.I really tried looking for something of substance, but found none. It ends up just being a really boring skin flick."
1,Amazon messed up re. the cast.,"For some reason Amazon made a mistake in listing the cast for this movie. The cast listed is actually forClose to Home, NOT for ""Exterminating Angels"". Too bad, as I was looking forward to seeing Smadar Sayar."
4,Works as intended,"Works to connect a garden hose to me kitchen sink. Works fine but would be nice if there was another 2 or so threads for the hose side to give it a little more connection. The ""grip"" to remove is rough but I just use a wash cloth to remove from the sink when done."
1,Advertised incorrectly,"ADVERTISED as a 1"" thread and was not even close. Was a 3/4"" or mayabe a 5/8"" thread....Asked for a return and a refund, but as of October 30, 2011 I have not received my refund. My guess I will not get it, or it will be some kind of credit..."
5,Identify Yourself,"I've been looking for a book like this for a while. I highly recommend it to anyone that needs a little bird identification help and is confused on similar looking species. It offers many useful tips and a lot of great advice. This is not the book, however, if you're looking to identify flycatchers or specific shorebirds. Besides that, though, this is a fantastic book."
5,Does everything it says it can!,This is our second Raclette grill as our first did not have a temp control and we kind of liked that feature. This is just a fun way to cook lots of small items for taste variations.
2,"Cute, But Ripped Within First Week of Use","The title above says it all. For $15, I guess you can't expect the world, but still...David Greenbaum. Clearwater, FL."
1,It broke my i pod,ihad a brand new ipod only 5 months old. my mom bought me this i sound for christmas and after 2 weeks of having this product... it broke my i pod! thank god i have a warenty on my i pod.
5,The shadow,"The packaging on this book was exceptional, along with . The sender took great care with the book. It was in better shape than if I (could find) an purchase in any store. It was also sent in a padded envelope. Because of the quality of shipping, it makes me continue to enjoy ordering through amazon. Great experiences should be noted!"
4,First Literary Efforts of a Great Master,"Sketches by Boz is a delightful collection of vignettes and stories which Charles Dickens first published in various newspapers and magazines, and then published in book form in 1836. All the elements of later Dickens are already on display here, from deep pathos to occasionally overdone bathos, to scathingly sarcastic humor, to gentle and affectionate spoof. Some of the stories are really extremely funny, and wildly entertaining. Perhaps not a book to be read straight through, but savored in bits, like a good box of chocolates. The Penguin Classics edition has excellent notes and all the original George Cruikshank illustrations. For a writer's Opus 1, this is quite an accomplishment. I found it very enjoyable."
1,Display Excessively Bright,"Even at the lowest setting this unit will light up the room and make it difficult to sleep. Unless you want the equivalent of someone shinning a flashlight in your face all night, stay away from this unit."
1,absolute garbage,"I give this one star because it is nice that the phone works even when there is no power to the unit. The rest of this unit is garbage. The blue background is WAY to bright (like sleeping with the lights on) even on the dimmest setting. If you use th dim setting you can't see the numbers. You can change the contrast, but it doesn't work well. So if you can't SEE the time, and the LIGHT keeps you up all night, what good is it? After one night, my husband said, ""return that piece of -----.""."
4,GE Phone Clock Radio,"This was purchased to replace an earlier model of GE Phone Clock Radio that just rolled over and gave up...this also has the dual alarm feature wich I like...the snooze is 10 minutes instead of 7...just required an adjustment on my part...what, you don't use the snooze?...then you lose...the handset is smaller and the cord is to short for me, but....I like the disply better and have learned to navigate the setup procedures...also it has a smaller fotprint than the old one, another plus...I'd say for the reasonable price a pretty decent unit"
4,"Amazon.com ""policy""","I ordered this item in mid June. The Amazon.com ad did not indicate ""unavailability"" for the item.On 6/27/07, when I checked my ""order status"" Amazon.com indicated an estimated ship date of 8/26 - 8/29.If the item wasn't readily available, Amazon.com should inform the customer Prior to order placement."
2,GE Clock radio,"The display area for time, etc is too big and too bright a light. The light can be adjusted some, but even on the lowest light setting, it's still too bright in the bedroom for me to sleep. The digital time display is a darker blue and the surrounding area is light blue. It lights up the whole room like a very bright night light."
2,A very bad place to start with LPD.,"This album is a collection of the Legendary Pink Dots' older, unreleased, and rare cuts. All of them very raw and dated, and can't compare with their newer... dare I say... accessible, work.If you're a Pink Dots aficianado like I am, then naturally you must pick up this album simply because it represents an evolutionary step in the Dots' varied musical history. If you're just starting out however, I would guide you to ""The Maria Dimension,"" ""Nine Lives to Wonder,"" ""Crushed Velvet Apocalypse,"" or ""Chemical Playschool Vol. 8 & 9."""
5,great book,I bought my 17 year old son this book for a stocking stuffer and I think it was one of his favorite gifts. A great book for college!
4,Gift for friend,"I got this as a gift for my friend and she says she loves it! Sounds tasty, not sure how much she uses it thought :)"
3,One of the original hippies,"Eden Ahbez was one of the original hippies before the term was used. Eden was most certainly before his time, living a true bohemian lifestyle(sporting long hair and a beard, he must of seemed really weird to the folks back then) influenced by the california ""nature boys"" who lived outside under the stars, ate fruits and nuts and practiced meditation and yoga. These ""nature boys"" was a heavy influence on the later known hippies of 1960's and the music here relects their philosophy. Eden wrote all the tunes, plays a few of the instruments along with singing occassionally and reciting his beat style poetry. The music is exotica (a weird mix of tropical sounds, 50's pop and jazz)which can be considered kind of like the ""new age"" music of its day, very relaxing. If for nothing else, this is a great historical document in song and sound of the precurser to the late 60's counter culture."
2,great book if you already know the material,"Andy Rex, one of the text's authors, was in my Physics Department when I attended the University of Puget Sound, so I naturally used this textbook when I took Modern Physics (taught by another professor). The book is not good for students who are in the process of learning the material it presents for the first time. It is history- and derivation-heavy, but nearly devoid of analysis and ignores ""the big picture."" It was a wonderful reference when I was doing graduate work -- I already had a very solid background in Calculus, dimensional analysis, Quantum Mechanics, and so forth -- but it is not a good textbook if you are learning the material for the first time."
3,not bad,"I almost never feel I fully understand the chapters, but then again it's Quantum Mechanics which I hear is quite difficult to really understand.That said, the book tries to ease the student in with broad introductions that tie in with chapters previous and to come... then it proves with the math and some figures."
5,Great Goonitude,"I wasn't expecting a lot when I ordered this book but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. The story is very interesting and the author doesn't miss any details. It's a must have for any ""old time"" hockey fan's library."
4,Hoover S3639,"nice vac, my wife prefers canister vacs to uprights. Seems to do good job and the smaller power head is great for the stairs."
4,S3639 Windtunnel,"Easy to use. Good suction, performance on par with my old Panasonic canister.On and off petal should be a different color than the cord rewind petal."
2,doesn't hold up,"I bought this model a couple of years ago. It is cheaply made and has not held up well. The brush deteriorated within 6 months. The retractable cord rarely does. The bag full indicator hasn't worked since almost the beginning. The plastic hinges have all broken and I now have no suction. It doesn't roll smoothly and bangs into all of the furniture. My last, much older Hoover canister, was so much better (and better built) that this model has been a major disappointment. Save your money and put it toward something better."
1,lots of problems - then it just quit,"I have had lots of problems with this vacuum. Plastic parts have broken, the cover never stayed on, the hose keeps coming out of the canister, the cord doesn't recoil...Then it started overheating and now has quit completely on me.When it worked it was great, but very quickly it started breaking."
2,Does the plot ever change?,"Allow me to begin with the fact that I have always enjoyed Smith's writing and I love the Night World series, but this latest one is too much. Each book has the same glossed-over plot. They supposedly cruel vampires miraculouly meet their soulmate and...big shock...it is a human. I wish that there could be more substance in the next dozen books."
3,an ok book,I thought that this was one of the weaker Night World books but still wrorth the read. I didn't like the characters all that much. This and Dark Angel go at the bottom of my list.
4,Black Dawn is intriging.,"Black Dawn, like most of Lisa Jane Smith's books, is enjoyable. To get the full affect of Black Dawn you must read the other books in this fascinating series. The Night World books are excellent and I can't wait for the newest one to come out in Spring.Now back to the book. The characters are good, although a slight bit undeveloped. There are a few return characters. Like Hunter Redfurn. And like almost all of Lisa Jane Smith books I have read involves Soul Mates, desperate love, and danger. I would reccomend this, and any other Night world books to Fantasy and Science Fiction lovers."
4,What is going to piss me off...,"Once every season has been individually released, you just KNOW they are going to re-issue the complete series in a deluxe and very cool package, probably inside a crypt-like box replete with a miniature Cryptkeeper figure. I just know it's coming, and I HATE IT."
1,Blank CD,"I bought this in 2009 and when I tried to listen to it, it was totally silent. Several other CDs I bought at the same time were fine, so the problem wasn't me, or my equipment. Apparently no one else had this problem--or they are slower to complain than I am (very, very slow, this time)."
3,Time without consequence,I bought this CD because I wanted to have one particular song. The rest of his music is very similar and not what I usually listen to.
5,"""A word is not the same with one writer as with another...","...One tears it from his guts. The other pulls it out of his overcoat pocket."" (Charles Peguy, p 479) What a wonderful reference! I have found this book useful for speeches, papers, special occasions, toasts, etc. Organized topically, this book is amazingly easy to use and is filled with great quotes from a wide variety of sources (the Bible, various ethnic proverbs, presidents and other political figures, a range of artists and writers and various entertainers). A great book for anyone who ever speaks or writes in any capacity."
3,AS A HISTORICAL CURIOSITY ONLY!,"THE RECORDING DOES NOT DESERVE 3 STARS, BUT . . . I COULD NOT BE CRUEL. LET'S SAY IT'S A TRIAL RUN FOR ELIXIR D'AMORE. THE SOUND IS ATROCIOUS--BUT THAT IS A BYPRODUCT OF ITS BEING RECORDED LIVE. I HATE SOUBRETTE VOICES LIKE TUCCI'S--BUT THAT IS A PERSONAL HANG-UP. AND YET, IT IS THE ONLY RECORDING I COULD FIND. SO I GOT IT. BETTER TO HAVE HEARD IT THAN NOT."
4,Lemon n' Creamy,Sesderma C-Vit Moisturizing Face Cream....I really liked this product. The lemon ingredient was refreshing and clean smelling. The cream absorbed easily and I would purchase this product again....and the C added was a plus as this has been recently touted as a beneficial additive as well....:)
3,difficult,"This book pretty much tells you what you need to know for the FTCE. It gives a basic explanation and then examples. I also like the sample exams that are included. The book is very good for people that are already familiar with these types of math problems because it does not give a thorough explanation. It skips steps in a problem because it assumes that the person using the book already has the basic understanding of the problem. I have been using this book along with other resources found on the internet that breaks down the problem. Since I've been out of school for years, I needed a resource that could do that.I knew this about the book because of other reviews I read but purchased it because I couldn't find anything better."
5,"If You're Just A Clown, Don't Write A Review...","I don't know what this guy who wrote the review before me is on, but he's obviously an ignorant hater. This guy probably never even watched this DVD, but since he can't spell or make sense any better than that, what more could you expect? Basically, there is a reason that S.M.A.C.K. is the #1 hip hop DVD magazine in the streets: because it is raw, and always top-quality. As usual for S.M.A.C.K., in Volume 8 you can expect a solid DVD loaded with exclusive interviews, freestyles, uncut music videos and more. And forget these 30 or 40 minute long DVD's all over the place these days, this DVD is over 90 minutes long with nothing but the realest street sh--, no filler. Again, if you're just a clown, don't write a review, but if you know what the hell you're talkin' about then go for it."
4,Six Organs Of Admittance - 'Sun Awakes' (Drag City),"Before a friend talked me into borrowing this CD,I've never even heard of this part space rock,part experimental artist.Turns out it's actually a solo work by Comets Of Fire member guitarist/vocalist Ben Chasney.It's good,if you like this sort of music.Better tracks were ""Torn By Wolves"",the rhythmic ""Black Wall"" and the 23-minute ""River Of Transfiguration""(perhaps the CD's best cut).Certain listeners MAY get even MORE out of this CD than I did.May appeal to fans of John Fahey,Sun City Girls,Davis Redford Triad and possibly Red Krayola."
3,The forest will echo with laughter,"This music conjures images of misty mountains, smoke rings, and sojourning hobbits. Non-hippie listeners: approach with caution."
5,A Collection of Thoughts,"A page-turner! A great blend of fiction of non-fiction. I could not put the book down once I started reading it. Two stories, Victim & Blood Brothers, are destined to be American favorites. This is a book I did not want to end. For a new author, I love the way Wooden put his thoughts together. This is a must read!"
5,LOVE CAN BUILD A BRIDGE!,"""Where you come from is as important as where you're going,"" so says and sings Naomi Judd through the eyes of a child in this charming story inspired by reflections on her great-grandparents. The book is written for children ages 4-8. The song on the companion CD is for anyone. Included in the book are beautiful paintings by Dan Andreasen which capture and enhance the quality of this gift of family love, and those special places and memories stored in the heart. It is an enchanting book, and yes, love can build a bridge across time."
4,Bought it for parents for christmas,They enjoyed it! Brings back fond memories of Sunday evenings in front of the t.v. watching all the talented singers and comedians
2,Disappointed - Too Short,"I am a huge fan of Christmas shows, new and old. I bought this expecting some great ""vintage"" performances. There were a few good ones, but many were actually cut off. A few were also just shown in a quick snippet. I was seriously shocked when the end came. I felt a bit cheated. There had to have been tons of performances that could've been included. Just disappointed."
3,"OK, Not Great","Best features: Quality of the clips is mostly good to excellent; same with the audio. It was good to see Bing Crosby singing portions of White Christmas. No lingering watermarks in the corner of the screen. Unexpected, delightful surprise: The Cowsills...this family could SING. Fun clip: Alvin and the Chipmonks.Worst features: It's not an hour long, it's only 46 minutes. The scene menu is hard to figure out. Too many of the clips are just segments, not the entire act. Comedy acts?...boring and outdated. Joan Rivers singing. Rich Little doing imitations of people long dead (was it really necessary to include an impersonator??).Bottom line: It's inexpensive, but on the boring side. It will definitely not be on my annual viewing list."
5,Marvelous Fun,"It amazes me that the Ditty Bops can sing about the most mundane things and make it interesting and fun to listen to. If you liked the first album, you'll love this one. There is no way to categorize the music. You have to hear it for yourself and once you have, you are hooked. The ladies voices are just beautiful too and blend together perfectly. This is an album not be be missed. It's not like anything else out there and that doesn't mean it is a novelty ablum. It's good music that is a joy to listen to. I think the Ditty Bops will be around for a while if they continue to delight as much as they have on the first two albums."
3,A mix of gems and rocks,"After a very impressive debut 2 years ago, I was thinking the Bops would come out with an even stronger release. On this CD, Abby and Amanda still have the charm that got me hooked on their style and innovative lyrics, but some of their songs just don't seem to get anywhere musically. Still, ""Bye Bye Love"" is so catchy that it stays with you all day. ""Waking up in the City"" is very clever too and so is ""Your Head's Too Big."" For a fan, this one culd have been better but is still worthwhile."
1,blach,this item is small and not durable at all .... with on touch it all goes down ... very bad item
3,"""Hitter"" doesn't delve enough into HITTING","""Hitter"" is one of those books that tells you too much about Ted Williams' life as a child. I've had it up to ""here"" with all of this psychobabble (dysfunctional, abuse, blah-blah-blah) passing as journalism these days.I bought the book because I thought I'd get some technical analysis about hitting a baseball from the best hitter who ever played the game. But the book spends too much time telling us about what a goofy mother Ted had and what a bum his father was. Big deal. I want to know what Ted was THINKING when he was standing at the plate and how he analyzed the pitch (in four-tenths of a second), not the touchy-feely FEELING garbage that permeates the book.If anyone knows of a good Ted Williams book that deals with the ""How to Hit"" aspect of baseball, please drop me an e-mail note.Thanks,-Don Farrar"
3,These hold alot!,Glossy white is`nt a color you want to have when your trying to hide!But easy to fix get some flat black or flat camo spray paints.
1,EXPENSIVE!,I was going to purchase this recipe book until I saw the price.....WHY is this so expensive? Am I reading the price correctly??
4,A child with Cerebal Palsy...,"Jean Little does an excellent job in explaining the life of a little girl by the name of Sal to the rest of the public. This girl is very courageous and goes through some very big hurdles and obstacles, but she is eventually going to get through some of the hurdles, but it will take some time. I think that she does an excellent job with this. If you want to find out more about Jean Little and Sal, read Mine for Keeps."
4,Terrific illustrations and explanations,"This is a great starter cookbook. I bought it because it was illustrated, and the full color pictures have come in handy many a time. When I'm reading a recipe (from this book or not), if it references a type of knife or pan or utensil I'm not familiar with, I grab this book and look it up in the pictures in the front. The pictures explaining all the different utensils, spices, techniques are absolutely indispensable.This has a wide variety of recipes, and with the large color photo section, you can browse on looks and then refer to the step by step instructions. Some of the recipes might be better left in the 1970's (cold salmon mousse molded in the shape of a fish, complete with peppercorns for eyes??), but even those just gave me a good laugh."
1,Missing most common recipes,"Very disappointing! I thought this older version would have some of the ""tried and true"" recipes -- how about corned beef hashor basic-from-scratch chocolate pudding? The many pictures are no substitute for recipes that help a novice get through all the mysteries in the kitchen. My old fat Good Housekeeping cookbook (lost in a fire) presented a large variety of useful recipes clearly; this book is just fluff."
1,No Rain Guage At All,Mine didnt even come with the rain guage. It didnt come with the cork pads. Thank goodness for the other reviews that amazon has supplied. They will at least give me the chance to locate a replacement.
5,Great product,"Great product. I am a beginner at burning video so it is perfect for me. There are a few more things I wish it would do but for the price it is an outstanding product. I have had no problems capturing, editing and rendering video from my DV camcorder. I have tried Pennacle(junk) and Roxio and was not happy with either. Adobe has come out with a great product that won't break the bank and gives you a lot of things you can do with your video."
2,Couldn't install on my computer,"I'd used Premiere when it first came out, and I was excited that there was an affordable version with great reviews. I checked that I had enough RAM and hard disk space and I ordered.I was horribly disappointed that it requires Intel Pentium 4, M, D, or Extreme Edition or AMD Opteron or Athlon 64 (SSE2 support required) and though my system is less than 2 years old, I don't have the qualifying chip!A true disappointment!Otherwise, it's probably great software"
4,Culinary School on just 3 DVD's!,"I bought this DVD with the intention of learning how to cook different types of foods. This comes on 3 DVD's and covers a wide range of cooking skills ranging from knife skills and vegetable preparation, to specific cooking techniques.This is really educational and can be a drop boring at some points if you are looking for the Razzle-Dazzle that comes with a Food Network show. The chefs don't have that 'dynamic' power to draw in an audience. But they are smart and are patient to show the audience every step in cooking.Definitely a MUST if you want to increase your knowledge about preparing different foods."
4,Not so 'great',"For his third entry in his 'retro' series Barry does justice to the songs he's chosen for this CD. I just wish he would've chosen some different songs though. Too many ""downer"" songs. The 50's and 60's CDs were more enjoyable."
3,Not the best collection,Some of the songs chosen have been heard quite a few times before.Would have appreciatred a better selection from the Seventies!
1,Yawn.,"Same old story: Quack scientist comes up with hair-brained theory which overturns all conventional thinking. His colleagues do their best not to laugh, eventually grow tired of his rantings, and then they drop him. Quack scientist then goes on to publish his to-date supressed findings. I tried to finish the book, but kept returning to the same old adage: Old wine, old bottle."
3,A mix of curious & bitter,"Halton Arp is a great deep sky observer, & his observations are leading him into some really interesting directions. If these aren't coincidences, then we're looking at a new map of the cosmos beyond the Milky Way. However, the book is also interlarded with the story of how he, his observations, & similar observations of others have been disdainfully treated by other astronomers."
5,My husband loved these!,"He had mentioned eating these growing up, but we hadn't seen them in store anywhere. I finally found them here, ordered him a box for Christmas. I ended up giving them to him sooner because I was so excited to see what he thought. He loved them and said they were like he remembered. We'll order again. I thought they were pretty good, too."
5,Examples Galore,"This book is in the style of most Go books in its use of examples an nearly every page. For the beginner this can be difficult to cope with but it is important nonetheless. While it suffers from being only one book, it is a wonderful way to start the path of a beginner because it feels like you're playing with someone instead of just trying to read and remember."
4,Very good but a little dated,"This is the book I learned from almost 20 years ago, mainly because it was one of the very few books available in English back then. For a compact, inexpensive one-volume introduction to the game it's hard to beat. It covers in abbreviated form all the major aspects of play: openings, life-and-death, territory vs. influence, endgame. It's a very dense read, though, and makes heavy use of the Japanese Go terms. Especially for younger readers, I prefer the Janice Kim ""Learn to Play Go"" series, with it's more open style and greater volume of explanatory material in modern language. However, that will set you back about $80-90 for the 5-volume set."
2,Go for Beginners Book Fell Apart,Book was used and showed signs of discoloring. After a couple of uses of book for reference- pages began to fall out.
5,A Mature Introduction,"At present, there are numerous introductory go books available in the english language. Older titles occasionally go out of print, so it is sometimes necessary to create new ones to accomodate the next generation of players. Fortunately, Iwamoto's classic book has been continually available since its publication in the early 1970's. It follows an older style of writing and presentation characterized by concise exposition and the abundant use of Japanese terminology. The author seems to be writing primarily for a mature audience with a sincere interest in learning the basic rules of the game. Therefore, it may be unsuited to younger readers accustomed to the more contemporary manuals written in a casual and conversational style. 'Go For Beginners' was one of the first books about Go written in the english language and it still remains one of the finest. I give it the highest recommendation."
4,Piñon wood,I would rename this cologne Gucci Santa Fé because its scent smells strongly of the piñon logs that are burned there in the wintertime. I really enjoy wearing this as a weekend fragrance.
1,"Poorly packed, never used","Bought this as a gift for my mom, but it was packed in a box that it had no business being in. We received it and it was bent nearly in half. So we tossed it out without even taking it out of the plastic and went to a local store and bought one instead.One of the worst purchases I've ever made."
5,An interesting morsel,"This is not really a review, but an observation. For fans of the Alex Proyas movie ""Dark City,"" the character of Dr. D.P. Schreber is based at least partially on the eponymous author of this book. It was ""Dark City"" which lead me, by a circuitous route, to this book--which I will be ordering presently."
5,So much fun on one disc!,Listening to this CD instantly puts anyone in a good mood- including me and my toddler. She loves to dance to all of these songs- I don't get tired of singing along either!!
5,Watch your little ones go.......,"The music is really the same as you hear on all the DVD's. Great job once again to all those involved in the production of Hi-5. I LOVE your music and your DVD's My 20 month old daughter wakes up each morning and says, ""Hi-5???"" I hope you will do a live show in Montreal Quebec!Kim"
4,10 songs only (not considering songlets),Book with lyrics inside the CD case is very good to entertain children(nice pictures and colors). The CD could have more songs though.
2,Strap too flimsy,"You buy an organizer handbag to be a workhorse. Let's face it, these things are not where we rack up the fashion points. Since it's clearly going to be a workhorse handbag, I cannot fathom why the company only used a few flimsy stitches of thread to attach the strap to the bag. My shoulder strap became loose and ultimately detached completely after only about 4 or 5 months of regular use. If I had paid $29 for it, maybe, but at $100+ it's really unacceptable. The organizer part of the bag is great, but it's not doing me any good sitting in the drawer until I can get it to a leather repair shop..."
2,Hard to clean,"I wanted a safer strainer since my last one was plastic. I love stainless steel kitchen items but unfortunately, this one isn't so great. It functions great as a strainer but it's really hard to clean. Food items (especially pasta) gets stuck in all the little holes and takes a lot longer to clean. I never really feel like it's fully clean. I'll probably be buying a different strainer sometime soon."
3,Two different perspectives.,"There are two ways to see this film. One, as a Julie Garwood fan, and two, as a made for T.V movie lover. As a Garwood fan, the movie is a disappointment in the sense that the characters and the situation were changed too much. As a movie on it's own, it's a very nice film to watch. My friend had never heard of the book and she absolutuely loved the movie. Keeping both perspectives in mind, it gets 3 stars."
3,Decent,"I thought the movie was alright. As a true Julie Garwoodfan I got into the movie because I knew the characters. I think the storline involving Cole was extremely sad, and so off of what the book did. I think if they would have waited till the book was finished, they would have done better. The cast was terrific though. I thought all the characters brought out what Julie Garwood wroe them as. Ccle's character was extremely great. Justin Chambers is an exceptional actor, and good looking too."
1,Cole Clayborne can't possibly be dead!,"I just got finished reading Come the Spring with Cole Clayborne as the main character. This book is the third book in a trilogy that started with For the Roses. I was going to buy the movie ""Rose Hill"" but after finding out that Cole is killed off in the movie, there's no way I can even fathom seeing the movie, let alone spending money on it, now. Julie Garwood's book are sexy, romantic, full of hope and Cole Clayborne was my favorite character. I looked at all the actors chosen to portray the Clayborne brothers and none of them were who I had pictured as the rough, good-looking, sexy men of Rosehill/Blue Belle, Montana. Hallmark did a great disservice to the author and to the fans of For the Roses/The Clayborne Brides and Come the Spring. Especially Come the Spring."
1,waste of money,"Had NOTHING to do with the books, which were VERY good.Even the characters' names were not quite right.The basic background story is important to understandwhy the characters do what they've chosen to do.And, Cole Claybourne was NOT supposed to die.Ridiculous adaptation (complete re-write) of what had beena great book series. sigh, don't wast your sheckles."
3,Good 'old-style' space romp,"A classic from the old 'boys school of space opera' (like Heinlein's juveniles). All 3 are very short novels, they are a very quick read, with lots of action and improbable last-minute escapes. The settings are the most interesting parts of the drama, and how these settings affect the characters that live on these death-dealing planets. The protagonist is a pretty typical super-skilled quick-witted know-it-all, but is fairly likeable -- the con artist with the heart of gold."
2,Boring with little depth,"The first book starts off well, but goes downhill thereafter. There is very little character development and one develops no empathy for the hero."
2,Eh....,"Three episodes in one book. Starts out exciting, great descriptions of the dangers of this alien landscape, interesting characters -- BUT.... everything fizzles out by the middle of the first episode."
5,Simply beautiful,"I have just finished reading this book, and probably should not be attempting to write a review because words fail to describe how wonderful this book is. It is the most beautiful book I have ever read. It is written in Hesse's gentle, quiet style, and consists of metaphorical meditations on wandering. The imagery is graceful while the implications resound deep within one. Each sketch moved me deeply. This is Hesse at his best, a spiritual explorer, free of dogma, immersing himself and the reader in simple yet fascinating reflections. I plan on reading this book frequently, savoring each image and feeling the serenity created by Hesse's prose. I would urge everyone to read this book."
1,Drowned in Detail without Insight,"Despite all the hoopla, this is a bad, bad book, which reads as if two dozen researchers had gathered every scrap of information on the first part of this century and then the most unimaginative of writers had just put them in chronological order and called it a history."
3,Good except for noticeable distortion with line level outputs,"I bought this to use with an iPod sitting in an Apple dock. Unfortunately there was very noticeable distortion when hooked up to the line level output of the dock. Although this is documented in the operating instructions, I thought I would pass it on here so others can be informed before purchasing. From the manual:""Be sure to connect this unit to the headphone jack of the stereo audio source device to be connected. If this unit is connected to the LINE OUT jack of the device to be connected, the sound may be distorted.""I can vouch that this does cause distortion in the case of the Apple iPod dock. The sound quality is actually quite good when plugged into the headphone jack (you may need to lower the volume of the iPod). Whether this is good choice for you really depends on how you intend to use it ."
1,Not ready for primetime,"I bought this adapter so I could listen to my TV with bluetooth headphones. I returned the adapter for two reasons: 1) The place in the back of the transmitter where the line out jack is plugged in was flimsy; I had to push the jack in really hard to form a connection. 2) There was a sound lag that made watching TV while listening not enjoyable.This adapter is definitely ""not ready for primetime""."
1,does not work,"I got this product in conjuction with the ipod bluetooth adapter.I have the ipod in a closet with my home stereo.You can travel about 18 feet, with the clost door open, to my sliding door to the deck before it drops the signal with the door closed about 5 feet.In short does not work. I would not recommend this prduct to anyone. Amazon refunded my money no problem. I invested an addtional 60 dollars over what i paid for the two poducts and got a keyspan tuneview. WOW this product works through doors and every obstruction just like you were holding the ipod in your hand."
1,Very poor device,The sound quality is poor and the unit is really not a quality product. I'm surprised it has the Sony name on it.
4,Works as advertised,"Works as advertised - good for connecting an iPhone or the like on an ad hoc basis to a stereo system. Keep in mind that it only supports the A2DP audio profile and not the AVRCP control profile, so you'll need to play/pause etc from the component generating the sound. Sound is typical Bluetooth quality - not as good as a wire, but decent. I had no trouble with reception range - it would connect with my iPhone from the next room."
3,Too noisy for digital audio!,"I use this device to send audio from laptops and ipod. It's easy to set up and connected to my stereo system, but when there is a bluetooth connection (even when there is no audio signal is transmitted, like when paused), there is a significant level of hiss noise coming out of the analog out of this device. I use a sony bluetooth headphone DR-BT50, which has excellent sound quality and very low noise level, but this device is not at that level. For comparison, if I connect iPod headphone out directly to the stereo, the noise level is below ambient room noise.In short, if you want to enjoy Chopin, this is probably not for you. For party? Yes, this would work."
2,DISAPPOINTED!,"This movie was beyond a fairy tale. It jump back and forth to so many issues. While it does has some warmth to it, there were too many parameters involved. I suggest borrowing it from the library or watching it the Hallmark channel."
2,Wouldn't spend money for this!,"Sorry, but couldn't connect with the male lead, he was jerky. And the time they spent watching the little girl bordered on stalking. I know they were trying to create a connection, but found this extremely creepy. Just my humble opinion."
3,"Small, simple, affordable","This is my first Bluetooth transmitter, so comparisons are hard, but this does the job well at an affordable price. I accidentally dropped it several feet to the floor and it withstood the jar, so it must be rugged. I did find the on/off button a bit hard to find and press -- especially in the dark. But overall, I'm happy with my purchase."
4,Better than Jabra Bluetooth Music Adaptor,"I wanted this device to connect Bluetooth headphones to my Home Theater System.I already owned the Jabra Bluetooth Music Adaptor (A120s), which worked great with theMotorola MOTOROKR S9 Bluetooth Stereo Headphones, however it did not work with theMotorola S805 Bluetooth D.J. Style Stereo Headsetheadphones which I recently purchased. So I then purchased this Sony Bluetooth Transmitter Adaptor (TMR-BT10A) in hopes that it would work with the S805, and to my relief it did.I like the charging cradle, which the Jabra A120s does not have, and the AC plug-in charger, instead of the USB only one that the Jabra uses.The only negative I've found is that if you walk too far away, and the signal is dropped significantly, then you have to re-sync the device, where the Jabra would just pick up the signal again on it's own. Still, the Sony works great and was definitely worth the price."
3,Crabtree & Evelyn 2792 Gardeners Hand Therapy,This really didn't do anything for my dry hands after a couple of uses. I probably wouldn't buy i again.
5,Conman puts nave girl in danger,"A good-looking conman's one night stand with a girl he meets on a Norwegian holiday puts her in peril when she tracks him down at his job as a caravan seller in East Anglia, and tells him she's pregnant.He's a lot to lose - he's engaged to a rather plain but well off fiance.The police have to find her before her ruthless seducer James Hunt can eliminate her.Excellent fen scenes.This is Garve at the top of his form."
1,Less debate if God or Jesus wrote the bible himself,"Admittedly Most of Chrisianity like many religions weren't written by ""God"" or ""Jesus"" himself. Instead our whole belief system sits on the worlds of ""Inspired"" men. Micheal Korish was inspired in Waco, Texas! . Bottomline, it leaves the door open to translation, corruption and influence. So, whats wrong with asking questions and seeking whats right about our religion. But what really burns me was Reviewer Violet who finsihes with ""If anyone comes to you bearing this book, beware: they're probably less interested in being holy than in being right."" I would rather be Right and an outcast than Holy and Wrong! Sounds like she had a logic( ). I agree with the books purpose but thougt it could have been written a lot better."
4,Doulbe-Barrelled Modern Piano,"Here's a great program of varied and mostly interesting contemporary music for two pianos.Standouts: The David Borden piece, a romanto-minimalist workout of counterpoint that gradually builds to an exciting conclusion. The Paul Bowles is a quirky, somewhat exotic outing. The Morton Feldman, well, sounds like Morton Feldman. And the ""Blue"" Gene Tyranny is a lovely, rambling journey.Near-Misses: Ellington's ""Tonk"" is a rather square performance, you'll want to listen to one of Duke & Strayhorns rockin' duet performances of this interesting miniature instead. And the Meredith Monk stuff is on the dull side.Still, if you want an inspired tour of hard-to-find quality modern music performed by an incredible piano duo, you'll want to add this to your collection right away."
5,Perfect for those migrating from windows,I have been slowly migrating to Linux from the windows world and this is by far the easiest of the Linux installs(if you have fairly basic hardware) . It comes with just about everything you would want out of teh box and adding new programs is faily easy. I would recommend this to newbies. You can always get a more complex linux flavor in the future if you become a Linux expert.
2,Overtly religious,"I am definitely interested in the topic of this book, but find myself having to skim through pages and pages of it because it is so overtly, and in my opinion overly, religious. As in: in your face. I would define myself as a spiritual person, and I do not have a problem with the concept of God, but I really feel like I am in a bible study class having to pick out tiny pieces of what I really came for. I get that the author felt the need to ""testify"" here, but I wish that it had been more accurately labled - maybe ""A Christian Path of Recovery for Adult Children..."" or something like that. In a sense, as a shamed person, the pounding perspective of this book makes me feel like an outsider for not coming from that place. It probably wasn't the author's intention to make anyone feel alienated, but there it is."
2,Don't waste your money,"This book is by far the worst I've ever seen in terms of editing. The book is filled with paragraph duplications and missing information. With errors like these, how can they expect you to trust their advice on how to achieve a good score?!The sample questions are confusing, and the answer explainations left me scratching my head even more. They're vague at best, and sometimes down-right WRONG!This book is a real confidence buster. It really freaked me out to see how poorly I did on the sample tests. I know I'm not half the idiot they made me out to be!What a waste of time and money! I don't recommend this book to anyone. The Princeton Review book and the Official GMAT study book are by far superior to this one."
2,Poor Editing,"I just received this book yesterday, so I don't have a lot to say about the test-taking advice and practice questions. All I have read so far is the first chapter (introduction). In all honesty, I find it hard to believe this book was even edited. On at least four occasions, I found myself feeling deja vue - and the reason was entire sections were duplicated and repeated in succession! And it's not like they accidentally put in the same page twice. You finish a section at the bottom of one page, and there it is again at the top of the next page. I just don't understand how that could happen - if anyone took the time to give the chapter a once-over they would have caught it. Interestingly, you can see the introduction right here on Amazon before purchasing, but the problem appears to have been fixed for the online view. Too bad not for the $26 version I bought."
4,"Difficult tests, but good problems","I bought this book about a week before taking the GMATs so that I could do some more practice tests. Although I didn't score well on the practice tests, my real GMAT score was great. So I suggest that you don't get discouraged if your Kaplan practice test scores aren't as high as you'd like. Just add 100 points to your practice test score to see what you'd get on the real GMAT. Other than that, the problems are well written with many good subtleties."
3,Use this book - Carefully,"The material is not too bad. It provides you a different angle to look at this test. Raises some points and gives some helpful tips that the official guide cannot or will not divulge.However I have serious problems with the practice questions. A lot of times they do not seem to be testing the kind of skills that actual GMAT will test. Sometimes Kaplan plays 'cheap tricks' in an attempt to make the questions (unnecessarily) difficult.For my prep, I read the informational material from both Kaplan and GMAC's Official Guide. For practice I relied entirely on official guide, PowerPrep, and retired GMAT exams availible from GMAC. That got me a score of 750."
1,two karchers failed after light use!,"I bought Karcher K 3.47 and used it for about 8 times just little bit over one year, then a leaking problem made it total useless. I was in the middle of cleaning my patio for the coming party. Without thinking too much, I rushed to store and bought another karcher (K3.67) just in order to finish the work. This time after barely 4 use, the pump outlet now has low pressure. I never wrote any product review before, but after reading similar experience from other users, I decide to warn other customers too! This is just a poor product. Don't be fool by its nice look!"
3,Karsher Pressure Washer,"Pretty good pressure and very handy for cleaning house and cars. Lack of cable holder makes it difficult to carry around a house. Also, it may be difficult to plug in covered outside outlets due to shape of electric plug.Karcher 1,750 PSI 120-Volt Electric Pressure Washer #K 3.67 M"
1,Keep Looking,"Pretty and compact. Great. We have a very pretty and compact paperweight in the bedroom, now. After less than a year, must open and close the disc player several times to get it to recognize a dvd, if it will at all. The always-on blue light is so bright that we drape fabric or paper over it to be able to sleep. The sub-woofer is useless. Hook your iPod up and you can listen to your (muffled) music library, but you would be served better by a much smaller iPod dock for that. Just keep looking... We are... again."
2,Dissapointed,"Received this toy yesterday afternoon. Looks good, finally I found a toy that my 1 yr. old Cocker Spaniel will not destroy. Boy was I mistaken!! He had that chewed up before I even got sat down. I can't seem to find any toys that he won't destroy. I was very disappointed in this toy.Give it to a dog that doesn't like to chew!! Although, I will say that it is made very well, just not for Dakota!"
2,Kong Jack,"Kong are suppose to be sturdy toys, my Pitbull had it broken in less than an hour. Maybe smaller dogs will do ok with it."
4,At last,My Samoyed loves this toy and so far hasn't managed to trash it. Although he did manage to pull the sqeaker out! It's pretty sturdy and VERY chewable.
2,Organized traditionals?,This CD of African music sounds a bit too organized and clean to be authentic. The charm and much of the soul of the tribal impression seems digitalized out to make a selling album out of it.Pity.I did however have part of the opening track Kulumbu as my ansaphone message a while ago. So the album is not useless. It's just too polished and undusty.
5,My favorites songs,"It is a great album overall but for me it is simple, in this album there are two songs that are just incredible: Dias y Flores and Playa Giron. They are two of my favorites songs ever (having in mind The Beatles, Pink Floyd, etc.)"
3,"a nice book, but a poor ending to a series","so who is the witch, not a witch, who woke up the dragon? who is the fourth wild power? will the shapeshifters who sceceded with the dragon be wooed back by the first house now that keller and galan's have united with the witch child? what are the consequences of that ANIMAL PANIC for the relationship of the nightworld and the humanworld, which was on the cusp of discovering it at the end of this book? does anyone care anymore? one of the things i liked about the night world series when i was reading it years ago was LJS's attempt to tap into to pre-millenial-anxiety. but of course the millenium has well and truly passed now, both versions, 2000 and 2001. can strange fate even be released now? i really hope that it is because while witchlight is a fine book it's a terribly inconclusive end to a series that a lot of people care about."
2,It was ok,Witchlight was a very good book however it was not the best book out the series .One Keller was to rarse on Illand . the ending was the best part of the book
4,Old memories can overrule logic...,"A smart small town lawyer (ex-lawman) is hooked into a complex case that involves his first time lover. He isn't over her yet and it messes with his logic.Characters from all levels of life interweave to form a story where the being rich has perks but doesn't mean happiness.My first J.Burke book, I'm already looking forward to the next installment."
1,"strong start, rambling conclusion","A promising start, typical of a Burke novel, but a very rare rambling conclusion, that left me anxious to finish while hoping for a more Burkelike conclusion."
3,Beautiful writing but same (old) story,"I hate to say anything negative about James Lee BUrke because he is one of my favorite writers, but it's past time for something different. Billy Bob Holland and Dave Robicheaux are pretty much the same character, and the last few books have had the same elements over and over again. On the positive side, Mr. Burke's writing is as stunningly beautiful as ever."
3,Healing Foods,I thought this book was going to be a lot bigger than it acutally is. I would recommend finding the larger size. This one is hard to read. But it arrived quicly and in new condition.
5,This book is the BOMB!!!!,"I couldn't put this book down. I find that Bunny Wilson is an annointed woman of God appointed to guide and aid women (of any marital status) into the TRUE will of God. If you think you know what submission is and find it difficult YOU need this book. I found myself in every chapter of this book. Submission is presented here in a way that I had never thought of before. After reading this book I am now willing and equipped to be empowered by submitting to God, the government, my employer and my future husband just as Christ ordained me to. Thank you Bunny for this wonderful book!!!!"
3,I thought there was more help in this book,"There are some statements that let me know that I am not alone as a newlywed in learning my new role, but nothing breakthrough or eye opening that I didn't already know or learn. The book is just as much about submitting to your boss as it is in marriage. I just needed something more radical, hence my 3 stars. I wanted to love it, but feel only lukewarm and completely unchanged after reading it. Submission isn't a problem for me, I just wanted more knowledge and support in growing into becoming and staying a Godly wife, led by a Godly man. Ehhh. Ehhh. I'm in the same place I was when before I read the book."
5,Excellent,"The book was like new, the book arrived to my home very fast. Thank you for great service."
4,"Action, Mystery, History","There already are plenty of reviews about particulars so I'd just like to add that when I needed to escape into a world other than my own, Goodwin provided a multifaceted place full of adventure, information, Middle Eastern cooking, strange, foreign settings and well developed, likable characters. I've loved all three in the series so far - his last being too far fetched at times, though. That's not to say I didn't thoroughly enjoy going along for the adventure packed tour of historic Venice through the eyes of a Turk. Goodwin's books are for me pure joy and escapism."
3,The Janissary Tree: A Novel,A decent book. The hook is the time and place. I recommend the book if you're especially interested in the Ottomans or Turkey in general.
2,A can-live-without book,"Maybe I was unclear as to what I was buying (into?) here, but this book was a real disappointment.Truly little, with fairly juvenile humour, as far I'm concerned this book is only suitable for toilet-side reading material or, if really stuck, a stocking filler. But giving it a miss altogether would not leave a huge gap in your life."
2,Similar Experience,"I also fell into the trap where these were Amazon recommended after I did a very specific search for speakers and I bought them without doing further research. I thought it would be a nice easy install but when I received them, I realized that they do not fit my 2001 F-150. The quality of the product is fine its Amazon's recommendation engine that failed me.Very disappointed."
2,Alpha06,"This product did not work for me. Not that it is a bad product,you must make sure that you choose the right adapter for your truck. I have an 05 ford truck and this is not the right adapter for the trck."
2,Nice but doesn't fit my Ford,"Nice bit of kit, but it doesn't fit my Ford. I have a Mercury Mystique and wanted to avoid hacking up a harness. This didn't do it. I probably should have investigated a bit more before ordering, but a fitment guide would be helpful."
1,Buyer Beware.,"I waited a week to get the wire connectors in to install my new speakers, the connectors were suggested by Amazon in a group buy with the set of 4 pioneer speakers I order for my 05 F250.Description said it fits ford but you don't find out that the product doesn't fit 2000 year models and newer until after the product arrives and you read the package.Needless to say I'm very dissapointed."
4,A pretty good book!,"A very good book, showing how two worlds can be so distinct, yet come together and get along at some point in their history. Powerful story line, with great characters, and easy to follow, yet complicated in it's own punish way"
3,Great for Math Section,"The back of the book is great - especially the math part. It gets straight to the point and tells you EXACTLY what you'll find on the exam.However the verbal and written parts are not as well covered. I do like their idea (maybe other books use this too?) of grouping the vocabulary words so that you know a more general definition for a lot of words rather than an exact for a few, if you are in a hurry it's a good way to study vocab."
1,Horrible to work with,"I have a PC and I found the CD and the online help frustrating. The online help would not register right and I had to call the help number to set it right because the book I bought had a misprinted key number in the back. The book has many errors that are corrected only on the online site, and the site itself is a bit confusing to use. The book overall has some nice examples of questions to help you get a feel for the test, but you can download a sample test for free from the GRE website that is better than this book. The only useful thing I found from this was a printable sheet of vocabulary words. I would recommend looking elsewhere for GRE prep help."
2,Typos,"The review that this book provides is helpful, however it has many typos, that can get very irritating when trying to test yourself. For instance, some of the headings are in the wrong place, and some answers are clearly marked wrong, with a contradicting answer in the explanation. Kaplan needs to get a new editor before their books can get a better rating in my opinion."
2,Full of Errors,"Supposed to be instucting us toward ""flawless"" GRE performance??? How can they charge that much for something with an inexcusable number of errors? I printed the corrections sheet from their website which covered only a few of the many errors in the book. In the section on ""tricks"" to doing GRE math problems, I found ways to solve the the practice problems that were missed in the answers section! (And I didn't do all that well on the math part of the test.) What does this tell us about the level of the people writing the answers?! Sorry, but it's just annoying! These people are making the big bucks off all of us!"
4,good little epilator for first time users,"I've never tried an epilator before (nor have I tried waxing). I've always been afraid of the pain, and didn't want to try. But recently I was trying to look for a more long term solution than shaving. After reading lots of reviews on many types of epilator, I finally decided on trying this one. I've only used it once so far, and so far so good. It evoked much less pain that I've expected. Afterall, it's pulling hair out of our skin, so you can't expect no pain. To me, it felt like a light pinch whenever it caught a hair. I don't have much hair on my legs so it took me only a couple minutes to use it on both of my legs. One thing I've noticed is that it left little red dots on my legs (which I thought should be pretty normal when hair is being pulled out). It did cut a few hair short, rather than pulling them out completely. I guess I have to wait a week when they grow back out and try again."
3,Good job but......,"I bought this product about four months ago and it does a great job but I have not been able to tweeze my underarms and bikini line its very hard to think of because each time I try, the pain is beyond words, so i have left those that way and kept shaving. I dont know how people do it. I guess my hair is too thick and deeply rooted. I probably should try electrolysis first or somthing. But overall, it is a good product."
2,Oh well....,"It is just an ok epilator, not too good. I had to spent several minutes on each small area trying to remove hair and that is with years of epilating experience that I have. Even though there is no cord (which is a plus) I would not buy it."
3,great handbook for raku,"Long considered a handbook of raku, Raku; A Practical Approach details a myriad of topics pertaining to this method of firing.*Glaze recipes for many different raku effects*Extended chapter on kiln design, construction and operation*Information on how to do raku safely in a school or workshop environment.Raku, a ceramic process originating in Japan, involves taking a pot from the kiln with special tools at the height of the glaze firing, and putting it into a metal container filled with combustible materials. This is a dramatic operation, requiring a team of people, all garbed safely and moving in time to the firing schedule. It results in red hot ware clutched in tongs being carried from place to place- often bursting into flame as the pots contact the combustible leaves, sawdust or shredded paper. As you might imagine, there is much preparation that leads to this firing.Raku; A Practical Approach details the whole process of producing raku pottery."
1,I can't believe this thing is still in print,"Even when this book was first published it was inadequate for use as a text in undergrad molecular spectroscopy courses.What's wrong with it? It provides the barest, thinnest introduction to the subject that you'll ever read. The treatment of the mathematical aspect is superficial to say the least. In short, it's just not rigorous enough.For those of you considering a proper text look at:1. Modern Spectroscopy by J. Michael Hollas2. Symmetry and Spectroscopy by Harris & Bertolucci3. Spectra of Atoms and Molecules by Peter F. Bernath4. Molecular Spectroscopy (Oxford Chemistry Primers) by John M. Brown5. Molecules and Radiation: An Introduction to Modern Molecular Spectroscopy by Jeffrey I. SteinfeldFor those who DO want a skimpy book try:1. Basic Atomic and Molecular Spectroscopy (Basic Concepts In Chemistry) by J. Michael Hollas2. Foundations of Spectroscopy (Oxford Chemistry Primers) by Duckett & GilbertCheck out my other reviews for other chem books."
1,Unable to Recommend or Review,"I apologize for not being able to recommend or review this product. The order somehow got lost during delivery and was never received by the intended recipient. I contacted Amazon and the company issued a refund as they were unable to fill the order as it was on back order and no specific time frame was known for replacing the item. Sorry Amazon/Caswell-Massey, I imagine that the product would have been a great purchase as any Caswell-Massey product is usually rated very high. They have been in business for many, many years."
4,nicely done!,"man let me tell you. this cd brought back so many memories of that great sound. although i think some of the soloists sang too hard and tried to do too much it was still a nice piece. i wish the soloists would've sang their parts exactly how they did in the 80's and 90's, but i know that's kinda hard. it is still a must buy if you like choir music."
1,This one failed after 10 minutes.,This failed after 10 minutes. I sent it back to Amazon and they are always great and issued a credit. I ordered another one from someone else through Amazon and it works just fine so far.
1,Does not work,I do not feel it worked for me. I am returning it. I did not find any difference in my pain.
4,Light Therapy,I use my Light Therapy every day. I am having less pain. I would recommend this item for neuropathy in the feet.
2,Nothing more than a heating pad.,"Just a heating pad with a timer. The blinking lights, that's it blinking led lightsWould not recommend it to my friends."
2,Not worth the money,"Hi Everyone,I recently got one of these from a concerned friend. She thought that it may work for me as it did not for her. I have several injuries ranging from knee arthritis to tendonitis and others. I tried this product on all of them and was very disappointed. I got some very mild relief from pain in my knee but my heating pad is much more effective for this. The actor they use as a professional spokesman seemed to me to be very trustworthy. I was very surprised to find out that this is nothing more than a glorified heathing pad. In fact as I said my heating pad works better. This product did not work for me or my friend. Please people do not waste your money. Buy a heating pad instead.Best Regards"
1,Shady company,I purchased this product for my daughter (a swimmer) several months ago using the websitedirectly. I used a credit card and paid in full. The receipt I received did not contain any itemizedlisting or even the amount billed to the credit card. That should have been my first warning.It took more than three weeks for the product to arrive. The unit doesn't get incrediblyhot which was a major disappointment. Lukewarm at best.Now I'm getting billed for some remaining balance which has never been explained whatit's for. What a pain to deal with.Whether this product is listed at Amazon or any other place - I would definitely NOTrecommend it and to stay clear of this company. Just use a heating pad and save the bucks.If you are thinking this is anything like what you can find at a physical therapist office when theyapply heat to sore muscle areas - then you are sadly mistaken.
2,Did not work for me,"When I saw this product on TV, I thought that it would be perfect for me. I have been having some problems with my foot that resulted in a lot of pain and hoped that it would help. Well, as much as I wanted it to help, it did not. I ended up sending it back because after 2 weeks using it every day, I did not see any change in my pain. I am glad that I got it from Amazon, I was able to return it and they quickly refunded my money. Thank you Amazon!"
5,Amazing results,"This unit has really helped us with pain of all kinds, including intestinal discomfort, strained muscles, and arthritis. We are very pleased with it."
3,DL Chronicles...I could take it or leave it,"The Frist Season of DL Chronicles gives us a good insight of what some of our Brothers are up to but it still leaves us wondering why and how can I tell who belongs to this secret society. Additionally, this season was short. Good entertainment if your interest is in this area but it leaves you still needing answers to your questions."
5,Thank you -- excellant,Since I was a self taught theorem painter and was very hungry for history of this art. I was pleased to see the work done by the authors. I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in doing theorems. I especially enjoyed the work they did on the history of this art. I am the only theorem painter in a 200 mile radius of my home. To find a book about it was exciting.
5,desert island classic,"The first bit of this cd is distinguished by some of the most haunting violin music I've ever heard, segueing into gorgeous synthesizer. A real treat, I've been listening to this for nearly 30 years now."
1,*&^%$#@ CRAP,I bought the 1st edition of this book and it readlike a jamBOREe of adolescent naughty boys trying tosee who could excrete the most crap to fill their cretanskulls. I did like the original cover of HPL by Peter Smithso I cut off the panel and had it copied and enlarged and is now hanging on my wall. I put the book in recycle and realized later I really should have put it in the garbage.
1,Grills and plates don't last,Have to replace these almost every year. Got to be a better way. They just rust out once the heat gets to it. Wish they make these better.
5,Excellent virtual tour,This is a great addition to your visit to the Navy Museum. This DVD would also make a wonderful gift for the retired Navy officer in your life. Beautifully shot and Lou is the perfect guide.
5,Love these,"They were perfect and definitely more than paid for themselves already! Don't have to worry bout spilling liquid and, coming from someone who lives on a farm in Kentucky, they keep mud and snow off your carpets 100%"
2,They sent the wrong disc,"The packaging-- and even the disc-- was printed ""Bruckner."" But the content was Beethoven. Hats off to Amazon for promptly giving me a refund. Even more than before, I'm a loyal customer."
4,Looking for information,"I was looking for information on options and I came across this book. After looking at it I thought it would be just right. This is definately a hard core study on options. I would suggest getting the accompanying workbook. When you buy this prepare to take notes. This and one or two other books will definately prepare you in understanding options, valuation and where/when to create options. I only say one or two other books to re-inforce what you read and to potentially fill in any gaps left behind. I don't think there are any gaps besides advanced strat. It also assumes you have some basic(rought) knowledge of options."
1,"Attempt to make presentation ""hip"" fails badly.","This book is one of the now ""must"" tomes that seems to be filled with unnecessary and ""hip"" sentences to make the size and warrant the price. I found it entirely impossible to understand, and think the authors got lost in their verbosity."
5,A good purchase,"I recently purchased this cooling rack. It looks good, cleans up easily, and the bread i bake does not stick to the surface. Calphalon definitely puts out the best products in the market!"
3,Hokey but works,"As the vague descriptions say, this goes on an existing phone between the Handset and the phone base.It works pretty well but not Ideal. you can't pickup or dial out with any conference phone hooked up to this thing and the volume switch is seemingly random. (on ours it's High | 2-3-1-4 | Low) so this forces everyone to pick up the receiver and set it down somewhere and then dial their number, and whatever conference code they need then go turn on the conference room phone to hear and speak.it's a bit convoluted but works. Sure beat paying big bucks to re wire that particular to be analog instead of digital.But if you are looking for simple, just put in an analog line and be done with it."
3,Forceful drama without tonal beauty,"Daniel Börtz is a modern Swedish composer who has published serveral operas. This recording was made at the same time as the complete opera, directed by Ingmar Bergman, was filmed for televison and VHS. I haven't seen a live performance, but I looked for this recording because the main roles were taken by well-known and famous Swedish opera singers, all of them appointed Royal Court Singers: Laila Andersson-Palme, Berit Lindholm, Sylvia Lindenstrand Peter Mattei and Ingrid Tobiasson, to name a few.After the first night at the Stockholm Royal Opera House, Börtz was hailed as an important opera composer. The recording is interesting mainly through well-performed main roles. This is a modern but romantic opera, not atonal in any way. As if hearing a Swedish ""Elektra"" (Richard Strauss) but without that opera's tonal beauty. In fact I find the musical terrible. I can't stand it. The three stars are for the eminent singers."
2,very light weight,"I purchased these wrangler angler jeans and returned them to amazon because they were made from an extremly light weight fabric. I felt that for the money that they were not worth what wrangler charges. Being I still needed a pair of jeans I opted to purchase wranglers rugged wear ripstop fabric jeans. The ripstop fabric is somewhat heavier and roomier, not to mention cheaper in price. I am very happy with the exchange, so far all my dealings with amazon have been easy and fair."
2,"Nice read, but shockingly inaccurate","Waterloo Station is a pleasant enough read: short, light, the type of thing for a rainy afternoon. However, the dialogue all sounds American, what with ""sure"", ""you're welcome"", ""two thirty"". Trains from Oxford don't actually go to Waterloo--they go to Paddington. And the Independent newspaper was launched in 1986.But then, I'm a nitpicky old so-and-so!"
3,"It works, but it is not as pictured","We received the rotary cross slide table and were surprised by the age of the table. Although it is still in its original packaging, it is not the current model. My guess is that it is 15+ years old. The x and y movements are hard due to the age (it takes two hands). The unit will have to be disassembled, cleaned and lubricated. See the ""customer image"" that I uploaded for the actual picture of the unit."
5,A Fabulous collection!,"This is a collection of songs that covers the broad spectrum of love, loss, hopes, and dreams. This music truly is expressed from the heart. It is interpreted by an excellent group of musicians who attempt successfully, I believe, to express the emotions and music of this particular era. This is a must-buy for anyone who is a serious collector."
4,Diverse and Entertaining,"While a bit short, ""Model Prisoner"" is definitely worth buying. Adam Pascal, who created the role of Roger in ""Rent"", is one of the lucky artists who can put fervor and emotion into every single song on an album. Each song on the album is worth listening to every time you pop it into your player, but some (Undiscovered, Just Here to the Left of You) are better than others (The One that Got Away). If you're a Rent-head, an ""Aida"" fan, or generally a fan of rock or eclectic music, you'll definitely enjoy this CD."
4,"Good, but one big problem","The CD player works great, great sound and bass! And the CD is not easy to skip, the player even plays my CDs that have some scratches on it! But ... I have a problem with the CD player not remembering your place when you turn it off for a second (no pause). For instance, I have this player in my car hooked up to the cassette player so I can hear CDs while driving, but if I get out of the car for a minute like to pump gas, the whole CD starts over again and have to manually search through the songs to find where I left off. But if I'm driving around doing errands and stop frequently this is really a pain, but great for traveling longer distances."
4,Fit the Weber Genesis like new.,"My Grills thermoter has not worked right for a while and I finly broke down and bought another one. On getting the package, I was surprised to find that this is made to be removed from the frame and stuck into meats to determine how done they are. This adds to its value a litle. I think this was a good purchase and wish I had done it earlier."
3,Buy a digital...,"Unless you must have a Bi-metal Thermometer for some reason. 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, done!"
5,Really didn't need it!,"We ordered this product at the same time we ordered a projector because the website gave the impression that the projector did not come with a case. However, when the projector arrived, it did come with a case, so we ultimately had to go through the process of returning this product."
5,Highly recommended for business students.,"Hi, my name is Banggajam Velayudham. Currently I am pursuing an ABE business management course. Last term when I sat for my marketing Exam,My lecturer Ms.Chua recommend this book to me and I used the ""Introduction to Marketing"" by Philip Kotler and Gary Armstrong. This book is very good and act as a guide and has good notes and case stuides of the real business world with many pictures and particularly short notes on key points and it really helped me to get an A in my exam. I as student would highly recommed this book for ABE students. Thanks Mr.Kotler and Mr. Armstrong for coming out with such a wonderful boo,."
5,Awesomeness in plane form,I love my Sopwith Camel! The price and the details were both great! BUY THIS PLANE!
2,Too small...,I thought it said the plane was six inches. Its not. Its the size of a matchbox car. I was very disappointed.
3,Gem Trails still out of date,"Great guide. But, some of the narrative and maps are woefully out of date. We traveled 100 miles to visit one site only to find the road no longer passible and landmarks on the map non-existent."
4,great pen,love having pencil and ink available with a twist without having to go back to the pocket. Get to carry on less thing
4,Where is the thermomometer?,"Great product! I have found it easy to use and it makes great Q! I really wanted to give this little gem 5 stars but it lacks a critical piece of equipment that no smoker can do without... a good thermometer! It's like buying a sports car without a steering wheel! [...].I love the large amount of cooking surface. You are easily able to smoke a large turkey and a 10 pound brisket at the same time.Since I have started using mine, both my brother and best friend have also purchased a WSM and both have had nothing but good things to say about their smokers."
5,"You won't pay for ribs at restaurant anymore, if you have this!",I've made 5 tea-smoked duck in this at the same time. I've smoked ribs and other cuts in this. You'd be amazed what you can do with low heat cooking/smoking. It's definitely worth two hundred smackaroos that I paid for it.
3,Weber 2820 Smokey Mountain Cooker,I was expecting the current model with the temp guage and larger water pan not old inventory.
5,This is one sweet little smoker,"I have looked for a smoker for some time, ruling out the Weber because of its price. Then my wife suprised me with the Weber 2820 for my birthday.Set up and assemby takes about 5 minutes. The shell of the smoker is a heavy guage enameled steel. The racks are sturdy and heavy guage steel also.One caveat, I normally use a gas bbq so haven't purchased charcoal for some time. Without much thought I picked up a bag of 'matchlight' type of charcoal. The manual does warn about not using lighter fluid. Well my first batch of smoked ribs had a distinct lighter fluid taste and smell. Go with the regular briquets.You can really load up the two racks with meat and fish, do use a meat thermometer to insure not over or under cooking.I didn't get this smoker with the intention of bbq'ing or steaming, so can't comment on that.But I can tell you that this in a fine little smoker!!!!"
4,Great smoker with few complaints,"The Weber is a great little smoker. I have been smoking for 2 years now, year round, with is smoker and feel I am qualified to share my opinions and thoughts on this smoker.Pros - It is inexpensive, not to hard to use and turns out some very good BBQ. If you don't want to spend a ton of cash and are just cooking for friends and family the Weber is hard to beat.Cons - No Thermometer. Now I know they have finally put them on the other models but this one does not have one and that is ridiculous! Temp is the most important thing in smoking. Next is the fact that it does not have handles on the side for when you have to put more coals in. This would have been very helpful. Lastly is the legs. They suck! Mine folded in about 1 1/2 years. So I rigged my own. No problems since.So over a great little vertical smoker that puts out some great tasting, moist BBQ.P.S. - If you pack that sucker full you can get 40 pounds of Pork Butt in it."
5,Superb Results,"The WSM (aka bullet) cooker is an excellent product for BBQ novice and master. Consistent temperature make this a great 1st smoker for anyone who wants to make their own real barbeque. Easy to clean, a joy to use."
1,I call shenannigans!,"This item at more than 300 is not different than the one that is universally sold for between one-hundred-fifty and two-hundred Bux. Searching this merchant (which is not amazon) is the only one offering it on the web for such a price, and they disagree with themselves as to how much the 'retail price"" is.All that said - any outdoor cooking enthusiast should have one of these, especially if slow smoked ribs and BBQ are what you like. It is easy to use, cleans up well, ships with a good cover, and turns out professional quality results - I don't even like to buy BBQ anymore, since I know mine's better.Get it, but dont' pay more than 199 (less if you can!"
5,Using for 2 Years and Still Ecstatic,I purchased this smoker through a link on the excellent website http://www.virtualweberbullet.com/. (Same cost but you help support this great web site.) The temperatures are very stable I can even smoke in the winter or the rain. I feel comfortable letting this smoker go all night to cook brisket.My only quibble was that I had to modify the bottom so it easily works as a grill too. Combine this with a chimney starter and you are set.I was hesitant about buying this but it has been worth every penny.
2,Disappointed,I purchased this because it was a Sony thinking it would be able to take the beating I would give it trying to listen to tapes while weeding strawberries several hours a day. It worked fine the first month or so and then the sound began to distort like it wasn't getting enough power. Even with a change of batteries it did the same thing. It is comfortable to wear but the headset would slip a lot while I was bending over so had to wear a hat to hold it in place. I listen to books on tape so sound quality isn't a priority but being able to understand the words is! I'm now looking for a replacement which will meet my needs.
4,great apron for the price!,"I ordered 3 of these aprons for use on the KCBS BBQ circuit, and would have preferred a slightly heavier fabric. However, for the price, these aprons are great."
1,"Simpley put, hate speech!","Nothing but a ranting of a person trying to paint Islam as hatful. I can write the same one sided BS about Christianity and Judaism and any other religion. He has selected passages and has presented it as he wants to see it, just like terrorist that have high jacked Islam to promote their own ideology.This book is a waste of time, space and energy."
2,Careful when freeing your mind,"""Professor of Islamic History"" is not exactly something that makes one an expert on Muslim beleif. Theres a wide array of doctoral programs out there with respect to Islam (i.e. - Quranic Arabic, comparative religion, Islamic theology) These PhDs routinely meet, as do Christian PhDs of different aspects of that faith, to collectively make decisions on matters or to seek eachother's input before making any rogue judgements. I do not see that in the case of Mr. Gabriel.Say for instance I attain a Phd In Christian History, would that qualify me as a master in Christian doctrine? Question sounds rediculous doesn't it?Aside from that, I am sure there's some value in learning about his perspectives and life experience but I wouldn't take his assertions wayy to seriously unless varified by someone more well-versed in the area of theology."
5,Revealing the Koran and terrorists in simple language,"Dr Gabriel reveals the Koran and terrorists in simple language for what they stand for. He provides facts from his real life experiences. He was a devotee of Islam from childhood until he realized the teachings in the Koran were not the teachings of love and tolerance but the teachings of hate and intolerance. He was trained in Egypt's finest university in religion and Islamic history and thus knows first hand the hate and intolerance propagated by Muhammad's teachings. Because of his conversion to Christianity, he is able to make valid comparisons between the teachings in the Koran and teachings in the Bible.This is a ""must read"" book for those looking for understanding about the conflicts throughout the world between Muslims and other peoples. You will understand that these conflicts have nothing to do with poverty and land but have everything to do with the Koran and its teachings."
5,Absolutely on track,"The author addresses the true goals of Islam. He explains from the view of one who was raised in the ""faith"" the truth and the dire dangers to the rest of the non-muslim world.I hope its not too late"
1,i just read the review of the book Mr Robert,"""The book takes the reader on what it describes as a guided tour through 1,200 years of Islamic history where examples are illustrated that ""justify"" the killing of even women and children.""i really dont know why you or the writer is trying to prove here.But you and people like you who seemed to be interested in finding out about Islam, and love reading books should certainly read the Quran and with its extended translation of each surrahs instead of spending time reading petty books like these. Thank You.Mohammad Atif Zafar"
2,doesn't fit a narrower door,"I was excited to learn about a sweep that would automatically rise and drop when a door is opened and closed. I was disappointed to find out that the Seal-O-Matic Sweep cannot be cut down to a fit a narrower door without sawing off the mechanism. The manufacturer, whom I contacted by phone, said the device couldn't be cut off more than 2 inches, which doesn't suit my 32"" door. He said get the Flex-O-Matic, so I will try that one."
4,No More Draft,"It's a little tricky to install - read the directions more than once! When it's done, it couldn't be better."
1,Poor Quality,"This item is quite flimsy and poor quality. If you have weatherstriping between the door and frame, the mechanism to deploy the door sweep will not meet up properly. I was unable to use this for my front door. Instead I went to Home Depot and purchased a fixed door sweep. I would not recommend buying this product."
3,"Good idea, but less than ideal implementation","This product took way more time to install than I had hoped for. The small plastic button that presses on the door jamb broke while I was trying to adjust it. I had to install a nylon screw in its place. It was very hard to get the sweep to contact the floor uniformly across the door. The side nearest the door jamb just refused to fully extend the same amount as the door knob side. After a lot of fiddling around with it I finally got it to work reasonably well. I like having the functionality of the door sweep; however, I wish it were made a little better."
1,Can not play it...beware!!!!!,This is a SHAM!!!!!! Can not be played on all computers and I can not get a refund........!!!!!! Thought I was purchasing a DVD
2,Depressing,"It's a shame for Jennifer Aniston to be in this movie. It's very depressing, it should be called Death Happens. It was more about death and how he was teaching people to deal with losing a loved one when he hadn't dealt with his own wifes death at all. So what he was doing was covering up his own pain by starting up this workshop/book so that he could help someone else and by doing that he was blocking out his own misery and pain. It didn't rock my boat"
2,Story line was lame.,The topic involved dealing with death and moving on with life. Not exactly a fun topic. I like the actors but I didn't care about the characters at all. The best part about this movie was Seattle. I love visiting Seattle so it was fun to see places around the city that I recognized. I even fast forwarded through some of it just to make the movie end sooner. Disappointing.
3,faafafa,"took forever to get here but this show is part of my child hood, but it took forever to get here"
5,Mix of fast pace action and black outlook on humanity,"Per describes an island society that has embraced all of the 60/70's ideas (in extreme) - but can only survive using the free market (which it, of course, abhors). On the mainland a group of generals sets out to bring the island back under their control again."
3,Nice stories written in a very annoying manner.,"I was looking for a series of Amar Chitra classics that I remember reading when I was younger. And not being to find them anymore, I thought I'd try this book out.The stories are similar to what I remember reading when I was young. But it is written in an irritating manner. You'll find one story encapsulating another story which encapsulates another story and then it folds backwards to finish the first story - many, many pages after it first began. And they do that again and again. So much so that it became burdensome to read this after a while.What a pity, because the stories are nice. I just never remember it being told like this before. And with so many interjections of other stories inside stories. Still, given that it's hard to find nice stories of folklore from India, you might be hard pressed to find better books. But be warned about the irritating style in this book."
5,"HOT, HOT, HOT","Luke Lawson is a hunk. He's a journalist who also writes sex advice columns for many men's magazines under the name of Lance Flagstaff. As Lance, he has just published his first book, Sex for Total Morons. Luke's mail keeps getting mixed up with his upstairs neighbor's, Shari Wilson. When Shari brings down a padded envelop addressed to Luke, she plans on asking him out. They've been flirting for weeks and she's ready to take things up a level. Then, Luke's book falls out of the envelope she's handing to him and she thinks he's a real loser. Luke convinces Shari that he needs her help to work through the sex manual he received and since she's attracted to him, she agrees.The sex scenes in this book are hot. It is a little far fetched that Shari keeps believing that Luke needs the sex manual after the way he heats up the sheets, but overall it's a good book."
1,THERAPY,WHAT THE HEART CAN'T HIDE IS A REMAKE OF ALL THAT GLITTERS. THE HEROIN WAS WOODEN AND FORGETTABLE. THE GUY NOT THE HERO WAS A JERK. I HAVE NOT BEEN A FAN OF LINDA HOWARD'S FOR A WHILE BECAUSE THE MEN ARE USUALLY TOO FORCEFUL AND THE WOMEN ARE USUALLY SEXUALLY ASSULTED OR ABUSED IN SOMEWAY. I DON'T NEED THIS IN MY ROMANCE/ACTION BOOKS.
5,Outstanding reading experience,"The book is a transcription of lectures delivered by Ms Kubler-Ross to live audiences. Her messages are very direct, avoiding redundant references to commonplaces.I see the book split in 2 big segments: (1)learning about natural fears and acquired fears in order to be able to master the fear of death and (2) Understanding the importance of unfinished businesses and the need to clean them for better enjoyment of life."
4,not a bad werewolf flick,"This movie stands out among the Howling sequels as the only one with any quality to it. The others range from silly (Howling 3) to downright unwatchable (Howling 2). Although it has nothing to do with the original film, Howling 5 is both gripping and scary- rarities for late 80's B-grade horror flicks."
4,Wonderful Ives,I especially like this CD for the very fine collection of Ives songs. The piano work is done by Kirkpatrick; an original friend and interpreter of Ives.
2,"An inflated attempt to exalt the female form - in all its spotty, crinkled, cellulite glory","I'm not of the Oprah/self-help persuasion that this book tries to please but I sense that those who are will enjoy the myriad of essays that assure women that your body looks good, sans exfoliating scrubs, nips and tucks, laser treatments, gastric bypass, and whatever expensive fix the body police dream up. There is a hint of variety - including requisite entries by an exoticized Indian American, a disabled transsexual, and a short woman - but a disproportionate number of essays address the preoccupation with weight and few are particularly well written. Read it if you are indulging in a half-pint of Ben & Jerry's in front of the telly, your hair's twisted in knots from a bad perm, and a pound of goop is smothered over your T-zone; otherwise read a real book."
1,??????,"This book was recommended by a psychiatrist to help me with my poor self image, due in large part to my obesity. I just don't get it. The stories did not inspire me at all, and I couldn't even finish the book. Maybe I'm the wrong audience for this book, because I'm not a feminist per se nor a lesbian."
3,A grille from yak yak,"I used this in Vietnam, where the local butcher, Hang Kau Pung, asked me to use my gas grille for his yak. After butchering it, we used the grille to smoke it and had a problem when the ribs did not fit on the Weber 3601 Rib Rack. I had 5 Weber Rib Racks so they were useless and we had to put the cooked meat on the fly dirty ground near treated sewer water. I suppose if you are using pig Ribs they fit but be weary of larger meat animals."
3,Great Concept Poor Design,"Well as far as ""Smoking"" ribs this is not the best due to the fact that the Ribs touch each other....And for smoking that hinders the process. So you can only do 3 slabs of ribs carefully placed per rib rack....If the upright supports were more widely spaced and the rack was curved this would be perfect. People have said it is good for Chicken??? Then Maybe it should have been called a Chicken Rack instead?"
3,just hit the ball already!!,"Useful but Hank drops some terms and assumes the viewer is already familiar with them. Also, as the other reviewer states, the guy hardly ever actually HITS the ball! Doing so, would show the viewer the tips actually applied to the swing. I'm sure ESPN could afford to hire a kid to go get the balls he hit! Not an ideal DVD for a beginner but well worth the price I got it for on Amazon!"
4,Shipping shock,"The tool holder works well. There is a little leakage of smoke, but I don't think this reduces the quality of food preparation or changes the temperature of the grill. The tool holder ships from a company other than Amazon, and the shipping/handling costs are more than the holder."
5,From The Mind Of Stephen King,"I was very pleased with the DVD Nightmares and Dreamscapes; based on the short stories from Stephen King. I am so pleased this is one adaption of short stories from Stephen King which did not turn into a disaster. It seems like some of the movies that are based on Stephen King's novels just end up getting screwed up in the end; or they are a complete disaster period. I am so pleased this movie is one that survived like Carrie, The Shining, and Salem's Lot:D. My only disappointment is I wish they would have included more stories in the DVD, because most of the stories from the book were great. This DVD is a must have for any Stephen King fan, plus the price is right :).THX,Kris L. CocKayne"
1,There is one good show on this disc.,"It's the first show on disc one titled ""Battleground"". The teleplay was written by Richard Christian Matheson, he's the son of Richard Matheson, a well known and respected veteran writer. And he - R.C. Matheson - seems to be the only writer in this collection who knows how to write a teleplay. All of the other stories are either over written, under written or just simply nonsensical as is the case with ,""Umney's Last Case"", starring William H. Macy. I don't know if Stephen King is to blame for this mess or April Smith, who wrote the teleplay, but it is absolute garbage. It is the worst show of the bunch and considering its competition, that's saying alot."
3,Pretty wiggly if you don't crank the floor screws to the point of giving yourself hemorrhoids,This thing has play and not the 1/4 inch it's a bit play but movement in the 3-4 inch section as I load up my bicycles. I have quite a bit of money invested in my bikes and having the thing crash once when I loaded my less expensive bike on the lower section of the stand nearly sent me to hospital with fright. Ok so I have to crank the foot screws tighter... As I took to the screws on the floor with a crescent wrench and a pipe to extend the lever arm I was amazed at how close to crushing the drywall I came. I've put both bikes up and wiggled the center section in and out with that 3-4 inch play I have discussed. I'm sure loading and unloading the bikes during riding season will wiggle the stand despite my Herculean attempts.With everything bolted down to the point where anything more will strip the screws now all that is left is the passage of time...
5,As good as it get!!,This chimney starter is amazing. It lights ALL the coals easily and quickly. I bought this item because of the reviews and boy am I glad I did!!
5,A Father's Day Festiva!,"Holy Cow! My husband just loves this chimney starter. The shipment was free, arrived on the said date and in perfect shape.He has been using it every day since Father's Day. Just a great BBQ Accessory that I can't believe we did without."
5,"Excellent, a must have.","If you are using charcoal as a BBQ fuel, then you need this starter. It is easy to use, works great. In less than 30 minutes you will have well lit coals to enjoy your BBQ. I bought a 2nd starter to have when doing a lot of cooking to keep fresh coals available."
2,It worked- twice,"that's why 2 stars. For the first two times, I was impressed. Now it just won't catch fire. I end up putting starter fluid on it. I don't understand what happened to it. It pays to write reviews AFTER using the product a while."
3,"Gets coals going, but not a long-lasting fire.","I purchased this starter over two years ago and use it 10-15 times per year. Only once have three sheets of newspaper failed to get the coals going. In this respect, this starter is excellent. It's definitely starting to get rusty, but hasn't failed me yet.My only complaint is that by the time the coals at the top of the chimney are white and ready to go, the coals at the bottom have been glowing for 10-15 minutes. When I dump the coals, I sometimes find that the heat is not as intense or long-lasting compared to the heat and duration I get using the traditional pyramid stack doused with fluid. I recently reluctantly switched back to that pyramid method just to confirm my theory and I haven't gone back yet. With this chimney, I sometimes struggle to get thick hamburgers done, yet without it I have time to throw a second course on after the burgers are done."
5,Indispensable,This thing is amazing. 10 minutes from cold start to ready to cook. I use nothing but Kingsford so I always get great results. Can't vouch for brand X charcoal. This beats the heck out of lighter fluid.
5,Great quality at the Right Price,I would recomend this product to anyone. The quality is heavy duty and construction excellent. It should last a long time.
5,hot!,The design for these has come a long way since I bought my last one! The Weber Chimney starter starts a lot of charcoal much quicker than the old design. It is also safer to use with two handles. It holds a large amount of charcoal.
2,Hard to operate,Not enough instructions included. Left to figure out additional equipment needed to operate for first time user. Looks nice but not enough details on how to work with it. Need a lot of time to play with. If anyone can help with suggestions please let me know.
5,Finally,I have been waiting for this series to be out on DVD for a long time. I am so glad they finally decide to release the DVD set. If you grew up in the sixties like I did you can't wait for Feb 12th 2008. These are great cartoons. Thanks guys and I already pre-ordered mine.
5,George of the Jungle DVD,"Great to have the complete episode collection on one DVD, especially since it includes all episodes of Tom Slick and Super Chicken too. Video quality good, audio excellent. As an added bonus, I converted the toons to play on my iPhone to view in those times when you have 6 1/2 to 7 minutes to kill."
5,colt collection,this is a great item for the colts lover collection. it very well producedand brings back alot of great memories. i got to see footage i haven't seen since the game itself. they didn't have vcr's back then. so thanks for the memories. it is extra special now that they have won superbowl 41.go colt's. world champions always. god bless.
5,This grill cover has been replaced by 9859,"I bought a 2005 Genesis Platinum B and searched for a grill cover. I finally found the one you need for this grill. I bought a 9859 Weber grill cover. According to the insert in the package this cover is for Genesis Silver C (2-5500), Genesis Gold B & C, Genesis Platinum B & C (2005 models). Webers web site did not have this updated information on it. I was at Home Depot and they had all the covers. I bought this one and it fits perfect. It is a heavy cover with velcro adjusters on the bottom. The velcro adjusters don't allow you to get super tight but so far it has been good enough. I'm pleased with it. It cost me $60 though."
4,The 2nd Best Book Ever (Right After Silverwing),"This book is full of unanwsered information from Silverwing. After 2 nights of roosting the Silverwing colony were supposed to leave to find Cassiel, Shade's father, but Shade just couldn't wait. He, Marina, Chinook, another Silvewing bat, Frieda, the colonie's cheif elder, Ariel, Shade's mother, and Icarus, one of the bats last bats to of seen Cassiel, set off early to find Cassiel. While recently hit by lightning Goth, a cannibal bat, sets off to go to his homeland. Find out the secret of the bands, where Cassiel is, if Goth can destroy the sun, if Chinook will get adopted, and if Goth can make eternal night and return the equality of Nocturna an Zotz?"
4,Comprehensive book on Insecurity,This book cover internet security in an informal ways (conversation dialogue). Easy to understand for novice computer users.The only reason I didn't give a 5 stars is because I didn't learn anything new.
2,"Rust-prone, but nice design","Though Weber claims these are dishwasher safe, these rusted after a first run through the dishwasher. I like the way they work--personally, I didn't have a problem with the ""blunt"" tips. Everyone's right--they're not pointy, which to me (a klutz) is good because it saves my fingers. Still, I skewer veggies just fine all the time with them. In the future I'll handwash, and maybe see about calling Weber to complain about the rust."
5,GREAT brownies!,"This are a little more expensive than regular mixes but they are fat free and taste GREAT! They don't sell them where I live so I asked my mother, who lives outside of Chicago, to check the prices at her local grocer. Turns out these are about 50 cents cheaper per box at Amazon. I tried them with and without the egg white (egg white makes a more cake like texture) and they great either way. Definitely worth the money. I'm making a batch for Valentine's Day with some raspberry preserves on top."
2,"Tasty, but took hours to cook, wet inside","I'm not sure why it took about two hours in the oven to get these brownies to finally finish cooking. I used a pyrex baking bowl, at the correct temperature about 8x8 and they just seemed to stay drippy in the center. I did used a greek style yogurt, not sure if that matters. Does anyone have any tips or know what I did wrong?The aroma and flavor is fantastic. You'll never miss the fat, but watch the calorie count - it's still pretty high. Don't fool yourself into eating the whole pan.I later tried much cheaper Duncan Hines and substituted pineapple (puree'd) for oil. While not at tasty as 'No pudge' brand, it baked on schedule and tasted nice. Substituting pineapple seemed to give it a slightly more cake-like texture."
2,Not for me,"Based on the positive reviews I decided to purchase this fat-free brownie mix. As soon as the box arrived I made up a batch for the microwave. It smelled really good while cooking, but unfortunately I did not like the taste of these brownies. They were very bitter tasting to me. I am not a chocolate fanatic, so maybe that is why I did not like these.I am very grateful that Amazon bent the rules and refunded my money on this food item. I will be donating the remaining 5 boxes to an area food bank."
1,Terrible,"When first out of the oven, they had the typical box mix taste and were so-so, but they became even worse the next day when they became rubbery. Would not buy again."
5,absolutely delicious,cooks perfectly every time and is a real treat if youre not into the cakey taste of ordinary brownies but really want something fudgey that you dont have to eat too much of. perfect straight out of the oven over mint chocolate chip ice cream!
3,This book replaced by newer version,"This book was rewritten and republished in 1992 as ""Saber and Shadow"". The newer version is a much imrpoved book, and considerably longer to boot. It is part of the ""Fifth Millenium series, which is collectively written by S.M. Stirling, Shirley Meier, and Karen Wehrstein."
3,my boat,"It is a decent product and works for us but the fit is not very good on our Rinker. The elastic is of poor quality, in my opinion, and did not hold well after stretching, which it has to do in order to go over the seat. All in all, a decent option if you have bad cracked seats and do not want to spend $150 for new ones, but a temporary fix at best."
5,4 hours of Humor. Great spirit lifter,Awesome two pack. Made me feel better watching both of them back to back on a day home sick from work
5,EXCELLENT........WILL BE BACK!!!,Not only did this seller have exactly what I was searching for but it came to me SOOO SUPER FAST.It plays PERFECT and my duaghter is THRILLED...I will for sure be back!! Thanks a million...HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SELLER!!!!
5,BEST EVER,What can I say.. Disney has done it again. I have Toy Story I and am waiting for II but has got to be good plus you get 3 discs with extra features.
5,WONDERFUL!,"after watching these, you will try to find your old toys.youll be sorry for the ones which you have thrown away:((-- youll remember what they mean to you... just go and buy this set."
4,"Smooth graphics, good sound and even a nice story",This is a must have DVD for the special effects fanatics. It is almost like real and the sound is really nice. Buy it!
3,The Extras Disc,"I can not add anything to the praise and admiration for the Toy Story series and Pixar's work in general. This set certainly delivers. However, the extra's disc is the reason I went for this particular set, and it is extreme overkill. I actually lost count of how many clicks on the remote control it takes to navigate this disc. I started losing track after I counted 1,426...not counting the times I got lost and had to navigate my way out.They have managed to avoid all the heartbreak of editing on this disc. There are numerous unnecessary and repetitive sub-menus. How about a shot of a cardboard stand-up figure of a main character? Then how about a shot of it's blank backside? Get the picture?The value of the extras disc is diminished by by its lack of editing and consolidation and by a thumb thumbing navigational system."
5,Awesome movies,After searching for the original Toy Story movie I decided just to get the Collector's box. I read that the 10th Anniversary Toy Story was altered and I wanted none of that. My kids love this series and I'm glad I invested in the Ultimate Toy Box. I can't watch these movies enough. Timeless!Priceless!
5,"Big Fun, Fascinating Facts...","There is simply no better way to own these two masterpieces of modern animation. Both films are funny, engaging, and surprisingly moving in some places, while technically they stand as perhaps the best modern animation has to offer. But the real stand-outs of the Ultimate Toy Box are the extras - this is the reason DVDs are made. The Toy Box treats the two films exhaustively, from conception, to execution, to production, to marketing and audience reception. It is like taking a crash course in animation and film making from people who love what they do. By the time you are done exploring the making of these two films through the excellent documentaries and commentaries included in this set, you will love animated film-making too. Well worth the money, especially if you can find it second-hand (the set is now out of print), this is a must-own for any animation, film, or DVD lover. Forget the recent two-disc special editions and get the original great set."
4,Great Choice,"Was very nervous about purchasing a used DVD but was delighted when I received this one. Products were packaged very well, DVD's in great condition and it's been a pleasure being able to watch them without skips, scratches or other problems. Thanks."
3,fit is not great,got these for my 04 silverado with bucket seats they really don't fit great color was ok they tend to move around a lot and you have to keep adjusting them but for the price it will do
1,cheap quality,"all looks good on paper and when you handle the items, it is heavy enough too seem of good quality. However, as soon as it is exposed to oven temperature (350-400F) the pan consistently warps. It returns to its flat state after cooling off but warps again each time you heat it... Don't buy! there has to be better products out there."
3,Tube Amp Talk for the Guitarist and Tech,"This is a great book if you are looking for a""this component goes here and is suposed to do that"" type ofbook, also there are many good tips for servicing and repairingvintage amps but I was disappointed with the lack of anyreal info on how tube amps work. If you are looking for abook to learn how a tube amp operates....it's just not in there."
4,Striped piecing used for pieced borders,I have never used striped piecing in quilting. I am an old fashion scrap quilter. I know there are those that buy their fabrics so they always have enough. There is a lot of waste with the authors method. I intend to use this on baby quilts I am a firm believer in piecing the border. My way is tedious and I am looking forward to speeding up the process. A few colored pictures mostly black and white drawings. You still have to determine your pattern size.
3,Don't get too depressed when reading this book,"This book is a concise atlas of every environmental woe our planet has. Great for reference and research, but try not to read it too deeply; you might get a bad case of depression. It's a little too pessimistic for me."
2,Small poster,"When I was looking for posters, I figured this poster would the typical size of a poster but turned out to be quite small and a bit of a disappointment. Instead of being listed under a poster, it should really be considered a large ""picture."""
4,So true!,"This book basicly talked about a guy name Andy that deep down inside knew that he was suppose to be a female from day one. Then it want on to Andy changing his name to Candy and taking hormone pills. Candy eventally had gotten locked up and was built like a women. In jail he/she had all of the men flipping over he/she. Most of the men claimed they would never sleep with another man, but Candy found out that was a big front. From the muscle men, to the tough thugs, to the muslims, to the educated men, right to the chrisitan men they all went a piece of Candy. Each one of them had a price to pay with their life or hurting the person they claim to love. This book talks about how HIV is spread because so many people had secrets they would keep until their grave. Eye opener!"
3,Too Much Candy Is Not Good For You,"Convict's Candy is an interesting account of Candy Sweets, a man who wants to be female. As a result of his/her/ high flutin' lifestyle she becomes involved with various scams in order to pay for her surgery and to maintain her living standards. Due to a series of incidents, she is arrested and sentenced to prison. In prison, she is faced with many issues that will lead to a series of problems that affects not only the prison population but many more people affiliated with the prisoners that she is in contact with.Convict's Candy is a good story that has a powerful message that could help not only the African American community but anyone who may be practicing unsafe sex. The message is much needed. Meadows and Poole did a good job of detailing the antics of Candy however a good edit is needed to make the story more effective. Still though there lies an important message that hopefully will make a person think before engaging in unprotective sex with anybody."
4,Big clumsy remote,I would have given 5 stars but the remote is so big and clumsy!! I have been using for about a month and still can not get used to it!! The number keys are so far apart from the volume and channel up keys. Oh well it is still well worth the $$$. Awesome tv!!
4,Good ideas from an underrated man...,"Former Vice President Dan Quayle puts out a credible manifesto for conservatives, and many others concerned with the direction our country is headed, to rally around. Much of what he touts is mainstream, common-sense conservatism, but sadly, given his initial introduction to the American electorate, and the unrelenting (and unfair) attacks upon him by much of the Big Media, his views will never be given their due. Quayle won't be our next President, but this book lays out a foundation for our next President to begin to repair the damage done to the office in recent years, and to forge a better plan to combat our existing problems."
5,Quayle delineates the issues of the 2000 race.,"This is a must read for anyone planning to vote in 2000. Former Vice-President Dan Quayle spells out the important issues facing the middle class for the 21st century. From values to civil rights to foreign policy, He clearly reveals his views and exposes the liberal agenda of the ""New Aristocracy"" or ""Opinion Elitists."" The book was well organized, well documented, and read quickly."
1,Beware,"The description is wrong for other printers/mfc as well. The Brother website lists ONLY the following printers as compatible:FAX1840C, FAX1940CN, FAX2440C, MFC3240C, MFC3340CN, MFC5440CN, MFC5840CN"
3,Does NOT work with MFC-420CN,"While I can't promise that this cartridge won't work with any MFC-420CN (one of the previous reviewers claims it will), I can say that this cartridge did not work on my MFC-420CN. As soon as I swapped it out for a LC41BK, it worked fine. Since the LC41HYBK packing does NOT mention the MFC-420CN, I would avoid this ink if that's the printer you have."
3,CSpivey's Review - Bookcase Headboard,"Unfortunately, I have to report that the product I received was damaged due to shipping. The other disappointment is there was no contact information on the shipping package slip for me to call and report the conditions of the product. With that said, I need for someone to call me as soon as possible on the number provided when I purchased the item. I also noticed that you don't have contact information on this webpage; therefore, I will not be a returning customer."
4,"Good Yoga Session -- But not for ""Newbies""","I have been doing yoga at Kimberly Wilson's studio in DC for a number of years, and I picked up this CD to have something to use at home. It is a very good vinyasa yoga session. However, I would definitely not recommend this to those who have never done yoga before. The pace is pretty fast (in fact faster than the pace in the studio's Level 1 classes), and it seems to assume that the person has practiced yoga before. I would recommend going to around 10 classes before trying this at home -- otherwise, I think it would be pretty frustrating. That said, it goes through a good sequence of asanas. Downsides are (1) it is a little fast paced on a few of the sequences, and (2) I didn't think the music was all that great, especially in the beginning (mostly background piano music). But if you want a good vinyasa practice CD, this fits the bill! Kimberly Wilson is a very good teacher."
5,Vinyasa Yoga for the Newbie Yogi,"Thank You, Kimberly Wilson! As a middle school teacher & Yogi, I have students ask me about yoga often. Thanks to your CD, I have shown and worked with several students teaching them the many positive aspects of Yoga. The students are able to follow your instructions from the very beginning.Your calming voice and excellent instructions make this CD a must for any ""at home"" or ""on the road"" Yogi.With this and your first CD, I have only one request. Where do I purchase a DVD by Kimberly Wilson?"
2,Not for newbies!,"I can see where this would be a fine CD for intermediate level yoga practitioners, but I didn't find it user-friendly as a ""newbie."" If I hadn't already had 2 months of yoga class (4 days per week) I wouldn't have been able to correctly perform the limited number of asanas that I was able to do. I found this CD to move too quickly without offering in-depth instructions ~ with no assurance that I was doing the postures correctly and safely. My copy is currently for sale on the ""buy it used"" portion here. Hope someone else will find it more beneficial than I did."
3,Not Free SF Reade,"A decaying California? Basically, Robinson's weakest work, this lot. Not something I am interested in, in general. Three Californias is perhaps two and a half Californias too many, in this case. This is perhaps close to mundane. Orange County is not a nice place to start with, not too suprising it will be less nice in the future. Prefer others to this, particularly his newer books."
1,B O R I N G,"Quite possibly the most inept, inane and boring book I have ever read.Though the scientific explanations are accurate,the action (or lack thereof) is like molasses.The dialogue is 8th Grade English at best.The scenic descriptions are more than tiresome, they are irksome.And,after having read more than 3/4 of the book, it is hard to believe that the reviews were written by anyone who read past page 10."
3,Something is missing,"I almost put this down just past the halfway mark because it was becoming boring and routine, but then things finally perked up. The most irritating thing about this book was the repetition of a phrase by almost every character. The plot was fascinating, but there were too many instances of botched actions by the characters to where I kept thinking where do we go from here. Unfortunately this is not as good as some of his earlier novels but I keep reading his books as they come out, hoping they will get better again. This wasn't the page turner I that I was hoping for."
2,A Horrible Let-Down,"I used to be a huge Robin Cook fan. This novel seemed hastily thrown together and contrived. By the end of the novel I didn't care about ANY of the characters. Even with the so-called 'shocking' ending... the characters didn't seem to care what happened either.But shrowds, mafia hit-men, and Bahamian egg harvesting! (oh my!)This one will make me think twice before I pick up another more recent Robin Cook novel. If you want to really experience Robin Cook, read his earlier novels."
1,Agree with the others,"I am a dedicated Robin Cook fan. However this novel was awful. I kept waiting for something exciting to happen. The ending is contrived and we never get to hear any more about the characters. I will continue to read his books, but this one was really bad..."
2,Good Subject Gone Bad,"The premise behind ""Seizure"" by Robin Cook is one that is timely and emotionally charged. I fully expected a well studied story line of medical ethics and religiously skewed politics. What a disappointment.Within the first 50 pages the story becomes contrived and cliche'. Throwing a few medical terms around does not make for an intelligent book, and incorporating contrived mafia figures into the mix does not make for intrigue. Even the gratuitous love story is shallow and obviously as dissatisfying to the characters as it was to this reader."
2,"I didn't seize, I slept",Sorry Robin but this book was a sleeper. Many of the ideas were used and worn out in the author's previous books. A great hot topic but too over the edge.
1,newsflash: 8yr old ghostwriters penned this one!!!!,"midway through this shockingly BADLY written novel, i put it down!! after reading the other reviews here, i see i'm not alone in my opinion, but...even MORE startling: it's pretty pathetic when amateur reviewers write BETTER than the highly accoladed Dr. Cook, begging the question, ""did he use his advance to employ a staff of 8 yr old ghost writers! yes, the dialogue was THAT stiff and juvenile, the characters and plot THAT slimly drawn, making Seizure a total waste of money and time."
2,Seizure?,"Perhaps you may learn something of stem cell technology but it is not worth slogging through this very boring novel to do so. The story is predictable, lineal, corny, and without a single character to like or relate to. Seizure is a catchy moniker but is a red herring title creating anticipation of a story line and excitement that Cook never delivers."
1,Seizure,I listened to the unabridged audio tape version of this book. It was not until Tape 10 (it has 11 tapes) that the implant operation even took place. The interaction seemd contrived and convulted. If it was in book form I would have stopped after the 3rd chapter. It was very disappointing after having been an avid Robin Cook reader.
2,too small,"this is a fantastic braceless but u can only wear it if ur a skeleton or something close to it. And the clasp is next to impossible to figure out how to open....i finally did get it open. I think that someone should let the people know how TINY it is before they go waste their money on it. Its nicely made, but there isnt much of it."
4,Surprised to be listed,"My friend came across this book in a bookstore in Glasgow in 1994. The Internet was pretty different then but in any case he opened the book and thought I might be listed. There I was, next to President Clinton. I was rather more surprised to be listed than he was to find me. Anyway, now that the Internet is so much more widely used, everyone can have their 5 minutes of fame and we don't need a book like this anymore, after all anyone with the email address in a book is probably going to get even more spam than they already get. Still, back in 1994, this kind of stuff was quite good fun."
3,Alisson's dream came true,Once upon a time there was a little girl and her name was Alisson. Alisson was an orphan girl and she had no one to take care of her. She dreamed about people having great families. She dreamed she had one all the time that loved her and cared for her. Finnally a couple of years later she got a family. She was so happy and excited. Alisson found out they were loving and caring. She loved them too.
3,Palmgren sander,not that pleased with the sander it is a little lower Quality then what i was expecting. I would spend thge extra money and buy a better one next time. The belt dosent run true and the sanding platforms are not very sterty one was broken when it came out of the box. And the belt size is very hard to find havent found one any where in the stores yet must be special order.
5,Required Reading for Every Citizen,"I read this book around 2006. I believe this book to be a factual report on the author's research and to be highly credible.Frank Donner was a lawyer specializing in civil rights law. He died in 1993. I consider Mr. Donner to be a hero for writing this book.This book documents massive law enforcement law-breaking conducted over several decades. The Center for Investigative Reporting labels this book the ""definitive 1990 book on domestic intelligence gathering.""Every citizen of the United States should be required to read this book.People do not want to believe that law enforcement officers would break the law. But law enforcement officers allow their personal feelings and political views to influence their on-the-job behavior.This book is very detailed and has 78 pages of notes."
4,Nothing ventured - nothing gained,"The author, Micheal Hughes, does an admirable job weaving a tale of triumph over fear and self doubt in a setting where young men are restrained in a system of endless rules and oppression by their charges. Underlying the main character's passage from boy to man is a story of a corporate good deed gone haywire. Hughes does a fine job of intertwining the two into a light and funny story about life at Hershey Home for Boys. Anyone who has unwrapped the foil from a Hershey's Kiss will enjoy unwrapping the wit and humor in this book. I highly recommend it to young and old alike. It will inspire the young and cause those of an older age to reflect on their own passages into adulthood. The author has done a fine job on this, his first novel. I will look forward to his future works."
2,Great in thought,"I live in NY and get an abundance of snow, in theory this is a great product for sedans and for taller people. But once you actually use it and if the brushes get wet they clump up right away, or it gets to be too heavy. Not ideal for short people and ppl who do not want to have a workout just to remove snow from their cars. The only good thing on the product is the ice remover, but you definitely can buy any cheaper version that will do the exact same thing. No extension, so I would stay away from this one."
2,Very simple preliminary stuff,"This book is very simple and preliminary. I had bought this book with the intention of getting deep insight into feedback compensation networks that go in day to day power supply circuits. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. Even some general books like Switching power supply and Power supply cookbook have good amount of detail on compensation circuit. If you are a beginner, then this is probably the book for you."
3,Good buy for the Price,Guess I should have read that they were Synthetic and Bristle Stencil Brushes. I was expecting soft brushes. Although I brought these for my 3 year old so she really doesn't care or even notice.Other than my mistake these brushes are nice. Comes with a lot and nice sponges. MY daughter has had a lot of fun using these brushes and sponges. Good buy for the price.
2,"Stale and dated, actually boring","His ""handbook"" on copywriting is pretty good, so had high hopes for this, as I specialize in web copy and digital white papers.Sadly it failed to deliver in just about every way. It's actually a boring book, which from a copywriter is inexcusable."
1,Rip off,The cost is outrageous for one episode. I thought I was buying one season for my grandsons. Won't do this again.
2,Very disappointed,"I was so happy to see the great review on these pills that I threw caution aside and purchased a significant quantity of two flavors for personal use. I wanted to have extra for passing around to my friends. I eagerly tasted my coffee with the flavored pills; absent of carbohydrates, great for chocolate and caramel lovers. To my dismay, even with two pills, my coffee was still lack-luster. Neither the chocolate nor the caramel tasted like the real thing, just another ho hum imitation flavor assimilation lacking quality for the taste buds. In my opinion, these pills are not worth buying. This is too bad because such care went into the packaging. If the product had half the class the packaging does,I would purchase their product for my coffee shop."
4,Girls Bravo Review,"Awesome anime to buy on DVD. The copy I received was kinda beat up, and I don't know if that was because of shipping or it was already like that, but as far as the anime goes, and awesome anime to own!"
5,Excellent!!!!,It's nice to see Funimation re-release this series so those of us who like to collect anime don't get ripped off. This is a fun series ... definitely recommend adding this one to your collection if you haven't already!Can you say fan service. ... lol.
3,Measure carefully when you order this,If you are placing this organizer under a sink...measure carefully how deep the plumbing is...or you can't use it. I ended up separating the drawers and using them in other cabinets because they wouldn't go under the pipes.
4,John Christopher Smith: Tobit - Oratorio after Handel,"John Christopher Smith: Tobit - Oratorio after Handel is a recording under the direction of Joachim Carlos Martini who leads the Frankfurt Baroque Orchestra on this Naxos recording from 2001. This oratorio was compiled by John Christopher Smith and is a compilation from Handel's operas, oratorios and other works. The liner-notes have been written by Keith Anderson and are very well-written and informative. Recommended. 4/5."
4,almost great,"Now a world famous model, Raven had been a renowned undercover government operative until the day she was left for dead, betrayed by her superiors and by her former lover General Kalen Grady. Living in Paris and leading the high life while hiding from the U.S. military where she is considered to be AWOL she unsuccessfully tries to forget her love for Grady. Now Grady is asking for her help to destroy a ruthless Tong leader. In return she will be absolved of her crimes and allowed to return to her country.This story is the second in a trilogy by Jessica Hall. If not for the comparison to the first in the series, ""The Deepest Edge"" which was even more informative, erotic and suspenseful, I would give this one five stars. It is exciting, suspenseful and well written. The characters, who were introduced in the previous book are well drawn and likable. Jessica Hall demonstrates her knowledge of Eastern art and culture while telling a fascinating tale."
1,older DVD player? forget about it!,"This is not a professionally stamped disk, but more like a DVD you could burn yourself. It won't play on any DVD player that is old enough to not be capable of playing burned disks. I'm sure had I a chance to actually SEE this DVD, it would have been great. But unfortunately for me, until I go out and buy a brand new DVD player, that won't happen."
1,"Disappointing, Uninspiring",I unfortunately listened to to other reviewers of this product and tried to view it with an impartial and open mind. It was terrible; I cringed and I laughed. The acting and even the the way the actors looked was awful. I made myself watch the first episode all the way through; I have things to do and I don't need to see any more. There is a legitimate reason why it never made it past the first season.
1,Horrible....,"This show was a horrible piece of crap, the franchise should have died with Brandon Lee, but they keep on dredging up horrible movie sequel after sequel and this pile of crap TV show. I saw a few episodes and they all sucked. Let The Crow movie stand as a reminder of how big a star Brandon Lee would have become."
3,Cheap Meter works OK,"This hand held device works OK, it will tell you RH and Dew point very well but the temperature is always 8 to 10 degrees lower than actural room temps.If you really need true reading, don't purchase this one spend more cake and buy a better unit."
2,"Good for a bathroom book, but not much more substantial.","My biggest problem with this is the lack of detail. It's a fluff piece, pure and simple. There are some intriguing ghost stories in here, like the ones about the Comedy Store, but not nearly enough of them and with not nearly enough historical detail or research. It is far from comprehensive, as many Hollywood ghost-stories I've read about on line are not even mentioned here. Granted, if a book were going to cover EVERY single ghost story from the history of Hollywood, it would be a thousand pages long, but many of the most prominent ones are not even mentioned here. I read this for pure entertainment, since I do not actually believe a single one of these ghost stories, but the chapters were far too skimpy to give me much satisfaction. Since the author has supposedly been collecting Hollywood ghost stories for 10 years, this book seems awful light on facts."
1,Portrait of the Artist as a Young Psychopath,"Puh-leese... only the most credulous and most willing-to-suspend-disbelief could believe this book is anything other than personal fantasy. What are the tip-offs? The timeline makes no sense, for one. And my mind misgives the narrator's command of any idiom but English. It takes more than a talent for dress-up and self-promotion to authenticity make. I don't dispute that its an engaging page-turner; only that IF the author has ever been to Afghanistan or Pakistan at all, he did so as sponger-offer of other ex-pats' lives and experiences. The author meets all the qualifications on the ""Walter Mitty Checklist"": glibness, charisma, feelings of high self-worth, and pathological lying. He goes out of his way to proclaim it as a work of fiction, but at least 44 people on Amazon have concluded, as the author intends, that it is based on deep cultural and linguistic insight rather than role playing. This guy is a poser and a wanna-be."
1,"Haldex Hydraulic Pump - 11 GPM, 2-Stage, Model# 1001689","This was sold to as a new pump, but it sure look like a rebuilt one the front and back housing did not line up and the threads strip-out on the low pressure end before it was tight enought to stop it from leaking."
4,Excellent cargo carrier for the money.,"It works perfectly, it was easy to put together and the price was unbeatable.On the neg side I noticed that there is some play in the hitch connector, so it tends to jump and make some noise when not fully loaded, but I found a work around with some sheet metal inserts. I would buy it again and recommend it to my friends."
4,Agrarian Spirituality,"With a very easy-to-read voice, Cronin evokes a Christian spirituality that connects with the earth and connects with a lifestyle that many of us envy and strive to live, a lifestyle rooted in the seasons of the year and in the seasons of Christ. In some ways Cronin's work is for Christian spirituality what the work of the agrarian movement (the authors of ""I'll Take My Stand"") was to the world of literature. This book is a worthy contribution to both the academic world and to the everyday world of theology and spirituality. Make no mistake: Her work is not some nebulous spirituality rooted in the latest version of gnosticism. It is explicitly Christian and rooted in the author's understanding of God in Christ."
5,MY FAVORITE CD!!!!,"Let me tell you - I bought this CD twice because the first one got scratched up so bad I couldn't listen to anything. I LOVE LA NEF!!! My 132nd wish is to see this troupe live in concert!!! :DOkay. ""Music for Joan the Mad"" is about musicians stuck inside the queen's chamber trying to appease her insanity. If you read the bible - remember Saul & David? Sort of the same theme, only he had demons and she's just crazy.I LOVE THIS CD...nothing could appease this woman. She was mad because something happened to her love (her husband) and it drove her crazy. So she won't leave her chambers or the castle and insists on being entertained in her room.At the end of the cd, she's still crazy but you will fall in love with love with this troupe!!"
4,Flamenco goes symphonic,"Vicente Amigo, probably the leading Flamenco guitarist of his generation, with the assistance of the great Cuban guitarist, composer and conductor, Leo Brouwer, has created a blend of spoken word, orchestra and Flamenco guitar that has moments of outstanding beauty, rhythmic intensity, and emotional depth. While it does not represent a original contribution to Flamenco like the work of his mentor, Manolo Sanlucar, it has enough of Amigo's unique sensiblity and guitar wizardry to satisfy his fans. The one drawback is the orchestration, which is too derivative of De Falla and Rodrigo - why does so much Spanish orchestral music have to sound like ""Nights in the Garden of Spain"" or ""Concierto de Aranjuez?"""
4,Try again.,"Disney's Ducktales High flying Hero was Disney attempt to...try to accept Launchpad's popularity. They naturally picked two episodes that made him look especially stupid. This was easy, there were so many that did that.They picked Launchpad's civil war and Hero for Hire.They could have picked Launchpad's first flight and...can I think of one where they didn't try to make him look like a total moron? Sigh. I'll never know what kind of money they could of made if they accept his popularity instead of fighting it tooth and nail. And neither will they."
4,Pricey but probably worth paying for,"There's no room for a dresser in my tiny bedroom; these keep my trousers & skirts neat, folded and in easy reach. I found them very easy to use. The clamps are set far apart and will need to be slid inward for most smaller sizes. Not a problem for me, but they are a teensy bit sticky and might challenge someone older with arthritic fingers. However, a spritz of WD-40 or a grandchild should solve that problem, and once pushed to the right place, they stay there. My only other caveat is that ten dollars is a lot to spend for 4 hangers IMHO. Nonetheless, I will probably buy another one next paycheck."
4,would be five stars,"if the the bonus feature included more performances by all the other young talents, that would of been great! but it did not so i gave it 4 stars instead of five"
1,Same old format and same old music,"This is no different than any other Cliburn comp. dvd. Only the players are new. It is always the same music they perform to. Time for a change. Who wants to see a contestant skip rope, eat a taco, or put on a cowboy hat. This is what they show. Only a few of the contestants are featured so you know already who is in the final 6. I am tired of watching Texans all glittered up going-'Gosh, them Chinese play real well Ma!' It is like the late Alexi Sultanov-a past winner-said-'It's a gimmick to make $$$$$ for Cliburn."""
3,Caveat Emptor,"This is a State of the Art book.Unfortunately it is the State of the Art of 20 years ago because it is a republication of a public domain document from 1984. One does not get that idea from the publicaton date, however.I heartily recommend it for the historians looking to see what the current thinking was during the first Reagan administration. Others may want something more current."
5,Dead-on observations,"Bill Barich travels throughout the state, meets people, and describes California's various places. As a native Californian, it was interesting to see how he described the various people at the various places that both he and I have been. In order to be pithy, he has to distill a town into a short description, which risks greatly oversimplifying matters. Barich pulls it off amazingly well, with dead-on descriptions of many places. Readers may take issue with how he depicts a favorite place, but I think he manages to capture the feel of each place he goes. Definitely worth reading if you're from California or know someone who is."
2,Not The Best Resource,"Maybe I was expecting too much, but I really didn't get that much out of it. Most of the ideas are cheesey bordering on hokey. Don't get me wrong, I like cheesey, but most of the ideas were ones that I had already seen in the bridal magazines."
1,deteriorates fast,I only used the baking sheet a few times. It already lost the coating on the bottom and it has some rust on the sides.
1,Video Cooler,Barely pulls out any Air. No Temperature change at all. Equipment failed after 2 weeks. I would not recommend this product.
1,Worthless,"After installing this fan, I noticed minimal drops in temp. The sound at first was tolerable, definitely louder than before, but tolerable. Over the last two weeks the noise had gradually increased until I couldn't bear it anymore. I sent it back. I recommend investing in a more reliable product."
1,Inaccurate Description,"The description says that it fits ""any expansion slot"". This is also stated on the product packaging. However it does not even come close to fitting my PCI Express low profile slot."
3,"Did its job, a little noisy, died after 2.5 years.","This cooler was *ok*. It added a small bit of noise, but did measurably improve airflow. It just died on me after 30 months of use, which is not bad I suppose."
2,Worked well until it broke,"I purchased this product in June. The product I received did not look like the picture nor did it have Antec listed anywhere on the product. Despite my questions regarding its authenticity I installed it in my PC below the graphics card (which had been overheating during Bad Company 2). It worked great until October. At this time it started making a loud grinding noise when operating. I removed and inspected it and found when I turned the fan by hand it still made the grinding noise. I'm assuming it's an issue with the fan's bearings. Again, I would like to point out that I'm not sure I received the correct fan."
2,Decent product but very disappointed,"Being in the computer industry since the start of Compaq, I have sold a lot of Antec products. Just recently built a Intel i7 computer and just wanted a decent blower for secondary exhaust and picked up two of these.Works as I expected but I was very disappointed on the 4-pin male Molex connection, poorly fastened and when connecting it to the power supply female Molex connection, the pins was slipping out from the back and was very loose . Had to reinsert and align it to match the female side. That is why I gave this a 2-star."
3,Blood-thirsty story,An endless story of fighting the vampires told in a digitally-animated form. Irrelevant murders and killing for satisfying the special thirst for blood while simulating artificial sex-related situations just for making a break from continuing fighting and mutilating self-adjusting limbs.It exemplifies a perfect technical presentation of a poor script while showing vampire slaughtering in England.Fifty two minutes run fast-take three stars!
5,Very helpful and easy to follow,"It's been hard dealing with my father who is 97 years old and in an assisted living home - god bless him! He's so sweet but gets confused, paranoid, etc. and I was feeling overwhelmed. This book is nice because it's short and sweet, but it's got everything in there. I really liked the 10 step outline, it's so easy to follow. I've been able to read it out of order and find what I need for my own issues without feeling like I'm missing something."
2,Elder Care Made Easier,It was okay. It wasn't what I was expecting. I should have read the preview more carefully. Laid out well and easy to understand.
5,THE MOST CRAZE TV ON THE MARKET!,"I have the 42"" version of this HDTV and waiting on this 50"", and i can tell you that both of these products by Panisonic can stand in the B-Boy stance, wearing Addidas with no laces and big gold chains around there necks, because they are the bomb.i stared at many another HD sets, plasma, LCD. i couldn't come to terms with any of the ones i looked at. after reading alot of reviews i ordered the 42"" through Amazon, received it within the time promised and have been kickin it ever since. i can't watch Hockey or Football any other way. the xbox 360 looks amazing on this set, just don't pause it and leave it on screen...i return it to he tv feed if i have to pause. please no burn in!!!trust me, this set is of the highest quality and only the pioneer elite model got a higher rating from consumer reports (for more hdmi ports i suspect) but its $1400 more expensive. you will not be disappointed, don't spend your money on any other set! THE CRAZE MASTER COMMANDS YOU!!!!"
3,"Edges of Darkness, it should have been darker","I am a huge zombie fan, and will buy about anything with zombies in them. If this movie was 25% as interesting as the jacket cover it would have been a great movie. Sorry, I can't recommend this one to anyone who likes zombies. I wouldnt put it up for a Tuesday night with pizza and beer viewing. Save your money of this one."
1,Not one good thing about this movie.,This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I am a huge zombie fan and I could not stand watching this movie and I have seen alot of bad zombie movies. It has 3 overall storys and none of them are good. I could not find a single reason to care for any of the characters. The only thing that someone could like about this is the front DVD cover. Just look at that for a few min and then walk away. If you even think about spending money on this thing let me tell you you will get more enjoyment setting it on fire then spending any amount of money of this.
2,Like a horrible car wreck,"Acting and cinematography are terrible, but you can't help but keep watching to see how much more ridiculous things get. I would only recommend it, so as to make someone else suffer through what I had to go through."
1,"Echo, anyone?",Am I wrong? Does this plot bear more than a passing resemblance to 28 Days Later??? I am shocked the makers of this film were not sued for copyright infrignement.
3,Worked...but not for acne due to hormones,"I have never had an acne problem until I turned 30. Then, I started breaking out with anywhere from 2 to 7 pimples at a time. I couldn't believe it! It was very upsetting. I bought this book, and it DID impove the existing acne. But I still had breakouts. I started tracking the flare-ups by recording how many I had, and the date. I found it was related to my period and ovulation times, basically every two weeks the acne would worsen.It seemed as if hormonal imbalance was the cause. I also had other symptoms...anxiety, stress, etc. I started taking an herbal supplement..chaste tree berry..used by European doctors for centuries to treat hormonal problems. After 60 days, my acne is gone! And my stress and anxiety levels have been reduced dramatically.In summary, this book reduce the amount of acne I had. But it took the herbal supplement to truly end my adult acne problem. I also have noticed if I eat a lot of carbs, I am more prone to flare up."
3,Okay but the weight is misleading,"I'm kind of disappointed because I still have to assemble it. It says the shipping weight is 23lbs so I figured it would weigh less without the packaging but still close to 23lbs. It feels a lot heavier and I'm not a weakling. I lift weights and this feels closer to 40lbs. Still, it is lighter than most of the others out on the market. The main reason I went with this one was because it was supposed to be light weight making it easier for me to lift on and off. That is still TBD. I'll updated after I get it installed and use it a few times."
4,better,"better sound quality than gentle art of making enemies, and definitely was not expecting the rest of the album to sound like it did compared to the sample song i heard on a warped tour compilation mix."
5,Great tile for the price!,"I bought this tile expecting it to be a temporary solution for the kitchen and laundry room floors. I installed it two years ago and have since had minimal wear and tear, with no peeling up or cracking. It's performed as well as a product twice the price. I'm planning on keeping it in as long as it's looking good, and would even consider using the same product need it be replaced. You can't beat the price!"
4,The Selfish Crocodile,The Selfish Crocodile by Faustin Charles and Michael Terry is a very funny book. It is how a crocodile won't let anyone in the river except himself. Until one day when something happened to him and he discovered that he needs friends. He finds out the real meaning of friendship and that we can all get a long together.
1,just doesnt cut it.,"this cd is just a let down for me, unoriginal beats, bad sound quality and just overall not a great compilation."
3,Interesting but unpolished,"I found this to be a fair thriller and I did appreciate the spin on the post-apolcalyptic theme (what does happen to the incarcerated when the world ends? Apparently they become homicidal maniacs). However, I could not get away from the feeling this was a first attempt, writer's group type of novel. Many characters were stereotypes and the dialogues were a bit wooden. However, there was enough of a plot and human interest to sustain this reader to the end."
3,Eclectic collection of Jolson numbers of variable quality,"This two CD set contains an eclectic and somewhat erratic collection of 48 Jolson songs from studio recordings, along with radio and film cuts. Quality is variable, with a few tracks fairly good, and most others having some noise or cut beginnings or endings; at least one track, ""About A Quarter To Nine,"" is edited. While I would not rely on this CD for clean cuts of these songs, it is inexpensive, and may be a reasonable addition to a starting Jolson library."
2,very disappointing,"Pedro Aznar did some incredibly great vocal work with Pat Metheny between approx. 1985-95. Great talent with a unique alto tenor voice. He also plays guitar, and returning to Argentina i expected a superior album given his background.However, first, the album suffers from terrible sound engineering, and secondly the percussion was frankly a little bizarre. Pedro's guitar was drowned out, and his voice was not the one that graced the albums from PMG.He can do ALOT better! Sorry to be so critical..............."
5,Definitly Cool and Helpful,"If you're ever looking to review and even learn some new french words, this is definitly a good book.You get too look at different parts of the french speaking world, not just France. You also learn in the process different restaurant names and things like that.I liked this book because the fact that it's completely written in french, and the only english in it is the meanings of different vocabulary words.If you're interested in improving your french, then this is a good book to read. You'll be able to read french faster and easier with this book. Enjoy!!"
4,Different but good.,"I really like the Wayward. Barstow is always good, and U.S. Highball is another good song that provides a slice of life. I can imagine being on the train, travelling to Chicago."
5,"Easy To Read, Lots of Information!","Women, It's Your Turn, is a great guide! It is very easy to read and all the information that we as women, are looking for. The section on osteoporosis is extremely helpful, with tables of all the latest information about prevention and treatment. This is the only guide you will need."
4,To understand this book you have to forget what you know.,"Very interesting. It is good for the people who are tired of realistic, sad romance books. This is for the reader with the great desire for something from different world, applied to our reality. That is not the book about anything that has happened in the real life. Jonathan Carroll reaveals his very potential imaginnation. He can write."
1,Programmer's Nightmare,"I don't have the space to convey just how much production time is continually being lost to this abysmally bad product in our shop of senior developers. I could go on for days. Try a little experiment before buying it: go to the CrystalDecisions website and look at some of the most common errors reported. Basic stuff like INSTALLING the product, getting it ready to package up with an install application, pointing it to a DB through just about any connection technology. And it's all downhill from there. I still don't get why there isn't a better product out there yet."
1,does not work,"Instructions are incoherent. Device does not power on, accept or play music, despite multiple attempts with new batteries. Deserves zero stars, but amazon will not let me put zero stars."
3,Born of a Woman,I like most books by Dr. Spong and this one is very interesting. It is hard to follow when referring to some of the biblical comparisons but close study brings most things together. The book opens your eyes and makes you think which is a good thing.
1,Faith is all encompassing,"Belief and faith in God is a belief in miracles and a belief in a higher power. To believe in a supreme being, but to believe that He could not place a child in Mary's womb seems to be a paradox. The author wants people to believe that the Bible should be interpreted differently because of the times we live in. I submit that we should change the times we live in to fit the ideals that God has set for us."
2,Not worth the paper,Poorly organized.Poor references.Sketchy information on real Access development.(This book may be OK for a complete novice who wants to read the tome from cover to cover as an instructional manual.)
2,Another Let Down....,"I find it amazing that someone can dedicate an entire chapter to making forms look pretty, but leaves a mere 4 pages for a barely comprehensible discussion of DAP and ASP. The Microsoft Press is better."
5,Great Book - Want More,"Great book! How can I add anything to that? Best thing is that I can read it again and again but I need more. Yo! Mr. Haley, we need another book real soon. I have worn this one out reading it for the tenth time. Talking with a friend in LA and the rumor is that the big boys have been looking this over for either a movie or TV sitcom. Hope both are true! More rumors are that you have at least six more books coming out. When will they be here? Please hurry! Harry O"
4,The scent grows on ya,"When my boyfriend and i very first sprayed the cologne, we found it to be a bit....strong. But luckly, it mellows out, and becomes quite nice after it gets some air. Its a very woodsy scent, and enjoyable in small doses. It is also a very mature smell, just sayin."
4,Satisfied,Everything ok except maybe the screen protector that is a simple plastic film that does not have the dimensions of the screen of my camera !
4,"nice lights, but they dont last too long","work well. not as bright as the silver star. and with the new daytime running lights, they seem to burn out quite frequently."
1,Didn't work with our doorbell.,"This item is identical to Heath Zenith Wireless Plug-In Door Chime Extender, White #SL-6157-D. I ordered the Zenith and it didn't work. A manufacture tech support individual walked me through set-up, but ended up saying that I would not work with our doorbell. He suggested replacing the existing doorbell! The Zenith wireless extender was returned w/o difficulty and I ordered the Ace hardware model, only to find it exactly identical the the returned item, only packaging was different. Ace hardware accepted the return (minus shipping and a restock fee).These extenders do not work with all chimes."
1,Poor Quality,I expected 10 pcs and only received 6. The material is paper thin. The comforter is as thin as the sheer curtains. I had to send it back.
2,not what I expected at all,"it says 10 pcs. but all you get is: 1 comforter, 2 shams, 1 bed skirt, 2 curtain panels. But, they count the certain set as the rest. It does not look anything like what it describes and it definately doesnt look like the picture. Its thin and I wouldnt have paid the money for it if I'd known all this before. If anyone else wants this, Please go to a department store or purchase anything else."
4,Best album,"For me this is their best album.The musicianship and songs are first class.It's a pity that the same can't be said for the vocalist,who I think was their only barrier to greatness.The lead vocalist can make or break a band.You only have to look at the harm that Blaze Bayley did to Iron Maiden's fortunes,as compared to the boost given to Kamelot's fortunes by the awesome voice of Khan.If you can overlook the sub par vocals,this is still an album worth buying."
3,Not weather proof,"It was not clear in the description that this transformer is not weatherproof. Our HOA used 2 of them for our landscape lighting, but we had to enclose them in a weatherproof box."
4,A Disturbed Young Woman Struggles To Find Herself,"This is a first person account of three years in the life of an emotionally disturbed young woman. The author, Denise Ranaghan, describes her experiences in the US Army with humor and seriousness and above all with directness and honesty. In the same manner, she describes her childhood and abusive parents. I couldn't put the book down. It has the force of real life revealed frankly and movingly."
4,I would recomend it to someone really desperate.,"Not scarey, but cool. A four year old wouldn't be scared of this book."
1,This is definetly the worst of The Goosebumps Series.,"I do not advise anyone to buy this book and/or read it. It is the most boring book I have ever read.R.L.Stine is a Great author ,but this is his Worst story of them all. I do reccommend ""Werewolf of Fever Swamp"". It will Keep You on the edge of your seat through the whole book."
4,Top not if not a little small,First of all the speed of arrival was excellent as was the condition of the product. The main problem I had was that ring spikes require a larger ring size and I didn't know it at the time so I have to wear it on another finger
5,Informitive,this is a great book for info on the Jersey Devil it has pictures and drawings and even maps. Stories of people that saw it and theroys as to how he was born and were he is know. If you are interested in the Jersey Devil then read this book.
3,Was this an oops?,"Don't know who to blame for this. The one we ordered is the one pictured, however we got a dark brown one which we are returning. So whoever goofed, please don't charge my account.."
1,Table of Contents is Best Part of Book,"From the table of contents, you'd think this is the best book about futures you could get. ""Traders Notes""? Too bad, no real insights from real traders. Can you read this book and understand the importance of calculating different hedges; why a speculator should care what hedges are common for different contracts (so one can interpret the news); how to interpret contango for different contracts? This is a large book (well over 600 pages) that looks like it was written simply by collecting introductory articles from a number of sources."
3,Disappointing,"For $30 I expected more. I expected a highly detailed very academic book with tons of pictures. Instead I got a tiny little thin book with huge type that seems to be geared toward an audience that is about 12 years old. This book would lend itself well to being read out-loud to a group of 6th graders.Ms. Scott does include some interesting details and a great bibliography but this is not the finely tuned, dense academic work I'd been expecting.If your looking for a 'nice' fluffy intro book to medieval dress this book might fit the bill. If you're looking for a real resource for medieval recreation.. keep looking."
4,One of the Best,"I received Rio yesterday and finished reading it last night. I've read many comics, mostly westerns, from the 50s, 60s, 70s and even up into the 80s and Rio is definately one of the very best. The story lines are excellent, each flowing seanlessly into the next. Rio is both an interesting and believeable character. The artwork varies from absolutely excellent to good to mediocre. Overall I would highly recommend this book to anyone who likes comics but especially those who appreciate westerns."
4,excellent desk reference,"This book was obviously written by scientists actually working in the field and allows the reader to gain from the writers' actual experiences in development, application and trouble-shooting of various assays. This book will serve as an excellent teaching tool for lab managers to train their staff in the complexity of developing, optimizing and using immunoassays."
4,The music holds up under the strain of the lyrics...,"It's the lyrics that usually sells Lords of Acid, outrageous and heavily inbued with sex, drugs and rock n roll. It's the reason I bought it, and it's the reason my friends did also. But, ""Lust"", holds up and preseveres where their other CD's have failed, due to the strength of the music. Beyond the repeatative message of naughtiness, there's actually memorable techno music, that's unfortunately overshadowed. And it's the music that keeps this CD from just being a novelty to store in the back of my collection."
1,combat vest,"this vest is crap. it looks like it is filled with soft, comftorable material, well its not. its pretty much a bunch of pieces of cardboard where every time you move, they crack in half. this is the most uncomfortbaly vest i have ever worn. you cant even bend over in it without getting stabbed by breaking cardboard. and, you still feel like the whole blow of a paintball. its just like wearing a thin cardboard box and getting shot by a paintball. i would not recommend you get this."
2,"Big, cracked, and very blue","I like these earrings in the picture much better than I do in real life. I love the color in the pic. But when they arrived, they were VERY blue. Not that that's bad, but it's just not what I expected. I wanted the earrings in the picture. They're also much larger than they are in the picture and one of them has a crack across the stone. It's not really noticeable, but it's there and I'm able to see it."
4,Cool lights,"I had a small deck built on one side of my backyard (10.5'x15') to place a conversation set on and maybe a couple of chairs. I purchased these lights and had the builder install them around the two sides that are visible. They are really nice and work with a remote control. They are bright, but not to bright :)"
1,different from what i expected,"the product is different from what i am expecting.i ordered a pair of wiper for my honda civic and i input all the data of my car they need to verify if it fits,and yes it is.but when i received the wiper refill,the width is smaller compare to the existing blade.so,it is loose when you install it and makes lots of streak on your windshield when using it.dont buy this refill,its a waste of time and money.i'm just gonna buy a complete set of wiper blade."
2,Graphics are TERRIBLE for PS2!!!,"Graphics are Actually GREAT, on the back of the CD case. Butthe acutal game has pitiful graphics, PS2 is cable of way better!!!When I first got this game I thought I had a defected game, I noticedright away the movies in the beggining had cruddy graphics (lookedlike the compression rate was way to high) and when you start to playthe player is really blocky (the stair step effect) the trees looklike .., well lets not even say. The game only has 3 coarses!!! Nowif those 3 coarses were highly detailed I could understand, but when aDVD can fit like 4 Gigs of info on them and they put only 3 [cruddy]couses on them that is just stupid. Another dumb thing is the userinterface is [cruddy], I spent about 10 min reading the stupid manualtrying to figure out how to hit, then another 10 trying to figure outhow to play 2 player. The game play is not bad but I can't stand agame that has only 3 cruddy coarses..."
2,Not up to PS2 standards,"After thoroughly enjoying some of EA's other sport titles, Tiger Woods golf left me completely unimpressed and disappointed.The well-captured motion of Tiger is the only plus in this game, as the other features of the game remained below par:- graphics of the courses did not fully utilize PS2 capabilities and are easily beaten by the PS1 version from last year- accuracy of play in terms of predictable distance and ballflight is lacking, even though the analog stick seems to give more control- variety of courses is unacceptable for a PS2 title- overall playability in terms of time to play a round of golf and enjoyment derived from it is rather poor (you spend more time waiting for something to load than play and don't really get rewarded for your wait).In summary, this title seems to have been rushed by EA to get something on the market, so it can go back to the store and I'll just pop in my PS1 PGA Tour Golf for some enjoyable play."
1,Too religious,"I was a fan until this book. Expecting more humor, I paid for this and started reading what amounted to excerpts from previous books. Then, he started with his testimonials as to his faith and I lost it. If you are strongly religious, you may really like this. I'm not, and didn't even get half-way before giving it to my wife. So be warned: he is not a great writer anyway but I really enjoyed his previous books for their funny anecdotes. This one lacks humor. Forget it."
2,Flimsy and not good design,"This lamp is very light weight and not well proportioned. The legs are too ""skinny"" and the glass shelf is too high. If the lamp is placed next to a chair, you have to reach up to place a drink or anything else on it. The shade was dented in on one side, so we have to turn it so the dent isn't visible. It isn't worth the money!"
4,rebecca's empire,"coming home and when it happens are the best tracks, great sound and artist from 99."
1,dissatisfied,"I had problems with this product because I get in bad condition, I requested the change but I got too bad. But the Amazon store interested behaved and timely response to my request, which was satisfied with his answer for this reason I will continue buying from Amazon."
3,ok,"Secrets of the heart is the love story of Amanada and Drew. The couple was married at a young age, when Drew married her because of her abusive father, but Amanada quickly left Drew and striked out on her own because she didn't want to be married out of pity. But years later they get back together. It was a ok read."
1,Doesn't work,I was very excited at first when I read the other reviews that this product was going to reduce/stop the over excess sweating problems that I encounter. I followed the directions and applied this product at night time. I noticed more sweating so I stopped using it. I used it for about two weeks. Guess researches are still in search for a solution to over excess sweating. To all my peer I say let's hope for a better solution.
4,Shifting atmospheres of post-rock,Long drones and creative feedback... washes of experimental post-rock. Liking it.Long drones and creative feedback... washes of experimental post-rock. Liking it.
2,Not good.,"Yes, I am a fan of Skinny puppy and even Ohgr's solo stuff....But Ritalin sucks. This is by far a massive dissapointment from the Puppy clan."
2,What a letdown!,"I picked up this book for two reasons. First, the main character, Cyn, was in the advertising business. Second, I thought the premise sounded interesting. Cyn takes over another women's identity, who has wronged her in the past. I was pretty disappointed on both fronts. The whole advertising business aspect wasn't very realistic, even for a chick-lit book. As far as the plotline goes, the author tried way too hard to make Cyn likable. I ended up hating her because she was so gosh darn nice. The whole identity-stealing sounded great, but came out pretty lame as well. A below par fluffy read."
4,"Smart, funny, and clever, and guess what...it doesn't insult the audience","I first saw Southern Belles at a film festival and I really really liked it. Then when I saw it was coming out on DVD, I had to have it. Fresh and new writer/director team, and I mean, oh what a cast! All up and coming future stars. See them now, before Hollywood sinks it's teeth in!"
5,OFF THE ROCKERS!!!,"I love everything about this project, right down to the cd cover! It reminds me of how I used to dress for school. Anyway, Tye is back in a new form. He totally morphed for this project. It is absolutely phenomenal! I think my fave track is #4. I've only heard about it, but this must be the song that they perform the ""riverdance"" to...in CLOGS! This track speaks so beautifully about the character of God. It is worship in the truest sense. It sends me IN!!! What a refreshing! The whole CD is awesome! I love every track! Thank God for Tye Tribbett and G.A.! Their anointing has gone from greater to glory!"
5,Victory,"I think this cd is great. I love Tye already and this cd made me love him even more I can't wait to see the DVD of the live show. My favorite song is ""No other Choice"" I just think it is a simple song with a strong message. I can't wait to see him in Hampton again this summer. Tye keep up the slammin work."
3,Expected more.,"When I saw the new album out I was excited based on the first release. After listening to it I wasn't all that pleased. I am pretty sure it is a good album to some, but after Tye Tribbett first album I had high expectations. This album is not as good as his first one."
2,Victory??? More like a Disaster!!!,"Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it! Do not buy this CD! You will be very disappointed. I was on such a high from Tye's first CD that I immediatley reserved my copy of Victory after hearing his title track. Thinking that Tye was going to keep the talent coming to the table I was disappointed when I put the CD in my car. There are only 2 or 3 good songs, and worst of all, he puts the best song towards the end. So I had to torture myself until it got to the good stuff. I agree with the other review that suggested ""Look Up"" should be a full song instead of a snippet. To this day, I only pop the CD in to hear ""Victory"" or the song that features Kim Burrell. Other than that, the CD is a disaster!"
2,CD Was Not As Expected,"Tye Tribbett Victory Live album comes up short in my opinion. The last album was spectacular. But Victory live was not compose properly, the music did not flow right, the choir was off. It was more of look how skillfull our musicians are. I only like two-1/2 songs of the entire album. Track 2, 11, and 16. I like 16 because I saw the video. If I did not see the video, the would be a disappointment. Tye, I know you are trying to do something different but the lyrics was not uplifting to me. I felt I would have wrote those lyrics. We need to write music that are not some cliche'.Other than that keep up the good work."
1,impossible to understand,"I just wanted to read something in English, so last summer I decided to buy this book. What a mistake! For me, poor Italian reader, was impossible to understand: There were too many invented words without a meaning. Nevertheless I read it through, but I did not like it at all. I would like to ask the author if he intends to make it translated in Italian so maybe I could understand something more..."
2,Tired,"I grew up on the earlier editions of this book. But now it's well past its prime, very old fashioned. The financial world has moved on at lot in recent years. Due to the influx of serious scientists PDEs are increasingly used in practice, and there's very little of this subject in the book. It's still used in univs but less by serious quants."
5,The Samuelson of Finance,"There is a reason that this text has been in print for so many years - in my view it is the Samuelson of the financial world because there is no other work that presents such a cogent as well as comprehensive introduction to the mechanics of derivatives securities. As a person involved in dealing with these monsters on a daily basis, Hull lives on my desk and has been a constant source of reference. It is also widely used by others in the industry. If Wiener Processes and Ito's Lemma are part of your life, this book is the one to get! PS...the solutions manual is a very useful companion if you want to get full value out of the book, but I have always thought it unfair of textbook publishers to print separate solutions texts when the main work is so expensive in the first place. Is it so hard or costly to tack on 50 extra pages, or it the old story of the monopolist extracting his due?"
4,Works great.,"This is a great little tool: It does what it's supposed to. Works great with the Kreg KHC-PREMIUM Face Clamp.It would be even better with a tip for drilling a pilot hole. I don't understand how to drill pilot holes after drilling the pocket without an 8"" long bit, and even then the angle wouldn't be right. It seems that this should have a tip for drilling the pocket and pilot hole all in one."
3,Not just comedy,"Warning! This is not the Blue Collar Comedy Tour with Vince Vaughn. It's not setup like a comedy show, it's done like a documentary. If your expecting an hour and a half of stand up then you'll be disappointed. However, if you like documentaries and are interested in a more ""behind the scenes"" look at this type of tour and what really makes these guys tick then you will definitely enjoy this dvd. It follows the comedians as they visit 30 cities, in 30 days, doing 30 shows. It gives you a glimpse into their personal lives. How they got where they are now, and what life is really like on the road. Some interesting points are: -Peter Billingsly, Ralphie from ""A Christmas Story"" all grown up. -How the comics and the handled Hurrican Katrina and Rita (takes place in fall of 2005) -How much of a complete mess Vince Vaughn is... lol Definitely worth watching if you're really into comedy."
1,a dreadful vanity project,"This is a vanity project for vince vaughan .The comics are very average .It's a dull, dull, film"
3,"3-1/2 stars, not a bad little horror","This actually was better than I expected. Had an interesting story line and of course any horror movie with Dee Wallace Stone has to be good. If you watch the special features, this film was made in an actual claimed to be haunted, abandoned hospital. Looked it up on the web and found this building used to be a mental hospital and was shut down after one of the doctors killed some of his patients. HMM, creepy!"
2,Ok workout if you're not used to working out,"I was hoping this would provide an alternative to the aerobic-dance-kick workout DVDs that end up twisting my knees. The Walk series is probably ok if you're not used to working out, but it doesn't get my heart pumping. I have to modify it as a running in place work out to get much from it."
4,Love it!,I bought this after using cocoa belly butter for my first pregnancy and love it so far this time around (second baby). It feels great on my skin and haven't had any issues with itching so far. I didn't think I would like the smell after opening the bottle but once you put it on it smells amazing. I love it and I am excited that I found it this time around.
2,Windows 7 for dummies....or anyone else who has never used Windows,"I was disappointed in this book. I have been on Widows since we moved over from DOS. This book seems to be for someone who is no where near that relm.I see features of W7 on advertisements on TV that I can't figure out even though I've been on W7 since Vista Beta. I still can't figure it out, and I can't find it in this book. They didn't design W7 for me...or maybe they did but just can't communicate how I can find what I want.I thought that this would be about the new features that Windows 7 would bring to the table. Guess not.It seems to be all about the functionality of Windows in general. That's not what I wanted. I know how to create a folder.Maybe I misunderstood the intent of the book. I've been in IT for over 20 years and am not new to upgrades.It's really not working for me. I'll try the DVD, but I'm not hopeful.Frank"
2,"Too simplistic - then again, it is for dummies","This book is written for the person with very little computer experience. I just got a new computer with Windows 7 on it, so I was looking for essentially some sort of user manual that will tell me everything Windows 7 can do. However, most everything in this book is extremely basic that anyone with the most rudimentary computer knowledge will already know (ie: folders are used for organizing your information). Very little in here is actually specific to Windows 7, but more of a generalized overview of any Windows system, including XP and Vista.If you have no knowledge of how computers work to the point that you're scared to touch one, yeah, this book might be right for you."
2,Windows 7 for Dummies Rates - Fair!,"Unfortunately, this book, like so many software ""help"" books and newspaper articles is only helpful to a degree. One glaring mistake I noticed was when I attempted to follow the instructions for checking an icon I wanted to ""erase."" I started through the directions, but at the second or third step, the pull-down menu DID NOT have the items listed in the book's directions.I have found this to be true in other books, and maybe it's the result of software changing so quickly that the books simply cannot keep up.I should have known this might be the case, but I have finally determined that the best way to find solutions for software problems is to simply Google for the answer."
3,Windows 7 for dummies & DVD,"As far I have read the book it has several examples and good explanations of certain features of the new OS Windows 7 but for me, what I'm looking for is not crearly explained. However book is good and think I can get more from it. Good Purchase."
3,Sort of helpful; reassuring,"Ok, I guess. But I wish I could get to Microsoft to ask questions. For a company that says it's doing everything to make its products easy to use, you'd think they'd have a help desk."
5,Unlike anything you've ever heard!,"Saul William's mastery of lyric shines in his debut. HIs rhymes aren't trite like 90% of all artists out there today. He rhymes about philosophical issues, laced with metaphoric dreams. He possesses a large following which surely will grow after this release. The music is unlike anything out there, with a blends of hip-hop, jazz, and rock. His band consists of, drums, bass, cello, viola, guitars, and backup singers. A definite MUST HAVE for anyone who considers themselved true hip-hop fans. Expand your mind and deepen your heart."
4,It is what I was looking for,"I have only read the first 3 or 4 chapters in the book thus far, and I would say that it was what I was looking for. I didn't have any kind of background in operating a lathe, and this book is helping me with learning a little more about topic.I appreciate that the book stresses safety and how to safely operate the machinery. Too many people get hurt on machinery because they do not know how to safely run machinery."
3,Good Electronic gaget BUT Impossible to connect to a PC,"I had the MC3 for over 2 months and still not able to use it as it does not work with windows ME . With Windows 98 worked fine. With windows me I tried all possible combinations, and still not able to connect. I contacted Kodak for several times during the last 2 months and they seem they do not know how to solve this problem, All repies from Kodak are ""THIS IS AN AUTOMATED REPLY "" kindly wait !!!!! 2 months"
1,Forget about this one!,"The commercials for this thing made it look so easy and so much fun to use. After looking at it and slavering at it and thinking of the fun I'd have with it, I finally broke down and bought it. To paraphrase Arnie ""BIG MISTAKE!"" Tried to install it on my system but the software included wouldn't talk to the MC3-no matter how hard I tried. Further, the software installed made my system unstable-reset itself many times. I'm returning this piece of trash at the earliest opportunity."
3,Main weakness,Yes....it has very goood quality in playing mp3....but the most depressing thing is ....no flash.....which is no use at night and indoor......! Well....u can't expect much for a toy...!
2,On my way to return it....,"I just bought this camera, for a fantastic price...(...) and I am returning it.1. The battery door is too weak, and will break with in a week or two.2. The pic card door is SOOO weak, when you slightly touch it with pictures on it, it will need a refortmat and you will lose all info on card.3. So unbeleivably dark that wont take indoors pictures even with florescent and halogen bulbs.4. NO FLASH5. Wont work with my windows ME pc.which is top of the line.6. Ive seen Fischer Price Toy Cameras that work better.I owned this camera for less then two hours before returning it. You can say I didnt give it a chance, I can say I didnt give it a chance to aggravate me as much as it has potential to do.If you don't have ME, and can get it for (price) go ahead, maybe for jsut music its great."
3,Too many gimmicks,"This book is acceptable if you are not familiar with the format of the test, but it is not perfect. I found that it had too many gimmicks or tricks that won't really help, but might make you feel like you know some secret. Some of these tricks would harm my test taking style more than help. The writing tries to be casual, but often feels patronizing instead. This book includes two tests and the CD has more, which is a good total. But you'd be better off getting a book of many tests to practice with and a superior book (like Nova's Master the LSAT) to learn the format."
5,A Great Book!!!,"This book is great. I never even felt like taking a break from it, like I do with most books. If you like this book, Read ""The Snowman"" by the same author."
4,I like Grappelli and your violin,"I had a lot of pleasure in hearing Grappelli again, he was the largest violinist of the Jazz, he played with Baden Powell, that is Brazilian, like me (sorry my english) ."
3,I havent been home to even open the box yet,I have not used this yet as I have been gone most the winterI plan on having a good time with it when I do use it
3,hmmmm,This seemed like an awesome way to cook yummy food. However the clean up on this oven is a nightmare. It is not non-stick. The drippings are like concrete to remove. The wings were good but the clean was not worth it! I will sell this at a yard sale this summer!
5,fun to use,This appliance has simplified my meal preperation and makes the food delicious. I would highly recommend it as it is so easy to use and to clean up.
1,Sony's worst product yet!,"The Sony CFDS26 is the poorest quality Sony product I have ever purchased. The CD player worked great for about 6 months, then failed consistantly after playing a few songs. Cleaning, different CDs, resulted in a mixed pattern of music failure."
5,i dont know about you .. but i love this book,This book is good for the beginner who want to study the history of Christianity. the author does not have the bias view at all. simply talk about in historical context.
4,Not bad for a text book,"Interesting, good pace, covers a huge amount of material. Of course, it's 2200 years worth of history so it's not that in-depth and it has its boring parts, but all in all it's not bad for what's practically a text book without pictures."
4,Go Deep On This One...,"You know: I read Amazon's review and cannot help but think how shallow and stupid the person was behind that. This album is a window into the life of a sick individual. The story that is told via the lyrics and the supporting music was done very well. No, this isn't Motley Crew as I'm assuming the reviewer expected it to be. Instead, it's a theatrical tale that covers the pitiful life of an addict. Give it a try and open up your mind, I think you'll like it!!!"
2,Maybe a few more listens will help,"First..LOVE THE BOOK!! Bought it and the cd the first day available.I was hoping the cd would be Nikki reading from the book.Those clips are great.But so far, I just dont like the cd.And its not because its not like Motley Crue.Its the singers voice.To me..just bland and very generic rock over dramatic singing.Lots of breathing..reminds me of Trey and Matt of South Park when they sing metal. To each thier own. I will give it a few more spins."
5,Sixx A.M. Rocks this one too,"---No long review here. Awesome music, awesome lyrics - out of this world CD. Pick it up today and you will be glad you did!"
4,Good rock album,"Good rock album from one of rock music's greats. Would definitely suggest the whole album if you like ""Life is Beautiful"""
5,Sixx is god,I am a huge Motley Crue fan. And when i got this i was not expecting the crue. But i was not expecting the album to be this good. This is one of the best albums i have heard in a long time. This band knows how to play great rock n roll. If you like Nikki Sixx then you must buy this Album. Mr Sixx still can write some great lyrics and music. I really like this album. Go and buy Sixx A.M.it rocks!!!!!!
1,old reviewer,"First I want to say is that I love the Inspector Morse series and I also like the Inspector Lewis series, but not the prices.Spending $450 for 33 shows of about 90 minutes each is a crime and who the hell wants a stupid wooden box to put then in. Where in the hell would you store the damn thing.I do not agree with a lot of the people who think Morse is the best show ever on TV, it is a very good show but it is not the best. There are many just as good and some even better."
4,Good Movie.,"This is a good movie. I enjoyed watching it. If you are a horror fan, as I am, you should watch this."
2,Not Worth The Time It Takes To Watch It,Christian Slater must have really needed the money. This film is really bad. Would not watch it again if it were free.
2,Plot???,"Good thing this movie was free because it definitely isn't worth paying money for. The plot makes no sense, the acting sucks, and Christian Slater must have owed someone a favor or lost a bet to be seen in this flick. The only reason I'm giving it two stars is because I actually watched it all the way through... unfortunately."
1,Actors must be writing good reviews for this,First off . When I rented this movie I saw it was 9.99 and then saw the ratings and said ok im in the mood for a good movie I will spring for the 9.99Soon as I clicked play is when things started to go bad. Movie felt it had the plot written by a 9 year old .All the other ratings on amazon for this movie I am convinced are from the actors themselfs.DO NOT WASTE 9.99 on this!
1,Terrible pacing and plot,"Premise could have been cool, but the execution was plodding and aimless.You know what's going to happen after the first 5 minutes of the movie.The death scenes are ho-hum, and there is no suspense to speak of.The only time I found myself scared was when I realized that there was still another 45 minutes of blah left of this movie.See V/H/S or The Cabin in the Woods instead."
2,prudish old book showing its age,"Up to page 200, there is still some suspense on whether this will be a book about a ""Roman of the Romans"" or simply yet another Quo Vadis remake. Unfortunately, it is the latter:The author resources to the trite narrative trick of presenting the early Christians first as eccentric, and ending up being seduced by them.The narrative is for the most part fluid, but the character development flat and unconvincing.There seems to be an intention of parading as many historical characters of the period in question as possible through personal acquaintance with the protagonist, but that, instead of adding historical interest, strains the plot verisimilitude."
2,Lame,This DVD is lame. I've been to Gatherings and this DVD doesn't show half of the action. I was very disappointed to say the least.
1,"Lords of Acid fans, SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!","Without a doubt, this is the most horrid spin-off from LOA that I have ever heard! While Praga Khan is definitely instrumental in his role in LOA, this CD is a combination of the '90's synthesized sounds with 'classic' '80's metal... PLEASE don't even ask about his vocals!!! If you're wondering why this CD was released in September of 1997 and you still haven't heard tracks from it yet, wonder no more. Save your money and buy something else with a little more polish and ingenuity."
3,Seemed not well put together,I bought this dvd to try a different person in excercise. While it did make me work up a sweat it seemed like it was a disjointed workout. What I mean by that is there seemed to be no clean transition from one movement to the next. Especially when he tells you that for 2 minutes you can do whatever. I am one that needs structure and routine. Overall I just had a real hard time keeping up with it so I stopped using it after a couple of times.
1,Ball bag,I have no idea how you are supposed to carry this thing. Where is the shoulder strap? Extremely disappointed with this product.
5,WOW I read this one cover to cover in one sitting!,"I couldn't put this book down. Ms. Wayne always tells a good story and her men are scrumptious.I'm getting an extra copy for my sister in law for Christmas.When's the next one, Ms. Wayne?"
4,Finally-The reality of the Event,This is an excellent and true account of the events as we can determine. An excellent read. It presents the facts of that fateful night and sheds light on the myths.
5,"No TITANIC library is complete without ""Last True Story"".","Clary minces no words, nothing was off-limits. His research challanged every previously documented fact. Not afraid to ask questions, Clary accepts nothing but the truth as only thorough research uncovers. A welcome addition to the libraries of every rivet counter around the world. Clary leaves the reader asking ""Why didn't I think of that?"""
2,Not so fancy cakes,"The most beautiful cakes were the accessible through the ""look inside"" tool from Amazon store. But the author was very creative and use different materials to cake decorate, not only icing."
5,Dvorak - the best composer of century...,"I always admired Dvorak, and now... This album is a gem. Even if you are not Dvorak's fan, you'll enjoy it. I like Romantic pieces, Sonatina, Mazurek - in fäct, teh whole Cd. Performance - the best, which I can imagine."
1,Believing in others,I think the purpose of the book is to illustrate that if we trust each other and we discuss our diferences we generate synergy and cohesion in any group making it easier for its memeber to achieve a given goal.
3,nice bits,I've only used the 3/4 bit extensively and it chipped soon after initial use. i can't be certain if it's something i did or a defect but take it for what it is.
4,"Nice, but rattle, rattle, rattle, ...","I bought this gate to contain my Standard Poodle in the back of my 2012 Honda Pilot. It does that. The way the rear seats slant when they are flattened keeps the legs of the gate from being super sturdy. I didn't want to over tighten the bolt and dig into the ceiling, so I used a cable tie to attach the gate to the head rest post to keep it from falling on the dog if it wiggles loose. Other reviews said it was hard to put together. I would say it was middle of the road for me- not super easy but I got it done in less than an hour. Now let's talk about the rattling. For this nice quality gate, you'd think they could line the inside of the upper posts where the bottom slides into them and then rattles around. Rubber, silicone, I don't know. I think I'll be taking the thing apart and stuffing cotton balls in there. Did I mention it rattles?"
2,So so gate for my ford escape,Yes it does the job but I will probably could have bought something better. The plastic suction cup are not great at all.
2,Falls short of living up to it's title,"This book falls short of living up to it's Title, and maintaining the level of quality we appreciated in Mrs. Corbin's first work on the subject. ""Curse of the Dutchman's Gold"", and was not well received by her Peers, Superiors and Sources of Information on the subject material.A modest amount of research on the Internet...discloses a considerable amount of discontention among Lost Dutchman Enthusiasts concerning her Moral Right to publish some of the material she presented in this book.Mrs. Corbin takes full advantage of the ""Author's Prerogative"" in her very subjective presentation of what she refers to as ""Facts"" and ""Evidence"". An unusual amount of errors, omissions and fragmented information indicates the lack of ""Quality"" Editing and Review.Poorly Edited, Casually Reviewed and Way Over-Priced."
3,Light is your friend...,"The only reason I got this little gadget was it's ability to do motion captures at 20fps. Unfortunately, it really only works in well-lit areas, even though the audio capture is surprisingly good. MP3 works well and image capture is mediocre to bad. But for all these features at under [money], it's actually quite a bargain."
4,Variance compponents Book,"This is an easy to read book on a complex subject. It is a must for those doing research related to variance components. In particular, I like the way the author developed the topic. In particular the exposition of variance components' development as a subject over time from the early days (in the 1800)to date. This helped me in understanding the subject."
1,Key broke off 1st try so I had to break in with screw driver,"Placed some items in this to try it out and when I went to open it the key broke off. Fortunately, it only took a second for me to break it open with a screwdriver. Hate to be so harsh about a product but feel strongly that people should have an honest opinion as they can't hold the thing till it arrives. I also like Amazon and hope this company doesn't go down the drain because of misleading reviews.""what did you expect for the price?""A cheap safe but one that might help secure valuables. This might only bring attention to your objects - better to hide them."
2,check the dimensions !!,i wanted this safe for my daughter's room but it is way too small. her wallet wouldn't even fit in there..maybe just an ipod and credit cards. Returning for something a little larger
2,not what i was expecting,I was looking for a lock box in a certain size for the objects going in it. It said it was so by so but in reality the locking mechanism made it smaller inside and did not fit what I needed it for. Plus those kind of locking mechanisms aren't very good.
3,"Sleek, unobtrusive and sturdy little safe!","I liked this little safe a lot and the recipient of this gift seemed fairly pleased. I wish I could say he raved about it later, but I never heard anything else about it. Never-the-less, I wish someone would buy one for me. It's neat!"
3,Urban Justice?,"I've played SWAT 3 TGOTY....seems ok, where you can control 2 elements of 5 man team...... the thing that is lacking is the deployment of sniper teams.... I mean, heck, at least the old game Police Quest : SWAT allows you to choose the part of either sniper or element leader career path.With the option of being a SWAT sniper would be great. That means, you can watch the element move in dynamic or stealth from high grounds.The other options is to have the front man use those riot shield to protect themselves from bullets. Still here are the must for these game to shine:1) delpoyment of snipers (players can take the role of sniper)2) use of riot shield by element3) use of several elements (5 man team x elements)4) more hostage rescue, (ie, terrorist will kill the hostage if they see SWAT breaching etc.)5) underground train, aeroplane or even jungle siege (i know this is not Rainbow six, but heck, wouldn't it be great to have this scenarios?)"
3,Useful memoir,The horror of Animal Farm has nothing on this first-hand account from a socio-cide survivor. Good enough writing to support this story. This was a book group choice and I think it will generate discussion in terms of social/political revolutions occurring now.
5,An incredible story written incredibly well,"I've had a low-level interest in Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge since I saw ""The Killing Fields"" a few years ago. I've read a few things and was basically familiar with the history. However, I had no real appreciation for the brutality the Cambodian people endured for those 4 years until I read this book.As somebody stated in an earlier review, I wondered (at first) how a 5 year old child could remember all of this. As I got further into the story, it occurred to me that no one could ever forget this sort of thing. In addition, Ung gives one of her older brothers credit for filling in some gaps. This book is VERY believable.Ung writes about horrific events in a matter-of-fact style. She occaisionaly changes the point of view of the narration, which can be a bit confusing. But, overall, it's easy to follow the story. It's even easier to become drawn in to the story.I put another book aside to read this. I'm glad I did."
3,QUESTIONABLE/TOUCHING,"Book is slow at first. It gets sort of repetitive like when she describing herself starving, i know it was an important part but it was too much. I also felt like some parts were missing, like when they were running away from the camp, and than all the siblings just happen to find eachother magically...? but anyway it was a good easy read and made me cry in some parts."
1,The bottle is half empty,The chi keratin mist was wasted in the box other wise its ok i love the product what can we do about replacing this bottle
3,It is okay,"This product didn't really do anything for my hair. I looked on the ingredient list and I can't even find keratin on there. Maybe there is another name for it? Usually products with keratin will say ""hydrolyzed keratin"" or ""keratin amino acids"" etc. This does not. Since it really didn't help me, I'm not going to buy it again."
2,Caution: Try before you buy!,"I only have the sample and was surprised by the unusual FONT style - fine lines that taper off with no serifs! I found it difficult to read at any (reasonable) size. I will probably buy it eventually but if you have any visual handicap, I strongly reccomend you sample it first yourself."
3,"I know the description says pads,but....","they are so small! I cannot imagine using them as a hygienic item, I mean come on Tucks, they are the same size as a makeup remover cotton pad. But lesson learned as they say."
1,Absolute Rubbish,"Had this for less than a year. In the first six months it jammed constantly and wouldn't take more than one page of paper without problems. Then the problems really began. Crunching and clicking sounds were followed by it stopping working entirely. The motor still went, but the shredder blades stopped turning. It was taken apart to see what was wrong and it was discovered that almost all the internal cogs are made of plastic. One of these cogs had broken. Parts are not available so the entire shredder had to thrown away. This fault is very common, leading to it appearing to be a deliberate design flaw. In other words these things are designed to crap out.I will never by another Fellowes shredder, they are absolute rubbish."
1,Do not buy.,This is a terrible product. It jams all the time. The use of this equipment is for the occassional (1-2 pages per week) user.
1,From Bad to Worse,"Please learn from my mistake; don't purchase this inexpensive confetti shredder. It struggles with two sheets of paper. It gets hot and stops during use. It no longer wants to shut off. The supplied bin is small and fills up after a few sheets of paper (which doesn't happen too quickly due to the shredder's pathetic abilities). I owned a Fellowes strip shredder for approximately 20 years without incident. It was made in USA. I'm guessing the Chinese manufacturing ""partners"" of Fellowes have a hearty laugh each time they load up the export container full of these truly awful shredders. Shameful, really....."
3,Some time these things are necessary,"I've used pocket holes a bunch over the years for various woodworking projects and every once in a while need to buy a pack of these to hide the holes I can't otherwise hide. I think of them as sort of a necessary evil, they don't fit the holes so well and always require more sanding then I'd like, but in then they work well. These particular Cherry plugs are as good as the others."
1,Junk DVD set.,"I read all the Sharps books and looked forward to this set of DVDs. The set was well priced and delivery came quickly. The problem came when I tryed to view them. 60% of the videos would simply stop somewhere in the show, causing me to go back to menue and fast forward past the ""bad"" spot. Depending on the video they would stop once, twice, three times or more. One was so bad that it could not be viewed at all. In an attempt to solve this problem, I asked my neighbors to come over and try. After some effort they gave up in disgust. We tryed it on the neighbor's player with the same results. I even went out and purchased a new DVD player and met with the same results. The last three in the series played just fine - big deal."
4,Quite a Surprise,I will confess I've avoided this band because of their name. I kind of expected punk ska or or really popy Ska. What I found was a never pleasent Ska band that desires more attention then they have got.
3,OK Game,"Bought this game for my 5yo to play on his DSLite. He rates it OK, but prefers the original Ty the Tasmanian Tiger for Gamecube. he says this game is harder than the original Gamecube version. I got a great deal on the game, so can't complain about the price."
5,Fantastic,"Best tool I have ever had for for cabninet installation, window installation, or general lighter duty needs. I have driven screws in to hardwood stiles with no problems. This driver is so light and compact it allows you to fit in tight spaces that a regular impact driver cannot fit and with the holster you hardly notice it is with you. For constant heavy driving needs I use my 18 volt Mikita. I would say that 80-90 percent of the time the Bosch PS-40 is all that is needed."
2,ok,The book is filled with mathematical formulas and number. A crash course indeed. Not for beginners or to read in a lazy day.I gave it 2 stars instead of 3 because they put 'easy' in the title of the book.
5,excellet,"The performance are great, a lot of ballet, less acting, excellent production, dancers wow, you would never regret to buy this dvd"
4,"Good movie, good messege!",Worth watching. I loved the transition from the first to the second half of the film. Good acting.
3,Where's the Best One??,"Music evokes feelings . . . strong feelings . . . feelings that occur during and long after an event. When Richie Aprile is deservedly blown away we thank Janice for saving the world . . . well, at least HER world. The song played at the end of the episode is Annie Lennox's ""I Saved The World Today"" . . . arguably the best song ever used in a Soprano's episode. It's absence from ""Peppers & Eggs"" is unfortunate. Without it, this can only be a 3-star compilation."
5,ahhhhhhhhh,this cd couldn't have been any better...awesome.makes me want to watch the whole serie all over again...and again...and again...
4,Unconventional use,"I was looking for something to mark our dogs messes with in the backyard since my son was having problems finding them. I had seen the flags outside our house marking the gas line and it dawned on me why not use flags. I got the hot pink ones so they cannot be confused with the water, gas, and other ""official"" flags. They work great! When there is a sea of pink flags in the backyard it's time for my son to go clean 'em up. It goes so much faster & he doesn't complain as much. My neighbor even likes them because she can see where the messes are and knows not to park the car to close to them so her kids won't step in them. I am hoping they will make cleanup in the winter snow easier & faster too. Only problems I have had are they rusted with all the rain and are easy to bend if the ground is too hard. But for the price, amount of flags, & not having to hear my son complain it's to hard & takes to long they are worth the money & I will most likely buy more in the spring."

4,What They Don't Teach You in School,"The author calls this book a ""field manual"" for software developers. It contains a number of strategies for dealing with coworkers and managers, preventing project catastrophies, and in general helping the programmer improve his working environment and smooth out the development process as much as possible. This is a book about self-defense as a programmer and as an employee.The chapters read like essays or lectures. Each contains gems of wisdom, but they are buried in amusing and well-worded but tangential redundancies. If the book had a little less fluff, I wouldn't have nicked a star from my rating.That said, I've just finished a chapter and found a few of the exact sort of strategies I was looking for. The author is both intelligent and pragmatic. Its weaknesses aside, this is precisely the kind of book I've been searching for."
1,The CD version of the book does not work on Windows 3.1.,Excellent hard copy book. But when the CD is loaded it does not work. Repeated telephone coversations and mail for over six weeks yields no positive response. Poor customer relations
3,great idea but needs improvement,"the bib is wonderful, good size, great absorbency, but the neck band gets too stretched out to be of much use with a chin drooler or a slow spit up child. It needs to be a tighter band so it stays more snug under their chin and around their neck, or at least have some type of way to tighten or adjust the neck circumference."
4,A sober and accessible account,"This is a good account of Arab Nationalism from a scholarly perspective, written in accessible language. The author has no axe to grind. Readers might detect an occasional note of wistful sadness, though, as Dawisha contrasts the movement's mid-century promise and fervor with its disappointing outcomes. Dawisha sets himself the task of explaining the movement's shortcomings and weaknesses, and he does a good job of it."
2,not the best book to read,"I had to read this book as a requirement for a class paper, it is by far one of the worst books ive read. It is boring, and dry and long, if you want to read this book for personal enjoyment then you must really have to love this topic or else you will get a headache after 10 pages."
3,Evans stretches,"A ""based on"" story that is enhanced by CE's out of control lawyer. Some insight into how the system breaks down those attempting to do the right thing. Scary drug scene."
2,In need of a good editor!,"Although interesting, and at times rather funny, this book needed a good editor. The writing is repetitive, and several parts of the book could have been cut without any loss to the overall book. In fact, clipping some stuff would have made this book a much better one."
3,"Often funny, but by no means great.","Dan Savage is a smooth and winning writer, but this exploration of his adoption is pretty facile. Savage is frequently glib, and even though this glibness is indeed very funny, it doesn't allow for a lot of thought-provoking material. I also didn't really get a feel for one of the primary players of this story -- Savage's partner Terry. My only impression of Terry is unfavorable -- surely not the picture Savage wanted to present. An easy read, but ultimately a disappointment."
3,Funny and touching true-life story,"A breezy, fun read. Not great, but very enjoyable. It helps if you're already a fan or can handle sarcastic/raunchy humor. The true value of the book is the story itself--an inspirational example of people having a dream and going for it even though they've been told all their lives they can't have it. It doesn't have to be your dream to enjoy it. Don't expect high literary value--that's not the point here. This is real experience, real guts, and real love, written by a smart guy. I'd definitely recommend this to male couples in the early stages of considering adoption, because it's inspiring without being corny. I do have to gripe, however, that the publishers/editors should have been more careful in the printing. There are dozens & dozens of those sloppy, spellcheck-invisible mistakes that litter far too many books these days. Writers deserve more respect! Fix it for the paperback edition!"
4,A great read. . . .,"Dan Savage's book on becoming a parent is a refreshing antidote to all those holier than thou parenting tomes that make having a family sound at best boring, at worst torture. Savage shows that cynical, messy, urbane folks (be they gay or straight) have plenty of love to offer and can be great parents."
1,Test of patience...and I lost.,"I spent 6 hours yesterday trying to get this scanner working. I have a total of 5 photos scanned to show for it. The software that comes w/ it is buggy as hell. I got REPEATED ""hanging application"" errors. I even updated to the most recent drivers/software from Microtek's website. NOTHING fixed it. I was so ready to throw the damn thing out the window you have no idea!! I'm a network administrator and I work on computers day in and day out. I have endless patience for these things but this one tested my limits. After serious digging I've found a couple others that said to ditch their software/driver package entirely and use something else. Either Silverfast ($50) or Vue Scan. I'm willing to try since I'm on a serious timeline here to get some photos scanned. But honestly, pass this item up!! It will only cause you headaches."
1,Big letdown,"I have 99% of Mike's music on cd. I listened to this one 3 times and I can not listen to it any longer. Huge letdown. Looking forward to the new UFO cd Sharks coming out late August - 2002.Again, I love UFO/ Michael Schenker music, but this one was a waste of my money. The singer also absolutely does not fit his band. Save your money and buy any other Schenker cd."
1,Schenker lost in hollywood,"This is without a doubt the worst record of Schenkers career, and that is really saying something my friends.This is the worst sort of vapid 80s glam rock I think I have ever heard. A tuesday night in 1989 at the roxy featuring a bunch of drunk and tatooed girly men would be no worse. Schenker has a knack for finding the worst possible vocalists with the stupidest most banal 'we're gonna rock, yeah, come on, girl, tonight!' lyrics possible. And here he writes crotch brained riffs in Am to match. The worst. Blame it on the medication?This was a major letdown after his two very good and very strong instrumental efforts. Pick up 'adventures of the imagination' and remember what makes Schenker great. Pick up this CD only to throw it in the garbage bin."
4,Great resource in my second grade classroom,"I've used this teacher's guide to supplement a Charlotte's Web unit in my second grade classroom for several years. This guide divides the book into chapter groups and provides vocabulary and comprehension checks for each group of chapters. This has definitely reduced my workload! My students also perform the reader's theater provided in this guide. Having a script already prepared is a real bonus, and performing it is definitely a highlight for most of my students."
2,average applicability to the classroom,"For students who are studying the language and the themes of the book, this guide is not really useful save for some reading questions in the book. otherwise most of the contents are filler for classes."
1,VERY Difficult to install!,"My husband and I tried 3 different times to adhere the window tint to our storm door. We even took the glass out and laid it on the ground. If it wasn't air bubbles that wouldn't come out, it was the edges of the tint that were difficult to trim and ended up jagged, or finally it was air bubbles that made the window tint crease and wrinkle permanently. We gave up after hours and over $60 spent on rolls of tint and application kits. I wouldn't waste your money on this product, we're searching for something else. Maybe a static cling one."
3,Well-written historical novel about Imperial Rome,"This is a rather well-written historical novel about Imperial Rome, specifically the rise and fall of Aurelian, who became emperor at a crisis point during the 3rd century A.D. and was able to restore the empire's fortunes. He was a worshipper of Mithras, ""the unconquered sun"" (hence the title of the book)."
5,Mallory is leaving.............. OH NO!,"Mallory is my fav BSC Member in the whole siries! Will the books be the same without her? Furthermore, Riverbend, the boarding school Mallory attends isn't all it's cracked up to be. Alexis is Mallory's mean roomate, she misses the BSC and her family as well. Can she shake it off and fit in? Personally I'm pretty sad that Mallory is leaving, but I do admit it's a good book. That's why I gave it 5 stars. Great job Ann!"
4,fun and interesting mystery,"Although the characters in this mystery are not particularly sympathetic, the story is original and well told. The main character Cassandra gives us a magnificent tour of Venice - showing parts that most people are unfamiliar with, making one of the most enchanting cities seem even more enchanting. The music history that is expained is equally enthralling. The plot has some twists and turns, and makes for a fun read."
3,An entertaining mystery,"Cassandra Reilly, a book translator, goes to Venice to help her friend Nicky Gibbons (a bassoonist) when she's accused of stealing a priceless bassoon. Each of the other musicians has her or his own secrets, and when one of them is murdered, Cassandra is as baffled as everyone else (including the reader). And what of the mysterious oboe player Anna de Hoog? When she makes the moves on Cassandra, is there something more sinister in mind? Barbara Wilson's mystery is an entertaining story with many bewildering turns. As a reader, I didn't feel for any of the characters here, but rather I was enchanted by the sights of Venice and the fascinating history Nicky and Cassandra explore about Vivaldi and the orphaned girls who became musicians."
1,TOTALLY GROSS!!!,"I bought this October 25, 2011 and I kept it in a cool, dark, and dry place.I went to use it about 3 months later in a soup I was making. And I looked at the still vacuumed sealed container with the wrapper still in place and unbroken and OMG,I notice what looked like to be a ca coon and greenish color maggot ( probably from eating the green vegetables)!!!IMOP, this had to have had happen during the processing because the jar is still sealed. YUCK!!!I called AMAZON C/S and they did credit me. But what if I would have used before the maggots showed in the container?!!! I HATE TO THINK ABOUT IT!!!NEEDLESS TO SAY I WON'T BE BUYING THIS ANY MORE!!! And I'll look for another company to buy dried vegetables for soups.If I could rate this a negative 5, that's is exactly what I would score this!!!TOTALLY GROSS!!!"
1,WOW GOATS COULD MAKE BETTER MUSIC,"Wow this album is without any sense of musical skill. It is taking all their instruments and combining them with strings, that sound well uncreative. I think they might even be synthesized. I mean get real Angra, stop making dull music and try to be somewhat creative, because you arn't."
1,This book will no help anyone!,This books main focus is not to help educators deal with diciplin but to inform them that all young adults need it. It is an unesscessary book for any collection. This book conentrates on permanently hurting the child emotionaly so that then they will not do it ever again. I was disgusted also with the layout of this book
4,WARNING! It needs a Serial port.,"It arrived in good shape, great packaging, and an obsolete Serial connection which my computer doesn't have.If your comp has a serial port, it's a great buy. If you are unsure, have a friend of a high tech level tell you if you can use it on your comp.(I will however say I haven't had a comp with a serial port since 2001) You CAN still use it without the port, but you lose most of its functionality."
3,quality,"very sturdy product but definetly too difficult for even my strong 8 yr old... holding on to them for maybe spring or summer,, due to there quality i think they will be great fun once the kids can get the hang of it."
5,"Very, very good!","It's her debute album and I never heard about her. Saw her name as a recommended artist for me, after having ordered a few CDs by Joan Osborne, Marilyn Manson etc. So I clicked on the link to listen to some Real Audio samples to decide what to do with this recommendation... and I got hooked. Since then this is the single most often listened to CDs I have. It is so great! Her voice reminds me of Tanita Tikaram, Sophie B. Hawkins and a bit Joan Osborne - it's strong with a vibrato; the songs are absolutely the latest of our times, with special sounds in the background. There are two video clips on the CD too. I am so glad that I've found her music!"
5,"Wonerful voice, and lyrics that you can identify with","I discovered Amanda when I was listening to a friends sample cd. It took me a year, but I finally went out and bought the cd, and I was thrilled about every single song on this album. I was particularely moved by the haunting melody and touching lyrics of ""A Child Believes"", and the slightly retro sound of ""Glory Girl"" The songs on this album all have an un-replicateable flavour that I'm sure everyone would love."
2,Major dissapointment,"Amanda ghost conjures up the aura of half a dozen or so female singer songwriters but has no unique voice. ""Idol"" is a great song. Great lyrics. Great arrangements. But the rest of Ghost Stories is uncompelling and boring. It becomes a game of figuring out what Amanda was listening to when she wrote other songs on the record. Stevie Nicks. Kate Bush, Tori Amos, Mary Margaret O'hara, Natalie Merchant whatever.I must be fair. I have listened to the entire record once. That one time was a major test of my patience and nerves. Maybe I have an unfair bias against this album.end kdc"
1,Extremely bad review book. Do not buy ever!,"GRE Chemistry is an astonishingly bad test prep book. There is no discussion of the GRE Chem test in particular, though there is a long-winded, painfully out-of-date section on the GRE General test. The practice test appears to date from a time when test-takers wrote in their answers to the questions by hand. The only study material is some (again, very dated) notes at the end of the book. They are not tailored at all to the GRE, and they are not at the right level. They seem like notes from a high-school or intro college chemistry class.Do anything at all to prep for the GRE, as long as it isn't buying this book. Get something from Kaplan or Princeton Review. Check out textbooks from the library (this worked best for me). Just do not buy this awful, awful excuse for a book."
1,BEWARE - worst transfer on the market,"Ida Lupino's harrowing post-noirish tale is given shoddy treatment in this release, where dark scenes are pixelated even on the smallest of monitors/screens. It ruins the entire film and is a waste of money. Remastered? From what? A copy of a copy of a copy.....this is terrible. Look elsewhere - the film is highly recommended."
1,WARNING,"The DVD version of the film ""The Hitch-Hiker"" offered for sale by the Roan Group does not play on various DVD players. Roan is aware of this problem, but does not advertise it. I have (unfortunately) purchased two copies of this DVD and in each case, the DVD freezes after the first few seconds of the standard introductory warning.The film itself is an important noir by an important actress and director, Ida Lupino. It is well worth seeing, but buying it from the Roan Group will not necessarily give you the opportunity to view it. Buy it from KINO if you want to see it."
2,Slow and uninvolving noir,"The Bottom Line:The Hitch-Hiker may be the only film-noir ever directed by a woman, but it's unfortunately also one of the worst I've seen; exceedingly dull even at a short 78 minutes, with a minimum of tension and a lot of pointless wheels-spinning, this is a disappointing film that has little to offer and should be eschewed in favor of more interesting films like John Sturges's similar but better Jeopardy."
4,"If you enjoyed Tom's radio show, this is a beauty of a read.","If you have ever heard Tom's Radio shows, you will certainly be in touch with this book. He brings back familair stories and charaters that seem to make the ""end of the road"" like any small town we might have ever seen. Even if you havce never heard nor read Tom, one could be charmed by his clever wit and amazing story telling skills."
5,Wonderful human stories!!,"I have read all of Tom Bodett's books, and listened to several of them on tape as well. I feel that this book is his best. Further developing characters he had introduced in previous stories (although knowledge of the previous stories isn't required, it made this story more meaningful for me), Bodett weaves together humorous, touching, emotional, and very personal stories. The chapter where the couple traveling across the country sees the Rocky Mountains for the first time brought me right back to my first trip to the Rockies and the way the mountains overwhelmed me in their mass and presence. I went back and read that chapter three more times before going on!! A wonderful book for reminding us that every person around us has their stories."
2,Dissapointed.....,"I did realize this was for a beginner, but at least show all 4 punches in boxing (jab, cross, hook and uppercut). I could've taught someone what this DVD has to offer in 2 minutes. I want my money back."
2,Sole dependency on this book ensures gauranteed failure.,"Sorry, i have to be harsh. I studied this book inside out and on my first attempt at the exam i find out that this book dosent help in half questions asked in the exam. Had to take the exam again after getting hold of official course material. What is more surprising is that this is from cisco press and still is not on the mark. Mistakes , contradictory statements, shallow introduction to concepts.. overall, this book was written in a hurry. Only the screen shots of the vpn concentrators are helpful. I am not qualified enough to judge the authors, but i can surely say that they have not done their homework right on preparing this book.why 2 stars? because the basic concept are enumerated well and the screen shots are helpful."
3,Reasonably written.,"This book contains a fair amount of information required to pass the exam however there is material covered on the exam, not included in the text. The exam has a ton of questions on the 3002 h/w client and the chapters on this stuff was not clear and some info was left out. For the amount of time they spent explaining the client firewall stuff, there was few questions on the exam. Overall, I found this book a poor representation of what you'll see on the exam. They say in the book that the chapter questions are harder than what you'll see on the exam. This is not the case."
2,Good But not enough.,many mistakes and looks as if made in a hurry. Updates need to be made as far as vpn clients and remote access for vpn 3002 HWC. I found several mistakes on the CD and could potentialy steer you wrong. I would wait for revisions to be made before purchasing this book. Remember there is not alot out there right now as far as the new exams from cisco go and right now this is about it. I also would have liked to see a concentrator simulator but it doesnt supply one. maybe some day.
2,Not enough,This book is a good basic trainer of IPSEC and contains the concentrator information but its not enough to pass the exam. I believe it lacks newer versions of the client and 3002 for remote access. Buyer beware.
2,Wish Amazon sold CURRENT edition of this book!,"I purchased this book as part of a contractors licensing course for classroom instruction. All of the instructors comments regarding this book alluded to page numbers and particular passages of the text. To my utter dismay, I was sold a previous edition of this book and the references were of no use to me. Unfortunately for me (and fortunately for those who are provided with the current edition) is the fact that the CURRENT edition is an extensive re-write. Shame on Amazon for not alluding to the fact that updated editions are available and what I actually purchased is an older edition (under the guise of NEW!).So this review is not so much a criticism of the book but disappointment in Amazons less than satisfactory performance."
4,good information,"I'm a DIY guy, why pay some dummy to do it when this dunny can. From the book I got much need information to finish a project I'm working on.The book is loaded with usefull construction information.It helped me through code requirements without a licensed engineer review.I ordered two books from different sources but only got one."
3,Everything in junky packaging...,"The toolset is complete, solid and comes with a lifetime guarantee. The case that holds them is cheap, flimsy and looks like it'll be broken in a couple uses. I don't understand what manufacturers are doing these days, good tools + crappy case = sub-par product."
5,Only thing that keeps my sanity,"Works well for ""visual"" people. Plenty of room to write, so I can actually understand my handwriting. Important events stand out and the extra yellow spaces allow for notes, lists, etc. I have tried other appt books, this is the best."
3,expensive,"I bought this fan over a year ago and have no real complaints other than the bright LEDs mentioned by the previous reviewer. Why only 3 stars? The steep price. For $100, you can probably buy two tower fans from the competitors that will do the same thing. But the Brookstone fan is much taller than the cheaper ones and it's backed by their lifetime warranty."
5,Shower Breeze A Hit!,"I chose this product for the chrome connection fitting which other products do not have. The hook holds the 3 feet of tubing nicely out of the way and the picks stay put. It took a time or two to get the strength of the spray just right, but when I see my dentist next I am sure he will be impressed. I love being able to use the power of water in the shower where water belongs in my bathroom! Thanks"
4,Shower Breeze really works,"No muss, no fuss. Simple installation. Does the job without making a wet mess all over the bathroom counter like a stand-alone unit. Lever valve allows you to even control the pressure of the stream. This makes oral hygiene much easier. The one thing that you have to think about is the water temperature when you use it...a HOT shower is great, a HOT stream of water in the mouth may not be so great."
3,The messiest appliance in Amazon!,"This thing needs and on/off button, a flow regulator and more flexible tubing. Having to control each of these variables with the tip in your mouth causes pain in temperature sensitive spots, spouts of water striking the bathroom mirror and floods of water dripping off the elbows all over the counter top.It does clean the gum line better than floss."
1,It works but the quality is absolute crap.,The hose is cheap plastic and won't straighten out. It is always tangled. The tips do not lock in the hose tightly. They come loose easily.
1,Better off with the manual,"This book on Authorware, costing significantly more than most, is horrible. I purchased the book since it came so highly rated by other readers and was the only one that covered Version 5.2 at the time. Usually the rating system works very well, but what a fluke it was for this! First of all the publication seems like it was produced out of someone's garage or home office. T.A.A.M comes in a small 3-ring binder with hardstock paper, but the ill-fitting pages extend beyond the binder. It also comes with a companion CD that has a slapped-on label by one of those cheapy home lable kits. After a few weeks, my CD-ROM can no longer read data off the CD either.Worst of all, the content seemed like a huge overview, never really going into detail or sufficient explanations of more difficult concepts. I have gotten more out of the Macromedia's software manual. Do not waste your money, unless it's on your company's dime and you want to build up your reference library =)"
5,really pretty good,i enjoyed this book immensely being an avid civil war buff and all. a great book for those who really love history
5,A Must-Have!,"I knew there was much to see and do in Las Vegas (and surrounding area), but didn't realize how much until I saw this video. We watched both the 2000 (Millennium edition) and the 2001 edition. Both are worth having. There are some similar shots in the two videos, but they each offer different scenes. These videos are a must-have for anyone planning to visit the Las Vegas area. Complete coverage, great shots, pretty detailed info... its all on this video! We would have missed lots of things without this video. And now that we've returned from our trip, we watch again, as its a nice recollection of our trip, and the video captures the essence and beauty of this fascinating city that an ordinary camera can't do. Gambling? Yes, its everywhere in Vegas. But there's so much more, and its all on this video. I strongly recommend this video!"
2,THIS IS DANG HARD AND FRUSTING!!!!!!!!!!!,This game mega hard!!! I hate it! I though it would be fun and cool but it is NOT!!!!!! Warning : if you are not into very very super hard games don't buy this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Battlefront 2 - Not the greatest,I am a huge BF1 fan. Mostly played CIS. Everything about the graphics and physics of the BF1 look great. BUT I can't say that about BF2!! In BF2 the lasers effects look totally weak on the AAT and they don't do as much damage! You have to actually hit a person to kill them instead of just the shear force of one hitting the ground near them like in BF1.The wrist rockets on SBDs don't do as much damage either. They're weak! The physics of the game have been totally compromised when compared to BF1. Things look blurry and detail looks totally different. Things look really squirrelly in BF2 and it's hard for me to follow everything.I love BF2 - it's great - it's just that it has a totally different look and feel when looking at game play movement.The lasers are totally weak and who's the purple idiot with the crappy laser gun?
3,SWB2,"This game is nice. The single player ""Rise of the Empire"" campaign is much better than the ""Galactic Civil War"" and ""Clone Wars"" campaigns from SWB. You actually have objectives. There is a roll button and you can role forward. You can also sprint. The maps were not all as good as those in the original battlefront. Luckily, via Xbox Live, you can download Kashyyk: Assault (for free) and both Rhen Vars, Cloud City, and Yavin 4: Temple. I'd sefinitely get this game. Forgot to say... THE GRAPHICS ARE A-W-S-O-M-E."
5,Awesome...love it!,"This is an awesome game! I've almost beaten it already. Graphics are good, no scratches on the disc, everything works great."
5,Star wars battlefront 2,This is a great tps and and the gameplay is brilliant. The graphics are slightly improved and the changes they have made are brilliant. I think that this game is highly addictive so when you start to play be warned coz you'll never want to stop.
2,Is anybody more impressed with herself than this writer?,"This book reads like Ms. Bright invented not only sex, but pithy observations. My own diary is more insightful than this self-important tome. Do yourself a favor and buy something else."
5,An Embedded Book for Starters and Experienced,I found that this book is well organized and presented. It is the best 8051 book I have encountered. I strongly recommend this book if one needs to understand how to program 8051 in the assembly level (and C level too IMHO).
3,Logan's Running...again,"Though I haven't read this book since it first came out in paperback, nearly 30 years ago, I do remember a bit about it. It comes across as if Nolan wrote it to try and cash in on the interest in the original Logan's Run since it had recently been an Academy Award winning movie and a short lived TV series.The story has a race of aliens plucking Logan from his home and placing him on an alternate Earth to see if he his actions and their consequences were a fluke, or if he can ""free"" another world.More or less a ""what if I had done this instead"" story, Logan's Search was a weak end to the triolgy, but enjoyable for die hard Logan fans."
5,Awesome book,My son really likes this book. He read this book at school and he thinks it is very realistic and well-written!
5,OK,"""Christian Punk is a joke.Ewww.."" ya ok. anyway this review aint about punk posers who dont know what punk is. to people like them we're Dead To The World. ya Officer Negative is the baddest Christian band out there! its about time tha punx stand up for wut they believe in!"
1,Inadequate,"RotoZip bits are available to cut plaster, cement board and ceramic tile among other applications-----don't believe it. My house is 55 years old with walls of lathboard and plaster. I was looking forward to cutting some nice neat lines with the TC1 bit. The tool is hopelessly underpowered for this application, it balks and overheats. The TC1 bit that wouldn't cut plaster snapped when I tried to cut 1/2 inch cement board. I resorted to my angle grinder for both tasks. The only use I found for this tool was cutting receptacle openings in 1/2 inch drywall, a job I can acomplish quicker and neater with a handsaw. Disappointing to say the least."
1,cheaper version of a router,"I bought a this Rotozip from HomeDepot priced at $60 and a special floor tile bit for the purpose of cutting curves on floor tiles. The special floor tile bit was a complete disappointment--see my reviews on X-bit. The Rotozip failed to live-up to my expectation. In tight corners, its greatest attribute is its small size relative to a full size router. However, handling and manuevering the Rotozip is less secure because the Rotozip lacks the two handles found in a full sized router. While this tool is smaller than my full sized Milwaukee router, the powerful Milwaukee operated smoother with less vibration. In terms of feel, the Milwaukee router felt more well-built and balanced. But to be fair, my Milwaukee router is almost $200.00. In summary, this Rotozip is a use-once-a-while tool for a home-owner, not for commerical application."
1,Forget It; Buy a Kit,"Lacked any accessories and what first appeared to be a good deal, wasn't after adding up the costs for accessories that otherwise come in a RotoZip Kit packaged product. I returned this and bought a kit."
2,Not quite there,"The playback of the music on this unit sounds good. It has many problems that outweigh this positive. The worst problem is that it caused my Handspring to lock up quite often causing a soft reset and sometimes a hard reset. It also ate batteries very quickly. I even got a AC adaptor when I was loading the files and a AC adaptor for the car. It still used batteries too quickly.Also, It takes way too long to load mp3 files on onto it. Innogear was offering a speedloader to load the mmc file faster. Minijam uses a propietary format on the mmc card so you can't just buy any mmc card reader.You cannot store any kind of file except for mp3 on the mmc cards either.This is a product that has potential if Innogear will address all of the above problems."
1,Disappointing at best...,"This cd has two good songs...King of Kings and I Walk Alone. Other than that, its pretty bad. By the way, I Walk Alone is the version being used on TV. I am not sure why a few people say it is different.Why is Edge's theme missing? Its a good thing its on the Alter Bridge CD.I am a long-time WWE fan, 20 + years...and this is by far the worst cd they have put out."
3,Just a question,"Why wasn't Kurt Angle's ""Medal"" (extended) or his ECW remix theme put on this album? That would've made this album almost perfect."
2,"Fozzy 'All That Remains Reloaded"" is far better, check it out.","This is ok, but the real hidden WWE gem is the new Fozzy 'All That Remains Reloaded' CD/DVD from Chris Jericho! It is truly an incredible CD, and Jericho is an AWESOME singer! It should be #1 on the charts over the Nickelback type CD's, but I don't really see it advertised much or ever hear about it on their WWE television shows. I have been able to find it everywhere, so I know the stores all have it....just doesn't seem to be that people know it's out there! You have to check out the samples Amazon has for Fozzy...."
3,"Pretty Good, BUT...","I strongly recommend the WWE Anthology album or any of the old WWE cd's over this one simply because of the fact that so many songs on the album are unfamiliar...in some cases...not even remotely attached to a single WWE superstar. Now, from start to finish you DO have some good metal, r&b, and latin hip hop...my fav's are the Batista joint, the RKO joint, the Big Show joint, and the RVD joint, the rest are fillers...and I never thought I'd see the day that 3-6 Mafia would come WACK. The Mark Henry joint is the single most mediocre joint that you could hear from 3-6. Would've been better if they'd thrown in some familiar entrance themes(I mean, did they ever record 'Time to Play The Game' or Kane's current entrance theme?)."
1,WhaT A WASTE OFA CD,"wHY WOULD ANYONE WANT TO BUY WRESTLING THEME SONG NOWADAYS? iT WAS MUCH BETTER OFF WHEN WRESTLERS HAD THEIR OWN MUSIC,NOW SINGES WANT TO GET INVOLVED WITH PRODCUING...."
3,WWE Wreckless Intent,"This album isn't that bad. I use to like it alot better when they contained entrance music that you are accustomed to hearing, rather than ones that are going to be played after the album's release. When the old WWE ""The Music"" albums came out, the majority of the songs on there were ones that you could listen to and immediately idenfity who's music it was. I don't like the idea of having to read the back of the cover to see what I'm listening to. I'm just old school I guess..."
4,a nice little compilation,"I bought this to hear Michael McDonald's Have a Merrybut the whole cd ended up to be a very nice little compilation.Easy listening...great backround music....not bad. Let me say,that Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas is off the charts.He smokes it and it could possibly be the best version of thissong anywhere. Check it out."
2,If you want to know more about CI - buy other books!,"If this is the FIRST book you read on Competitive Intelligence - it is not that bad; It covers much ground at a fast pace. However, if you have read any of the other books out on CI (Fuld's CI Blue Monster, or even Michael Porter's On Competition) this book is rehashed material that is too elementary to gain any sort of knowledge to furtherer your CI knowledge base. I commend the authors for a good start - but was hoping for much more detail."
3,A decent headset for the price,"I was surprised at how good this headset sounded after I received them. For the price I was sure they would suck, but they did not. The audio playback quality is a bit muddy at first, but then after a while of using them I compared them to my older headphones and found they had much better sensitivty and low end response. The audio still doesn't seem as accurate but it is an improvement.Comfort wise the headsets suck at first. After a few hours of usage I got used to them, though I still think they could do with more padding (textured too to avoid slipage).Recording quality was mediocre to low. I had to turn the mic recording volume all the way up AND use the gain boost function to get a loud test recording. In counter-strike the voice comes back a bit crackly and I'm wondering if it is because I had to turn up the boost so much or because the mic sucks. Still though the other gamers on the receiving end say they can understand me just fine."
4,"Plus on Sound, Minus on Volume Control","I found the Logitech Premium Stereo Headset comfortable to wear with good sound quality. The volume adjustment bezel was, however, small, very difficult to turn and made it extra hard to get the exact volume I was looking for. I haven't had an opportunity to try the microphone. But if you are looking for a good headset at a low price and don't mind the minor inconvenience of the volume adjustment, this is the product for you."
1,"Sound is great, Mic is a letdown","I bought this headset hoping to use it to play World of Warcraft. The audio sounds great, but the microphone lasted less than a month. I returned it and bought another, then tried it again - with same results. I am returning it again and looking at another manufacturer for a new headset - very disappointed with the mic lifespan on this one."
3,"The inline volume control froze, but fortunately it froze on medium volume","You may not be so lucky...And no, I didn't do anything crazy like pour superglue into the opening, I simply plugged it in and left it untouched except for when I put it on my head or took it off and put it on the table...Aside from the issue of the immovable inline volume control, it works fine for me. Still, I recommend buying another brand, or at least another model, since this oneLogitech Premium Stereo Headset with Noise-Canceling Microphonehas issues."
5,Very pleased.,"Reasonably sturdy construction, perhaps a bit too rigid, clear midrange, a bit lacking in lows, decent highs, noise cancelation on the mic (this is not a noise-canceling headphone) is respectable for a headset in this price range; that is, none of my Skype contacts have any complaints. Final word: for the price, an excellent buy. It's a budget call, really. Keep in mind that mics are known to die on the cheapest headsets on upwards, so this was a good compromise for me. I was actually debating between a Juster on newegg, this, and the Sennheiser on sale here on Amazon. Contently listening to music as I write this review."
3,"Adequate, but not comfortable","My listeners told me that they can hear me fine, so the performance is decent. However, on my end, Skype said that it couldn't hear me so I spent a while trying to fix that, even though I didn't need to. Plus, they aren't very comfortable to wear for long periods of time."
2,Not good,"Bought this in 2008, product broke in less than a year. I would avoid and buy something better. The sound quality isn't that great and the plastic can snap off easy if you accidentally sit on it or bend it."
1,Don't do it.,"I've had this set a little over a year now. I've run into three problems with it that would cause me never to purchase another.1.) Extremely uncomfortable. The earphone padding is very cheap and with in 15-20 minutes your ears will begin to hurt, for users that wear glasses it is even worse. The pressure will hurt your ears and press your glasses ear pieces up against your head causing you even more discomfort.2.) The boom mic and overall plastic used on this headset is very weak. The first week I owned this set I was breaking out the duct tape for a repair.3.) Wiring connection going into the headset is weak.4.) Sound quality is average, weak base, adequate sound record ability."
1,Low Quality Headset,"One of the worst headsets I've ever owned. The headset is very uncomfortable to wear, and I can never get the microphone to record loudly enough no matter how much I fiddle with the controls."
