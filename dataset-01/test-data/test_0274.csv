4,A Little Book about Big Things,"Wow...this book must be the ligthtest heavy reading I've ever done. But then again, how else could a book about the papacy be only 100 pages?I may be describing this book as light heavy reading, but it's like this: most things I got on the first read; a few things I had to read two or three times.Still, though...I'm completely surprised the authors were able to make it that simple. If there's one thing I know, it's that the papacy is a complex topic. This book does an excellent job at helping the reader learn about the papacy and gets past those complexities with flying colors.Everything most people would ever want to know about the papacy is in here; and, for you overachievers, there's an appendix at the end of the book. I, for one, would like to know more about their motto's."
3,10 videos? That's all?,"The idea of a Toby Keith video collection is an excellent one but only 10 videos? There's room for at least double that and then some, and it's not as though TK hasn't made plenty of videos. Love Toby Keith but hate the rip-off record and DVD companies."
5,GO GET IT!,"As already mentioned above....do not question the price! It is really worth every single cent! I am not a LRE-designer nor do I work in any similar branche...you'll need to work yourself through the subject and especially through the mathematics, but you will be able to design your own rocket motor. It really goes into detail.This is not only one of the best books I own...it is THE BEST!GO GET IT!"
5,Hang On To Your Pants!,"This was my first Thompson novel. I loved it. This novel keeps on going, through the entire book. There wer no boring spots at all in this novel. This is the kind of story I love to read, straight to the point in every chapter. The characters were very well written. I thought Natalie was spectacular! This novel was hard to put down, I could not wait to find out what other twists and turns were in the following chapter. There are many characters in this story and you never know which one is doing what. The ending was simply awesome, I would have never guessed that the killer was ??????????, can't tell ya, read for yourself. This is a must read novel if you love thrills, suspence and a mixture of characters. Hats off to Carlene Thompson, I look forward to reading her other novels. Hold on and go for a great spin with this one."
3,Not quite how i thought it would end!,"I read this book recently and was just enthralled with it. I really liked the story of a haunted school. That was till i got to the ending. you think its a horror novel till the end. to me it was more like a sci-fi story. It was a good story, just not scary!"
4,It's a winner,"The emergency hammer is 16cm long and 9.5cm wide from hammer tip to tip. Handle is made of textured black plastic that is easy to grip. There is a recessed blade in the handle for cutting yourself out of a seatbelt. The orange triangular reflector at the top is just a little mylar sticker (kinda pointless,really). The whole thing snaps into a plastic holder that can be screwed to a rigid surface. I like this hammer because it is black and blends seamlessly with my vehicle interior (no blaze orange for me, thank you). Also; it has two impact heads, where others have only one."
5,A compelling read,"I loved this book! When I finished it, I found myself missing the characters something awful. Pastan has successfully updated Austen's Pride & Prejudice by exploring the age-old issues of meddling mothers, jealous sisters, disappointing suitors and the drive to mate with humor, wit and intelligence. The story draws you in and deftly adds characters and plot twists that keep you engaged throughout."
5,Sally Is Wonderful,"Best kept secret in music. She has her own voice, and writes damn good songs. This is the first record that really shows her talent. Better buy several copies at once so you won't have to fight people for it.."
4,"Post-Thunder Chord, but really getting close to what will be Tear of the Moon",If you've read any of my other CO reviews then you know I hold that is isThunder Chordwhere CO really found their sound. Then it seems they wandered around again untilTear of the Moon. You can tell that CO was not yet trusting the drone tones to do their magic. But it's very listenable and one of their best works that deserves to be in any CO library.
1,From the Mailbox to the Trash,"This is a review of what I read from the mailbox to the trash. The book is more of a dictionary of alchemists or those that prolonged the study of alchemy in the face of modern science. Grimoire was not even included as an entry. Waite's extensive textually critical analysis of extant books debunching the more ficticious publications of his time did not even get a footnote in this dictionary. The famous Alchemist's Gate that spurred generations of 'research' missed the publication deadline. The elements were tapered to those earlier than Plato BC period and excluded Plato's aether (not that Plato was the ultimate encourager of free thinking, he sabatoged the advancement of mathematics for generations with the geometry only edict). A full page is devoted to Jung with his psychobabble that totally ignored the fact that contrary to Jungian presuppositions and extant evidence alchemists of the past did perform and document their non-metephysical experiments."
2,Not great,"I tried this work-out once and wasn't very impressed. The cardio circuits are too short to get your heart rate up, and Karen doesn't explain most of the complicated footwork at all before you need to start doing it. By the time you figure out what she's doing, she's already on to another move. As far as the strength training, some of the weights circuits are decent, but it's definitely not for beginners. I have a delicate neck, and I got a migraine after the first 5 minutes of upper body. If you are a beginner, I would try using 2-3 pound weights at first. Then maybe work up to 5 lb. weights. Overall, it sounded like a good work-out in the description, but I won't be doing it again."
2,Recycled Material,"My experience with other Karen Voight DVDs and videos has been very positive, especially with her ""Sleek Physique"" DVD. Unfortunately, I felt a bit cheated having purchased ""Burn and Firm"", since the segments on it are identical to the ""Sleek Physique"", cut and pasted into different combinations and missing the very well done yoga strength and yoga stretch segments. I recommend ""Sleek Physique"" instead of this one."
4,British royals - image and dress through the centuries,"This book takes you through five centuries of royal dress from 1580 to the 1980s and concentrates on the differences between how dress used in portraits etc and the reality of what rulers actually wore. To do this, throughout the book are illustrations, mostly black and white, that are then commented on in detail. These comments are full of interesting titbits of information on the dress of the various periods/ rulers discussed.There's a lot in this book, but it's not a ""pretty"" book. It has a small colour section in the centre of pictures, but it's the black and white illustrations and their commentary which is where you'll get the real value out of this book. With the 1860s you start to get photographs and the story finishes with Princess Diana and Sarah Ferguson in their early royal careers in 1988. For anybody who is interested in royal dress this book is filled with interesting, obscure facts on British royalty and fashion and recommended."
3,"Good book, but a little dry.","This book was good, if a little dry. The main character Mina, isn't strong enough for me to be on her side, or evil enough to be attracted to the dark aspect of the story. The main way that she connects with the god of the dead is through sex. It's kind of lame, considering other characters Weis is famous for (Raist) have greed, ambition, and sheer talent running through their viens. The ""hero""(s) in the story are believable, yet they still failed to really inspire me. The death knight was pathetic, I didn't feel any ""sothiness"" about him at all! But, it won't keep me from buying the sequal. The storyline is good enough to keep me from being bored."
3,Well written but dull characters,"I've read many Weis and Hickman books and this has to be one of the worst main characters I've read about..It gets 3 stars because the story has a sense of purpose,it was well written, and I can't wait to read what happens in the next book,but the major problem with this is the dull main character.. I think Rhys is probably the most boring main character I've ever read about which is half the reason for the 3 stars..Mina is one of my favorite characters because of her loyalty and faithfulnes,but the romance scenes between her and chemosh could have been toned down a notch..I did like Nightshade the Kender but even Chemosh started to get annoying.. Like I said,the main characters seemed a bit dull and boring,but the overall story and direction of the novel was pretty good..I've taken a break from Weis for a while,but I'll be sure to read Amber and Iron soon to see what happens next :)"
2,full of typos,"I thought the plot was ok and I personally like Mina but I had trouble getting through the book because it is full of typos. Very dissapointing quality, editing wise."
4,"Very good book, not as good as Classic Weis","This is one of the best fantasy books i've read, and should be an excellent trilogy. BUT, its not as good as classic Weis books. I consider the Legends trilogy and Soulforge to be some of the best BOOKS ever written, so its hard for this to match up. But, if you arn't looking for something to change your worldview the way Legends did, I think you'll thoroughly enjoy this book."
1,No honor in this epic.,I thought it would be like Red Cliff. It was a terrible movie making betrayal seem honorable. It sent message that honor had no value.
2,Confusing spectacle,"No one could fault the production values. But this movie is confusing as hell. Character decisions, conversations and plot points appear incoherently, without enough explanation or exposition or motivation. It's often hard to tell where things are happening, where people are, why they're there, who they're talking about ... All a disjointed mess. Jet Li does a good job playing a confusing character, though."
3,What's all the buzz about?,My God I came on line to order this film and noticed all of the reviews so I read them and talk about going from one extreme to the other. Who do you people think you are Siskel & Ebert? I have not even seen this movie and I'll tell ya now that my take on it is this. If you can actually go out and make a better film then do it and then write your review. Until then forget it.Mr Reality
1,good movie my @$$,"THIS MOVIE SUCKS BIG TIME HOW IN THE HELL ANYONE THINK THIS MOVIE IS GOOD IS BEYOND ME, MAYBE THEY NEED TO HAVE THEIR HEAD EXAMINED. (AND I WON'T GET OVER IT.) FUNNY HOW THE GOOD REVIEWS ARE ALL COMING FROM CALIFORINA ON THE SAME DAY HMMMMMM!!! AS FOR HOW I GOT THE MOVIE BEFORE IT CAME OUT, I TOO HAVE A FRIEND AT BB, THAT'S HOW I KNOW IT SUCKS BIG TIME, AHEAD OF TIME, THANK YOU. LAST TIME I CHECKED THIS IS A FREE COUNTRY IF I THOUGHT THE MOVIE SUCKED I AM ALOWED TO SAY SO, JUST LIKE YOUR ALOWED TO SAY HOW GOOD THIS MOVIE IS. NOW WHO'S BEING SMALL MINDED. I THINK SOME OF THE REVIEWERS ARE CAST MEMBERS OR STAFF MEMBERS ON THIS FILM."
4,"Well, there's SOME Beatlesworthy material here at least","Three and a half stars, actually. For a post-1960s Beatles collection, lift the high-energy fusion instrumental `Hari's on Tour' and the equally high-energy New Year's Eve melee called `Ding Dong Ding Dong'. For a Covers set: George's crazed autobiographical re-working of `Bye bye Love'. `Maya Love' and a quite abbreviated version of `It is He...' could go onto a bonus set. `Dark Horse', the song, is very good, but it's the non-hoarse version from George's 1991 Japan tour that makes it a Beatlesworthy pick."
4,Dark Horse Years,"Hari's on tour is an instramental piece that is upbeat new york sound, with a nice touch of the sax.Simply Shady dark lyrics is an expression of George's personal struggles at the time.So Sad, is my favorite song, with a wonderful 12 string guitar shows the special Harrison sound. The Lyrics are story telling like ""Let it roll""Bye Bye, Love a remake of the Everly Brothers song, would be a good B-side on a 45.Maya Love, sounds a bit like Bye Bye, Love, nothing special.Ding Dong, Ding Dong, I love this song, would be a good new years song, or new beginings song. Like Lennon's Happy Xmas song.Dark Horse, George's raspy voice, very different from his other softer songs.Far East Man, is a very nice song, ""this is Franks song, we love you Frank."" Nice Saxaphone. A soft laid back continuation of ""Bangladesh""It is ""HE"" (Jai Sri Krishna) A Hindu religous theme."
2,Not so good a record.,"First of all let me say that I love George Harrison. I own all of his CD's. I am sad that he is no longer with us. However Dark Horse is still not a very good record and no matter how much I love some of Harrison's other records, Dark Horse still is not a very good album. The songs Dark Horse and Hari's On Tour are very good. The totally over looked Ding Dong, Ding Dong which cracked the top 40 as a single is a catchy song. The remainder of Dark Horse unfortunately is very forgettable. Harrison's voice is in bad shape throughout the album and the production here also is not very strong. Most of the songs here are also not very well written. If you are looking for good Harrison records to buy, start with All Things Must Pass, Cloud Nine, and Living In the Material World. All of the above mentioned are wonderful to listen to."
2,Harrison finally hits middle of the road,"This is a sore dissappointing follow up to the previous ""Living In the Material World"", which showcased some stunning moments.Sadly, that charm is lacking here. Harrison recorded this shortly after his widespread tour in 1974. It's not like he had to issue any product at all, since ""Dark Horse"" was originally released on his own Apple label.The album has a few moments, most notably with ""So Sad"" and an unusual version of the Everly Brothers ""Bye Bye Love"".To make matters worse, the two singles that were culled from the album were not the best tracks on it, so, I guess that says something about the remaining material.Knowing ""Dark Horse"" was not that popular upon its initial release, it's easy to see why the CD issue has been very difficult up until this time to obtain.At best, it's STILL George Harrison, and it's STILL good. Well worth a listen to."
4,"light rock, very artsy in its approach.",i hate to give this only four stars but five tells people that the reviewed album is perfect and i don't think that any album i have is worth that rating. this is one of the few albums that i find that is really different. with today's music being so flooded with the same stuff this is a welcome departure from the mondane. they aren't mainstream yet which makes them that much more appealing. i look forward to hearing more from these boys soon. you should also check their three song demo.
5,Essential for any Kraftwerk,"This is from a '04 concert. The music and visuals are nice to see. It also explains why some of the songs lyrics are the way they are (ex: THE MAN MACHINE MACHINE MACHINE MACHINE MACHINE MACHINE MACHINE MA-CHI-NE). Although they didn't do much for visuals, this was expected for 2004 & NOW of you look at their live concerts, everything.There was one minor defect with my DVD however I'm not lowering the review because of the error. My disk 1 was labeled disk 2 & my disk 2 was labeled disk 1. It worried me at first because I thought I had gotten two disk 2's, but, nothin my label maker can't fix.Overall, this is a good DVD, however if you really study the videos, you can see they reuse footage a lot and even used some footage from the GERMAN version."
2,Dry and bland...,"I'm going to have to go against everyone else's reviews here so far, because I found this rice to be both dry and very bland. It's certainly not delicious, and I was extremely disappointed, particularly because I bought it on the strength of the other reviews here.For those curious, I made this in my Zojirushi (made in Japan) rice cooker, which makes perfect rice every time.On the plus side, it certainly is healthy, and other people seem to like it, but I didn't at all."
5,Great Rice Combo,"This is a really delicious combination. I use a rice steamer, and it works perfectly."
4,"Sad, Shocking and Hard to Put Down","Overall I really liked Imbrie's telling of this awful crime. When a book makes me feel like I am actually there I am impressed. I often read true crime accounts and sympathize with the victims, but Imbrie's writing really gave me that eerie feeling like Lee could have been any one of us. I think her writing style is different and I really liked the book."
1,Doesn't work like I wanted it,It turns on the xbox360 and that's about it. Wanted to use it for Netflix purposes and it fails.
3,It works OK,"Got this so I could browse netflix, etc. I dig the shape, feels good in your hand. The Xbox button is way up at the top, It should really be closer to the middle, but ok, at least it has one. Buttons sometimes take a little convincing, gotta hit it twice occasionally, could be the xbox app or the remote idk.PROSIt worksBacklightCONSYou have to point it right at the darn xbox to get it to workSticky buttons"
3,Lousy range,The remote functions well but only works within 5 feet of the TV.I might try another one of the other remotes on here so I can actually use it from the couch.
2,Like new they say... right!,"It was advertise ""like new"" Yea right, most of the button are completely erased and you cannot guess what they are for. but it was cheap and I was too cheap to pay $10 more to get a new one. My mistake."
1,works okay,"""very fast shipment. highly recommended. however, the light shuts off very early not giving enough time to see the controls. at least it can stay on for 3-4 seconds. but shuts off as soon as you depress the x button. lightniing fast shipment from seller. i bought another from ebay and the customer service was very poor and bad. and ebay removed my negative feedbaack rating for that seller. """
4,Very well-built product,"Very well-built remote, and of course perfect if you are doubling your X-Box 360 as a Windows Media-Center Extender. But the one short coming like all 'green-button' remotes no matter who makes it is the lack of a 'go forward' button (thanks again, Microsoft)."
2,Those Buttons...,"I'm not happy with the buttons on this remote. They're spongy and they miss a lot. The left and right arrow buttons just feel strange, like not natural at all."
4,great remote but I wished it would work on my surround sound!,"great remote everything worked well it controls the T.V and the x box but I really wished that xbox would make it for surround sounds also, so I would just use one remote as oppose to 2."
4,Easy to use,"""Easy to use"". This is a great remote for the Xbox 360. Makes using Apps and dvd player easy to use. It's also backlit so no fumbling for buttons in the dark."
4,remote control,"works my xbox 360 perfectly,no problems,still cant grt it to work with my tv,but not a problem.bought it for dvd use only.great product"
5,Best Feature,"The Best part of this remote, is the worst part of using an Xbox 360 controller. When using the controller, you generally have to be very careful how you set it down. If you accidentally bump one of the triggers, it'll fast-forward, or rewind your program; so generally you have to turn off and back on your controller whenever you need it. With the remote, all you have to do is pick it up, and use it. No more having to be extra cautious with your controller. Highly recommended for that feature alone, if nothing else."
4,It's pretty handy!,"Pros: It's preprogrammed to work with all xBox 360's including the slim, and has easy setup for TV controls.Cons: It won't hook up to my new tv correctly, the input button doesn't work with my RCA TV and the volume goes up 2 instead of just 1, but it works just fine with my Panisonic TV(input and volume)"
2,Good but not great,"Remote is nice to have but one major problem is It doesn't seem to control the TV inputs so you can't switch from the TV input to any of the other inputs, so if you want to go from watching TV to playing or watching xbox 360 you need your regular TV remote. There is a button that says input/clear but it doesn't switch between inputs on my TV. Unless I'm doing something wrong? If it controlled the inputs it would be great."
3,Universal Xbox360 Remote,"It's great to have a Xbox360 Universal Remote, but the buttons on this product are not sensitive, and it takes 4-5 attempts at getting the numbers and other certain buttons to work properly."
3,Works as expected - with one flaw.,"This is great for using the Xbox 360 as a media center extender. much simpler than trying to navigate the menus with a controller. I was a little disappointed that I could not find a code to make the TV functions (power, volume, mute, channel) work but I have an obscure brand TV so I wasn't too suprised. I've also read that Vizio's may not be controllable through this remote. I am planning on buying a new TV this year so I'm hoping the next one will work.This would be better if it were a learning remote so I could teach it the functions of my off-brand TV. Other than that, a great product."
5,Far superior than the new remote.,"This (older verion) Xbox 360 remote is far superior to the new remote.My current remotes buttons became unresponsive and required several presses, or, a very firm press, to engage them. I took the remote apart and found that a oily film was between the rubber and board causing the issue. I rinsed the button membrane and cleaned the board with alcohol, put back together, and the remote functions like new. However, the years of use has rubbed the ink off the buttons... so... it's sometimesd very difficult to know(remember) what buttons are what! Which is why I purchased a new remote.My plan is to take some type of clear sealer and coat the tops of the buttons so the ink will not rub off. But what kind? A paint sealer? Clear fingernail Polish? I'm not sure."
3,After seeing it I bought a Craftsman level,"A local store sells these, so I got to examine one closely before deciding which level to buy.pros:1. VERY solid construction. Much more rigid that the Craftsman that I did buy after considering all of the factors.2. Bumpers at ends in case of an accidental drop (good idea).3. Cut away center bubble is very visible.cons:1. The lines surrounding the bubbles are too far apart. My opinion is that they ought to be the sane size as the bubble so that the edges of the bubble are precisely at the lines when level. This is why I bought the Craftsman.2. The machined surfaces have a very rough surface finish. I designed equipment for a living and the company machine shop would have been embarrassed to mill anything with such a poor finish."
5,1977 Trans Am,I love this car so mutch i have alot of fun with it i love T/as love Mark Shane Slaven
3,Clarifying cream,I purchased this cream to help reduce spider veins but it hasn't had much effect. I wouldn't purchase it again.
1,Replying back,I dislike because it is difficult to do by myself also alot of my bras straps dont unhook also found that it was to tight so I was very unsatified with your product Nora Lantz
1,What a disappointment!,"I have narrow shoulders and I ALWAYS have trouble with falling bra straps. I thought this product would be the solution for me, but I'm very disappointed with it. I was completely unable to get it on by myself unless I put it up really high and then it felt like my straps were choking me since they were almost around my neck. Once you get it on you cannot slide it down like it shows in the little video. My husband put it on for me and then it made my bra feel tight and uncomfortable. It basically turns every bra into a racer back.Don't waste your money!"
5,You will want to read it again!!!,"Do you find yourself wanting to pray to the Father, but lackingthe vocabulary to express what is on your heart? This book contains 52 short stories that each homeschooling mother can easily relate to and laugh with! After each story is a genuine prayer that you will treasure. I highly recommend this ENCOURAGING book!"
4,Still a fantastic movie!,"The image on Blu-ray is a little soft compared to more recent movies because of the way it was shot, but the picture and sound are still miles better than the standard DVDs. Totally worth the upgrade."
3,Not up to par,"Having already read book one of this triology I had some high expectations. Book one was good, and kept me guessing. Book two was a little bit of a let down. In my opinion part of the book goes into too much detail. Parker got a little too wordy for me with the explanations of the Forge and what it takes to make different items. Thats why I gave it a three star. Overall I enjoyed Poldarn and his misadventures and how everything just seemed to go wrong with anything he did. Book two did leave me hanging, but thats ok because its the middle of a series and what do you expect. If you read book one and liked it, book two won't be that bad for you. Parker still keeps you guessing about the origins of Poldarn. The reader is shown more about the life of Poldarn but his true origins remain hazy. I am looking forward to reading book three."
5,Essential tool to help kids on the spectrum cope with the rigors of school,"This is an incredible book, full of practical suggestions designed to reduce the angst and strife of school life for children on the Autism spectrum. It also has an assortment of ready-to-use forms/templates that we were able to put to immediate use to allay some of our child's fears--changes in routine, for instance--in school. It's been written in an easy, lucid style, and is an absolute page-turner. It is so insightful that certain passages are bound to resonate with the reader's own personal case: I know that in our own case, we came across several that caused us to break out in gooseflesh.If you have a child on the spectrum, who has issues in school, and you can only afford one book, make it this one. You can find Attwood's bible, Kranowitz's gospel (&c.;) at the local library."
2,SchoolPsych2007,This book is a great primer for parents and staff just learning about Asperger Syndrome. It was too basic for me as a professional who works with Asperger's Syndrome. It may be a good resource for professionals to give to parents to help them work with the schools.
2,Well....,"I appreciate where this movie was going, I just didn't enjoy the ride. All of the talented actors in this movie and it was a snoozefest. I gave it two stars because it was o.k., but it could have been a lot better."
1,HORRIBLE!,DID NOT EVEN FINISH IT. I USUALLY DO NOT WRITE REVEIWS BUT NEEDED TO WARN EVERYONE ABOUT THIS WASTE OF TIME.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR YOUR TIME. GREAT NAMES IN MOVIE BUT THAT IS ALL.
5,Great spin to a love story,"This was a good movie with a great plot and storyline, a very refreshing twist to the traditional love story."
5,Yummy,"This is very quick to cook, an very easy. I love to have it on hand to use when every I am in a rush and need a pasta type item to go with the main dish."
1,This title is encoded in 1080i50 and will not play in most US Blu-ray players,"This will not play in most US Blu-ray players including PS3 because it is encoded in 1080i50 (50Hz) video which is common in Europe. Even though it's not region coded, since most US TVs and Blu-ray players cannot handle 50Hz refresh rate, you will not be able to see any picture with this title."
1,Blu-ray disks don't perform,"I bought two copies of this concert, one for my son, and one for a friend. When we tried to view them we found that the concerts don't play on any of my Bluray players. Beware, this appears to be a quality issue, and you don't want to get suckered into owning a malfunctioning disc. I will attempt to return these to Amazon for replacements that work."
1,TechFlex 3/4 Clean Cut Sleeving - Not up to par...,"Don't waste your money. First it is not clean cut as advertised. When you cut it with scissors, it unravels. Not everyone has a hot knife to seal the ends. I bought the sleeving to organize printer cords and it seemed like it was a product that would work. However, the hype outpaces the reality and utility of the product."
3,Quick reads,"I enjoyed each of these stories within a day or so. They are light and fun. Since this book has two stories, though, neither showed much depth. They're just quick reads to enjoy to make you happy."
1,Not as graceful an exit as Mr. Bond deserves,"Sean Connery is without a doubt the best Bond ever. But by the time this movie was made, the formula which made him such was lost, and only recently has Pierce even come close. The movie follows the same basic formula as some of Moore's cheesiest bond titles (aka View to a Kill), using high tech gadgets and special effects to make up for a lack of panache and storyline. As has been said before, aim for Thunderball... the story is similar, but the classic bond flair and style are there. In truth there is no comparision"
2,A disgrace to James Bond films!,"This film, in my opinion, is one of thhe worst Bond films ever made. Even though I am a Sean Connery fan, this movie just has a really boring plot, a really un-convincing villian, etc."
1,Never Say I Didn't Warn You,"I'm not a techie and when I ordered this DVD I had no idea what ""Region 2"" meant. (Ithought maybe it was being shipped from out East or somewhere outside the Midwest.)Now I know Region 2 means I'm having trouble getting it to work in our DVD player. It's just not worth the struggle, not for a James Bond flick or any other. Now youcan Never Say Never You Haven't Been Warned."
2,"A very good James Bond movie, but a cut version !!!",4 minutes are missing in this version of Never Say Never Again : only the VHS cut is complete !!!
3,Never Say Never Again Revisited.,"It is a long time since I last saw this film & I could not remember the plot, but I do remember it as being the return of the quintessential Bond, Sean Connery. I was not dissappointed when as a late Easter present my wife bought it for me, I am a total Bond addict! It is not so full of modern day Bond weapons or gadgetry, but it is more like the first half dozen, a little more sophisticated where Bond had to use his brains & stealth to get himself out of trouble rather than fantastic pyrotechnics. There are the compulsory vehicles, beautiful women & well known characters in the form of Leiter & ""M"" & the inevitable down to the last minute conclusion, so all in all, despite the lack of the usual gun barrel beginning & Bond theme, it is a thouroughly enjoyable film in the vintage vein of Bond. Well worth watching."
5,A great bond film!,"Sean Connery makes his last appearance as James Bond. Classic 007 film, good acting, plot, and lots of action. 5 out of 5! One of my personal favorites in the 007 series."
2,NEVER WATCH NEVER AGAIN,"From coming from a Big Bond fan. I live and breath Bond Movies. This would (NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN) bring all Bond movies to shame, luckily, this movie isn't considered a Bond Movie.It's a remake, mistake, of Sean Connery's Thunderball.Sean Connery, being one of my favorite Bonds ever, and mostly everyone elses, would have to agree how bad they made him look on here as Bond.The movie is cheap, and boring, hardly any action to a normal Bond Movie (DR. No-Die Another Day).Not worth getting, or even watching in any case.Save yourself time, don't watch this one, it's not considered a Bond Movie... Wonder why....NEVER WATCH NEVER AGAIN."
1,"Not as bad as You Only Live Twice, but thats not saying much","This movie (a Warner bros picture and not officially a part of the James Bond series) is a turkey! My god, can Connery get much older looking? The simple fact that this is a remake of Thunderball is enough reason to stay away. It's better than You Only Live Twice, but thats not saying much. The video game sequence for world domination is incredibly stupid. Connery should have stayed retired, stayed out of the Arcades and out of Octopussy's wake(a hit Bond film released the same year). STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE... you've been warned."
1,Totally Unsatisfactory,Never Say Never AgainThis product was shipped from Belgium. It arrived one day AFTER the last returndate. The DVD will NOT play on any DVD player I have....it is imcompatible ornot allowed on this continent.I am unable to find a way to contact customer service at Amazon.com.This is the pits.
2,The WORST 007 of all-time!,"Unless you consider Casino Royale- with David Niven part of the franchise- this is the clear cut worst Bond ever made. You have to be a die-hard Bond fan to say you like this-it's bad folks. The Blu-ray version is better as you would expect, but as much as you want to shine this turd -it's still a turd.If you haven't seen Dr. No, Goldfinger, Thunderball, and the BEST Bond - From Russia with love- (even if you have) see them or see them again. Don't buy this- it will be $9 soon if you really want it."
2,Sorry to say this about a Bond Movie,I never thought i would say this but i am sorry to have seen this particular movie made. Whilst Sean Connery turns in a good performance the rest of the cast and indeed the plot leaves something to be desired in their performance and indeed their standard and it is well apparant that the usual Bond Team was not involved in the production of this movie. If your a Bond fan then maybe give it a look - otherwise give it a miss.
3,A Worthy comeback for the actor most suited to this role,"It was a movie that a lot of people wish had never been made. Despite holding the rights to the novel Thunderball, in 1983 Sean Connery was divorced from the Bond film machinery that was that same year churning out the lacklustre Octopussy with Roger Moore. So it means the film is without a John Barry soundtrack, the custimary M, Q, & Moneypenny actors, and a Pinewood Set.Having said that Connery aquits himself admirably in the role, just avoiding looking as old as Roger Moore. There was no reason Connery shouldn't have played Bond during the entire Moore Era, as this film proves. The script, with contributions from Dick Clement and Ian Le Frenais sparkles with wit and is helped by such star turns as Rowan Atkinson, Klaus Maria Von Brandauer, and Kim Basinger. Yes, the plot is the same as Thunderball, but this overlooks the fact that there is only one James Bond plot anyway.A re-release on video' is well overdue."
2,Don't be fooled,"This comes from a fan who has followed R. Kelly from Public Announcement and Jay-Z from Reasonable Doubt. This could have been the stuff of legend, a collaboration for the ages. Instead, we get a preproduced package album with unimaginative beats and even weaker lyrics. What should have been a groundbreaking album, turned out to be two established hip-hop heavyweights treading over the familiar ground of Cristal, Money, and the pull of the female anatomy. Take a pass on this one and hope for better things to come."
2,very average,"I can't stand Jay Z at all.His by the Numbers Rapping is Boring to me.I was hyped to see another side to the Versatile Genius of R.Kelly but this Album never really gets going like that.the title Track is banging as are a couple other tracks,but beyond that it's more show than go. R.kelly already did the Best of Both worlds with Biggie."
3,Ture Hip Hop Head,"OK...The original concept of this album was cool. When we look at this album we have to ask ourselves what has this done for hip hop as a culture and also what has this done for hip hop financially. Financially this was a great move. Who doesn't like R.Kelly and Jigga. Despite being a lack luster album it will go platnium. Now as a culture benifiting move...I could not have been more disappointed. Hip Hop as a black owned culture should be represented by more than just a portrayal of men being sex hungry maniacs, Money Grubbers, and Party Animals. Now this is not a bad album at all....BELIEVE ME!! Songs like ""These Streets"" show as a people what a lot of us have been through but alas these type of songs on this album are diamonds in the rough. Artist like Jay Z and R. Kelly financially fund hip hop and are true artists but as for this album I would have liked to see more innovation and less sex, money, and profanity. ONE!"
1,The Worst of Both Worlds,"Thats right, rap and r&b finally come up with a collabo with two of the most talented artists and it turns out to be the worst of both worlds. First of all we all know that all of R. Kelly's albums have been amazing and so has Jay-Z's. But, what is this?? I was expecting something like the awesome collabo fiesta (remix) with Jay-Z and R. Kelly. All of the songs on here are just horribly done without question and so bad you can't even pretend you like them...From the two best rap and r&b artists this is amazingly a very, VERY bad album and should of had another year to work on it...Jay-z could of waited until Blueprint came out before this couldn't he of??"
1,sad...,"after the average dynasty lp and a classic with blueprint jay-z brought another album with r.kelly called 'best of both worlds'... they wanna kiddin' me?! this aint hip hop, just party pop. i just got some luv for the track named 'the streets' but the rest is unimportant garbage!! the beats are incomprehensibly wack and jiggas bars are kinda ridiculous! plus mr. untouchable 'rnb thug' (haha) kelly showed his fans in the past that he's the most arrogant mtv singer out there! don't cop that!"
3,Deserves more love...,"Don't believe the negative hype, this album isn't as disastrous as reported, it has some worthy moments. While admittedly the material here does have a rushed feel, poor lyrics (""Sex, money, sex, money..."" and often made up of recycled lines) and doesn't rate amongst either artists' premier work, it's nonetheless a welcome release, particularly for fans of either/both men.The explosive introductive title track is the overall highlight in my opinion. While the remainder of the LP may not come good on it's initial promise, other bangers for the clubs include ""Take You Home"", ""Break Up To Make Up"" and ""Get This Money"". There's even time for a R. Kelly solo joint in ""Naked"".Good beats combine with addictive melodies (The duo in fine vocal form) and if taken simply as is, ""The Best Of Both Worlds"" can be seen as a fun bonus in addition to R and Jay's higher profile solo output."
3,"Ok product, has some flaws","I went to a customer's home to hang two televisions (it was supposed to have been one) so the customer purchased another wall mount from Walmart for the same price as this one not on sale. The other mount was clearly heavier and stronger even though both mounts were for the same size televisions. This one felt almost flimsy in comparison.The other mount also had a nicer system for tilting - this one, although using a wing nut system to tighten or loosen the tilt mechanism, includes screws to lock in the tilt. The problem is the screws are located in such a place that they are nearly impossible to remove and replace with large hands such as mine.Other than those complaints, the mounting went well and the product does seem to be strong enough to handle the television that we mounted (a 50"" plasma). Given the choice between the two, I would go with the Walmart mount in the future."
5,Easy Stuff,"I had to write a review because when I pulled all the stuff out of the box I thought this thing was going to be a nightmare to put together. Bags of screws, tons of directions.However, I used two little bags of hardware, 8 screws and 4 washers and that was it. So the rest of the hardware is there because this thing can be used with so many models of TVs they include every possible adapter and screw to make it universal. And the directions were in three languages so I only needed four pages. Whew!!! Wish someone had told me!!SO, when you remove that bag of screws and all the parts, realize it is already put together and you just need to choose the parts needed for your particular TV. And they give you a really nice spreadsheet that tells you what to use.Took me about an hour and a half and I'm not the type to have tools in my garage. HA.Have fun. Worth the work.e:)Evan"
3,"Great product, but...","I purchased this wall mount after reading several favorable reviews and that the purchaser had the identical HDTV, Panasonic TH-42PE7U. The installation manual was fairly clear but made no mention of this particular television. A quick email to the customer service got a reply within one day that pretty much any TV with mounting holes up to 29.06 inches horizontally and 17.67 inches vertically would work.I used 5/16"" bolts to secure this to my wall. The top holes were large enough to accommodate this but the bottom holes were smaller. Out came the drill and problem solved. With a little help from my son the TV was up and ready for viewing. Other than the early scare this has worked out really well. The price can't be beat and the materials are first rate."
3,Beware!,"This unit will not fit my 47"" TV. Make sure you measure the distance of between the mounting screws on the back of your set and ensure the wall plate is wider than this by at least a few inches."
3,when mounting to metal studs,"When mounting to metal studs, be sure to obtain some toggle bolts. They are not included in the order."
5,Excellent product at a good price,"I researched a lot of wall mount units before finally deciding on this one. I wanted to make sure I got a good, sturdy mount to be able to hold my 40"" Sony Bravia XBR5, and this one was perfect. Peerless provided step-by-step instructions which were accompanied by a wide range of screws, washers and spacers for just about any brand and model of flat screen you can think of. They also provided 4 large lags to mount the unit to the studs in the wall. One of the really nice things about it is that if you weren't able to mount it directly in the center of the wall, the brackets are able to slide from side-to-side so that you can get your TV as close as possible to where you want it. I would definitly recommend this product to anyone looking to mount their flat screen."
3,Looked Used,"Very functional; however, it looked like the product had been shipped to someone else, returned, repackaged and then sent to me. The packing was old and tattered."
4,neat resource,"The Kingfisher student atlas is a great resourse to have in the library. There are maps of Planet Earth, The world, The Poles, and each continent. Next to each map is facts about each area. Also included with the book is a CD ROM that features over 40 printable maps. This resourse would be great for kids who are writing reports.I enjoyed looking through the book with my family. I learned to use the map key and ledgends with this book.I would recommed this book to others. It is a very useful resource for students in grades 3-7."
2,don't waste your money,"Trust me, all the information in this book is EASILY accessible online at each university's website. I would be surprised if you find this book helpful.The only thing somewhat useful about this book is the way it lists schools according to Degree's offered and State. This only made my internet searching slightly easier, and this alone is not nearly worth the price of the book."
5,Don't overlook some of the tracks on this one,"'Winner in You' is a great CD. Now you may be thinking, 'Why buy this CD when I can buy a greatest hits compilation?"". To that I will say there are some tracks here not available on Patti's greatest hits CDs that should not be missed. Of course everyone knows 'On My Own'. But don't over look the power of 'Oh People', and the sweetness of 'Kiss Away the Pain'. Those tracks are not to be missed."
1,predictable,"Honestly this story lacked the literary diserve I was promised. Poor character development, and I feel that Josh didn't bring enough conflict to the story. Also the ending was predictable."
4,Works Great!,"I never have to use batteries again. All i have to do is put the battery pack in the controller, and when I have to charge it, i plug the wire from the top of the controller to the xbox usb slot."
4,I like it.,"It works great. The only thing is that when it's plugged in, I don't know how full the battery has gotten."
1,"Weak battery, use USBCell instead","My XBox rechargeable packs always seemed to run out of charge in a few hours when playing. Also, within 6 months to a year they would hold no charge at all, making them useless. The charging cord was a pain, too.I found USBCell rechargeable AA batteries that fit in the XBox controller AA battery pack. 2 USB AA batteries are cheaper than the Play and charge kit; you can play for days rather than hours before they run out of charge, and they don't wear out in 6 months. They charge in a few hours in any USB port. I would recommend the USBCells instead."
4,Does the job,"Overall this product is fine. Since I often forget to charge my battery pack until it dies, it is great that I can the charger into my controller and continue playing rather than running to find batteries while being fragged over and over while disconnected. The battery has a long life, even after almost a year of use I still can go an entire weekend of continuous gaming without charging.The only complaint I have is that the portion of the charger that connects to the contoller/battery pack is a little touchy. Like an old Nintendo cartridge it has to be in the right position for it to work. The green charging light will not come on if the connector is completely in or not in enough. Not enough of a problem to not recommend, but not good enough to warrant a 5 star rating."
3,Great accesssory but not very sturdy,"I frequently game 24+ hours at a sitting. Hi, my name is Celeste and YES, I'm a gamer.I keep my P&C; plugged in constantly and the the thing no longer charges my controller. Why? Because the wire is corrupt - broken.Okay, yeah, I've tripped over it a few times, but my now dead ancient 360 which is supposed to RRoD if you even look at it, was here LOOOOONNNGGG before my Play N Charge and is still good to go if my DVD drive hadn't crapped out on me.You have NO idea the abuse my poor 360 has taken and kept on playing! A few trips and tugs on the the connector line should NOT break this thing!"
2,read this before buying,if you want to be truely wireless then dont buy this. you have to plug it into a usb port or your xbox 360 to charge which means you have to be wired to charge. better off getting batteries or rechargable batteries.
1,Bad battery pack,"This product was not ""like new condition"" and the battery pack will not charge so I just paid $12 to turn my wireless controller into a wired one."
2,no...,"The only reason i gave this product 2 stars is that it is more cost effective than replacing disposable batteries. This basically changes a wireless controller into a wired one, while yes you can play and charge, but it takes way too long. Rechargeable batteries isnt bad idea, but i'd get the quick charge kit basically same thing as rechargeable batteries only it is made for charging 360 battery packs (comes with one rechargeable battery pack) and is capable of charging two at the same time... extremely quickly... about hour and a half for 1 battery pack and around 3 and a half to 4 hours for 2 battery packs"
4,Reliable yet slightly disillusioned,"This product works GREAT! It recharges and lets me play without giving me lag or trouble. The only negative hit on it is that I bought it with the understanding that when I plug it in, I can turn my controller from wireless to wired. Using this thought, I thought maybe I might be able to use my wireless remote to play my games on my computer too. Unfortunately, when I plugged it in, it did not work. The wire is only used to charge the remote. I still have to get the wireless adapter to be able to use it on my computer. I thought that just by plugging it in, I could use it like a regular remote control. Oh well. At least it recharges when it's attached to my computer."
1,Defective device,"I thought this was new, but was actually refurbished and it arrived defective. I believe the sender is going to charge me shipping or some sort of fee. I think this is totally preposterous and unfounded. I would never buy from this seller again.Thank you,Bernard"
1,This is a junk.,"the wireless did not work before I upgraded the lastest firmware.After the firmware upgraded. the wireless worked for a day thenit drop the connection every 5 minutes. I you want to reset the router every fine minutes, you can buy this junk."
4,Wireless-G with SRX400 Technology Probs with Satellite but great overall,"I purchased this router to use with a HughesNet satellite system. I had problems during the first month with the unit dropping the connection with the modem. I was considering sending it back claiming it was defective. However, the problem had to do with the firmware being out of date and Linksys tech support was very happy to help me update. Ever since the update (on third month now), the router has worked without a single reboot (required several times during the first month). I recommend this router because it has a remarkable range of about 300-400 yards in open landscape). I don't like the antennas are not replaceable with external ones for even greater distance. It also has quite a few incompatibilities with other Linksys products so you need to ask whether it will work with whatever application you're interested in. Works great for my application. Good luck!"
1,Unstable and poorly documented,"I bought this wireless router about six months ago and have had stability problems with it since then. The unit keeps disconnecting from my DSL modem. The DSL line almost never goes down so the problem is with the router. I have called tech support, read all the FAQs and tried all the fixes with no success. I replaced a Netgear router for which I only paid $30 six years ago and I wish I had it back. Avoid this unit..."
1,Wireless stopped working,"I'm never buying from Linksys again. My friend and I both had the WRT54GX4, and both of our routers stopped working after some storms we have in our area. Mind you, just the wireless stopped working. A direct line to it is fine. Seems Linksys didn't make this product very well as it is sensitive to power surges. And yes, both of us use decent surge protectors."
2,Poor quality - giving up...,"After about 4 months of sporadic problems, I've given up and gone to Netgear's MIMO.This device has been problematic every time the power was recycled. I've done complete resets using the reset button on the back (10 seconds) and the wireless, DHCP just don't work anymore. Can't even access the web based administration page using the 192.168.1.1 address.When it worked range was good, but I have to recomend the Netgear at this point.[...]"
2,Linksys WRT54GX4 Wireless-G,"Linksys products over the years have proven to be less than reliable and the WRT54GX4 may be the culmination of this dubious achievement status.Like all Linksys products the main issues are functionality, consistency and ease of implementation. I have only thirty years experience in the IT world which perhaps under qualifies me to properly setup these units.Avoid using these overpriced, under performing products whenever possible and you'll be much happier or disregard this review and find out why millions of people are on a first named basis with Rashis (from Bombay) one of the dozens of friendly customer support individuals sub-contracted by the company to man their very busy customer support lines 24/7. Too bad they can't ad a few more days to the week to take some of the pressure off these nice people."
4,good signal range,"I purchased this product for it's long signal range support. it works fine within my house, no matter where I am. the signals are normally from good to excellent, covering the dead spots too."
3,Have a copy,"My wife picked up a copy of this book at a garage sale. The illustrations, both color and black and white, are quite intriguing, showing where cake decorating was in the first third of the 20th century. Although the recipes are for commercial quantities, a little math and experimenting should reduce them to easier handled quantities for domestic/artisan use. Anyone interested in expanding their horizons on confections and decorating would find this a very interesting addition to their library."
5,Great product for a reasonable price,"For years I've struggled with peroxyde based products who do a good job but have many downturns: they tend to bleach the hair in dark-coated dogs, they sting and they usually become useless a little after the container is opened.I've discovered this product and I cannot do without now: one of my dogs had ear problems as a puppy and requires weekly cleaning but is very sensible to cleaning products. With these swabs I can do it without problems.Recommended, even for ""fussy"" dogs."
5,Very Fast Clip!!!,"I have placed lots of orfers on the net, nothing came faster than the clip! The Pastor will love it!!!Thanks,The Aguila Family"
1,Never received item,I never received the item. I am still trying to figure out what happened and when I can get it (one month later).
5,Great,My truck was having problems and after reading what was causing the problem online. I looked at a couple in town Part stores and searched the web for the correct part. Even with the 2-3 business dday shipping the part was still cheaper the the stores. Got the part the other day and installed it truck runs fine. very happy.
3,3 1/2 stars,"there is a great album trying to get out here, and not quite making it. there are three alsolutely outstanding cuts on this album that make it something you should have. these are: ""Bo Diddley,"" a raw scorching rocker, with wicked guitar. ""if i were a carpenter,"" a stunning version of the tim hardin classic. and ""let it rock,"" another great raw slice of rock and roll. the 1st & 3rd of these songs appear on the wonderful ""live bullet"" album, but the versions here are more raw and powerful than the live performances, making this album a worthwhile purchase. unfortunately, the other six tracks on ""smokin' o.p.'s"" are, though enjoyable enough, not essential. so this recording has three seeds of greatness that fully flowered. the rest did not quite make it. hope that helps you decide if you want to purchase it or not."
1,awful,"Trite, boring songs with none of the classical themes that used to be in their music. The remake of Pictures was unnecessary, especially since Greg Lakes voice doesnt have the range it used to, and couldnt hit some of the notes. I threw the CD in the garbage becauese I didnt think I could get anything for it anywhere."
5,Fun!,"Great toy! All four of my girls love this toy. Durability is great. The kids somethimes even share, sitting across from each other. Lots of fun!"
3,Little Durability,"My kids have always loved the ""sit n spin"", but I purchased the one with lights and sound for my 2 1/2 yo daughter. Within a short amount of time, the underside of the ""handle"" was cracking up the side.It's a fun toy, but the durability just isn't there...unlike it's past counterpart."
3,no spinning,i don't know if i put this thing together wrong or what but only the base spins all the way around.the handle doesn't it only goes around a quater of the way so you can't spin in a complete circle unless you do it with hands on the floor and spin.i thought it was just mine but my cousin has the same problem.does any on e else.e-mail me at graham_felicia@yahoo.com.maybe that is how they are made now but when i was young you could use the handle to spin in a circle.my son still loves it though.
4,Spinning fun to music!!,"I had one of these as a child and its great to get my kids what I had!! BUT the bonus is the music!! Its a great inside day energy burner, my 3 year old loves it and my 8 year old even gave it a go!"
3,THIS THING SUCKS!!!!! DON'T BUY IT!!!!!,"This think is NOT like they used to be!! My 3 year old can sit on it and he can make the music work which he loves but for some reason he can't make it turn, he's lightweight too... Also the music doesn't have a high/low volume feature or an on/off feature, meaning that when the batteries get low it could turn on all by itself, if it's kept in your childs room that means it could wake up your child. They need to put some more work into this toy, it could be a good toy but this particular one is not!!"
4,We like this toy,"We got this for my daughter as part of her Christmas this past year at 3 years old and she loves it. My son had one of the old ones...we liked it too, but it did not have the lights and sounds. It is very durable too. I think it is a good choice."
3,Sit and Spin Owner,This toy is lots of fun with the lights and music. However it is very difficult for my two year old son to use. It takes a LOT of coordination that he just doesn't have. Hopefully when he gets older he will still find it fun and be able to use it then.
2,No Win on this Sit 'n Spin,"This toy actually has gotten a ""thumbs down"" by the Oppenheim Toys Portfolio (that just cracks me up). The music is a little too loud; it just doesn't have that awesome spin action that I remember as a kid. Seems pretty tough. We got it for free- if you are in the market for one, I would pursue other alternatives."
4,Good Choice,"I purchased this for Xmas and my girls both love it. They are 1 and 4. The 1 year old likes to play the music over and over, while the 4 year old likes to spin. This was a very good purchase!"
3,Be Aware,"My two girls love it. They received it as a gift. But be aware, there are no on/off switch for the music, no volume control. It's pretty loud, and gets to be pretty annoying."
4,Happy,My 2 year old likes this toy and figured it out in no time. We decided not to put batteries in it so it is quiet. We have enough mechanical music noise in our house. Since he never knew it was supposed to play tunes he doesn't care and like the toy anyway.
5,musical sit & spin,"I bought this toy for our daughter's first Christmas, and she figured out how to use it within seconds. She loves all the different songs that play on it while spinning around. She is now three years old, and I don't think there's a day that goes by that she doesn't ride on this toy. It was a good muscle, and coordination builder for her. Her four year old brother loves to use it also, and they sometimes fight over it. I recommend this toy for rainy days. It keeps them busy for hours. It's also very sturdy, so it can be used for many more years."
5,Hours of Fun,"My two year old son got this as a gift for his birthday and he LOVES it. He'll spin until he can't see straight! He'll dance to the music and he likes to stand and spin on it all day long. BY FAR this is the BEST large toy in my house, one we will be keeping around for awhile!"
4,PERFECT FIT,"I BROUGHT THIS MOTORT THINKING IT WILL BE JUNK BUT BOY I WAS WRONG ,THIS MOTOR WAS EASY TO HOOK UP AND IT WORKS GOOD ONLY REASON I DIDNOT GIVE THIS A FIVE STAR RATING IS IT SHOULD COME WITH SCREWS OTHER THAN THAT THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT I HIGHLY RECOMEN THIS MOTOR"
5,"Classic Can ""pop"" songs","One of the best, ""sing swan song"" is only rivalled by ""Mary"" in terms of the finest Can rock or pop song, just beautiful stuff, Damo's vocal melody is just so haunting and incredible, I have no idea what 90 percent of the vocals say (and does anybody?) but I can still sing along with them, I can't stop myself even I wanted to. Spoon and Vitamin C are the other standout tracks here,but like all the first five Can records there isn't one second of wasted sound on this disk. No true lover of music can exist without this one."
2,"Good for a collection, bad if it is the only anime you own.","... This show has little in the view of a story and that fact that it is episodical makes it difficult for me to empathize with the main character whom I do not know because of a lack of background.This show sticks to a strict formula. The main guy gets a new Job, meets a ...chick, enchants her until she gets hot for him, leaves job and never scores (probably a good thing).I think horney guys are funny. I love Urusei Yatsura, but this show didn't do it for me and frankly the nipples in the first episode disturbed me. This is not one for the kiddies and not smart enough for the grownups.I give this 5 stars for dippy teenage fun.For me this Anime is right on level with Ruroni Kenshin, Kite, Cowboy Bebop, Dominion Tank Police and Green legend Ran. It is a copy of better, more original Anime."
4,THIS IS A GREAT BOOK!,"Marvin is a kid who tries to do what is right, but somehow his actions get him into trouble! He likes a girl at school and tries to stay away from the school bully. He makes promises and then cannot keep them. He tells a lie that grows and grows!"
2,1080 sucks on my sony 40inch with the VGA,"I should have listened to the reviewer who said the colors suck. couldn't even see a resolution difference, the only thing i think that is worthwhile is the price. if you haven't shelled out on a hdtv television and want to use a computer monitor, this is the default way to go. not really worth playing the xbox in non hdtv resolution in my opinion and 720 is really good enough."
5,Great Product At A Great Price,Works great on my 17inch non-widescreen monitor. Would definitely recommend others picking it up from Amazon as their price is hard to beat.
4,Xbox 360 Vga Cable,Cable works great but the audio and video componants could have been extended from each other a little more. If your video source is far away from your audio source you may need to make some adjustments like i did.
5,"Cable is great, plus the bonuses","I was pleasantly surprised to find that along with the VGA cable they included and RCA-to-headphone adapter so you don't have to go buy one. They also included a VGA male/male adapter so you can attach multiple VGA cords together if the one they give you isn't long enough.Can't go wrong purchasing the real deal from Xbox. Yeah, sometimes it's a little more expensive, but you get what you pay for."
5,Faithful Adaption to The Broadway Musical,"You are missing a great 2 hours if you do not have this exceptional film in your collection. Mr. Greenburg review (below) fails to appreciate that this film's goal was to make this viewing as close to the BROADWAY play AS POSSIBLE. The sets were deliberately made to be ""BROADWAY""-like; which is the charm of this movie. 10 stars would be given if possible.... makes me forget my woes EVERY time I watch."
2,There are better plays for women,"The publication itself is good, but the play is not! Its dated, and not Alan Ball's best. There are better scripts for women."
3,Impure Dynamite - 3.5 stars,"Pure Dynamite is an enjoyable romantic suspense novel. There's steamy, suspenseful, and interesting things happening throughout the book. While I don't think it's the worst book by any means, it's certainly not the best either. How someone who has a 'movie star' face does undercover work is beyond me, but it is fiction and it is a romance so I can get over that. For the most part I didn't feel any connection with the characters and I felt they weren't as well-drawn out as they could have been. I liked it well enough so I didn't mind that so much, because the action made up for it. The epilogue let me down though, it seemed out-of-character, a little silly and unbelievable, and way too abrupt.While I don't think it warrants all the five stars, that is those people's opinions, and mine is that it's a little above average. Still there's other romantic suspense I've enjoyed more, but it's a fine little read if you don't expect too much."
5,I love this book,"This is a wonderful book. I got it out of my local library and came into Amazon to find out how expensive it is because I intend to buy it. I have never seen this designer before and I'm very pleased with her style. The characters are happy but aren't too cartoonish. The projects that don't have ""people"" or ""bears"" in them are elegant.There are both large and small projects, and projects with and, in the case of some of the small ones, without sayings. I like the alphabets that are used. The charts look clear, and although I haven't yet tried any of them out, I think even the larger projects are relatively easy to do because there are very few half stitches. The half stitches seem to be mainly in the face areas on some, but not all, of the projects.I especially like the baby sampler, good for either a boy or girl, and the elegant wedding sampler."
3,jpanese girl bodyguard,"I bought this one for the beautiful cover artwork. And in that it was satsfying, but the film itself is definitely Japanese B movie all over !"
1,5 spice it is not,"This product is 95% cinnamon. Not a true 5 spice, which is more an equal parts blend. The cinnamon is so overpowering, it is unusable. Would NOT purchase again."
4,Powerfull Mixer...,"This mixer is much more powerful than the older one I had for years. What can you say about a mixer, 3-speeds, does the job. Besides having a strong motor it operates like my old one. The 3-speed starts off slow and can power blend cold butter without a problem. Used correctly it doesn't splatter any more than my old one. Other Reviewers have stated that the blades don't stay in the unit. Well, this mixer has a separate left and right blade. They are each slightly different and when you put them in correctly you will hear a slight click. This click is the locking mechanism. It is all explained in the instruction booklet. Time will tell if it can hold up like my trusty old one that one day just disappeared -- those kids!"
4,"Very nice, low cost hand mixer","For a 3 speed, low cost mixer, this is great. The low speed is pretty high if you want to mix dry, powdery flour with liquids - expect dust flying. I have found if I just stir a little with the mixer (off) then it helps to start the mixing procedure. Then I turn it on low and quickly stir around the bowl and it mixes up pretty fast.Make sure you put the beaters in the correct holes...the larger hole takes the beater with the extra metal ring where it clicks in the hole. Make sure you hear each beater click into place before turning on the mixer or you will lose them by flying out of the mixer. Very easy to clean without the middle stem and your batter won't stick in-between the wire and have to dig it out like old-fashioned beaters.It makes a fast task with angel food cakes, whips the egg whites up nicely. Made a pound cake and that blended smooth and lite. I would recommend this for anyone needing a fairly light weight, easy to use hand mixer."
5,"Great mixer, wonderful color","This is a great addition to my kitchen and red appliances. I needed a hand mixer for small jobs and this one is perfect. Easy to use, easy to clean and very sturdy. I expect it will last a long time, same as my other cherished Cuisinart appliances. Delivery was quick. Good experience all around."
4,Cuisinart Mixer,Sturdy little mixer with a lot of power. Best hand mixer I've ever purchased. I always buy those low end basic models. This is just a few dollars more and there's a huge difference.
2,Bootleg,"Is CD is definitely bootleg, it is VERY obvious. It has a brown hue, David hodges is spelt wrong, poor music quality and etc. But when you think about it, do you really think that the original origins would sell for $35-60!! But if you want to tae the risk go for it! I just think that it is a ripoff, it is too expensive and is a BOOTLEG for crying out loud!:("
3,Evanescence - Origin,"I received my copy yesterday,the sound quality is terrible and some parts of some songs are skipping,how can i be sure its not a bootleg????"
2,Not so sure..,"Unfortunately this router loses the connection to my cable modem quite often. I need to reboot the router for it to renew the upstream internet connection - though the downstream connection to my wireless laptop(Netgear MA401) is always excellent.Apart from that - very easy setup, great signal strength and link quality all around the house, and an excellent price.. too bad the upstream connection is so unreliable.I'll return this router tomorrow."
3,Easy? Yes Capable? Well...,"Like other users, I got this wireless router talking to both my wired MacOS G3 and wireless PC laptop (using the companion MA401 wireless PC card) within 1/2 hour. The web-based wizard served by the router worked well.However, I had to bring it home and set it up to find out there's no built-in firewall in this router. You have to rely on NAT and the wireless encryption for security. Strike one.Also, I couldn't find any documentation on the CD or NetGear's site for the unit's telnet command line interpreter, and whether it might offer more configuration options than the web-based interface. Strike two.Finally, the wireless range inside my wood and plaster house was much more limited than spec'd. Transfer rate dropped to 2Mbit when I got a couple of rooms away and disconnected in the back yard. Strike three - return to vendor."
4,Up and Running in 1 hour,"I just purchased the above unit and the corresponding Wireless PC card. The entire set up took approximately 1 hour, including installing many of the security features for the Wireless LAN.Several months ago I had purchased another unit from an un-named vendor and gave up on the installation after 8 hours over 2 days. Eventually, the unit failed and I returned it.The Netgear unit provides a focused and easy to understand set of installation steps. Their web site provided useful information about the set-up for a variety of ISPs.Throughput for the wireless LAN seems pretty good, but range is limited, but adequate. Lastly, the price is very competetive."
2,Doesnt work for most wifi requiring things,"I have this and it only works for my Wii and Dsi, but not Dsi games. I cant get it to work on my iPod touch and its very slow. On my iPod touch it says it has 3 bars but it doesnt connect. I would say you get a differrent router."
1,worthless investment,"The router portion of this device works great, and setup on a LAN is easy. However, the wireless feature fails at least 5 times per day and must be rebooted by unplugging the unit (there is no power switch). I called their technical support, and they told me to return it to the place I bought it. At least they were honest: this is a worthless investment if you want wireless capability."
5,Why don't all Doctors read this?????,I cannot understand why every single GP Doctor does not follow this book to the letter/ Why don't they? Because it's nothing to do with drugs - just good science and good nutrition - makes ALOT of sense
5,Nitric Acid vs Heart Disease,"Great book...important information. Had already read the book, but purchased it to have in my library as a reference."
3,Tedious,A laborious advertisement for a nutititional supplement. Sad because Nitric Oxide is a valuable piece of information in its own right.
2,Disappointing,"I was mislead by the other reviews of this book. Don't get me wrong, the book has it's moments, but the author is more concerned about letting the reader know how learned she is than actually writing an interesting book. There are more tangents about other works of literature and entertainment that it's easy to forget that the book is about a Rock bands lyrics. As insightful and intelligent as the lyrics are, it is still Rock music. The book should be fun. At the very least, the book should stick to the topic. I have not finished yet, but I have been skipping whole paragraphs because they simply don't apply.If you are looking for an eclectic book covering many topics, buy this book. If you are interested in Rush lyrics exclusively, this book may be hard to swallow."
4,Great DVD,"I read alot of reviews for this dvd, most talking about sound and some things not lining up, when there is singing and Blackie is not singing. That is all just bad editing, it is a live show shot from different cameras, put together by someone who isn't too bright. I am glad i bought this dvd, i have been a WASP fan for many years and i have seen them live. WASP kicks ass and they always have! Seeing them live is the best, this show could have been better but oh well. I enjoyed this concert!! Anyone who is a WASP fan should buy this!"
2,The real W.A.S.P. live experience,"I watched this DVD again now, only for the second time, after having owned it since it was released.It shows you what you can expect from a W.A.S.P.-show in the 21st century.Well, almost. This DVD obviously contains overdubs here and there, especially in the backing vocals section. Even so, the live musical quality of the band's original members is questionable.I have been at many W.A.S.P.-concerts in my time, and they simply don't sound anything like they do on their studio releases. Sad, but true.I wonder how much of their ""Live... in the raw"" album is truly live?I have always been a big fan of W.A.S.P., and I have followed them since ""The last command"" was released in 1985. Blackie Lawless is surely a talented songwriter and studio performer. But as a professional artist, he should be more focused on the musical performance when he's playing live.This DVD shows a band who seem a bit uninspired and sloppy in their performance."
2,Very flawed.,"This book is very good for what it does have, with very complete discographies. However, there is way too much emphasis on artist/groups of the 80's onward; most of those of the 50's and 60's (except for some of the heavyweights) are not even mentioned. May I respectfully request the authors to do another volume of rock and rollers, well known and otherwise, from 1945 to 1970?"
2,Slightly Peevish,"I find this music annoying. It does work for bedtime, but I find it very hard to listen too. There must be better lullaby music out there that soothes parent and child."
2,Just a beginning,This romantic story of two sailors on leave at times made me smile and other times made me wince a little. I think the book has some good elements and I see there's a sequel and I'd be curious to read that. The writing varies in too many places.
1,TOO EXPENSIVE,"It is to expensive, between the price you pay for it and the s/h charges it is double than the price you can pay to the regular market."
1,Don't buy if you're a teacher,"My wife, who is a high school English teacher, ordered this to show to her classes following their study of the play. The R rating is appropriate; don't plan on showing it in its entirety. Though you could probably show a few select scenes, definitely preview (luckily she did). None of the scenes with the witches are ok to show to a class. One of the witches is a hermaphrodite who lifts skirt and shows her junk, and in another scene--the part where Macbeth goes back to the witches to get more prophecies--the play's three witches are joined by about a hundred nasty naked old witches--gross. Also, the fighting scenes are super cheesy. Actually, the whole thing is pretty cheesy. Not worth the money for you hard-working teachers."
3,Macbeth!!,"so umm, this movie was.... Interesting, the acting was unique, and the fighting, well thats beond words! the witches were kinda nasty but something that u would expect because of the Play Boy production. i love how the dagger was floating it was amazing, it blew my mind. Thanks For Your Time!"
2,Macbeth,Overall i thougth that the movie was decent. Considering the movie was made in the 70's it was poorly put together and i felt that some of the scens ruined my images form actual play macbeth. the final fight scen was not very good in the book it was potrayed as very powerful proud fight but in the movie the fight was chessy and not very powerfull i mean people where kicking eachother that is not the way a huge fighty should be. However i liked how the movie mad ross the thired murderer It was a very good idea that just seemd to fit and i also liked how in the final scen Donaild Bain whent to see the witchs it tied history in nicly and left the ending a littel more open and i liked that. Over all the movie was not really my idea of a great movie but those of you who are into old movies with fighting and gore its probably a good movie for you.
4,Great Adaptation,"Polanski's adaptation of Shakespere's great play is a masterpiece in film. Polanski follows the basic theme and plot of the play but emphasizes more on the murderous madness of MacBeth and his devious wife.Polanski focuses a substantial amount of time on the gruesome murder of King Duncan. The scene succeeds in showing how MacBeth's mind is overtaken by madness and how pointless his crime really is. The scene with the witches also adds an element of the occult: emphasizing how credulence and superstition lead to foul thoughts and deeds. Taking into account that the film was done shortly after the Manson killings, one can see some parrallels with Polanski's adaptation.I find this film to be one of the finest (but not most faithful) adaptations to one of the bard's most somber plays."
3,"dark, dark, dark, dark","Will's play is pretty good. Polanski's film, not so much. Yep, the Scottish play was meant to be a dark one, and Polanski gives us lots of glowering skies, but I just didn't feel much depth of character in this rendering. I'd love to see what Zefferelli would do with Macbeth... or the Cohen brothers...."
4,Mr. Yochum's Senior English Class,"Being a bit of a film fanatic, I was expecting from Polanski an excellently directed interpretation of Shakespeare's classic tragedy. Fortunately, this famous director fully delivered. Besides the success of direction, I also believe that the cinematography, location, and art direction were very well done.All in all, I thought this film was a generally captivating version of the play, but I believe there was an occasional scene that was in need of an editing eye. Shakepeare's classic soliloquies are obviously acceptable in the plays themselves, but if given the opportunity to portray emotions more clearly through cinema, I think the writers or director should have taken more advantage of the chance.I would definitely recommend this film to any Shakespeare, Polanski, or just basic retro film fans. (not to mention 12 grade english classes)"
4,not just for the older generations,"Ok so about a month ago I purchased this CD for my grandma not realizing that most likely I would have to endure hearing it all the time as well. I knew she was bound to love it however, what I was not expecting was for me to love it almost as much. The songs on it are all of really good quality and although some of them at first I did not know any of the words to, I know find myself voluntarily singing along. Definitely recommend this album to others!"
4,Very nice overview,"This is a big, fun, overview of women cartoonists from about 1895 to now. It would make a great gift. Lots of full-color reproductions of the work and some quotes from the artists make this a great introduction for anyone interested in women artists. That being said, it is really kind of a ""coffee table"" book in that the text is secondary. There is no analysis, just a chronological introduction of each artist, and the nature of the book requires that the author can only briefly mention incredibly important cartoonists like Alison Bechdel in a sentence, or not even mention Roz Chast at all. Still, you can't do everything in one book, and some people would not be interested in heavy reading. This book should serve as an excellent appetizer for those who will seek out more about these talented women, and to check out more writing by Trina Robbins."
4,One gutsy chick!,"I mostly bought this album for the song ""Change the World"" because I love the inspirational lyrics. I also love ""Riddles"". The lyrics to taht song are so true!! ""Change the World"" is one of my favourite songs ever!Musically, it isn't what you'd call ""classic"" Joan Jett. I know people have compared to albums like ""Fetish"" and ""Naked"" which I haven't personally heard, but what I am saying is that it's different from her early stuff anyway.The lyrics to many of her songs are interesting. ""Change the World"" is so challenging. Along with being catchy, ""Riddles"" has a great point. I love the hard punk style of ""Five"", even though I'm not a huge punk fan.Overall, good album."
2,"some interesting remakes, others ruin the classic","While some of the songs are innovative renditions of songs I have loved for many years, others incorporated singers who sounded like English was a second language. I thought this would be a new and interesting take on the original but I guess you simply cannot improve on this classic. Stick to the original!"
1,Awful...Just AWFUL!,"I was really excited to get this CD, being such a fan of everything Charlie Brown and Vince Guaraldi. But, all this CD did was make me want to go find the ""Happy Anniversary Charlie Brown"" CD and listen to it, instead!I'm not sure what the producers were thinking about when they were developing this drek, but it clearly was not Charlie Brown OR Christmas. It is the swishiest-cheesiest-smoothjazziest-elevatoriest piece of junk and I'm appalled they were willing to let it out of the studio."
2,Controller,"The first controller was defective. The second controller worked fine for a little over a month but the right thumbstick eventually became defective. It moves on its own at times, and simply straightening the thumbstick doesnt fix the problem. It doesnt always do this but I also noticed that the thumbstick has become harder to move, the sensitivity is greatly affected by this. I have a feeling that the thumbstick will eventually just break. Im going to try and get it replaced but im not sure if Amazon will replace it without a fee since it has been a little over 30 days. The microsoft warranty is 90 days though so I dont see why they wouldn't be able to."
1,"The Final Score is STATIC: 1, MICROSOFT: 0","Microsoft needs to harden the equipment they sell against electrical discharge. I got this controller two months ago, and a minor poke of static electricity fried it! It no longer functions in any useful way, except as a $30 paperweight."
2,Expected the real thing.,"I was hoping to get a real Xbox 360 controller and from th outside, that's why it was. When I first tried it out, the buttons were little softer than I had hoped and I didn't always know if I was hitting them. As I continued to play, it was clear there were more problems. All the buttons did the desired function but it felt different than my other controller so I took a peak inside. What i saw was terrible. One of the rubble packs was disconnected and the chip had saunter burns everywhere. I thought I could fix the rubble by plugging it in but then I saw the the connector was missing so that was that. I will be trying to return this look alike and recommend that you avoid buying this.Don't fall for the scam like I did."
4,Doesn't Feel The Same Still Great,"I owned the wireless 360 controller and it starting to wear out so I decided to get a wired controller and avoid the hassle of changing and charging batteries. It works the same as the wireless controller but feels different in your hands. If you have never used the wireless before, I don't think this would affect you in the least. The wired controller is a little lighter and the wire tends to drape over or around my finger on the right trigger button. These are really only small issues, its a great controller but I do prefer the wireless version.EDITA week later and it feels better in my hand. The cord draping over my trigger finger still bugs."
5,My favorite gamepad,"This is the best gamepad to use with a PC in my opinion. It's plug and play, comfortable to hold and many games are programmed to work with it out of the box. It's analog sticks are good enough to use for flight sim type games, and the triggers have enough range of motion to make great gas and brake inputs for racing games. It is also great for platformers and fighting games, which never really feel right played with a keyboard/mouse."
5,Husband pleased.,"Bought it, plugged it in, set it up, played. He gets a kick out of the vibrating when he's getting pummeled by the enemy."
2,buttons stick and does not work well.,The buttons on the color pad stick and it looks like the controller has been taken apart. It was not worth the money and wish i never ordered it
4,Amen - - Amen - -Amen.....,"Yet ANOTHER GREAT DVD, that Ringo is in. The case is a little misleading, as not everybody pictured actually perform. However this is STILL a must have. George Harrison does several, including one of Carl's that Carl forgot all the words to. Carl still looks good, plays good, sings good, and still has that ""good-old-boy"" persona. The end of this disk made me get a little weepy-eyed. This is a piece of history, along with Roy Orbison's Black and White Night, and Ringo's All Star Band."
5,A reminder that music is supposed to be fun!,"This was a made-for-TV concert performed in England in 1985. I dare anybody to keep their feet still while watching this.Carl Perkins was celebrating the 30th anniversary of his song ""Blue Suede Shoes"", and was a master showman here. He sang and played with an infectious enthusiasm that visibly inspired his famous guests.Highlights include Perkins, Ringo Starr, and Eric Clapton sharing verses of ""Matchbox"", a blazing guitar solo by Clapton on ""Mean Woman Blues"", a humorous and impressive demontration by Perkins on how to create a fake reverb effect with a picking technique, and a wild and wooly group singalong with all the guest stars.But maybe best of all was Perkins luring George Harrison out of retirement. The show ends with a moving thank-you from Perkins to his friends and the fans. What a concept, acknowledging and thanking the fans!This video is tremendous fun with some rock legends. I recommend it as highly as any music video I've ever seen."
4,A classic Japanese Anime worth watching!,"This movie is packed! For the rating of PG-13 [maybe will change??] well, that's a weird rating. This movie is loaded with adult animation. Though I am 14 myself, I do not find this movie offensive. There is some sex involved, but nothing to graphic, about the same you'd see in an American R movie. The adult content is extremely high, though. The story is about a young girl, at 16 she is filled with preasure from peers to have sex, even her mother pressures her. But the young girl, known as Yohko, wants to wait for the right time. Her pureness pays off, for as she remains pure in body and mind, she becomes closer to her fate, to become the 108th generation of Devil Hunter! This is a great movie that I recommend watching at least once. Violence and sex not your taste? No problem! This movie is also filled with ""sick"" comedy! Watch a grandma and her daughter duke it out as they argue over breakfast! If you haven't seen it, you want to!"
5,Simple Things (by Carole King),"I have been looking for this ""album"" in CD for years now. Was sure excited to see it here! Thanks!!!!"
2,Poor scholarship,"Interpret this as you will, but this book does not take a scientific approach to the study of stress, preferring to rely on ancient medicine and holistic body-mind-spirit ideas.Unfortunately, the author not only departs from scientific fact, but also from common-sense scientific methodology. Evidence for ""cell memory"" is an unverified story of an unnamed woman who had cravings for beer and chicken nuggets after recieving a heart transplant from a motorcyclist. Einstein proved that E=mc^2; even scientists admit the universe is a friendly place made of spiritual energy! These statements reflect poor understanding and scholarship by the author and turn an interesting, harmless book on holistic health into an embarassing lesson on what happens when you believe everything you hear."
1,They never sent it.,"I needed this book for school, they said they would send out by monday, that was 2 weeks ago. I have tried to contact them and i have heard nothing. Very unreliable!"
2,Very poor action movie,"I bought this DVD because it was a bargain and because of the review I read about it.But I did not enjoy it much. The story is poor, even the action scenes are not that great.It is, in my opinion, a poor imitation of another great movie of the genre: ""Firefox"", with Clint Eastwood, which I really recommend.If you want an action movie and don't bother about the plot this is a good and cheap choice."
5,ADORABLE,"This is one of the sweetest christmas movies! Even as a college student, I still enjoy going home and watching it with my family! It will be a classic for any age!"
3,Disappointed,"I purchased this movie; as well as, ""Eloise at the Plaza."" They were both unopened so I assume they were brand new. (They were supposed to be). However, both movies skip in several spots. The vendor that sold them to me did offer for me to send them back and they would re-ship me a new one. That is not what I expect to have to do when I purchase a new item. I sincerely hope that no one else has to go through this. This was my first time purchasing from amazon and frankly, I'm not real sure I will again! How incredibly disappointing.I am giving the item a good rating simply because I do like the movie....my niece absolutely adores it. Eloise captivates her."
4,Fascinating!,This was a charming romance as well as an interesting mystery. I definetly recommend this book and hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
1,Completely Unreliable,"I got one of these as a wedding present, but I had a reliable Oster blender so I shelved it. My Oster gave out after 3-4 years, and I fired this one up. It was very powerful, but it made a burning smell whenever I used it. Then a ring appeared around the base which was oil being thrown out from the blade assembly just under the jar bottom. After less than one month of use, liquid started to leak through the blade assembly onto the base. I recommend avoiding this."
3,multitester,"The product, purchased from amazon.com, is adequate for most amateur work. It is not a heave duty product and is for general light work. Exact readings are close, but not precise. It's good for keeping around the house or office for emergency electrical testing."
1,Horrible audio quality prvents form ejoying the music,"Well, I got accustomed to the low quality of ""Visual Artists International"" videos, and would not have bought this one, if only I could get another Anna Moffo video recording of a complete opera. But what I heard here is simply below any reasonable quality standard. High notes are distorted, orchestra voices are not heard at all, everything is messed up. When they sing or play loudly and high, you just have to shut your ears. Many old archived non-restored recordings are of better quality than this one. Total waste of money."
1,Never received the video,I never received this product. Was sent a note that it was undeliverable because they did not have the correct address. That was a falsehood since the correct address was on the note I received. I was told the charge would be taken off my account. I trust that it was. I have not ordered anything lately.
3,NOT AS ADVERTISED,"A quite good IDE (ATA) enclosure but will not accomodate SATA. The description doesn't state this clearly and the ""purchased with"" recommendation pairs it with a SATA drive. I did load a ATA drive and the product worked very well, looks quite good, etc. Probably a very good purchase if your needs are limited to ATA."
5,Totally pleased with this product,"Clean Eau de Toilettes, Original, 2.14 - Fluid Ounce came just as hoped and expected.I am completely pleased with the product and absolutely pleased with the distributor.Additionally, the product arrived in a timely manner as promised by the distributor."
4,Smells great...doesn't last long though.,"I would give the scent of this perfume 5 stars, but I marked it down to 4 stars simply because the scent doesn't last very long. It smells so nice when I first put it on the morning...clean, crisp, and fresh. However, the scent seems to fade pretty quickly...may be partially because this is just the eau de toilette, which isn't as strong as the ""real stuff""."
1,Make sure you purchase the battery - SOLD SEPERATELY,"I purchased the Tyco Tony Hawk RC in early November for my son for Christmas. NOT INCLUDED was the recharagable battery pack, something that needed to be purchased separately. NO WHERE in the description of the item was this noted, so on Christmas morning, we found a gift which we could not use. I had plenty of time to purchase this if I had known - but did not. I count on Amazon.com to let me know what the package requirements are. This should have been an automatic linked purchase that needs to be refused rather than discovered well after the purchase."
1,Cheap shot,"Why would anyone sell a toy that you can't use unless you buy a seperate battery pack? What good is the toy without the (just as expensive) battery pack? This is marketing at its worst! If you can't use it without the battery pack, why wouldn't they include it?!"
1,Deceptive and disappointing,"What a disappointment for my 2 grandsons when on Christmas Eve they were allowed to open just one present each.They chose to open the gifts from their grandfather and me, They could not work the toys as there needed to be a POWER PACK ? of some sort to make it work. This was DEFINATELY not clear to me when I ordered the items. The boys tried to make usnot feel bad but it was embarrassing and a real let down. Now we are running all over trying to find these PACKS and they can't be found !!!!! And buying these additional parts makes it more expensive then we planned...that is IF we can find them. What do we do with these worthless pieces of junk NOW ???"
5,The toy of the year,This toy is very fun for kids 8+. It also may go very fast so... I recommend this toy for you child.
1,Diana Ross Live - The Lady sings>>>,"Quality concert average, Quality off the DVD very badYou paid for new and they send you a second hand DVD who spring every half hour back to a earlier part of the concert. very irritant!!! Last time I buy somethingby Amazon.com!!!!"
3,Smells Like Someone Copied...,"Ok, this EP was okay. I didn't like the ""Smells LIke Teen Spirit"" version that she did. If you are a Tori Amos fan and you want to hear some other covers and renditions of male artists and musicians, you'll enjoy ""Strange Little Girls"" instead."
4,BASICS...AND THEN SOME,"I only gave this book a 4 out of 5 stars b/c it has alot of basics that we as parents already know (or most of us do!) Overall, it's a fun read and has fun activity pages in the back - I'm glad I have it, but I've seen better :o)"
1,Road to Avonlea -The complete fourth volume,"I was sent two (2) Disc #3's and NO Disc #4. I truly love the series and would like for you to send me Disc #4 of the Fourth Volume of ""Road to Avonlea."" Please send instructions on how I am to return the extra Disc #3. Thank you."
5,It really isn't about incest,"Everyone seems to think this movie is about incest. Technically, there is some incest in the film, but isn't it really just about sexuality??Two young guys who are in the music industry are not going to be normal people. Their lives are so different from everyone else. Their sexuality is different as well. Overall, both Harry and Max are lost souls looking to grab onto to something or someone good.And when your life is as strange as theirs is, I guess you might consider grabbing onto the one person--the only person--you think you truly know and trust--your brother."
1,One of the Worst Hiking Guides I've Ever Read,"This is one of the worst hiking guides I've ever read. The text is nothing but how to get from point A to point B, but even the skeleton descriptions are difficult to follow, as the text often refers to roads, trails and markers not found on the map. The maps typically relate to 2-3 hikes, but the hikes are not even numbered on the maps so it is not easy to figure out what the text descriptions are referring to."
4,Jolly Romp,"The most unfortunate aspect of this video is that it is sung in English and looses some of its charm in the process. Luckily, Beverly Sills has enough charm to more than make up for the English translation. She may not be quite as firm or sweet of voice as she used to be, but she sails through the scales, trills and breathtaking flights of coloratura like it were as easy as falling off a log!The rest of the cast is more than adequate, with Tonio singing all of his customary high C's.Sulpice and Countess are excellent as well!All in all, a great performance. You can get Beverly Sills singing this opera in French on the Opera 'oro label. She in even better voice and it's in the original language."
1,WARNING!,"Although the picture shows the uprights that you attach to the wall, it does not come with them and you cannot order them, so this was useless for my needs. Had to send both of them back."
3,I was mistaken,"I thought this was a stand-alone item, but it needed the wall strips (to fasten it to the wall), so it took a trip to home depot to get more supplies before it could be installed."
5,Hunters of the Dusk,When i read the first book in the cirque due freak series i was hooked. i read the other books about three times in a row before i was satisfyed that i read them thoroughley. I love these books and You will too.
3,Sum 41 dvd,You like Sum 41 you'll like this is has alot of their videos i think maybe all. Some never seen footage of kids being kids funny goofy stuff If you had siblings well mainly brothers i guess you can relate pranks jokes goofing around videos to sum 41 music really great. If your a fan you can't go wrong buying this.
1,NEVER order this...it will never come,"I ordered this in October 2005...after months and months of updating my order and waiting and waiting for shipment, I finally cancelled it. It the site says there are some in stock, you would think it could ship, but none the less..it doesn't. Don't order this or you will be waiting forever and a day."
3,A good addition to a Nazareth collection,"Looking at the set list of this CD - you should be giving this double album 5 stars. Especially the second CD covers tracks from the (up until now) not documented period of the 2XS and Sound Elixier tours. However, the overall sound quality of these live tracks is not all that great. As mentioned in the booklet, these are 'sound board' recordings and obviously, there has not been any mastering. It is great to hear all these live recordings, but if you are not a Nazareth collector, buy 'Snaz (their live double album from the 'Fool Circle' tour) instead."
4,The size and content arrangement are great,"I'm still learning Slovak and found this very helpful while travelling there a few months ago. The font is totally outdated... I searched high and low for a good Slovak book -- they are really hard to find. The slim size of this one makes it super easy to carry and the way the topics are grouped (food, transportation, etc.) made it really easy to find what I was looking for in a second. I think it's totally useful if you're learning and especially if you're visiting Slovakia. (Which, by the way, is a true hidden gem in Europe.)"
1,Buyer Beware,"This product was very disappointing. The major fragrance is that of old fashion cold cream. The lilac fragrance is intermittent. What the other frangrance is remains undetermined. The cost was beyond outrageous when you factor in the shipping charges. $17.00 is too much for this 8 ounce questionable body cream. This is a ""buyer beware"" review."
2,Not Too Effective,"Delivery was fine and on time.Unfortunately, it really didn't do a good job the 1st time, a second application was tried. The carpet to which the product was applied is old and possibly not the best selection for a test, Even with 2 applications, the traffic area was not really clean."
5,The master,This edition to me is great.I know the sound is in mono and the dubbing isn`t that good but guys look how old the film is.Bruce`s best films were to my concern Return of the Dragon and Chinese Connection
5,ONE OF A KIND,ENTER THE DRAGON IS THE BEST MOVIE YOU WILL EVER SEE MY ADVICE WOULD BE TO BUY IT NOW BEFORE I GET THEM ALL IT IS AMAZING. NOT JUST THE FANTASTIC MARTIAL ARTS FIGHT SCEANES BUT THE GRIPPING STORY AS WELL.
5,Great product,Amazon has great customer service. The Bruce Lee Collection was new- still in its original packaging and still at a great price.
1,Book Falls Short,"Among the books I have read about teambuilding, this is not one of the better ones. If an organization is seriously considering moving to a self-directed work team environment, I can see this book being helpful. However, for those who are simply reading the book to expand your own knowledge base, you will most likely find that you will learn little. This book contains little more than common sense solutions that can be reached without investing the time and pain necessary to read the entire book. Anybody with an education in management and/or experience in the management field will gain little from this read."
4,Lost in Blue is worth the money,This game is worth the money. It provides hours and hours of entertainment. Try it.
4,This game is the king of all gamez!!!!!,"This game is extremely awesome! No cheats, but a few glitches here and there, not extremely hard, not too simple. If U R getting a game for someone, U should get this game."
3,Not bad,"I saw this in the theater when it first came out. I often like see things twice to catch anything I may have missed particularly when subtitles are involved. I enjoyed it tremendously with the first viewing--found the secondary characters highly engaging, and the humorous aspects of the story delightful.The framing device worked fairly well and excused some of the smarmier aspects of the love story as well as the interrogation--as merely memory, but overall I found the storyline a bit slick, though certainly far more mature than anything Hollywood is capable of producing. Additionally, the two leads were charming."
5,"Amazing product, great deal too!","This wrap-around braided sleeve is excellent for organizing wires behind your computer, entertainment center, office, etc... has a whole lot of uses that I could mention for days.As for the price on Amazon, can't get any better. 25ft for $[...] is a REAL bargain. If you were to go to other reputable cable organizing sites such as [...], you'll easily pay $[...] if not more for this many feet...its the identical product from the same company.My advice, don't even think about comparing this to other wire organizing tubes or sleeves, it really beats everything out there!"
4,Somewhat expensive but worth it for certain applications,"I used this sleeving product to consolidate numerous audio and video cables emerging from the back of a wall mount LCD monitor. Worked very well. Now I have one big black snake drapped down the side of the mantle vs. individual cabling. My only alternative would have been a lot of holes in drywall to pull the cable through, so this was far less labor intensive.If you contemplate a similar application, use enough cable & sleeving to allow the wall mount monitor to be removed and placed on the floor or furniture - you may want to add/change the cabling configuration, and you'll need room to work unless you have a swing-out style mount."
4,Bigger than you might think,"I have two monitors with 6 cables running down across my desk down to the tower. The 1"" size holds a LOT of cabling. These 6 cables (power, usb & dvi) loosely fit in this size. I should have probably gotten the 1/2 or 3/4 inch size. The 1/4 would have been far too small."
1,TERRIBLE,I live in an old house and I can not get the alarm to shut off. It was a waste of money. Buy a different product
2,nozzle review,"I expected this nozzle to produce a powerful water stream for floor cleaning..while it does produce a good spray, it is no better than any other run of the mill trigger handle sprayer. The on/off control works very well and its small size is handy."
4,Good display piece.,"Buffy doll looks pretty good. The hands do not hold on to the weapons very well, and the stand does not have any pegs or anything to help hold Buffy in place. You just have to set her up just right so she stands by herself. Mostly meant to be a display piece I think."
1,Horrible,"BEWARE. Amazon must be selling defective tape at this price. It has almost no stick to it. I used it to seal a package, left it over night and by morning the tape had all popped off. Really strange."
1,Non stick tapes!!!,"I hope I should read the 1-star comments before I placed my order. The tapes are totally non-stick. To my surprised, the early negative comments was from January of the last year! What did they do for the entire year. Did they just continue make the non-stick tapes? Or they just try to sell all the returned ones to some stupid guys like me? I will give this product five negative stars if I can. Will return it immediately."
1,junk - wont stick - worst tape ever,"I bought this about 3 months back and since then every one of them have no stickiness in it, it is hard to package anything with it."
1,Scotch Packing Tape,I ordered this tape because we had shipping to do today. I opened it up and guess what - no sticky on the tape. You couldn't tape a piece of toilet paper together with this tape!!! Bad buy.
2,Glue must have been a bad batch. : (,I love the thickness of the tape but the adhesive is sub-standard. It is almost worthless. This product is so bad I am compelled to write my first review of a product. Unfortunately it isn't to praise it. I have used this product before (purchased individually at a store) and loved it; that's why I bought 6 rolls at one time. I am disappointed.
3,Weak Adhesive: Does Not Stick Well,"The dispenser is good, tape is thick and strong but the it does not stick very well. The adhesive is weak.The competitors likeLePage's USPS All Purpose Packaging Tape, 2 inches x 110 yards , 6 Pack (82302)andDuck Brand HP260 High Performance Grade Packaging Tape, 1.88"" x 60 Yards, 3.1 Mil, Crystal Clear, 6-Pack + 2 Bonus Rolls (1067839)do not have this nice a dispenser but they stick a lot better."
1,NOT STICKING TO PACKAGES!!!!!,I purchased a 6 pack of these and it simply is NOT sticking to the boxes. It won't even stick to a piece of paper!!! What is going on? I have purchased these for years now and this box simply is horrible. Will NOT purchase anymore!!
4,Good thick tape.,"This does just what it is supposed to do. I use it for mailing items, keeping boxes closed, and repairing the books I like to read over and over again. I find it less frustrating than most because its thickness means it's not going to disappear on the roll if you forget to fold a corner down. It is also quite able to stand up to moisture, though not at the level of duct tape. This gives some piece of mind when mailing large envelopes.My dad happens to use this tape when he paints windows. He will wear a cotton undershirt, stick a strip of tape to it, and then apply the slightly lint-filled tape on the window's edge. The tape is more rigid and much easier/quicker to apply than masking tape, but way too sticky without the lint to lessen the adhesive. If paint gets under the tape's edge, he presses the tape onto the paint and it peels right off."
1,This Heavy Duty Tape Does Not Stick,This tape labelled heavy duty has no adhesive on it. I ordered it and did not use it for a month and could not return it. Every roll was bad. Don't buy it. Just get the regular Scotch Packaging tape. It works much better.
5,great tape!,"Works really well for its purpose- packaging tape. I will buy again when I run out of it, good set and good value"
4,High Quality Tape,"High quality shipping tape.The 2"" width is good for small business type packes ( 12x12 Boxes MAX.)Larger size boxes would need a wider than 2"" width."
1,Does Not Stick,"Very disappointed in this tape. Have used this type of tape for years, and for some reason, this last batch I bought just does not stick to the boxes. So frustrating."
3,So so....,"Ok is the word for this dvd....its definately supertramp at their best back in the day...so that being said the video quality isnt that spectacular, sound is decent for how old the video is...if you love supertramp then go for it..if you just like a few songs and want high quality dvd then definately not."
4,Great Concert,"The quality of this concert is excellent for 1983. For the 1000th time, do not make comments like the following one regarding concerts that were filmed before current digital technology was invented: ""Maybe, I would consider playing it on my laptop, at the airport to kill time, but certainly not on my digital surround system with a progressive scan DVD, on my HDTV. Playing this DVD on a state of the art system is a waste of remote control"". Why do morons keep making comments like this? I would like to hear this person's pinhead comments about Monterey Pop, Woodstock, Gimme Shelter, Yessongs, Isle of Wight Festival, any Jimi Hendrix concert, Bob Dylan's Don't Look Back, Paul McCartney's Rockshow or the Last Waltz. They were all filmed YEARS before digital technology, so I guess they suck, too? Please, when you review older concerts, review them for the PERFORMANCE."
4,Disarming passion...,"With the disarming passion of a neophyte (but withoutleaving her own faith behind), Howe plunges into therich world of traditional Judaism, emerging withjewels from which all of us can profit: a profoundsense of God's holiness, an insatiable hunger for andlove of God's Word, and an understanding of theimportance of ritual and community. Howe's friendshipwith the Jewish people and her deep spiritualexperiences amidst them bring a whole new dimension toher Christian faith, and her winsome story encouragesthose of us who have yet to embrace our Jewish rootsto enrich our journey by crossing the cultural and emotional barriers that so often separate us from our spiritual kin.Kristyn Komarnicki, editor of PRISM Magazine (Evangelicals for Social Action)"
3,Not Quite There,"Governor Whitmans's book offers a challange to moderate republicans to regain control of the party. Unfortunately she doen't go far enough with the specifics as how to accomplish this. In attacking the ""social fundimentalist"" she must have been aware that she was signing her own poliical death warrant. Having said this, I question whether her ""not tell all"" book was completely honest with the events that happened while she was EPA Administrator."
2,This Battle Packs No Punch,"OK, I really wanted to like this book. I too, share Whitman's frustration at seeing my party overtaken by the extremist wing. So I expected to read a war plan outlining strategies to achieve a more balanced centrist party. What a disappointment. This book is more memoir than politcal stategy roadmap. And Whitman's constant admissions that she was ""taken aback, ""stunned and shocked"" at reactions from political opponents only serves to demonstrate how naive she is and undermines her political gravitas. The droning on and on about the environment put me to sleep, her assertion that the GOP must reach out to miniorites was quite ""shocking"" to me. Christie, tell me something I don't know. I learned little, if anything, from this book and I do not recommend it."
3,Recommended age should be lower,"I bought this for my 3 year old daughter. She already knows all of the things that this book tries to teach, and it is way too easy for a 3 or 4 year old child. If your child already knows the basics, like colors and shapes, this book will not have much educational value."
2,most leap pad books are not in good age appropriate categories,"just my opinion; but i have a hard time finding books to go with my 3yr old daughter's first leap pad. she loves maurice sendak's where the wild things are and she loves many of the other books that go with the leap pad that is for 6mo-24mo age range. i think they should have done a bit more research on which stories were associated with which leap pad system. as for the pooh bear game; i agree; way too easy here; this would have been perfect for the leap pad made for younger children, and made a more challenging one for this level. great idea; just not well put together."
2,This is thinking?,"I picked this book out with hope, as I had problems with Dennet and Penrose's books on the field. Unfortunately, Searle clearly lacks understanding of either of their main points, and his essential objections to both are mutually contradictory.Case in point: one objection to Penrose was that simulations of neural phenomena could clearly avoid the essential limitations Penrose proposes for algorithmic processes. That is idiotic on its face (how is a simulation any different from other sorts of programs?) Similar inconsistencies and plague his other writings.This is not serious thought, or indeed writing worthy of republication. I hoped to see writng backed by logical thought and consistency. Instead I found mostly semantic objections that attempt to conceal a deep lack of anything useful to say."
3,My first and last,"This was my first digital camera and I loved it. There were a few issues.Any problem with battery life can be solved with rechargable batteries which feed the camera 4x as longer then regular batteries.A few of my friends commented that it was hard to focus, but once you get used to teh camera it gets easier.Kida of a bulky thing. But it worked for me for two years.I wouldn't buy another HP camera because now there are comera that are loads better then this one here, but I will always remain fond of this one!"
1,Completely AWFUL,"For Christmas I asked for a digital camera. Since my family goes with the ""you can open one before Christmas"", I got this under the Christmas tree. I starting taking pictures, and I can't believe how poor the image quality is! I'm taking it back on the 26th (I'm sure Wal-Mart isn't open tomorrow) first thing in the morning to get a camera other than HP!"
1,***I HATE HP!!!!***,"THIS CAMERA IS THE WORST!!!I BOUGHT THIS ON BLACK FRIDAY THERE ARE MANY REASONS WHY I AM RETURNING THIS PIECE OF JUNK:1.FIRST OF ALL, IT RUNS ON DOUBLE A BATTERIES2.WHEN I CAME HOME I STARTED TAKING PICTURES.AFTER I TOOK MY FIRST PICTURE, IT SAID ERROR SAVING IMAGE!3.THEN IT WORKED AND IT DIDNT WORK.I TRIED DOWNLOADING SOME OF THE PICTURES THAT WERE ACTUALLY SAVED ON THE CAMERA ONTO THE COMPUTER.WHEN I FINISHED DOWNLOADING THEM, I LOOKED FOR THE PICS ON THE COMPUTER.I F0UND THEM BUT THE PICS WERE ALL BLURRY.I WAS SO FED UP THAT I LEFT IT SITTING ON MY COMPUTER DESK FOR THE NEXT 2 MONTHS.DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA,IT WILL BE A WASTE OF YOUR MONEY AND TIME!I ACTUALLY THOUGHT HP MADE GOOD CAMERAS.....-_-"""
2,Not as bad as what people say but still not 5 stars,"Positive:+ 3x Optical Zoom+ 1.8"" LCD+ Dock Avaliable+ Many Manual Features+ Internal Memory, But Only 16MB So Almost UselessNegative:- Very Poor Photo Quality- Very Poor Video Quality- Only Lithium Batteries IncludedThe image quality isn't as bad as what some people said, but it's still kinda poor. You probably should do some more research unless you don't mind poor photo quality."
2,Great camera... while it lasts.,"Normally I wouldnt write a review, but I have had numerous experiences with this camera that I thought I would share.My sister first bought the camera, and I was amazed with how user friendly it was and I thought the pictures turned out pretty well. Shortly afterward, her screen blacked out, without any great impact or weather damage.Naturally, I assumed it mustve gotten bumped in the wrong way, tough luck. I then proceeded to buy one for myself, and a couple of months after I had it, my screen also inexplicably failed to work.And then for Christmas, my sister received a replacement camera for her broken one, and yet again, shortly after purchase, the screen was broken.I do accept some responsibility for the damage, I imagine that if it was in a purse in a bookbag, perhaps it got rattled around a bit. But three times? I dont find this to be a coincidence, and I do not reccomend that you risk your money, because you too may have to replace it after 3 months."
5,tight dvd and cd ya'll,"man this dvd is off the heasey, it has ten tight eazy e videos, some lost footage, clips of music videos from ruthless artists like bone thugs, kokane and mc ren, the only thing they could of improved was the length of the documentary but it was still tight, if ya'll don't buy this dvd then ya'll gonna miss out on this, oh yeah tight pc game called hittin switchez is on there and its kinda challenging so its fun too, aight i'm out peace 1,"
4,It's just for you.,"This album features instrumental versions of well known Christmas songs, played on toy musical instruments. It's a cute concept, and it's well executed. The songs actually have very complex arrangements. It's not just some kid banging out ""Jingle Bells"" on a toy piano. Each songs features several instruments, expertly played by professional musicians. This is a really fun album that is sure to be enjoyed by kids and kids at heart. But it's a shame that they didn't do ""Christmas Time is Here""."
1,YIKES!!!,"This film carries a lot of the original BIGFOOT magic, but man, isit misleading. Passes as a great intro to the genre, but after that,oh, my..."
4,"Reminiscent of ""Simply Beautiful Sweaters"".....","This book is along the same lines of the popular aforementioned book that was published 4 years ago. Authors of both books are yarn store owners who have provided patterns created for their patrons. Primarily high-end and novelty yarns are used and the emphasis is on simple--no side shaping, complicated stitch patterns or colorwork. Stylish, simple to accomplish and contemporary details add flair to each sweater. The 27 patterns for women are divided by chapters into tanks, tees, pullovers, cardigans and jackets.One nice feature that is unusual in a pattern book is that each sweater is shown both on a model AND laying flat, so you get a good idea of what the sweater is like. And schematic diagrams of each sweater, so convenient if altering, are provided.All in all, a book worthy of your consideration, especially if you liked ""Simply Beautiful Sweaters""!"
2,"Good brand, lousy product","PROS: Intuitively arranged buttons. Good design.CONS: Eats batteries in less than 7 hours. Complicated file transfer software (unlike other players, which can be accessed as a hard drive letter in Windows Explorer). And worst of all... Secumax! It prevents the transfer of mp3 files from player to PC, allegedly to discourage piracy. I work around this problem by renaming the files by its initials to make it less recognizable by the software. After renaming, files may be copied to the PC. I wonder if a standalone USB media reader could bypass this protection too. Nonetheless there are other players in this price range, with similarly good build quality, which offer friendlier features."
2,Not worth the money,"I have had all of the same problems as the other reviewers, but the one that is my main complaint is the fact that the parent unit shuts down in the middle of the night for no reason when it is plugged in. This has happened to me repeatedly now and I am quite upset."
2,picture wasn't in color?,"I do like the overall design of the product but was disappointed with the picture quality, especially for $200. The menu option and zoom feature are pretty neat but the picture was very blurry and I couldn't make out any details of what was being monitored. I also thought the picture was supposed to be in color? It wasn't, even when the room was well lit? There was a delay in the audio portion but it was the overall picture that disappointed me. Another thing that I disliked was that when adjusting the volume the picture of our baby went away. Unfortunately I will be returning this product."
3,Powers off in the middle of the night even when plugged in!,"Although I can live with the limitations described by other reviewers, the fact that the parent unit shut down in the middle of the night when it was plugged in defeats the purpose of the monitor. Maybe we got a defective unit but I can't recommend this product."
1,Digital picture did not look great.,"I liked the compact design of this monitor, but unfortunately the reception was not great. I had some type of intereference every 2 minutes or so. I could see 'pixels' on the screen and in some cases over half of the screen was just blue or black when the monitor was looking for a signal (all over the house). This used to happen with digital cable when it was new I remember. When the picture did come in, the quality of it reminded me of watching a movie on the internet. Quick movements were choppy and there seemed to be a 2 second delay. That also meant when our baby cried, I heard the real cry and then heard the cry on the monitor echo 2 seconds later (and then again and again at lower volumes). It is also a little annoying that when you higher or lower the volume, the picture shuts off and has to find a signal again which takes a few seconds. Overall, I expected a much clearer picture from a monitor that uses digital technology and was this expensive."
3,Pretty Good...,"This was not one of Charlton Heston's most remembered or for that matter most enjoyed films as the critics say. Nevertheless, I woud say it has a somewhat interesting plot. This film was the one that Heston had made immediately shooting ""The Ten Commandments"" (1956). I guess he had been quite exhausted after such an arduous shoot when making ""Three Violent People"". Yet the film is not very historically accurate and the supporting actresses are played by Hollywood glamour girls such as Anne Baxter. I'm a man quite older than Mr. Heston, being eighty-seven, and I remember seeing this film in my theatre for the first time in 1957 at about age 45. I had taught history prior to this for 22 years and thought that this film only wanted to gross in money instead of following the books. Yet the effort Heston puts into this film is fine. I'm sure this picture would've been more of a success if C.H. was allowed to choose his own actors to play these parts."
4,Hackercraft,"The book is beautiful, lots of pictures and history. The book doesn't cover how to build the boats just the history of the company. Ordered from the UK and received my book in little over a week."
4,"This product was great at removing all makeup, ...","This product was great at removing all makeup, not just eye makeup. It was gentle and left my skin smooth and clean, not dry or oily. It was convenient since water isn't required. Just smooth on and wipe off with a tissue. I don't usually buy products of this type, but I liked this one."
2,Disappointing for such a talented musician,"Jude Cole is blessed with extraordinary talent - unfortunately, it doesn't appear on this record. The songs are rather non-descript and lack energy, as if Jude wrote them late at night after a long day. An unmemorable recording that sadly will eventually gather dust on my shelf. Here's to hoping that his next album sparkles much like his early material."
5,Jude is back,"Finally, another passionate record by the most underrated songwriter of our time. Maybe the layoff helped, because this music is inspired and emotional. Hope its a new beginning of many more future releases to come."
4,Big Boss Man!,"Alot of the reviews about this cd are misinformed. Jude'slatest effort is very good. I think we are about the same ageso most of the subject matter is familiar to me these days.Thoughts about my parents, mortality and defianceare themes in my life too.Cynicism about the news/entertainment media are alsoa thread that runs through this music. I think ""Leave Me Alone""is about Monica Lewinsky. This is a stipped down recordingfor Jude. It still retains his production gloss but morelike shellac than polyurethane. It's like all his other work butprobably the most personal. Anyone who likes intelligentguitar driven music will like this offering. Mike Caldwell"
5,Delivered above expectations,"I read like new in the description, but I was expecting used. Mine came with all the original stickers still on it, just without any packaging.Thanks to the seller."
3,Not bad but bad packaging,"I bought this controller used and it came in 5 days, and it came in a yellow envelope with NO plastic around the controller, just a loose controller in the envelope with a receipt. There was a little dirt in between the cracks in the LT letters but that can be cleaned. It does not come with battiers so be sure you have some when you buy this, or just plug it into a charging cord. i give it a 4/5"
5,Excellent Controller & Gaming Must-have,"I've had 4 of these since the system launched in 2005. They are all working flawlessly to this day. I would recommend the rechargeable battery packs for the wireless controller though since it does tend to go through batteries fairly fast. In addition, if you play a lot and have friends over as much as I do, you may want to consider the black wireless controller since the white model can end up getting dirty or leave spots. They are easy to clean nonetheless, I just tend to be too lazy in doing it often."
1,GARBAGE CONTROLLER,Controller was raggedy as hell dont buy from this guy...very dissapointed...THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE BOUGHT SOMETHING ON HERE AND NOT BEEN SATISFIED
3,Buy Local,I had to send this back for a refund because my 360 took a dive. It took Amazon about a month to credit me and they kept some of the refund to cover returning shipment costs. They said since the return was'nt their fault they wouldn't cover the return shipping. I need to call their customer service and hash it out because had their Xbox not broken I wouldn't have sent the item back ... Not sure if it's even worth the trouble. Good Luck ...
1,no fun,Controller never connects. The green light just spins around endlessly.Everyone else seems to like this piece of junk but I finally had to send it back!!
5,Great product,I love my new xbox 360 wireless controller. no worrys about tripping over wires or untangling. great stuff!!
2,Wrong color,The controller is black with a white battery cover. It was supposed to be a white controller. It works but it would have been nice to get what I ordered.
4,Pretty good for used,"Works well, in good condition except that the left analog stick sheds plastic when it rubs up against the controller. Not a big deal, but kind of annoying."
5,Xbox 360 pwns them all,Gotta have an extra one of these. This new design is way more ergonomic in my opinion. Don't invite your friend's over unless you have two of these or you intend to punish them by making them watch.
1,terrible,this guy said on his controller that it was a very good used controller and that's all it said about the product. so i bought it and he shipped me a controller with initials on the bottom and the rs analog stick didn't work and the battery pack didn't go in and come out right.
1,obviously most of you have never used a wireless controller before,"Dont get me wrong the controller is inovative and feels good and is really a grea idea but the one huge problem that noone has mentioned is how these things eat up batteries, put it this way, you need to put new AA batteries in the damn thing every three days, and that is not cool at all! I will be buying the wire controlers from now on,The premium system should have included the battery charger im othere than this MAJOR ISSUE the controller is great, but again let me stresss this issue,...it is not fun to be in the middle of an online fight in Fight Night 3 and have your controller (that you just put batteries in, well at least you thought you did) die, and get you knocked out when you were clearely winning the fight."
4,wireless is the way to go,Wireless is the way to go. I can now throw my joystick and not worry about it breaking my system. (If only they made these things out of nerf material)
5,Works flawless,"This controller works flawless for a wireless controller. I was always skeptical on wireless controllers, i thought they would lag or just disconnect in the middle of a game, but i've never experienced any of that. It's $10 cheaper here on amazon too!"
4,Awesome workout,"Awesome workout, Bob really kicks your butt and leaves you sweating so you know your losing weight and getting results!"
2,"OK, but not for me",I found it a very intense workout. it is high intensity circuit for those looking for me. Not for me though.
4,Good Workout,This workout is good. Makes you sweat with some added toning. I work out pretty often and like intense workouts and Id say this one was like an 7 out of 10 on intensity. Its a nice addition to my collection that will get used.
2,Is okay...,"After going through the songs, I decided to work on the workbook without music. Honestly the music wasn't my style. I listen to stuff like Godsmack, Nightwish, and even AC/DC. This music is geared more towards the pop culture... which even that I listen to sometimes. This music... no go.The worksheets are great though."
4,"Good Book, but Disappointing Ending","Don't get me wrong by the 4 stars, this book was really good. I think it glued me more than any of the other books in the series. It was very sad, and I was REALLY disappointed by the endng. I think I almost started crying because I was so disappointed. I hope Lurlene writes another book in this series so that I don't have to live with that ending!"
4,"Good, but not an ending","I read this book initially before I knew there were two written as prequels up to it and I wasn't satisfied with the ending. After reading the 1st book I was hooked and the 2nd, it made me want a total different ending on the this one! I think there should be another book after this one, it left so much un answered, but it was still wonderful."
3,Trouble with the PDA,"Although, I can't comment whether, it is still a smallest handheld featuring integrated three-way wireless capabilities. But one thingis sure: the speaker is cracked. Is is a defective piece. Also the integrated camera, to say the least, is pathetic. And what kind ofprocessor is Texas Instruments OMAP 1510, it frustrates more than it processes. It is very slow. On the software side of it HP hasdone a good job by providing some, great third party add on applications. Sad part of it all is the defect's are minor, and canbe fixed easily. But the inertia and indifference, towards the problem, is inexplicable. Overall it is a satisfactory product."
1,Another would-be-nice machine killed by Microsoft Windows OS,I bought this about a year ago freshky released. we have other phones in the house(Nokia) with bluetooth and same resolution camera to compare too. the result is that HP 6315 has- zero battery life (bad Windows power management)- bad camera (same hardware low res cvamera takes great pics on Nokia)- disfunctional blootooth (would not talk to any computer really (Nokia does)- it restarts by itself in the middle of conversation- bad sound quality in speaker and ear piece.Windows even managed to corrupt my SD extension card with my pm3 musics ...just total junk - stay away from WIndows Mobile and other Microsoft products.
1,Rieview for the iPAQ h6315,"The HP portion of the PDA works fine and is supported by an excellent HP service. But when it comes to the phone part, it becomes a night mare. T-Mobile US is one of the worst service providers. When calling customer care you get routed in a circle and after several call you come back to the first service agent you remember by name, but he does not remember anything.I strongly recommend to abstain from buying the specific product. The ""marriage"" between HP and T-Mobile should be long divorced. A bad taste remains on HP-products as normally they realy care for their customers.Something T-Moible still needs to learn."
2,Poor value for the money,"I am a power user and currently use the T-Mobile PPC Phone Edition - after trying Treo, etc. The upgrade to the iPaq cost $400 and was not worth the time and effort.To start, the phone quality was awful, reception was OK but not as good as with my back-up (free Nokia) and locked up several times needing a soft re-set to get it working again. Several issues with the T-Mobile PPC remain (turns itself on regularly running down the battery, numerous soft resets needed daily). The extra memory was great, no running out of program memory too quickly but programs still ""hang"" requiring soft resets. The camera was fine, not something I need. The pocket versions of Excell, Word, etc worked fine.The device itself was fine. Overall it was adequate but not worth the $400 - $500. Save your time and money on this one!"
1,Worse device ever,"A word to the wise - stay clear of this phone. Why - bad reception, dropped calls, constantly seeks service. T-Mobile? - no help, no support. They have replaced phone once - same problem. I was even told by their wireliss people that this was not a device to buy - but yet T-Mobile refuses to issue credit or deal with the issue. For those who have posted glowing reviews, you either have not used this phone for a period of time or are plants from T-Mobile or HP to give good review. This is a very poor product. I expected more from HP."
1,Poor Memory,"Unfortunately, I brought this disk many years ago. I didn't realize this until the disk came."
5,great router,This router has performed flawlesley sice I configured it. UPNP seems to work well but have only had two xboxs on at once. Soon I will put it to the real test when I hook up cable internet and host an xbox LAN. Great router.
5,"Great book, a must read for any book lover.","I have always liked Michael Palin (on TV and in movies), this is the first book I have read by him and enjoyed every page. The story is great, thought out and well written."
3,Not your usual Monty Python,"Don't let Michael Palin's Monty Python fame lead you astray. Hemingway's Chair need not have been written by a comedian. No slapstick this. It's a perceptive portrayal of a run of the mill kind of guy with more than a run of the mill passion. Gives new meaning to ""going postal,"" although I wish he had chosen another gesture. If you liked Penelope Fitzgerald's Bookshop, you'll probably like this, at least until the end."
2,Vampires in the Wild West,"I saw this film, when my town had SciFi Channel free for 10 days in January. I taped most of the films for later viuwing, but this wasn't worth it. The vampire even walked around in broad daylight. END"
3,A Three,"I've recently purchased several Northern California hiking books and found this one to be just so-so, the standard places where everyone goes. My favorite guide for this area is 100 Classic Hikes in Northern California."
5,Loved It !,I wish this guy would write more books. I liked the geology. I liked that he had a 5 star system instead of a 3 star. I like that there was a one line highlight description for each hike
3,Get what you pay for,"The packaging and seller were great. The product arrived as it should have.Here is where the problem is. The mask is cheap foam. I hoped and thought it would be a hard plastic. No I wasn't expecting a true hockey mask but at least a rigid knock off. There is also a printing logo on the outside of the foam. I noticed it right off the bat, but my daughter and wife didn't.The shirt is thin and not very realistic either. You will need a blue or black undershirt for it. We are going to put some blood and dirt on it to make it look a little better.Luckily I bought this to do a Halloween DJ gig so I won't be close to people for the most part. If it were for a Halloween party then I would have probably sent it back. Anyway if you are looking for a cheap costume then this is I guess for the money fairly good but just beware you get what you pay for."
1,rip off!,"I learned nothing from this book. Nothing. I could have written a better guide to TV writing myself. There's nothing about how to actually write a script; it's all just script samples, one a drama, one a sitcom. If this is what you're interested in, head on over to EBay for a script of a show you actually like. Otherwise, save your money!"
1,Why?,"Why would you buy a book on writing written by non-writers? Save your money. Those who can, do. Those who've never even tried write sham books about how to do it. I'm a writer who's been working steadily in network TV since I came out of the WB workshop many years ago. We were taught by talented guest television writers who came in each week, not the program administrators. That would be like learning how to have sex from a nun. Honestly, the very existence of this book makes me mad."
5,Worked well,"Rescued a pregnant dog and fostered the litter. The girl was underweight, about to give birth, and who knows her nutritional status. Our vet gave us these to give before the birth as ""prenatal"" (as much as we could get) care, and we continued after they were born to help her feed the babies. I've used these vitamins in the past for my other dogs with health problems. They come highly recommended by the vet. Great price here. Will continue to use and recommend pet tabs."
3,Fairly early Busby Burkeley makes it worth watching,"For a musical, it actually has a plot. Except for the last section done in blackface the movie holds up. The image quality is fine, the sound reasonable. Lots of implied sex, which was soon to disappear in movies until the 60s. An interesting movie. It is worth watching, particularly if you like dance in musicals"
5,GREAT product!,The cd's arrived on time. They were new and factory sealed. I would definately order from this vendor again. The music is GREAT!
1,Very poor content and presentation,"I was really disappointed with this book, particularly given that it was written by seasoned bankruptcy experts. The book is very skinny on content - it spends about 30 pages on bankruptcy law and its procedures, a few on case studies that are superficial/poorly written and several on bond analysis, and standard research tools that are well-known to a person with basic financial knowledge, ie the sort of people who would be interested in something relatively exotic as Bankruptcy Investing. The few useful pages that there are are marred by poor writing, and a complete absence of analytical frameworks that stay with the reader.Bankruptcy is a complex topic and there is a need for a book of the sort Branch and Ray have attempted. However, this is most certainly not that book."
2,extremely disappointing,"I got this book because it had a picture of the Music Machine on the cover,but this is one boring book.It's hard to believe someone could write a book about 60's garage bands and make it boring,but Michael Hicks has done it.I was mildly interested in the chapter on the evolution of the song ""Hey Joe"",but that's about it.When will authors stop writing pompously about rock'n roll?(See an old issue of ""Kicks"" magazine to see how it should be done!)"
1,ZERO STARS,"There ARE no cabinets. Terrible, misleading, a waste of money. The amount of frustration that this caused will stear me clear from EVER purchasing another Broderbund product. ..and I use to be a happy customer."
1,TOTALY.... UNFRIENDLY...zero star,I have completed my plan for my house on paper along with the dimentions.All that need to be done was to draw it in some 2d-tool so that i can get an overall picture in 3d when it will be done..so that i dont want to spend unnecessary time and money on material and labourI am simply not able to reconstruct my hand-drwan plan in this software.All i could acomplish without any trouble was the 4 walls...It sems impossible to place the objects in 3d viewAnd the components that i place in 2d view seem to apperar totaly out of place in 3dI am totaly frustrated with this softwareTERRIBLE:.....DONOT EVEN DREAM ABOUT TRYING ITif you are so desperate...thank your stars...you are better offMS.Kurinji
1,Slow Worthless Program,I agree with everyone else! There are no cabinets. It is hard to figure out. The 3D view sucks and when I try to move around it takes forever. Very slow program. Sometimes when I try to place an object it won't do it at all. They should have spent more time making this program and fixing all the problems with it. DON'T BUY IT!
2,Not Comfortable!,"The Dead On glove is the most uncomfortable glove I have ever worn. Maybe I just got a crappy pair but they seem to have been made very poorly. The 3 fingers that are not covered and have the ends open to expose the thumb, index, and middle finger are fine. But the pinky and ringer finger, which are not exposed, have serious problems. When you put your hand in and get a secure fit, it feels like your pinky and ring fingers are pushing against something on the inside of the glove. I turned them inside-out and seen that there was extra material inside on the end of these two fingers making the very uncomfortable. It feels like these two fingers are all ""scrunched"" up when you get them all the way in. I would look for a different product."
4,Berserk Movie Review,Berserk is finally on DVD! I liked this movie despite its campy aspects. Joan Crawford is great (as always) and steals the show. My major gripe is that there was a section of the movie that was cut from this DVD. Overall if you're a Joan Crawford fan you will like this movie.
5,What A Great Period It Was In Rock History,"Riot was an outstanding rock band. Their first four albums were some of the best heavy metal of the time, but their second & third albums ""Narita"" and ""Fire Down Under"" were landmark recordings. If you want to experience some extraordinary hard rock, pick up these two albums.This was a great era in rock history: the late 70's/early 80's hard rock. Before we had all digital effects and before the studio engineers destroyed albums with extreme reverb and loud drums drowning out the rest of the band, there was this short period of just plain great hard rock, not too over-produced. Riot was one of the best in that genre. Seems like they were only known in certain circles, and I would have never heard of them had it not been for a guitarist I knew who had their albums. They were such an underrated band and deserved a lot more recognition."
4,A good starting point,"More of an encyclopedia of short entries concerning unsolved historical/archaeological mysteries than anything else, this book nonetheless provides enough general information to initiate those new to these ongoing debates. It also works well for people like me, who have read endlessly about some of these topics but sometimes need to look up a generality or a name associated with a particular subject. Most of the entries are concise and informative enough to provoke further reading, and the writing style is engaging and maintains interest. It covers most of the basic subjects (the development of language and writing, the Pyramids and the Sphinx, Atlantis) and a few more ""obscure"" ones: The Land of Punt, Mithraism, Tiwanaku (from my experience, these seem to come up short in other, similar books). (From here, one might look to ""Ancient Mysteries"" by James and Thorpe, which offers fewer topics but is incredibly well-researched and detailed). Good work."
4,Great fun reading! Fantastic packing tips!,"I really loved reading Corkum Nyks' book. I have to admit that many of the packing failures sometimes hit to close to home. However, after reading the book I now save a lot of time packing and more importantly unpacking my business and holiday suitcases. Good value for money!"
2,multi-monitor primary only,"if you are thinking of buying this card for a secondary card in a multi-montitor setup, forget it. this card will only run as a primary while your expensive agp is secondary."
5,Workmate Dogs,Black & Decker has always made goodtools at a reasonable price. Best of alltheir maintenance and repair parts arealso reasonable. These dogs are no exception.The old ones finally gave out after a 150 yearsof beatin on them.
5,A beautifully faceted gem,"This is one of the most beautifully written books I have ever read.It felt like a very sacred window,looking sadly into an irretrievable past."
5,On my all-time favorites shelf,"I really, really liked this book. Other than that, I am speechless because the feelings it invoked are so personal. I placed it on my ""all-time-favorites"" shelf. I will definitely be reading more by this author."
4,inspiring,"His achievements are undeniable, and the book is an enlightening read even though the biographer's style does nothing to help the reader. How I wish someone like David McCullough could do justice to JRD's unique life!"
1,Garbage,"Any documentary that would have you believe Walid Shoebat is a trustworthy source on these issues is simply a platform for crazed religious and political zealotry. Just google Shoebat's name along with Obama's and you'll see he endorses the birth certificate nonsense, claims Obama is still a Muslim, claims Obama is the prime agent in Satan's plot against Christianity, that Obama favors abortion rights because Islamists want to see Americans kill their own children etc. The man is a complete nutbag and a complete fraud. He claims to be a former terrorist. He claims to run a charity. He claims this, he claims that. Nothing this guy says can be trusted, and that implies nothing in this documentary can be trusted. Viewer beware."
1,Myopic Vision Gone Wild,I am amazed that such a movie would get such positive reviews even though it shows Muslims as a block group. To show some uneducated but very passionate people talk on behalf of all of Islam is like showing the KKK as THE representatives of all Christianity. Utter Nonsense. The only thing that I can see how this movie can get such positive reviews is by looking at the common link of those who gave it such support--fear of the other. They wanted a reason to fear Muslims and this movie provided it.
4,Student Review,I had a class in New Religious Movements. We had to pick a movement and do an analysis paper on it. Mine was the Sufi Order International. So in order to better understand Sufism I got this book which describes a woman's 40 day fasting and isolation as she goes through mental and physical changes.It was very helpful when trying to understand a few aspects of Sufism.
4,"STILL confused, so I thought SuperHoney fans could help.","Okay. I'm trying to find out who actually did the background music to the Night of Slaughter scene, (# 22) on the Ghost Ship DVD, called ""My Little Box"". The DVD box accredits SUPERHONEY. Someone said it was Gabriel Mann, but then why would the box list SuperHoney as the artist? Any ideas?"
5,FANTASTIC album!,"I, a senior citizen, had this album for many, many years and enjoyed it immensely but Katrina washed it away. I've been searching for another copy and have found it here. It is a wonderful collection for children OR adults!"
1,Incorrect Amp Rating in Description,"I bought several of these for my outdoor Christmas lighting. I specically picked them because the product description stated ""...125-Volt, 15 Amps, 1875-Watt resistive 125-Volt,..."".The timers arrived and are clearly marked ""8.3 amps, 1000W"". They are the same manufacturer's model as listed by Amazon.I understand that most of these type of timers are max'd at 8.3 amps but, still, an item should match it's description.I'll update this review later after I see how they work."
4,Decent DVD,The music DVD is great. But I was disappointed that it was not in widescreen mode. During a section of the DVD the brothers did a series of older songs in short spurts using great harmony and simple guitar accompaniment. I wish they'd do the entire songs. The other DVD - a documentary about their past - is not that great.
1,Not what you'd expect,"My son and I got this book thinking it would cover Irish folklore. A better name would be Irish bar tales... Considering the richness of the Irish storytelling and folklore traditions, this was painful. Most tales were disjointed and not very entertaining. If this is the current oral tradition, then it's already pretty dead. Overall we were not impressed and wish we had returned it. We kept hoping it'd get better. It didn't. Maybe it's of interest to a scholar, but it's not to read for entertainment."
2,Irish Folktales,"Irish Folktales (Pantheon Fairy Tale and Folklore Library)Henry Glassy edited six different sections,nineteen different subsections, and all together one hundred twenty four works. That's a lot to organize, let alone read. The quality of some of the work he put in the book is lacking, but its part of the culture. You can't wipe it away because you don't like a story. There are just as many little stories to like in this book. Granted it wasn't to my liking or geared for my work. However, I think many people would enjoy it."
2,Don't Be Fooled By The Chatty Title,"Based upon the title, I expected this to be an easy-read, colloquial book written for the masses. NO! This is a scholarly treatise that is very dense, and difficult to read. The author appears to know the subject matter very well, but it is hard to tell because honestly, most of the references are to ancient or scholarly works that I have never heard of."
2,Great pen; horrible price.,"Don't be fooled by the 2-star rating; I love the Uni-Ball Impact metallic silver pen. It is one of the shiniest, most metallic-looking silvers you will find in a gel pen, and I use it a lot in my artwork. If you are looking for a good silver pen, do buy it. Just don't buy it here. The price and shipping cost me $8.78 just for one pen! I previously bought a two-pack of Uni-Ball Impact gold and silver pens in an office supply shop for a little over $6, so this is a huge rip-off. To make things worse, the pen I bought from Amazon was advertised to be a package of 12, so I was vastly disappointed to receive only one pen. The only reason to buy this pen from Amazon is if you have looked in all the shops in your area which sell pens and cannot find it, which unfortunately is what happened to me."
3,some nice special FX!,"Some nice special effects! Still prefer the original English version! While I admire George C. Scott, there's just not enough joy for me in his transformation!"
5,A great VERSION of Dicken's A Christmas Carol,Every time I watch this film I love the dialogue that the characters use and the haunting score. The movie looks and sounds much better on DVD. The score is almost deafining in a 2.0 Dolby Digital surround soundtrack. If you own this on VHS you haven't experienced it yet on DVD!
2,A Christmas Carol starring George C. Scott,One of the most belabored versions of this classic Christmas story ever! Good cast but why on earth deviate from the author by adding in superfluous dialog that repeats and repeats what the audience already knows? The nephew is terrible and there is so much overkill. I am a huge fan of the original story and hate to see it edited is such an amateur way. Not the best version by far.
1,Scrooge is a bad influence on kids!!!,This movie is the worst because my kids fell asleep in the middle of the movie before Scrooge turns good and now all thy do is boss ME around like scrooge. They are extremely ungrateful for all the things I have done for the and their Christmas spirit is all but gone. Do not rent this movie because it even had a bad effect on me. It has made me into a lover of material items and it took a Catholic Priest to teach me the true Christmas Spirit again!!!!
5,The Best Christmas Carol Ever,This is my favorite Christmas Carol. George C. Scott plays the best Scrooge I've ever seen. My family knows that we have to watch this version every year.
5,Best Christmas movie ever,This is a classic. This is not an unknown movie so no need to elaborate and say any more than ... GREAT
5,Favorite Christmas Movie of all time!,I love this movie so much! This was a family tradition growing up. We would watch this movie every year together.
5,Great movie,"The sound effects played when the ghosts are visiting are a little odd, but George C. is excellent and the movie is definitely worth watching."
5,Absolutely the best ever,"This telling of Scrooge's transformation never ceases to bring a tear to the eye when Scrooge regrets the time he has lost.George C. Scott, with his gravelly pitch, is the PERFECT Scrooge! His ""Mr. Cratchett!"" the day after Christmas is a classic!If you're only going to buy one Christmas Carol movie, this is it. Who cares if George C. has a believable english accent?! That has NO bearing on the plot, whatsoever! This is a tale for all people of all time. I find it MORE appealing in that he does not try to effect one and works on his craft and emotions rather than voices.To deride such a tale over voices is like complaining about the hero's wardrobe while missing the acting that is taking place within the wardrobe!This movie will touch the hardest hearts.God Bless us, everyone!"
5,Awesome Movie !,Anyone who likes The Christmas Carol must have and must watch The Christmas Carol with George C. Scott. It is the best one out there !
5,Great Classic.,"I have seen several versions of Charles Dickins' ""A Christmas Carol"", and this is by far the best. I saw a review stating that George C. Scott's British accent was lacking, and I can say that it was, but who cares!!?? Great movie, good addition to your collection, but watch it!"
3,ok,hot stuff A good read. hot stuff A good read. hot stuff A good read. hot stuff A good read. hot stuff A good read. hot stuff A good read. hot stuff A good read. hot stuff A good read. hot stuff A good read. hot stuff A good read. hot stuff A good read. hot stuff A good read. hot stuff A good read. hot stuff A good read. ou will
3,Good case but not big enough for my huge cat,"I got this pet carrier for my cat. The thing is, he is quite a large, long cat naturally (not fat, just a really big long-haired cat). Being as big as he is, he doesn't fit in the carrier without being squished lengthwise. I have no problem with the carrier itself, so I will be keeping it for future use for other cats I might acquire in my life.So if you have a larger cat, I wouldn't spend your money on this carrier because he/she probably won't fit. If you have a normal-sized cat, I would recommend this carrier!"
4,Marjorie Main,"I bought this movie only to see Marjorie Main in something else besides Ma & Pa Kettle. I liked the movie, it was fun to watch, and I would share it with a friend. I think movies are subjective and people buy them for all kinds of reasons. If you like MM, it's nice to see her in something else!"
5,Good choice,"I really like this cooker. Initially I planned to use it for cooking large quantities of ingrediients such as brown rice, garbanzos and soybeans to freeze in recipe-sized packets so that I can speed up preparation of soups, stews and casseroles, and it is very useful for that purpose. The oval shape easily accomodates a stewing chicken or corned beef, and the liftout ceramic core is very attractive on a trivet on the dining table."
4,Necessary Book for Finance,"The material in this book is necessary for anyone who is responsible for managing money or involved with a business entity doing trading in financial markets. Increasingly this is ""everyone.""The good news is that the conclusions and punchlines are presented clearly and simply. A person who does not want to follow the math (there is a lot of it) can skip to the arguments and conclusions and get an enormous amount of valuable information. The bad news is that little effort has been expended to make the math attractive. A person wishing to slog through the math will have to be prepared to sit down with pencil & paper & patience. Some editing by someone who cared would have made this book much more attractive to the average student. Martin Baxter & Andrew Rennie's ""Financial Calculus"" gives a good example of how this can be done."
3,Arguments for economists talking to economists,"I found this less interesting than I had hoped. It seemed written for economists, not the intelligent reading public. The book spends little time introducing accessible economic puzzles that might interest the general reader. Instead, it spends its time refuting established economic principles using vocabulary and phrases from economic academia.I wish the book had proposed some alternative economic principles to replace those the author attacks. I don't quibble with the arguments, they just didn't have much impact.For a better intro to behavioral finance, try Thaler's 'The Winner's Curse.' For something more positive, check out 'The Economy as an Evolving Complex System.'"
3,Rather mediocre... an ok album but you can do better,"I mean you can really do better with your money than buy this album. Except for a couple of tracks which you can get on almost any AW compilation there is really nothing here to listen to. The rest of the songs are pretty derivative and extremely similar to the rest of the arena-rock manufactured by megatons at the time of the album's release. ""Roller"" is an ok rocker but again it's not a real hit from my point of view. There is no song here that leaves me enthralled and begging for more. First two tracks are universally considered the highlights but I wouldn't give them more than a B- in my report card."
4,Nice comfortable waterproof clog,"Very nice waterproof clog...Very comfortable to wear too. My only complaint is that you need to wear socks with it or your feet make squeaky sounds in the shoes, otherwise I would have given them 5 stars....."
5,Wonderful gardening shoe,"I purchased my sloggers from a retail store by my home. I absolutely love them! They are great to wear while working in your yard. If they get muddy/dirty, just wash them off with the waterhose and they are clean again."
3,Just not there,"This book provides no more than less of everything. Approximately more than 65% requires improv. because nothing is written. Some of the times, no bass cleff, and sometimes, no treble cleff! Only the singing notes. Hmm...I wonder if you are not Sarah Mclachlan herself, how are you supposed to play this?! I am a one of the hardcore Sarah fans and I would only recommend this book to others who play music with Sarah and of course, her! Well, except you are as excellent as a performer as Sarah. So then, you will have fun with this book."
1,Bad info on the Delta Web Site,"I recently bought a Delta 36-650 10 inch table saw. After looking on the Delta web site, it listed this Dado Insert (34-672) as the correct one for this saw. Well, it was wrong. The correct dado insert for the 36-650 saw is the 34-264 (for 7-8 inch dados), there is a seperate part for 10 inch dado blades. So... I guess I'll be sending this one back... :("
3,"They seem like nice bits, but DON'T FIT my Dremmel","I got these because the description led me to believe they would work in my dremmel tool. I received them and tried to use them, but the pieces were too small for either of my dremmel tools. Hopefully they work in a full-sized drill."
1,Not happy.,Unfortunately the drill bits were not able to due the job I wanted. They are not strong enough to hold up to the task of drilling holes into crystal - I was hoping to make Christmas presents. Would not recommend them.
4,Great Printer,"Both my wife and I are very happy with this printer. Scans well, prints fast. Wan't too hard to setup."
1,Canon MP830 - Worst office machine I've ever had.,"I bought this all in one printer because I had read some good reviews about it... but now I struggle daily to keep from throwing it through the window. The paper in the tray jams on about every 3rd to 5th page. It will not print faxes if ink is low, even though low ink cartriges still have quite a bit of life left in them. There is a long pause between changing from copy setting to fax. It will not fax or print incoming faxes if left on ""copy"" setting and will not copy if it's on ""fax"" setting. The quality of the print is good, but very costly in ink consumption. I would not recommend this printer and can not believe it gets such good reviews."
1,!! SCAM: uses colour inks for black in duplex and grey in general,"Hard to belief but true. Canon support confirmed this ""issue"": this printer (also next generation mx850) uses the colour ink catridges for printing in grey. Further it prints black in duplex mode with the colour catridges, too. If a customer wants to print in black he is right to expect that the big black ink is used. So, actually this is a SCAM from Canon to its customers. That makes the printer tremendously expensive."
1,Very disappointed,"Our MP830 failed after twenty months of very infrequent use. And we are not alone. Google error code 6A00, and you will see how our machine failed like apparently thousands of others. Apparently Canon's ink innovation of separating the ink jets from the ink storage containers was a miserable failure."
1,Avoid this glorified printer!,"When I first began using my all in one, I loved it (except for the fact I had to be careful how much ink I was using!). I even got a new computer to go along with it after a few months, and that is where the trouble began. My new HP and the Canon function ONLY as a printer. The other features do NOT work. Canon blames HP, saying it is a twain issue and something on the HP is preventing it from scanning. HP blames Canon software. After dozens of hours with tech support on both sides, neither will accept responsibility for the problems. I cannot get a refund on either product, and here I sit with a glorified printer that uses enormous amounts of ink. AVOID THIS PRODUCT!!!"
4,All in One worked perfectly out of box,"I had no problem setting up the PIXMA MP830; chose it because it was highest rated in recent not-to-be-named consumer publication PLUS I was enthusiastic about the Canon brand--I had a Canon copy machine that worked well for an unbelievably long time (13+ years)! The new all-in-one takes a bit longer than my old Canon to warm up and produce the first copy--but the PIXMA MP830 cost just a little more than a new toner cartridge alone would have cost for the old PC-6RE, and it does so much more. Color printing works nicely, although I had a problem using my Picasa2 print feature with it (layout came out wrong). However, the included SW (Easy Photo-Print) produced good results. I was disappointed that I cannot directly insert my Fuji XD memory card into the card slot--need to buy an adaptor somewhere; wish Canon would have mentioned that or included an adaptor (no big deal anyway, my SanDisk card reader connects directly to my PC, so I'll continue to use that)"
1,Scanner and Fax Broke down after 2 years,Don't buy this printer. I bought it for around $360 and after 2 years it is just a piece of junk. Do not buy any Canon's MP830. Not worth the money.
1,Very Poor Paper Handling,"I bought this computer yesterday and went through the complete installation process only to find out that it has very poor paper control. The paper feeder (very flimsy) is in the back which difficult if you change paper sizes alot, but the worst is that if you are a Paper Source addict like I am, you can forget about printing on Paper Source Luxe Paper and Envelopes. This printer jammed everytime I ran a thick piece of paper or envelope through. I read every review on this website before I bought and all anyone discusses is its copying, faxing and printing photograph capabilities. A printer should print beautiful documents and invitations, too. After my two paper jams, I loaded that printer right back to the store and bought an HP All in One Officejet 7410. I've been printing on thich cardstock and square cards all morning...its perfect!"
2,Why aren't all cables included with the item?????,"I find it extremely aggravating that this all-in-one printer doesn't come with the necessary cables to connect it to your computer, and that they must be bought separately.Way to go Canon to squeeze out more money from the consumers.It was aggravating because I bought this for my daughter going to college and upon opening it up and tryng to set it up, we couldn't connect it to her computer.I had bought this from another website, but be forewarned that you need additional cables not included."
1,TERRIBLE RELIABILITY,"I have similar problems to the reviewer below. Even though I have used the printer very lightly, it jams regularly on Canon photo paper and then spills ink everywhere. Today it went into ""service error 5700"" and it doesn't work any more, even after rebooting it five times.I will not buy a Canon printer ever again."
4,So far so good...,"My husband and I bought this printer about 2 months ago and so far it's been great! The only thing we haven't used on it yet is the fax. So far the photocopy aspect of it is our favorite, it's great just to put the pile of paper in the feed and have it go through no problem.The only down side was when we tried to print photos, they came out with smudges of black ink on them. Other than that every printout, both black and white as well as colour, looks great!It also takes it a little while to warm up when you first turn it on, but for me it's really not a huge deal...you just have to give it time to do it's thing (less than 1 minute) and then you're off!"
1,So Sad,"Canon inkjet machines are money pits. Unless you use them frequently, the inkjets clog requiring a printhead repalcement. Printhead replacement is a waste of money. At this point you may has well toss the printer out the window. Now the ""all in one"" will not turn on - even to scan. What a shame!! Other features on this printer worked very well. So sad.It is not the first time I have been disappointed with Canon printers. It WILL be my last. I will be getting an Epson dedicated scanner to go with a Brother black laser printer."
5,Excellent (even in duplex mode),"Although I purchased the printer in a retail store I thought that I would make a comment here on the printer. I am totally happy with this unit, unlike the experience I had with a HP unit the paper handling for the sheet feeder works well and has not jammed yet. Print quality is excellent and it is fairly fast. I liked this printer so much that I purchased one of these for my father."
4,John Barrymore's Last Appearances In The Series,"BULLDOG DRUMMOND's REVENGE is a 1937 movie based on Sapper's novel THE RETURN OF BULLDOG DRUMMOND. The villain (Fank Puglia) tries to steal a secret formula for an explosive. John Barrymore appears as Colonel Neilson and John Howard has the role of Bulldog Drummond. Louise Campbell is Phyllis Clavering and Reginald Denny plays the part of Drummond's pal Algy Longworth.BULLDOG DRUMMOND'S PERIL was a 1938 movie which was not up to the standards of the rest of the series and it marked John Barrymore's last appearance as Colonel Neilson. John Howard, Louise Campbell and Reginald Denny also acted in this film."
5,Multi-layered,"I watched this on IFC the other day. It's very cute, fluffy and fun, but there were some serious issues in it, too. Excellent cast. Rupert is a great character, and I find myself hoping that things worked out for him, silly as that may sound."
1,Not a toy.,This board is a little dull. I thought it would be prettier. The pointer slides roughly and makes a scraping noise.
1,Playing with danger,"I was originally over the moon with my board and used it often...messages seemed loving and sincere, but I listened to it carefully and after following its ""advice"" am now a dialysis patient.Please leave well alone and I would say the same for all boards...they certainly are not fun and it is not worth playing around with however curious you are.Take are."
2,it will break,Just needed something quick and cheap and this was it. I knew it wouldnt last long but i ordered anyway. The adapter and mics on these things just dont last long even when new. Ive gone through 5 of these over the years and keep them for guest and friends when they come over. If you something right now until you can save 60 bucks and get a real gaming headset this is it. Just know this it wont last long just like the one your probably replacing that came with the Xbox.
3,Decent but not good for a permanent replacement,I bought this as a temporary replacement for my turtlebeach delta and I have to say it is okay. The only problem I had was the fact that it has a swivel earpiece and it would always bend and hurt my ear. Other than that it is okay and the price was great
4,Great Bargain,"We bought two of these headsets thinking they were the MS headsets. It turned out that they are knockoffs. They were really cheaply priced, but they work just as well as the official MS headsets. If you want cheap headsets and are willing to wait a month for them, then buy from Hummerfan19."
1,Unreliable....don't waste your money,"This headset is unreliable. After only owning it for approximately 7 weeks, the audio became garbled and would fade in and out. I was going to replace it with another, but different persons told me NOT to buy another one. They said a better headset is made by Planetronics. Even if you think the wireless headset by Microsoft will work better (but costs triple), the complaints with that have been: batteries need constant recharging and the audio also fades in and out. AARRGH! If you are determined to buy one by Microsoft anyway, save your receipt just in case. And if they offer an extended warranty, you may consider that as a backup option!!!"
1,Don't waste your money,"I am an adult gamer and I've owned 4 (FOUR!) of these headsets including the ""new and improved"" version and have given up. The wire connecting to the controller is so incredibly thin that it breaks even if you take great care of it. My last one lasted exactly 32 days, 2 days after Best Buy will take returns.It all boils down to Microsofts profits. The thin wire that connects the headset to the controller actually has 4 wires inside of it, giving it almost no hope of any long term survivalPlus, you can't even turn voices up loud enough to hear your friends well anyway.Look into headsets made by someone other than Microsoft!"
2,not great,Broke within two days. Wouldn't suggest buying this product for a long term usage. I was very dissapointed in the quality
4,get what you pay for,"it is just a basic xbox mic came in good time , but it is not an official Microsoft product looks just like one but no Microsoft markings and the plastic is off you now that old white- yellow plastic on really old pc cases it's just like that."
3,Required work,"Out of the box this product was not functional. After taking it apart and fixing it, it worked fine. One should expect the product to work from the start. Not so much with this one."
2,too fragile for fun,"I bought this headset, and not even within a year, it broke. It's way to fragile, and needs to be more sturdy. Granted, it's just being worn on your head, but when it gets set down, shared, what-have-you, accidents happen (and its happened more than once)."
1,Stay Away unless you like buying one every month,"I have gone through 4 wired mics. 2 came bundled with the chat pad. 1 came with the console, and 1 was a third party one. They have all sucked. Sure they work for a little while. But sooner or later they will break on you. And it's more sooner than later. Apart from constantly breaking, they are also very finicky when they are connected. Sometimes I'll have to twist it around while it's plugged in for it to register. I have been able to extend the lives of the mics for a little while by doing that, but in the end they will break on you after a short time.Seeing as you can get a wireless mic for the price of 2 of these POS mics, I'd say go for a wireless mic.If you value your money, stay away from these mics at all cost. It's not worth the money."
3,Xbox 360 Head Set Communicator,I waited a long time for this product then when I got it the mouthpiece was loose and wouldn't stay where I put it. It kept falling down.
2,NOT IN PACKAGE!,"In the pictures you have it shown in the new packaging but I received a ""never used"" (maybe) headset in a orange bag."
4,xbox 360 headset,standard xbox live headset that comes with starter kit. They are not the most durable as i had to purchase this one because my other one broke. This has yet to break so I would say i have already got my use out of it. Pretty good deal for just the communicator. It works better than nothing.
1,Garbage Headset,"Ordered in July, just broke. Only lasted a few months. You get what you pay for I guess. Won't make this mistake a second time."
3,Get your moneys worth,For 7$ you get exactly what you pay for. My original mic was great and never had any problems but with this one i have to constantly unplug the base and blow on the receiver and connecter otherwise i end up with alot of static in the earpiece and people complaining about the noob whose mic is buzzing. But after it works its just as good as the 20$ one
1,is it just me???,"Is it just me or has anyone else had the problem of when you connect the headset to the controller everyone can hear you perectly,But you can barely hear them and it sounds like there gargling while takling?..Xbox has sent me 2 headsets and still the same..I've tried both my controllers (both wireless) and still the same...I don't know if its just the way the headsets were made or what but IT MAKES PLAYING ONLINE HORRIBLE!!!!!...I was looking forward to playing 360 online but until I get a headset or till I can hear my friends without them sounding like there stuffing there face while talking I guess I'll stick too single player or just not use a head set... very very very very dissapointed...The 360 work fine on the games and runs em smooth So I don't think its the 360 but you never know...I say wait till a new one comes out from a 3rd party..but if you need one,get one,and hopefully you don't have to go through the same thing I am =/... 1/5 starsss!"
1,Very delicate.,"Me and my brother have gone through 6 of these between the two of us. The one that came with my Elite was dead on arrival. It didn't work at all, instead of wasting time with the warranty, I bought a new one(they've now changed the design a little bit). That one also was DOA and I returned it. My brother has gone through 4 headsets without misuse and is now using a Sprint cell phone headset because it's a waste of money to continue to buy Microsoft headsets. I would recommend a different brand other than Microsoft, possibly Motorola."
3,Acid Mothers Temple - 'Absolutely Freak Out: Zap Your Mind!' (Static Resonanse) 3 1/2 stars,"Two solid hours of your typical Acid Mothers Temple brain-damaging wall of space noise-rock to be fully taken in. On this 2-CD offering, AMT had apparently become a twelve piece. Only comment I could honestly make about 'Absolutely Freak Out' is that it could have just as easily been cut down to a single-disc release. Best tracks include the nineteen-minute ""Supernal Infinite Space"", ""Grapefruit March"" and tripping twenty-four minute slab of sonic mayhem ""Children Of The Drab"". Recommended, only if you're a major Acid Mothers fan (like myself)."
5,Let the good projects roll!,"If you don't have an outfeed table, get this roller stand. Good price. Solid construction. Excellent bearings in the single roller. I replaced my original outfeed stand that had the ball bearings with this model. Too tough to adjust. This one is a great value!"
1,bad description,"ITEM WAS DESCRIBED WITH CERTAIN FEATURES, WHEN YOU TRY TO USE THOSE FEATURES, A POP-UP COMES UP AND TELLS YOU NEED CREATACARD GOLD TO EXCESS THAT FEATURE, SAME FOR SOME OF THE ART WORK, YOU CANNOT,GET IT SOME OF IT WITH OUT CREATACARD GOLD THAT WAS NEVER IN THE DESCRIPTION.OR THAT YOU HAD TO HAVE THE INTERNET ON."
5,bleach!!!,"I'm 27 years old and my hubby is 34 and we're proud to say Bleach is our new obsession...it's appropriate for pretty much all ages, witty, and highly addictive, even for folks who aren't comic book people."
5,Great manga!,I am happy with the story so far. I feel that the the cartoon tends to leave small details out in which the book does not. Great for collection and fans.
1,Way way way too flexy,Did I mention that this keyboard is flexy? Way too flexy? It is. Couldn't use it. Sent it back. I don't want to be annoyed while typing.
2,"Great keyboard, but where are the Windows keys?!","I just got it, plugged it into the Advanced Mini Dock for my T61, and all seemed well until I noticed two things that really bothered me.- It lacks a Windows key anywhere, and I use that key excessively for bringing up the file explorer (Win-E), toggling the desktop (Win-D), and getting a command line (Win-R). It also lacks the Windows context key usually found on the lower right - I never use that, so no big deal. Thinkpad keyboards have them, so why doesn't this keyboard?- The blue Thinkvantage key doesn't bring up the Thinkvantage menu on my T61.Other than that, it seems to be a nice keyboard, but nowhere as good as the keyboard on my actual T61."
2,Could be better,"If you want an expensive CD with only three songs and a whole bunch of useless computer screensavers and wallpapers, then this is for you. I paid [more] for mine and was very disappointed. I reccomend you buy either 2BA Master or Totally Pokémon if you want a good Pokémon CD!"
5,"Intelligent, engaging, practical.","This book is one of the most engaging books on Zen that I have had the good luck to discover. In addition to providing a concise discussion of the relationship between the foundational notions of modern psychoanalysis and the day-to-day work of Zen practice, Magid provides a lively discussion of twelve famous koans. Not only does Magid use his experience as a psychoanalyst to inform his view of Zen practice, he uses his experience of Zen practice to elucidate concepts in psychoanalysis. Best of all, he has written a book that is intelligent, engaging, and practical!"
2,This book is rated by me O.K.,THe reason I gave this book 2 stars is because I thought it was very boring. I did not like how Teresa treated her family. I thought it was very mean of her to say she hated her parents for takieng her on the train. This book also did not make a lot of sense. Even though I did not finish the book the part I read was not very good. There are only 1 book in this series I do not rate 4-5 stars and this is the book. This is just my opnion though.
5,I think Teresa's diary is a lot like life today.,"She is always thinking of her friends back home, and writing to them. They have many troubles on their way to the Idaho Territory, but they get through them and make their way there. Even though loved ones die or leave and go out on their own, Teresa's family didn't turn back. They kept on and when they got to the Idaho Territory, they made a farm. I think she should have married J.W. though. He sounded so nice."
4,Great project for a kid,This was really fun and easy to make. Didn't even need to read directions real easy! I even had left over paint and was able to use the blo-pens for other projects
3,My initial impression was favorable. I particularly liked ...,"My initial impression was favorable. I particularly liked that they list a reason for each ingredient's presence. I was a little concerned that the consistency was very liquidy but it seemed to thicken up and lather well when applied. Upon opening, the soap had a pleasant, if somewhat strong, lemon smell. However, after drying my hands I noticed my skin had a distinct metallic smell, similar to that obtained when using the soap in public restrooms. Since I can't tolerate that smell, I wouldn't buy this product. However, this may well be a personal prejudice and shouldn't discourage others from trying it if they want a natural product that works well."
4,This Album Smokes,"Recorded around the time of Deep Purple In Rock, thisis a must for any serious collector of Ritchie Blackmore'swork."
1,I got alleric reaction when I used Shea Moisture Organic & Aloe Thikening Growth Milk because it has Grape seed oil,"I got allergic reaction when I used Shea Moisture Organic & Aloe Thikening Growth Milk because it has Grape seed oil.Grape seed oil has so many side effects, I'd like grape seed oil to be eliminated from the formula."
4,I like it!,"As far as detangling, I'm not sure this is the greatest but it is very moisturizing. I used it as a leave-in and also as a styler for my 2-strand twists. It does the job but I think I will save it for the winter. Thats just how thick it is. In the summer, for me, a thick leave-in is not needed."
2,Not too great for Relaxed Hair,"I purchased Shea Moisture Shea Butter Leave in Conditioner because a previous reviewer had stated this conditioner had worked well on her relaxed hair. While I'm glad it worked well for her, I don't think I'll be sticking with this product.As many of my fellow relaxed-haired sisters know, it's hard to maintain moisture when your hair is being exposed to harsh straitening chemicals every few months. So I was hoping this product would do the trick, especially with all the sparkling reviews. However, while I didn't have an overly negative experience, I think my search will continue for the ""perfect conditioner"".Pros- It smells great. It's nice and thick, covering each strand of hair.Cons- Left a residue on my hair; residue turned gooky over time which then turned flaky and was hard to wash out. Left hair slightly stiff.Again, this product may work well for other women, it's just not for me. Good luck ladies!"
3,Doesn't mix well,I really don't like that it doesn't mix well with other products. I have natural afro textured hair and need to seal in the moisture to keep my hair moisturized. This product leaves white residue when mixed with oils.
4,Good natural Moisturizer,"This is not only good for naturals... It is good for relaxed hair. I have not had a relaxer in five months, but it works well for the straight hair. It leaves my hair soft and nourished. And it smells good. Not like shea butter... more like a fruity smell. I would recommend this to anyone with African/African American hair."
3,moisture not so much;,didnt really provide much moisture; which is the only reason I purchased the shea mix instead of basic shea butter;
3,Made my relaxed hair Soft,I gave this product 3 stars because when i putthe product in my hair it left a white film on my hair. After about 5 minutes the product actually penetrated into my hair shaft and left it insanely SOFT! I used this product after doing my aphoogee protein treatment. It made my hair feel wonderful. I will be buying more of this leave in conditioner.
1,nutcracker classiks on toys,"Do not waste your money. Even for children, this CD has a ""tinny"" sound and does not do the beautiful music of the Nutcracker justice."
2,won't use this again,"it has helped with clearing my skin a little, but it dries it out really bad and it REALLY stings when i put it on (so much so that my eyes water)."
5,very good product,"So far, this is a good product. Its clearing up small bumps and I'll continue to use it. I'll ptobably buy it again when its finished. I like that I can apply a little to the cotton ball so I have alot left."
4,Marley clan lives on!,"Damian Marley is the next great artist to come about,the mix of dance hall,music with reggae,makes him just awesome,this album is a musthave."
5,Works great,I bought this for my 5 year old son who sucks his thumb at night to fall asleep. It worked wonders. Within a few days he quit the habit. The taste is awful and enough to make him stop. I highly recommend this to anyone.
4,It tastes really bad but works,The problem I have now its that my husband doesn't want to use it. He was telling me that it was because of the shinny look. I have discovered that also hates the taste (hahaha)
2,"sadly, didn't work","I've tried everything to stop my 3 year old from sucking his thumb. This got such great reviews, even a friend of mine had success with this when nothing else worked. However, it didn't even phase my son. I tried it myself and it sure would keep me from biting/sucking. YUCK. Sorry it didn't work for us."
3,My kid powered through the taste,What can I say? I have one of those kids that will do anything to suck her thumb. It worked the first two days and then she got use to it. I tasted it. It's disgusting. I don't know how she managed. I wouldn't try it again if it was on my thumb.
5,SOOOO THANKFUL!,"I can't say enough good things.... My 5-year old twin daughters absolutely refused to stop sucking their thumbs. Everytime they would all I could hear in my mind was cha-ching to the dentist. We had tried EVERYTHING!!!! Tape, socks, finger splints, THUMB, offering money, and threats to cut off the thumb (Not like I would really do that, but it was worth a shot). We applied the Mavala stop to the girls' thumbs and in about 2 weeks.. they were DONE! (insert jumping up and down - HAPPY). I would recommend this product to anyone that is trying to get their children to stop."
5,Love it,"It stopped my 5 year old daughter from biting her nails immediately. I only apply it every 3-4 days, but she remembers it's there, and no problems. I love it."
1,Not for me,I bought this for my son who is a chronic nail biter. Unfortunately it didn't work at all.
3,effective but not long lasting,"Effective while on the nails, I found myself reapplying to my 4 year old's fingers nightly. The directions indicate to reapply every 48 hours, but I would catch my little guy sucking the second night if I didn't reapply. Needing to remember to apply nightly is challenging."
5,Product Lives Up to Its Word,"This product worked extremely well and served its purpose. My 8 1/2 year old son, who has sucked his thumbs since he was a baby has successfully broken the habit! This was accomplished practically overnight. I have recommeded Mavala to the school nurse and a local orthodontist. They are planning to purchase cases of it."
5,Did the job!,Bought this for my 4 year old who has been sucking her thumb from about the time she was born. It took 4 days and she stopped completely! I am so grateful for the friend who recommended this product... the only thing I did notice is that I had to put it on everyday and not every other day.
1,Does not work,"I ordered this for my 2 1/2 year old son for his nail bitting habbit. We put the polish on 3 times a day but no effect. He kept bitting the nails and some times he even said ""yum-yum""... Not working for him.."
1,Did not work,"We tried this on our 3-year old and the first 2 days he did not like it at all and stopped sucking his fingers. After the second day, however, he went right back to sucking like there was nothing on his fingers. One week after, we are still putting the Mavala on his fingers but he is still sucking away. Any suggestions on other products?"
5,Love it for my daughter!!,This is the only thing that stops my daughter from putting her fingers and thumb in her mouth. I give it 10 stars!!
3,Mavala Stop,"This product is just okay. I had to keep putting it on my son, after washing his hands, and showering. He didn't like the taste of it and it helped him to not suck him thumb, but I had to keep putting it on."
2,so-so for toddler thumb sucking,"I bought this to stop my 4-year-old son from sucking his thumb. It worked like magic the first 2 days, but then I guess he got used to it, because it works for about 10 minutes after application then he's back to sucking his thumb. It definitely tastes bad. I guess it depends how dedicated your kid is to sucking his thumb! It's worth a try, though."
5,It works!,"I am 19 and I've been a pretty hard core nail biter for about four or five years. I have tried painting my nails constantly but that doesn't deter me. I have always been pretty skeptical of products like this but I decide to give it a shot after my cousin, who is worse than I am, found success. I've only been using the product now for about two weeks but the difference is amazing! I actually am starting to have nice nails for the first time that I can remember. I actually haven't applied it now for three or four days and I'm still not biting my nails! The bitter taste really conditions you to not bite your nails. The only down fall of this product is that you really have to make sure to be careful when you are eating finger foods and stuff, otherwise you accidently get the really disgusting taste of the product which kind of ruins the taste of the food. Overall this product is wonderful and well worth the cost!"
3,Can't even eat finger foods anymore...,"I have really mixed feelings about this product. So far it has really helped me not bite my nails because of the terrible taste. However, I can't even eat finger foods anymore because I can taste it even after not using it for a couple days. Chips and Guac Gone...Cereal Gone..I hope once my nails grow out the taste will eventually go away because I can't take much more of this. My brother used this too to stop biting his nails and the same thing happened to him. He won't use it anymore."
5,Mavala's review on a 6 year old,"I didn't think it would work at first...My son still sucked his thumb and then, about a week into my continuing the product, stopped.Note: three weeks later he found it and threw it out. (keep out of their sight or they will sabotage the strategy!) I'm going to buy some more. Really works."
2,OK but then stopped working,This product worked for a few days then my son must have gotten used to it because he continued to suck his thumb..even after twice a day applications!
2,Did not work for us,I had high hopes that this would stop my daughter from sucking her finger. I put it on and for that day she pulled her finger out as soon as she put it in. However she discovered that if she kept drinking water it would be better. Now three days later we have continued to repply but she doesn't seem to mind it anymore and thinks its a game to try and stick her fingers in my mouth. The stuff tastes bad and I don't know how she does it but my two year old was not put off for long using this product.
2,"Definitely deterred the biting, but didn't stop it","I was so hopeful this was going to work after reading all the other reviews. Our 3-year old bites her fingernails and toenails until they bleed and we are worried about her health. We applied this liberally and every day (despite the claim that the product should be applied every other day), but she would pick it off and kept on biting. We're hopeful we'll find something that works, but this didn't do it for us."
2,Doesn't taste like anything to me,"I just received this yesterday with the hope that I could use it to stop my 2.5 year old's pacifier use. Our Pediatrician suggested we use this so I thought I'd give it a try. It arrived yesterday and I figured I better try it on myself before I give it to her to see what I should expect, but I'm confused because it doesn't really taste like anything. It just tastes like really strong fingernail polish, but not horrible or disgusting as others have posted. I don't bite my nails, but I do occasionally put my nails in my mouth when I am bored or just sitting around and I just realized I had the nail I painted in my mouth and it really didn't have any affect on me whatsoever, it just started tasting a tiny bit bitter and that is how I remembered that it had the polish on it.I'm not sure if I got a bad/old batch, or if different taste buds perceive the taste differently. I will update when I've tried it on my daughter to see if she has a different reaction."
2,Not that impressed,"I bought this to use with my 3 and 1/2 year old son who bites his fingernails nearly all the time. It worked the first day (and that may have been more of a placebo). We re-applied it after 2 days and I still noticed he was biting his nails, so we went to applying it every day. Still chewing incessantly. I have tasted it and do believe that it could work, but I think my son has gotten used to the bitter taste and it doesn't bother him now. He still bites his nails terribly and I've given it nearly 2 weeks. I'm not all that impressed."
2,Did not work for 4 yr old avid nail-biter,The first couple days it was a deterrent and then the taste must not be too bad because he went right back to the biting. It says to do every other day - I did it daily and it still didn't stop him. Not sure what we are going to do...
3,Works for a while...,The taste of this product is absolutely awful! I will stay my nail biting stopped immediately but only until the product wears off... anything you touch (including food) tastes awful so I stopped using it. This is for desperate measures but obviously not for finger foods.
3,"Depends on taste, i guess.","My daughter has a nail chewing problem. This was the highest reviewed problem so I thought I would give it a try. When it arrived I applied it to her fingers right away. I put some on my own finger nail because I didn't want to expose her to something that I was not willing to do to myself. I licked my finger nail after the product had dried and it was AWFUL! And the taste didn't go away for hours no matter what I ate or drank. So I thought this would be great and she would break the habit of finger nail chewing right away. A couple days later she informed me that she kind of liked the taste though. Overall I would recommend this product because, for any normal person, it will be a great deterrent to putting fingers in the mouth. If your kid is some kind of mutant like mine, I guess it will be money wasted."
5,Amen for Mavala,"This product does what is says. My 8 year old stop sucking her thumb in 2 weeks and is now proud of herself. My 5 year old has stop sucking too but I still apply it to her thumbs as she sometimes puts the finger in her mouth to test if it still has a bad taste. My 9 month old will get his thumb painted when he gets a little older. Both girls cried the first week, but I had to practice tough love. I stayed with them at nights and held their hands to help them to fall asleep and explained to them that I was doing this to protect their teeth and smile.I tried it on myself and co-workers. It is awful, the taste lingers for a while and I did not put my finger near my mouth for days. It does destroy finger foods.Amen MavalaNatalieKingston Jamaica"
2,Tastes Yuck but my daughter got used to it,The product tasted really really bad. My daughter hated it so much that she felt like throwing up the first time we applied it to her nails. We wanted to get rid of her finger sucking habit. Looked like it worked during the first 2 days but then she stopped worrying about the taste and started sucking her fingers more. Guess she understood we were trying to get rid of her bad habit and so started doing it more. Might be its good for older people biting finger nails but not so good for 2 year old kids.
1,does not work for my kid,"The box says it doesn't work for kids under three because of undeveloped taste buds but the online description does not (my kid is three-and-a-half). The serum is supposed to work for two days, but 24 hours later my kid is unaffected. I tasted it and it is just like wet nail polish. Maybe this will work on her next year...bummer."
4,Working so far..,"Started using this a week ago to stop the thumb sucking habit for my 3.5 yr old daughter. So far it seems to be quite effective. The first time I applied it to my daughter's nails she gagged a bit and spit rightaway when she tried to suck her thumbs, but it seems to have had a big effect on her. She has completely stopped thumb sucking for almost a week now, and I only had to apply it one more time after the initial application (2 days after the initial one). So far very happy with the product. The only slight concern I have is about the chemical ingredients in the product even though it hasn't caused any adverse effects in terms of health."
1,DOES NOT WORK,"My dentist strongly recommended this to me for my daughter at about 4-5 years old- she is now six and we are still using it to no avail (we have been trying to kick this habit since age TWO). She said it had a 100% success rate. Well, meet the first failure. I think maybe it did not work because we eat spicy and ethnic foods- not chicken nuggets and mac-n-cheese. Her palate can tolerate the strong taste. Either that or she is just determined to suck that thumb!! Hope it works for you. : ("
5,Stopped our 4yr-old thumb sucking immediately,"Our 4yr old daughter stopped sucking her thumb in one day -- no joke. She was constantly sucking her thumb, when she was tired, bored, scared, hungry, and all through the night. We tried everything else like bandages, gloves, positive and negative reinforcement. But nothing was going to come between her and her thumb. One taste of the Mavala Stop on her thumb and she never wanted to put her thumb in her mouth again. A week later we've stopped using it and the habit is broken, no more sucking. I know this product won't work for every child, but it was the perfect solution for our child."
5,I can't believe this worked so well!!!!!,"This stuff was amazing! My daughter who is 2 1/2 would not stop sucking her ring and middle finger. We bought this product and put it on her like nail polish before bed. She loves nail polish, so there was no foolery about it. We had worked her up to it telling her that if she didn't stop sucking her fingers they were going to start to taste bad. Sure enough she came out the next morning telling me that her fingers tasted bad because she had tried to suck them.... within the week she had stopped even trying. She even was asking for me to paint her nails before bed! She is now 3 years old and still hasn't gone back to sucking her fingers!!! This product is amazing! We had tried tape and bandaids on her fingers before... nothing helped. Thanks for such an awesome product!"
5,27 years of nail biting-- done,"bit my nails for 27 years before getting ""Stop""after a couple of weeks with the product I was able to stop using it, and haven't bitten my nails for 6 months. I didn't think it would be so easy. I've tried a bunch of times before. I'm very proud of myself, and wish other people cared to pat me on the back for something which seems so inconsequential to them. Highly reccomend Mavala. I bought the .3oz (10ml) bottle, and didn't even put a dent in it it looks like.One small note: pretty much a finger food killer. on the plus side, it's pretty fun to shove your fingers into significant others' mouths and ruin their night."
5,AMAZING!!!!!,"This product is a miracle! My four year son had been sucking is two fingers at night and when he was tired forever. I started using Mavala Stop and he has not sucked his fingers in over a month now. The first couple days are a little tough, but it was amazing to me how well it worked because he was VERY dependent on sucking his fingers throughout the entire night. The dentist was also very happy too. Incredible product!"
5,Excellent product for the willing spirit,"My daughter is 7 years old and had sucked her thumb since birth. She could do without sucking her finger during the day but couldn't stop at bedtime. So she was ready to stop but couldn't stop the habit. I purchased this item on a friends recommendation, and applied it nightly for about 25 days (some nights we forgot). After that my daugher has stopped sucking her thumb. I think this product is a useful tool when the child is ready."
5,It works,My 3yr old son has been sucking his finger since he was a baby and it was really begining to mess up his teeth. I had seen some VERY expensive finger gaurds to prevent thumb/finger sucking but I didn't want something embarrassing or uncomfortable for him. Then I saw this Mavala stop for a few dollars so decided to give it a try. Just like that my sons habit is gone. This was an all day everyday habit for him. I can't believe how easy it was!Just as a side note I tell my son that the bad taste is a reminder that he is a big kid now. Not punishment. That made him more cooperative.
3,Disappointed,Unfortunately it did not stop my 3 yr old daughter from biting her nails.It is possible that she is too young for the product.I tasted it and it really tastes awful!!I will keep using it and hopefully the horrible taste would eventually stop the nail biting.
5,love it,"i was biting my nails all the time since i was a little girl, now that I used this my nails are long and pretty. i dont even have an urge to put my fingers in my mouth."
3,Works if I can remember to put it on several times a day,"My daughter is 4, and as active as she is it tends to rub off if not applied at least 2 times a day. It dries quickly which is a plus. Some reviews have said they threw up... Wow, way over the top. It's a taste that stays in your mouth for an hour most, to remind your brain chewing your nails is disgusting. I have used this for 3 weeks straight and she is still biting her nails. Product works like its supposed to, expensive in my opinion, but maybe she's not ready to stop? I'll use all of the bottle and hopefully it will work over time."
5,Debt is Credit,"This is the 5th revision, the original was published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago in 1953. It was originally titled as, ""Debt-Jeckyl and Hyde."" It is interesting to note, on page 19 paragraph 4, about how the banks create New Money when a depositor's balance also rises when the depository institution extends credit-either by granting a loan to or buying securities from the depositor. In exchange for the note or security, the lending or investing institution credits the depositor's account or gives a check that can be deposited at yet another depository institution. In this case, no one else loses a deposit. The total of currency and checkable deposits-the money supply-is increased. New money has been brought into existence by expansion of depository institution credit. Such newly created funds are in addition to funds that all financial institutions provide in their operations as intermediaries between savers and users of savings."
2,Really gold?,"This well packaged plant arrived just 3 days after it was ordered. However, the plant label is much larger than the plant itself. For almost $10, I expect a more mature plant instead of a 2 inch baby. Perhaps it is actually gold..."
5,A remarkable novel,"2010A new law is passed.... All of America is thrown into complete turmoil...Unlikely heroes Fred Gamst and Brad McCullough must take on the full force of the powerful Capitalist party in an attempt to preserve democracy against those who would allow people to sell their vote to anyone willing to pay the right price.About the authorMichael P. Gerace is a lecturer in political science and economics at Northeastern University in Boston. His hobbies are researching international relations and history, and travel. This his first novel."
4,Fast paced and enjoyable,"I'm very interested in Tudor history, but at times I get bogged down and bored with the same old Henry VIII drama, as intriguing as it is. The sisters of old H are almost forgotten and I found this story very interesting.Margaret, Henry's older sis by two years, reminds me a lot of Henry, allowing her lust for a handsome young man to guide her no matter what the consequences may be. Plaidy did an excellent job of bringing that out in this story. I found myself pitying her, but at the same time thinking that she made unbelievable choices, not so unlike her brother. She never learned.Jean Plaidy made reading about Margaret enjoyable and I found myself absorbed for hours on end. I highly recommend this book for those still interested in the Tudor period, but wanting something other than the selfish King Henry VIII."
3,An Overly long text humanizes history,"Erasmus warned the royals about trying to create peace or empires through marriage. Certainly marrying the English princess to the Scottish king did not work that way in young Margaret's lifetime. Perhaps, as tutor to one of the illegitimate sons of James IV, it was Margaret whom Erasmus had in mind.This novel humanizes history as we see the events through the eyes of the 12 year old princess. She is clearly a pawn of her father and then of her brother, both of whom prey on her tender years with calls on her patriotism and piety. We never learn if Henry returns her jewels. I suspect he did not.In the same light, Margaret's son is her main concern, her daughter is not much mentioned until the end when it seems she had been in England most of the time.While it's a fast read there's a lot of excess verbiage. The book could be improved by editing it down by 1/3 or more."
3,Excellent Text but Difficult to Navigate on Kindle Fire,"I wanted something on my Kindle that I could keep with me at all times. I'm only out 99-cents, so not a big deal, but this has no linkable table of contents so navigating is nearly impossible. No link to each saint, no way to get to each daily saint/devotional without scrolling and bookmarking. The content on each saint is excellent, and much more than I've been able to get in the hardcover books I've bought so far. I will keep this and use it on my Kindle until I can find one a little more user-friendly. Again, good content, but I really would LOVE to see the Original and a good Table of Contents for this book."
3,Simplifies the Complexities of History,"This movie is loosely based on the life and work of Varian Fry, an American intellectual who went to Vichy France to save European cultural luminaries from fascist persecution and death. The movie simplifies a complex person and situation, and, as such, falls short of the true history. I do think William Hurt does a good job portraying Fry. I have shown this movie to history classes, but found the pacing is a little slow for most high school students (although a minority appreciated the fact that an American also played a role in saving Jews). To people interested in learning more about Varian Fry, I highly recommend Andy Marino's fascinating character study, A QUIET AMERICAN: THE SECRET WAR OF VARIAN FRY. To history teachers looking for good (and appropriate) films to show students on rescuers during the Holocaust, you might consider the RESCUERS: STORIES OF COURAGE series."
3,Programming Perl (2nd Edition) review,"This is the 4th book that I have purchased on the subject, and this book really should have been the first book that I bought. It breaks down many of the Perl concepts into simple-plan-english that are easy to understand. It provides more information on the principles that are briefly touched upon in the other books. I have only began reading/referencing this book; therefore I can only give it a 3 star rating at this point. As the book states, Perl is an ever-evolving language that would be hard to totally document in a single book, but I can appreciate the extents that the contributors have made to this publication."
3,"It's so-so until chapter 5, then it's chaos.","O'Reilly is notorious for taking the cheap road when it comes to writers, and you really feel it when you hit chapter 5. They seem to be spitting every last little detail about packages/mods at you all at once, rather than starting with basics and building up. All I want to do is the perl equivalent af a simple #include, and it's taken me 4 hours to get a ""hello world"" function to be called from another .pl file."
5,top notch reference,"great reference manual...it is all there, everything you need to know, if you can't find it, you don't know enough about perl to even be looking for it i would suggest the learning perl book for beginners though."
4,ok,"I chose this book because I want to learn to program in Perl. A release is valid, and the title of the mi friends"
2,A reference book for perl/unix experts only!,"Indispensible as a reference book, but a poor choice if you are just starting out with perl. The geeky attempts at humor and general tone of ""look how clever we are"" frequently get in the way of explaining the concepts at hand, apart from being very tiresome. Chapter 4 on references and nested data structures is particularly obscure."
2,"Bank's offer is random, does not consider odds!","The whole object of deal or no deal is that the bank's offer is a calculated factor between the lowest and highest numbers on the board. My husband prides himself on determining the bank's offer before they call because HE calculates in his head... something me or the kids don't do.Anyway, this game doesn't use that, you pick out a random card from a deck for the ""offer"".Thus the whole point of the game is void.Completely dumb.Also, it takes a long time to have to spread out all of the cards and then insert the dollar cards underneath them.I think an electronic version of the game is needed so it will automatically display the correct odds so the game can be played correctly, and this will also avoid the time it takes to set up each and every game with all the cards."
3,Three Stars,This book was neither great nor bad. It is the first Elle Haskell mystery that I read and was not impressed enough to warrant purchasing another. The story was very slow moving and the plot and developement of the characters were not enough to keep you engrossed in the story. For a very short book it took me a long time to complete.
5,cool,the blu ray really cleans up the old Planet of the apes collection. No more grainy static in the film. Very enjoyable
5,Awesome.,I accidentally shipped this to an old address and they gave me a refund then I ordered another one and it got here in time for Christmas! I'm very satisfied with the product and will order other DVDs again.
3,Missing scene - be warned,"I was shocked to learn that FOX has decided to entirely change the tone of the series by cutting a crucial scene from 'Battle for the Planet of the Apes'!If you've never seen the series, you won't miss it. But if you've been watching these films all your life - where was the scene where the radiated man and woman decide not to explode the Alpha Omega bomb, but decide to worship it? This leads (timeline-wise) directly to the mutants in 'Beneath the Planet of the Apes'.This has changed the entire tone of the series! The pre-destination has been tossed out for a feel-good ending!Is this only in the boxed set, or did FOX also cut the individual DVD release?Do the director, writer, and AP Jacobs' widow know about this?I love these movies, but as a DVD set this is a shame."
4,Great set!,"The first film is BY FAR the best of the lot, but the other films are fun to watch nonetheless. The case is awkward, but the book is high quality and the films look very good on bluray, considering their age. A hint on the rubber knobs that are indeed very annoying: twist the discs on and off. All older films should be given this treatment (despite this problematic presentation)."
2,"charles heston is only in one movie, 2 are good -I resold and the boxset is very flimspy","charles heston is only in one movie, 2 are good -I resold and the setthe box set is flimsy -- I say the set is worth [...] bucks very disappointedto learn Heston was not in all of them -- guess I am not the movie buff .."
2,A great series in a lackluster package,"Planet of the Apes deserves better treatment than this. I already bought the films on video and was willing to spend the extra cash to get my favorite films on DVD. But what is the point? None of the discs have any extra features---and knowing that deleted footage exists from especially Conquest and Battle one wonders why it wasn't included. The collectors who want to see that material are the very ones who would've been glad to shell out money for the DVDs. Sorry Fox, you'll have to do better than this one."
1,Two hours you will never get back.,"A talent of mine few people know about is that I can quite easily sit and look at a picture of Penélope Cruz for hours. I can, nearly as easily, listen to her squeaky voice, or observe her quirky ballerina-like mannerisms. This film really put this task to the test. I gave in towards the end and fast forwarded to see how it ended. Aside from beautiful Penélope Cruz, I found this movie simply unwatchable.Penélope Cruz plays a gifted cook from Bahia who suffers from motion sickness. She leaves her cheating husband and moves to San Francisco where she stars in a T.V. cooking show and makes men all over town insatiably hungry. You'll have to figure the rest out."
1,Tries so hard to be quirky,"This film was a real letdown. With a star as charismatic and charming as Penelope Cruz it's hard to make a truly unbearable movie. But director Fina Torres has just done that. The story about a woman who flees to San Francisco to escape from her miserable life in Brazil, this movie was full of possibilities.But it fails on every level. The romance is cliche. The comedy is so very predictable. And the movie tries so very hard to be quirky..but it ends up being annoying."
1,Terrible,Terrible movie. Not at all one that I would recommend to any body anywhere. I wish I had never watched it.
4,Fun and beautiful.... but dumb.,"This movie could've been a lot better and a lot less cheesy. Why the 4 star rating then? Well because despite the cheese, this movie is one of my favorites. It's fun and the scenery is absolutely AMAZING. The movie is also very bright and creates a beautiful atmosphere. The music is beautiful, and the passion is a reminder to us all to savour what our senses offer us.Cute show."
1,Bad Movie,"Dont waste your time or money on this movie. I thought because Penelope Cruz was in it, that it was guarantee.Its a crappy movie, the plot, the character lines are dreadful."
3,Woman on Top,"A Cute Movie full of Love and Magic~ I'm not a Penelope Cruz Fan at all. My Heart lays with Nicole Kidman~ However this movie is ""Fun, Clean, and full of Magic and Love ~~The soundtrack is really a must have."
1,DEVOid,"Devoid of originality. Anyone with a couple Devo or Cars albums doesn't need this CD. They will find any way possible to repackage old sounds as ""new"" since the children of today haven't bought anything older than themselves."
3,Wireless,"Works ok most of the time, but can cause laggyness during online game play.Seems to not startup with the new xbox experience."
1,long wait and doesn't work,"Unfortunately, after a long wait while my purchase was literally on a slow boat from China, the adapter doesn't work and I have to go to the trouble of sending it back. They say they will refund my money once they receive it, but that could be quite a while. I am feeling very concerned about online purchasing."
3,dose the job,its and okay adapter for the xbox 360just has some problemslike not working sometimesbut it works fine for me most of the timesi would reccomend getting the newer adapter
5,Great product.,"Small, simple, but excellent!Actually I don't play networked game so much, I use this thing mainly for receiving video streaming from my media center. It just works great! I like it."
1,Useless...,High priced for a simple task to do...the game adapter from linksys works better and more cheaper than this.
2,Xbox 360 wireless adapter,"The wireless adapter does what it is supposed to, but man are we getting ripped off by Microsoft or what? The Wii and the PS3 have wireless capabilities but you have to pay extra money to get them on the 360. And not a little extra money, a lot of extra money. This wireless adapter is way over-priced at $76.99 new from Amazon. But kudos to Amazon for having it cheaper than anywhere else at the time I bought it."
5,Great product!,"I've had this wireless adapter for a month and a half now and so far, so good! It's worked like a charm, and I like how it unobtrusively snaps right onto my 360 console. There are cheaper ways to connect your 360 to your wireless network, but there are none easier. I have no complaints."
5,worth the money,"We got this for our son for x-mas and he couldn't be happier with this. He hooked it up with no problem. It goes in the xbox just as if you're putting it in a computer usb port. We live in a 2,000 square foot home and his room is on the other side of the house and it works fine. So no need to get the one with the two prongs if you're worried that it won't reach the signal of your computer. He absolutely loves it. Don't spend the extra money at game stop or other high priced stores; it works just the same!"
5,A must have!,"The price is on the expensive side, for what it does, but it is definitely worth buying. Having the wireless enabled improves the entire system, along with making gameplay more enjoyable."
5,Works very well!,"I have a netgear router and I live in a country with crappy internet but this seems to work well and gives me a good connection 90% of the time. The other 10% of the time it is the fault of the IP. I recommend this product , no doubt."
1,Expensive did not work,"I bought this at the same time as my Xbox360 elite in March 2009. It did not work for me. I tried it with a netgear router then a brand new Linksys router n-class which was downwards compatible to the b & g. The only way I could connect was to wire in my xbox to my router. I could not get an answer out of Microsoft and when I tried the router companies they just blamed MS. If you can park your router near enough to wire in you should avoid buying this adapter. I am still not sure if it is the adapter or MS software in the xbox that is causing the problem I did not want to risk the money to buy another one and it was past 90 days before I tried it(my bad). If you are wondering I have setup a wireless network in my home with several computers with no problems and without reading the manuals, for this unit I read everything and downloaded all upgrades for the routers as well. Beware try it out right away and send it back if it fails for you too.-andre"
3,"Great product, but pricey and sometimes has connection problems!","This is a great product for connecting a xbox 360 to a wireless network! My xbox 360 is 2 rooms away from the wireless gateway I have! But sometimes I have connection problems, which is why i gave it 3 stars(and the fact that it is $100). Sometimes, it'll take one minute for it to connect! I will not pay for xbox live just to wait one minute for it to connect! and sometimes, it'll take longer or won't connect at all! But maybe this could be a problem caused by my home network!"
3,Wireless adapter,"The product overall seems to work pretty well. It was [...] on Amazon than in any retail store. That is really the best thing about it. Regardless, [...] for something that should cost [...] is insane, that is Microsofts doing, not Amazon. In fact most electric items are wireless capable out of the box."
1,you get what you pay for,"Well I thought that buying it off Amazon since it was cheaper was a good Idea, but I installed the adapter and it worked for five minutes and then it just stopped working. I would suggest just getting it from Walmart because then at least you can go get another one if it doesn't work, it might cost a few dollars more, but its worth the hassle of getting a broken one."
1,Did not find my network,"After reading some good reviews I purchased this thing. Well it never found my network and I even took the security off from the router and other ways too. Checked out the forums and tech support and found that a LOT of these were not working properly - the is so frustrating - Microsoft support was no help - so I decided to get a refund instead. I decided to try WIRED and that worked fine. So it looks like I'll be running a Cat5 cable underneath my floor to play online, what a pain."
2,Exensive and does not provide good connection,"As stated by many other reviewers, this item is too expensive. Microsoft should have included a built-in wireless antenna to eliminate the need for extra accessories, but they did not.More importantly, the connection quality is terrible. I have Netflix streaming on my Xbox 360 and the videos take up to five minutes to load. I thought that my Netgear wireless router has a small range, but the connection did not change even when I moved my router right next to the Xbox console! Overall, I am very dissatisfied but I need a wireless connection so I have no other option."
3,Not as good as I hoped,"I lost connection on this thing a lot of times. Whenever I was Idle for more than 5 minutes it would turn off. Maybe it's been updated since I had it but I've had a lot of problems with it. I'm sure the connection is better if you're close enough to your modem but distance does play more of a key with this than say, a computer's wireless adapter."
3,"Works, but alot more inexpensive ways to go","This is a good product, but like most Xbox 360 add ons is insanely overpriced.You can easily get a good router for much cheaper price. If your one that likes to spend money like its going out of style buy this product. If your on a budget then you might want to look at products like Linksys instead. They are alot more affordable and work just as well."
2,Xbox 360 Wireless Network Adapter,"I bought this adapter so that i wouldn't have to deal with the hassles of using wires to connect to Xbox Live. It has given me more problems than satisfaction since it connects to Xbox life, but doesn't let me download any Xbox demos, arcade games, or videos... worst of all most of the time it doesn't always connect to the Xbox Marketplace. Maybe its just my gateway or something but Neither Xbox life support or my Internet provider seem to know how to fix it.....oh yeah, I can play online with it."
4,Buy only if you can spare $99 and don't have the older Xbox WiFi adapter,"I'm shocked that the so called ""next-gen"" console isn't even WiFi enabled out of the box. This is crazy. Microsoft makes up the money lost on consoles with accessories like these.Very few people will have their Tv/Xbox near the computer and router. Hence most will need a WiFi adapter. Here's where microsoft makes its money charging $99 for an accessory that really should've been included with this next-gen console. Or sold for like $30.Anyways, I saved $99 by using the original Xbox WiFi adapter. It only does g not a but its working great. !My advise - if you have the original Xbox WiFi adapter, use that, else save your money."
3,Wireless Adapter,"Does what you expect it to, unlike the ""compatible"" one I had originally bought at the Best Buy that stopped working after a month and a half."
5,When will it end?,"I hope that it doesn't have to end. These books are some of the best I have read in so long that I can re-read them anytime I feel the urge, and believe me, I read them over and over again. David Eddings is such a great writer that I would like to see him continue writing for a long time."
5,Best one yet,"Well, yet another book in the series down, and this one is by far the best one yet. Good action, the outstanding dialogue continues, there's a lot that is, as far as I'm concerned, fairly original and unique that he presents us with here. Although he's not my favorite character I absolutely love the abilities and the characterization of Relg. And what a cliff-hanger of an ending. Great book, great series."
2,Not really up to the job!,"Very flimsy rack. Narrow openings, so as you push the ribs into the racks, each rack has a tendency to pop out of its anchor holes! It is way too fiddly and not robust enough for the job. I was very dissapointed with this product. Although it seems a good idea to get a collapsible rack, this one is just too much hassle. As you pull the cooked meat out, yes you guessed it, the thing falls apart."
3,"Starts of very rocky, ends very well","The start of this show is, honestly, not that good. After the first episode, I was ready to quit the entire show.After that, it gets better with every episode. As entertaining as the Doyle character was, the show gets infinitely better after his departure and the arrival of Wesley Wyndham Pryce (as the show progresses, Alexis Denisof shows time and again, especially with his dark turn near the end of Season 3, that he is the best actor on the entire series).The first season episodes are a mixed bag. There are some excellent ones but, overall, this isn't a part of the Angel/Buffy cycle that I would highly recommend except as a reason to get to the far superior second season."
4,Buffy the vampire slayer where are you?,"It's hard to remember when David Boreanaz was just another boy toy for Buffy the Vampire Slayer called Angel. A vampire with a soul. Now that was a new concept. So good in fact he got his own series which was fantastic for years. That is until the final episode which sort of fell short of expectations. But ALL those years were GREAT! And if anybody out there questions Boreanaz,s acting check out his latest HIT BONES. If you can, get the entire Angel 5 part set. How long did Buffy,s new TV series last this year? Like 10 minutes. Michelle maby you should have appeared in Angel's final episode after all."
4,Little River Band's debut album,"LRB's first album has great harmony vocals and some good guitar work. The fact that it has the original version of ""It's A Long Way There"" makes it worth the price, which is incredibly low considering this is an import. Other good songs are ""Meanwhile..."", ""Emma"", and ""I Know It""."
4,This is good stuff!,"This is a wonderful toner- I also use it to refresh tired, scratchy eyes (soak two cotton balls,apply 4-5 minutes) and just as a general refresher. Try it!"
4,Great toner,"I really haven't noticed much of a difference in pore size from using this product alone, though other products in the Pore Refining line work really well to this effect. What I love about this toner, though is that it doesn't dry out my skin at all, and it leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth. I do get fewer blackheads and blemishes when I use this product. Recommended."
1,"SD Alcohol #2 Ingredient?! Temporary ""Fix""","The number 2 ingredient in this toner is SD Alcohol which does a great job of immediately degreasing your skin, but in the long run, it will cause your oil glands to produce more oil to make up for the drying effect of the alcohol. I like that it has AHA and beta hydroxy acids, but looking for another toner without alcohol. Any suggestions? I've tried the Neutrogena alcohol free toner and need something a little stronger for my slightly oily, more acne prone skin."
2,My poor pores.,"Haven't seen a difference in pore size. I wasn't expecting to. I decided to purchase this product because the toner I usually buy wasn't available. Although it didn't work regarding my pores, it does give your face an extra clean."
4,This is OK,"Does what it says it will do. Been using it for years and have no complaints. For best results, use along with a moisturizer."
4,I have very large pores on and around ...,I have very large pores on and around my nose so I was excited about trying this out. I was amazed at the results. I could actually see a visible difference in their appearance. I was skeptical at first because I found in the ingredients that it contains alcohol and I was disappointed. My skin is very sensitive and I was afraid that it would dry out my skin. I used it every day for a week with no redness or dry patches. I love its smell -- real fruity and fresh. It left my skin feeling fresh and smooth without any dryness or tightness.
2,Missing frames,"It is unfortunate that the Criterion issue of Reed's film has several missing frames in the sequence in which Sonia Dresdel notices Bobby Henrey on the dangerous ledge. The British issue has exactly the same defect (as well as being inferior in every other way). Clearly both issues used the same damaged print. Otherwise, the American disc is up to the usual high Criterion standards. - Anthony Baker, Somerset, England"
1,Fallen Idol.,"Didn't want the VHS. I wanted the DVD, very disappointed especially as i couldn't send it back for a return.It cost me in total $50"
4,I find Mr.Byrd's debut to be refreshing and very melodic.,I have had the privelege of seeing Mr.Byrd live on many occasions- this album has been long awaited. Mr.Byrd's zest for playing and passion for the music is so apparent- just listen!
2,Couldn't get through it,"I too had heard an interview with the author and thought it would be very interesting to hear his story. Although many callers on the radio interview with the author were in disbelief of his stories, I believed him and was interested to hear a story of undercover work that was non-fiction. But after reading half the book I could not go further because it seemed to fictional to me. Kind of like a James Bond movie - if that's what you want, then you'll be satisfied. If you want believeble, you won't get it here in my opinion."
3,Found something that does not fall out of the ear...,The original I got with my s105 is not bad but I just bought another one also made by Samsung that works with s105 and v205 from ebay for about the same. It has an ear shaped plastic thing that goes around the ear and it does not fall off. Pretty neat and it's made by Samsung so the quality just as good.
3,Kind of a silly tracklist.,"This CD was purchased simply because I am a Britney fan and wanted the soundtrack to her movie. There were many more songs than this in the movie itself, but this is just the ""best of"" I suppose. I'm just going to review the Britney tracks on here. The ""I Love Rock 'N' Roll (Sing Along Karaoke Version) kind of pointless, but I still sung along, lol. The ""Overprotected"" remix they had was ok. It still doesn't change the fact that Overprotected is probably one of my lest favorite singles from Brit, but it's still great and the remix was fun! Overall, I like this product because it's Britney and it looks good on my shelf, but am I going to listen to this a lot and bring it along on super long road trips? No."
3,Roy Clark Bluegrass It's about time.,I love Roy Clark and have a lot of his music but this was not typical Roy Clark. I was not pleased with his part of it...TR
4,Sign language curriculum for kids,"If you are trying to learn sign language, this isn't the book for you. There is not a single picture of a word being signed in the entire book.It is not exactly ASL friendly. There are also no examples of ASL gloss. Words such as ""of, is, a, to, be..."" are included in vocabulary lists. The author explains that the book is meant to be used by either ASL, Pigin, See, or even Mannually Coded English users, and is not sign specific.If you are already fluent and wish to teach school aged children (the children must be able to read for some of the listed activities or games), this is a fairly good resource.There are suggested vocabulary lists and practice sentences, as well as suggested games to play, a few activities to copy and print for the group, and suggestions for reviewing past vocabulary lists. It is written in such a way that a fluent teacher should not have to spend a lot of time planning and producing lessons."
5,one of the funniest stand-up specials of recent memory,"I never knew Jamie Kennedy as a stand-up. He just seemed like a funny guy, who can act, but I guess he's been doing this awhile. Anyway, it's hilarious. His voices and characters are great. When he slams an audience member for correcting him in his act, to when he yells at a cameraman who drops a chair during the set, Jamie is one smart, funny dude. Get the DVD... Comedy Central cut out a bunch of good stuff at the end of the special. And the DVD extras are worth it."
2,get something else,I bought this book because I was in the simplify my life mode and wanted to read more about it. This book does not have what I was looking for and I did not have any take away from it. I usually fold the corner of the page when I read something that I thought was good stuff but I did not fold any corner at all.
1,Not much to begin with,"Lippe's book of rather weak maxims left me high and dry. ...her somewhat brief inner meanderings were continually punctuated with such things as a lecture on the rewards of cleaning out my clothes closet, or advice about how to prepare my wardrobe for the next work day, or lists of what to take when traveling...I expected something much more inspiring!In conclusion, she writes: ""I cannot claim that any of it (what she has recorded) is original..."" And herein is the author's own disclaimer."
3,Decent set - bad glue,"These pans have functioned fairly well. The pans have good weight, but the cookie sheet still warps slightly and ""pops"" with heat (goes back to normal after cooling). The non-stick coating is slightly above average and will last quite a while provided you do not use metal utensils and dry the bakeware thoroughly immediately after washing. If you allow it to air dry or use in the dishwasher, the water will annodize the metal and cause rusting and flaking of the coating. Overall, a very decent set."
2,Disappointing,"I was very anxious to read Francine Prose's latest novel because I loved ""Blue Angel"" so much. But ""A Changed Man"" was largely disappointing to me: I didn't care about any of the characters and I sped through the last third of the book just to have it be over. Prose is a magnificent writer and I'll certaily read future novels, but this one, in my opinion, just isn't as good as all the critics are claiming."
1,Thank God for 1/2 Price Books,"I sold the book the weekend afte my book club discussed it. It was horrible. I have never read a book where I couldn't identify or believe the narrator. But, that is what happened here. The ""insight"" that the narrator provided on the characters was trite and did nothing to help me like or even care about them. What I thought would be an insightful book about a ""changed man"" was a poorly written, unbelievable romance story with unlikeable characters."
2,based on joint family values,"The story is average and it is based on joint family values.The acting by Siddharth Randeria and Rajesh Solanki is significantly good but Niyati Dave steals the show with her graceful, resilient and evocative charisma.I look forward to more movies from director & Actor Siddharth Randeria in the future."
4,Looking for a book that is TOTALLY appropriate for the PROFESSIONAL Consultant? Seek no further!,"For the first time, and I do not know why, I have found a book that is full of relevant advice, common sense, and just good stuff all round! Since the start of my career as a consultant in 1989, and not finding anything like this, this book is going to revolutionize any consulting practice. A definite ""NEED TO"" book for ALL consultants who call themselves PROFESSIONAL. Allan, to you, just complements.... Will meet you somewhere along the path..."
2,Does not work,Does not work for my pontiac vibe 2003. This wire harness does not include the wire for turning on the remote amp so no audio is coming out of my stereo.Diagram I am following is here: [...]
4,Good budget price collection,A disc of songs and a disc of arias mostly in their original languages and mostly from the 30's and sounding pretty good. The Strauss Morgen from 39 is very beautiful. The remastering done by this company adds a little reverb to the recordings which takes a little getting used to. The Requiem includes all of Bjorling's music and the sound is pretty good for a 1940 live broadcast. The young Milanov sounds much better than on her recordings from the 50's even if her singing is the same. Moscona was a good bass. The Missa doesn't sound quite as good. The soloists often seem too far from the microphone. Kipnis comes across much more clearly than the others. Possibly as a result of the remastering process the brass section sounds noticeably off pitch. Nice six page bio of Bjorling included. The Strauss aria at the end of disc 1 was replaced by a recording of Verdi's Ingemisco
5,A Legend Remembered!,"This was without question the finest album by one of the trendsetters in the world of music.One of the founding fathers of thelegendary Beatles,Lennon left his mark with all phases of hismusic.Even today,32 years later this CD is still selling.Thisalbum has some excellent songs on it.You have ""Crippled Inside"",""Jealous Guy"",""Gimme Some Truth"",and""How Do You Sleep"".This lastsong was a shot at his fellow Beatle Paul McCartney.But the songthat has endured for the years is ""Imagine"".This song was a bestseller in the 1970's and is still selling today.This song isstill played in dentist's offices on instrumental music.""Imagine""has withstood the test of time.This is a fine album that you should own."
5,"Orginal was incredible, this is even more!","This CD was well-worth remastering! I have this album on vinyl, cassette, CD and now the 2000 remastered version. Like the Beatles, ""Yellow Submarine Songtrack"" and McCartney's ""Band On the Run"", John's ""Imagine"" is highly worth the money. It sounds like you're sitting in the studio with John and he's playing ""Imagine"", ""Oh Yoko"" and ""Crippled Inside"". Highly unbelievable and I would love to see more of this. Let's remaster ""All Things Must Pass"" next! Great job!"
5,Well Done Remastering and Remixing,"I always felt this CD should be remastered. The first time I listened to this new mix, I listened with headphones, and was very pleased. It doesn't sound so muddy, especially Gimme Some Truth. Well done. Forget Plastic Ono Band, how about remastering the Beatles catalog?"
4,Swan Song for a Beatle,"This is the last album John Lennon would make worth owning. A few of the songs seem ""dated"" due to their content-particularly ""Gimme Some Truth"" and ""I don't want to be a soldier""- and ""How do you sleep"" seems ironic coming from a man of ""peace"" who pretty much ignored his first son while involved in various moral infidelities. But still, this is a good album with some very good songs--and even the ""dated"" songs are still good. ""Imagine"" is easily the highlight, but ""Jealous Guy"", ""Oh My Love"", ""How?"" and ""Oh, Yoko"" are all very good songs. Sadly, this album and ""Plastic Ono Band"" are it for John Lennons post Beatles career-but these two are definitely worth owning."
2,A Few Bright Spots But Otherwise Overrated,"Being 41 years old, I have been a Beatles fan for practically all of my life. The amount of quality work McCartney and Lennon (Yes Yoko, I changed the sacred batting order. Deal with it!) churned out in the span of eight years was extraordinary. Though at the time friends, they must have been fiercely competitive and drove each other to achieve what they never would have achieved separately. This is evident in much of their solo work. Though both have had some nice moments, they have never done anything solo that has broken new ground. Though touched by the simple poetry of Imagine, I am thoroughly bored by the tune and question the longevity the song might have endured had Lennon's life not been so abrubtly ended. When I listen to ""How Do You Sleep"" I wonder what is was that McCartney did to piss Lennon off. It must have been pretty bad!"
3,Man this man needed the Lord,Some good songs Jealous guy is great and a great Lennon vocal one of his best next to nowere man. Imagine has a great piano and vocal but the lyricks. I cannot even imagine my life without the Lord Jesus so I pray that John came to know the Lord before he passed. GodBless
3,I found the cap on the tube hard ...,I found the cap on the tube hard to open and the gel flows out so much faster than the toothpaste. It's almost impossible to get the recommended equal amounts. The taste was okay. Other sensitivity toothpaste I've used seemed to do a better job providing relief on some of my cold-sensitive teeth.
3,Culture Shock,"Throughout the early 80's, Culture Club ruled the charts with their catchy music and energy. This is one of the many greatest hits albums ever released.The only difference in this collection, is that the band actually reuniteed on VH1 Storytellers in mid '98. The full storytellers performance is featured in this collection, including songs that weren't even on the show.Also, another collection of greatest hits is also here. Songs like Church of The Poison Mind, and It's A Miracle, still keeps listeners interested in their music. Although Boy George might not be the chameleon he used to be, his charm still bites up new listeners."
5,So...Furry.... Adorable!,"All I can say is, WOW! This plush is so great. Durable, furry, and cute! Best plush I'll ever have. The color of the fur is a nice dark blue. I use her as a pillow, but most of the time...I give her a big hug...Recommended to the MAX!"
4,"Cute little cube works fine, just a little tight.",I bought this to fiddle around with at work when I need a distraction from the grind. I am a decent cuber and can solve the full size cube consistantly between two and three minutes. This one takes me longer because of it size and stiffness. I have no use for it as a keychain so I removed the chain from mine. It does easily and inconspicuously fit in a pocket.
4,Tony Levin - Smooth Instrumental Music,"One thing I find interesting about Levin's solo album is that no two are alike. I own several and they are all very different from each other. ""Waters Of Eden"" is an album that indeed flows like water. The all instrumental disc could almost be classified as new age, although Levin is such a versatile musician that the music here has more to offer than typical new age fare. World music, classical, jazz and progressive rock all come into play with these compositions. The album never really rocks out, although there are a few funky bass lines here and there. Overall this is a very nice album from Levin. I have to be in the right mood for it, but it is a very nice set of music."
5,Got me up and running quickly...,"I was new to this technology when I first picked up the book. However, after reading a few chapters and leveraging the supporting code samples on the CD, I was able to start building solutions the first day."
5,Great book for all ages,"This is a simple yet fascinating book that explores in words and in drawings the construction of an English castle. The book follows a castle's construction from the initial ground work to the finishing touches and includes fascinating details about the inner workings of castle-building and the life in and around a castle.MacAuley is a gifted author, capable of explaining basic engineering and building techniques in language accessible to young readers. Even adults will learn something new about how castles were built and the day-to-day living experiences within the environs of a castle. What makes this book so special are, of course, MacAuley's superb drawings. Every page is richly decorated with MacAuley's detailed, hand-drawn, black-and-white sketches. Even as an adult, I find it amazing to look at these drawings and it is no surprise that children find these drawings simply riveting."
1,In the context of storage unit history...,"This has got to be the most cheaply made, flimsy, breakable, undependable, piece of trash that has ever been passed off as a storage unit. Please buy this product, if but only to return it to underscore its poor quality to its retailers, distributors, and manufacturers."
1,bootleg,"look at that, some advances from the actual tunnel rats album. i thought thump records was legit, though?interesting."
2,"Earnest, But Unconvincing","The philosophies and doctrines of the Catholic religion are here outlined in a simple and straightforward manner. Drawing heavily upon an extensive collection of ancient writings, including the Bible, Brantl presents his case for Catholicism in an earnest, if unconvincing, fashion.After beginning with an explanation of the philosophy of God, Brantl outlines the basic beliefs of Catholicism, including the Advent, Incarnation, and Pentecost. Three chapters expound on the Catholic way of life, including their faith, their transformation in Christ, and their affirmation. Brantl then sums up with a concluding chapter on the ""last things"" - death, judgement, purgatory, hell, and heaven.For those looking for a brief summation of the Catholic religion, this may be a good place to start. Included are transcriptions of the Mass on the Feast of the Holy Trinity, as well as numerous other ceremonies."
3,The best you're likely to do,This brief study on the mysterious pre-Roman Ogham script from Ireland comes in an Irish/English language format. The dearth of literature on this ancient writing system makes this so-so account about the best book one is likely to find.
5,3 Star CD with a 5 Star Song On It!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"If you have never heard Luther work his magic on ""When I Need You"", (yes, IT'S A REMAKE) then buy this CD. It's worth the price of the CD!!!!!! You'll enjoy ""Get It Right"", ""I Know"", ""Isn't There Someone"" and ""Are You Mad At Me?"".But, clearly the 5 star song of this CD is ""When I Need You""!!@!!!!!??!>@@@!!@##!!!!!!!!"
3,nice idea but...,"it is a gamble to make a hole in the tubing. if not ""perfect"" you get a dribble along with your mist.we used it on our patio in florida and it does its job but 1/4 or so of the nozzles leak which likely affects the pressure at the remaining nozzles. difficulties are part me and part materials but exist."
5,"Force Outboards, All Engines, 1984-99 (Seloc Marine Tune-Up and Repair Manuals)","Quakity product, quick shipping"
4,Karoke for Grandchildren,"Ordered for two grandaughters. The machine arrived promptly and ready to use on Christmas morning. No problems and very easy to set up and operate. The girls (ages 9 and 11)loved it. Things they would have liked even better: a larger screen. Things I would have liked: a second microphone should be included as an option (it has two outlets). I had to order another hoping it would work with the equipment. I'm not certain this would be a good choice for adult use, but for children it's great."
2,Doesn't help sensitivity,"Hoped fluoride-free, sensitive toothpaste would help sensitivity, but it didn't. Room temperature paste bothers sensitive teeth. Disappointed. Would not recommend."
5,A Must for any DOOL fan,"This book really informed me about all the plot lines from the past, in order to understand the present. Along with the synopsis of the plot, it also contained sections recounting all the families, couples and weddings that have touched Salem throughout the years. There were also interviews with Kritian Alfonso, Peter Reckell and Diedra Hall, just to name a few. This book will be a memorable keepsake for any die-hard DOOL fan."
5,Wayland Drew is a highly under rated author.,I'm so glad to finally find this book again after losing it. Drew is simply an amazing author and truly has a grip on how to write a true fairy tale. Mr. Drew taught my grade 12 english class and some of his writing rubbed off on me. Unfortunately he died of Lou Garrigs disease a few months ago. He will be truely missed and so will his writing. If you get the chance learn more about this man and the other titles he has written.
3,Pretty good stuff,"I have been a fan of Rockapella since ""Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?"" (kinda embarassing to be in high school and rush home to see a kid's show). Rockapella has always been good, but mostly they are outstanding. This CD is good, but I would have to recommend Primer or Rockapella (1997) as their best CDs. But, if you really want to get to know Rockapella, see them live. I have not missed a single concert they have had in the LA area in the last 5 years. The great thing about this group, is that they don't take themselves too seriously, and it is so refreshing to kind of have ""your own band"" (if you understand what I mean)."
5,Rockapella - another great one,"I loved Don't Tell Me You Do, it may be my favorite vocal album of all time. I eagerly awaited R2 and I am not disappointed. Though I feel that DTMYD is stronger overall, there are still some great tunes on this one especially: People Change. In summary a highly recommended go buy. I also echo the sentiment - Thank God for Rockapella - ugh! for the Boy Bands"
5,Another great bag from Tamrac,"I have had smaller Tamrac bags for my last two cameras which were normal sized point and shoot cameras. I like the combination of features of the Tamrac bags, so when I upgraded to a Canon SX30IS camera, I wanted a Tamrac bag for that camera too.I had to read though charts specifying sizes, and look at the measurements associated with the camera and the cases, then I chose the Tamrac 5515. I'm not used to having a real camera with a lens cap, but this bag makes it nice to carry. I like the combination quick release clip and zipper on the main compartment. The side compartments are sized well to hold extra memory cards, my charger and a spare battery.I wish there was also a piece of Velcro to hold the main flap down, but I could always add a piece if it bothers me that much. I'm quite happy with this bag for my SX30IS, even though it's almost too big for my camera. I'd rather have it slightly too large instead of being too small."
5,Very Delicious Temple book,"Haven't yet hit too much of the content, but it's a wonderful publication in it's photography and high-quality publication value... Great pictures, great detail, and from what I see, the discussion of the temple architeture and sculpture looks equally promising. Definitely more of an art and architecture book about temples, than a book about Hinduism it's temples."
4,"Neutrogena Body Clear Body Wash, Salicylic Acid Acne ...","Neutrogena Body Clear Body Wash, Salicylic Acid Acne Treatment turned out to be a great cleanser. I have a little acne on my chest and it didn't break out fully in the five days that I've used this product and I don't think it will. The body wash foamed up nicely using a body puff and has a very light clean smell. This product is perfect for the spring and summer months when my shoulders, back, and chest are more likely to see the light of day! I think a month of this product would give even better results. I plan on continuing to use it."
3,"Works alright, but not wonderfully.","I bought this product because I have body acne on my shoulders, chest, and back. I am relatively active, working out several times a week and walking to/from school about 1/2 a mile each way. I have found that this product works about the same as a regular body wash, such as Axe or Dial, without giving any special acne-fighting advantage. What I finally did find to help out with some of my body acne is a face wash that was much stronger than most normal acne washes. This could be just me, but I found that this product was not better than any typical, regular body wash."
2,Slim padded useless seat,Sorry I bought this product. There are much better padded seats out there because I have seen them at the arena but couldn't find them. This one is thinly padded foam with straps holding back rest to the seat cushion which only makes it complicated to use. If it was more thickly padded both seat and back and held together with zippered closure it would be much improved. One could store a blanket (and cow bell) inside when needed. I should have returned them (2). Oh well.'
2,Stiff and unwieldy,"I am disappointed in this seat and, though I did not return it, I have stopped using it. I wanted to use it as a portable stiffener for my very soft couch, as I have a bad shoulder. But it is so covered in straps, velcro, and awkward corners, it is virtually impossible to use for that purpose. I may give it to my husband to take to ball games this Spring."
5,It came super fast!,I ordered my chair the day before president's day and It arrived that Monday. I was shocked. I was a little nervous when i tried to put this chair together. The instructions only provided my with pictures but no words. I was trying to install the wheels but i did not realize that i just had to push down hard enough until they slid in. To make sure that I was doing it right I had to look online for instructions. I did not find this model on the Lorell site. I had to use directions for a similar model. The directions provided the pictures but words also. Once I put my chair together. I was proud and I sat in it and it was comfy! I have no complaints so far.
4,Great chair,"The chair is really great but unfortunately mine came with a little piece broken, due to bad packaging. I really need it soon so I let it go - with a better packaging would get 5 star.Very comfortable, the adjustments are awesome."
2,Hole in the chair,"Well, there was a hole in the chair when I got it, its on the bottom so it isn't noticable just a bummer that its new and there is a hole there :(. I didnt return it because i would then have to take it apart and put it back in the box and we all know how fitting things back in the box goes. I've had this chair for a while now and it isn't bad. Had it not have a hole in it i would have given it a five since its pretty sturdy and affordable. I expect it to still be lasting for a few more years!"
1,Buyer Beware...Customer Service Non-Existent,"When I received the chair is was short one caster. I contacted parts@sprich.com as the instructions said to do. Four weeks later and I still have not received my part. I called the 800 number they have listed and even during stated business hours I only get a voice mail and my calls are never returned. The chair is nice, but if you have any problems with it beware that customer service is non-existent. I wish retailers would not sell products of companies that do not stand behind what they sell and do not practice at least a minimum level of customer service. It appears I now will have to return the whole chair over being short a caster."
4,As good as chairs that cost 4 times as much,"I've never spent so much money on an office chair, but I got the value of a much more expensive chair for this price. My son had recommended it because he bought a few for his business. I can work in it for hours without discomfort. The only downside is that there are not instructions for how to adjust the angles of the seat bottom and the back. The way you do it, is you have the adjustment handles in an ""up"" position and put the relevant chair part (seat, back) at the angle that you want. Then push the corresponding level down to lock into position.I'm glad I bought this chair--it gives fantastic lower back support and the variety of positions it can have makes it suitable for all body types and all office situations (like an unlevel floor) I love the fact that the armrests are short enough to allow the chair to fit comfortably under the desk."
2,not a comfortable chair,"This chair is easy to put together - I spent about 25 minutes to do it. However, when I started adjusting the back tilt tension and the seating tilt, I realized that the back support tension was very weak, almost none. No good back support when there is not good amount of tilt tension. It doesn't worth the money and it's not a good product."
2,Not for a long ride sadle,"Complete plastic contraction, witch is okay... but:1. Seat can't go lower & it's impossible to remove rollers to get it a bit down because the pipe will not aloud to (too long).2. Quality of plastic is very solid but the curve of the back-frame is not so comfy.3. Mesh material is stretched already after only 2 months of very light use (I'm 5.7"" 125 lbs and sitting upright position most of the time).4. The under-elbow arms are too hard with almost no cushioning.5. Seat made out of thin fabric with a very little cushioning also (I'm using a foam pillow to soften it).Overall = for this kinda discomfort...price must be twice cheaper. About bells & whistles... who needs it, if comfort is THE priority #1 for any type of chair.Just think about; nobody in the whole industry trying to do the comfort of the home/office chair, that would be equal or even close to the comport of the cheapest car driver-seat. Folks can travel in for day's. I wonder why?"
2,Seat back-rest has no strength,"I hate this chair. It assembles easily, however the seat back will travel in the locked position. Everything is assembled correctly and tight, I'm 195lbs. The arm rests are wobbly, and the tilt feature is extremely limiting. Don't buy this chair, keep browsing. I've owned it for over a year, and am extremely disappointed with it."
5,gift for xmas,"glad i thought of this, and so is my daughter ans son in law. highly recommended. an office at home is often not well set up for computer time. makes a good and unusual gift"
1,"arrived damaged, in a destroyed box","The chair arrived damaged, in a destroyed box. Otherwise it looked like a nice and decently made chair for the price."
4,Go getta,"This is a really good office chair for the price, easy to install and multiple adjustments for a comfortable sitting and working. I have been checking computers chairs for a while in stores and either they were out of my budget or too crappy. Although I am a bit skeptical buying furniture online, I decided to go with the risk and turned out to be a good decision."
4,An interesting approach,"This story of three friends gone their seperate ways after an accident made me relate to my own experiences as a youth out of college. Each of the main characters (all named David) begin to lead different lives and lose touch with one another (as well as their original ideals) as they adapt to their new surroundings. Each David experiences new encounters with interesting and somewhat ironic characters that help shape their personalities and attitudes. One of the most intriguing things about this book is the style in which the author tells the story through the Davids. Not your typical coming of age fiction, a suggested reading by this reviewer."
4,Metal Gets A Facelift,"Alice In Chains debut album came along right as hair metal was dying and just before grunge was about to hit. As a result, it contains both of these elements and provides a hint at what this brilliant band was capable of. ""We Die Young"" starts off with grinding downtuned riff by guitarist Jerry Cantrell that would later become standard. ""Man In The Box"" features singer Layne Stayley wailing about censorship. Creepy, dissonant numbers like ""Love,Hate,Love"" and ""Confusion"" sound like Godsmack's primer. Stayley begins examining his heroin problem on the 80's metal-ish ""Put You Down"" and ""Real Thing""(where he asks his rehab doctor if he can ""borrow 50 bucks""). A decidedly dark affair that today sounds downright cheery compared to the band's later albums."
4,A great debut from a great band.,"Although not as good as Dirt or Jar of Flies, it's still a great album, and contains one of AIC's best songs ever, Man in the Box. But my opinion is that Facelift is more of a metal album than a grunge album, excluding Man in the Box. Another thing is that while practically all of the songs from Dirt are at least good(excluding the pointless bonus track), Facelift has a few mediocre songs. The only thing that is better about Facelift is that Layne Staley's vocals and Jerry Cantrall's guitar playing are both superior to what's on Dirt. Noneoftheless, it's still a great album that all you metal or grunge lovers should have in your collection."
5,2 the person who thinks this is worse than godsmack,"u idiot!!Godsmack tries 2 copy alice in chains style very much. hell they got their name from a song of thier ""dirt"" cd. Godsmack is no wear neat as good and talented as AIC and never will b. R.I.P. Layne Staley"
5,Man I love this cd,This CD has never gotten old I could listen to itall day and night. I Just wish Jerry Cantrell threw in more blistering Guitar solos'.
5,An enjoyable treasury and giftbook especially for horse racing enthusiasts,"Compiled by the staff of Blood-Horse Publications, Horse Racing's Top 100 Moments is a nostalgic compilation of great instances in the history of the sport of kings. Each two-page spread of this trade paperback is devoted to memorable occasions ranging from Cigar's historic victory of the first Dubai World Cup, to the very first race call as conceived by George Schilling in the mid-20's, to the broadcast of Man o' War's funeral, each great moment is described in clear prose and illustrated with vintage black-and-white and color photographs. An enjoyable treasury and giftbook especially for horse racing enthusiasts."
2,as big as a penny!!!,"From the pictures it looks like a great watch, but the pics are decieving, the face of the watch is only the size of a penny, if that. A bit small (which looks feminine) for a 9 yr old boy. Otherwise nice watch"
1,Very cheap.,"This would have been a fun little trick, but it was very cheaply made and more often than not does not work. In addition, it was not put together correctly and it took a while to figure out how to set it up, as you had to go inside and thread a tiny line through a cylinder.I got this because I thought it would be like a nice wooden version I saw once, but it was not. It was made of very cheap plastic.However, I can't blame the company too much, because it was also very inexpensive."
3,clunky,"for the price, I can't complain a lot. Really needed a tool rest that would get inside the bowls but this one is really ""clunky"". It's just so large and thick in the wrong areas and it's difficult to make it work within your bowl. But, like I said, for the price I really can't complain too much. I don't use it very much but when I do I have to appreciate having it. If you have the money get something more gracefully contoured and not so thick."
2,Impractical,"I've learned a lot of languages during my lifetime and have therefore read a lot of books in this area. This one (the first 5 chapters) is the worst I've read. The content itself might be accurate and good by itself but it's not a good book for learning Swahili as a beginner. It doesn't contain any practical texts to read to practice what you've just learned in each chapter, just a lot of words out of context. Not even simple conversations in the first chapters!I bought a children's book to fill the gap and I might use this one as a reference book."
5,Neon Clock is a great gift,"I purchased this clock for my daughter who loves everything Disney. It was delivered very fast and she loved it. Haven't seen anything like it in the stores. You can turn the neon light off and on when you want so, it could serve as a nightlight. Very cute!"
4,Does it's job,What can I say? This is a pretty basic product. I've had it for a couple of months and so far so good. Only time will tell though because even the cheapest manifold works well for a while. What I really like is that it appears to be all brass so no plastic parts to crack. The yellow looks like it's just a grip.
5,Bangin' CD,"While the tracks themselves are very braindead (4 beats/break), the kicking bass makes you want to just get up and start dancing. When you can't enjoy the LA nightlife, this CD brings it from the clubs to your home stereo. Great for parties, play this baby on full blast and dance the night away."
1,Fooled Me...,"I bought this book as a high school senior looking to improve upon my already pretty good score on the SAT reasoning. My desire going into the test was simply to raise my score on the math section and keep the others around the same. However, what I discovered is that the first time i took the test, WITHOUT STUDYING, I fared better than I did with this book. Now, I may have been setting my sights too high, but this book promises an INCREASE of about 100 points by using their special techniques. What I found out, however, is that it did change my score by about that much, but in the OPPOSITE DIRECTION!! I am thoroughly disappointed, as I know that I'm not stupid... my application to Rice University is already in and I'm planning to apply to Georgetown, Stanford, Duke, and the University of California. I certainly hope that this doesn't jeopardize my standing with these colleges, but please, DON'T think that this book is worth the money... it's not."
5,"Comfy, better than the rubber one.","Bought this when the rubber strap for my Garmin 305 broke after only a month of use. It's more comfortable and seems to handle the bulk of the unit a little better. Been working fine for the last few weeks, we'll see how it does on the funk test after a few months, that's the usual downside of these kinds of straps."
5,Great for Garmin 305,This worked great for my 305. Easy to put on and no problem with the charger fiting behind the band. And it fits my small wrist better than the original band. Very happy with purchase.
4,Great Replacement Strap for my Garmin 305 Forerunner,Easy to attach and I like it better than my old plastic wrist strap. It is comfortable and very secure. I would recommend.
3,"Clever, but not a revelation","The woman who wrote this book is clearly quite clever. Her associations of men to birds is truly amazing. There are quite a diverse number of birds out there, from eagles to doves to peacocks. This book is entertaining, but I can't say it changed much about the men in my life (or how I deal with them). I'd buy it for the humor, but not for the self-help aspect."
4,Cowboys of yesteryear!,"I bought this DVD being an Ed Wood fan, but also I love the old 50's westerns. Both of these films have your standard plot, so your not getting anything that new, but it's nice to look back on a simpler time."
5,Parece Que Fue Ayer Album,I bought this CD and it is some of the most beautiful music I have ever heard. It's very romantic. They sing with so much feeling. It's incredible.
2,I was sent a Cd that skipped,"This item was sent promptly but the Cd skipped. I was very disappointed. It was teaching a meditation class, and the CD starting skipping on the third track."
1,Great~,This product was exactly as offered. The music is soothing and relazing. Would recommend it for anyone seeking this type of music!!
1,tiresome loops,"the loops on this release are tiresome, and i never really get an opportunity to crawl out from the space bubble. perhaps a repusion or brigther death now or merzbow cover would have lent some life to this release. there is no relief to be found here. No hearing aide, no justice, no peace."
5,Rock you may have missed,"I bought this album in the Fall of 1977. I had never heard anything by UFO. I grew to like every song on it. ""Too Hot to Handle"" is one of the best. ""Gettin' Ready"" and ""Electric Phase"" are also standouts. ""Just Another Suicide"" has got some great lead guitar, especially in the middle. ""Lights Out"" never did sound as good on vinyl as it does on CD. Michael Schenker is an awesome guitarist. This album does have a distinctive 70's sound. And I will say it doesn't sound as good now as it did then. I didn't get listened out on this album for a whole year and in it's time it was great."
4,A classic release from the classic line up!,"A lot of people claim that ""Lights out"" from 1977 is UFO at their very best. Well, I don't know about that. This album has of course some great as well as classic numbers like the frantic title track ""Lights out"" and the album's opener: ""Too hot to handle"". But to say that this release is better than say ""Phenomenon"" (1974) or ""Force it"" (1975) might not be true. I think as long as Michael Schenker was/is a member, the band is great. And that means that the more recent albums like ""Walk on water"", ""Covenant"" and ""Sharks"" are indeed as fine as the stuff from the mid 1970's. ""Lights out"" is a very even album and the songs are of rather the same calibre right through. There's no real low point, but on the other hand I wouldn't say that the material is world class either. Anyway, this is a very fine example of great vintage hard rock."
5,Too Hot To Handle!,"This was the first time I heard Michael Schenker, and have been a fan ever since. His phenomenal playing on the title track, 'Too Hot', and 'Electric Phaze' are just pure rock and roll. This is a great album, and a must have for any UFO/Schenker fan. This album still stands up after all these years...love it!"
4,There Would Be No Lauryn Hill Without Camille Yarbrough,"The Iron Pot Cooker is a landmark historical album that has been reissued by Vanguard Records. The centerpiece is ""Take Yo' Praise,"" a song that was sampled and made hugely famous by Fatboy Slim. The original version bubbles and smolders, haunting in its passion. Shades of Stevie Wonder support a woman who at times is proud, angry and insightful. A couple of tracks show their age and are a challenge to listen to, but by and large, the album is an important precursor to hip-hop and R&B."
3,Can't close door,This is a great opener for opening the door from the outside but if I go out the garage door I can't use it to close the door so I have to have a remote with me. I can't imagine why they would have one that doesn't have a close button on it.
1,Worked great. For only 6 months.,"Worked fine when I had it installed in the summer. Tried to reset my pin a few months later and it wouldn't work. Couldn't reprogram, reset, or use my original PIN. Very unhappy with the item."
2,Works Well But Door Hinge Will Break - Good Battery Life,"This was easy to setup and program with my existing Genie opener. The lighted buttons make it easy to see at night. I would have give this 5 stars except for one problem. The door seems to fall off sometimes. Sometimes when lifting the door, it comes off in your hand. Other times, it won't close because it's binding on the hinge. It needs to be reseated and then it will close.20FEB2013 UPDATE: The door hinge eventually broke from wear after 2 years. I tried to super glue the hinge back together but that failed after a few weeks. It seems to be a design/engineering issue with the hinge and plastic used as it cannot bear the pressure/force/movement of the cover through the entire range of motion on opening. On the positive side, I only needed to replace the battery once and the keys still work on the first press."
3,"I've heard better, I've heard worse.","This is another one of those terror ebm artist who try to sound like Wumpscut without sounding like Wumpscut, and the end result is just that. Bad Wumpscut! Heah. There are a couple nifty tracks on this album, but nothing to get excited about. The cover art sucks to. Anyaways, this cheap thrill isn't the worst album of the year, but unless this CD sells for under five bucks used, I wouldn't bother. There are far better CD's to check out....like Wumpscut! ;0"
1,My brand new 748 is WARPED!,"I bought a brand new Johnson 748 EcoTech? Laminated Hardwood Brass Bound Level today. If you look at Johnson's web site you'll see they tout this model as ""Less likely to warp due to our high-tech, laminating process."" Well, guess what folks, mine was warped right out of the box! Isn't that special? I called Johnson (because it's supposed to have a LIFETIME WARRANTY) and was told I'd have to ship it to them (at my expense) so they could take a look at it. If they found it to be defective, they would repair or replace it and ship it back to me. What's wrong with this picture? Why should I have to pay to ship them back a DEFECTIVE product? BUYER BEWARE! If you really want a Johnson 748, but it from a place where you can visually inspect it FIRST!"
3,Very general.,"This book is very generalized, with average pictures. It is best suited to mechanics with good skills already. My advice is don't buy an older boat unless you know a lot about mechanical repairs already, or have a mechanic who will work on the older boats."
4,"Good, but doesn't beat the first book","I'm so glad that there was a sequel. This book was tense, exciting, and another page turner, but it was lacking some of the passion that the first book so beautifully depicted."
5,Tatiana and Alexander,This is THE BEST SERIES OF ALL TIME. If you have not read these books than you are doing yourself a huge diservice. Words cannot express how wonderful and amazing these books are. These are a definite must read for anyone and everyone. If I could I would give them a million stars. Five just isn't enough.
3,Tatiana and Alexander,"I am enjoying this, I read the Bronze Horseman. It is a little too much overlap, needing to fill the pages, not sure if I will read #3, but we will see when I finish. Worth the read though."
2,Big Disapointment,"3/4 of this story is a repeat of book 1. Very little happens until you get to the end. I felt like this story was completely unrealistic, unlike book 1 and 3 in the series. I felt like this was a filler book for the author to make more money. You really don't need this story... 1 and 3 in the series are good enough."
4,Can't get enough angst.,"Spent so much of the book wondering when will they be back together that I blanked out on what was really going on. Still a great read, and can't wait to start ""Summer Garden""."
3,Just ok,I was a bit disapointed with this book. I read the first part (Bronze Horseman) years ago and it was great. I could not put the book down. And with this one... it was just all right. I do not regret I read it and I will definitely read the third part just so I could find out what happened later. But was not too happy with this story. Found it boring at times. I felt like Tatiana was not the Tatiana that was portrayed in the first part. But that is just my opinion. Everyone is entitled to one....
3,Disappointing results from a fine author,"Small Town is a long, complex, mystery, with many interesting characters.A skilled writer, such as Block, could wrap a good novel around severalof them. Some of the characters are well developed and interesting inthis novel. Unfortunately, the whole is not just less than the sum of itsparts, the whole is less than some of its parts. Over and over, I keptimagining Block with two thoughts. One, ""I want to do something completelydifferent."" Perhaps he has, and perhaps that makes him happy, but ""SmallTown"" did not make me happy. If I was not already a fan, I would avoid him.Two, ""I've got all these snippets of dialog, character, plot, and NY triviathat I've not been able to work into any of my other books, so I'll dumpthem all into one big book. There is good writing in many of the episodes,but the book does not work well. I'll be back for more Block, but it willbe in spite of ""Small Town."""
4,Murder and sex !,"This is an intriguing murder mystery story involving a group of New Yorkers following the terrible days of 9/11. A mass murderer is carrying out seemingly random killings, mostly in Manhattan and a very varied group of people find themselves connected by the murders. Be prepared to delve into the world of dominating and subservient sex, given in great detail and into the mind of a formerly model-citizen type of man, whose life has been torn apart by 9/11 and who sees his revenge as perfectly logical.I found it to be a fascinating (in a terrible way)story and one which a reader would find difficult to put down."
1,Not Block's Best Effort,"Normally what I expect from a Lawrence Block book is a plot-driven book with interesting characters. Small Town is a character-driven book, with a meandering plot that moves very slowly. And every one of the characters in this book is unlikeable. The book is filled with long stretches of these characters musings and they just extremely tedious. Even the kinky sex, which you would expect would spice things up, is so over-wrought that it too becomes tedious after a while.I listened to this as an audio book, and I kept plowing through it thinking it would get better since it was after all a Lawrence Block book. It didn't, and it was a relief when it finally ended."
2,dissapointing,"you know how in lots of big books there is one storyline that you don't care a lot about, and secretly think you have to wade through to get to the storylines you do are excited about? Well, about 2/3 of the way through SMALL TOWN I felt that all of the storylines were that one. None of them were bad per se, but none of them captured me and I kept waiting for it to get better until the book ended and I realized that it wasn't getting better.I'm a huge Lawrence Block fan, but this book just didn't do much for me..."
2,Cherokee Nation,I saw a guy reading this book on an airplane. I asked him if the book is about a nationalist Native American movement. He just looked at me uncomprehendingly.
1,send in the aricept,"where is the sultry woman of the 70's whose songs I listened to repeatedly as a young adult and who ""didnt have time for the pain""...this album is a snoozer and listening to it caused me pain ..I cant believe that carly has sung herself out..please carly ""torch"" us again..I know you have it in you!!!!"
4,Bushnell window mount and mini tripod,"This is a good product for the money. The swival action is a little rough at first but smooths out with use. It seperates into two parts, the window mount/swival head is convienently compact and so is best suited for a small to medium size camera..."
3,"Decent value, questionable build quality","I bought this to use as a tripod from my car window. For it's price, it does a great job. Be careful with how much you tighten the joints, however, as the ""ball"" portion of the mount seems to have worked itself lose from the weld."
1,ho hum........,"this late eighty s tale of the pun man teaming up with an assassins guild is ok , but suffers greatly when you compare it to todays storylines, not much humour, or action for that matter , happen in this tale, but artist j zeffino does a great job on it (years later he would do an other graphic novel with acclaimed punisher writer chuck dixson),zeffino makes every thing look dark and gritty.jo duffy on the other hand seems to miss the point of the punisher writing him as far to much of a deep thinker,when we all know frank is definatly not that! but with all that it still is an enjoyable read if not excatly smart one!! a must for die hards only!!"
2,"Not a very good book, or a very good manifesto","A guy who's a little too in love with his writing ""voice"" preaches endlessly to the choir, assuming all the while that his audience already knows almost as much as he does about fixing bikes. Beginner mechanics and, for that matter, just about anyone who isn't already a fan of Tracy's fanzine writing would be much better off going with Lennard Zinn's books."
2,Great potential plot disappointingally developed,"The plot is pretty good and there are some great descriptions of the effect that Sarin has on humans (although the same description is repeated several times), but . . . The plot moves way to fast and there is no character development. A realistic plot but weakly written. The research was lacking a little. I live in Salt Lake City, grew up here, and will be involved in emergency operations at the Olympic games and I found a lot of the geography to be incorrect (e.g. the opening ceremonies taking place at the Delta Center instead of Rice Stadium, the ski events at ""Snow Mountain"" in Cottonwood Canyon instead of at Snow Basin in Ogden, where is Copper County?). I get the impression that the author got the idea for the story and was in a hurry to get the book out before the games, rather than actually writing a good novel. I wish Clancy had written it because the plot had so much potential."
5,A convincing book for life change,"This is an excellent source of both nutritional information and recipes that support this life changing way of eating. It sites sources from non-industrialized lifestyles of nutrition, which we can learn from. It holds hands very closely to the Maker's Diet by Dr. Jordon Rubin. This is truly a great source of nutritional information."
2,[...] Not a Good Diet,"[....]I like to cook but it literally did take all weekend to make just a few recipes. I am a generally healthy person with no major health or digestive problems, these recipes made me feel extremely bloated and ill. I do believe in biochemical individuality and I feel perhaps this type of diet works well for people with a certain type of genetic makeup and digestive system. I am obviously not of this physical type. That said, I still think this is a terrible book because the recipes have such amazingly long prep times. Get real. This is the modern world."
5,"The new ""kitchen bible""",Excellent book. Very informative and has a vast amount of recipes and techniques. I use this book often and see myself doing so for many years.
5,Great book,"Packed full of great information for EVERYone seekeing to eat healthier and to cook healthier for their family, no matter the size."
1,no recipes,"I was hoping for some recipes and all it had was talking about the diet, which I have read about elsewhere. NO Recipes! Would like to return it."
3,Meat and more meat,"Some of the points are very well taken--promoting raw milk and natural butter over margarine, for example. But promoting such a heavy meat based diet is hardly what the world needs right now. The author lacks an understanding of the energetic properties of meat and how it is hyper-stimulating to the system and promotes aggression. Not to mention that the sedentary western lifestyle hardly merits a diet rich in meats."
4,Wish I had it years ago.,"I am enjoying this book so much at the moment. I wish I had it years ago. I'm not one for following recipes exactly, but these I do. I have confidence that they will turn out great. So far every sauce, main dish, cultured veg. has turned out wonderful. Am looking forward to each new recipe I see. Has opened up a new world for my family & on top of everything else we're feeling better."
5,Will be sent to friends!,"This book has raised a number of questions for my husband's dietician, who wants him on a ow cholesterol diet. This book repeats what I have read before -- high serum cholesterol is not a problem; it is a symptom. It begs the reader to question his/her physician and/or dietician as to whether said person is giving GOOD advice or POLITICALLY CORRECT advice. Read this book for a wake-up call!"
5,nourishing for the mind,This is an incredible book for anyone that wants to get back to the basics. A real eye opener of how things used to be. great information great recipies.
5,Great Book,"This book is a great reference guide and has some great recipes. It was recommended to me and I am happy it was, now I will recommend it to others!"
3,Capote Capers,"The pictureReese Capote Capers, 3.5-Ounce Jars (Pack of 12)of this item showed Non-Pareil capers packed in balsamic vinegar. What was shipped were actually the larger, less desirable Capote capers. Plus they were packed in white vinegar and not balsamic as pictured.But the capers are of very good quality nevertheless. Just wasn't what I expected."
4,Films of Audrey Hepburn,"This is one of the better ""Films of"" entries in the Citadel collection. It also---for some unknown reason----one of the hardest to find. The narrative comments are clear and helpful, and the photos are wonderful. In these books, the reader should not be seeking a library-quality biographical review of the subject. But this book certainly is a worthy addition for a serious moviegoer to own."
3,It cleans my skin well and it has ...,"It cleans my skin well and it has a strong tingle. I had to use a lotion after this product, or my skin felt too dry. I don't think this is a product I need, but for people with oily skin I'd think it could be helpful."
3,Delta tool rest,"I did not like the tool rest because the surface was too large, but I ground off the lower part and then it was fine."
2,Pretty on the surface,"Pros: not much stands out. It's bluetooth wireless. It's an Apple product and has that ""dipped in unicorn tears"" vibe, if that's important to you.Cons: it eats batteries faster than any wireless keyboard I've owned (three others). It's a very noisy ""clack, clack"" keyboard. Some people like that, I prefer quieter (though not silent). Once it gets dirty, it will stay dirty. You can't clean it once stuff gets inside the clear case. Being Bluetooth, it's always loosing contact with my Mac Mini and it's not quick and simple to reconnect."
2,"I love Macs, but this doesn't work","I got a wireless keyboard with my new iMac back in '06 and it died a month later. Well, it didn't die, it just didn't connect wirelessly to the computer. There's not much you can do when that happens except stare at the little blinking light under it and wonder what it means. So, it got replaced and here I am two years later and guess what? The other wireless keyboard doesn't connect either now! So it's averaging out for me that I need to buy a new one every year. It's time to move on to something else, with a wire."
4,It works great. I wonder if I really needed it.,"First the technical. The bluetooth connection to Mac OS X is unbelievably easy to setup. If you have the keyboard turned on (yes it has a power switch and needs batteries) prior to booting up, the keyboard is immediately ready to use (for passwords). The feel of the keyboard is similar to recent products from Apple.Now the non-technical. I thought that this would be a fantastic addition to my system, giving me greater flexiblity. Not really. Other than losing the cable and occasionally moving the keyboard to a new area on my desk, it usually sits right where my old keyboard was. It also doesn't feel right sitting on my lap.Apple scores again with a truly plug and play component. At present, I don't know if the benefit outweights the cost. Maybe I will grow to love it over time."
1,Bleh,"Ok, it looks nice. Sadly, that's all I have good to say about it. On the flip side of the coin:1) it feels like mush - if you type a lot, don't get this thing2) it eats batteries - I type about 5 pages a day, it goes through a set of four every month or so3) it collects dirt - all keyboards do, but this one has an ""open top"" that makes it happen a lot faster4) it stops working - mine's been dead for a few days now, it simply won't sync upGet an iceKey or an MS Internet Keyboard. Losing a single wire isn't worth it."
5,If only everything was this dependable...,"This keyboard was included with my iMac, I have had absolutely no problems at all, instant setup, flawless working always. Battery life for me has been more than amazing, this is the computer I use for work, ie. 8am to 5pm daily including Saturdays, and the keyboard has been running on the same excellent Energizer batteries that came with it for almost 7 months! Leave it to Apple to decide to ""make you spring"" the extra $4 or $5 for real batteries instead of reducing their price and bundling some cheap useless batteries that will get you running for a month or two.I turn it off at night though, because I also put it away in storage because I work in a factory and there's lots of dust around, the keyboard got quite dirty at some point but a nice thorough cleaning left if sparkling new, this means one thing = excellent materials and quality."
5,Excelente libro,Un montón de información sobre controles y puntos de presión útiles en la lucha en el suelo.Muy elaborado y con buenas fotos e ilustraciones.Buen trabajo.
2,The depth of book for exam is not enough.,"Do not expect to pass exam with this book. Comparing with book for VB, this book cover only 50 percent for exam."
3,"Brilliant start, the rest is boring","This is the story of the relationships of a young faculty in a midwestern university with his uncle, a professor at the same university, with a sort of an ex-girlfriend, with whom he has a child, and with his parents, who live in Paris (where he grew up).The first 70 pages or so of this novel are brilliant. Saul Bellow's gift for telling stories is depicted in them in both - plot and structure. He uses the English language and grammar as a musician uses notes to compose a beautiful and flowing piece of music.Only after the first 70 pages the book becomes boring. The story is dragged and the beautiful usage of English turns into a demonstration of technique that doesn't really serve anything.The verdict: Read the brilliant first 70 pages and then move to your next book..."
3,Splinter Cell wannabe not so bad really,"It is clear from the start that this game is designed to attract Splinter Cell fans. There are a few differences & obvious similarities--the main character is a photojournalist who discovers a Russian nuclear conspiracy and must act to save the civilized world...Also, our hero must acquire weapons and make gadgets (from items found) as well as use stealth & non-lethal ammo to help him eliminate the bad guys. Make no mistake, this is NO Splinter Cell, but I found it entertaining and looked forward to playing it to its conclusion. This game will likely be lost in the holiday game shuffle, so I'd recommend rescuing it from the bargain bin!"
5,Another great book by Debbie Macomber,"If you have read any of Debbie Macomber's books, you will enjoy this one. Her stories of the Three Angels that are periodically sent to Earth to help people are just great. I really enjoy everything Debbie writes."
5,It was a good book to read,I enjoyed this book. It was light and feel good book. when it ended I kind wanted a little more.
5,entertaining read,I knew when she named the 3 angels (from Psalms) I was going to like her wit.Very funny and uplifting.
5,I love Debbie Macomber.,Another good read by Debbie! She is my favorite author next to Nora Roberts and the one I read when I need to feel good.
3,This product was very easy to use. The ...,"This product was very easy to use. The instructions were simple and easy to follow. Once on, the sticker didn't bother me. The final results seemed to be very sporadic and unpredictable. On one occasion it worked very well and two other times it seemed to make the condition worse."
3,Old Fashioned,I didn't really like this film because it is very old and kind of choppy. Some others may like it though.
4,Horno incense burner,"Horno Oven Burner With Pinon Natural Wood Incense - Incienso De Santa Feworks just fine with pinon incense; however, the cedar incense doesn't burn well at all(keeps going out; hard to keep lit)."
4,"Decent, but largely recycled material...","This album is another in the litany of repackaged, ""greatest hits"" albums that Petra's labels have produced over the years, and this one was largely unnecessary. Several of these songs have appeared on other similar collections. And with only ten songs, this is rather unsubstantial.Nonetheless, it is Petra, so the music and lyrics are good stuff. If you want to listen to some driving worship music from the 1980's and early 1990's, this is a good place to start. I'd recommend other Petra albums before this one, but it's still a good one to have, and I listen to it often."
2,Won't Work Out of the Box,"The tubing that comes with this fountain doesn't match the pump provided, nor is it long enough to stretch from the pump to the top of the fountain pot. Fortunately, a good friend took the tubing and pump to the local hardware store. He bought longer tubing of the correct size and also clamps to hold the connections in place. Now it runs just fine. Not something you just plug-and-run, sorry to say. But once you have it up and running, it works fine. You can change the type of ""burble"" noise it produces with rock placed in the splash tank. (Now I have to figure out what plants to put in the pot itself.)"
3,risky business,Rosemary Rogers tells a great story but definately on the soft porn for graphic content.
3,not a big fan,"I tried the cream and the oil, it seems to me that the oil is much more efficient (and I like the smell better)well, it's safer to bring a cream tube than a oil bottle in vacation, but at home it's oil, oil, oil ;)"
1,Not the product advertised...,"Not the product advertised, not the product I ordered. This is a different cream from the same company, Weleda, and is often confused but I thought Amazon would have better quality control and service than this. The packaging is different (big flag) and, more importantly, the ingredients are very different."
3,Ehhh!!! This one not so much,"It took me a lot longer to finish this book ""Valor In The Ashes"" than it did the ones prior to it. I can best describe it as being like watching reruns on TV. There was way to much reference to the books that came before and to me that is just fill. I found myself speed reading by the time I got to the center of the book. I hope the next in the series is better, if not I probably will throw in the towel and read something else."
4,fine project by this inspired family band,"I really enjoyed this new CD by Cherryholmes Family, put out on the Skaggs Family label. Though better than their earlier, independent releases, the only flaw I find in the CD is the overly compressed sound on some of the groups high harmonies. Regardless, it is one of the strongest Bluegrass CDs to come out this year."
4,"Today, they are better...",I saw Holmes familiy a couple of weeks in Switzerland. Performance was outstanding. The CD is from 2005 and music have not same quality like in the live performance because the family members are better today than two years ago. (-> they started to play music in 1999!)For me a little bit too much singing and to less instrumental. I am looking forward to the second CD.
3,Cherryholmes CD,"The CD was alright, the family harmonizes well together, but the mother (I believe) sounds better blended in with the rest of the group than by herself. Other than that the songs are nice, some songs are good toe-tapping catchy tunes."
4,More than just a horror story&#65533;,"This book is about more than just vampires. It's about a time and a place; the confused, lost society of the 80's. The House of Caine is about people searching for meaning, order and identity in that era. What makes this book interesting is reading between the lines, looking for the metaphors planted there by the author. Ken Eulo is known for giving his tales multiple meanings, and this book does not disappoint."
2,Kind of a crap TV movie,"A blend of fantasy and sci-fi give this little indie what little lift it has. The theme is a search for the meaning of life. There's a bargain with the devil, of course, and that comprises most of the movie. The acting is pretty bad throughout, and many of the scenes were shot on the same streets in Manhattan's meatpacking district before it became gentrified. This is a pre-9/11 film, so we also see the World Trade towers. I found the whole thing a bit tedious."
1,This is horrible,"I really, really, do not like this CD at all. In fact, I plan on throwing it out tonight. Whatever you do, do not spend $12 on this steaming pile of doody."
1,The Greediest Band on the Planet,"The DMB is great. The music is sophisticated and well-played by this tight band. The lyrics have more often than not been utter nonsense. The main problem is that these guys recycle their songs more than any band I've ever seen. How long are their loyal fans going to keep buying the same material? All of this from yet another ""activist"" musician, Dave Matthews. Save the planet? I agree. Save your money and skip another DMB rehash? Absolutely!"
4,Another Fisher Price hit here!,"We bought this dollhouse for my youngest daughter's first birthday. I wanted something she could grow into since we have passed down so many baby toys from my older two kids. This is a really great house! So far it seems very sturdy. The people are chunky and easy to hold. I want to order extra furniture sets in the future as it doesn't come with much. I DO like that it comes with a potty. I don't know why, but many dollhouses we see don't come with them, and I think it would be nice to have that as a model for potty training. Especially since so many dollhouses are focused on that 2-4 year age range.We did order the Caucasion family through an offer at the Fisher Price website. You can print out a form and mail in your UPC code from this house to get the family ethnicity you want for free! Now we have two families to play with and a great house! Even my 7 year old and 4 year old love playing with it, and they have dollhouses of their own!"
5,A haunting and moody expression of these standards,"Although I'm only 42 yrs old, I have been impacted by this album. As a child I was drawn to the haunting melodies and unusual arrangements. My parents used to play this album often (since they knew some of the musicians)and although I was a Beatles fan, something about these arrangements has always stayed with me. I am incredibly impressed with Bill Mathieu's ability. I looked for ""Standards"" in CD format for years with no luck and finally went out and bought a turntable (which these days are hard to find) just to be able to listen to my parents old album. Highly recommended if you really appreciate music's intricate delicacies."
1,Not Worth The Price,"Who doesn't love saving money, right? I figured, plug this bad boy into my GPS and discounts and deals would start coming out of the woodwork. Sure, $1.07 quadrillion is a bit pricey, but hey, you've got to spend money to save money right? Wrong. $0.50 off at I-Hop. Save $2.00 on a set of tires at Les Schwab. Buy one pie, get one free at Marie Calendar's. At this rate, I'll never make my $1.07 quad back. You work hard all your life to save up 17 times the gross domestic product of every country on earth, and then the darned thing won't even pay for itself before the sun explodes. Take my advice: save your money and buy something else."
2,"Good Product, Perhaps But Won't Fit nuvi 880 MicroSD Slot","I ordered the SaversGuide at the same time I ordered my nuvi 880, received both items promptly. I was disappointed in that the SaversGuide software was on a regular SD memory card. Unfortunately, the slot in the nuvi 880 only accepts a MicroSD card. The return process was extremely easy, and my account was promptly credited with the return.If the SaversGuide was available on a MicroSD card, I would order one.NOTE: While the online information indicates the card is good for one year, the one I got had an expiration date of July 31, 2009, only ten months from the date I ordered it."
5,Great for World Lit teachers!,"If you are a teacher of World Lit. and include Indian Lit. in your curriculum, this Bollywood movie is a great diversion (whether you show parts or all of it). The literature generally focuses on the harsh life of India, but this movie shows the whimsy and how the wealthy lived (live?). The costuming, dancing, singing are great, and the movie includes some of the rituals unfamiliar to our students. My students (seniors) always enjoy watching Paheli despite the fact that they have to read subtitles!!"
1,annoying advertisements,I recently purchased a 2005 edition of Paheli (EROS International) from an Amazon vendor that has annoying advertisements inserted throughout the film. The ads are inserted at dramatic points and you can only fast forward through them - if you attempt to skip over them it takes you to the next scene. Has anyone else had this problem? (I've never had this with any other bollywood film - EROS or otherwise).
5,Who will be platnum princess?,"The final vol. of P.P.Y.(Petite Princess Yucie), I would have to say it's the mostintreging of them all. Friend ships begome stronger, relashenship grow stronger, you she gust how stronger friendship can turly be. Thats all your going to get out of me, so buy the dvd and injoy. I strongly advise you to get the dvd, infact just get them all.Animtion=4.5Comady=4Drama=4action=4.5adventure=4.5Romace=4.5So I give this dvd a 4.5."
2,Broke after first use,"At first I was happy with this product because it was de-thaching my lawn well. However, before I was even finished, the springs broke, so now I have a half finished lawn. Might work still be useful if I can find better quality springs."
2,Meh,"This may work okay in a pinch, but, it's performance was less than impressive. It mounted up easily enough with the multitude of hardware that was included, though at the end of the day it really didn't remove much thatch and did a great job scalping the lawn. After running the blade at a slow speed (mower loping at idle) in an inconspicuous place, I borrowed a Bluebird dethatcher to do the whole lawn with. There was no comparison.I guess that if you really want something to beat up the grass and possibly pull some of the thatch out this blade might work fine, though, I was less than impressed by it. Save your money."
1,Not worth the money,"This is an excellent item (if you want to shred your lawn)! It ""may"" work if you were able to set your mower RPMs to idle speed. My mower does not have a throttle so it just shredded my lawn when set low enough to actually get to the thatch."
2,This is not disco,I was fooled into buying this by the title. This is dance electronic music - very electronic and harsh.
4,As always a great book!,"I love any and everything Anne Bishop writes. This series isn't as good as her other series, but still very good read."
5,HILARIOUS game!,"I LOVE this game- it's one of my favorites. Good to play with your family, or friends (I'm in my upper-20's and my friends love this game). Would be harder for younger kids because there are a lot of pop culture references from the 80's and 90's. My only complaint is that the clay dries out quickly."
5,Da Bomb,"My daughter who is 11 finds the game entertaining and fun. Although some of the cards are things she doesn't know she can still play the game simply by stringing clues together. The only thing we don't like is the cranium pop light should make a noise when time is up, not just stop blinking."
5,Great Game but...,"Now that hasbro has you can not get replacment cards...this game is huge cult hit, big at college, and no new cards."
2,Ritzer's Sociological Theory - Is it Worthwhile?,"While Ritzer gives a synopsis of many of the major theorists in this study, the treatments are incomplete. This study should provide a ""jumping off"" place for further study on the individual theorists discussed.While the reader may get a brief discription of major theorists it is not higly recommended for serious scholarly study. In other words, ""dabblers"" in sociology may find it useful."
3,Great series... but watch out..,"Steven Spielberg Presents Taken(product with longer run time)So, unbeknownst to me at the time of me buying this product, I didn't realize there were two versions of this series. The one I bought is missing about 15-20 minutes. As I was watching the series I noticed that as they did recaps of the episodes that certain scenes were omitted. So this irritates me. I recommend paying attention to what you buy and check the run time prior to buying."
3,STRANGE IF NOT ENTERTAINING,"NOT A BAD BOOK. ENTERTAING WITH A TWISTED HUMOR TO IT. I DOES HELP TO KNOW THE STORY LINES HE HAS TAKEN FROM FOR THIS BOOK. THE WIZARD OF OZ, 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA AND ISLAND OF DR. MORROW. THE LATTER ONE IS THE READER SHOULD BE FAMILARE WITH TO UNDERSTAND THE HUMOR OF THE STORY. I WOULN'T RATE LANSDALE BEST BUT DEFFINITLY HIS MOST BIZZARE. ICLUDES EVERYONE FROM WILD BILL TO FRANKENSTEINS MONSTER."
2,confused mess,"I'm usually a sucker for all things Sherlockian. I loved Young Sherlock Holmes, Murder By Decree, The Seven Percent Solution, A Study In Terror.. but I didn't care for this ""Holmes"" movie. Where's Sherlock? He ain't here! They didn't seem to know what they were doing when they put this together. Somebody saw From Hell too many times and combined that with James Bond and forgot to put Sherlock Holmes in the movie."
2,okay,"Case of Evil is okay. It's not really Holmes, but it's got it's moments. I liked the cast. Holmes fans will probably be dissapointed. Non-fans of Holmes won't probably watch it. It all plays like a missed opportunity. Who knows who this was made for, but it could have been worse."
1,PIEKENBROCK'S POPPYCOCK!,"I'm afraid I must take exception with Ryan Piekenbrock's review of this sorry mess! Far from Sherlock's best, CASE OF EVIL is closer to CONAN THE BARBARIAN than CONAN DOYLE. Piekenbrock's review is rife with pithy and pretentious posturing in a sorry attempt to paint a Picasso with little more than good intentions and a pail of panda piss; the only mystery with CASE OF EVIL is why anyone would bother watching the thing..."
5,Really fun and informative,"I bought one these guys' other books about the Palm, and was glad to see the same format for an MP3 book. They tell you everything about burning, ripping, players, software, Web radio stations, and even legal stuff about MP3. They do these hilarious point/counterpoint arguements like they did in the Palm book -- very funny, guys! Oh and the reason I bought this book is there's stuff for bands and musicians about getting your stuff distributed on the net and making money from it. Rip the cover off, though, cuz that girl is WEIRD-LOOKING!"
4,Very good book on a difficult subject,"Synchronicity has long been a subject of much fascination but also much confusion as generally it is handled more in a poetic than a scientific way. A strength of Combs and Hollands' book is its bold use of new science to try to move toward the adequate answer to the question of how synchronicity works in scientific as well as experiential terms. Here, as with his classic work on consciousness The Radiance of Being -- hands down one of the best on this subject -- Allan Combs displays why he has gained a reputation as one of the most firmly grounded of researchers who can also bring difficult concepts to life with the rare skill of an Arthur Koestler."
2,"interesting issues, but confusing and unsound","I was waiting for some intersting insights on how synchronicity accounts for threshold leaps in complex systems, and what place does it take overall from scientific prespective. I really struggled with the unstructured, swing-like style of the book. The example with Jung and the beattle must have been repeated more than 10 times. The language was awful, thoughts flying back and forth, ignoring the titles of chapters. Some of the concepts are facinating, but if anything, this book turns me away from synchronicity, because of its incoherence. This kind of writing is not scientific enough. The authors should have written this book in the style of 'Chaos' or 'Complexity'. It is sad that book on such interesting subject is written in such a way."
2,Disappointed,"Not as described? Needed this for school and now I have the wrong edition , not a good way to start the second quarter !"
4,Noticeable Enhancement,"I purchased this antenna for use with my Superadio. It does provide s noticeable improvement over reception without the antenna. In an area with high levels of interference, this antenna does a good job of cutting through the high pitch whistle. It also does boost the strength of distant signals, but it is no replacement for a good radio with a ferrite antenna."
3,Works ok but not great,"I bought this to take to the office so I can listen to AM radio. Without it, I was unable to get anything but with this product I can get one of two favorite stations. One station still won't come in and the one that does come in has a lot of static and whirring noise and I have to take breaks from going crazy. So I guess it works as advertised but I was really hoping for better results."
1,Did Not Work In My Area,"I was jazzed to see all the glowing reviews, but, it did not improve the AM reception in my area (San Jose, CA) at all."
2,not strong enough,I purchased this antenna thinking it would allow me to pick-up a station in Tuscon Az. I live in Phoenix Az. I moved it around all over the house.....dialed the antenna.....so forth and so on. No reception. Radio worked fine out on my pation but not in house. Seemed a waist of money but my husband says keep it. Don't know why but I did.
1,I am sorry I purchased it,"My (relatively cheap) stereo came with an AM radio antenae that plugged into the back. The Terk AM Antenna has two wires, not a plug. The instructions indicated by placing the antenna near my stereo I would get a benefit. No such luck. I do not know if it would have worked better had I been able to plug it in. I returned it, but the postage to me and to return it was more than half the cost of the antenna."
4,"Worked well if ""connected""","I work in a building framed with metal studs. AM and a lot of FM reception is terrible.I first tried this antenna via the inductive coupling (I.e. no wire). Not a chance, not even any extra noise.As soon as I connected the wires and tuned the antenna, the AM station came in perfectly.Overall, it seems to work great. Would I buy it again? Probably, although it would have been nice if the inductive coupling worked for my application. I had to monkey with the wires to connect them to my radio, so it wasn't exactly plug and play. My radio has two male connectors. The antenna wiring is setup for a female antenna connection on the radio side of things."
5,Phil,"The Terk Indoor AM Antenna worked great after some experimentation. Initially I connected it to my stereo system/entertainment center; it helped with local station reception but did nothing for reception of distant stations. Next I set it on a kitchen counter next to (but not connected to) a clock-radio and it worked better, but I noticed interference when I charged my cell-phone near it. So I moved it and the clock-radio away from electronic equipment and near a window. I think near a window is more important than away from electronic equipment. Now the distant stations I listen to are clear and static-free especially when I tune the antenna to the frequency of the distant station. Money well spent."
3,So-so improvement,"This antenna made a minor improvement in the AM reception for the stations I have trouble with. I am considering returning it, but not yet decided."
1,Just as bad as the 10th edition ....,"This has all the same sample questions and practice exam questions as the 10th edition. However, it did clean up many of the 10th edtion's editing mistakes, though some mistakes are still present. There are also a few incorrect problems in there as well, so watch out. Overall, this book is poorly edited, but it is the only thing I have found to use for studying purposes. If you already have the 10th edition, don't waste your money on this garbage. Check the library or in-store model first, don't buy unless you absolutely have to."
3,It's OK,"The book is basically alot of sample questions. It's in three sections: arithmetic reasoning, verbal reasoning, and investigative reasoning. I purchased this book for the IRS Criminal Investigation Tea Exam and beginning this year they do not test the arithmetic reasoning anymore. The verbal reasoning questions were much much easier than the real thing. The book is cheap so I would recommend purchasing it just to get an idea of what kind of questions they ask, but overall I found the questions to be too easy to what the exam asked."
2,Don't Buy It,"This book makes the test seem extremely easy. It is not. If you have other options, don't buy this book. I don't think any of these people have ever actually taken the test."
5,Best CFL timer period,"I bought this after using Intermatic for years. However, as time changes so do the bulbs. Using incandescent bulbs or CFL bulbs with this unit works great. Intermatic brand only works with incandescent bulbs. Working great after 1 year after installation."
5,High Quality Switch,"I needed a way to automatically switch my porch light on at night, and off during the day. I gave up trying to wire-in a photosensor to light. This product accomplishes what I need. It's a nice, high quality switch. It's easy to install and and easy to set the timer. The switch works with my compact flourescent bulbs, as advertised. Shipping from Swylite is very fast. As others have noted, the only (minor) drawback is how the wires are attached on right of the unit, rather than the back. This can make for a tight fit depending on your electrical box. I'm very happy with this switch and highly recommend it."
4,"Snap to install, program, and it works with CFL","Took less than 30 minutes to replace my X10 timer. I replaced my lightswith CFL to save energy but found my X10 doesn't work with CFLs.I must say though that my Radio Shack X10 was 10+ years old and was stillworking great. Anyway, the instructions are clear for 3-way switch andit is simple to program. It works fine with CFLs. I have 4 CFLs whichare 9 watts each that are controlled by this timer. Yes it is a tightfit but not impossible. I hope it is built to last."
3,Gondry,"This DVD is pretty sweet. There is a good amount of interesting, entertaining material and I enjoy watching it."
3,Excellent...if it weren't for the glitch...,"This dvd is awesome. If you're reading these reviews it's quite obvious that you know the genius of Gondry.however an annoying fact (and the reason for me docking two stars) is some of the dvd's were released glitchy, so that you can't toggle the proper menu; you have to sit through all the videos on the dvd to get through them all. Wonderful the first time around. Infinitely annoying subsequent times."
1,"Well, She looks 5 Star on the CD cover.",2 Great Songs to cover on it.Wonderful Christmas Time- Paul McCartneyLast Christmas- WHAM!But they are pretty well butchered by her singing/whoever mixed the songs. THATS UNACCEPTABLE.
1,AAAAHHH!!!,"This album is truly terrifying. When I first saw the cover of it, with Hilary looking as if she's about to pull a chainsaw out of one of those ribbony boxes and kill us all, I knew I was in trouble.I'm sorry to say, but I don't think that our queen Hilary Duff has quite the type of talent for the music business. If she insists on staying in the spotlight, I really think that she should stick to acting (though apparantly the only character she knows how to play is a ""dorky"" girl that the hot guy has a secret crush on) and stay faaaar away from singing. It's just that she can't carry a note, and she seems like she's talking a whole lot more than actually SINGING. Not to mention that her voice is entirely computerized throught the whole bloody album!Come on, is this the best that anyone can come up with anymore?? The world really is coming to an end......But if you're looking for a good CD for Christmas, I highly reccomend the Trans-Siberian Orchestra. Now THAT'S some holiday music."
1,She [sings?],"Personally, I think Hilary is great on Lizzie Maguire, and Sang ""I cant Wait"" really good. Its horible. On, all the songs she tries to sing high, but sounds awful. Britney spears sounds better than her, and i hate Britney.Dont waste your money buying this...this cd.I dont even think it should have one star"
1,HOLD ME WHILE I GAG!!,this stupid girl ruined alot of great christmas songs and payed the company oodls of cash to write horrible if u can call it that songs god people she cant sing and your still sopporting her by buying her crap
1,Oh No Girl,Oh lord this girl can not sing.She hurts my ears this CD is the worst I would rather hear a dog howl the hear her again.God blessed her with acting but no singing.Don't WASTE your money on this trust me!
1,Not RECEIVED,"As of Sunday, January 29, 2006, these goods have NOT arrived? When will they arrive? Could you follow up asap please.regards,T Davies"
3,"EXCELLENT MUSIC, DAMAGED CASE.",Due to computer problems my review is late andI was unable to file a complaint.The Hillary Duff Santa Claus Lane CD is excellent music.But the CD jewel case was received damaged and craacked.I replaced it with another jewel case.It appears to have been damaged prior to shipping.In the future your quality control needs more attention.Dennis T.
1,GET A LIFE GUYS WHO ENJOY THIS CD,"Any guy/boy who listens to hillary duff needs a life, and i pity any guy who is even wanting to buy this CD...it's hillary duff!!!"
3,HOT CHICK BAD SOUND,"Hilary is hot I'll give her that, but she can't sing or dance. I guess she sounds alright, but she needs to take some singing lessons. Or she could just stick to acting. She is great at that and she is the hottest actress by far on Disney. She plays a 12 year old or somthin but you know she's really like 15 or 16. I wonder if shes single."
3,good cd:bad singer,"I loved this cd!! The songs were good and put me in a christmasy mood but Hilary Duff isn't a good singer. She mostly talks in her songs and they put people who can sing in the background. It's nothing against Hilary, I like her, she's a good actor and I like her show but I think she's only good at acting."
5,Original Duff,"This CD is eaisly Hilarys best. This is original Duff, not that computerized crap that they market these days. This is the only CD on the market with her true voice. It is a classic and can be played through over and over again. Its pure pop fun!!!!!!"
2,~Alright~,"Hilary is really talented but i think she should stick with acting. or just choose one and if its going to be singing then she really needs help. she was doing fine until she started singing, i mean its not like AHH! ITS HORRIBLE, its alright its just like everyone else is saying, its pretty bad. if you want to listen to something better i reccomend A*Teens, they are so cool and nothing is better well LeAnn Rimes too but i think your looking for Disney or Pop music."
3,Some new Christmas songs that are great,I watch the Lizzie McGuire show all the time and love it! I saw Hilarys music video on Disney and thought wow I didnt know she can sing! I thought Santa Claus Lane was a good song then I saw the music video for Tell me a Story with lil Romeo. I dont really care for him that much but its a great song so that got me to buy it. She really does have a great voice and the other songs like Last Christmas are really good. I think the new songs by her are better then the old ones. She sounds better with her stuff. I think its great for young kids and maybe some teens for them to get them in the Christmas mood! Happy Hoildays everyone!
2,CUT- BUT STILL A TREAT,"Why in the world would Warner Bros. issue a cut print of this title when a full print is available. With its Widescreen presentation you would think they would find the uncut version, especially with its hefty pricetag. The scene cut is the spear in the Cyclop's eye aftermath where he pulls it out and cries. A nifty scene that is in all prints I have seen, so why not here. Shame on you Warner's.Well lo and behold Warner's did correct the problem I mentioned here of which I was correct on the initial release. Go ahead a buy the corrected copy- it is great!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Cyclops restored,"Ok, I just bought The Cyclops in the end of March, 2011 and it did indeed have the scene restored. Now we can watch Bert I Gordon's ""masterpiece"" in all its glory!"
1,How the British supposedly saved the world,"How can anyone produce a documentary about the allied campaigns to liberate North Africa, Italy, and France without once mentioning General George S. Patton? And when the subject turns to the Battle of the Bulge, this documentary presents a Wehrmacht turned back thanks to the heroic efforts of the British led by the ever fearless military genius General Bernard Montgomery. Patton didn't even merit a footnote, and that's enough for this documentary to get a single star."
1,Was going to buy...,"...no, not if the material has been cropped. There's no reason for it. If you agree, please send your message by not buying this blu-ray until they smarten up and re-release with the original 1.33 aspect ratio. Ugh :("
5,This is a Great Series!,"This is great for any history lover, tells tons of info. Ive learned a ton so far, oh did I mention that the 9 disk total to 26 hours of non stop film! Awesome!!"
4,Volume problem on the World at War,"The series is still priceless. I had a real problem with the DCDs themselves - being able to hear all the commentary. Sometimes it was so low that I couldn't even hear it with my ear next to the TV speaker. It may have been a problem emmanating from the VCR, but I still don't know.I finally was able to solve the problem by hooking up my Bose radio/CD player via AUX cables. Then I used the volume on the Bose. That solved the volume problem and I have been able to enjoy the set tremendously - and learn a lot too.I noticed the same problem with other DVD's made from old (probably) VHS. When I put a new movie on the DVD player, such as the Harry Potter movies on DVD, the sound is perfect. I think the problem lies with the old programs that are redone onto DVD."
1,Blu-ray butchery,"I have to join those you decry the fact that they have chopped the original 4x3 image ratio in order to make the image fit on widescreen televisions without black bars. This is particularly egregious when they show the original newsreel footage which cuts out vital information and has to resort to pan and scan techniques in order to convey some of the images.On top of that, this edition leaves out the producers introduction to each episode which conveyed important and fascinating information as to how each episode was made and the challenges facing the filmmakers.A very shoddy presentation of a documentary masterpiece."
5,The World at War - Blu-Ray,The whole process was slick and easy and the package arrived before the due date. People in South Africa need to remember that VAT is also due on receipt. The quality of the new discs is awesome and is imperative for anyone interested in history or would like their kids understand what happened in the second world war. This is a real keeper.
3,This is NOT the U.S. NTSC Edition!,"Be careful with this set! While the NTSC American edition is also available, this is the PAL edition, which is generally only playable on European TV sets. Order at your own risk!"
1,Cultural vandalism,"For decades films were ruined by panning and scanning, hacking the sides of the image and only 4:3 material was shown correctly. Now audiences are accustomed to black bars on 2.35-1 films on widescreen TVs we get the ludicrous irony of 4:3 material being butchered so those with no visual sensibility won't complain when it doesn't fill their 16:9 TVs.The World at War is the greatest documentary series ever produced. It is nothing less than cultural vandalism to restore it only to present it with the 30% or so of the image missing from every shot.I'd buy this in a moment if it was presented properly. I wouldn't pay a penny for this version. If everyone boycotts it Freemantle will rapidly change their mind and release it at 4:3 so as not to loose a fortune in sales."
5,Fun in the Sun - Mexico Style!,"What a charming little movie! If you love Mexico, especially those isolated little beaches where the locals welcome travelers with a smile, this is a film for you. Interesting characters and story with twists, gorgeous scenery, and a pleasing dose of off-beat humor captures the essence of alternative travel experiences. The Director's Audio Commentary is heart-felt and informative and gives us insights into the Deleted Scenes as well. Recommended."
3,which way por favor,was okay... I was in Yelapaand wanted to see a little moreof the actual scenery...beautiful jungle!
4,THIS IS UFO,THIS IS A VERY GOOD MICHAEL SCHENKER ERA UFO CD.THE SONGS ON THIS CD ARE VERY GOOD.THIS IS A GOOD PLACE TO START IF YOU ARE NEW TO UFO.
1,Boring,This game is boring! My four year old son seems to like it but the rest of the family hates it. It is not worth the $10 I paid for it.
2,Smell is unbearable,"Few years ago I have similar lotion from the same brand, and I liked it a lot. So I didn't hesitate before buying it. However, when I finally got it I was really surprised. The lotion is different now. The smell is unbearable!!!"
5,This is fine Technology,"You have to try these headphones. They work exactly as advertised (MB210b). Except the user manual says to turn your bluetooth phone on first in discover mode and then turn on your iMuffs on. Well that didn't work on my RAZR phone. I had to turn on the iMuffs first and then have my phone search for it.The sound of music is very good. For best results I have my iPod (60GB video) on at one-third volume and then adjust the iMuffs to the desired volume.These things are amazing and I wouldn't be surprised if in the future, Apple may sell new versions of iPod with wireless headphones. It just seems so logical."
2,IMuff Headphones,IMuff Headphones did not work well with the IPhone. The headphones would shut off and you would have to turn off the IPhone and try to find the connection between the two again. Very time consuming.
2,Not good enough for the price,"These headphones are OK but I have 2 main problems - the fit is poor and I have a hard time keeping them on my ears. Also, they cut out constantly. I think if you plan to sit still and use them it might be OK but I find them constantly cutting out when I am moving around trying to do yardwork, walk, ski, etc. Seem to have a conflict when they come near anything else electrical. Great idea, poor execution and quality."
1,not durable,"i recently purchased this product. i used it maybe 12-14 times working out before it completely shut down. i am so disappointed, as soon as i started using it i knew it was not built very well i did my best to protect it from the smallest things but still it just stoped working i didnt drop it, i didnt get it wet, i didnt do anything it was simply on my head and stoped. these are the worst headphones i have ever had."
2,Very solid product - while it works.,Received my iMuffs for Xmas 2007. Worked great for the next 2 years although the Ipod adapter was a little awkward at times. The device refused to charge a few months ago and I contacted Wi-Gear. They were absolutely no help. The response I received leads to believe that they were fairly familiar with my complaint and simply don't care. Beware - this product is not likely to last too much longer than the warranty.
4,Not bad,"Works better than the regular old rabbit ears. On some channels turning the power up too high actually causes interference but I positioned it to where it will bring in all the channels clealy without having to re-adjust it. I was expecting it to perform better than what it does but not complaining because it does the job. I still say keep analog, I prefer a little ghosting rather than losing the entire signal with interference."
4,Terk TV-3,I purchased a new TV with a digital tuner for my brother because his old analog set died. He does not have cable or satellite so he needed rabbit ears. The product worked reasonably well in bringing in digital signals. His location is very iffy and digital is an all or nothing proposition. On the strong signals he gets a very good picture. There are local channels that come in with analog but won't come in with digital. He is disappointed in that.The problem with the Terk antenna is that the cable is too short. I would like to have been able to move the antenna to a different position to see if we could get some of those missing channels.
2,Not What I thought,"Hooked this up about a year ago and thought it was great. I got 7 stations and I live in a canyon. Two spanish, three cartoons and two I could watch. I was still happy to not have a monthly bill-and we don't get anything else down in here but spotty sat. and that is expensive. However, I got another tv for the bedroom and hooked up an antenna I got from kmart and I got 13 channels. Obviously I got another of the same type for my living room and booooyahhh I have 13 in my living room now also. Would not get another of these."
3,"Didn't work for me, but...","This antenna didn't work well for me, but that doesn't mean it won't work well for you. My advice is to try out several antennas and see which one works the best for your situation. Don't even bother reading reviews because what works for one person might not work well for another."
4,Changing of the Guard,"""Temple of the Tigers"" follows the fortunes of Bengal tigers in India. Set in a nearly-abandoned Hindu temple complex (save for one priest), we see the dominant male struggle to maintain his rule over the territory. He is eventually unseated by his own kin (a grandson), and the cycle begins again.Also included is the challenges faced by a female tiger in raising her young. Not only must she provide food for them, she must also provide for their safety, including from other bengal tigers (usually males).Watching over all of this is the Hindu priest, who is the sole caretaker of the temple, which is now half-overgrown with trees and shrubs. Only an annual holiday visit from the local townspeople keeps the temple ""active.""Overall the program was interesting and informative. Four stars."
1,product busted,"when I opened the paking it look like someone punch the front of product. the blue cylender was in 6 pieces, the whiteframing had 90% broke off and the top where light blinks was broke in half. I glued it all but it looks pretty crappy. Seeing the glue lines and the stairs that go around dont match up but I made do. I have spent almost $1,000.00 to amazon and this is first time but it looks like it was returnded before cause white stairs have glue globs and the blue lid looks like someone tried to glue it with elmers glue. I am very disappointed this time. This order was over $300.00"
3,Sweet,"A lovely story with beautiful music. Boring at times, but all in all it was sweet.If you are paying attention you know what is coming next, so nothing is a surprise."
1,a high school romance move with time travel magic piano,don't waste your time unless you like high school romance movies. this really isn't a 5 star movie. not sure how this got so highly rated.
4,Good movie with great Blu-ray presentation,"This is an entertaining flick and an excellent Blu-ray Disc. The movie has some surprising plot twists, but I can't really say any more without spoiling it. Jay Chou (INITIAL D, CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER) both directs and stars in this film, and he acquits himself surprisingly well. The English subtitles are fine. Recommended."
5,Great to Start Exercising your Baby's Brains Early in Life,"I consider this CD different from all the other old boring classical music CDs claiming to make use of the well known Mozart Effect.The music has been combined with low frequency nature sounds and the sounds of a mother's hearbeat to help soothe your baby. It also has low frequency educational verbal messages that help your baby's brain start learning about numbers, the alphabet and other."
1,Expired product sent by seller,"I liked the product info as it contained no harsh or carcinogenic chemicals but unfortunately received the product which was expired. I called the seller and got my refund back which is a good part of buying through Amazon. The seller's carelessness about selling expired products to consumers, makes me think twice about the goodness of the product itself."
5,Better Than I Hoped For,"If you have any appreciation for this type of music or these performers, you will be absolutely delighted with this DVD. My wife has watched this maybe 50 times (and a dozen for me)."
5,Blue Man Group - The Rock Tour Live,"This is a visual and audible treat to watch. These folks have ""GOT THE RIGHT STUFF""."
2,The Complex Rock Tour Live - not the real thing.,"The Blue Man Group is pretty amazing live. I've seen them in Boston, and once you've seen the real thing, a DVD just won't cut it. BUT, I got this because it was cheap and I was curious about how they'd pull off the show in an arena setting. The ideas are there, just lost on the big stage. Get this DVD if you've never seen the Blue Man Group, but if you get a chance go see them in a small theatre instead."
2,Only Mediocre,"I saw the Blue Man Group show in Chicago in June 2005, and it was absolutely incredible, totally random, and awesomely funny. I bought the DVD in July at Fry's, and was rather disappointed. Don't get me wrong, the music is out of this world fantastic, it was just that the focus was not particularly on the Blue Men. In addition, in the Chicago show, there were only three band members, and they were up in a screened-off loft with glow in the dark t-shirts. I didn't like in the DVD how there were half a dozen band people sprawled across the back of the stage. And the vocalists were actually quite a major turn-off for me. If I were you, I would go to NYC, Boston, Chicago, or Las Vegas and see the live show, and just forget the DVD."
1,Blue Man Group DVD,The DVD was technically poor and not very entertaining. I hope the Blue Man Group is more interesting in person. I was disappointed!
1,Bad DVD,"I wish I could give a positive review of this product but unfortunately the DVD will not play on a Sony DVD player, Sony Playstation 3 or an XBox 360. I am wondering if this was a copy or just a defective DVD. The seller was prompt in the delivery however."
1,100% cocoa Butter---NOT!,"It is not what they advertise, was not 100% cocoa butter and when I tried to get a refund it took me 3 months and a lot of phone calls, I will not purchase from these people again!"
5,Great Read for the Wanderlust,This is a great book for the young traveller. After returning from a trip to Europe I found myself wanting to relive the experiences. Unfortunately North American culture just isn't the same. This book brought it all back. I would also recommend this book to the wannabe backpacker. It offers excellent tips on security and social / cultural situations.
2,Bad case for a good PDA,"I recently received a Palm LifeDrive with this hard case. I knew I wanted a hard case after having an excellent Palm hard case for my T2. So, I bought the case at the same time as the LifeDrive.I really like the LifeDrive. I really do not like the hard case.I ended up with the leather case from Palm and that works fine.The hard case is very difficult to open and probably does not even protect the PDA as well as the leather case.Stay away from this hard case."
4,"Nice Case, Except...","I love the feel of the case; it has a nice rubbery back that's comfortable to hold. When open, the hinges fold out to give you access to the buttons underneath. Very sturdy, sure to offer a long life and excellent protection since I carry it around in my pocket.Biggest flaw though: it's very hard to open. There's a thumb indentation in the rubberize edge that doesn't seem to offer much help. You have to stick a thumbnail and pry the lid off. And now my thumbnail is sore. Surely there has to be an easier way to pry the lid up.Also not that you have to remove the case completely if you bought the optional charger with the cradle. The case is too think for the Lifedrive to sit in the cradle."
2,It will break your fingernail and cut your finger.,"You open this hardcase by sliding your fingernail under the lip of the flap and pulling. It's a hard pull. I have healthy, strong nails, and it broke one of mine. It also cut me under the fingernail.Other than that, it's a nice design, but who cares? The whole point of a PDA hard case is to use the PDA in the case so that it stays protected. The only way to use this case without wrecking your nails is to slide it out of the case every time you want to use it.I received it today. It's going back today."
5,Fantastic!!!,this Video Captures the Year 1984 in the NBA.THe Sixers got Upset by the Nets.alot of Great Stories were developing such as the Cletics&Lakers bringing back Classic Battles.Bird&Magic were Hitting there Peak&Prime.what a time period in the NBA it was??
5,Better Than Expected!,"Purchased directly from Amazon for $13.49.Recently, my local PBS station aired an edited version of this DVD and immediately, my mother (who was in her early 30s during Croce's time) asked me to see if I could get it online. I too, have become a fan of Jim Croce and this DVD is better than I expected. It's about an hour of live television performances and the DVD has a separate commentary by his wife, Ingrid.Some other reviewers have listed the songs/videos, so take a look at those for the details. I can say the quality is good considering the videos are from various live television performances (two are slideshows). Seeing Jim's facial expressions as he performs really elevates the listening enjoyment of his music.If you're a Jim Croce fan and you don't have any DVDs of his live performances, then I highly recommend you get this one.Hope that helps!"
3,A good 'ice breaker' for an OLDER child,"If you let your 6 year old read this book you're crazy! This book is appropriate for kids who are beginning to ask questions about sexuality and puberty. I wouldn't 'just read it' before my kids were curious. It has funny pictures, and addresses puberty from both the male and female sides. It's not a medical book, it's a way to begin to discuss the topic and assess how much your kids know and how much they need to know and when."
1,Save your money.,"I had this subwoofer in a custom ported enclosure, hooked up to a Hifonics Brutus BRZ2400.1D. I ran it wired in parallel for 2 ohms (EXACTLY like every other dual 4 ohm sub I've ever had) at about 1500w RMS. All levels were turned down to less than 1/2. The sub lasted for four minutes at 15 out of 60 volume on my head unit with NO bass boost. After the initial song (Blunt Blowin' by Lil Wayne, not exactly a banger), I turned up the volume to 25. Within a minute, the sub blew. Cut it apart to see the damage and sure enough, both coils blown. I'm not impressed. As a matter of fact, I'm disgusted. Four minutes WAY below RMS? I understand its cheap, but damn.Pros: Cheap and loud, while it lasted.Cons: Cheaply made, poor sound quality even at low levels, power is FAR over-stated. I was only going to run it a few days while I waited for my new subwoofer to come in, I was anticipating blowing it. But not after four minutes, and definitely not at the wattage/volume I was running it at."
1,"Not good, Dont waste your money and time!!!","Asalam Alaikum. I dont recommend this DVD, it has false, gross and wrong information about Muhammad (saw) and Islam. Dont waste your money and time on this one!! Do a search online for ""authentic islamic information"" and inshAllah (God-Willing) you will find some usefull websites. Take care. Asalam Alaikum."
4,Great for the price,"All the reviews I read were right on, these speakers do just fine as an entry level surround system for dvds/movies but aren't as good for music cds. Don't get me wrong for the price I don't think you can beat it. I have these speakers set in a 20x15 room, powered by sony surround receiver. System works and sounds great. Speakers are easy to mount to the wall or where ever you want. Athena makes some stands for the speakers but the wife didn't like them so they're gone but speakers are small enough to go anywhere. So far my only negative comment would be that at times dialog sounds faint like it's coming from inside a box. This might be my fault since the TV we have does not have a large enough and flat top to place the center speaker so I mounted it slightly behind and above the TV."
5,WOW...just WOW!,"WOW. Really wow. I hooked this up and right after, ABC and CBS went from almost nothing to high def!!!!Then I ran AUTO PROGRAM, and BAM!!!!! Channels I didnt have before popped up! It picked up all over-the-air high def channels except for FOX and Kron-4. The antennaweb.org site suggested I use a multidirectional antenna. But this one does the job. My old rabbit ears indoor RCA antenna is nothing compared to this. My old antenna used to be on the sill outside the window, but it could only pick up a few channels clearly.I live in downtown San Francisco surrounded with brick (?), concrete whatever you call them, surrounded with many apartment buildings."
1,Inaccurate Depiction of UHF,"WARNING:I purchased the TV-1 because a local TV station went digital on an UHF channel. Previously the signal come through rabbit ears to a small TV. The station, by FCC regulation, changed from VHF (channel 6)to UHF (channel 15). The ad of the TV-1 does not show that an UHF loop is a separate piece. That piece must be attached with screws to the back of a TV set. As I recall UHF connections of this sort was possible on much older TV sets. I had purchased a new Samsung TV and there is no way I can attach the UHF loop. The TV-1 is worthless for my UHF use."
1,Not so great.,These are just too cheesy to work well. The stations that I can get with this antenna fade in and out. I suggest something else.
3,indoor tv antenna,I bought this so that I would be able to get some use out of an old tv. It brings in a few channels. For the money it is worthy of trying if you just want to be able to use a tv that is not hooked up to satellite or cable.
2,TERK TV ANTENNA,"Service in recieving the antenna was great. Antenna itself is no more than so so....but it was not overly expensive so my expectations were only moderate.Reviews I read raving about this antenna must have been written by the manufactuer. Reception on the old analog channels is much worse than the ten year old rabbit ears I pirated off an old TV to use. I get more channels, but only one of them is watchable, others are all static.Does digital reception, which the rabbit ears didn't, but those channels tend to break up / digitalize a lot.Bought annother TERK antenna a few years ago, which I paid a lot more for, that was suppose to be the high tech ultimate.....went in the trash after about two weeks."
4,Surprisingly Good,"As others have mentioned, this antenna is surprisingly good. Unpacked it and hooked it up. Received 40 local channels on my HDTV tuner (I AM, admittedly, very close to the local transmitter). As effective as the antenna is, I didn't like the idea of its shiny big antennae sitting out next to my nice new monitor. So, I went down to the shop and bought a ""high tech"" HDTV low profile GE amplified antenna. Got it home, hooked it up and got...HALF THE CHANNELS I GOT WITH THE TERK ANTENNA! The channels I got kept fading in and out. I'm returning the ""high tech"" antenna tomorrow and keeping my Terk rabbit ears."
5,Works great,"It works as advertised and a big plus is that it's cheap. I wish I brought along my older antenna before I moved out. That would've worked just as well. Before you even buy an antenna and blame it for being defective, do yourself a favor and research the signal strength near your home. Someone posted the site: http://www.antennaweb.org/ in their reviews and I saw that I had great signal strength. I advise you do the same."
1,Difficult,"Depending on the tv you are planning to use this with, it can be very difficult to set-up. Connecting the UHF/VHF small, metal hooks to the antenna piece was difficult. I still haven't used it, and just bought a different one. The item appears very cheap."
2,Wasn't very good for me...,"I didn't have very good results with this antenna, but I haven't had better results than with the simple telescoping antenna that came with my set.I expected a little better based on the strength of the reviews but not real surprised when it wasn't.Back to my original antenna."
5,Epiphany!,"We bought this antenna several months ago. We set up the rabbit ears but didn't have a place to connect the UHF loop. We were a little disappointed that we were only getting 2 channels. But college football bowl week motivated us to find a solution. My husband looked online at the product manual for our tv and discovered the solution was quite simple. All we had to do to get more channels was push the menu button on our remote then change the ""tuning source"" to ""air"" or ""antenna"". Boom instant Fiesta Bowl. Hope this helps someone out there who might also be stuck."
3,a taste of yesterday's wine,"THANK YOU!!! ....to every one of you who reviewed this album. Amazon gives ZERO INFO here; not even the track listings. Surely do wish ""Listen to Samples"" was available, also, as then I'd probably even BUY THIS ALBUM! Sincerely, Linda-Anne Manley"
4,Very Helpful,This book has been very helpful to me and it's still my first week in this class. I was really hesitant on buying this but I can already tell it's going to help me tremendously to get a good grade in Managerial Accounting. I would recommend this to anyone who will be taking this class in the future because it's very helpful and easy to follow.
3,Teaser,"Compared to the Michel Gondry DVD in the same series, this is extrememly disappointing. The book enclosed offers more information than the DVD. I was expecting a body of work, not a selection. What I saw I enjoyed, there just wasn't enough of it."
3,"Good, but could have been Great.","This is definitely worth picking up, but it's lacking quite a few things that would have made this a worthy package like the Spike Jonze and Michel Gondry dvd. I cannot believe only 5 minutes from Flex was used! I've seen the whole video and its brilliant, where's the rest of it?. Here's a list of whats missing.1.Auteurs: ""Light Aircraft on Fire""(This is seen on DVD menu page with the dog holding a guitar)2.Auteurs: ""Back with the Killer Again""3.Auteurs: ""Dubstar""4.12 Rounds ""Personally""5.Jesus Jones: ""The Next Big Thing""6.Lodestar: ""Another Day""7.Gene: ""Fighting Fit""8.Jocasta: ""Something To Say""9.Nissan: The complete commercial10.Dubstar: ""No More Talk""11.Holy Barbarians: ""Space Junkie""12.Life's Addiction: ""Jesus Coming In for the Kill""13.XFM : ""Clip Clop"" commercial for UK radio station14.ITV : ""Sport Is Free""commercial15.Flex: the full 17 minute short film.(this is unforgivable, its the real reason I bought this dvd in the first place)...."
5,An insightful book on chess insight,"I have owned this book for several years now, and it never gets old. When I find my chess skills lapsing into doldrums, I open this book and learn anew. This book is not meant for readers who are looking to an 'instruction manual' for creative chess, which is itself an oxymoron. But by showing the reader examples of chess creativity which are truly unforgettable (how many games of grandmasters' can one spend analysing, which merely rely on brute-force calculation?), Avni allows the reader to look at chess positions with new eyes. I highly recommend this book for any chess enthusiast either with an avid interest in the sheer beauty of the game or someone who is getting bored with his own playing style."
4,"Classic Kinison, Great Transaction",If you want classic Kinison this is the DVD you're looking for! Just beware...with it comes all of the classic Kinison language as well. This was a great transaction. DVD was received in the time and condition expected. Would definitely buy from this seller again!
1,NOT 7 Jeans!!!,Beware! These are not Seven for All Mankind Jeans! You can tell by the fake logo and the pocket design in the pictures.
1,THESE ARE NOT 7 For All Mankind Jeans! FAKES.,"these are NOT 7 for all mankind jeans if that's what you are looking for - those jeans go for $125-200 a piece. the people who make these came up with their ""similar"" name to trick you into buying them - they probably figure its a numbers game and ""some"" will just keep them.. dont be fooled - if youre looking for real 7's - go to eluxury.com and you'll find them there."
5,Ordered to use on hair and nails,"The product arrived on time. It is true to size. I have only heard great things about Vitamin E use, so I ordered it to go in an oil blend I am making up to use on my hair."
5,"Didnt work for what I bought it for, but...","I was told to use Vitamin E oil on my post-acne marks(little red dots left from acne.) This exact brand of Vitamin E oil was in a magazine that said it would heal/fade post-acne marks. I bought the product and used it on my post-acne marks for about two months. I didnt see a difference at all in my marks. So of course I thought this was just another product that's going to go to waste. But before I was going to throw it away, I put it on my hands to see if it would work on my dry hands. It did! It made my hands so soft and smooth. I love this stuff now! It gives my body a pretty glow and it makes my legs have that silky smooth look. Now I'm glad I bought it, it really is a wonderful product. I no longer use lotion, I only use my Jason's vitamin E oil now!"
3,Richard Simmons - Supersweatin Party off the Pounds,The work out was good. I don't know about Spersweatin but I could work up a little sweat if I pushed. It was not exactly the work out I was looking for but it is a decent work out for someone who is trying to build up their workout regimen. I was not thrilled with the music. I prefer a little more modern upbeat music to keep me motivated.
1,CHEAP OIL,"THAT MOBIL ONE OIL SELLS FOR LESS THAN TEN BUCKS IN ALL MAJOR STORES , I NOW USE MOTUL MUCH BETTER OIL"
4,Good basic grammar,"This book is excellent for beginners who are wanting a book that gives basic grammar without all the extra information that confuses beginners. The book is well laid out, with information very easy to find. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that it is a little too brief. A few more examples of how the grammar works would have improved it greatly."
4,Irish a celtic language,I am studying irish with a native teacher. This is a indoeuropean language not similar as others languager of the same group. The phonology and morphology follows a sintonic rule and a good grammar is necessary to develop the study of this language. This grammar has helped me to walk ahead.
1,I Completely agree.,"I completely agree with the previous review. Between the stock footage and the miserable acting, the only reason I see for watching this disgusting pile of (...) is the fact that Eric Roberts starred in it, which if I wouldn't brag about, and that there were some excellent looking actresses in it. But hey, you can get those two qualities out of all kinds of movies. If you're are still tempted to see this movie, just watch Carnosaur 1&2 so you don't have to put up with glaring inconsistancies."
1,Carnosaur 4 (Real Title: Raptor),"Roger Corman has made another B-movie with a very low budget. I'm guessing that the makers of this film were either too lazy or had too little a budget to make their own dinosaur effects! They just took dino attack footage from Carnosaur (1993), Carnosaur 2 (1995), and Carnosaur 3: Primal Species (1996) and sandwiched it in between the poorly developed story and the even worse acting. I really don't understand why Raptor wasn't released as Carnosaur 4. Maybe Corman realized that not too many people liked the Carnosaur movies (but I liked them all), so he just slapped a new title on this stinking pile of poo to get more audience. Either that, or he didn't want to tick off whoever got the idea for the Carnosaur Box Set.So, I do not recommend this movie, unless you are a hardcore fan of B-movies."
5,Very practical,"I found a copy of this book at Goodwill. It takes the user from 5 minute verse studies through topical and entire book studies, with a place for daily recording of one's work. I've read the Bible for years, but never actually ""studied"" much of it. This book may be the encouragement someone wants to think more deeply about scripture with a daily plan that is not overwhelming."
5,Mind bending,"Took some time out to read this through and I feel like it's better than the other books by some of the same subjects written about here.What's really cool is it tells you what was going through the mind of the author when he was acting out the fantasies or crime scenes if you will. Much of it seems alot like the movie on Charles Watson's website, almost word for word. If you have any questions after seeing the Manson interviews this will answer them and also probably leave you with more, which is a blessing since it isn't boring yet it isn't sad enough to make you cry either.For an autobiography it is written well, and tells how the subject developed his love for God into a ministry and also used that love to help others and to further his own education in an unselfish manner.To be ordained, he worked long and hard hours and is still practicing as a minister having won the title after much involvement in ministering to others and being involved as a chaplain. Recommended...Aryan Somers"
5,A beautiful movie,"Not nearly as boring or silly as everyone said in the 70's, ""Last Year At Marienbad"" is one of the ten most visually perfect movie ever done - along such classics like ""Vertigo"" or ""2001"". And is also one of the most misterious and creepy cinematic experiences ever - it will leave you bedazzled and uneasy for days. Watch it alone with earphones to enjoy the great gothic soundtrack, and it will dawn on you that this one can be one of the greatest horror movie ever! And mrs. Seyrig is a joy to watch. Buy it!"
4,Just to watch Delphine Seyrig walking.......!,"One of the greats! Requires full concentration and a willingness to be hypnotized by the recurring imagery and the music. Delphine is stunning; the Man Who May or May Not Be Her Husband has a handful in Delphine. Greatest line: "" We are like two coffins buried side by side in a frozen garden."""
2,I tried to stay awake,"The University of Colorado's International Film Series played this film back in the seventies. My film professor recommended we go see it.I tried so hard to stay awake. I would fall off and get poked by my friend for snoring. I would sleep for ten minutes and nothing changed. I was not tired when I went in, but geez some experimental films don't make it. It made me appreciate Godard!Serious film students should see this, just as they must be forced to watch Michael Snow's Wavelength, forty-five minutes of a slow zoom, with equally torturous music."
4,Blu-ray review,"Fine BD release of this French classic directed by Alain Resnais (1961). Picture shows NATURAL film grain which is truthful to its theatrical presentation as screened by l'Institut Franais (e.g. a screening attended by myself)Film 7.5/10Picture quality: 8.5/10Aspect ratio: 2.35:1 (orig.)Black and whiteRun time, 24fps: 1 34'44""Audio: D;GB;F;EST: D; GB;F;;E;DK;NL;FIN;N;SWE;JRegion code: A;BExtras:- Introduction by Ginette Vincendeau- Short Film ""La Chant De Styrene"", HD- Short Film ""Toute la mémoire du monde"", HD- In the Labyrinth of Marienbad- Trailer- 20-page-booklet- DigipakStudio: Canal"
1,The Emperor's New Clothes,"This extremely boring French film has been pushed on film students for years. The only enjoyable things about it are the Chanel costumes and Seyrig's beauty which is definitely helped by lighting, make up, black and white film stock and the clothes. I fail to see the reason nearly everyone raves about this film. I speak French, am a filmmaker, and I understand and have read many reviews about what Resnais was attempting to tell us. The bottom line: this film is just flat out boring. If, in real life, you've visited a palace such as Versaille or chatted with a young woman in a beautiful dress at a social gathering, there isn't much impact for this film to make on you.Mozart said of music: ""it should never be painful to the ear but should flatter and charm it, and thereby always remain music.""This applies equally well to the seventh art form and this film is painfully boring to sit through."
1,94 Minutes of Torment,"I am an avid fan of foreign, avant-garde, bizarre, challenging and/or enigmatic films, but this one is just plain agonizing to watch. The photography and the characters are beautiful, but I had to view this film in two sessions, both of them tormentingly slow. At first I thought it was some kind of variation on Sartre's ""No Exit,"" but if it was, I was the one in the waiting room in Hell! This movie is pointless, vapid and pathetically pretentious. I hope God adds ninety-four minutes onto my life as a reward for sitting through Last Year at Marienbad!"
2,"""Last Pear at Marienbad""","""Last Year at Marienbad"". This is a Boring, basic ""French"" movie, although I wouldn't put it in the same sentence with ""The Seventh Seal"". It's a movie with questionable Claude Levi-Strauss language in spots, some meaningless New Wave scenes, no character development in others, and a somewhat predictable ending that altogether serves to pass the time away and/or play in the background while you do something else.Not exactly a landmark of French film making. Technically speaking, this movie is well made, which somehow makes it even worse."
1,"boring, infuriating, frustrating, what else?","It's often ranked as one of the ""greatest films of all time."" I found it long, boring, frustrating and infuriating to watch. I know, it's supposed to be an example of the nonnarrative film if you will. It's a ""european art film"" that is the exact polar opposite to the Classical Hollywood filmaking style. The film is all vague, some vague plot about an somebody having an affair, the characters are named X and Y, it all looks like some Calvin Klein perfume commercial. Abstract, okay I got the point after the first half hour. Did the movie have to be a whole hour and half of this? If I ever have to watch this movie again, will somebody please shoot me."
1,"Overall, a Poor Job","Why would anyone buy this product? You can tell by the picture that it's badly made. Any right-thinking conservative should find it a travesty of their beloved blonde blowhard. And what liberal would bother?Just to enumerate: The hair's wrong. The clothing is shoddy. The doll itself is cheap, you can tell by looking at the photos.I guess people buy this thing because they don't get enough of Ann's annoying, nasal-y voice on TV and radio."
4,Fun tool,"I had never seen an olive spoon before, but my spouse loves olives, so this seemed like a nice gift idea. It's attractive and it works well. I recommend it for anyone who's an olive freak."
3,What happened to Flaw?,"The album is good, but in small doses. It does not match up to Flaw. It grabbed me at first, but slowly let me down."
2,Gave me a headache,I loved Flaw up until now. This CD is just depressing to hear. I loved Through the Eyes but this just was horrible. The instrumentals was bad the only thing good was Chris's voice but I wish Flaw would just come out with another album already cause this band is not doing it for me. This CD actually gave me a headache after listening to once.
1,Vocals?,"Flaw and FBM would be OK if they had a lead singer to compliment the band! Good Music, Awful Singer and Lyrics. Flaw is at least a bit better than this CD."
5,Betsy,"This wine bottle coaster is beautifully painted, a generous size and substantial weight. I've purchased it as a gift for family who traveled to Umbria last summer. They are very knowledgeable about and enjoy wine, so I am hoping it will be a pleasant reminder of their trip. It arrived quickly and intact."
2,OK for Medical Schools but avoid for dental schools!,"If you're applying to medical school, this book would serve you well. For dental schools. it's another story. I wouldn't buy this book again if I were applying to dental school. Go to predentalinfo.com if you want the meat and potatoes of how to sort through dental schools and actually get accepted. Cheers, Jason."
3,Great for medical school but for dental school.....,"Barrons is a great book for medical school applicants but doesn't offer too much in the way for dental school applicants. The information found is not organized and I wouldn't personally recommend it. Instead, buy Dr. Kanani's book on dental school admission at dentalschooladmission.com The information is more current, better organized, and theres much more useful information that will actually help you do well in studying for the DAT, but more importantly, in presenting a strong and compelling application that will get you a seat in dental school. It got me in!"
1,A very bad book!,"The concepts are presented in a chaotic manner, without small and clear samples. The book could have some value only for html programmers that just want to broaden their knowledge a little bit. ..."
1,This is by far the worse book I ever read. REAL SHAME!,More and more books are written lately by poor visual basic programmers that have nothing to do with computer programming or computer science in general. This is one of them; a real shame for Microsoft Press...
4,Possibly the best in the 6th series,"I have the entire Ranma 1/2 6th Season and I think this Vol 5 may be the one best in the series possibly tied with the Vol 3 and Vol 7.The reason I give this a 4 star is because the episode that carries this DVD is episode 125 an Xmas without Ranma which is fantastic and a real feel good episode with all the characters we love getting together for Xmas. Ep 126 A Cold Day in Furikan was below average. Ep. 127 Akane Goes to the Hospital is nice because it reveals a deepening in feelings between Ranma and Akane but is otherwise rather uneventful.This is probably not the volume to buy if you like a lot of fighting. But if you enjoy the relationship part of the Ranma series you would probably enjoy this.If you are new to Ranma I would recommend getting one of the earlier boxed sets, if you are a diehard Ranma fan you probably want this in your collection."
4,More than I expected--WOW!,Listening to more Jim Reeves makes my day. I enjoy shopping for bargains at Amazon.
4,"Great concert, good dvd","I agree that the sound could be a little better in places, but all in all this is a good dvd. The song selection is pretty decent, although my favorites tend to be from their first two and last two albums, not much else in between. I actually think Jon's guitar sounds better than on some of the albums. They could have done without the keyboard sounds, but that's my opinion."
3,A starting point,"Marianna Haun's X-Factor is a starting point of information regarding the subject of the X chromosome, however, I felt the format of text hard to digest because the author's writing style is very broken up. The she wanders and comes back to the subject matter pages, and some times chapters, later. There is at least one pedigree error. Page 105 states Milan Mill is a daughter of Princequillo and the pedigree on page 106, shows her out of Caruso. Also, pedigrees of all listed DC mares would have been extremly informing and the index does not list all horses mentioned in the text. Myself being a researcher, would have liked to have had a bibliography included so I could varify the information presented. My general opinion of this work is that Ms. Haun compiled information from research work that has been done on this subject without a complete understanding of the subject matter herself."
5,And the Stormwatch brews a concert of Kings!,"Stormwatch is most probably the last great Jethro Tull album and also a sort of lost, underrated gem. All the elements that made Songs From The Wood and Heavy Horses brilliant are present here: the same line-up, great arrangements and daring songwriting. It's a fitting close to this beautiful trilogy. Dark Ages must be one of their best late seventies tracks, with Dun Ringill and Flying Dutchman coming close. I'm not sure why this album is so misunderstood, given the amazing songs that unfold cleverly Ian Anderson's wit once more. If in doubt, give it another chance for sure. And get this remastered version for soundsake!"
1,the living dead,"I bought this (on vinyl disc) when it was originally released in the vain and futile hope that the group had recovered from its precipitate decline (beginning with the banal ""War Child"") or at least gone into remission. No such luck; ""Stormwatch"" is simply awful. I gave my copy away."
1,Y-U-C-K,"Neither ""am I among those Tull fans who believe that the band, at least creatively, ceased to exist after 1979"". No, like every former Jethro Tull ""fan"" I've ever known, I believe the group ceased to exist creatively after 1973! THIS record, though, is particularly A-W-F-U-L."
1,thumbs down,"In my book someone who ""[owns] THIS ALBUM ON 8-TRACK TAPE, LP, AND TWO DIFFERENT VERSIONS ON CD"", who ""[owns] JETHRO TULL AND IAN ANDERSON'S ENTIRE RECORDED OUTPUT"", and who writes entirely in upper-case letters, is a fanatic, and not to be trusted. A legitimate review is a different thing from propaganda. We are capable of reading this record's slanted, disingenuous liner notes ourselves, by the bye; you don't have to cut-and-paste them for us.In any case, this was easily Jethro Tull's worst record to date (the date of its original release, that is)."
4,Very Enjoyable,"As much as I like the idea of Jethro Tull, I have found much of their music quite dull. Yeah, that phrase rhymes, but for me, it is also true. Ever since I was impressed with This Was, their first album, the only one that has given me a rise has been Aqualung. I have quite a few Tull albums but have often come away disappointed.Stormwatch is a nice change. I've had the CD for years but have never really listened to it until recently. When I did, it sort of crept up on me. It is actually quite good. It is not This Was, it is not Aqualung, and it is not Passion Play. Yet, it is still Jethro Tull. I found myself taken in by the music and didn't get bored once. Maybe it was because I haven't listened to Tull in quite a while (except for This Was) and I was able to listen to it with fresh ears.Stormwatch is quite good and I highly recommend it."
1,Contradicts The Bible,"There is a fairly large selection of excerpts from Placebo on Pittman's website. I read enough to know I could not go along with his philosophy. He states, ""If we are made in [God's] image, then we are spirit, we are invisible, and we are immortal."" 1 Timothy 6:15-16 states plainly, ""God, the blessed and only Ruler, the King of kings and Lord of lords, who alone is immortal.."" Who am I going to believe, Paul or Howard Pittman? When one flaw of such gargantuan proportions jumps out at you, how many others are lurking in Placebo?"
5,"A real ""Wake up"" call",This is one of the most abrupt awakenings you will ever have. It really hits you in the face on the way God wants you to live. It's right under our noses but we look over it just the way the devil wants
3,"sad CD, great songwriter, great voice","1. Overdrive -first single-bad choice2. I Like -good song3. Watching The Rain -didn't like4. Enchanted -sad, pretty5. Catch My Fall -didn't like6. Snowflakes -Beautiful sad song7. Glow -didn't like8. Teachin' Myself To Dream9. Vacation -rocking song10. Original Skin -didn't like at all.11. Lemon -great beautiful sad song12. Because I Can -good song"
4,Amazon's blatant bias,"Exactly what agenda is Amazon promoting with this book's default review page. Of twenty three total reviews, the three on the default page are the three 1 star while the other 20 (3 star and above) remain out of view unless the thinking customer clicks through to them. When 13% (all disproportionately negative) of the reviews take up 100% of the default space you have to wonder how well served the public is by the Amazon business model?"
4,Well done,"Good characters, a compelling story, some serious conflicts to work out: all the makings of a good novel. And Lee Nelson's foreword is equally interesting. Compliments to all involved."
1,"Heavyhanded ""morality"" play disguised as historical fiction","As someone with a degree in history and a longtime love of historical fiction, I can assure you ""Jacob's Blood"" is NOT a historical novel. It is a heavyhanded morality play that attempts to camouflage its self-serving message beneath a veneer of ""historical fact."" The author obviously did not attempt to research the historical time period in which he set his ""story"" but instead relied on stereotypes gleaned from Civil War-based television miniseries. A terrible disappointment for this reader, who was expecting a realistic period drama and instead got hit between the eyes with a sermon."
2,Meh . . .,"Very difficult to place properly in the shoe, and to keep them there. They actually caused a bit of pain as well."
3,another great album from steve roach,"steve picked up where midnight moon left off in 1999 with the guitar he borrowed from roger king in his bouts of insomnia during the making of dust to dust. it was a foreign object, but steve has been teaching himself how to use and incorporate this sound into his latest album. recorded all live in the timeroom in tuscon, az, he created lots of emptyspace ambient using guitar and etheral movements. this is not steve's best work, far from it, but it is a solid work of ambience. the album is meant for a late cold winter night, listening to it while thinking about whatever comes to mind. however, it's easy to be distracted from the music. roach fans will love it, but this is definitely not an album for the unitiated."
4,Blackballed,"Kind of funny, a little dry, some paintballers may not like it, but I thought it was funny."
4,These noodles are close to fresh made.,"The noodles that come with this pack are already cooked and soft and vacuum-sealed. They're like authentic fresh udon noodles. Just don't overcook them, no more than three minutes at a full boil, otherwise they get too soggy/soft. The soup base is rather plain (as with all of their flavors) but it isn't meant to taste like oriental-style ramen noodle soup seasoning packets. This really is meant to be garnished with vegetables for a more complete meal, otherwise it doesn't seem very substantial. One serving per package. About 280 cal and 1.5 grams (1500 mg) sodium per pack/serving. OUCH! But that's common for these soups anyway."
4,who cares what it's called?,"it's blues mashed with dance beats, and it sounds fantastic. Of course it doesn't sound like ordinary blues, but (as you North Americans like to say) ""hello?!"""
3,"Probably not for the blues purists, but...","...but for those of us who's eclectic tastes *include* the blues, there's a lot to like in this album. There are some sections of briliancy (""Let My Baby Ride"" and ""It's Bad You Know"" both just rock), and some sections that were a little repetitious for me.The North Mississippi All-Stars album Shake Hands with Shorty sounds like what you'd get if you gave an old R.L. record to a garage rock band. This album sounds like what you get when you give that same record to a techno DJ. There's a lot of sampled cuts looped together and layered under electric guitar and drums. Some vocals are re-mixed in as well.Definitely worth checking out if you're looking for something different."
4,R.L. stays fresh and interesting,"Why must the old blues masters limit themselves by putting out the same thing over and over? R.L. has balls. There are traditional R.L. songs on this lp, but there's also some with some heavy drum beats. Is this bad? No way. It keeps the album interesting. Is this still the blues? It's not a traditional blues album, but it's still the blues. Is it good? Damn right."
3,Better Live!,"I saw R.L. Burnside live a few years ago at a blues festival and loved his on stage preformance. I was a little disapointed in his studio CD however. There was too much technology, synthetic sounds, and gadgetry for me. I much prefered the raw pure blues sounds that he made live on stage.R.L. is a great bluesman but I liked him better on the stage then on this CD."
2,RL's complacent experimentation finally fails,"rl burnside is one of the best blues artists of contemporary times. All of his recordings have been excellent to date except this one. The experimentation with JSBX was not straight blues but it worked. this album would be better coined ""club burnside"" as the record sounds as if burnside was dubbed over the pet shop boys monotonous dance beats that tired 10 years ago(no offense to the pet shop boys but let the pet shop boys do the pet shop boys!). Go to his concerts, buy his other records but skip this one. Lastly, of all the lame beats two of the songs do retain burnside's style and one strange track with the always talented alec empire actually pulls off the electronic burnside!"
4,Teacher's Grade: B+,"The Charlie Bone series is an entertaining one, and all the kids I know who read it want to keep reading more. That's my goal as a teacher, so I try not to quibble with the gigantic plot holes that exist in the world Nimmo has created. Nor do I care that the main character seems to have no personality. He merely serves as a plot anchor.I confess that I enjoyed this book, and am happy that so many of the 3-5th grade kids I teach and know enjoy it too."
2,Charlie Bone and the Time Twister,"The book was ok. There was a little suspense and excitement. But, things keep coming that just come from nowhere. Such as the girl becoming a bird and the secret tunnel just happening to be there when they need it. No one had mentioned it before. It seems to be a poor knockoff for Harry Potter. I really don't know how they got published. I've read two now and will probably not read any more."
4,Book 2- Time Twister,"This book wasn't as fast pace and interesting as the first but that is only because you already know how everything is between charactors and events! In Time Twister ,Charlie Bone and his endowed/gifted friends have to help a 10-year-old boy from 100 years ago! Henry Yewbeam, who just happens to be a relative of Charlie, was thrown into the future by his evil cousin Zeke when he was 10. Now he has to have Charlie's help to avoid his evil relatives who will stop at no odds to get rid of him.I recomend this book to anyone who likes Harry Potter, Lemony Snicket, or Pendragon."
3,Really only for Potter withdrawal,"If there had never been a Potter series, this set might have stirred up a lot more critical interest. As it is, this set just seems to be lighter and weaker than Potter, even though it copies virtually every important aspect of Potter.That said, I don't necessarily mind Potter clones, if well-written and reasonably imaginative I'd rather read them than just re-read Potter. The problem with Bone is that it almost is like just re-reading Potter.So, if your reader hasn't read or didn't get into Potter, or is just nuts for more Potter, this could be a good choice. If your reader wants to move beyond Potter there are many new series out that stand on their own feet and plow new ground. (I'm thinking Riordan's Percy Jackson books, or Nix's Keys to the Kingdom series, or Mull's Fablehaven series.)"
5,twisted through time,"Charlie Bone has gone to Bloor's academy for exactly a year now. And he is hoping that the new semester doesn't bring too many unwanted surprises. But when Henry Yewbeam is twisted through time from the icy winter of 1916, can Charlie and his friends help Henry get back to his family?if you enjoyed the first one this is definitely worth reading."
2,Well,"I couldn't really get into this book. I guess it wasn't my type of novel. I think that if your in to reality TV, you'll enjoy it. It has an interesting concept and a decent enough plot. To me it seemed to somewhat linger, yet for fans of trapped and island like scenario's, you will be delighted."
5,Fantastic Book,"Excellent for anyone, especially women, who has suffered depression and/or loss of faith.Not a book to be gulped down. Yes, it's short - and it's powerful. This book should be pondered while sipped slowly."
1,Not effective,"I'm sick with a cold, so I've mostly been sitting in bed the past two days while using this deodorant. No high-temperatures, no vigorous activity. I bathed today and applied the deodorant - and even reapplied a few hours later- but all day I've been thinking I forgot to put deodorant on. It just doesn't work for me."
1,This thing sucks,"Neat set up, to bad I could not use it. There are some cards this thing will not work with. The only way to find out if it is going to work on your system is to sit on hold with the no toll free number for 20 min so you can be told by a rude service rep that your system is incompadable. Save yourself the frustration, money, and time. DON""T BUY IT!"
1,Changed my mind,"When I listened to it the second time, I realised that it was totally brown chunks of lama! If this CD would stop world destruction, I'd prefer not to use it!"
2,"if it's really Sash' life, he must be a boring guy","Apart from Equador, Stay, and the Future Breeze remix of Encois Une Fois (the original is absolute mediocrity) the rest of this album if filled with, well, just that: filler. Apart from the song Hoopstar, which has a nice sort of electro, breakbeaty, DnB feel (well, as DnB as EuroCheez :) can get), the other songs plod along all similar and all heard somewhere before. For me, my favourite tracks are Stay, with Le Trec doing the tortured vocal chorus bit quite well, and the mighty EQUADOR! with the instantly recognisable melody. Only buy this if you couldn't get hold of any of the singles because they are the only ones you'll be listening to."
4,Trains run on time,"I have had this watch for over two years and it is great. I have NOT had trouble finding a place to change the battery. The little watch kiosk in my train station does it. I ride the trains in Chicago and they run on a tight schedule, trains typically leave with in 15 seconds of their scheduled time. Before this watch I was always running for the train because I was not sure my watch was accurate within seconds. Now I have total confidence that my watch is accurate.My only two dings on this watch are that the crystal is plastic and prone to scratching and the watch band broke after two years.I am on Amazon today looking for a new watch because between the broken band and the upcoming battery change I have about $25 in repairs coming up. I think I will just get a new one with a clean crystal."
5,A Synthesis of Mysticism,"Andrew Harvey has been able to synthesize all that I have been researching for the past year. My journey has taken me to the writings of Merton, M. Basil Pennington, Theophan, Keating, Thomas a' Kempis and books about Francis of Assisi. Suddenly, in one rich tome, Harvey brings together an entire years worth of information between the covers of a single book! Those who dismiss this book out right are either uncomfortable with the author's life-style or too terrible rigid in their dogma. For those interested in the mystical aspect of Christianity, this book is a must read. Going into any reading experience thinking you will agree with everything the author says will always lead to disappointment. Go into it, instead, for what you can glean out of it."
1,not antproof,"Although pleased with the size, looks, and feel of the cake server, I was very disappointed when I found ants crawing between the base and the top to feast on and become lost in the icing of my daughter's beautiful cake. Still haven't figured out a way to make a gasket to provide an airtight seal, or if I should just throw the server away."
1,Damaged!,Fireplace screen came damaged in box. Sent pictures in for proof. Vendor wanted to give me a discount on screen. I refused. Vendor gives terrible customer service. Fighting to get get a refund.
4,Looks and works great!,I was incredibly satisfied with this fireplace screen. It looks great and not at all cheap. Great purchase for the price. It was shipped quickly and is very functional. It is pretty light weight and works perfectly for us. No complaints here.
3,Good from afar...,"The screen has a nice look to it from across the room, but the closer you get you can see the cheap construction."
2,not worth the money!,Pretty screen but very poorly made. We bought for 65 and noticed a recent increase in the price. Definitely not worth more than that. It came damaged and I had to return it. Hoping for something better in quality.
2,Did not live up to expectations...,"This is a pretty fireplace screen, don't get me wrong, but it is cheaply made. I should have gone with my gut feeling after reading previous reviews. It is not worth the money I paid for it. It's very light weight and easily bends. We had bought one at Target that was much better quality and better weight for less that we were replacing for this one only because it was taller. I would suggest you keep looking if you don't want to be disappointment."
2,Very Predictable,"This book was ok, but a bit dry & predictable.I recently read to my son another book about a Newfoundland dog that he enjoyed better called ""Wild Man Island"" by Will Hobbs. It is fast paced w/out being confusing."
1,Yuck Yuck and double Yuck,"I'm not even sure I know what this movie was about. Supposedly a horror flick, the bloody gore is so prolific it's almost laughable. There is a dark lord in the movie who, once obtaining a special amulet that will make him invincible even in daylight, must be stopped. The rest of the movie is all about who wants to be a vampire. Pass on this one, the actors are horrible, the plot is thin, and it's a B movie at best."
5,Great Soothing Jazz,"The Marlowe Suite is delightful music for pleasureable listening. The four musicians, Tony Taranto (piano), Mark Neuenschwander (bass), Mark Gould (saxophone) and John Shaw (drums) make scintillating harmonious renditions of Clint Page's compositions. It is a terrific addition for any true smooth jazz lovers collection."
5,Wonderful book for children. Product in perfect condition.,Kenneth Taylor's books are great. This particular one is good for a short biblical story before bedtime and the children I know love finding the lady bugs hidden in each picture. This product was in perfect condition when I got it.
4,Big Thoughts for Little People,"This is a great ""start our morning"" devotional. It is best suited for preschool age. I thought the pictures were a little hard to see but the kids have no problem figuring out what people or toys are doing in order to answer the questions. The book uses the alphabet to communicate a different character trait which it focuses on with a statement and then a few questions. Then there is a Bible verse at the end. Short and sweet, we enjoy it over breakfast."
2,JUST ANOTHER GANGSTA MOVIE,"THIS IS JUST ANOTHER ONE OF THE MANY GANGSTA MOVIES THAT CONTINUE TO LINE UP ON THE SHELVES OF VIDEO STORES ALL ACROSS AMERICA. IN THIS ONE, TWO YOUNG MUSICIANS STEAL A HOT SONG THAT DOESN'T BELONG TO THEM. THE SONG UNEXPECTEDLY BECOMES A HIT FOR THEM AND WHEN THE ORIGINAL OWNER FINDS OUT ABOUT IT, HE TRYS TO KILL THEM. THIS IS NO DIFFERENT FROM ANY OF THE OTHER GANGSTA MOVIES. DESPITE THE FACT THAT THEY ARE ON THE COVER FOR THIS MOVIE, COOLIO AND CLIFTON POWELL BOTH HAVE SMALL ROLES. A MAN NAMED GEORGIO [WHO ALSO IS THE DIRECTOR] IS THE REAL STAR OF THE MOVIE. YOU MIGHT BE BETTER OFF RENTING THIS ONE INSTEAD OF BUYING IT. MS. TOI ALSO HAS A ROLE IN THIS MOVIE."
5,Every parent needs this!,"I haven't had the opportunity to use everything in this kit as my daughter is only 10 months old. However, the ones I have used have worked great. I was skeptical of homeopathic medicines; however, not anymore! I highly recommend this to all parents."
2,Organization and Format Lacking,"Before buying this book, I was influenced by the name recognition of Bartletts and bought the book mainly for itsknown reputation in the past. I was very disappointed! Half the book is an index and, even then, to see the complete quotation, you have to look up each partial quote for the complete quote. Too much work for me! I returned the book."
2,Disappointing,"If you are looking for a book of quotations to browse and gain inspiration, this is not the book you are looking for. It is a reference and is as boring to read as any other reference you might come across. One-fourth of the book is an index of authors. Some of the choices about who is included and not seems arbitrary and disappointing. For example, you can find Ann Landers but not Robert F Kennedy quoted within."
4,used book excellent condition and a good transaction,liked the book and got it a great price.words of wisdom over the centuries.
2,Disappointed,I guess I'm not a fan of cat's eye. The cat's eye on the beads was not as white as in the picture. It looked gray and I didn't like it.
5,"1 word...""Classic""","What can u say about Chapter 2:World Domination? 1 word, a ""Classic"". This is probably 3/6 @ their best, including Mystic Styles and Chapter 1 The End. This album starts off w/ a couple of intro tracks, but once it gets into the music, its good from start to finish. The beats are on point on this c.d., from start to finish. 3/6 also upped their lyrics and slowed their flow down, instead of trying to rap like Bone. I like Bone, but let Bone be Bone and 3/6 be 3/6. This c.d. also has some of the last remaining dark sounding beats before they hit mainstream.When I first heard this c.d., I was like damn, a straight banger right here, not to mention its from 1997, 11yrs old, but still sounds fresh.So do urself and do music a favor agrab this album, cuz u will never hear 3/6 like this again, never!"
5,Viva La Difference!,"As a professional therapist who has worked with ASD children for the last 6 years, Stephen's information is precious. After attending two conferences where Stephen lectured, I read his book and still learned more! He is warm, loving and very funny in person. He has so much information to share with us to help unlock the secret world of Autism. This info is pertinent to Parents, Siblings, Grandparents, Caregivers, Teachers, Therapists, Doctors and anyone else interested in truly understanding our ASD children! Keep writing and caring Stephen...we'll keep reading and cheering!"
4,"Beyond the Wall, Steven Shore","This articulate man gives us an autobiographical view at the difficulties faced as a person with high-functioning autism or Asperger's Syndrome grows up and tries to join the working world. It is tough, and he is often misunderstood, yet he very intelligent and has a great deal to offer the world. Although he will always have his ""social skills"" disability, it is heartening that he is now happily married and has found a career path."
5,An Absolutely Essential Book,"There are few truly essential books for new Jewish parents; if you are blessed with a daughter then Cohen's book is surely one of them. It is at its core an indispensable how-to guide for planning a beautiful Simchat Brit Bat ceremony step by step. But it is also so much more. It places the texts and rituals in their liturgical context and helps the reader to understand why each selection is relevant. Cohen has also written a wondrously inclusive book that caters to a broad spectrum of Jewish practices from traditional to progressive. My wife and I used this book and little else to plan a lovely, meaningful ceremony for our daughter. We've never owned a book that was so quickly dog-eared and full of notes than Cohen's masterpiece. It is an extraordinary work."
2,A few good ones...,"At least this album has a few good tunes, like DREAMING, LET IT RAIN and FEEL IT. But UFO is already clearly going downhill here, hiring rent-a-musician Neil Carter and sufferinf creatively without Michael Schenker."
4,Great Mexican Tuners action Movie,"I enjoyed this movie. A lot different than Fast and Furious, but that's good. We don't need another of the same anyway. Yes, there are Fast Tuner cars, pretty girls but in this movie also a lot of violence so watch the kiddies on this one. Sort of a ""B"" movie, sometimes acting is marginal and the end is somewhat confusing but great entertainment anyway and I recommend it."
3,A good summary of publicly available information.,"Although Ms. Dabbaugh has made a good effort to assist other victim parents in this summary of pubilicly available information, it should be noted that her presentation of Islamic law is often in error. Incidents reported to be representative of the application of the Shariah (Islamic) Law within the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia are not factual, can mislead the reader, and appear to be representative of a negative ethnic stereotype of the Arabic culture and traditions. In circumstances involving the custody abduction of children to the Islamic countries, it is advised that the reader seek advice from the US Department of State as well as the Embassy representing the nation to which the child has been abducted."
4,Pfaltzgraff Napoli Sugar and Creamer set,"this is the best creamer i've ever owned. finally, a creamer that holds enough milk to get through a coffe serving..every other creamer i have holds so little i was always getting up to refill it! the spoon for the sugar bowl is pretty useless and i Hate that its from china but its so nice i had to buy it!"
4,Under the Lighthouse Dancing,"This is a delightful, feel good movie. The scenery is beautiful and a very good advertisement for Rottnest Island in Western Australia where the story is set.The story line is poignant and demonstrates the value of good friends."
3,875mg,"I had ordered 900mg in the past and the last order on september 2011, they changed it to 875mg and no longer offered 2 for 1 again."
4,handy gun,If your in a war then and you run out of ammo on your other gun then this is the perfect gun it will get you out of it. My friend just got a automatic and this and this gun was ok if your 6-9 this is the perfect gun for you! So yea i guess it's alright
4,Wonderful Toy/DVD - We Love it,"This was given to my daughter as a Christmas gift when she was 4 months old. She absolutely loves this DVD. The only bad or annoying thing about the doll is that I can't always get it to work. You have to hold the doll in front of the TV speakers and it's supposed to sync up. Our doll just blinks instead of syncing so my daughter watches the video without the doll and enjoys it just as much. She especially loves when her adorable friends play ""peek-a-boo"" with her. She giggles the whole time.The doll is definitely a great interactive toy but the DVD by itself is amazing too. My daughter holds onto the lamb while she watches and pushes his belly button.I highly recommend this toy."
2,Be careful with fine hair,The Tea Tree Oil conditioner is strong smelling and too drying for my fine hair; perhaps on oily and thick hair it would be okay.
3,Fibromyalgia,"I have several of Dr. Colbert's series for ""The Bible Cure for..."" and they have been very helpful. But this one for me did not have enough helpful information for Fibromyalgia. Could be due the timeline. There is much more information that has been obtained by doctors than at the time this was written. I would love to see an updated series if there is one."
1,No Ray Lynch music on this CD!,"This was listed under Ray Lynch's albums, but there is no music fromRay Lynch!"
4,Almost my favorite cd...,"DJ Icey is definately my favorite dj. This is a very ""florida"" cd. Has gotten mucho time in my player. If you liked this, check out Sunshine State of Mind. Mellower tip, and phat as hell. Hardly leaves my player"
4,The Funky Breaks is one of my favs!,"Out of all my Dj Mixtapes (or compilations..whatever) this is one of my favs (next to DJ Dan's ""Loose Cabouse""). Icey sure knows how to mix up the coolest breaks. Dj Icey has always had a ear for pickin' a killer set. This album is best described in two words : Funky breakbeat. Awesome mixes of PM Dawn, Galaxy 21, headrillaz, and mixes of Icey's own stuff. Great party album, who needs a Dj when you got Icey?"
4,Great replacement,"I chose this gate to replaced an old one that was falling apart in my backyard. Is definitely a great concept, much easier to setup and pretty sturdy. The drawback is the instructions could be more user friendly. Another negative the little holder that prevent the diagonal truss cable from sliding is made of a too soft metal and gives up quite easy. I'd definitely purchase a second one when the other side gate of my backyard will give up."
4,Nice effort from Greg.,"There are some tracks on here that I'm not too crazy about, but there are some tracks on here which are quite good. If you like Greg's voice, you won't be disappointed, and Gary Moore (lead guitarist) makes a fine contribution."
3,Catchy despite itself.,First off let me admit I'm not much for the Punk screaming sound. That said I wasn't expecting much. The fact that the CD was recorded in 9 days didn't give me much hope either. But despite all that it catches you and hooks you in for 50 minutes of fun. Granted I couldn't catch all of the words but I caught enough of them to make sense of the songs unlike many Punk bands. These guys have a future if they refine their sound just a bit.
5,Nice mouse,"I bought my Wheel Mouse about a year ago. This is probably the best mouse you can get at a good price. Its like a Microsoft Intellimouse and a Microsoft Basic Mouse combined into one, keeping the Intellimouse Wheel and the Basic Mouse shape and feel."
4,Obsessive Compulsive,Very enjoyable EP containing four live tracks from Bob's late '90's resurgence as one of the great artists of our time. One of a series of similar promo releases by Sony / Columbia. Probably only of interest to obsessive-compulsive Dylan freaks.
4,Awesome,I've been using this shampoo for almost a month now . It gives my hair a really awesome shiny look and it's make it waaaaaay silky too . But I couldn't see any voluming !
1,Do not buy,I bought this shampoo hoping that it would thicken my hair. I was sorely disappointed when I got it because it smells like pure chemicals and I didnt notice any difference. If anything I noticed more hair falling out. Don't buy this product.
2,"Decent Shampoo, yet too much protein for me","I love the foam and how soothing it feels, I do not follow after the first poo since all the product, oils, and dirt is washed out in its first application. My only knock on the product it has way too much protein that causes my hair to tangle and knot up. That's why the product only got 2 stars, now if you are not protein-sensitive go for it."
2,Scalp problem products,"I was disappointed with this product as it has not really helped my itchy (non-dandruff), dry scalp from sensitive skin, being diabetic and over-coloring. I have not found this to be any sort of real scalp therapy that works. It is a nice light shampoo, smells pretty good even though there is tea tree oil in it, but it does not work as advertised. I am now using homeopathic remedies on my itchy, dry scalp such as applying this: Simmer 12 tbsp. plain, old fashioned oatmeal in 6 cups boiling water for an hour. Strain oatmeal, reserving the cooking water to which you then add 5 drops rosemary and 5 drops lavender oil. I have also substituted warm virgin olive oil for those two oils, and mixed 1/2 C. of the reserved oatmeal water with 6 Tbs. apple cider vinegar. Allow mixture to cool before applying to scalp. Leave in hair at least 10 minutes before washing out. You can use this once a week to relieve dry scalp."
2,Did Not Help My Dandruff,"I was recommended this product to eliminate my dandruff. The first time I used it, I used only a quarter-sized amount of the shampoo twice, and I still had my dandruff. THe next time I used the shampoo, I used more than half a dollar-sized amount, nothing. What a waste of money."
4,Works great for Problem Scalp,"My husband has eczema on his scalp which gives him a lot of problems. (Itching, scaliness) I gave him this shampoo to see if it would help and he loves it. It works great. His eczema has calmed down, and he asks me to order this shampoo again and again. He also uses the conditioner.I can't say much about what it does for manageability and softness- he has really short hair. But if you are looking for something to help with a problem scalp, this may be the solution."
3,I don't know if this working,Been using this every time I wash my hair for a month now. I still feel the itch. I don't know if it's working. It seems to less tea tree oil in this one than Nature's gate. The smell is ok - not amazing. Very light and delicate - much like the shampoo! I won't buy this again!
4,works well,"this has helped with breakouts on my face. I'm pretty sure its because my hair isn't as oily so its causing less oil on my face. Whatever the reason, I like the shampoo. It doesn't smell the best but it gets your hair feeling squeaky clean."
1,Did not help dandruff or scalp at all,I bought this hoping that the tea tree would help stop the dandruff and stop the flaking on my scalp...it didn't. It also left my hair tangled after washing. Would not buy again.
1,Very harsh and irritating to my scalp,"For me, this product does the opposite of what it says. My scalp itch and dandruff got 10x worse when using this shampoo. I stuck with it for 2 weeks thinking that maybe the itch was just my scalp getting used to the shampoo but I had to give up when my scalp itch became unbearable and dandruff got much worse than just using a cheap off the shelf dandruff shampoo. Maybe my skin is just sensitive to the tea tree oil or I'm allergic to it, I don't know: so maybe it works for others but I had to rate it for me personally. If this happened to me, I'm sure it'll happen to others. I have to conclude it is pretty harsh if my skin reacts this way to it. I've never reacted this way to other dandruff shampoos and I've tried many. Be careful!"
4,An Awesome Book,"Even with only a basic knowledge of Spanish vocabulary, this book is still entertaining and provides an excellent oppertunity to expand you vocabulary. You pick up new words as you go along and become accustomed to other words that are familiar to you but not yet a part of your vocabulary. This book comes fully equipped with a glossary, single word translations in each selection, and questions at the end of each story that check your understanding. I highly recommend this book for aspiring Spanish speakers."
3,"Great drive, great price, lousy software","I would gladly give this drive 5 stars for value and performance, except for the ""RetroSpect"" software that comes with it. The major problem is that this is an external hard drive, but the software doesn't recognize that as a valid form of media (no wonder it was free): it only recognizes tapes, removeable media (like Zips),etc.I can do ""copy & paste"" backups, and will probably have to start using the XP backup utility, because RetroSpect seems to be the wrong software for this product, and refuses to work."
4,Spandau at their best,Perhaps one of the most talented bands from Britain. Each Track from Chant No.1 moves into territory no one else was exploring. Listen To Paint Me Down and see if you do not agree
2,Too Much Sent,People with smell sensitivity may not like this product. One of the company's other shampoo isn't as strong!
3,Good Deal,Body wash has a very strong smell to it. You get a lot for your money with this. I bought this for the reviews that said it works on acne. It started out working on it but after multiple uses I think it made my skin worse.
4,Typical Print refill for inkjet printer,"I found this refill for the yellow cartridge in my canon BJC-6000 printer very typical. As usual, I feel the ink doesn't last very long and the printer doesn't utilyze the ink efficiently. The price is about what expect to pay for this kind of refill. I have yet to try the generic alternatives, but this refill is pretty good, but not great of course."
3,Some Good Moments,"There is no doubt it. Pat Benatar as one powerful voice. And she even illicits some sweet tones from moment to moment in her songs. However, after a while her routine all sounds the same with not as much passion as one would like. The instrumental backing is passable but nothing spectactular. Fire and Ice is my fave on this batch and Evil Genius is a hidden gem. The title track isn't bad and the cover of Helter Skelter is pretty strong. However as the whole this batch just isn't very distinguishing. Fans of this artist will appreciate it though."
1,This ...,"I've have this cartridge for over 2 years now and have changed the ink tanks about 4 or 5 times. Then, all of a sudden, tha damn thing doesn't print any blue. I tried everything I could think of to try to save it, and nothing works. Now I'm forced to spend almost another $... to buy a new cartridge just for the ink head. That .... Canon better get their stuff together and start making products that last. Or else they're gonna lose even more customers."
1,This is just pure garbage,"Canon makes things that look good in the store, seem reasonable on the price, but when you take them home, they fall apart. Such is the case with the BC-21e cartridge. This thing cost as much as the printer itself, and mine FAILED after only 3 replacements. I don't abuse my equipment. I use it for normal tasks. Canon's product was just not ready for regular use.It would be nice if most people are as fortunate as the last reviewer, who has been able to use this past 5 ink-cartridge changes. Unfortunately, from my experience, I think that's more the exception to the rule.Stay away from Canon. It's a roll of the dice that you are probably going to end up losing."
1,Thanks for saving me money and hassels!,"After reading the other reviews, I've decided to box up thisBJC2110 and drop it off at the thrift store. HP here I come! Use a HP Desk Jet 990CSE at work and it's the cat's meow."
1,happy with price but did not last long,i would like a refund because the item only lasted about 3 months. Previous printheads had lasted over a year.
3,Good price on the cartridge,"Good buy from Amazon on the cartridge.However, Canon has a cash cow here. The cartridge lasts for maybe 5 tank changes before it must be replaced. Add the cost of the cartridge to the cost of the tanks and soon, it's time to start thinking about replacing the Canon printer with one that isn't as expensive to maintain."
1,Terrible product,"Trying to crush tablets into powder to add to a tube feeding was very difficult with this product and those designed like it. You must repeatedly screw down on the twist-in cap, which is hard on the wrists. By the time I'm done my wrists hurt and the pills are a gravely consistency. If you only have soft pills to crush, it may work for you. Good luck with this type!"
1,Deceptive and dishonest,"Having read several books by the authors featured in this DVD, I have to agree with Monday Addams - Robert Schoch, Walter Cruttenden, Graham Hancock etc must have been horrified to see the way their views have been misrepresented. They agree, in the main, with the 10,000 BC date for the end of the Ice Age, and contend that civilization is much older than is generally believed.The makers of this DVD seem to be promoting the view of James Nienhuis that the Ice Age ended much later, around 2,000 BC, which is not supported by any scientific evidence that I'm aware of. Out of curiosity I googled this author and sure enough, he's a Christian fundamentalist seeking to prove the Biblical creation story.Anyone trying to decide if there's any truth in the legends of Atlantis would be well advised to look further afield, and further back in time."
3,Hit or Miss,"I bought this 3-disc set because I had heard the first two tracks of Disc 1 while waiting for my drink at a coffee shop and instantly liked it. Unfortunately, those first two tracks ended up being my favorite. The likeability is spotty: only about ten percent of the tracks are truly innovative renditions of the original classics, meaning they are recognizable as Beatles songs, but made to sound more festive by the different spin that the reggae influence provides. I expected this reggae retake to predominate, but many songs don't seem strongly rooted in the genre. Taken as a whole, it's relaxing and fun to listen to, though I would prefer the convenience of a single disc and more of a reggae twist."
1,New ingredients make hair OILY,"Have used Pureology for years. Last order was a disappointment. Must wash hair daily because the product now makes my hair too oily. Check front of bottle.I looked and sure enough, it now mentions for dry hair. I would love to know if they still make the previous formula (my 2 x a week formula)."
5,Perfect,"I've been using pureology for my curly, dyed hair for years.Quick delivery.Only a small amount of product needed.Will continue using this."
4,The best for permed and colored hair!,Pureology makes the BEST shampoos but their Restore version works better for me than this Hydrate version. I will buy the Restore one from now on. It is expensive but lasts a long time - probably two years at least. My hair is permed and colored and this is the only shampoo which keeps the color from fading and really restores the hair.
5,great stuff!,This shampoo is a little on the pricey side but it really is great shampoo-it does not fade your color treated hair and also smells great! The conditioner is also recommended!
1,CORNY,JAY Z HAS MADE LAME (...) SONGS SINCE IN MY LIFE TIME VOL 1 BUT THIS PUSHES IT. RAP ISNT MEANT TO BE PLAYED UNPLUGGED IT DEFEATS THE PURPOSE.IT SOUNDS CORNY AS (...)
3,"Not bad, but a couple problems.","There are a couple major flaws with this album. First there are too many instruments... is that a flute I hear? The biggest problem I see is the song selection. Instead of choosing more songs with long solos like Takeover, and Aint No, there are the songs with videos attached to them instead, like Izzo, Girls x3, and Big Pimpin. The joint with Mary was a nice surprise. I would have preferred more old jams with low deep beats... more MCing, less 15-year-old girls screaming in the background."
2,say whut,not that great...buy the blueprint 1 not the blueprint 2 the gift and the curse instead of this cuz its actually better...this coulda been better but im not a huge fan of the roots.thats my word.
2,not as good as i thought,"okay, first of all i'm no jay-z fan but i like some of his songs and some of them where on this one so i thought that it would be better bying this one instead of his others. i was VERY wrong because jay-z is just horrible live, he's voyse is so annoying. i gave it 2 stars because there are some nice songs on it but i will never buy another unplugged jay-z album. if you are a great jay-z fan you should like this."
4,pretty good(4.5 stars),some songs are way too short.But songs are goodshould have put other songs on like Jigga Whatif you are a jay-z fan then getif ur not still get this
2,Disappointing,Bought this attachment for my Delta contractors saw and was disappointed. It is farely easy to install but once it is in place it leaves a crack about one half inch wide along each side running from the front to back. There are two heavy steel spacers that go on each side to fill in the void but they are not wide enough for some reason and the crack is just wide enough for saw dust to fall through to the floor. This crack serves no purpose that I can think of and I plan to cover it with duct tape or something to see if it will solve the problem.
5,An Excellent Single by a Promising New Artist,"Tara Lyn Hart's 1999 single shows the promise of a great new artist. Unfortunately, the album never was released and I assume it never will be. (I searched the Web in vain for months, wating for the album!)I realize that record companies must made a large investment, and take a corresponding gamble, on new artists, but Tara Lyn definitely has what it takes to be a successful country music recording artist, and I was very disappointed when an album never came out.(The same is true for artist Shannon Brown, whose 1998 country music single showed great promise; again, no album was ever released.)"
2,More flawed than I remembered,"We bought this as another movie to watch in the Christmas season. I remembered some real laughs and some touching moments from seeing it originally.Upon watching it again I realized what a formula piece it is, with weak writing and abrupt mood and scene changes.As the family was verbally beating up on Sarah Jessica Parker I actually began groaning and longing for it to be over. Thereare some fun scenes but the movie is so politically correct it lacks humans, at least really likeable ones."
1,Have not viewed it yet,Have not seen the video at this time I just hope that it is of better quality that the Home for the Holidays
2,"Boring, terrible snooze fest :-(","The only saving grace to this movie for me, was seeing Luke Wilsons stunning face (and the scene without his shirt on).As with most movies that have incredible casts 4+ top actors), the movie tends to lack a whole bunch of something. This was long winded and boring and slow and I thought I'd love it because of the cast, but it didn't help.Sarah Jessica should have known better, and Dianne Keaton's role was silly and lately, it's what I've come to expect from Dermot Mulrooney. Rachael McAdams was a complete B and Claire Danes was completely superfluous. The ending was totally predictable and this was the biggest waste of time and money in a long time.I don't like to write negative reviews, but I'm sorry; there isn't too many positives I can write about this. Don't waste your time on this bad bad movie."
1,"miscast, actors did not fit their roles","This tries to be a comedy and it is if you are able to laugh at an elderly mother (Diane Keaton) spouting filthy language. The plot features a man bringing his fiance home for Christmas to meet the family. The sad part is the people are all middleaged, but behave worse than kids. The groom to be's brother falls in love with the fiance after observing her drunk and dirty dancing. His receding hairline reminds us he is too old for this nonsense. Next the groom to be falls in love with his fiance's sister. One wonders why he is smitten as the sister is masculine enough to compete in Roller Derby. And how many comedies end with mommy dying of cancer? As for political correctness the producers covered all their bases with one actor who is gay, handicapped and black. Appealing scenery, costumes, background music and good acting are absent. This is a movie I consider pathetic."
1,Who is giving this thing good reviews?,"This movie was extremely bad. The only reason I can imagine why this movie got any good reviews at all is because people that stand to benefit from the movie's success are padding the vote. The reasons the family doesn't like Meredith are rediculous (clearing her throat????). The big blow up at the dinner table over the question ""why would you want your child to be gay?"" made me want to eject the dvd and break it in half. And then, as if things weren't horrible enough, Meredith's sister shows up and everyone turns into swingers (Meredith hooks up with the brother and Everett hooks up with the sister) one night out of the blue. I would definately recommend this movie....be moved from the 5 dollar bin to the 2 dollar bin."
2,The Trailer's Better,"Gosh its was promising but they did it all wrong!Im not giving anything away but if you want to see a movie full of annoying characters (no one you will like,really) and unrealistic situations,then check this one out.Forget the cast,this one is BAD.Dont waste your money.Trust me,I started watching this movie expecting to have an enjoyable 90 minutes and I finished it feeling annoyed.So there,you've been warned.And yes,im one of those people who felt relieved,Diane Keaton's character died in the end."
3,Just a little off,"A real tearjerker, this all-star ensemble movie just misses because there's something slightly false at its core. You're never sure exactly what keeps the family so close, and their antipathy towards the Sarah Jessica Parker uptight character doesn't make a whole lot of sense, other than that she is played as an unlikeable person. It's also not much of a comedy, so what is it exactly? That's the problem here. Still, it's an interesting watch."
4,worth watching this holiday movie,"Fun movie, we liked it more than we thought we would. A nice holiday movie thought the acting for a few could be better."
5,terrific movie,I seriously thought that this was one of the funniest movies I had seen in a long time. And the number of stars involved was terrific.
2,Outrageous,"With 167 reviews in the can already, I can only say that I really hated this movie. Thankfully, I saw it on DVD and was able to stop whenever I wanted, which was often. The movie was simply overdone to the point of viewer exhaustion. If you have to see it, rent it or catch it on a movie channel. Don't waste your money on this bad flick."
1,Hollywood garbage,"This movie introduces the audience to a large family that is struggling to accept the mate of one of their sons. This movie has the typical Hollywood character traits: Marijauna advocacy, parents and children converse about their sexual experiences, and homosexuality. This movie has an overused plot. This movie lacks even a hint of original humor. Its a waste of your money and if you believe in traditional family values you will be disgusted with it in the first ten minutes."
1,bad,"What a bad movie the Family Stone is. It's unfunny, unbearable, and unentertaining. It's a really bad movie that tries hard to be something it's not, and that's a comedy movie. The fact that some romantic elements were thrown in for bad measure makes the movie that much worse. Please, avoid."
2,"Nice Cast, Weak Movie","Given the cast I had high expectations for this movie, but unfortunately it didn't deliver. The storyline and plot twists are totally unbelievable even given the most disfunctional of families. There are some nice perfomances, granted, and for this reason alone I gave it two stars. But even with that grace, it's not enough to warrant giving it the 100 minutes of your life to watch."
5,Loved It,"I haven't enjoyed a movie this much in many years. It's both funny and touching, the director hit one out of the park. The acting is superb, especially Wilson and Parker. I acknowledge that the plot is unbelieveable, in this case that just doesn't matter, it's all about the questions this movie provokes in the viewer. This movie asks us whether we are living our lives for someone else or for for ourselves? Are we being true to ourselves in our choices in love and career, or instead doing what we're supposed to? Are we judging others? If so do we judge people using society's values, our family's values? Really good movie,!"
1,Blech!!!,"The acting was great, but this was literally the worst movie I have ever seen *and I saw Alien vs. Predator* I mean, literally when this movie was over I wasted no time in returning it to the video store, as i didn't want the vileness of the ridiculous, ludicrous, and utterly LAME excuse for a story defiling my living room."
2,"It was OK, but","I really didn't like the story line. Sarah Jessica (Carrie) ... I wouldn't have recognized her. She looked awful in the whole film. Tell her next time to use the make up artist and hair stylist she had in Sex in the City.The film was weird. A crazy family who was always fighting and out of sorts. I couldn't tell who was who. OK, the mom was ill, but the family didn't know it in the beginning and they were still weird and unpleasant. Their attitude towards SJP was disgusting.Not a good choice for SJP. She's best in comedy and should stick to it."
1,Big series of cliches,"Perhaps I have trouble with this kind of humor, but I found it dull and ""draggy"" with acting that was very disappointing. The plot was one big cliche after another and it could be a long time before I see another Sarah Jessica Parker movie attempt."
3,A very real film,"I can't say that I didn't enjoy this movie, however I don't know if I would watch it all the time.It takes the meeting of your boyfriends parents to a whole new level. It really does make you feel like you are Sarah Jessica Parker and being hated by an entire family! It is funny, sad and then at times extremely awkward.If you like Sarah Jessica Parker, then you will love this movie, she definately does a great job in this film.If you are looking for a movie in which you can relate to and laugh and cry at, then this is your kind of film!"
3,:0) 3.5 stars,has a typical storyline but i shed some tears at the end didn't think i would like it but i did.. i think Diane Keaton did a good job as a mother ..the part that made me loved her more...was at the dinner table when she was encouraging the gay son after what had happen....
5,"Witty, spot-on family dynamics",I adore this movie. The family dynamics are wonderfully written and very entertaining. We watch this movie every year at Christmas time. A must see!
3,it is a cute song,The song is so cute i totally support the young singers they are trying to do their best. Lil'Reema is so cute in it.
4,A Good Half Read,"This was an interesting book played out on an interesting stage with a main character who is not a hero, a bit of a chicken who makes questionable half decisions. Like the authors other books, I could not put it down. Though it is called, ""Half a Life"", I was not prepared for it end at the half way point! I'd like the other half please---"
3,Is a half a life better than none?,"This novel ends with its protagonist at the age of forty-one. Is his life half over? Willie Chandran is the son of a Brahmin who marries far out of his caste. His father's choice of a life that he thought would mirror Gandhi's has proven to be one of disappointment and embarrassment. Willie's life choices, starting with his escape from India, lead to a life of aimless wandering and hiding from an understanding of who he really is.Naipaul`s novel is an interesting commentary on life's continual journey; that which moves forward despite the fact that many have no idea of where the path will lead them. I wish that I cared more for Willie, as his predicament would have held more emotional meaning, as a character study this is a well-done but distant novel."
2,Stylish look but bad reception,"I live in a major metro area in the NW and can get a clear signal about 10 percent of the time. I live on a hill and the weather doesn't seem to be a factor. That would not be so bad, but adjusting the time manually is quite complicated. Save the watch manual for reference! The pure-silver version of this watch looks nice but with most watches being very accurate, ""downloading"" the absolute correct time is pointless."
3,Just ok,Interesting at first but lacked detail and got boring towards the end. Ok if you are interested in anything of this genre.
5,Title for my review,"Funny look at golfing. One has to have a sense of humor toplay the game anyway and these cartoons show the humoroustruisms associated with the ""game."""
4,this one stuck with me...,"I don't know why, but this book has stuck w/me thru the years. I read it once, years ago, when I was in elementary school (I graduated high school in 1983 if that's any clue as to the many, many years that have passed since then!). I don't remember details, but I remember much - the storyline, the main character, subplots, emotions... it was the emotions that brought this book back to me today. I am going thru a ""fitting in"" issue right now, as was Carol in the book, and the story came flooding back. Of course, at this point - some 30+ (oh-my-gosh, I'm that old?) years later - I cannot attest to the writing quality, the flow of words, the desciptive state (altho I believe it was quite vivid and detailed), so to give the story a 5 star rating would be unjust until I read it again. However, the fact that I remember so much - that this story stuck w/me enough for me to even remember the title, then it must have been good. At least it was for the little girl I was back then."
4,LOVED IT!,"I really enjoyed this book. I got it on CD from the Library and was hesitant because I did not care for Big Stone Gap. In fact, I couldn't even finish Big Stone Gap it! I was also surprised that some reviewers are indorsing reading Dogs of Babel, Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-They are COMPLETELY different reads! I thought this was a beautiful story. Loved the setting, characters ect. Could even imagine the 'plumbers crack' of Kits nephew! Read this book for what it is: Nostalgia of Greenwich Villages in the 50's and the story of the Italian family that is living there with their customs, arguments and secrets. Makes me want to go have some spaghetti!"
4,Loved Lucia! What a woman!!,Story is well written and really pulls at the heartstrings! What a picture of the times and the cultural expectations placed on women in the 50's. I love everything I've read by this author.
4,Good light read,"This book reminded me so much of my mother's stories from NY in the 1950s! If you have some old relative (yiddish, jewish, italian, hispanic, black, whatever) and you love to hear their stories, you'll like this book. Yes, the plot is filled with cliches-- women must remain virgins until they're married, devout Catholic families are intensely suspicious, old-world men frown upon career girls, a mother's only job is to serve her husband and marry off her kids, we're forbidden to marry outside our culture. The book over-dramatizes these cultural elements, but it adds amusement to the plot. It's not Shakespeare, but it's very entertaining and packs much more historical and cultural depth than that trash Danielle Steele and Judy Blume write. You can tell that the author did her research!"
4,Be Transported Back to the 50s,"This heartfelt story follows the life of Lucia, a young woman who grew up in New York in the 1950s. We learn about her life as a young woman dealing with stereotypes and her battles against them. The novel starts with Lucia, present day, talking with another tenant in the apartment building she currently resides in. We are then taken back to the 1950s, when life for a woman was much more difficult than it is today. Take the journey with Lucia as she deals with life, death and loss. A wonderful read, if you're looking for something to touch you deeply and make you feel young again."
5,DELIGHTFUL!,"I ABSOLUTELY LOVED ""LUCIA, LUCIA""! FOR ME IT HAD EVERYTHING: IDID LAUNDRY WITH LUCIA, COOKED WITH LUCIA, CRIED WITH LUCIA BUTDIDN'T LOVE WITH LUCIA. I SUSPECTED JOHN TALBOT FROM THE START.HER BEING EMPLOYED BY B. ALTMAN BROUGHT BACK MEMORIES FOR ME SINCE I WAS A CUSTOMER AT ONE TIME. HER FAMILY WAS MY FAMILYAND THE SEEMINGLY NEVER ENDING FOOD WAS ALSO FAMILIAR. I WASTOTALLY INVOLVED WITH ""LUCIA"" AND I CAN'T WAIT FOR ""QUEEN OF THEBIG TIME"" TO HIT THE BOOKSTORES."
4,What a lovely time,"Adriana does an excellent job of transporting the reader back to the Greenwich Village of the 50s. This is a delightful novel and I read it in two sittings. The story unfolds beautifully and although Kit's love interest was a predictable character, I enjoyed reading about their relationship. Ms. Tigiani does an excellent job capturing the emotions of these characters and I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a fast read that can hold your attention."
4,delightful nostalgia,"i really liked this book alot because i know and knew people in her situation years ago. the nostalgia of the old department stores and the village is wonderful. i really wanted her to end her life differently and was disappointed. however, it was a good, fun read."
4,Oi Oi !!! Those were the days !!,"One of the best of the oi bands ,these guys were probably a bit more sincere than some of the later bands down the road. Roi later went on to the 4skins and left his mark on that band as well. If you are looking for pristine musicanship look elsewhere, but if its in your face punk that is honest and without apology buy this one.. Long live oi!!!"
4,Excellent Photography and Enjoyable Reading,"Just received the book and finished 95% in the first sitting. This book is an excellent starting point, providing excellent descriptions and explanations without getting overly scientific. The book has excellent photography and I definitely recommend it! Excellent resource for pilots and weather-watchers ;)"
1,these ARE NOT real 7 for all mankind jeans!,"these are NOT 7 for all mankind jeans if that's what you are looking for - those jeans go for $125-200 a piece. the people who make these came up with their ""similar"" name to trick you into buying them - they probably figure its a numbers game and ""some"" will just keep them.. dont be fooled - if youre looking for real 7's - go to eluxury.com and you'll find them there."
1,Fun for 10 minutes,"This is all my son wanted for Christmas.... the first time he tried to change the mouth/voice changer, the post broke off inside the first mouthpiece. This is the number one toy of the season and it breaks the first time it's played with..... What a disappointment."
5,All the kids at our Christmas gathering wanted one,"Bought this for my grandson, as am always looking for something different and this toy exceeded all my expectations. All of the kids at our Christmas gathering wanted one, so of course, all the parents were scrambling trying to find one. Unfortunately, all stores were sold out. I highly recommend this for anyone looking for some fun. Even the adults were entertained and trying it out."
1,The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air Seasons 1& 2,I returned the CDs to the distributor because the wrong season was mailed to me. I requested seasons 3&4. I received seasons 1&2. Have not heard from the distributor since returning product or got the correct seasons mailed to me.
1,Fresh Prince Seasons 1 & 2,"I never received the items although my credit card was charged!I emailed the seller door2doordvds, and did not reeive a response.Melony"
5,not the popular point of view,"so, i listened to portishead before i ever heard dummy. i'd have to say that i like it much more than dummy. i know people think it's not as good as dummy, and now that i have both, i can see why, but portishead will always be my favorite. the music just lulls you into a world that is all at once comfortable and strange...any kind of music that can do that is okay in my book."
2,"Darker Than Dummy, a Scary Sequel","I gave this album two stars for a very simple reason. I dont desire to play it often in my cd player. I couldnt get Dummy out of my system for 6 months straight! Yet, this album was digested in less than a month. I gave it an honest listen. It is not without highlights, check out the big band sound of ALL MINE. For the most part though, you may feel as though you are listening to the background sounds of a haunted house. There is an artistic integrity to delving into the deep and dark places on an album, but this one sinks so far down that I dont bother to visit it often."
5,Favorite Portishead album,This is my favorite portishead album for this particular album has some of portishead's darkest more desperate tracks. Totally recommended.
5,The intensity is overwhelming,"This is one of my favorite albums. It's not the kind of music you can just play casually for anyone. The listener must be open-minded. The setting must be right as well. This isn't driving music or dance music. It's almost performance art. My family spent a couple of years in Europe during the 60s. This album takes me there. It reminds me of going to the movies to see James Bond and Alphaville with Lemmy Caution. I get a whole European black-and-white vibe from this album. It's dark and exciting. I love Beth Gibbons' voice, especially when it sounds like it's about to break. The intensity is overwhelming. Sit back, relax, be quiet, and listen."
4,Shining via dimmer,"Solid synth-spook abound, as the former trip-hop's accessibly sour tone is grimed and slowed further down. It may not be the revolution Dummy was, or even as far ranging and pretty, but is still nearly as consistent a follow up possible, definitely worthy of name recognition, unlike their latest."
5,impossible to find. It wasn't available on itunes until recently.,"Nice for old school hip hop lovers. A combination of wu-tang meets bjork. Interesting and doesn't disappoint.Great Album!! Buy, Buy, Buy!!!"
2,jinx,"In the three years following Portishead's first album about 1 billion trillion bands ripped off the portishead sound... Or tried to.Postishead reponded with this lame effort. I barely remember it. I think it had one mediocre song and a bunch of really bad ish. The singer decided to rip off Barbara Streisand instead of billy holiday. wtf?I have yet to check the third album. even though it was released six months ago. this sophmore record is THAT BAD1.5 stars.(the best band to deliver that ""portishead"" sound was LAMB who mixed a beefy style of creative DnB with the style. Locust also had a dope mix by Boom Boom satalites that did a grunge rock take on the sound. you can also go back in time and peek Skinhead Oconner, Suzi Sioux and Cocteau Twins first album if you like P-head roots muzak)"
3,"If you have others, this one is superfluous","Am a huge fan of Portishead but after having the Live at Roseland and Dummy, this one is just an add-on. i don't get much energy from hearing it- for some reason the other two albums complete the picture for me. If you're a fan, go ahead and get it but it doesn't really expand one's P-head horizons much."
3,reader from Arizona,"Return to Love addressed many important themes, didn't pull any punches or sugar-coat the subjects. A worthwhile read, but some of the writing could have been stronger. I felt too many scenes were ""told"" rather than ""shown"". Especially glossed over were some of the most emotional scenes between Trevor and Janna. Instead of giving the reader a word by word, blow by blow (emotional, not physical) description of some of the actual interaction between these two characters, we were simply told ""such and such passed between them"", then read the after effects of the scene, which left me with a bit of a dissatisfied feeling. I would like to have gotten under the characters' skins more, experienced what they were experiencing in some of these dramatic scenes, rather than simply be ""told"" a scene happened. Still, given the topics Return to Love tackled, I thought it overall a worthwhile read."
4,Dont like the stages,"Dont like the stages . When I put this perfume, it smells strong, licorice . If I use to much makes me sick, so I have to go easy with this. Then after the licorice, you can tell each smell . But at the end, YEEEES, that was the smell I was waiting for. Very yummy! This can be the first thing you do when toy are planning to go out, after you shower. By the time you are done doing your makeup, hair, dressing.... You will be smelling so yummy, and sweet. Another way to do it is spraying tie clothes the night before. It will have a soft sweet smell, that I can't resist. But, now that I tried the original and the sensual... I prefer the sensual, more of a grown up smell. Even though you are add old as you feel. The sensual, I doesn't go threw all these different stages that you have to wait for the final result of this yummy scent. Good price, the smell stays for long time."
5,We love this series!,"Oh, my, the scrapes and situations Victor Muldrew finds himself in... Too funny for words sometimes. My husband and I laughed so hard at the Christmas special that we had to put it on pause until we got finished laughing enough to continue. The story lines are written so that they interweave and come full circle - where DO the writers come up with some of these ideas! Fine acting by both main characters and I agree with another reviewer that this is NOT just for old people! Most episodes have social commentary hidden underneath that makes you think and the difference is the Mr. Muldrew doesn't take it lying down but lets others know how he feels about things. Really enjoyable series."
2,New formula added cheap fillers and chemical fragrance,"I was excited to get my order until I realized it was a new formula. The packaging says new and improved... but it is new and ruined in my opinion. Now they added hydrogenated palm kernel oil and perfume (fragrance), it use to have natural fragrance oils. I have really oily and sensitive skin. Anything with fragrance makes my face explode with red pimples. It takes a week for the reaction to go away. I switched to Avalon organics products now because there is nothing hydrogenated in it or any chemical fragrances that cause irritation. I'm not even going to take the chance with this product to use it. I just know what makes my skin react and those ingredients are exactly what I don't want on my face. If you have non oily or non sensitive skin then I think you will be happy with the product.Sucks because I really loved the old formula and it made my face happy!"
3,Really strong smell,"I gave it three stars just to be fair as I cannot rate it as an anti-wrinkle cream because I cannot use it. I wanted to love this cream, but the smell is so strong that I just cannot take it. Not only is is strong smelling, it is also very strong as a cream...my face had a small break-out from it and that never happens to me. This cream has a lot of great reviews so it may, in fact, work great... but not if you cannot tolerate the smell. Buy it,try it, but know this info first."
1,Way to stongly scented,"I bought this product this evening wanting to use a natural product that was not tested on animals. I have used some other Jason products and have been very satisfied. I have even used the Ester-C toner, which smells like a creamsickle. The Ester-C scent started to permiate the room. The next thing I new I have a headache and cannot get the smell out of my head. This is very unpleasant. I am not a sensative person so you can imagine just how strong this is. I am very dissapointed in a product that claims to be ""natural"" how can you have such a strong perfumed scent?"
4,A novel that has it's finger on the pulse of the civil rights movement,"I really enjoy historical fiction, especially about the American South. This was an enlightening read for surmising the social/political atmosphere of the deep south during the turbulent civil rights movement. I will keep this one in my library and read it again in the future."
2,Hard to Keep Track of the Characters,"In the author's note, Sena Naslund writes that she wanted to ""write about the acts of courage and tragedy"" that took place in Birmingham where she was a college student. I feel she did a very good job of portraying the difficult choices people involved in the civil rights movement had to make and the effect of those choices and the courage it took. For this, the book is worth reading.I had difficulty however with keeping track of the various characters and who they were, for some reason. It is a long book, but even by the end I often felt myself saying, ""now who is that again"". I just didn't feel engaged with the characters, they are not ones who will stick with me."
1,Read the dates of the reviews before buying!,"You might notice that the newer reviews are harsher than the older ones. I just purchased this from Circuit City and it does not work. I tried a variety of rooms, remotes and configurations and only time it worked was then the remote was less than 6 inches from the sender unit.As a side note...I have tried to write this review on CC's website and I keep getting an error message...yet the ratings on CC's website are very high- shady."
5,"Simple set up, functional, reliable - what's not to like?",Took about 5 minutes to set up. I'm flummoxed as to why anyone would have trouble setting up/using this. Plug the sending & receiving units in & attach the repeater(s). I'm using it to control the DirecTV DVR in the living room that feeds the signal in my bedroom - works flawlessly every time. Never had a problem at all. It was *extremely easy* to set up. Couldn't be happier (especially at this price point)!As an aside to everyone who is having trouble aiming their remote at the sending unit - make sure it's oriented correctly. The unit must be placed with the slim end (opposite of the end with the power attachment) exposing the red plastic for IR reception. Not very intuitive - especially since it looks similar to some indoor TV antennas which are usually oriented with the logo exposed (as in the picture for this item).
3,A somewhat Risky Purchase,"I purchased this product recently to allow control of my Sony DVD Player and Denon AV Receiver in an adjoining room. The feature of extending the remote into other rooms is nice. I found that the direction is fairly picky for both the transmitter and receiver. You have to be pretty much straight on. The sticky pads to put on the devices infared sensors make the product usable. My major problem with the unit, however, is that it has started to inadvertently change my Denon receiver settings. It is somehow picking up noise and changing my receiver settings every now and then. This may or may not affect your device (my DVD player hasn't had any problems) but it's an annoying problem if it does so."
5,Great Product At Twice The Price!,"After returning a Radioshack remote extender, I was a bit hesitant to try another remote extender but this one really works! I paid twice the price at the Best Buy store and I am going to order my second one from here, now that I know how well it works. Easy setup and I didn't have to use the extra wired ir pickup. The device is so small that it is hardly noticible. The antenna, if you need to extend it at rotates 180 degrees around the unit. Nice job Trek Mfg."
1,"Plain and simple, does not work","I had high hopes for this product, but got absolutely no results, I have to hold the remote 5 ft max from the reciever and it takes 5 or 6 button pushes to get it to work. The LED's on the product are inconsistent with the description in the instructions, overall, im highly dissapointed :( The packaging is the cut your finger off hard plastic that you need a machette to cut open, which makes it impossible to return :(( DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT"
2,not good as expected,"The receiver couldn't sense any infrared signal >5~6ft away from the remote control. Unless you can/would put the receiver really close, it's useless!!"
1,Sharpshooters only!!!,This is by far the worst item I ever purchased from Amazon.. the other reveiws are correct; unless you stand a foot or less and point exactly at the unit and I mean exactly; it may work.I had this mounted on the plasma and only 4 feet away; it does not work and you have to press your remote a dozen times and continually move it up and down it may work.I returned this item.
4,"Works well, but not perfect","The product works as described, but is not perfect. It is used with a DirecTV HR21 DVR and a Yamaha Receiver. While it does what it is supposed to do, sometimes you have to press the remote several times. For the price it's performance is acceptable."
1,Don't bother,Complete junk. You have to hold the remote about 2 inches away for it to work. Don't waste your time on this.
