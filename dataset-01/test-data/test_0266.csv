2,Not what I was expecting,"This book had quite a different focus than I expected. That, combined with some poor editing, left me feeling quite ambivalent about it. My wife and I have been curious about the Paris catacombs, and she gave me this book thinking that there would be some information about them. This is a celebration of graffiti and impromptu art that discusses the art in serious terms, often more than I think it warrants. Although some of the official tunnel creation and consolidation is considered, this is minimal in comparison to revelling in the ""kata"" (catacomb) art.There are some dumb editing errors in this book. For instance, on page 28 the final sentence on the page ends midway through. Elsewhere there was are misconstructed sentences. This isn't horrible, but it should have been caught by the editor and degrades the work."
2,not happy it has not been a year since i bought it,"it has not been a total of 12 months since i bought the keyless remote. the plastic in the front where you push to turn on alarm has cracked and last week, it got stuck. car door would not open and i was warming car up since it was cold outside. it like plastic on the front it should not be torning up in less then 12 months. not happy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Great Bible!,I am very delighted with my new Bible! I think it is worth every penny. It is excellent by all respects. No blemish!
4,Nice Bible ... However ...,"I like this bible very much ... although the bible I received is not as big as advertised. It's about an inch shorter and an inch less wide than expected.""Still I like it"""
3,Disappointed,"There was nothing wrong with the bible except that the large print wasn't as large as expected. Unfortunately, we had to return and search for a different one."
5,ZIM'S CRACK CREAM FOR HEELS AND FEET,GREAT PRODUCT. I'M VERY SATISFIED WITH USING IT. RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT IF YOU ARE HAVING PROBLEMS WITH TIGHT SKIN ON YOUR FEET.
2,Meh.,"Meh. It isn't as pretty or as useful asVictorian Lace Today. Although it is more comprehensive than VLT since it includes patterns for sweaters and shawls and gloves, there's nothing that fabulous in here. One major drawback is that they frequently use their own brand of yarn and you'll have to come up with your own substitute based on gague. Also, the shaping on the sweaters is horrific. Someone needs to have a sitdown with Maggie.Knitting in Plain English, Updated EditionEven though the two books are published by the same press, Victorian Lace Today wins."
4,"Beautiful, usseful book",I bought this book because I love to knit lace. I already have Victorian lace today and that book is also a must have for lace knitters.Altough I am only knitting for 2 years the patterns in A Gathering of Lace are well written and do-able. The photographs are of less quality than VLT but still very much worth looking at. There are also some small projects that will finish up quickly. I love both VLT and A Gathering of lace.
5,AN EXTRAORDINARY READING,"Here's an audio version with double listening pleasure - an introduction read by Newbery Medal winning author Lloyd Alexander, and a splendid reading of Book 2 in the imaginative Prydain Chronicles by Royal Scottish Academy trained actor James Langton. What a voice!Scifi for young readers and listeners takes on new dimensions in this intricately plotted and finely executed tale focusing on the challenges faced by Taran, Assistant Pig-Keeper in Caer Dallben.Warriors in Arawn's army seem to be an unbeatable foe - they increase in number daily and never die. Born in the Black Cauldron they appear to be invincible.Taran, accompanied by true friends, sets off for Arawn's home with hopes of destroying the Cauldron.- Gail Cooke"
2,Cause your special Lemon Moist cake review,I baked two packages - both cakes did not rise much at all and werelacking in taste. Will not buy that product again.
2,utterly worthless.,"There's nothing here that you cant find yourself on the netin less than five minutes. This book was written for the kind ofperson that has trouble finding the ""ON"" switch - not a realnetwork administrator. If you know what you're doing, then dontwaste your money."
1,Why isn't there a stand-alone CD?,"I've been waiting forever for a remastering of this album, but I'll continue waiting for a stand-alone CD version. A download isn't enough, and if the suits at Sony think I'll cough up $95 for a deluxe set -- in this economy -- they're nuts. It's especially galling to go through this for an album about working people."
2,Casual fans beware.,"If you are a casual Boss fan, than this album is probably better off being avoided. It's overly dark and moody, and the sound quality is not there. However, the album has good songs, six of the albums' ten tracks appear on the ""Live"" set, and they all sound much better in that format. I specifically found ""Racing in the Street"" and the title track to be significantly better live. Yes the album is deep and somewhat poetic lyrically, but it is missing the chugging ""cars and girls and Saturday night"" songs that are easier on the commercial ear. Die hard Boss backers point to this collection as a near masterpiece, I look at it as a step back."
1,A real good Role Model for our kids,"I find it interesting that the author would make such a wonderful effort to help children, after having murdered parents. I wonder if he sent autographed free copies to the children of the people he murdered.I also find it interesting, that in over 20 years on death row, he was only able to write a handful of ""children's books"".That these books would find their way into our public school systems, where this man takes on the role of Martyr and Folk Hero, speaks volumes about our schools.The book is as shallow as the man who wrote it."
5,Warfare of the Spirit,Sadly this book is out of print. One would think that when a masterpiece is presented to us we would protect it. Tozer has written a message to the established church and the inner church. There is no doubt in my mind which one rejected the message. Warfare is quite possibly the most needed secular book of the times (then or now). A rating of 5 is quite low on a scale of 0-5. I am ashamed as I read this book but exhilerated at the forgiveness GOD offers us. SO SO sad that we use HIS forgiveness as liscense to continue on in our weakness rather then growing in HIS SPIRIT.
5,cat training attempt,"The book has great tips about cat training, I tried to train them but with seven cats at home is a little hard."
1,Frustrating,"I am about to uninstall, both my wife and myself gve this a try. My lot size is not one of the given ones. Setting up a lot (a 90x180 foot rectangle) is impossible. Did not bother going any further, with it. There is a couple of hours wasted I will never see again....."
1,Read the Reviews FIRST - ZERO Stars,"I just now read the reviews of this product; unfortunately, I did not read them before I purchased this pathetic program. Basically - false advertising. Does not include anywhere near the number of items indicated on the box and queries to Broderbund indicate the items are no longer available. Save your money - get some crayons!"
1,Too Complicated,"I wanted very Simple, not 35 steps to something, wanted to replace a pad and paper, but can do it in 5 minute, worked with this a hour and still at a loss"
2,very cheap!!,"I'm very disappointed. It says CEDAR chest, but in reality it is just particle board. Also, the locking mechanism does not work properly. I am planning on sending it back once everything settles down from the holidays."
1,RF Technology Does NOT Work,"I have tried numerous products like this in the past, and after doing hours of research on the technology discovered it is largely unproven and that all this clinical proof they all claim does not exist. The only product that I am aware of that works is the one touch electrolysis pen. Give that a try, or make a professional appointment."
1,Lots of problems with no solutions,"If you look at the preface, the author states ""Despite myriad requests from students for solutions to problems and exercises, we have chosen as a matter of policy not to supply references for problems and exercises, to remove the temptation for students to look up a solution rather than to find it themselves."" Well, gee, thanks mister author, for you so very high opinion of me as a lazy cheater. I guess I'll just come up with the best answers that I can, and just automatically assume that they're right since I have no correct answers to compare them to. I'm sure glad you have such high principles as you sit up in your MIT ivory tower that you will not be swayed by the masses. I grovel in starry admiration of your intellectual genius and moral superiority. Too bad I have to buy your book for my class."
1,"Skimpy, skimpy, skimpy!",This latest set is much skimpier than the ones I bought previously. They are too short (don't stay tucked in) and too small (seem more like a Large or even a Medium).
3,SF Reader,"if you like a novel written with 3 to 5 interelated parallel story lines. then this one is for you. Primarily different groups of astronauts, scientists, military brass and nasa types running around making illogical decisions. A fast read because you want it to be over. I gave it an extra star for excellent editing."
2,"Stick it back in the oven, it's not done yet","After two weeks with my SkyFi3 I'm returning it. On paper this is a great piece of hardware, but the constant lockups and choppy recording of shows make this thing completely frustrating to use. If Delphi hasn't managed to get the bugs worked out after several months on the market they may never get them fixed."
1,pass on this,Unit constantly locked up making it very annoying to have spent money on it. When it did lock up you would have to unplug it and let the charge run out of the battery before you could be started again since there are no hard turn off buttons or a removable battery. I know it's cheap but don't buy it.
5,An astonishing artist!,"I'd encountered this artist in the late 1970's after purchasing 'Valdy and the Hometown Band' in Europe. Unfortunately, I abandoned the album in Tehran shortly afterward and just recently was fortunate enough to find another album on CD through Amazon.The content is exceptional, with many of the tracks from my 'lost' recording. I only wish more offerings from this artist could be found on CD."
1,Keep away from this item,"When I first purchased this item, I paid about $90 a few years ago. It worked great for the first year, but after the warranty ran out, I noticed it started to operate funny. Apparently the little ball bearings were falling out of the sides, prohibiting the smooth and easy operation of the device. Attempts to contact customer service were futile, and I was willing to send it in to have it repaired at any cost to me (providing it did not exceed the cost of a new one!).Stay away from it, as I forgot to mention that the power cord died after a year, and I had to resplice the wires in order to have it charge the device.This was purchased to replace another item that was in an accident, and I will never purchase another. I always had luck with the Philips devices."
4,Efficient but need to experiment,PROS:1. Seems to be efficient2. Sturdy lookingCONS:1. You can not detach the epilator head for cleaning2. Works better plugged in3. Battery lasts approx 30 min4. Difficult to use if hair growth is perpendicular to your bone structure.SUMMARY:Use the epilator while it is charging. You have to try various directions before you figure out what works best - yes I did read the manual end to end before using it - no it didnt work always when you keep the logo facing away from you and running it in the direction of hair growth.If you are used to waxing it hurts less than that - my wife has a very sensetive skin and she didnt feel much when I did her underarms.
4,This Takes Some Getting Used To:,"The first time I used this product it was painful and I really thought I had made a mistake in buying the product, but I persevered. It has become much more tolerable.It seems to work much better on very fine hair, otherwise I get more breaking off than actual extraction.I use the ""Emjoi"" on nearly every part of my body, some parts with more success than others for the reasons I mentioned. I am using it on nearly a weekly basis as the hair grows at different paces. It is much easier to do a little at a time. Perhaps that is why the first couple of times were painful.I will continue to use this as I love not having to shave every day!"
4,Emjoi Hair Remover,"I thought the previous reviews were helpful and I find this hair remover to be really good. It does hurt as it is an epilator, doesn't remove the really fine hairs, but it does a good job overall. I wish it were more angled to the bikini area, but I find it works well for underarms and legs."
3,To Small,"This tiller is to small for anything but flower & postage stamp size gardens. I hate the fact it has no nuetral gear which makes it impossible to move without starting the engine. It has one speed only, SLOW!!! Not really adequate for a real garden. To expensive for the limited use."
5,Great Weeding Tool,"I love this weeder! Very aggressive, but doesn't damage surrounding plants. I have not had any problems with it bending or breaking. Have given several to friends as gifts. Would be lost without it."
2,"Handy size, but bends and breaks","This tool is really a great size for weeding, but they bend easily and I have broken several of them."
2,Worked really well until it snapped.,"Soil wasn't that hard, and the blade wasn't that deep. I had a lot of leverage, but the dandelion had more. Love the handle and adore my NRG digging fork, but i won't be buying a replacement, as i came here to do today, because of all the reports of similar breakage of the blade."
5,Heart Steps,"Great Book for any artist, author etc. Julia Cameron is in my opinion one of the best encourager for all people in the arts of any field... would highly recommend any of her books..."
3,"(Mostly) good analysis, poorly written","The authors demolish an easy target, Latin American populism, with well-worn but good arguments.The snag is that the book is rambling, boring, and confusing. For much better books from a similar ideological standpoint, read something by Jean-Francois Revel or Mario Vargas Llosa (Alvaro's father)."
5,Great Problems for Pondering the Greatness of Geometry,In a very well organized fashion the authors have amassed a fabulous collection of geometry problems that are quite challenging indeed. Although most high schoolers will likely have difficulty it can be used wisely as a study tool since they have sections for hints and finally a solutions section. It should be noted that other solutions are possible but the ones given are very easy to follow. A fun time for all geometry teachers (like me) and good students.
4,Exegesis,I liked how the author wrote the book in e-mail messages. It made you fill in the blanks that he left because he didn't describe anything. It was a fast paced book that i enjoyed alot. The only part that i didn't really like was the ending because it didn't tell you what happened to Alice. Other than the ending it was a good book :)
4,A new format for an old theme.,"The format of Exegesis (a series of email messages) got me to buy it. The first pages were so intriguing that I showed my officemate and said ""Read these."" But that didn't last long, unfortunately. As the rogue AI gets more and more philosophical, he gets less and less interesting (to me). I collect ""rogue AI"" stories, and for the first time I found myself more interested in the human character than the AI. I don't care if there are two Edgars or not, I want to know what happened to Alice. So, despite the attractive narrative, this one failed me on two fronts - an AI that didn't capture my interest, and a story that fails to tell me what I want to know about the human."
1,I'm glad I read it in the store instead of buying it,"I'm waiting for the day when popular media (books, movies, tv) can convey e-mail communication realistically and without continually jabbing the viewer in the side to say, 'see me? I'm CYBER!' I'm still waiting. The book might've made a cute short story, but as a novel it was draggy and did nothing to make me care about the characters or what happened to them."
2,Basic - perhaps too basic.,"This kids book does an adequate job of introducing the relationships in a traditional nuclear family. It includes grandparents, uncles, aunts, and cousins but stops there. It doesn't extend beyond one generation of ancestors nor does it deal with non-traditional families.It does provide an example of a nice family tree project that a child can create.""Who's Who In My Family?"" by Loreen Leedy gives a child a more well-rounded introduction to the relationships in a family tree."
2,Not what I expected,I thought that this book would be more interactive. Better (and more creative) to draw your own family tree.
1,Can't believe I actualy bought this!!,"I'm always looking for a good ghost story to scare the heck out of myself. After reading some of the reviews I thought maybe I had missed this somewhere along the line and decided to purchase it. Waste of money... This might have been scary a hundred years ago when we didn't have TV or movies with great special effects. This was sooo slow and so boring. When I got to the end I thought ""This is it??"". This wouldn't scare a 5 yr old.."
2,Not worth it,"I don't understand why this is $147. Luckily, I was able to borrow it from the library. This is a very comprehensive DVD about the benefits of breastfeeding, but it only had 10 minutes of actual ""how-to"". I was very disappointed."
3,mix of good and bad,"The good thing about this book is that it gets you thinking and questioning. Like its predecessor, it brings a lot to the table from the ""other side"". You get to read a lot of things you don't see in mainstream publications.The downside is that this book, just like its predecessor, is a mix of good investigative journalism and wacky conspiracy theory. You really have to sort out the wheat from the chaff. There are excellent arguments, and then there are raving left-wing/right-wing lunatics. Some arguments that could have been convincing aren't backed up nearly enough, there is a little too much propagandizing at times, and the few REALLY bad editorials really make the rest of the book look bad. It's a good read, but you really have to do your own research to decide which ones are solid editorials and which ones are uninformed rants."
3,"Not bad, but could do with a new title.","Each essay is well written and most of the time an interesting argument is presented. You cant help but raise an eyebrow at some of the references though (or lack of them).Unfortunately the book assumes that you are American, or at least in touch and in tune with a lot of what goes on over there. There are many political and social references made that I have never heard of.So I think the book should be renamed'Americans: Everything you know is wrong'"
1,Only Works for audio...barely,"I bought this item from another place awhile ago, but I figured I'd warn anyone else who runs into this cable. I've had this cable for quite some time now, I could never figure out how to work the thing until I ran into this[...]I own a ipod classic, and I've never had a problem with other types of cables not working with it except for this one. so I connected all the cables like they were suppose to go, but the only output I got back was audio that kept fading in and out.worthless piece of junk! Don't even bother!"
2,It Shines and reliable but not Bright. For area of 7' x 7' or smaller,It works and motion detects great. Its just not bright enough for me. I will purchase a 18 luminins led light. This is 3.
4,Still going,Overall the batteries dont last to long so get one that can be recharged. The light is enought for a bathroom or to get a drink on the kitchen at night but dont expect to read a book with it something else.
4,one of the better vampire books of the '90's,"""Kiss of the Vampire"" is the title for the American mass market ed. of Nancy Baker's superlative vampire novel ""The Night Inside."" Along with novels like Garfield Reeves-Stevens' ""Bloodshift"" and Scott Ciencin's ""The Vampire Odyssey,"" ""Kiss of the Vampire / The Night Inside"" is a clear forerunner of the ""vampire action"" novels that are currently all the rage. That Nancy Baker is not better known is unfair, and this is one book that should be reprinted. If you like vampire fiction before the genre came to be equated with mainly romance, give this book a shot. Definitely recommended."
5,A sexy lady with human desires and inhuman needs.,I loved it.It's as good as her first and I look forward to the next. I think women write better sex horror books than they are given credit for.
2,Not feel-good,"I'm trying to figure out how to explain that this book was just a little depressing. So...despite a ""happy ending"" (turns out giraffes CAN dance, to their own tune), I really didn't like reading to my little one about the other animals cruelly taunting the giraffe who attempts to dance at the annual ""Jungle Dance."" There are better ways to encourage kids about their abilities (or lack thereof) without throwing in ""you fool."" This story doesn't get much play time in our nursery, and when it does get read, I edit liberally. I gave it two stars for the potential of a cute story, and cute artwork, but ""Giraffes Can't Dance"" is definitely not my favorite."
4,Language,"I really love this book and think it's adorable. My only complaint is language for young ears. Nothing seriously profane, but there's a line that says, ""Giraffes can't dance you silly fool, oh Gerald you're so weird!"" I usually replace fool with goose. It's just not something I want my child repeating so young. Other than that, it's a great book with a cute message!"
4,Cute story,The pictures were very colorful. My son likes dancing so this was a hit. Message was cute about singing to your own music if you don't fit in.
2,More of a toy than a story,"I was disappointed, I wanted a story book. The story is not the same as the real ""Giraffes Can't Dance"". It is a short and boring version. My son does enjoy the magnets but he plays with it we don't read it together like I wanted."
3,Could it be too soon for this lesson? I'm Concerned,"This is a beautifully illustrated book and the rhythm and rhymes are lots of fun to listen to and read aloud. However, I'm a little concerned that the lesson that teasing is cruel may have the unintended consequence of teaching a child to tease by example rather than the desired effect of teaching them not to. My son is not quite 2, and so far teasing has not been an issue we've needed to address. My husband and I have some reservations about this book because we don't want him to learn to tease by example."
4,Good book,"I like the story of this book, but some of the lines are a little off. Like the author just picked out a random word to rhyme with the previous lines. Overall its a hit and is read often."
3,Eclectic Without Depth,"This book is a tremendous tease. It is packed with exciting ideas for chart interpretation that bring you to the boiling point, and then leave you there. I found this frustrating and leaving me to wonder if the whole point of the book wasn't simply to advertise the contributors' private practices.You'll get great ideas and perhaps a springboard or two for further research, but don't look for any in-depth discussion."
2,Digitalis,"I would have to agree with Scott. The book is all dressed up with no place to go. With very few exceptions (mentioned later) none of the articles have any depth or utility. At the most they let you know that a method exists so that you can find out more about it. I will have to say that the article by Shyamasundara Dasa called ""Astamangala Deva Prasna"" was atypical from the others and a fascinating read. Too bad the other articles could not have been as good. He has other very good articles published on his website."
1,I didn't think poison ivy could get worse,I didn't think my case of poison ivy could get worse but it did. After I stopped taking oral ivy things slowly but surely got better. Oral ivy liquid just didn't work for me.
3,can't say for sure,"Someone mentioned this as a homeopathic cure for Poison Ivy to me when my daughter came down with a blistering case as she does almost every year. She didn't seem to get any relief from it, but then again, maybe it wasn't Ivy. We will try this again and change the review if applicable, but for now, the jury is still out."
3,oral ivy,"Service was excellent-question the effectiveness of the product. A second exposure to the poison ivy resulted in a nasty case, that didn't seemed to be helped by the product.2 weeks later-continued use of product WAS effective. Seems you need to use it for close to a month to achive protection, AND keep taking it or the protection will wane!"
4,"pretty good, what there is of it","This package offers pronunciation, grammar, useful phrases, reading exercises, listening exercises, and Korean customs--all in a weak dose.However, it's an enjoyable book because the pages are attractively typeset and illustrated.If you are serious about learning Korean, you need a heftier tome than this one. However, this book is good for review. I would say that it is well worth 5 dollars."
1,boring to the breaking point,this book was so boring.it was confusing since it was in ella's point of view instead of lola's.the whole book is about an election.elections bore me to death.
5,Memory card,I received this quality product in a very short period of time at a very good rate. The product performs splendidly.
4,Nostalgia!,"I've grown up appreciating old time movies, thanks to my mother. I remember seeing this movie pop up from time to time on Disney at late nights. I fell in love with Charles Brandon long after he has been dead and I loved the gallantry and the costumes in the movie. After remembering it a few days ago, I decided to hunt down the movie online and found out Amazon had it for rent. I was thrilled to pieces to see it. I watched it on my iPad and it was great....while it lasted. There was nothing wrong with the movie itself but the streaming it was running under. It kept stopping and was choppy. It didn't diminish my love for the movie. Watch it if you love old movies and the quality they had back then. Hollywood doesn't make movies like this anymore!"
4,The Sword and the Rose,"When I first watched this on television it was called ""When Knighthood was in Flower"". It was a young girl's dream of romance and adventure. It will be fun watching it again."
3,Old Disney Movie,My kids enjoyed this old Disney movie. I thought the acting was a little poor. If you are used to some of the newer movies you may not like this one.
1,Bluezman,"This Air bed is the worst Air bed I have ever had in my life, the mint I took this product out of it's box it had two holes in it and when I patch them more hole on frame appeared in the lining of the Air bed frame, a total of five holes in it.I sold it for $20.00 at a garage sale. Will never buy this product again."
3,Slow Leak,"Developed a slow leak after the second use. Detailed instructions are given on how to find it, but its next to impossible to locate. It was great before the leak. The NON-integrated inflation method is a hassle, but worth it to save some $$$ for a product that gets only occasional use."
4,Excellent Air Mattress,"This is an outstanding air mattress. Very durable, roomy, and comfortable. I love that it is basically 2 air mattresses in 1 and I absolutely LOVE the headboard. No more pillows slipping off in the middle of the night. Very happy with my purchase and highly recommend. Only downside is it takes some time to deflate. If it weren't for that, I would give it 5 stars."
5,All I can say is WOW!,"This is exactly what we needed.... whether you need a camping bed that is very portable or a place for Aunt Jo to sleep on for the weekend...this is it! This is NOT a cheaply made bed... and it is not so light either! But, it is as comfortable as your bed at home (when IT was new)! You will not be disappointed with this one! Shop no farther!!"
4,Good product,"This mattress is by far one of the best I have ever slept on. It sets up fast. The included air pump works great on the outer part, but the attachment for the inner mattress does not stay on well. Bit it woorks. It also deflates very easily with the pump. It is the only mattress I have ever seen that the sheets actually stay on. We used it for a week and did not need to reinflate it at all.I would have given it 5 stars but the included bag is very cheap and ripped the first time we put it away. Otherwise a great buy."
4,Sharptastic retractable highlighter!,"Sharpie's retractable ""accent"" highlighters are great. No smearing of the text or over saturation of ink that bleeds through to other pages and the ink dries almost instantly which is nice.The chisel tip is great and personally I prefer it because it allows me to highlight small text with ease.The addition of a pocket clip is nice. It not only allows you to clip it to your pocket, papers, etc., it prevents the marker from rolling off the desk.I did have to take 1 star off of this set for one reason, price. You can get many other brands of highlighters that work just as well for half this price.No cap to fiddle with just click, mark, click, really can't get any easier than that.Pros:Great vibrant colors!Does not bleed through as badly as other brands of highlighters.Chisel tip allows for precise marking.One handed operation.Cons:Price."
4,Nice assortment of colors,Nice assortment of colors.They don't smear the text you are highlighting over.Clicky (retractable) highlighters are more convenient than capped ones.If you need highlighters these are a good package to buy.
4,Doesn't work very well on my Kindle...,"Okay, just kidding about the Kindle.I use highlighters pretty often at work and at home, and have come to accept that they blur or smudge just about anything but pages in a book. And, many brands promise being smudge-free, but they typically fall short on that claim.Sharpie delivers. Inkjet, cheap-laser, high-cap copy paper, all of them seem to come out clear and intact after taking one of these highlighters to them. If I still had pencils around, I'd give that a try -- that's the sort of confidence I'm getting from these highlighters.Why not five stars then? Some of the colors in this multipack are relatively dark. I don't really care if the highlighter is yellow, blue, green, or pink, but the darker blue and purple markers don't make the underlying text pop the way I'd like them to. For me, at least, I'd be happier if they took out the three darker pens and dropped the price a little.Other than that, this is a pretty good value with excellent results."
3,Preety Good,They got here quick and easy but they are a bit dark and my green one came broken but its useable just the retractable park is like not circle like (0) it was more like straight (-) it just requires a little mor effort and u cant really let ppl use it b/c u have to use ur mouth to actuly use it or u need to have tiny fingers with no nails.
5,Perfect for the inveterate highlighter,"Love, love, love these! As a medical student, I highlight a LOT of material, and being able to use several colors makes linking and/or emphasizing concepts much easier. The clickable function is perfect, as I can have them all out and use whichever one I need as I'm going through my material without having to worry about it drying out. As some folks have mentioned, the purple and dark blue are very dark, and it can be difficult to read text through them. Also, the labling on the markers tends to smear off on your hands the first few times you use them, but wiping down with an alcohol pad is very helpful. In sum, even with the couple minor annoyances, these are by far the best highlighters I've found for school."
2,Aw some,Nice book it is... i love it my uncle is overwhelmed when he received the book in his kindle device
3,Weber's Book Disappoints.,"No one captures the male form better than Bruce Weber. Unfortunately, Bruce's pricy coffe table book has little more to offer than the Abercrombie & Fitch catalog. The small size of the book along with its limited nude photos make it a tepid work of erotic photography at best. Out of an estimated 150 photos only about 6 show the subject nude. Sure the subject is hot and the photographs are beautiful, but you can find similar ones from Weber in periodicals."
3,Pity that it's only almost perfect,"Although this has a phenomenal price for running circles around other players regarding the types of formats it plays (SACD, DVD-Audio/Video, MP3, etc), unfortunately, as someone else pointed out, it gets hung up on DVD-R which it's supposed to play. Top quality DVD-R's get frozen, more so near the middle/end. This problem makes the player a waste of space if you're trying to watch recorded DVD's. The quality on and perfomance on other formats is great so it's a real shame. Kind of like seeing Superman fly by and notice he's split his pants (tights) in the back!"
4,A good book on the Philadelphia mob,"This book covers a bizarre, disjointed and bewildering period in Philadelphia mob history. The Philadelphia mob was, from the death of Angelo Bruno until the mid-to-late-'90s, one of the most violent outfits around, not to mention one of the most tumultuous in terms of power structure. During the period covered by this book, things got REALLY out of hand. If you love stories about crazy mobsters -- like the guy who lit his own hand on fire to give himself an alibi for a murder -- you'll love it. George Anastasia is one of the top-notch organized crime reporters."
4,Great read.,"I enjoyed this book. A lot of names, but there's a section in the back with all the major player and a brief history/reminder of who they are and why they are mentioned in the pages. The secret FBI recordings and their transcriptions are interesting."
5,So funny your stomach will hurt,"This movie is one of the funniest I have ever seen!! I saw it at a film festival in 2009 and since then have wished that my friends could see it, too. It made me laugh so hard I cried and then my stomach hurt, too! I'm so glad it's out on DVD now. Offbeat humor with an underlying positive message. Great soundtrack of original and previously recorded music. This is a must see for anyone who loves movies about music (The Commitments, High Fidelity, Spinal Tap). Fans of the music of Rush or Phil Collins should also see this movie."
5,Excellent Transaction,My order was completed without any problems. All went well. Very good service. Thank you.
1,Clickart review,The images are not beautiful and the software is not easy to use. I am very disapointed in the software and it is too bad that you cannot return the opened product!
5,I LOVE it!,What a great product! One of those things that you can't beleieve how much you needed it--ubtil you have one! I have 3 girls under three and hang to dry alot of their clothes to make them last. This is so compact and handy to use. It also folds up to take up virtually no room at all when out of use
3,Last CD from Gatemouth?,"I enjoyed listening to this CD, but I don't think it's quite up to the standards set by some of his earlier recordings, e.g., ""Gate Swings"", which is one of my favorites. I had the privilege of seeing him a couple of times live in concert, where he was great! I was sorry to hear the other day that he'd passed on, he was a great musician."
2,bad bad lie,"i paid cause i thought this was rare, what i got was a blkack case and a cd, nothing speacial about it...i was totaly ripped off and siapointed. i already have 3 versions of this cd all the same. dont buy from this seller"
1,*Not* as adverstised,"I ordered this DVD when I was already breastfeeding and having a rough time of it. This product did NOT do what was promised. While they show you footage of women breastfeeding in multiple positions, you are only shown the one (cradle) position. The 20 minute video spends more time selling people on the act of breastfeeding than on the mechanics of it - which is what I bought the video for after reading the description and other reviews. Fortunately, by the time I watched the DVD, I was having a better time of things, and could laugh at how NOT HELPFUL it was vs. being further disappointed by the experience."
3,20 minute excerpt!,"I don't know why Amazon only sells this 20 minute excerpt for so much money, when the ""Breastfeeding Comprehensive"" is available elsewhere on the internet, which lasts 130 minutes (one hundred and thirty), and which costs about 50% more. Or you could borrow it from your local library, which I did. The long version actually is comprehensive in its coverage of issues, and is well-done. This 20 minute one seems more aimed at selling the advantages and promoting the practice of breastfeeding:It can't possibly cover all the hows. It's just an introduction."
3,diamond tread toolbox,"The box is great. Problem is that I have a club cab truck and the box doesn't fit because the bottom of the box hits the wheel well and the filler neck inside the bed. I'm having to mount a spacer under the lip in order to use the box. My fault, but make sure that the area under where you are going to mount the box is clear. If not, get a box that mounts between the wheel wells and not up on the lip of the bed."
1,Please do not buy this book,"I found this author not to my taste. the background, her use of language, the plot she weaves, the main characters, are all lacking . I read more than one book, so that I can give her a fair chance. I struggled through the first book, and gave up through the middle of the second. It simply was not worth it, despite the many recommendations she got on the romance talk board , which only shows that one should buy one book and test an author. If you are still in tow minds after reading this please only buy one book."
5,Good hitch,I purchased this hitch for towing my small 5x10 utility trailer behind my tall 2500 Dodge and it works great. It is much lighter than the steel versions and it doesn't rust.
4,childhood classic,i remember reading (and being read to from) this book as a child. the daughter's adventures and misadventures translate into giggling kids and happy parents...to read again and again...
3,Becoming Naomi Leon,"Three stars!! Becoming Naomi leon is a great book. Its a heart-warming story about a girl who finds herself and her family.Pam munoz Ryan did great! the book was awesome although i think she ended it too soon,and should have made it longer; otherwise it was great."
5,"A wonderful, enlightening read!","Becoming Naomi Leon - A wonderful, enlightening read! Naomi and her younger brother Owen live with their great-grandmother. Their mother has abandoned the children; while not interested in parenting, she revisits this family and attempts to reconnect with Naomi in order to facilitate her marriage to a new boyfriend. As the story develops Naomi discovers her father's family in Mexico and the reason for her aptitude as an artist. The reader's experience of the reintroduction of the main character to her cultural background is one of the most rewarding aspects of the book. The story is aptly named as the reader witnesses the evolution of a young girl's grasp on her identity."
1,Confusing mess!,"This started as a promising story. I couldn't put it down in the beginning. It was a real story about a real boy in an exciting, intriguing situation. Then, somewhere in the middle, it just got weirder and odder and more confusing. And the stranger it got, the less interested I felt. It was difficult to visualize a world where every single thing (everything!) is unfamiliar. People don't look like people. Buildings don't look like buildings. It was hard to care about the side characters, because they were so bizarre. I love fantasy and science fiction, but this storyteller forgot something very important. The reader needs something familiar to help them relate to the story and characters. I definitely won't read the rest of this series. Blah! Way too strange and confusing!"
5,Overlooked but great!,I came upon this book while browsing my local Barnes and Nobles. I was hesitant to purchase it thinking just what the world needs is another take off of Harry Potter. After reading several pages I relented and purchased Mister Monday. I could not put the book down. Garth Nix does an excellant job of intertwining the real world with that of the big house. His characters are believable and descriptions vivid. I found myself staying up late to finish so that I could pass it on to my students. They have enjoyed it too. I just purchased the second book (Tuesday) and I see that Wednesday (the third)is out in hardback. This is a great series of books! One that I highly recommend.
5,One of My All-Time Favorite Books,I first started this series a year ago while traveling to New Jersey. This book was so good it took me 5 hours to read it. I still had 6 hours before we made it to New Jersey. The whole series is very fasinating and creative. This can be confusing sometimes but it brings you right back. My only disappointment is that I have to wait a year for Superior Saturday
5,Mister Monday: one of the best books on the shelf.,"Mister Monday is the kind of book that pulls you in after the first page and pulls you to the end. It is a very mysterious book, with more beginnings then ends. Arthur is suspended between many betrayals, and has many things like ""Trust the Will"" and then ""Don't trust the Will"" told to him, and is constantly hunted by the lazy mister monday and his Noon (Right hand man), Dawn (Left hand woman) and constantly helped by Mondays Dusk, the final of the trio of the day (You may have guessed Mister Monday can only come to earth on monday, his dawn can only come from 12:01 AM-1:00 AM, Noon can only come from 12:00 PM-1:00 PM, and finaly dusk can come from 11:00 PM-12:00 AM).With only the lesser part of the first key to aid him, Arthur is always fighting against the odds. Not only does he have to defeat Mister Monday but the other Morrow days as well.A great beginning of a series, The Keys to the Kingdom is definatly going to be a wonderfull tale indeed."
4,Garth Nix scores again,"Mister Monday tells the story of young Arthur Penhaligon's attempt to save the world, or at least his community and family, from a deadly virus. It certainly sounds simple enough, but this novel is anything but simple. Once again Nix takes the reader to unimaginable places where danger is always at hand and the rules aren't what they seem.THis series isn't as good as the Abhorson series, but then it is aimed at a younger audience. Even so, this series is well worth reading. The characters are likeable, the plot is complicated yet compelling and the writing superb. This fantasy will certainly hit the mark for anyone who enjoys the genre."
2,Careful with this one,"Biographers explain that Klemperer, who suffered from bi-polar disorder most of his adult life, wrote frantically during manic episodes, and then often destroyed his compositions during periods of depression. It is easy to interpret mania in the pages of the works on this CD - particularly in the Symphony No 1, which is almost comical in many of its melodic and structural elements. Unfortunately, it makes for some uncomfortable listening. The Symphony No 2 is more uniform, but also not very distinuished. The performances here are top-notch and well recorded - but can't make up for the subject matter. Careful when purchasing, unless you know what you are getting into.In an almost disturbingly parallel way, the liner notes (in translation) also appear to be written by someone not quite certain where their thoughts were going. Don't count on getting any reliable information about Klemperer or the pieces on the recording from these liner notes."
3,more enjoyable than the actual movie,"I read this book a while ago and just reread it the other day. I really liked it. As an UBER Star trek fan, it was really refreshing to see things from another point of view other than Shatner's.I HATED Star Trek The Motion Picture. The worst in the series next to that awful, Shatner-directed Final Frontier. I found this book more enjoyable than the actual movie.I don't know if Koenig used a ghost writer or not, but whoever wrote it did a really good job. It's a good and fun read."
2,Big and Not Accurate,"I owned this watch for 2 weeks and here are what I found:Pros:1) Its a Beautiful watch and the material used seems to be of high quality.2) Its automatic, so no trips to the watch repair shop every 2 years for replacement battery which ruins the H2O resistant seal.3) Wrist Band, nice shine and clasp-less.Cons:1) Mine did NOT keep accurate time, hence I returned it.2) Thickness, this is a very thick watch and so its also heavy.Also, the actual watch is darker than it is represented on My Dell flat screen monitor. Its more ""mocha"" like.I hope this helps. Perhaps mine was just a Lemon, but I returned it after the time was constantly off. I was almost late to one of my appointments because of it."
2,I don't know what to think............,"but I'll just add this:This is an odd little movie.I haven't seen any otherdepiction of the Manson FamilySaga that allows the viewerto witness not just the mad events,but also the mad logic of Manson.It's like viewing an extended acidtrip from inside the headof a hyper-rhetorical fool.We all know the story, but this movieaffords us a (safely distant) opportunityto see how they sawthe world. There are tons of creepyimages and satanic-inspired interludesto keep you glad that you weren'ta part of the madness (or hopefullymost of us were not).I don't really recommend this movieunless someone just wanted to seethe Manson family story from anotherangle."
1,a waste of film and time!,"this flick is str8 garbage! i went buy the reviews that peeps giv on here.and i can say different strokes 4 different folks.u can't go by wut peeps say cause everybody has their own oppinion feel me? this is the 3rd manson flick i bought and all of em suck! lol! i hav the 1 that was on tv and it has gotten old up 2 adays standards.so if anybody kno a close 2 the truth 1 with xplixcit content,holla at ur boy!"
1,UTTER GARBAGE,"Not much to say, hardly anything like the real story, if you want to delve into a more frightning charles manson story, read Vincent Bugliosi's book ""Helter Skelter"" that's TRUE terror."
1,Don't waste your time,"If I could rate this movie minus 10 I would. There is nothing new here and as a matter of fact, the dialog is taken mostly from other movies (Hendrickson's ""Manson"")and repeated here in clips. ""Manson"", by the way, is a much better film if you want to learn about the Family from the actual participants. Charles Manson Superstar is another good one if you are after a learning experience. Both films above are disturbing and creepy in the sense that it is real.If you are just interested in sex, violence and blood then you will probably like Van Bebber's film because that's what it consists of. Nothing more, nothing less......"
3,good for beginners,"There is a good book for beginners. Few things to note there are errors cropping up in his later chapters like the windows service installer excercises and asynchronous callback example, the update in edit data in datagrid. The last three chapters were very clumpsily put together in which someone with 7 years of exp cannot put together why they were even there when the explanation and example were of poor quality. Don't get me wrong, this is a very good dummies book, however after finishing the blueprint examples, a vb.net beginner wrox book would be the next book one should go for to fill in the gaps"
1,"No CD, No software, and no explaination or description of the word.","There is no software or CD coming with the dictionary, what a disappointment. I will return it right way."
1,Hate it!,"This is not a user friendly program. It does not allow you to do basic functions like change margins or select custom card size. Even when you buy the Avery cards, the layout doesn't necessarily match the size of the actual card, and there is now way to change it.This was complete waste of money!"
4,It works for what it is.,"I got this controller specifically for the d-pad, but I find myself perplexed by the d-pad itself. The d-pad on this controller is alot harder to use than the regular controller. I would just use this controller as a means of playing roms/emulator games and just sticking with the regular controller. You'll notice the difference and end up preferring to go back to the original controller."
2,i Dont recommend this controller to anybody,"i bought this controller to replace my controller that is held together with black duct tape and my busted controller is better than this one! my busted controller works better than this one by far this one makes you look up at the sky and and that ground when playing a FPS like those that i play, after trying to play Halo with it for a few minutes i unplugged it and plugged in my busted controller hell atleast it stays steady instead of the sight floating about, i couldnt believe that my original microsoft 360 controller held with duct tape actually works better than this one! if you are thinking about buying this DONT! ITS NOT WORTH THE MONEY IN WAY!"
1,"2 controllers, 1 was broken right out of the box, other 1 worked for less than 2 month","I bought this product from Fry's Electronics because it was the cheapest controller there. The first controller I bought, the A button was getting stuck when I apply a moderate amount of pressure. So I returned it and got another Madkatz controller. The new one worked fine for about a month and a half and then the right analog stick started panning to the left by itself. Funny I looked at other reviews and another user had the same problem.I submitted a ticket online, and it's been 5 month and still did not get a reply. I called their tech support and they are always offline.It's funny I recently just found out that Saitek belong to Madkatz because my first PC game controller was made by Saitek and that thing broke after 2 weeks. If I would have known that Madkatz owned Saitek I would have never bought the 360 controllers."
1,Does not have an invert switch,"I don't know why they continue to advertise this feature, as it hasn't been on these controllers for a couple of years. So anyone trying to get a fix for Silent Hill Homecoming better keep looking."
1,Terrible controller,"I brought this controller to play platform and other types of games on my pc, I didn't really use it for shooters. After barely a month I noticed the right stick would turn to the left on it's own. I actually had to hit it with my hand to get it to stop. Yeah, stupid idea but that fact that the problem presented itself without any damage before I hit it makes this a terrible choice for a controller. A month later the problem came back but now it's even worse. I would not advise anyone to buy this. I've used madcat controllers for my regular xbox before and encountered problems, thought they would of actually improved when coming to the 360. They have not."
3,Cheap!,"It does its job for the price, but it is not as good as other controllers that are more expensive."
1,Poor quality Singer sewing machine made in China,"I purchased this sewing machine with high hopes and put my trust in the Singer brand name.But found instead that this is a poorly made machine that couldn't even perform at the lowest level.The metal feet that are supposed to advance the fabric don't move the cloth forward at all, but instead just go up and down, which doesn't help at all. The large dial that is suppose to change the length of the stitch didn't make any difference whatsoever. Even a simple straight stitch was a mess.Avoid this machine."
3,Maturing Poet,"His poems in written In Spanish are simple and touching. Even though this young Dominican poet exhibits potential in this book he still doesn't show real talent. The book is divided in three time periods which make it easier to see the progress his making. He hasn't found his voice yet, he still doesn't have a definite style which mean he still hasn't matured. He need to gain domination of the Spanish languege and better use of metaphors to beautify his poetry. There is no doubt he is still only developing and that he has a long way to go."
3,Not a new recording,"Despite the title, this is not a new live recording by Al Stewart. It is a compilation of both live and studio acoustic tracks from throughout his career, from 1970's ""Zero She Flies"" through ""Between The Wars."" ""Intro/Year Of The Cat"" is from a promotional-only radio station album, so it may be rare to US fans, though it was on the UK reissue of ""Russians & Americans."""
5,AMAZING!,"This band is amazing, it's almost mind-boggling how this band is not making a big hit on the music scene. I saw them live and they sound as good live as they do on the CD. They put on a great show, we hung out with them after the show cause me and my friends were one of the few there for the signing. They are a great bunch of guys who are making awesome music. I support them 100% and everyone reading this should give Framing Hanley a chance because they will not dissappoint anyone who likes rock music."
2,Eh....,"I bought the CD because I liked the cover of Lollipop they did. Lollipop is a great song, but the rest of this album is rather bland and the sound it very repetitive. As if it's catered to teen girls."
4,"Spitfires, Thunderbolts, and Warm Beer","The book details the behind the scenes life of a fighter pilot. Not always glamorous shooting down the enemy, but what it was like during those years of WWII.Not a thriller, but, interesting to someone interested in one individuals experience. Especially one who was such an excellent fighter pilot"
4,GReat REview,"If You Take a Mouse to the Movies, then what happens? Your child will have fun finding how one thing leads to another. This book provides endless entertainment for all.Reasoning: The first reason that someone should buy this book is it shows how to care and be responsible for pets. More then 50% of American families own pets but not many of them know how to treat them so many of them end up dieing. The next reason some one should buy this book is that cheery attitude of this book can help kids out with their problems and make them feel better. The next reason is that the many people can get good advice from this book and the pictures are easy to understand making this book fun for kid's worldwide.This book's unexpected sequences of this book are loveable. The responsibility it takes to raise a pet is accurate. The cheerful pictures and vocabulary building is excellent for your child to excel socially and academically. This book is a must have!"
5,If You Take a Mouse To the Movies by Laura Numeroff,I have purchased the full set of Laura Numeroff books for all 4 of my children. They were the favorite books of my son who passed away at the age of 10 due to brain cancer a few years ago. I am now purchasing the books for my grandson due in December. I have pre-ordered her new books. These are the greatest books!!! Every child (family) should own them!!!!!Pam Roundy
5,Funny!,"Laughed myself silly the first time I read this in the children's section of a large bookstore. Had to buy it for my great neice! She is 3-4 and loves it, too! Wants more!"
3,fish like 'em,My fish like these but I have a problem with the size of the worms. Basically only about 1/10 of the package contains usable good sized worms the rest is just very tiny worms an powder. This powder is no good for the water. Anyway the fish love them but you don't get much use out a package.
3,Pretty but heavy,This medallion is very pretty but the description states it is light weight which it is actually much heavier than the other ceiling medallions I have purchased. I put it on my digital scale and it weighs 6.2 lbs. The underside of the medallion is not flat but grooved all throughout the pattern which makes gluing this much more difficult. Due to these two factors it is much more of a task to install than the lighter flat backed medallions. Keep this in mind when making your selection.
5,"Captivating, thoroughly researched--finished it in two days","The author weaves together many esoteric topics (ranging from political scandal to ecology to railroad development to grain prices) in a compelling and enjoyable way. This book has given me a much deeper understanding of the development of Chicago, the West, and the country as a whole. It's also an excellent explanation of the development of the American economy (and the world economy). Thoroughly researched and elegantly written, it is just as enjoyable as any fiction book. I finished it in two days.-Ian Holzhauer"
3,Two very good songs on this album,"""Greatest Secret"" is a perfect song. The opening track is also a great song. Everything else isn't all that memorable.If you can just get mp3 files, buy ""Greatest Secret"" as it is as good as any song out there. It reminds me a bit of ""Pooka"" or a girl band equivalent of ""Badly Drawn Boy."""
4,"Oh, The Places You'll Go",I think this book is a very good book for children to read. Dr. Suess makes reading very fun and easy by using words that rhyme together. It uses places of fiction to expand a childs mind and get him/her thinking of where they can go in the future.
1,"Love, Family Absent from Book","I cringe every time my son (4yrs old) has me read him this book. I hate it. The basic premise -- if you don't like where you are, get up and leave it all behind for great adventure, and when that doesn't work out, you'll have to figure it all out for yourself and then you'll be back at it, unless that doesn't work out... etc. The premise is not only flawed, it runs counter to everything I'd like him to learn: that he is surrounded by love and the support of his family and friends, and that when the going gets tough he shouldn't just leave town; he should learn to value trusted relationships to help him overcome challenges. The book has no sense of family, love, or other type of support, and while it does say ""kid, you'll move mountains"" it forgets to say ""kid, you're well-grounded and loved"" and that is a fatal error by Seuss. Also, the language (complex - ""dexterous and deft"") is not suitable for young readers."
5,Start this project VERY early...like pre-school!,"This will be a gift to each of my boys upon graduation...haven't decided high school or college. Anyway, I started in pre-school, at the end of each year I write a little something about that child and how I saw him grow and develop. The book will not be ""revealed"" until the graduation I choose (again, still haven't decided how to go on that one). I will give this as a keepsake gift. I have one for each child. The story is the same no matter which edition, but the slipcover makes it extra special."
5,"Oh, The Places you'll Go","Oh, The Places You'll Go! Classic Seuss made a wonderful gift for the graduate - even the very intellectuals - it brought back a memory of their childhood while delivering a serious message."
4,Great graduation gift,"This is my ""staple"" high school graduation gift. It's a great gift for the graduate with or without money tucked inside. It talks about life, both the good and the bad, but ends with a positive message. The kids I've given it to have all seemed to love it...especially at 18, sometimes you just want to sit down with Dr. Suess and be a kid again. It does get a little slow at certain parts, but in general I'd say it's a good book with a great message."
5,Funny and uplifting!,"I was an adult when i read it, yet i enjoyed it very much! Books for adults are seldom covered with colorful pictures and almost never rhyme. It is a great gift for someone at the crossroads of life, when they feel scared for new beginnings. Life is a journey, and oh! the places we will go!"
5,Motivational masterpiece,Classic Seuss tells the tale of life's journey and the responsibilty we all face to go forward and accomplish are goals.
5,Wonderful encouraging and gently bracing stuff,"I find this little book quite poignant because Dr. Seuss has managed to squeeze the hard won wisdom of adulthood into an innocuous text and without being cynical or disingenuous, tells the young reader that life will be both sweet and sour. It is at heart, though, an exhortation to go out and find the world and be all that you can be. I think this is a wonderful message in a time when there is much concern and fear for the wellbeing of our children which could result in diminished opportunities and fewer adventures as we attempt to shield them. The book is well made and comes in a protective sleeve. Its quality and the removing of the sleeve impressed my daughter and gave our bedtime read a ceremonial flair."
5,"Oh, the Places You'll Go","This note is for cool grandparents in particular: This is the ultimate graduation gift, and an essential for your home library."
5,Great for graduates of any age,"Wonderful book for anyone at any age, especially at graduation. Thanks!"
5,In Plain Sight,"This book is a great read. I discovered C.J. Box novels and couldn't get enough. I didn't read them in order so I purchased the entire series and reread them in order and loved them the second time around even more. The characters are very real and engaging. The main character, Joe Pickett is an interesting person and the reader feels like the know him."
5,C.J. Box,This author is great.Makes me want to visit Wyoming.His characters are so real.The description of the surrounding countryside takes you there.What a breath of fresh air.
5,Nice little tent,"I love this little tent, it's perfect for one person plus gear but can hold two in a pinch. I waterproofed all the seams when I unpacked it and set it up for a couple of days.Easy setup and sturdy. make sure you buy some heavier duty tent stakes and don't forget a ground cover to protect the bottom. Great value for the money."
4,works fine for me,"I've had a CS100 for almost 3-1/2 years now and has worked flawlessly since day one. I had to replace teh batteries of the chest strap just once during this period, everything else is still original. Now after almost 3-1/2 yrs it seems the speed sensor has gone out of service. I am taking away one start because the battery on the speed sensor can not be replaced by the consumer, which seems trivial in this day an age. It takes a bit of effort to initially set it up, but once you know how it works pressing the 2-4 buttons at the end of each ride to get the stats is no problem. The buttons are a little stiff though and if you are riding in winter with padded gloves you have to take them off to press any buttons."
2,Flawed,"This is my second Polar.I have a cheap entry level model on my mountain bike, which works flawleslly.This model is'nt good.- The buttons are extra stiff, and with full gloves are really hard to operate during cycling.- The first batery had to be replaced after a week, although fully charged, otherwise the unit did'nt work!... so I had to waste time on that.- the thing takes ages to give a good and stable heart reading.- it looses reading when it feels like it, in mid practice, whenever.- non of this happens with their cheapo model I have.- to sum up - junk.- oh, and it has a very anoying beep, confirming everything it does."
2,Don't waste your money on this!,"I am tired of Polar. Their stuff just doesn't work well at all. First I tried their F6 heart rate monitor watch, and it constantly said my heart rate was in the 200's during moderate workouts. Then I got a deal on this computer and thought I would give it a try. Well unless you can get the magnet right next to the Huge Polar fork mounted sensor, you will not get a reading. I have to have my magnet and the sensor both angled inward so they're about 1/8"" apart. That's ridiculous. Not only is it not aerodynamic, it looks stupid. In addition, you better have your handlebars very low and close to the fork sensor, or you wont get any readings. Why build a wireless sensing system that doesn't work. Well, don't buy this one. I learned my lesson!"
2,Disappointed,"I am one of those who likes to see all the little facts and figures to show progress of my workouts. I purchased a POLAR product because I have had good luck with this brand in the past. However, this model (CS100) is one I cannot recommend. If you chuck down $100+ for a bike computer, you would expect it to work properly. I doubled and triple checked the installation (very straight forward) and everything is correct. I think the engineers need to go back to the drawing board.Pluses:* Very Easy Installation* Fairly solid construction & design* Instruction manual is well writtenMinus:* Looses speed signal often* Rarely registers any speed below 8 mph.* Online Customer Support/Warranty support not great."
4,Didn't think I would like it...,"but I loved it! Me? A straight, married, never gave a second thought to the transgendered community? Yep. Midwives was unavailable at the library so I picked up his new one and was pleasantly surprised. All of the main characters are well developed, and the NPR sub plot was wonderful. A good read for the thoughtful straight but not narrow community. (And any other community for that matter!)"
2,Pinch me I'm snoring.,"No, I don't have ADD and yes, I felt this novel moved at reptilian speed. And frankly, the prose isn't lyrical enough to warrant such a pace. Don't get me wrong, it's not clumsy. It's very clean. But it's certainly not a ""beautifully written"" novel. But it thinks it is. Furthermore, I couldn't really tell any difference between the narrators. He has the same voice as she and they have the same voice as her. You get the idea. I hate to say it, but I've read instructions on the backs of seed packets that had more passion. Now, with a topic like this, one would expect one's fingers to be glued to the page, turning and turning, madly. Sadly, this was not the case with Mink's fingers. Mink's fingers tapped. Though Mr. Bohjalian does get an extra star for trying. Even if he tried a little too hard."
2,Disappointing and Frustrating,"What started as an interesting novel, became one that dragged on and then became ridiculous by the end. In a complicated situation, the characters all were very flat and unbelievable. The premise of the novel was very different and had great potential, but could have been handled in a more intelligently matter. I finished the book just to finish it!"
3,Twisted Ending,"As my title says, this is a twisted ending, not just a twist. I guess I should have seen it coming from all the strange foreshadowing, but it really left me slightly unsatisfied and a little confused. Where did it come from, and why? It seemed like the ending happened too quickly and was thrown in just for kicks, kind of like an M. Night Shyamalan movie.I have now read 3 books by this author, and I have enjoyed all of them, although I have to say that Midwives was much better than this one. I did enjoy Trans-Sister Radio, but found Dana annoying, pompous and off-putting. Will was hard to understand. The characters in this book didn't seem to have as much depth as other characters created by this author, but I liked the amount of research that obviously went into this story. The details about actual sex-change operations were pretty interesting.Overall, it's okay, but not Bohjalian's best. Try Midwives if you are looking for something with incredible depth that you can't put down."
3,Well rounded characters,"I thought this was a good read for many reasons: 1) I was reading a novel yet learning a lot about a subject area (trans-gender reassignment) that I didn't know a lot about; 2) the way that the author has chosen to write the novel enables him to tell a lengthy story, explain quite a bit about the subject and then deeply explore all the characters from where they are feeling or coming from. I especially liked this as often if the story is from only one point of view, the other characters aren't explored deeply from where they come from. I really admire the author for being able to delve into each character and explain this subject in a layperson's terms and still make it an entertaining read. If you like to be fascinated by unknown subjects, this is a good novel to pick up."
3,A risky book to write,"With all the topics to write about Mr. Bohjalian decided to take a huge risk and write about transgenders. An interesting and brave choice especially after being selected by Oprah for his book Midwives. The story is compelling and actually makes you flinch at times when he describes the surgery. I enjoyed the book and have to applaud him for writing it, even though it may not please everyone. I'm sure the author will be applauded or crucified for taking transgenders into the mainstream."
4,Fascinating,"I found this book well written, interesting, with well thought out characters. It brought up a lot of issues dealing with who and how we love, what gender means, and the changes that people are capable of. I thought it was thoroughly enjoyable, but I really was disappointed with the ending,also. While Chris Bohjalian tried to show the complexities of love and gender and sexual identity, why did he have to have everyone remaining straight in the end?"
3,Neon Wonder,"Got to say that if one man can make a movie worth watching then there's only one man, MICHAEL IRONSIDE."
5,Nepotism? Heck no.,"I ordered this book a while back. Unfortunately, I had a huge pile of books to read before I got to it.Much of Wendy's writing, like her life, is raw.It's truly amazing to read what someone you lived with for the first 13 years of your life has written. Subtle references, borrowed images and an almost tangible feeling of underlying dread--these are the things I experienced when reading this book.Life isn't like a romance novel--and in our case, it is quite the antithesis. Life is unkind and hard and just below the surface, it makes you raw.I guess it doesn't matter if that was her intention or if that is anyone else's interpretation. It's what I felt. And it's a rare book that makes me really ""feel"".Good job, sis.-Kevin Henline"
1,Pimsleur Chinese Mandarin Quick and Simple,"This method would be perfect if it had a text book attached to it. Babies can learn without reading, but as soon as they master the sounds of communication they need to learn how to read and write to improve their skills. I find incredible that Pimsleur refuses to give access to a text book as soon as the learner has mastered basic sounds. I am a University Professor and can testify that a language method without a text book is a fake"
4,Not a boy but a Man.....,"This story is told from inside of 15-year-old Luther T. Farrell's head, he is our narrator. We get to listen in as he struggles to figure out his feelings and actions. Luther is a philosopher and he has a philosophical way of looking at almost everything. Some of the things he thinks are downright funny.His friend Sparky is always thinking of ways to make money. These ideas put Luther in some humorous situations and in one almost serious trouble.Sparky thinks Luther has it made because Luther has a job and his mother is a big time landlord who makes lots of money. But Luther is slowly facing the truth about his mother and her business.The humor in this story almost conceals its difficult coming-of-age situation. The more Luther's story unfolds, all its ugly realities begin to show themselves and forces our hero to see things as they really are not as he hoped they would be.This is a funny story but a not so funny Sarge!"
4,Great basic grooming book,"Great basic grooming book despite being an older edition. Enough detail to guide anyone through the steps toward a good looking, well cared for dog. Grooming issues haven't changed over the years."
1,Dog Grooming,I found the book to be far too general and no Bichon Frise's were in there. It really hasn't been too useful to me.
4,I was a little disappointed,"The book covers what you will need, and the steps for grooming are clear. But some instructions like ""scissor the tail into a full, round pom-pom"" are OK, but I need directions for HOW to make a pom-pom on my poodle's tail. And it's great to know that my pekingese needs to have his tummy shaved, but HOW do I get him to stand on his hind legs to let me do it? And how do I cut the hairs at the tip of my pomeranian's ears when she keeps trying to bite the scissor? I'm not sure this is a ""beginner's"" book. It would be a great quick reference book for someone who has a grooming shop and needs to look up the clipping pattern for a schnauzer or a cocker spaniel as a refresher before she starts clipping the dog. I'll have to keep looking for a book that is even more basic."
3,This book has strong atmosphere and unclear motivation.,"Morris is excellent with atmosphere and mood, and my chest felt tight with anxiety. But I found Maggie, unclear and unbelievable. Why, for example, does she go whenever and wherever Isabel wants, do whatever she asks, even when she is not interested and in spite of work deadlines? Why did she return to the island where obviously she would be in danger after helping Isabel escape"
4,Treatise!,"This book on orchestration is top notch. Not only does it cover the basics, but it goes further by accepting that some ""rules"" can be broken to get the desired effect the orchestrator is looking for. I would recommend it to beginners as well as advanced students who want to learn to go beyond the borders."
3,Not for smaller bare root trees,"First of all this bag is Huge! If your trees are fairly small with small tree trunks, this is too heavy of an item to use, as it tilts the tree from the weight of the bag when filled with water, and covers the lower branches of the tree. Wish I had ordered the tree ring style!"
5,Best leadership book in years!,This is a fabulous book that examines all the theories of leadership over the past 100 years and identifies those valid aspects of leadership that truly work. Extensive research is intermingled with interesting stories to present leadership traits and behaviors that generate organizational success. This is the best management book of the 21st century!
3,Business Leadership Class Requirement,"This book was a great resource if you want a text that details the types of leaders, qualities and leadership models. I would not have purchased this book if were not a required textbook. However, there is a wealth of information with just about everything you need to know about business leadership. It's a good read but not an easy one."
5,Robespierre the Villain!,"Many view the French Revolution and Enlightenment to be great events in the annals of history. However Mr. Scott clearly refutes this idea through eye-witness accounts and noted historical accounts. The work is the result of a great mind and great labours. His bibliography is extensive and I have purchased many of the listed items to find that they are indeed in accord with Mr. Scott's writings. The truth of the matter is that the French Revolution was not a great step for mankind, but it was a step back to butchery, bigotry, and anarchy. No true member of manking (God's creation) would think otherwise. Though some may delude themselves into beleiving this time in history to be closest to a Humanistic Heaven."
1,Poor scholarship,"Mr. Scott betrays his lack of familiarity with the era, and instead rants for most of this book, which should be avoided by any serious readers"
5,Fresh and aromatic,"Herbs from this company seem to be fresh, aromatic and of high quality. I ordered several varieties that are impossible to find in our local markets, and have been very pleased with the quality of the products."
4,over priced,"Nice selection of songs from America's greaest band, but its just another hits cd. This is only for the fanatic's like me."
3,Re-Think Your Actions.,"I enjoyed the story, it was full of odds'n'ends that made a great plot. The fact that this story is about two High School boys who eventually become lovers, I'll admit it gave me the creeps, but it was a good story none the less. I am terribly disappointed with the Main Character's personality. It was like he had no reason to be happy for himself or even to guard himself against getting bullied. Out of all the people I know, none of them would have taken that kind of abuse from another student, Senior or not. I don't know if that was that particular country's way of thinking or a major character flaw. All in all, this Manga is okay. I like it enough to keep it, it wasn't too bad. The Artwork is this book is awsome ! There is no nude scenes in this book, so you don't have to be frightened. Research for information about this Manga before you buy it, you may regret it."
4,"Good, but not what I was expecting","I just wanted to throw a slight disclaimer out there; even though the OtRFK novels are Yaoi, the manga is NOT EXPLICIT! It leans on the shounen-ai side of the main characters' relationship. But it's a pretty cute story, and I enjoyed it."
1,Not as good as it looks,"I bought this watch for my Husband on Valentines Day. Very nice looking watch if you don't mind the time always being off. I read all of the time setting warnings and still the watch would not keep time for more then a day. Very poor quality when it comes to how it runs. If your one of those people who don't care about the time and want a bracelet that looks like a watch, this is the one for you. Would not buy this brand ever again. I feel horrible that this beautiful watch that I got for a great deal runs like something out of a cracker jack box. At least he would have had a snack with that."
4,beautiful timepiece,this is my 5th invicta. Very nice. I would have liked a heavier band but it looks great.
4,both good and bad,"the watch arrived about a week ago. i took it to the jeweler to have it sized. done. right away i noticed that it was losing time. i went back and read the instructions which were generic for several watches and not real clear. i called the customer service and spoke to a lady who was very helpful. she said that it was probably the battery and she would send me a replacement watch which she did at no cost to me whatsoever as long as i returned the original before the specified time. i returned i yesterday. in the interim sinced i had alrealy had the first watch sized, i chcck whther it was keeping time and it was so i kept it. it's still funcitoning correctly and i did place a black leather strrap on it and it looks great."
2,Read if you are interested in his personal life and not tennis,It's much more about his personal life and business pursuits than tennis. The extent to which he has burned out on the game really comes through in the lack of interest he seems to have in writing about it. Few matches get any more than a sentence or two. Pretty disappointing.
5,Negura Bunget - N Crugu Bradului,"I received this album a week ago, amongst a lot of other CDs, but am just listening to it now. Why? Cos the other CDs sounded more appealing to listen to (at the time). Wow... how wrong I was! This is GREAT!. Not knowing what to expect - I was delighted when I heard spooky sounds (this album really deserves headphones), atmosphere synth, and later into BLACKMETAL... I just thought I'd write this for now, hopefully get you wanting to know more. I'll continue listening to ""N Crugu Bradului"" in the next day or so.. I hadnt heard of this band before but it looks as though they are from Romania, have been around a while, and have another 3 albums (no doubt well worth checking out also..)."
2,What the Hell?,"When I first listened to ""Now and Again,"" I thought it was one of the best albums I've heard in a long time. Each song was worth listening to with a great hook. The band also have a great sound. So, I was excited to get ""Treehouse,"" expecting at least some of the greatness of ""now and Again."" I was disappointed. Gone are the hooks, the sound, or anything like ""Now and Again."" There a few good songs but overall it was just disappointing. If you want to get an album by Grapes of Wrath, pick up ""Now and Again"" not ""Treehouse."""
2,Not Satified,I was not satified as I did not know there was not AC port on the unit.Also I has a radio which I did not want.
2,Did I Read The Same Book?,"I haven't read any of the other Springwater books, so I came to this book cold. To me, it seemed to be just a pastiche of plots that were done better by other authors. I could just see the author going through her inventory of idea index cards and choosing them at random: big-city woman returning to her roots to start a small b&b, injured big-city cop/hunk/town-bad-boy returning to his roots to heal after his partner was killed, the failing old homestead, cattle rustling, the too-soon pregnant young married couple, the fighting old-marrieds (with the maternal character totally lifted from an old Maureen O'Hara-John Wayne movie), etc, etc, etc. Bah! I expected much more from Ms. Miller. I never even wound up finishing the book, and it takes an awful lot for me not to do that."
2,Outdated,"This product is totally outdated. Besides, I was unable to run it on a windows vista operatng system."
5,"Not a review, but a suggestion...","Having enjoyed ""Swordspoint"" immensely, I was delighted to find a sequel, of sorts, in the latest ""Year's Best Fantasy and Horror"" collection. Called ""The Death of the Duke,"" it is a novella-epilogue to the story of Alec and Richard St. Vier, as well-written as its predecessor if tantalizingly brief. For all who read and enjoyed ""Swordspoint,"" I offer a sincere recommendation. (I have not yet read ""The Fall of Kings,"" a novella also set in the world of Riverside and the City. That's next on the list.) A bonus: The author's-note preface to this story mentions that there is a sequel in the works. Bring it on! We've been waiting long enough."
3,"Rousing good story, but...","I should have read the other customer reviews a little closer. What they said about the story and the writing are spot-on! However, as a Christian I was uncomfortable reading about a gay relationship. Even though I also bought ""The Fall of Kings"" I didn't read it. Both books went into my give-away box."
1,defected product,"Strangly enough, these pluggers are made of such a hard inflexible rubber material that they simply don't work."
4,"HANDLE NEEDED LOCKING DEVICE ,OR LOCTITE",The merchant I had no problems with.The plunger and holder are of good quality. .It looks good in bathroom. My only complaint is the handle screws off with use. I used screw loctite to keep it from screwing off.
3,Remarkable Survival Story,"A remarkable true story of a woman's survival in the frozen arctic. It focuses your attention and interest throughout the first 2/3 of the book. However, it does bog down a bit with too much boring detail about her life afterwards."
5,Underused technique---Golden,"The Late Rick Houck was a rarity; a man who put his Money where his Astrological mouth was, backing many of his predictions with a ""money back guarentee"" so to speak. his predictions were quite accurate, thus he had few takers...This book on Ashtakvarga, a Hindu transit technique was a major tool in ricks work. I have used it and it is one of the few techniques in astrology, Eastern or western that pay off quite well. enough said.Thank you Richard, for writing this book."
2,james last remembers the sixties,I am a big fan of James Last and consider him my favorite but James Last Remembers The Sixties was a big disapointment as none of the songs matched the titles.The music is good but I would not of bought this album for what I got.I bought it to hear what was advertised. i
5,Great fun for the whole family,"I purchased this item as a birthday gift for my son, and he said it was a great addition to his new game room."
3,Beware!,"Vacuum works great, but finding bags for it is a total pain in the rear. Shop-Vac does not even carry them on their site!"
4,Power to Spare,"This little vac does what larger ones can do. It doesn't hold as much debris and shouldn't be a dedicated tool for a busy shop. It's a great home vac, though."
1,As Good as it Gets!!,"I have all the Carpenters music and yet I go back time and time again to this wonderful album. Listening to the early recordings and then to this one is a sure indication of the beauty that maturity and time were building into this incredible voice. Yes, this album was played over much after her death. But after all these years it still contains a wonderful depth and richness that living gives us all. Karen allowed that to show in her music. Get this one . . . you'll never regret it!!"
4,Great book for Aggies and those who love Aggies,"This book is full of great information about the University and the Corps. Best compilation of data I have seen and written in a captivating manner. Several humorous stories help to bring the history to life. Amazing how more things changed over the years, the more they actually stayed the same."
1,IT is not good,This comforter is not that much good.No one falldown seeing online pics because we had experience about this comportter.After coming my comforter to my home we felt vey bad and we saw what is the quality of the comforter.IT's very bad comforter.
1,not satisfied,I ordered this one for 19.99.It is not good.looking old.some tears on border.I thought to return it.But they were calculating shipping charges.Thats why I did not return it.For first wash it seif it was teared so much on borders.looking wise it is looking so old.
5,Terror at Tenefife: The Canary Islands Crash,A true story of a airline crash. A great read that shows you how powerful God is. A good inspirational book.
3,Do you love ironing?,"After the first wash, the sheets were rather wrinkled, especially around the top trim and edges where it shows most. I would not purchase the sheet set again - I have better quality sheets that coordinate well for about the same money and come out of the dryer ready to use."
2,the last two songs are good else keep going try nuggets 2,"my personal opion is that this does not define a great set of psychedelic music rather a misrepresentatin of bad 50's cut's like stuff buddy holly would have left on the floor however the last two songs are worth there money. perhaps if amazon allows you should download those songs. else keep going if your looking for psychedelic music. my suggestions are nuggets 2, the deep six, the essential pebbles and the yankee dollar or whale feather."
2,cheap,"No sound with cats and resonator, so I took them off and now there's sound, but its rattling appart. Love the sound of it now, but wish it was better made"
3,S.W.A.T. Auto Alarm,"The first one I received did not work properly. I sent it back and it was replaced with no problem, they even had a note in the box that they opened and tested it. Be aware that the alarm is obsolete, the manufacturer stopped making it about 6 years ago. It also goes through a 9-volt battery in about 2 months. But as a cheap deterrent it is fine."
4,Great for Reading and Listening To Spoken Spanish,"What's really excellent about this book is the CD (and computer program) that accompanies it. I put the recordings straight on my iPod, and while going about my day I practice listening to the reader to understand spoken Spanish. I might not understand EVERY word, but after a few tries I can understand most of what is being said. Then when back at home, I read the story and make connections between written Spanish and spoken pronunciation. Thus, this book kills two birds with one stone - reading and listening comprehension.Overall, it's well-designed. It starts from the beginning and helps you advance to more intermediate reading passages. Plus, it's actually fun!"
4,An Excellent Reader,"This book is well organized and well-thought. The stories don't get too old as time goes by. The book is already 10 years old, but remains updated. A good choice for novice reader. It would have helped if the book was accompanied by an audio CD."
2,There are better readers out there,"My students hated this book. I read it years ago but it was far too boring for my eighth grade class. If you're looking for a reader, I'd recommend the Blaine Ray series. It's easy vocabulary; the first book uses only 300 words and has 9 chapters. I had my students read a chapter for homework and then we acted it out in class."
3,Took too long to mail to us,We got a great price and great envelopes but wow took so long to get to us..... Don't know if we will do this again.
4,Josie Pigeon is a different kind of sleuth,"I found the premise of this mystery interesting. Josie Pigeon heads an all woman construction company. She finds a body on a job site and soon after it disappears. Josie is determined to find the body and the killer. She enlists the help of a newcomer to the island. He owns the liquor store, but was formerly a prosecuting attorney. Every one is a suspect, including the construction crew. All of them seem to have a secret!"
1,Ugh!,"This is one of the worst mysteries I have read in quite a while. There is no chemistry between the two main characters. And when the killer is revealed, it makes no sense! Why did they do it? And what really happened to the body! Not worth the time."
5,by far the best of the best,"i was turned on to van morrison when i was 14, and boy this album captures truly the greatest songs that he ever recorded. i highly recommend this album verses the greatest hits."
5,It stirs my soul at any time,"This album has so much power. Whenever I listen to any of the songs on the radio or in the movies as background music, I feel so emotionally stirred. In my life starting from Tokyo now in upstate New York, this album somehow supports my sentiment long before I actually own it. It is truly mystic."
4,Van is the Man!,Ah... The incomparable Van Morrison! Another classic album I needed to replace and be able to play in the car.
3,Get Astral Weeks....,"Old van the man eh? I'd get this just for And it stoned me which is well worth the price of the CD, but I can't help thinking the rest of the record sounds like a movie soundtrack. I wish he didn't write brown eyed girl because it ruined his artistic stance after it was in that movie with Julia Roberts. Even when I play Astral weeks some jerk has something to say about brown eyed girl which is annoying, the blows anyway like my torch as you can see. Get Astral Weeks for the real thing, don't get burned by my torch though and watch out!"
3,Convenient,"This is quite convenient for those with impaired use of hands or wrist, but one must be careful to avoid covering some cards."
1,Worst adapter ever...,This wireless adapter worked better as a book end in my home than it's intended purposes.not recomended
1,Very poor performance,"I ordered this adaptor to replace a wireless G adaptor that I've had for a few years. I also purchased a new Linksys wireless N router. After several hours on the phone with Linksys I got it working, but discovered that it was actually slower than the wireless G router I currently have. Tech support couldn't figure out any way to get it performing better so I returned it and I'm sticking with the G for now.Regarding customer service, I have had numerous Linksys products and I'm not sure why I keep putting myself through the headache. I'm 99% sure that their tech support is based out of India which isn't unique but makes it difficult to communicate. As a general rule, I have found their tech support to be the worst I've ever dealt with."
5,Works with World of Warcraft for Me,"I see some folks mentioned that they can't play World of Warcraft (WoW) with this adapter. I'm playing WoW with this at a great speed.Things to try if you have trouble: Download the newest drivers. The ones in the box are old (at least the CD i got was a few versions old). Try changing the Radio Band to Normal. Try different Channels (like 11). Stop & Disable the ""Wireless Zero Configuration"" in the ""Adminstrative Tools -> Services ..."" section. There other things to try on various forums if you search around.I have the Linksys 330N Gaming Router and things work great for me playing Warcraft."
3,Slow but compelling,"The pace of this film will be too slow for some people, but I found it to be interesting and engaging, and I wanted to see what would happen next (don't read too many reviews; there are unmarked spoilers among them!).The main character, Kaja, sings ""Amazing Grace"" on Christmas Eve with her church choir near the end of the movie, and I found the symbolism of the lyrics to be particularly appropriate.Though not all the issues are revolved (or even addressed) by the end of the film, and it's certainly not a neat and pat ending, it is, nevertheless, satisfying and hopeful. I'm a very harsh movie critic, so even though I've only given it three stars, to me, that means that it's a solidly watchable film."
3,Good game but...,I found four property cards that were labeled different than what was on the game board. Kinda confusing and annoying when playing.
2,Not for dieting,"Beautiful design, well made, made to last. But these bowls are way too big. I put one serving of cereal in one of these bowls and it was like ""that's it??!?!"" Makes servings look like you're trying to feed a bird. So if you assume portion size by looks alone you'll be disappointed. I would recommend this bowl as a salad bowl but not for cereal or soup unless you like to eat.. alot. These bowls do not fit in my dishwasher very well. If you microwave anything in these, be careful!! the bowl gets very hot as it absorbs the heat. Great and colorful but not practical."
5,Worked for me!,"One thing I should have done before using my Le Creuset grill pan is READ the manual! Apparently cast iron can function on a much lower heat than metal pans, so naturally I turned the heat up fairly high to grill some chicken and apparently that is a no, no with cast iron. Due to the pan overheating, my marinade got stuck to the bottom and I thought it would never come off. After letting the pan completely cool, I soaked it in water and reg. dish washing soap for a few hours and most of the marinade came off. But for the rest, nothing seemed to take off the stains but this! I am very glad I purchased this to complete my Le Creuset set. It's something nice to have on hand for those stubborn stains that regular dishwashing soap can't remove."
5,Works as well as advertised,"I've used my 7 1/4 qt French Oven about once a week over the past 2 yrs, and I put some serious stains on the finish. I was skeptical about this product based on some negative reviews I read here (associated with other marketplace merchants), and the extent of the stains on my pot. But it worked as advertised -- pretty much removed every stain and mark on the finish with just a few wipes of a paper towel."
5,Love it,This is a wonderful cleaner for Le Creuset cookware. Sometimes the inside bottoms of my pots get a little dull looking and this cleaner makes them look new again. It is also great for removing dark smudges from the outside bottoms of the pots.
2,Use it from the start,"If I had used this product from the time I first purchased my pans, it probably would have worked well enough for maintenance. Unfortunately I purchased it after my pans became stained and it just doesn't work well enough. I've had much better luck with cheap meat tenderiser mixed with water until it's a medium paste."
3,It sort of worked.,I am glad that I purchased this cleaner but I must say that while it did remove some of the spots and stains on my Le Creuset Dutch oven it by no means removed everything. My pot is about 3 years old and gets used on average probably 4 days a week. By now it is really showing its age. I was hoping this would restore it to at least a somewhat newer looking pot but it didn't. I also disagree with the directions to put it on and then wipe off almost immediatly. I had to leave it on for a minute or two to get it to work.
4,"too big for smaller bikes, but it's a great pack","It's a well constructed pack, with plenty of room for your phone, keys, bike tools, pump, etc. It's just too big for a smaller sized frame. I ride a Marin San Rafael 15"", and the bag is just too big to fit comfortably. Forget having a bottle cage attached if you try to use this pack, the pack takes up every bit of space, and sticks out far enough on the sides to rub on my legs while I ride. If you have a bigger bike, this bag is great, but on smaller bikes, pass on it."
1,Opposite of what I want to teach my son,This book is exactly the opposite of everything I'm trying to teach my child about his big boy bed. It talks about how he can play and read in bed and get out of bed whenever he wants. This book even includes a page where the boy goes into his sleeping baby sister's crib and pokes his hand in and touches the baby! Are you kidding me? That is a serious safety issue. Who wrote this thing?
4,A big help,"Thank you to the illustrator for making the child look slightly girly. I'm reading it to my daughter as ""My big girl bed""And thank you to the author for solving most of our big-bed problems. My daughter loves to see the little child acting naughty (like NoDavid by Shannon, and PleaseBabyPlease by Lee) She imitates my mommy-voice as she scolds the child in the book to ""go back to bed right now"""
5,Already an experienced VB programmer? This book is for you!,"Being a VB Consultant and a VB Teacher, I've had the opportunity to go through many VB books. By far, VB4 Unleashed is the best. If you're already a good VB programmer, VB4 Unleashed will take you further. You'll learn how-to easily add sound (.wav) to your applications, how-to make screen savers, and even help files. Best part is that there is NO need to purchase any additional third-party controls in order to use the examples. (E.G. Learn Visual Basic in 21 days requires purchase of 3rd party OCX controls to use many of the examples.) I highly recommend this book. Kevin Scott, Visual Basic Application Developer, First Logic Inc."
3,Nice Mic BUT it seems to me cheesey that Sony does not INCLUDE battery.,"This mic seems quite good for its intended purpose. Quite sensitive. Appears to be well made, and has cloth covered cord rather rubber or plastic. That's very useful to keep noise from transfering down the cord itself when moving around.My only complaint is that Sony does NOT include the batter you need to use to operate the mic with any device that does not have plug-n-power circuit. So, to use this mic out of the box with many devices, you'll need to truck on over to the store to get the battery you need. That's pretty lame, I think."
4,Not quite progressive enough,"I am just now getting accquainted with Griffin's Corp series, and overall I think it is very good. This is the 3rd in the series, and actually didn't progress any in relation to time and history. Griffin instead used the same period of time from book II and further developed characters, historical events and relationships. While this is not all bad, I was hoping to have progressed further in the story at books end. All in all, still a good read, and I have now started book IV, so I guess he did manage to further reel me in. Enjoy!"
3,portable cd player,The player works fine but the headphones are very uncomfortable - too narrow and tight. I'm going to radio shack and buy some comfortable ones.
2,disappointed,"This is the first Alice Munroe book I have read. It came so highly recommended that, perhaps, I looked forward to it too much. The characters are so central to the stories that if you don't find them real, there is little else of interest. I felt detatched from most of them and so, was just reading about people I didn't care about. There is also some sort of cold feminism running through them- smart women are misfits and men are minamally drawn. I hope my next Munroe book strikes a better chord."
3,Interesting Read,This was a good book to read on a holiday because of the short stories (some shorter than others). This was the first of Ms. Munro's books that I have read and I will read others.
4,This book was just okay.,"I don't remember very much about this book. Sometimes I get tired of reading ""coming of age"" stories. I have read several stories that are similar to this. This was also a book selection and I might have preferred another book for discussion."
4,"Deep, dark and provocative stories","The simple and everyday take on meaning and nuance in this collection of stories. Munro's style is dark, verging on maudlin, but she always seems to pull back at the right time so that the plots don't come off as completely overblown. The book's title takes its name from the introductory story that centers around a confused and weary runaway wife, but the better (to me) stories were the ones that followed, all of whom deal with the pathos of being female. If you're a woman between the ages of 20 and 65 you'll relate in some way."
2,uxojoe,"A very unpleasant read. White uses hundreds of words to say things that could be otherwise communicated in only a few sentences. Many of his comments, if you take time to think about them, make no sense at all, or are stating the completely obvious-- things like music takes place in the scope of time. What? No kidding. Who exactly was unclear about that? He goes on for pages trying to explain concepts as obvious as that. Here's another one; Christian worship requires space, as in three-dimensional space. There's news. He talks about that for a chapter that's 30 pages long!There are some interesting historical bits to the book, but they are relayed in the most uninteresting way. I would encourage anyone to find another book. This one, at least to me, was miserable. (This book is used as a textbook for a class I'm taking)"
5,Haul Ass,"For a low profile box has great holding capacity. Recomend to others. Looks great on my Dodge Truck. Very easy to install, Out of carton and installed in 10 minutes. Will check other items from you."
1,Exciting! Drone on and on and on and on and on.And on again,"This has to have been the worst Op-Center book I have so far read [I haven't read Mirror Image or Balance of Power] Call me naive, but the others are good stories, though not accurate. But this story was exciting in the begining, but after Rodgers was captured, it just droned on and on and on, and on some more. Rodgers decides to stand resolute, then as soon as someone's threatened, he folds, then goes back to the brave american during torture. All side plots are useless, and Clancy goes on about the technology used. I had to check my pulse to make sure I was alive when reading it. Clancy has delivered good stories before, but this is not one of them."
4,Op-Center Fan,"I have enjoyed all of the Clancy Op-Center books I've read, and this one is no different. ""Games of State"" has an entertaining and exciting story line with a great cast of characters. I still prefer the regular Tom Clancy novels, but the Op-Center books are a nice change of pace."
2,"Not realistic, nor is it entertaining.","This is a very weak effort. Why does Clancy feel the need to churn out so many books? Hasn't he taken enough of our money? He keeps on putting works like this out with his name on them, he will lose his readers. You want good special operations fiction? Try Bob Mayer's series of books. He's got six that revolve around special operations missions that are outstanding."
2,Read real Special Ops stuff-- not this,"I bought some books in the JFK Special Warfare Museum during my last trip to Bragg that kick ass. By Bob Mayer, they are a series on Special Forces with a fictional character Dave Riley. Looked them up here-- most are out of print although Eyes of The Hammer is still selling. Check Bob's web site for these books. Also found from that site that he writes under other names now-- check out THE OMEGA MISSILE under the name Joe Dalton and even AREA 51 under the name Robert Doherty. Same guy; great stuff."
3,Weak effort-- why so many books?,"I'm not sure I understand why Tom Clancy feels the need to put his name on so many books, computer games, tv shows, etc. There is no doubt there has been a decline in quality since his early books-- this is a clear example. I did as a reviewer below suggested and tried Bob Mayer's special forces series and found the books I could get enjoyable but wonder why I can't get all six."
1,Tom Clancy R.I.P.,"If you love the ""Jack Ryan"" Clancy, for God's sake stay away from this amatuer attempt at suspense. Its soooo politically correct. The heros, regularly faced with life and death decisions, without fail do the right thing, just in the brink of time. Its beyond predictible. I end up hoping a hero dies just to put some believability into the story. Its not like you could develop any sympathy for the Flash Gordon wannabe charactors. Oh Tom, if you can hear me up there in your cammo colored tower, get rid of that quasi-co-author Steve fellow and get back to writing the good stuff."
5,If you like Clancy You can't miss this!!!!!!!,"IF you like a real page turner get this book. There is no Tom Clancy book like this one. Miss you wedding, Miss you father's Funural, but don't miss this book!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,A pale imitation of Clancy's earlier work,"If you were looking for anything like _Hunt for Red October_or _Patriot Games_, you'll be sorely disappointed. Thoughthis has Clancy's name on the cover, it's clear that it'sjust a cheap sell-out of his name. Inside, it's justa poorly thought-out, sub-average spy story, with noneof the strong characters of his ""real"" work. Give it amiss, and avoid all of the derivative ""Op Center"" books.."
4,Acts of War,"I thought the premise was great- Very realistic and entertaining. I am a big Clancy fan, and although I've seen some negative reviews on this novel, I thought it was well written. It kept my attention the whole way through and provided for some tense action and excitement. Good job Tom- keep up the great work!"
4,Best so far,"I wasn't a big fan of the first two op center books, but this one shows definite improvement."
1,Prolific Doesn't Equal Good,"So my mind started wandering midway through Sum of All Fears and it hasn't come back to Tom Clancy since. I started Op-Center mainly because it was a short book and I figured I could ease my way back into Clancy's little world. My mistake. The book is nearly unreadable and appears to be an attempt to just get another book out there. I was genuinely stunned at the quality of the first four books (Red Storm, Red October, Patriot Games, Clear and Present), but enough already. We all know you wish you were Jack Ryan, but you're not. Every time I see a Tom Clancy book I see puffy Tom with his shaded prescription glasses, the wannabe flight jacket and his dead serious accountant's face. I guess it doesn't help that when I met him at a book signing he could barely be bothered to lift his eyes to the customers. He's laughing all the way to the bank, and it's my fault - I bought the books. No more."
3,Time for the President to shut down Op-Center,"Nowhere near as superb as the first Op-Center, Games of State or the NBC TV movie. This one plods along at snails pace at first, has an old-hat plot . . .can`t we think of anything better than the Middle East crisis? The brilliant Executive Orders had a Middle East situation to end all pulp fiction on that subject. The action and technical expertise does kick off in the second half, however as the ROC finds its way into the hands of the Kurds . . .this does make up for the lacsadaisical pacing which causes one to ponder the implausibilities. Why put an expensive piece of military hardware in a trouble-spot anyway, except to churn out an unneccesarry sequel? Tom, stick to what you do best, the Jack Ryan series, SSN, Red Storm Rising. Technothrillers rule, old hat pulp fiction`s good for a plane read but not much else."
5,Hard Time Country,"Wonderful Album. Actually heard it on the BBC where it hit #2 in their Americana charts. Saw him in person last week, ABSOLUTELY UNBELIVABLE!!!"
4,Enjoyable read dispite historical inaccuracies,"This was an enjoyable read dispite some inaccuracies until i reached the Epilogue. The errors here cast doubt on the entire book. He has the book's hero composing the ""Santiago Rag"" for Roosevelt's 1906 inagural ball. Roosevelt was elected in 1904 and his ball held in 1905. The hero is discharged from Camp Wickoff instead of Camp Wikoff. Since Wickoff appears more than once, it does not appear to be a typo. In successive sentences he has Roosevelt becoming President in 1901 and ""reelected"" in 1906. Roosevelt was ELECTED (not reelected) President in 1904. When did the President's term become 5 years? Wood did not go to the Philippines until 1903 when the rebellion had already been put down. These are errors that are obvious and detract from the book."
1,Bad style,"The book is incredibly difficult to read from cover to cover. Instead of just getting to the point, there is so much verbiage as to make the whole thing unintelligible. The examples, with the VCR/TV analogy in the first chapter, were simply confusing and could have been made more clear IMHO.Better to try another COM/ATL book"
3,Rabbit's Foot Fern,Was very full when it arrived. Quite a few of froundshave died but if the rest make it should be okay.Little early to tell what the final results will be.Was surprised there were no planting or careinstructions with the plant. Hoping for the best.
3,OK for an inexpensive jack,Works fine but the pipe for raising the jack and opening/closing the valve is cheap and flimsy. I would of expected a more solid assembly of teh pipe.
5,"God at work in ""God At Work""","Gene Veith has provided us with another wonderfully readable, but thoroughly theological book -- this time on the doctrine of vocation. His Biblical insights into this most important topic are a joy to study and consider, and in his writing he has done the Church a great service!"
5,Challenging,"This book helped me realize my own strengths and weaknesses in my vocation. The message is especially inspiring to me, as I've struggled to understand my work in relation to God's call. I recommend it to anyone striving to serve Him, while living in the real world."
2,Fun while it lasted...,It worked for a day or two and then it would no longer communicate with the xbox. Restarted multiple times and nothing. Had to return it.
5,SUPER GREAT CASE!,"THIS IS A SUPER GREAT CASE! AND A LOW PRICE! THE ONLY BAD PART IS WHEN YOU OPEN THE BOTTOM STORAGE THE TOP CLEAR PLASTIC WILL NOW BE HITTING THE GROUND AND WILL VERY EASY GET SCUFFED-UP! BUT I WOULD BUY THIS AGAIN, IT HOLDS ALOT!"
1,fanciful and silly,"Conway seems to have made this stuff up out of her own head. A little bit of Norse this and that on top of modern wicca and her own imagination is what it appears to me. It's kinda fun, but I doubt if any Norse pagans ever did anything remotely close to this. It's hard to believe stuff like this gets published. I'm sorry I spent my money on it."
3,Norse Magic Review,The book's okay... just don't open it expecting to do Norse Traditional magic from it... as it's more like the Author's take on fitting Norse mythology to the Wiccan Framework of Religion.
2,huh,"okay this is my first book i read on norse mythology and it seems alot like wicca, i dont no much about norse mythology but i do know alot about wicca, this book seems like wicca with a norse twist, i was very disappointed usually i like conways books but not this one, this one was just bad"
1,Doesn't work,It doesn't work on my modest 2.8ghz p4 with 1.5 gb ram machine. Buy at your own risk. It also gives errors of the same type I have to many other users according to the forums.
1,Video Problems,Installed this on a Dell that is less than a year old the screen image has the top half of the image on the botton and the bottom half of the image on the top. This is obviously irritating. E-mail Sierra support but have not received any reply.
4,Great nostalgia lane games,"I appreciated the quick shipping of the CD that contains a series of 6 games. I had played them with my son in the 80's in a DOS PC and they were fun.These games now run on XP, although the response is a bit jittery. While they cannot compete with present day graphics and sound, the humor and relatively low level of violence is refreshing. Now there are a lot of walkthroughs available to help playing them.SO I highly recommend the merchant and the product."
4,Rings with the Possibility of Truth,"She always said, ""I want to live my life, not record it."" In this fictional memoir, however, we see what could have been, behind Jackie's famous, oversized sunglasses.From childhood to death and through many a bedroom, Francisco imagines the most intimate moments of her life with skillful, poetic imagery. Tragic at times, sensationalist at others, this novel rings with the possibility of truth."
4,"Beautiful,","Heavy with strong, rich colors.. a nice serving plate for a crowd ... or I use it for fruit on the table."
5,A read to be savored!!,"I deliberately waited until I went on vacation to read this book so I could truly savor the experience. The plot is deliciously devious, but what really stands out to me is the pace of the plot, unfolding step by step, clue by clue, revelation by revelation. The reader is drawn into the story at the pace of the characters. This is not literary ""fast food"" but a novel to be leisurely explored, taking time to enjoy the word craft and each new development. Relax and enjoy a great read!"
5,GREEN DAY ROCK!!!!!!,"I just love this CD! Green Day know how to rock, man! The best song is Brain Stew!!!!"
3,Another good cd from Green Day,"Insomniac is not exactly what I expected but it is still a very solid album. Punk fans may be a bit disappointed because of its alternative/heavy metal edge, from tracks like Brain Stew (the best song on he cd). But fans will still get their dose of punk from a few songs. All in all, Green Day fans should be pleased with this one."
5,How the People of the Bible really lived,"I felt really privileged to be able to have this book on hand. It serves to make the lands and people of the Bible times come alive as it describes details from facts, some long known and often newly discovered. One can tell that these authors spent countless hours compiling all that goes into this book. Delightful photographs."
5,good to have it .,thanks for making it available.Was in search of such a book for a long time.Good book for studying the bible.
3,"Excellent Music,Annoying Vocals","I really hate to rain on everyone's parade.I purchased Angular Perceptions based on these reviews.Musically,Michael Harris has formed a ""dream team' of a group.The interplay and structure of this music is impeccable.I do,however,have a major problem with Ted Leonard's vocals. Some restraint and subtle textures would be nice.I find his need to be a Bruce Dickinson/Rob Halford clone counterproductive to such incredible music.Maybe he can join Kansas and that will make everyone happy."
4,Technically Sound,"There's no doubt this group is technically phenominal. The guitar playing is amazing (absolutely amazing!) and the vocals are soaring. Unfortunately, the songs are not quite up to par with the musicianship: tons of technical wizardy overpowers emotion and message. Great promise, not yet achieved."
3,AZU Baby Outfit,Disappointed with the quality for the price. Since my grandson quickly grew out of it; it did not go to waste; but for the price would have expected embrodery instead of iron ons. Embrodery was implied in the ad.
5,Fun fun fun,"This book is a treat, let me tell you. It's the perfect read for a lazy summer day, or any day of the year, actually. This author is sure to become a favorite!"
1,Bad Design - Battery dies after a couple of years,"I am so disappointed in my Sonicare. Once the battery decides not to recharge anymore, there is absolutely NOTHING that you can do! You have to replace the entire unit. I am very, very disappointed. What a SCAM!"
5,Extraordinary,"Once in a while, someone touches upon something that makes us step out of our ordinary lives and into a larger world. This book and companion CD (not available through amazon I noticed, but through Summit Records) is like a breath of fresh air - a love affair with an aspect of the universe that we all hold dear. Read it once, twice - over and over - it commands new meaning with each experience..."
5,tried and tested,"I bought this mask as soon as it hit the market. Actually, before it hit the market. I placed my order before it was even availible for shipment. Anyway, the mask is worth every penny. I paid considerably more than you can buy the mask today. I officiate high school and college ball, and I wear this mask with no fear. I have taken several foul balls right in the grill and the mask has performed masterfully. I have owned probably 5 masks in 15 years and this has been my favorite, hands down. All of the former models were top of the line products as well. The Wilson Dyna-Lite, The Wilson Zero Gravity, The +Pos composite, all masks in the $100.00 range. No better than this trusty little Diamond mask at almost half the price. Buy the mask, save the money, and you will be yet another satisfied customer."
3,Seatown Funk!,"Former D-Shot pupils now have the chance to shine on their own, and the result is fairly better than their previous EP ""Takin' Ends"". They've upped their lyrics and flow, and come with more diversity in music too. (their old CD, being 6 tracks long, didn't show what they really had to offer)."
5,Excellent drama plus family values!,"A fast moving novel, with a believable story line. Fun to read, but very thought provoking in the area of family values, also."
3,Interesting Christian medical drama,"Co-written by an emergency room medical Doctor and his wife based in Southwest Missouri this book takes the subject of medical drama and adds a Christian perspective to it. I haven't read much of the book (my mother had it and I've bought a copy as a gift)but I see that the author's mention a real hospital or two in southwest Missouri as well as a couple of real towns (I don't think there is really a Knoll but there is a town called Noel).I'm curious as to which real hospital the Doctor works at, it would be interesting to know if the difficult patient/ Doctor plots are in any way based in reality. I think the Christian faith is a constant theme throughout but it is handled well, no fraud ministers, not pushy in display of faith."
1,Only buy it if it's really really cheap,"I got this for a few dollars. It comes with a short book that is only somewhat helpful for beginners, and not at all for anyone else. It comes with chakra cards by Amy Zerner that look almost identical to the tarot deck these two have done and redone. Then there are cheap candles. (and if you run out you can buy more of these cheap tealights for 10 bucks!) Then the CD-it is wretched. Something akin to porn music is in the back ground, and Monte Farber sounds like a voice over from a B science fiction movie from the 50's. Not good.I guess a little knowledge goes a long way with these two, as they keep making more and more new age products, but it doesn't mean it's good."
1,Disappointing CD,"I bought this for the meditations. The messages on the CD are good, but the music is completely inappropriate, and terribly distracting. I try to zone it out, but can't because the speaker occasionally uses it for rhythm. Also, I would have preferred it in mp3 format, so I could listen on the IPod or mp3 player. Naturally, the CD is protected, so I can't do that."
2,It started off ok but had really fallen flat by page 100,"The heroine's view of the world seems cynical so one is forced to spend too much time with a negative woman prone to an attitude of victimization. One moment she seems to be slipping into self pity and the next she is 'proudly' declaring her independence. These sporatic reversals make her character hard to believe or sympathize with. Ultimately, her character is rather weak and unappealing. I had to stop reading the book when I encountered a truly absurd plot twist that I felt was merely a cheap device the author used to avoid having to think of a sincere way that these two people could fall in love."
5,Cantatas by BWV Number and Name. Gardiner's Pilgramage Continues...,"The pilgramage continues with the latest installment Volume 21. Gardiner's interpretations are brilliant as ever and the works chosen for Volume 21 are equally bright. This disc set is a must to add to your pilgramage collection or if not to begin the pilgramage here. Listed below are the cantatas named with corresponding BWV number (since Amazon has yet to list them at the time of this brief review).Cantata herein:Disc 1BWV 22 - Jesus nahm zu sich die ZwölfeBWV 23 - Du wahrer Gott und Davids SohnBWV 127 - Herr Jesu Christ, wahr' Mensch und GottBWV 159 - Sehet! Wir gehn hinauf gen JerusalemDisc 2BWV 182 - Himmelskönig, sei willkommen (for Palm Sunday / Annunciation)BWV 54 - Widerstehe doch der Sünde (for the Third Sunday in Lent - Oculi) (Nathalie Stutzmann solo Alto)BWV 1 - Wie schön leuchtet der Morgenstern (for the Feast of the Annunciation)Happy Pilgrimage!"
2,easily the weakest entry in the Fletch canon,"It probably looked good on paper when McDonald pitched it to his publisher: Fletch gets caught up in a 50-year old murder mystery, and with people trying to kill him currently he has to solve the old mystery to simultaneously solve the new.In practice, this book is a rambling mess that barely touches on any of the above-mentioned elements. There's a lot of Brazilian ""flavor"" that ultimately felt like filler. There's also a lengthy subplot involving some party boys known as The Tap Dancers that I will generously call a red herring, as (minor spoiler) it has nothing to do with the over-all story, even though so much time is devoted to it that it feels like it should. (end minor spoiler).If you want to be completionist about the Fletch series, keep your expectations in check and get it from the library. Otherwise, you can safely skip this one."
4,Top notch metal from Germany,"This album from 1985 contains good solid european heavy metal. Armed with a great singer and two outstanding guitar players this is one of those albums every rocker should be familiar with. Apart from getting their best studio album on CD this release offers two tracks recorded live. The sound reminds me of how Accept sounded during this time, and some Judas Priest influences are also evident. Every track on here is a real gem, but if I had to choose my favourite picks would be ""I love the night"", ""The Tiger"" and the heavy ballad ""Breakout"". My only complaint is that the lyrics are a little bit cheesy and sometimes somewhat embarrassing, but nothing worse than you would expect from a band that doesn't have english as their native language. If you like heavy metal from the early 80's this CD is definetively worth checking out!"
4,Decent Bag For The Job,It can be really hard to find a decent bag for the myriad of MIDI controllers on the market now but this one isn't a bad choice for those who don't like the idea of having their precious little 37 key controller just lying about waiting for the elements to attack.I would have preferred if the controller fit more snugly but it's not terrible. having the zippered compartment in front is a handy spot to store the templates that came with my controller and it can easily fit an m-box or other comparable interface plus cables etc.As an added precaution you can simply wrap the controller in a towel so it doesn't slide around too much during transport.Wouldn't recommend you check it on (under the plane) but even without the towel I'd say it would be fine as a carry-on bag for your precious (and expensive) musical equipment.
5,Awsome Soundtrack,"Every single song on this soundtrack is great! I love it, and you will love it too! My fave song is ""get you're shine on"". It is such a variety of songs to listen to, and I think everyone will enjoy this album."
5,AMAZING!,"This CD is truly amazing, you must pick it up when you get the chance! You will not regret it!"
3,Good album.,i bought the album because i liked the tv show when it was on. i recommend this to fans of the tv show only as the songs are good but the album is hardly a classic
3,"good, but no smell","Seems like a good lotion. if nothing else, it does take away dryness very well. haven't used long enough for results on the smoothness."
4,A beautiful adaptation of the novel,"Vanessa Redgrave gives a fine performance as Clarissa Dalloway in Marleen Gorris' adaptation of the Virginia Woolf novel. It tells the story of one day inthe life of Clarissa Dalloway as she readies her house for a dinner party later in the evening. Throughout the day, she remembers people and events from her past that had a lasting effect on her. But, during her party, the news of a suicide causes Mrs. Dalloway to step aside and to wonder if she's given up anything with her own life's path.Ms. Redgrave's performance is subtle and really shines during the party sequence. Her facial expressions alone show what a fine actress she is. Other great performances in the film are Rupert Graves as Septimus, a soldier suffering from a late onset of shell shock, and Alan Cox, as the young Peter who was desparately in love with the young Clarissa.Not many extras on the DVD. But the film is self is definitely one to watch."
2,Why?,"Why did they make this movie? The young Mrs. Dalloway (before she was that) was extremely annoying running around and laughing - maybe it's just that giggling women give me hives. But Vanessa Redgrave is wonderful in everything - I like just watching her. That's why I bought this... And I must say that she does shine. But the movie was a bust.If you're a movie fanatic (as I am) - get this. Otherwise - get a grip. This is not ""The Hours""."
2,Would not recommend.,I didn't like the multiple persons telling the story & the characters should have been much more defined. They had no depth.
2,Mediocre At Best,"As a fan of Gates of Fire, I eagerly snatched up Last of the Amazons when it came out. To say I was disappointed is an understatement! This novel covers the love triangle of Amazon Warrioresses, the Greeks that tempted them (and eventually brought about their downfall), and their Amazon lovers.The narrative is painfully slow and dry with pieces of over-the-top dialogue that could only have been written by a man. An example, ""You reek of mare-stink from between your thighs..."" Puh-leez!What could have been a great book exploring the Amazon culture turned into a boring treatise on horsemanship in ancient times. If you like historical novels, treat yourself to the Roma Sub Rosa series by Steven Saylor or even Colleen McCullough's Masters of Rome series. Pressfield, while a great scholar, just doesn't have the narrative prowess to pull off a novel."
3,More of a question tha n a review,"my wife is wondering what is the reason that this item in particular is so dramatically reduced compared to other T-Fal ultraglide irons, although this model seems in the picture to be as sophisticated. Is there any reason that we should know of so that we opt for another T-Fal model?thanks"
5,"Looks like a Powder, but will Last my Betta a lifetime ;)","My betta was hesitant about eating it at first (he's picky lol), but when i threw a tinsy bit of his old food in there with him he went at it. My sister's goldfish went positivelly ballistic over it lmao. This bottle will last my betta for his lifetime - way more in it and larger than I expected, which is wonderful! The daphnia are small, and almost powder-like. Perfect for my tiny little betta."
3,Eureka 1210,"Big, roomy, plenty of head room and the most annoying rain fly I've ever encountered in my life. Those who say it leaks don't know the first thing about using a ground tarp or seam sealer. Mostly I like it (but the rain fly really bites!)"
5,To Kenya and back with no problems,"I have yet to use this tent, but I loaned it to friends traveling to Kenya. It survived the international flights both ways and proved to be a roomy and sturdy home for them during their stay there. Pretty good endorsement, I'd say."
3,OK - good for beginners,"This is the ONLY book on Cognos' Impromptu I have been able to find. Cognos has online documentation that has similar information. This book is not for Administrators. Impromptu admins can get adequate how-to-use information from Impromptu's documentation CD. I know of no source of best practices information, particularly things like how to organize a catalog, naming standards, etc. except to take Cognos' classes.Overall, better than nothing, and the only thing available in a real book."
2,Baby likes it ok,"1. It was not the same as the photo, but I was too lazy to contact Amazon about it.2. Baby only likes it slightly."
3,picture and sound not the best,"arrived as stated,i love the old westerns,but with this set there is some picture and sound issues. the b/w is not a prob.all fans of westerns should watch WANTED:DEAD OR ALIVE.Steve Mcqueen was great."
2,broken case,"When I received this item, the dvd case was busted to smithereens, in such a way as not to be repairable.Needless to say I am quite disappointed."
3,I really really wanted to like this,"I love babywearing and have several different carriers. I wanted something really uncomplicated that I could also nurse in discreetly, so I thought I'd give this a try. I tried several different positions, and side carrying seemed the easiest, but it still took a lot of adjustment, and I could never get it that comfortable. The shoulder padding made it impossible to wear my purse, as my purse kept sliding off the padding. The ring dug into my upper chest, and my neck felt strained afterwards. The fabric also seemed really thin, and I heard a couple of stitch-pops whenever I tried to tighten the fabric in the ring, which concerned me. I still keep it in my car in case I need to use it for nursing or napping, but otherwise I'm sticking with my ergo."
3,Not much practical dating advice,"Girl Meets Girl is a pretty entertaining book and one of the first lesbian dating/advice books I have purchased. It has a lot of advice about trying to get a girl but it seems pretty ignorant of trans* issues, despite talking about trans* people in the book. She seemed to dismiss transsexual men as women and as being in a lesbian relationship, which was a huge problem for me. I also was turned off by her recommendation of the Michigan Women's Music Festival, a notoriously transmisogynistic musical festival held in Michigan. Why would you want to date someone who would attend functions like that, even if you aren't trans?"
2,Information Not Available Elsewhere - But Abysmally Written,"If you're interested in the evolution of computing in the early days of the U.S. military Cryptanalysis you need to have this book on your shelf. The author is clearly a great researcher. And the book gives tantalizing hints about systems not mentioned anywhere else.But at least at the time he wrote this book, he was unable to put together a coherent narrative. There are multiple stories being told here - none of them coherently. And I'm not convinced the author actually understood computer architecture or cryptography - a handicap in tackling this subject.I only wish he could go back and rewrite this."
5,Perfect Gameing!!!,This game system might be a less better than the 3DS but this works excelent. I had bought this from walmart because the price was $20 lower then amazons price but this console is good no problem yet so this is a good buy for any gameing king or queen.
5,Kids and Adults can enjoy,"There's a game on this device that people from any walk of life can enjoy. I don't even need to list them, any job/intrest/hobby/advneture of a game is eithier coming out soon or already available for the Nintendo DS. They're pretty durable too, accidently dropped mine a couple times, and still works perfectly."
4,"Great system, can't say i'm fond of touch screen controls too muct though.","System wise it's great, it does everything it was designed to do, but that is also it's weakness, as the touch screen controls aren't used enough in games to make it worth implementing, and beyond that, the touch controls aren't for everyone.Game wise it's loaded even better than the current generation of home consoles, making it very much worthy of it's title of handheld king.Basically, if you want a handheld with a plethora of games for all types, the DS is the handheld for you, however if you want it for the touch controls, it's best to research the games first, as not all of the DS lineup has touch controls."
2,Nintendo DS,This is the first product I've recieved from amazon that I wasn't completely satisfied with. It's not like new at all and for the price I was surprised at how filthy the game was when I recieved it. I wanted to give it to my son for Christmas but I can't bring myself to do it... so I'm going to purchase another one at the original price that is new and not like new. Like new to me means clean and used just a little.
5,bueno,llegaron en perfecto estado y sin ningún detalle en particular por parte de los vendedores... los recomiendo cien por ciento.
5,What fun!,"I bought this so I had something to do on long flights, namely layovers. It's convenient, small enough to stow easily, and very entertaining. I now use it at hotels when I'm in other cities for something to do other than watch television. I'm buying another one for my teenage daughter so she'll leave mine alone!"
4,"Great fun, not as durable as it should be","I bought this for my 5yr old son. He loves it and it keeps him very entertained as well as some good educational games. The only problem was that he dropped it after 2 months and the top screen no longer works. We also have a gameboy that has been dropped, chewed on by the dog, gotten wet and it still works fine. This toy is alot of money, maybe he was just too young for it."
5,Best handheld system yet!,It's lighter more sleek design blows the original DS away. The screens illuminate your game play to a whole other level. Definitely worth buying!
5,Really Pretty Blue color.,My son bought this with birthday/christmas money. He is loving it. The game came to us in great shape and a really good price. It was so nice to see his face when it came to the house he had been checking the mailbox daily. I have to say I was impressed by the delivery it was really quick.
3,Neat idea,I bought this for my 6 year old. She loves it but can not fully utilize the games she got because her reading is not great. It may have been a little too early for her.
5,Just what he wanted !,"I could not find a DS Lite for my son. It was what he wanted most for Christmas. I ordered it with free shipping from Amazon and it arrived in a little over one week, in plenty of time for Christmas. My son loves it, the DS Lite works great, and I actually paid less than I expected."
5,Wonderful!,"I bought this to replace my ""old"" Nintendo DS. What a difference. Not that there was anything wrong with my other DS, it is just that this one is smaller, brighter, and lighter."
1,2 gone bad in 6 months,Nintendo DS Lite Cobalt / BlackPurchased a Gold one for my grandson in December for his birthday and after 5 months it froze up and would not turn off. I was told I would have to purchase another one because if was not worth fixing. So because my grandson got outstanding grades at school I purchased him a new one Cobalt Blue....after 2 weeks the top screen loses it color at times or will get lines running through it. Hopeful they will cover it under their warranty this time. Now of course my grandson is thrilled with it when it works.
5,Nintendo DS Lite.,"Excellent gaming system! The children love it at their leisure because they can spend hours and hours playing the excellent titles (which as usual) has Nintendo consoles. This system has very good price, the battery life is excellent and great gameplay!"
2,it was ok,I bought the game 4 my daughter for her birthday .the console is not Wat i expect u cn hardly hear on it& i dnt hv a hearing problem
4,Good,"The product was as described! My 8 year old grandson likes it! We have only tried it a couple days, but it seems to be fine."
5,DS Lite,I have very pleased with this purchase and the prompt delivery. We have been playing non-stop since getting this DS. I reccommend amazon for all my purcahses so far. Even this HP Probook 4530 that I'm using to write this.
5,Great killing time in the car on the way to Vegas,"I love this versus the older model of course, I was able to see my game even in bright sunlight. Battery life is great."
4,We will see,"So far so good. I have actually bought Nintendo DS from ebay, and I was told that they were brand new, but when I got them either a couple of weeks, if not months, buttons didn't work, or the game continued to shut off out of no where. So far with this product it is supposedely brand new and I haven't had any issues."
5,EXCITED,"I DIDN'T EXPECT IT TO LOOK AS GOOD AS IT DID. THERE WAS NO SCRATCHES THAT I COULD HARDLY SEE. IT WAS VERY WELL KEPT. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO EVERYONE TO TRY."" YOU WONT BE SORRY!"""
4,"NINTENDO DS - I LOVE IT, BUT THERE ARE A FEW FLAWS.","I LOVE PLAYING MY DS; THOUGH THERE ARE A FEW FLAWS. YOU HAVE TO GO THRU ALL THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR EACH GAME EACH TIME YOU PLAY(MAYBE IT'S DIFFERENT FOR DIFFERENT GAMES, I DON'T KNOW). I HAVE BRAINAGE 1 AND THERE'S A GAME WHERE THE COLOR COMES UP AND YOU HAVE TO SAY THE COLOR. MOST TIMES THE GAME DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THE WORD BLUE. ALSO, IT'S NOT ALWAYS EASY TO SEE IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS. LIKE OUTSIDE ESPECIALLY."
5,Awesome.,"This DS is great. It's lasted every drop, scratch, and anything else. It's all I need when I'm on the road."
4,Great Deal,"The DS is very functional, although it doesn't get played as much as I would have liked.My main praise goes to Amazon... Great deal on the price, especially for Christmas time :)"
4,best ds,this ds was great for traveling.had great picture. sometimes the game did not work.but most of the time it works. very small
5,You get what you pay for!,"As a vast majority of the reviews confirm, this is indeed a nice little gadget. Nintendo basically listened to it's customers and improved on a product that has undoubtably taken a huge share of the handheld videogame market.I have to assume that most of the naysayers are just haters of Nintendo as a company and probably won't ever have anything nice to say about any of their products. The videogame industry has many passionate fans.Alas, the Nintendo DS lite will be as fun as you make it. There are a lot of great games out there (I highly recommend New Super Mario Brothers!) and there are also several games out there not worth the money; so do your homework before buying games you are unsure of. The DS is great value for the money and it will have the support from Nintendo for quite some time."
3,nice but,"I bought two DS,es for my kids one works great but the pink one for my daughter has a problem with the touch screen touching correctly I tried to recalibrate it but it still doesnt work right.."
2,Doesn't work,"When I first got the Nintendo DS Lite in the mail, i was pretty excited. When I opened it up, it looked perfectly fine and it had no scratches or no fingerprints. It look great. In the beginning, it had worked. But when 5 minutes past, it had froze up and stopped working. I thought, ok, that was obviously a rare error. I tried turning it on and off, but whenever it was turned on, it was nothing but a black screen. I've gotten so far as at 2 minutes the MOST playing time, but I mean what would you expect from a used Nintendo DS. If you are going to buy from this user, i recommend you buy a brand new DS apposed to the used ones."
2,NOT RECEIVED MY DS IN THIS MOMENT,HI IN THIS MOMENT NOT RECEIVED MY NINTENDO DS I AM WONG TO WAIT THE DS PLEASE I NEED THE DS THANKS
2,"Why Nintendo, Why??","This is exactly what I hate about Nintendo. I don't know if anyone else has noticed, but it seems they come out with a new gameboy every year, I can't even count how much remakes there were of the original Gameboy, and now with the DS?It seems Nintendo can never get their designs right the first time, this is a waste of money.Buy a Sony PSP if you want to have a game system from a company that knows how to create real entertainment. Great games, movies, music, videos, internet, how can you go wrong? And now it's only 200$, it's well worth it.If you buy a DS, expect to be buying another remake of the system next year."
5,A7X City of Evil,no gaps in high quality hard rock songs. amazing drums and awesome guitar duets. just a great album that i would recommend to all rock music fans
5,Rediculous to Knock this down!!!,"Alright i realize the guy does not scream anymore but give him a break, if u really love this band u know he had throat surgery and is no longer able to, but given the fact that he cant this cd is so awesome, i am glad they decided to do a traditional metal album because it gave the guitarists a chance to shine, screw all of u that say they sold out, u need to go listen to slipknot if u want the same thing over and over again!!!"
2,Vocals ruin a potentially decent hard rock CD,"If you buy this CD, buy it for the excellent dual guitar parts(at least on the 1st half of the album). Synyster Gates has some pretty fast fingers, and the dual guitar gives the CD a kind-of old school metal sound. However, as many people have said, the whiny, nasally vocals realy hurt this album. Actually during most of the verses M. Shadows vocals are at a low enough register that they sound o.k., but when he tries to hit notes that are a little bit higher...yikes! Also, after song 6 or 7 the style changes from fast-paced rock to ... well, I'm not sure what to call it, but it spoils the last half of the album.So overall, this album could have been really good, but it isn't. BUT, all of that being said, the first couple of songs are really pretty good. ""Burn It Down"" almost makes this worth the price alone."
1,Not hardcore at all,"This isn't hardcore at all, it's trendy crap that you would find at Hot Topic. For real hardcore, I recommend Glassjaw, Boysetsfire or better yet pick up some hardcore from the 80's like 7seconds and Circle Jerks. While I don't like those last two bands, they are hardcore, unlike these losers."
2,What happend?,"I thought Avenged Sevenfold was a unique band. They had a great new sound, released two smash hits and were musicaly talented. Now all that is gone. This album sounds like complete trash. There is NO mixing of heavy metal and punk sounds like their other albums and the guitar riffs are all the same and M. Shadows voice sounds like he got kicked in the nuts to hard. It is two bad that the saying ""Third time's a charm"" isn't true anymore. The only reason why it gets two stars is because the art work is kind of cool. If you are new to A7X, don't start with this. Get Waking the Fallen or Sound the Seventh Trumpet. If you are a long time fan, I still wouldn't bother paying 15 dollars for this."
1,BUTTROCK IS BACK,"When i got this CD, i seriously thought it was a joke. It was so cheese filled and their names were so hilarious. When i heard ""strength of the world"" i had to turn it off. It was just too much. ""ICE IN MY VEINS!"" Are these guys from green bay?Yes, they can play their instruments. That's about it. This has got to be one of the most cheesy CD's i've ever heard. Assrock, buttrock, hair rock with double bass and a little of G'N'R is all this CD is. It's nothing new, we've all heard it before.This isn't metal. This is new age assrock. This is metal for the wannbees watching MTV that think eyeliner and black clothes are cool. Go listen to real metal bands like, Converge, Ion dissonance, The Red Chord, Glass Casket, Myrkskog, Yattering, Into the Moat, etc, etc.A7x gives metal a band name. But i'm sure all the kiddies watching MTV will think it's the best thing since Slipknot(LOL, they suck too)."
5,A7X turns the tide of contemporary rock,"this CD is unequivocally the best rock/metal CD of 2005.this band rocks hard, real hard, makes you want to do 100 on the highway.no SCREAMING is a big PLUS. melodic lyrics over some serious guitar solos make this one for the ages. buy this CD immediately even if you are not a metal fan. you wont be disappointed.A7x's first major label LP is a throwback to the days of Axl Rose ripping over some Slash and McKagen guitar/bass."
2,What the Hell?,I have never heard of this band until hearing Bat Country (Which is a GREAT song). So I checked them out. All I can say is that thier earlier sound was WAY better. Seems like another hard thrash band has sold out for the duckies....Shame on You!!!! If I never heard thier earlier albums then I would give this one a better rating.
1,"""these guys are nothing but posers""","I'm sick of hearing people call A7X a metal band. If you are confused at all about just what exactly this band is, let me help you out. This is NOT metal, I dont care if your MTV's Headbangers Ball c.d. says so.this is nothing more than punk rock posers trying to pass themselves off as metal to people who don't know any better. This band is a fraud. if you still like them, go download there music from one of those free sites(although I am not recommending illegal activity, it's just a figure of speech) but this band does not deserve support from anyone who is tricked into believing that this garbage is metal. Bands like this are the ones responsible for the pop/rock wave that is taking over the airwaves. If your going to but music, don't waste your hard earned money on this."
1,Warner Bros Trash,"""I'd swear that Shadows said his vocal chord damage wouldn't affect his voice in any way, but I guess saying that was a mistake.""-hmmm, and i guess its just coincidence that they are not on hopeless anymore?This is major record label trash. For this Album A7X throw the heavy sound, the unique guitar riffs, and the screaming in the trash. All of the guitar riffs (while still pretty crazy) are quite popppy, and extremely predictable. Most guitar solos sound like a new found glory melody on steroids. The drum is par...and the vocals are WEAK. This is no hardcore, this is no metal, this is mainstream rock. And I've come to believe that records like this are population control, because I feel like killing myself when i listen to it.This is not the first band to shame itsself with a crap release, produced by the idiots at warner bros who make them play this kind of garbage...nor, unfortunately, will it be the last."
1,i dont know,"I do have to agree, that it is dumb not to like a band because they are mainstream. That doesn't mean their sound sucks. But I just don't like this cd because it sounds too much like late 80's/early 90's metal. I like Waking the Fallen and Sounding the Seventh Trumpet because I like newer metal, especially like Atreyu, As I Lay Dying, and others. Now I like a lot of different kinds of rock though. My cd's range from Green Day to Norma Jean. And yes, I'm 14."
1,Oh my,Well this shiz sucks. I think avenged sevenfold should join 50 cent Metalica and Merylin Manson in the sucks Genre. I am very sorry for the little children who think their cool because they listen to Avenged Sevenfold. Well your not and if you want to be cool listen to the type of music that you really like and dont just listen to to make friends. Im not dissing on the Hard Rock and Metal Genre. Im just telling everyone that Avenged Sevenfold sucks and has an impressingly low level of talent they can't make real Hard Rock music. If you like Poo then buy this cd if you like real hard rock music then listen to thrice that band has some serious talent.
5,10 out of 10,"This is a great band. Incredible melodies and great musicianship. I really love the fact that this band isn't afraid of the GUITAR!! I was originally afraid that this was some nu-metal, emo, screamo- metal punk band, but I could not be more wrong. This is one incredible band that has blown me away. I hope you get all the credit that you deserve in this very weird music era. I really wish I lived around 10 or 20 years ago. I really think the music you have created is very much the music I love. Thank you very much!!!"
5,Excellent,"Influences from Guns 'n Roses and power metal bands can be heard throughout the album. Awesome melodies and harmonies. Guitarwork is very polished, and the production quality on the album has been much improved over previous work. Every song is perfectly listenable, but with a few gems:-Sidewinder, especially the flamenco solo at the end.-Trashed and Scattered. Very catchy melodies and harmonies.-Strength of the World, 9 minute 'epic'-Beast and the Harlot, perfect way to introduce the album.Of course, there is no album that is perfect for EVERYONE. The vocals are hard for many people to accept (I think they sound fine. Nothing great but at least he isn't Alexi Laiho). This album will NOT please former A7X fans who liked ONLY their screaming from Sounding the Seventh Trumpet. It is not a metalcore album, and it is definitely not a hardcore album (a7x were never hardcore). It's just an awesome piece of metal music. Listen to it if you appreciate good musicianship."
2,Lackluster in Every Sense of the Word,"This album is lackluster in vocals, composition, riffs, and sounds compared to ""Waking the Fallen"". The lead singer being unable to scream severely limits this band and it now tetters on the brink of Skid Row/ Twisted Sister 80's junk. The screaming is gone and replaced by vocal harmonizing. The opening track ""The and the Harlot"" is junk and the album really doesn't have much going on until the 2nd half in which AX7 redeem themselves a little, but overalll this album lacks the thrash metal 80's feel of the last album and feels very commercial and watered down. This must be their ""mainstream/cash in"" album.GRADE: C-"
1,dissapointment,"the first time i had ever herd A7X was chapter four from the madden 04 soundtrack, ever sice then they have ben my favorite band, except when city of evil came out. i thought it was gonna be a great album especialy when i herd bat county, i'm sorry to say but in my eyes that was the only good song on the cd, i miss the old sevenfold, they try to hard to sound like metalica these days when they need to sound more like avenged sevenfold."
3,well...,"The first A7X that I ever heard was their album ""Waking the Fallen,"" and it completely hooked me. Because of Waking the Fallen, to me, A7X is all about the synchronized, catchy, memorable guitar lines and again, the memorable vocals. In particular, I'm thinking about ""I've come here to kill you, won't leave until you die..."" and stuff like that. As far as the guitar goes, the intro to Unholy Confessions is what I'm referring to.So.City of Evil isn't ""bad"" but to me, it isn't really Avenged Sevenfold. No screaming, well, I can get past that, but it seems to lack the overall cohesion that bound Waking the Fallen together. There's just something lacking... nothing wrong with it musically, but in my opinion, it isn't as good as the previous albums."
3,"Not bad, but didn't leave much of an impression.","I only just discovered this band for myself, after hearing Bat Country on the radio. I really liked the uniqueness of their sound and harmonies in that song, but I feel that the rest of the CD does not deviate enough from that formula to stay interesting throughout. There's little doubt that this band has talent, but I question their diversity, even within their own genre of music."
2,Not so great...,"I'm really shocked that every single customer review on this site is so supportive and loving of it. To be honest, I was extremely disappointed and unimpressed with ""Telling Christina Goodbye"". I am an avid, insane reader and I have been known to cry if a book touches me, but this one had no effect on me. It felt like the author was constantly trying to teach me a lesson, and not subtly. The storyline didn't have much depth and you never really know why they are supposed to care so deeply with each other. The characters are unrealistic and did not resonate with me at all. So, I felt that I should put my opinion in to let potential customers know that it might not be as great as these other reviewers think. I truly wish I hadn't wasted five dollars on it."
3,Telling Christina Goodbye,"Lurlene McDaniel is my favorite author, and I love her work. I was a little disapointed with ""Telling Christina Goodbye"" though. I don't think that the idea is original, mainly because I didn't really know the charecters well enough to root for them. I didn't think that this book is as good as most of Lurlene's, although you may feel differently. Even though this book isn't one of my favorites, it is still worth reading.-thanks"
5,Shocking,"This book is a very sad. Christina is a very happy girl. She was happy all the time. One example is that Christina got put down, but she kept her head up. She never felt bad or she blew everything bad that happened over.Christina would never be a girl that was mad or sad. She always was happy. One day she was driving home from the basketball game with her friends and something happened. You should read the book and find out. It is a great book. You should read it. It is very sad. Christina has her very own personality.This is a great book for anyone to read that likes stories about young girls that have trouble in life."
4,Yummy!!!,"The actual product deserves 5 stars, the reason I gave it 4 stars is because its like three dollars at asianfoodgrocer.com. That's where I order it from, not amazon. Much lower prices."
2,"Lacked ""oomph""","I had a really hard time finishing this book.I was looking for a new series to read that was similar to JR Ward, Christina Feehan or Kresley Cole book series. This book just couldn't compare. It's not entirely boring which is why it got 2 stars, but I have no desire to seek out any of Sherrilyn Kenyon's books."
3,It is more like a draft than a serious book,"Books which teach trade-methodology never give you any real result. They will show you some successful examples but never tell you what is the real chance of their systems. So you can learn different kinds of trading systems from those books but you can not do any real comparison for them. I have bought the Sherry's book with the hope that I can learn some analysis for real results. I was dissapointed. It is not difficult to understand the math in the book if you have college degree. However, there is not sufficient discussion on connecting probability/statistic theory to financial market."
3,nice but broken,"This is a very nice looking product. Seems sturdy and doesn't look cheap. Only mine looks broken. Because it is. It was scratched, dropped and otherwise completed manhandled in delivery. It was left on my front door step and the top of the box was literally busted open. I assembled the piece in 30 minutes. That part was easy with the diagramed instructions. The only dissappointing part is once assembled the piece I saw how deep and noticable the gouges and cracks were in the broken pieces of wood. But I didn't want the hassle of sending it back so I used wood filler, wood glue and some semi gloss mahogany stain and doctored it up. It still doesn't look great - or like it should based on photos - but it's functional and it works well in my poorly lit corner of my game room. You can only see the damage in real light - which my dimly lit corner does not have much of. So, the product is nice - just know that it may not make it to you in one piece."
1,STEVE RIZZO IS TO BE BLAMED FOR THE ALKALINE TRIO ATROCITY,"The original ""Fine Without You"" is about 3 million times better than the techno garbage that it was remixed into. Please, if you've got no experience with Alk3, don't judge them based on the song that they for some reason let slip onto this soundtrack. My god. It's as if someone said, ""hey, let's drop this stereotypically boring techno beat behind this song, and speed up the voice track a bit, that'll make it OMG AWESOME""... well, they were wrong. Seek out the Alkaline Trio/One Man Army Split EP if you want to hear the good version of this song, better yet, seek out any Alkaline Trio cd, and you'll find great music. As a matter of fact, bypass this soundtrack altogether, it sucks."
3,Practicing your Patience,"My husband bought the WombSong Prenatal Sound System as soon as we found out I was pregnant. Too Early! Now at 22wks, I still struggle to find my baby's heartbeat. I don't feel too bad about it though because my doctor does too sometimes. (She's a squirmy little one) I love playing her music and talking with her throughout the day. It makes me feel like I'm already incorporating her into our lives. Do be careful about the volume, my baby kicks it if it's too loud. I also love reading stories to her at night. Overall, I think it's better for sharing with baby than it is for hearing the heartbeat."
5,"Excellent product, but with a small complaint","I've one complaint about ""Le Nouveau Petit Robert 2008"" compared to the 2000 edition of ""Le Petit Robert."" The 2000 edition provided exhaustive etymologies for select words (""tre"" and ""clos,"" e.g.), as well as their cognates in various romance languages, but the 2008 edition does not.Also, the font in the 2008 edition is more difficult to read than was the 2000 edition's."
3,Not bad,"The only noticable differences between this and the regular are the sealed comb and the cover, which is opened at the back. It is actually folded like I would fold it myself, so it must be made on the same machine as the normal MB cover. You can seal combs with salad bowl finish, and do a better job too. The extra money might be worth the cumulative hour or two you would spend doing the changes. It does come with screws instead of pins, which a lot of people like more for maintenance, though screws will eventually loose their threading. It will really be nice when these are in stores though and you can get some of the benefit of a custom harmonica for a gig later that day or something.About overblows: I was able to get an overblow on the 4th hole out of the box, though not a great one. It's better but it's not a custom instrument. You really want one that's re-gapped or embossed."
5,Day of the Iguana,"Day of the Iguana was a great book, because it makes you want to read on.It's about a boy named Hank, he and his friends Franky and Ashley do a magicshow called Magic 5. Hank's cousins are having a birthday party and their momhired Hank to do a show. When they got there Franky reminds Hank to tape the monster movie. Unfortonaly Hank couldn't figure out how to tape it. Then Hank's sister Emily loses her pet Iguana. If you want to find out what happens to Hank Zipzer, you'll have to read the book yourself."
2,Broke after 10 or so uses,"I've had this product for a couple of years but don't use it very often. The last time I did, the opener no longer worked. The screw goes into the cork just fine but wont pull it out. Taking it apart and making sure the pieces fit together properly hasn't helped. And now I discover that there isn't anyway to get help with the product since Scunci was sold to Conair and only seems to manufacture hair products now."
2,Obsolescent Books for Sale,"This book is the third edition, which has been superceded by the fourth edition which is for sale on Amazon.com. The material in the books is similar, as is the teaching format; the material is up-to-date. Price, alone, might recommend buying the third edition."
5,This is a great CD. All the songs are are great like him.,"Hi my name is Maribel and I'm from L.A. CA. I really think that this CD like the others is great. I love his music and him. I have beed his biggest fan since I was a little girl. I was like around 5 years old when I used to say that he was my boyfriend and now I'm 19 and I still keep thinking that he is my boyfriend. The songs that I like the most from this CD are Mi Forma de Sentir, Vamos a Platicar, Puras Mentiras, and El dinero no es la Vida. I really recomend everyone to get it."
3,"Please define ""LargePrint""","I'm certainly not too happy with this purchase. I do like the NKJV, however, to sell this Bible as a large print edition is a stretch of biblical proportion. I can barely read it for 10 minutes without eyestrain. I will keep it for gifting to someone else who has stronger vision. In Amazon's defense the bible is clearly marked large print from the mfgr. I would estimate the font size at around 8-9."
1,Huge Waste Of Money,"I am writing about the KINDLE EDITION only. It has no index, no links to click on for the Master Outlines. The only thing this is good for on a kindle is simply to read and one has to do that in order, page by page as there is no way to access a favorite book or a verse. Huge disappointment. For this particular bible it is better to just buy the hard copy."
1,Not Worth My Time,"I need a toothbrush that works quickly, not in months but weeks/days. The people who make these products don't understand the meaning of FAST! It's not worth my time if it doesn't work effectively or efficiantly like i want it to. Call me stuborn but there are many people who feel this way to!"
1,Milking it!,Top quality songs but a total rip-off. This has all been issued and re-issued in numerous and superior formats. Only buy if you have money to burn!
2,Seemed like a good idea at the time....,"Let's see: I've bought Get Happy literally more times than I can count--on CBS vinyl, on CBS cassette, on CBS CD, on Ryko CD, on Rhino CD....seriously: enough is enough. It's not about the packaging. It's about the music. Ironincally, ""High Fidelity"" was never the point of listening to Elvis. The songs are great, but this set is redundant and sub-par unless you have nothing, in which case, I'd say, go to eBay and but the Rhino stuff used."
4,This book became a movie,"I read this good fiction book, here in Brazil.This book uses real facts , during World War II, as its source.The operation wanted to decieve nazi Germany, during the months before and some months after D Day landings, in 1944.This book really is a good fiction, but today , I don't like to read fiction.When I read this book, more than twenty years ago, I liked it.Because of the fact that I enjoyed this book, I must give four stars for it."
3,Entertaining,"I recently read Folletts first two books of his Century trilogy so I thought I'd try this. Ken Follett is a good story teller. The books aren't deep but they are entertaining page turners. If you seek entertainment, the book is excellent."
3,Good read but thin characterizations,"Good read, descriptive but thin on major character development, not among his best works. Interesting for a weekend, but if you are not into spy novels, move on."
2,Eye of the Needle,I found this story a little hard to get into. It wasn't a story that I found captivating unlike other stories I have read from this author.
4,A good story,"A good story - but don't think too much about it as you'll spot the holes and the ending.Well written, it draws you in. If this was his first novel I will definitely go on to read more by this author. But not a five star read."
5,Aptly Titled,"I do not want to reveal any plot points, but I can only say that the TITLE of this book is more chilling than you know. An excellent read. I am a voracious reader who enjoys Norman Mailer, Gore Vidal, Leon Uris, Colleen McCullough, Stephen King, Maeve Binchy, Olivia Goldsmith, Anne Tyler and many more, but Ken Follett is by far my favorite. He turns a phrase with a perfection that can be seen not only here but in The Man from St. Petersburg, Night over Water, and Pillars of the Earth. I highly recommend them all. The suspense in The Eye of the Needle does not stop until you put the book down, which you will not do until you have finished it. Enjoy"
4,Another winner from Follett,"I read this book years ago. I liked it so much I bought it for my Kindle, for a friend. ( we exchange Kindles when we are in Fl.) I rarely read a book a second time, but I reread this one. If you like a thriller story and WW2 history, this book is for you."
3,Eye of the Needle,"This is a fantastic read which tends to show the versatility of Follet as he deals with a German spy and his relationship with a very resourceful English lady. ""Eye of the Needle"" is completely believable, and as more current data is released and exposes some of the clandestine activities conducted during WWII, one can come to believe almost anything is and was possible.Follet's talented writing, character and situation development, holds you. It is truely a page turner you don't want to put down.E.J.Walden, author ""Operation Snow Owl"""
2,Way too Sidney Sheldonish for my taste,This book sucked. That is the best way to put it. The only reason I did not gave 2 stars is because there is another book that sucks even more (Fireflies in december) but I digress. The characters are quite plain and cliché. They also seem to suffer from multiple personality disorder because they change considerably and almost magically from who they were in the beginning and who they were in the end.When I was a teenager I loved reading Sidney Sheldon's book. Everybody was gorgeous and brave and fabulous and had great sex and the stories could be made in to a soap opera thanks to the absurd twists and turns of destiny. Those kind of books were enjoyable for me then but not anymore. My point is that if I read the eye of the needle when I was 16 I would have probably like it quite a bit.
4,Very enlightening,"I found it interesting as I was a child at the time, remember people talking about not talking, so those years come to life for me."
5,A one,"Ken Follett is one of the greatest writers of our time. ""Eye of the Needle"" is one of those books you can't put down and don't want to end."
3,Good bedtime reading but nothing exceptional,It was a good read but I do not think that this book will get into golden collection of literature. The problem is that I new in the middle of the book how it all ends and there was no twist really. Too simple in my opinion. Definitely not a 5 star book.
4,"Spy catchers in the 1940,s","The eye of the needle kept me riveted to my kindle, how they caught spies in the 1940's was intriguing without all our present day gadgets and methods of communication...good read"
3,Good read. A bit predictable but good.,Follett does a good job with historical accuracy of events outlined in his books. His characters are well built and believable.
5,Great Book,"Good read...a real page turner. I am rarely dissappointed with this writer. I recall that this book was made into a movie, but the book was much better."
5,Rivetting,"From first page to last, Follett has more twists and turns that switchbacks on a mountain. I felt like I was on the sidelines watching the story unfold. I bought his Pillars of the Earth hoping it would be similar but it is way too many pages for my patience. This one was just enough to keep me hooked."
3,good... needs improvement in speed,"It's definitely an improvement on MacOS 10.0, which was really a beta. I have been using it for 6 months, and have been overall impressed with its stability. Speed and usability are two areas that need improvement. Go for 10.2 Jaguar..."
5,BIG improvement and some great features!!,"WOW! Applications are interacting much more smoothly, and my computer is definately faster. Even my internet has improved! I had also, in the past, been unable to upload JPEG's to the internet with Appleworks, and now it's no problem at all! The mail system is generally more sensible (I have 2 accounts on it, both with different servers). MacOSX features a cute toolbar with icons that bounce when something happens (like getting an alert message, or an instant message on AIM); the icons sort of roll out when you scroll over them (very silly and cute, but it doesn't get in the way). With internet, I can ""hide"" a page, and a thumbnail of the website appears on the toolbar! iTunes is also great. I can finally download MP3's and share music! Some things are basically the same, and there's a lot more ""flash"" than previous verisons, but i would definately recommend MacOSX!!! A+!!!"
1,False Advertising.,"Got a new 3D TV so I'm looking for some good 3D titles to add to my collection. This title sounded like a safe bet. When I received my movie, the first thing I noticed on the cover was that this is a 2D version of the 3D theatrical release. I'm sure Mr. Chesney put on a good show, but I haven't bothered watching it yet. Nice waste of money when you don't get what you order."
1,bad,This didn't work for my daughter.She tried many times and had the same results every time.maybe it was just a bad bottle
1,Profound Influence,"This book had profound influence on the NeoCons even though its ""evidence"" is based on blowback--CIA disinformation that ""blew back"" to the US--designed to discredit the Soviet Union. The miltary calls this phenomenon ""Incestuous Amplification."" This means believing your own propaganda. Check out the video ""The Neocons"" (Also called ""The Power of Nightmares"")The Power of Nightmares by Adam Curtiswhich can be found on you tube and see how the jihadists and the NeoCons share the same intellectual origins and how this book played a role in that vision, particularly Casey's decision to fund Islamic ""Freedoms Fighters"" in Afghanistan establishing the militant foundation for the 9-11 attacks on the New York World Trade Center. Also learn why these same NeoCons decided to attack Iraq. You will not find the answers in this book, only the Incestuous Amplification. This is a book full of CIA initiated lies that the CIA has discredited as it own (false) propaganda."
4,Compelling Arrangements,"Two cds pack in the music, with new versions of instrumental and jazz standards providing the compelling arrangements equally applicable to a dinner club, casual listener or avid jazz fan venue alike."
4,"Really works, but replacement costs...","The effectiveness of the Sonicare PS-1 is most easily explained by just using it. First impression is that it's quite a strong device. But after getting used to it, it's a cinch.Because it's so powerful, after brushing you feel like you left the dentist's office. I don't doubt the claims of other ppl that this is a great toothbrush. But, I realized after the fact that replacing the brush heads are an expensive proposition, as compared to the competition. Even though the brush heads are recommended to be replaced every 6 months, the replacement costs are still rather high."
3,great while it lasted,"When we all first began using the sonicare toothbrush, we laughed because it tickled so much. We all just loved it. Our teeth and mouths felt so clean. Then one morning, no sonic, no nothing. Just stopped working. I was very disappointed that it lasted a mere 6 months. Now we are back to the old fashioned manual toothbrush."
3,"Cleans well, short battery life","Cleans well and is highly recommended by my dentist. Brush heads also last longer than the suggested 6-month replacement frequency. However, don't expect to use the handpiece longer than 2 years (the warranty period). It uses old-fashioned NiCad batteries that are sealed in and cannot be replaced, and I'm still waiting for Sonicare or Braun to come out with a model that uses the newer, more robust, longer-lasting rechargeable batteries."
1,It didn't work!,When I received this item it didn't work and I had to return it. I am awaiting a replacement.
4,Good Delius performance.,"This is a good way to know Delius Piano Concerto. Finzí`sEclogue is also a very interesting work and this performance isvery representative. For RVW Piano Concerto, you'll find a muchbetter option, perhaps the best, in Howard Shelley version withthe same conductor. Good option to get the Delius concerto."
4,What Fates Warning should be doing,"I am a huge FW fan and I think w. the direction their last few albums have been I would of preferred to hear something like this instead of FWX. Not that FWX was bad but this seems to at least have some steam where FW seem to be stripping things down rather than the dizzying complexity. Sorry to rant on the FW kick but these guys are very parallel (no pun intended) to the Fates sound. Cool medoldic prog metal w/ high pitched vox, lyrics about emotions and interesting time changes and moods."
4,Progressive metal at its finest,"The Good""The Suffocating Silence"" is far from silent. Blood-thirsty guitar riffs, thunderous drums, and thumping bass lead the charge on the tracks momentous introduction. A fitting opening track I must say. The vocals glow with vibrant melodies and texture. ""Bleed Me Dry"" has a more subdued and darker tone to it. Be sure to listen to the intricacies of the guitar melody lines. Rapid-fire drum patterns, powerful vocals, and meaty riffs tear down the walls on ""The Death of Faith and Reason."" ""Memory"" is a progressive metal fans wet dream. It clocks in at over nine minutes, it's heavy on the keyboard tones, and it has tempo changes a-plenty. ""Blind My Eyes"" focuses on the enduring and emotional vocals of Ray Alder. ""Used to Be"" is a balls-to-the-wall metal onslaught.The BadNothing notableThe VerdictProgressive metal at its finest."
4,Origins of Ruin,"I had never heard of these guys before I saw them open up for Dream Theater last night at U.B. I was VERY impressed with their live show, and during intermission went out and bought this CD. Not at all disappointed. If you are a Dream Theater fan, you'd love these guys. I would have to say that James Labrie does have a stronger voice with larger range than Ray Alder, but overall this is an incredible CD, well worth the money spent."
5,The perfect place for newcomers to start,"Create something new in a modern style with this collection of craft project selections, Super Crafty: Over 75 Amazing How-to Projects. Do-it-yourself projects range from sewing and knitting to gluing: Super Crafty is the perfect place for newcomers to start, telling how to use recycled and re-purposed crafts to produce simple fun items from pet collars and luggage tags to magnets."
3,not as many ideas as i hoped,"was looking for a little more ""high-end"" craft/gift ideas, but will likely put this to good use with my niece instead."
1,Should be called SUPER CRAPPY,"I checked this book out of my local library and was appalled at how tacky the bulk of the projects are. This seems to be an imitation of the popular Stitch N Bitch series (though the focus here is all sorts of crafts, not just knitting), and a poor one at that. Whereas the SNB books feature designs that are innovative, beautiful, and sophisticated, Super Crafty is filled with projects that lack any real purpose and look just cheap and silly.This book seems to be aimed at adults, however I don't think anyone over twelve would be caught dead having most of these items lying around the house."
4,The First Part Last,"The First Part Last, by Angela Johnson!I would give this book 4 stars. Its about a 16 year old urban boy by the name of Bobby, who is suddenly a single parent after the death of his baby mother Nia! Bobby then faces a hard choice of either giving his new baby (Feather) up for adoption or taking on the responibility of being a father to young Feather. Overall this book is great, I just wish it was longer! I read this 131 page book in about 2 1/2 hours! Trust me this book is worth buying!!Best of Luck with The first Part Last! And I hope I have helped you! (...)"
3,Decent Book,"The first thing I liked about this book, is the way the author would use a ""then and now"" sequence. Although it was confusing at times, it was different to other books. The book, although interesting - didn't really make me feel like ""yeah, I have to suggest this book to others"". It didn't have that ""umph"". With that being said, the book is realistic, so you actually do feel some emotions when reading it but I just didn't feel it was that great."
3,Good,The First Part Last was a great book to read.The book goes back and forth between in the past and now and in the present. Also it is a good book for teens to relate to on not having a baby in their future and when they're not too young. I also like this book because it shows not to make mistakes in your future and not to mess up your life with another person who doesn't know what they're doing.
5,Very touching book,This book is easy to read; but I feel it is hard to not keep thinking of it after done reading!
3,The theme,"The theme throughout the whole book, Cabin on Trouble Creek, is ""Be very cautious when you don't have your parents there to help you. First, Will and Danial learned that they should be very cautious about what they do around a bear. When Will and Danial went to go fish, a bear chased them because it wanted the tasty fish. Second, Will and Danial learned that they need to be prepared for everything, even a huge winter. Third, Will and Danial learned that they shouldn't go away from their house to collect nuts. Will and Danial went to collect nuts and they got lost for a whole day! Fourth, Will and Danial learned that they should not try to attack a bear. Will was up in a tree and a bear was about to attack him and then Danial tried to attack the bear but it attacked him and clawed his leg. Now you should be that cautious, and none of that stuff should happen to you."
2,Actually..... 2 1/2 Stars.......,"I didn't buy this movie expecting a horror movie. After all, it's rated PG-13 and I wouldn't call it a creepy thriller either as it has been called. It was just ok for me. Maybe a tiny bit of suspense but not a edge of your seat kind of movie. I would say it's a Fatal Attraction wanna be with the plot involving a girl who becomes obsessed with a man..... well in this case both of them are students. After a one night stand, the girl becomes obsessed with this guy and before long, she will do whatever it takes to make him hers even though he has a girlfriend. She resorts to anything she can think of..... even murder. Good movie to watch if you are not into the horror movies but there are much better ""thrillers"" out there."
4,"A MODEREN VERSION OF THE CRUSH,BUT BETTER","SWIM FAN GETS 3.5 OUT OF 5.Meet Ben a high schooler with everything going for him: Looks,a good looking girl,a lot of freinds,a good job and a very good chance of winning a swimming scholar ship too a CL.unversity.But his story book life is about too change when he meets Madison:and a swimming lesson: Becomes more, then a swimmming lesson.Ben wants this too be a one time thing,too him it was a mistake,but too Madison well ""I love you"".Is forever:if she can't have him no one can.First comes the stalking.then his best freind is found dead in the school pool.The girl he loves ran off the road.With a shady past Ben is number one suspect & unless he can prove his innocences his life will never be the same."
2,Havent we seen this before?,"You know, i really really wanted to walk away liking this movie. Even throughout all the predictable and semi-implausable scenes i still hoped for the best. Well, i cant say it was a terrible movie, i have seen worse. The problem with this movie is that it isnt very original, and that makes it flounder and die when compared to other movies with similar themes, like the great Fatal Attraction, or Clint Eastwood's Play Misty for me. If taken as a stand alone movie and ignoring its much better predecessors, it can be good. When compared....it cant stack up."
3,See it for Erika,"This is a standard-issue stalker thriller (modeled on ""Fatal Attraction""). After 15 minutes you'll pretty much figure out what's going to happen. But maybe you'll keep watching because of Erika Christensen's turn as the obsessed Madison Bell. With her glittering blue eyes she's believable as a stalker. She could have just showed up, taken the money, and gone home, but she actually tried to earn her salary, for which we can be grateful.The film just zips along. The film makers know that you know how it goes, and don't waste much time with explanations and expositions. They whole thing is ""by the numbers""; at several points along the way they had a chance to really surprise the audience, but they didn't."
4,Closer to 3.5 stars........,"This movie wasn't too scary..... just a bit creepy. People are saying it is the teen version of Fatal Attraction, but I've never seen Fatal Attraction. This movie is definetly worth seeing. It is a little slow moving in my opinion, but I thought Signs was slow moving and my friends totally disagreed. I'm not positive if it is worth owning. I bought it, but this isn't one of those movies that all types of people would enjoy or that is for all ages. So you should just give it a try and rent it and decide for yourself."
2,"The Crush, Part 2","Well, as many of the reviews have stated, this film comes from the Fatal-Attraction-Teen-Crush ""If I Can't Have You, Then You Better Watch Your Back"" school of filmaking. Some of the scenes are pretty rediculous because we know that this girl, who is obsessed with this guy, is going to do all she can to send a message and ruin this guy's life. So, once he tells her to leave him alone, you pretty much know what is going to happen. She starts stalking him, leaving a ton of messages on his computer, getting him in trouble with his girlfriend, hurting people close to him, etc.It's not a terrible movie per se, but I feel as though I've seen it a hundred times. I think it would have been better if they had taken this movie a different direction. I would write a longer review, but in a few years this movie will be long forgotten about, so what's the point."
3,Funny book,Kids will love to read the many short stories of the adventures (or should I say misadventures) of Herbert. These happy stories can be shared at bedtime.
4,positive reading,I really loved this book because I am in the startup phase of my company and there is lots of common sense reading in the book to help you know that you can succeed also.
2,"Okay, But Not Really Helpful","Barbara's advice is just not doable for the average person in business today. Her examples about her mother's advice are just not relevant. I have not been able to finish this book because it is so boring and she pats herself on the back all through the book. Good for her for making a killing in real estate back when you could do that. We see what happened to many of these real estate sharks in recent years. Not impressed with the money, money, money! She pulled off her sales using deceptive practices, in my opinion. Sorry I helped increase her coffers by purchasing this book."
1,"Disappointing, almost contrived",I was disappointed. I had anticipated something more realistic and isntructional. It appeared that the author had objectives and then created a history that fit that outcome. The title made no sense and was intended to market the book. Then the topics discussed in the book were too unrealistic to be credible. The author's liberal values and agenda were patently obvious and should have had no place in this book. I was disappointed.
4,"Hot Stuff, Comin' Though","I really like Lodge items. I cook a lot in the kitchen and outdoors. I own many pieces of Lodge cast-iron cookware. The striped hot handle holders make it very easy to take hot iron skillets from oven to the table. I like them because my kids can use them too when we are camping by the fire, no burning of their little hands. All around great product."
4,"Keeps your fingers from burning, remove when cooking.","I've enjoyed using these for years but quickly realized that I need to remove them when my pans are on an open flame. I'm not sure if it's the flame creeping up the sides of the pots, or simply the temps that I cook with, but the mitts will start to brown at the edges closest to the pot if you leave them on when cooking. It's a mild annoyance to remove them, but the option is they will brown and no longer look as nice when in use.I have a few pans that are copies, not actual Lodge designed and these fit on those just fine too. There might be some oddball handles but all of the cast iron pans I have work with these.4 stars, due to the fact that they brown so easily, I can only give them 4 stars. I like them but expected more."
4,as expected,The hot handles were what i wanted and were as advertised. They came in a timely manner to my home.
2,Lit on fire quickly!,Mitt has caught on fire twice! Should not keep these on while cooking- especially if unattended even briefly. Would recommend a nonflammable product- perhaps the silicone handle.
3,"Good fit, decent value, should be more heat resistant","These look nice, and fit the pan handles well, but if you leave them on the pan for any length of time (and not a crazy hot pan either... 350-375 in the center of the pan is enough) they will get charred on the pan end. There is aLodge Max Temp Handle Mitt, Blackthat might work better but I don't have any experience with it as I ordered these instead. They could definitely be made out of some material that held up better to high temps. I would expect that kind of problem at 500+ degrees, but I don't consider 350 degrees (probably less than 300 where the handle meets the pan) to be particularly hot for cast iron cookware."
4,Mit Goot.,The mitts were as expected and work fine. Hard to write anything exciting about mit's.They do fit nicely though!
3,Look cute - but silicone is better,"I use these on my cast iron pans. I do like their cute appearance, but I think the silicone style are easier to keep clean and to clean when they get dirty."
4,a pan like grandma's,"This pan is like the one my grandma use to use when she would cook sunday dinner for the family..cooks very well but has one lacking flaw that gave it 4 instead of 5 stars..sharp rim edge. For a made in the u.s. product frankly i expected better. You can't tell me that the manufacturer could not have takes 30 more seconds to round the edges of pan so it would not be sharp..come on now. Overall a good pan but watch those edges...this pan will only fit the 10""x6"" inch rack."
3,Not as Sturdy as Mom's Was,"This is nowhere near as sturdy as the old one I use every year for my turkey, but it will do for a small chicken. I don't think it will last for years, like the ones my mother and grandmother used. I wouldn't mind paying several dollars more if I thought it would be a ""forever"" purchase.This roaster is smaller than I envisioned. The ""13 inches"" refers to the outside dimensions: from the outside edge of one handle to the outside edge of the other. Its inside length is 11 inches. WARNING: the ""Frequently bought with"" Harold Import 12-by-8 and 1/4-inch Oval Roasting Rack does not fit this roaster! They should not be advertised together."
5,best roasting pan,"I had this exact roasting pan for 20 years,finally it started dripping on the bottom.I looked all over for the exact same pan,and by accident while buying something else on amazon i saw it.I ordered it as fast as i could.I have used it about a week after i got it,same as my old one.Now my old pan is in the garbage.Hope this lasts as long as the other.Very happy with this product,thought i wouldn't find another."
3,Needs a better cover,The roasting pan is okay but I find that the cover does not fit nicely on it. It should be a tight fit but it isn't. When I move the pan from the counter to the oven - the cover starts to move off.
2,Granite Ware 13 Inch Covered Oval Roaster,"Small amount of damage to roaster, but I never filed a formal complaint. So, I don't know if they would of refunded my money. The damage was to the handels, so the roaster is still usable. The product came to my house in a very timely manner."
5,Roasting Pan,This a great item.It is just big enough to cook for two people. It roasts meat wonderfully. I had one but it was damaged. I have been looking for years in all the stores with no luck. Then I found this on Amazon. Thanks Amazon.
5,"Best value, arrives quickly","I was surprised at how quickly this item arrived. The box did not seem like it could hold 18 inches, but cleverly, the roaster was catty-corner in the box and fit just fine! This was purchased for my daughter, who had thoroughly researched roasters, and I was pleased to see that she found it to be highly rated for its utility as well as its price, since I have been using one myself for years."
2,Broken handle,"The 15"" roaster arrived with one broken handle. Returned for an exchange - no hassle from Amazon at all. Hope this is not a weak point in the product manufacturing or design. The 13"" roaster is a much better design - the handles are integral part of the pan and not welded on like the larger ones."
4,Yet Another Compilation...,"This CD includes tracks from THE CLOWN, WHITE SKY, IN THE SKIES, LITTLE DREAMER, WHATCHA GONNA DO, KOLORS, LEGEND and more. Like most compilations, we all can disagree which songs should be here that aren't and vice versa. Recommended for those who wish to sample Peter Green's gorgeous subtle blues-rock phrasing without purchasing the entire catalog. The ""set"" is a seamless relaxed array of mostly slow tempo cuts. Good night music."
5,Bigger Than Christmas,"A humorous and poignant Christmas story with hints of It's a Wonderful Life and Back to the Future. Jim is charming and a bit buffoonish; Molly will break your heart as she subtely steals it; and Galen is the kind uncle who drives a DeLorean, wears Zoot suits and gently steers the ship of life. 1225 Mistletoe Lane is, if possible, bigger and better than Christmas."
4,1225 Mistletoe Lane,"1225 Mistletoe Lane is definiantly a feel good story.I found myself smiling throughout the book.Jim (the main character) is a very sad individual in that he has no hope, no joy, and no faith, until a special friend Galen, helps him find these things that makes life special.Lenny Castellaneta has written a book that is easy to read and worth reading again. You can easily pick up the emotions of the characters and feel their joy, their laughter, and their sadness. They ending will have you smiling and saying life is good."
4,This is just plain COOL!,"I have this item and it is just what I have been waiting for. You can record your favorite songs and bring them with you anywheres. You don't have to search the radio, or where earphones any more. I say get this while they are in stock!"
1,"CD ""Prince Igor the Rapsody"" FEAT. Warren G & Sissel. It is awful.","CD ""Prince Igor the Rapsody"" FEAT. Warren G & Sissel.I did not know Warren G is a rapper! Rap and the best sorano in the wrold do not go together at all! Sissel is great, but the CD is runed by the rap ""music"". Further, the rap is parental discretion--the words are awful! It is so bad I will probably just throw it away!"
2,Not that impressed...,"I have to say, I'm not as impressed as the other reviewers with Tenderly. I'd tried Urad, which I was impressed with (despite the weird pine-needle smell), and I thought perhaps Tenderly would work much better than other typical leather conditioners. Alas, this seems to work pretty much just as well as any other leather conditioner that costs a lot less. You still have to use multiple applications to really soften the leather, and while it isn't particularly greasy, it isn't grease-less, it still leaves some residue. If it wasn't $15, I'd give it 3 stars, but at $15 for a little tub, I'd say this is a rip-off. Just buy some cheaper leather lotion from your local leather shop."
5,Eye Opening Book,"Prior to reading this book, I didn't consider that I was an abused child. Dr. Whitfield explores all forms of abuse with the reader. I considered my family Dysfunctional, but not to the extent of abuse. I now realize that emotional abuse is as real as physical abuse and can deal with it and get on with a more emotionally healthy life. Dr. Whitfield does a marvelous job assisting the reader in discovering their pain and themselves. Thank you Dr. Whitfield, I can now stop making excuses for my parents, deal with my pain, forgive my parents, heal, and discover my child within."
4,"I like it, but...","A fundamental introduction to the unabashedly exploratory nature of this music can be found by listening to Fleetwood Mac's goodbye London concert at the Roundhouse Chalk Farm on April 24, 1970. Go to Wolfgang's Vault dot com and listen to the entire concert. It's very revealing.I'll always take my hat off to Peter Green. 'A Love That Burns'."
4,Like Boz - - Love the band,"This is a nice effort by Boz to sing music he oviously has great affection and reverence for. Not bad for a first try at standards and hopefully he'll get more comfortable in his own skin if he tries a second shot at the standard repertoire.If you like the back up band on this CD (Paul Nagel, Eric Crystal, John Shiflett and Jason Lewis) go and buy ""Left Coast Life"" by Kitty Margolis. These guys recorded with her long before Boz hired them and on Kitty's CD they really PLAY. Kitty's bright, sexy singing lights a slow burn fire under the exact sameband and to tell the truth they sound quite a bit more inspired on her date.I like Boz better doing his own originals and R & B. Still, this is one of the better of the ""middle aged popster takes a stab at jazz"" releases that have come down the pike."
5,"Art C , Hoouston, Texas","I first heard this album on the local TSU jazz station. I have not been a fan of his music, I am now. His interpretations and superb side men make this album one I listen to time and time again.The recording is excellent, a cut above the average CD. I use a high end system that immediately separates the good recording from the average.I have listened to this album many times and never tire of it. As I listen each time I hear something different.I hope he comes out with another one soon."
2,Tedious and even irritating at times,"Boz Scaggs has a great voice but I don't think his talents are best showcased in this genre. I find this recording tedious and even irritating at times. The arrangements at times accentuate the worst in his sidemen---shrill saxaphone, no space in the drumming, languid piano---and Mr. Scaggs does not sound like he is really enjoying himself.It's not to compare this session with the high energy of an outfit like the Riff Burglars fronted by the outstanding Roger Chapman. I'll take the Riff Burglars any day."
2,Kill the Drums!,"I agree with the other reviewer - the drums are used as a metronome - to the extent that it DOES interfere with Scaggs' soulful, well balanced vocals. I must say it made this CD a miss with me, not the hit it could have been."
1,Worst piece of junk of all time! Do not buy!,"Where should I begin... The input level on the microphone is so low, the software wouldn't even pick it up. As a handheld recorder, the playback in unrecognizable. I thought this would be a great gift for my daughter...no chance. It doesn't even work as a standard microphone for the computer..."
1,Don't waste your time.,"Does anyone take Chomsky seriously? This book is worthless. By the way, Chomsky's remarks about the Holocaust denial book were not ""misconstrued,"" and to my knowledge, he has never repudiated them. In fact, on the subject of the reality of the Holocaust (perhaps the most heavily documented historical event ever to take place), he declared himself ""an agnostic."" Why should anyone listen to a person who would say such a thing?"
4,Quite good ambient/techno,"Grid is one of the better b-rated artists of this genre, but their music still has to go one step further to reach the likes of Fluke or Tangerine Dream. Keep your eye on Grid in the future."
3,I WISH THERE WOULD BE MORE VIDEOS!,"Sam is great in this video, and we can see her more as what she's like in everyday life.I have her VHS ""Greatest Hits Videos"" and i hope that one day there will be a DVD with every video she ever made."
5,Love the Labyrinth,This is a beautiful tool (not JUST a coffee table book!) and a great gift for those who already use the labyrinth as well as one who has yet to explore it's possibilities. I highly recommend Way of the Winding Path! Thoughtful text and beautiful photos.
5,Five Stars for the Brooklyn Prodigy,"My Name Is Asher Lev by Chaim Potok is a remarkable story from the first page to the last. Potok takes the reader on a captivating journey through the complex mind and painful life of the ""Brooklyn Prodigy"" while dealing with reoccurring questions concerning acceptance, forgiveness, and the struggle to face one's identity. Potok creates a unique cast of characters and forms powerful relationships between them. No relationship, however, is as powerful as the one that Asher forms with his passion for painting. Through his passion, Asher and his family experience torment, anguish, confusion, and heartbreak. Their hardships, however, prove to teach life altering lessons about truth and love. Potok's use of vivid language and imagery help the reader to experience, feel, and learn as the characters do. This thought provoking novel had a great impact on me and is by far one of the best novels I have ever read."
1,Slow moving unsatisfying reading,"This book plodded along like it was trying to escape from literary quicksand. Even though there was some interesting insight into the Hasidic lifestyle, story was stale and boring..... page after page of the same frustration and sadness. I kept waiting for 'the next page' to get better.... it didn't. After reading positive reviews before purchasing it, I was very disappointed and would not recommend this book to anyone."
4,"An ""almost new"" used hardcover.","This review is more for the Enright afficianado and so concerns only the physical condition of the book. (The writing was as good as I remembered it to be.) The hardcover was created in 2002 so it's not quite as sturdy as they made them in the good old days, but it is sturdy enough. The book looked almost new, which considering the price, is excellent. This edition had Enright's illustrations, thank goodness, which I was worried about when I first saw the outside cover, which artwork I did not particularly like. Great price for a hardcover, and Armadillo books shipped very quickly."
5,Should be Read on Sunday Through Friday,This lovely book is just as I remembered it -- light and easy reading for all ages.
1,Regarding the work of Emily Post,"Unintentionally hilarious. Were she alive today, Emily Post would consider this unabashedly straightforward review to be quite the faux pas..."
5,Love this book as a Mother of 8,"I love this book. It is the best resource for a mother of 8 who really wants to raise children who are schooled in etiquette. My son loves to read it to us while we travel in the car. Although we live in rural ND, the kids are ready to be polite and current on etiquette everywhere we go. I cannot tell you the amount of compliments my children have gotten in elevators, restaurants, theme parks, etc. since we started going through the rules of etiquette. It is fabulous. Every parent should use it for themselves and their families to make a friendlier world."
4,refine your excellence with some ETIQUETTE,Educating your kids or yourself? Most of us can still learn a lot. Many basic things are so obvious but forgotten or not applied. Give it a try and earn more respect.Learn how to invite people for a party and how and when to reply. How should you react if someone stole your sandwich from the company fridge?Business lunches or a romantic date? What to do and what NOT to do?One small remark : Europeans always keep both fork & knife in hand and NEVER hide one hand under the table so they can continue to eat the pre-cut food! This is even considered very rude.
4,Simple and functional,"Remarkably simple but functional. It was usable as soon as it is pulled out of the box, there is no need for assemblage. It does exactly what it has been designed to do at a reasonable price. You do need to anchor it to a wall for optimal stability."
2,flimsy,"this looks much better in the picture, sure it does hold the bottles of wine, but it is shaky, the installation my be done exactly, bottles are very close together and I can see dropping a bottle on trying to reach through. Not impressed. No instructions on how to put it together, requires the unit to be attached to the wall with the included 4 screws for stability or the whole thing will fall apart. (product description makes it sound like it is options, but will fall apart if not installed properly.."
2,A little disappointed,"This rack was smaller than I pictured, and somewhat rickety. I will use it, but if I'd seen it in a store, I would have passed right by it."
2,Wine Rack,We are very disappointed in the wine rack we purchased. It seems to have been put together backwards. The lower side of the rack is against the wall. The bottles slope backward. This is not the way wine bottles are to be stored.
4,A Good Step In The Right Direction,"The Christian church in America is just starting to wake up to the need of ministering to men. Started by Promise Keepers and eventually led by John Eldredge and David Murrow, the movement has had its fits and starts, its moments of excess, and the occasional bad exegesis, but nobody can deny that the masculine heart of the Church is in serious trouble.Paul Coughlin has now stepped up to the plate and offered us his viewpoint and though it is not perfect and though there are some points that seem rather outré, he does the Christian church a good service in making us face what we have done: allowed the culture and zeitgeist of our era affect the Body of Christ instead of allowing the Church to affect the culture.The Christian church needs men who understand the roles that God has called them to, the roles of a righteous king, a godly warrior, a Christ-centered priest, and a holy lover. Coughlin is a good step in the right direction."
1,Expensive and useless,"I could not have been more exited when this technological marvel arrived. The first thing that I noticed was that the watch is extremely lightweight. I question whether the watch could take the punishment usually associated with trail running. Since I sent the system back, I will never know. Upon hitting the track,(a 3 mile loop), the GPS system never functioned despite all outward indications of working properly. The heart monitor would lose signals for moments at at time. Before my next run, I sat down and went through the instructions again to make sure I was not doing anything wrong. I took the system out for a second and third run and had the same results. I shipped it back and went back to running my trusty Suunto Altimax."
2,Disappointing,"This was disappointing reading for me--after a rather abstruse (but perhaps technically useful to some) delineation of various factors involved in analyzing ""state building,"" the application to any real situations was extremely thin and nothing new. Nor was much ""meat"" put on the skeleton. It reminded me of university situations where publishing periodically is a necessity. (However, the subject area is only an interest of mine--my Ph.D. is in a different field.)"
1,Jam It in the trash can,"If zero stars were an option, the Jam It would truly deserve them. The negative reviews are true. Don't waste your time or money on this."
4,Nice Jacket,"Seems like a good jacket for the money. Check back in 10 years, I'll tell you how is stands up to use."
3,SQL Server for Windows XP,"SQL Server does work for Windows XP (Home), contrary to another review. I never was able to get the default Windows authentication mode to work. I needed to use mixed mode instead. This is an irritating requirement, but works fine otherwise."
4,Great content.,Great content. Well chosen affirmations and relaxing music. The voice of the woman who speaks is not very appealing but it's not distracting.
2,Not for fertility but infertility,"So I bought Belleruth Naparsteck: If you are TTC and suffer form infertility you don't want to be reminded of this and you don't want to give up just yet. I didn't like it at all because is focus on your problems not on the solutions. I like to hear more positive affirmations an not just let it go and you will find your baby even if is trough adoption. I think is a rip off. If someday I would like to give up on TTC then this is the Cd I would buy but not yet maybe in a couple of year if I am not successful and want to give up. If I decided to give up then this is a great CD to let go and forget about TTC even the affirmations of fertility have a hint of ""adoption"". If you are looking for truly fertility affirmations like: ""I am fertile"" this is not the CD."
3,Close but not the same,"These don't taste the same as the small bags from the vending machines.Very close, but not exactly the same. Crispier (drier) with less veggie taste.The bag's I received are not as shown: they say 'Toasted Chips' & 'Fresh new look'! 'Garden Valley Veggie'.This bag and the Ritz toasted chips are identicalStill a great deal. unable to find these in any supermarket or wholesale club. Only at Amazon!!Update: Found them at BJ's club today for less money."
5,Love it,"I bought two different sizes, and this one actually gets more use because it fits almost everything and is perfect size for most meats."
2,Very stupid episode,"This episode, stay, is the worst in an at best mediocre series. It is so stupid that the actors seem on the verge of laughing when they say their lines."
4,Cool show,"This is kind of like x files where many one show plots independently surround a deeper, more mysterious story that carries on across multiple seasons. Great show."
2,The dubbing was off for half of the show.,"I love Haven, it has just the right combination of suspense and drama without too much to think about; it's just great fun for relaxing after a difficult day at work. But this episode's dubbing was off for half of the show and that was really frustrating. New cahracters and new plots are being developed so not knowing exactly what was going on was a bummer. I would like to get my money back."
5,Haven Season 3,Awesome show - each season builds on the prior season and each episode explores the mystery of Haven and the characters.
5,Always interesting!,"This is a series that has good personalities for the main characters, a little bit of a love story, and a whole lot of mystery and surprises in each episode. Now we finally know who the Colorado Kid is, too!"
5,Love it!,I was told about this show from a co worker and I couldn't believe how addicted the show became. I bought all the seasons and now anticipate each week for a new episode to air.....love it!!!!
2,It's getting dumb,"Yes, I know it's total fantasy. However, the way that she takes in stride that she doesn't even know WHO she truely is is odd. And no one seems too upset that really weird stuff keeps happening. At least in X-Files people were appropriatly amazed and weirded out by strange things, and didn't EXPECT things to be that way. I was addicted to the first season, lukewarm about the second season, and now I don't really care if I see the rest of the third season or not. I'll watch it if none of my other shows have a new episode posted yet."
5,Haven Season 3 is Great,Haven you have not let me downthe Season # 3 is as great as the pilot...thank you so much for not being like the other series that run out of material
1,Compatibility Issues,"Cosmetically pleasing is about the only good thing you can say about this unit. The included software does contain viruses. The included software is a reminate of the late 80's to early 90's. The tablet itself does not work under Win2000 nor WinXP. Under 98 second edition it stops responding quite frequetly and you have to unplug and plug the unit back in to get it to respond again. This unit would be great, if it came out 7 years ago. You get what you pay for."
1,Rubbish,I was given this tablet as a gift and despite all my efforts to install it on two different PC's I am unable to make it work. I believe the problem is in the software for the pen and I have finally given up. It appears that the manufacturers are now out of business so any driver update is out of the question. I will view any KB Gear in the future with a great deal of caution.
1,terrible,"the songs on this album are awful , so glad i didnt buy this garbage. only good song on this is b.y.o.b. im so glad they broken up or theyd release more crap like this. system of a downs first and second album which was toxicity was great albums. after that they just started to suck really bad."
1,a fan since day one,this album is awful. i sold it an hour after i bought it. there are two good songs on the album and the radio stations have already shoved them down our necks. save your money go buy a clutch album.
4,A liitle disappointed with this CD....,"I'm a 46 year old mother of 3 who somewhat embarassedly loves SOAD. Toxicity is one of my favorite Cds. When I heard BYOB on the radio..they were on the ""everybody goin to the party""..part and I freaked when my son told me it was SOAD. Now I think it's one of the best songs ever made. However, being a mom, I'm sensitive to vulgar language and was disappointed with the lyrics of the other songs. Although I think most of the songs are good musically, I can only give it a 4, or even a 3 1/2 if I could figure out how to do that, because of the language."
3,What?,"After waiting with baited breath for the release of this album, i couldent help being a little dissapointed, the reason for the 3 stars... 1 star for Revenga, 1 star for Question & 1 star for Sad Statue, the remaining of the album came across as a joke, and whats with Daron singing with his stupid lyrics,(lost in Hollywood) it ruined the whole album... ARRGGGHHH!!!!"
4,An okay reveiw from Connor D.G,"This album is okay.I bought it from Walmart,and it was cut andclean.This was a pretty good until you got to ""Lost in Hollywood""that is the only crappy song on it."
3,A step down,"This is a step down from their earlier work but still worth listening to. Some of the songs are kind of stupid but I think that is to be expected from SOAD. I think, perhaps, that the creative well ran dry while putting together this album."
3,ROCK IS DEAD,"This isn't per-say a bad album, tracks such as BYOB and Old School Hollywood (I can see this being their next single) are as creative as they are melodic and heavy. On the other hand, it doesn't really offer anything not already presented by SOAD... it's more of the same. And really, this album isn't even worth comparing to their first two. All of this being said, this is still the best album rock has produced in a long time (though doesn't stand up to albums such as Sage Francis' ""A Healthy Distrust"")... and SOAD IS WITHOUT A DOUBT THE BEST BAND ROCK OUT THERE. Still i'll be honest, as much as I love SOAD, I can see those of us who already own their first three albums (and some imports) getting tired of Mezmerize very quickly. If you've never boutght a SOAD album and are thinking of buying one, buy the first one- it'll blow you away... where as this latest release may not even blow you."
4,evolution,"album is defintely worth checking out, despite what elitist prog metal fanboys think.check out:-the Dillinger Escape Plan............Miss Machine-Meshuggah............................Catch 33-Mastodon.............................Leviathan-Fredrik Thordendal...................Sol Niger Within"
4,rock on,I liked mezmerize becuse it was hard core. system of a down is one of the best rock bands out there. i recommend this CD to people that likes hard core rock.
3,Dont believe the hype.,"Ive always been a big system fan, so I went into this album with great expectations only to come away sorely dissapointed. Musically, its amazing. Lyrically, its a mess. Most songs only have a few lines that are repeated over, and over, and over, and could have been written by a 12 year-old. Theres a few goods songs (namely Cigaro, Sad Statue, and Lost in Hollywood), but for every good song theres a bad one (Radio/Video, Violent Pornography?). Download the three mentioned, and wait for ""Hypnotize"" this fall."
4,Mezmerize - a great EP,"Outstanding effort, but the fact that this album is only 38 MINUTES LONG positively REEKS of greed and hypocrisy, especially given the strident anti-consumerism espoused by the band. If Hypnotize is the same lenth, SOAD's loyal fans will have gotten a wonderful one-for-the-price-of-two deal. Yuck."
4,distinctive sound...,"SOAD definetly sounds like no other band out there, that's why I bought this cd... It's good on a whole, but I would like to point out for those who are looking for extremly philosophical and deep lyrics: you won't get them here, (with the partial exception of sad statue and lost in hollywood) SOAD should not be known for excellent lyrics because they are much too repetitive and obvious. THIS DOES NOT MEEN THAT THIS IS A BAD RECORD!!! The guitars and melodies in this are very clever. One of SOAD's amazing abilities is being able to change from soft lulling and wonderfull melodies to sharp shocking and hard crashing guitar riffs.When I listen to this cd I usually skip over Violent Pornagraphy because it is extremly repetitive and anoying, but I like all the other songs. Some of the best songs are Sad Statue, Lost in Hollywood, and Cigaro. Before getting this you may want to pick up Toxicity if you havn't allready because it is definetly their best."
4,THUMBS UP SYSTEM OF A DOWN,"System of a Down's MEZMERIZE is a triumphant return from one of the most innovative metal bands today. Speed/Thrash riffs with Death Metal shouts that demand attention. Serj Tankian's absurd, quirky melodies are as unique as ever and he gets additional help with vocals on this album from guitarist Daron Malakian contributing to even more insane songs. The content is what you would expect from a political band who are descendants of a country sharing a border with Iraq. The only disappointing element of this album are the majority of the songs (even when making bold statements) rely on SOAD's juvenile humor rather than more complex lyrics like ""Spiders"", ""Chop suey!"", ""Toxicity"" and ""Aerials"". But in the end the creativity of bands like System of a Down and Fair to Midland(ftmband.com) are what keeps metal interesting today."
3,love em....but dissappointed,"i consisder myself a big fan of soad, but i feel this album lags in a few departments. it might just be me but im not a fan of daron malakians voice, its a bit to squirrelly for me. its seem as if darons head got to big and he had a power trip. not only does he sing 3 times more than he did in the last album,but he seems to have made a point to put his name above serjs and is stepping up as the ""lead man"". i find his voice to be a distraction from the songs in this one. the harmonizing in this album is great but once again u can hear darons voice well over serjs.darons a great guitarist but he needs to shut his mouth a bit more and let serj do the singing."
1,Warning!,"I used to like system of a down, and I also bought into the hype of their new cd. I heard the 2 singles on the radio,""BYOB"" and ""Cigaro"" and those songs seemed to be good. However, after hearing the album those 2 are the only decent songs on the whole thing! Not to mention their lyrics are just stupid. I think this is by far their worst work yet and if you realy like the radio hits I would suggest you download them. Then maybe these guys will get the message, that they have to start writing better stuff!"
2,I was excited to hear this,"Daron has just got to stop singing. Serj's unique, sometimes amazing vocals are arguably System's best asset. I can't believe how much of a step back this is for System. Songs like Cigaro have nothing to offer. Compare this album to Toxicity, you'll hardly know you're listening to the same band."
2,"Definately not their best, probably their worst","I've been a system fan for a long time and own every cd, this one let me down. Of course the politcal commentary is always good but the songs just don't give you that same tingly feeling....the style seems different--scarely closer to Presidents than the system I love. It's alright, but don't waste your money on this CD.2 stars for 2 good songs"
4,5 stars for music + 3 stars for lyrics -> 4 stars,"I'm not a metal fan per se, although I do love a lot of bands that play pretty heavy music (Helmet, King Crimson, Faith No More. . .). IMO, SOAD's music is very sophisticated and avant garde in a lot of ways, and is a good match for fans of those three bands. Musically I like this album a LOT, and appreciate the genre-hopping that this release adds to their repertoire; it's definitely reminiscent of FNM. But. . . while I agree with the politics of the lyrics I think their execution is pretty sophomoric. I hope that with the next album they write they can come up with lyrics that better fit the intelligence of the music without compromising their viewpoint.I also really like the Armenian musical influence that they bring, and hope they pursue this more. I'm a fan of traditional Armenian music (e.g., the band Arev). Bringing in this influence helps give SOAD a unique sound.Recommended."
2,UNclassic,"This is what happens when a band goes mainstream. The CD is mediocre. Serj seriously doesn't need to be pushed to backup vocals. He's an awesome singer and the other guy is just a squeeky mouse. What happened to you SOAD? Your first CD was amazing and original. Now, your just another band."
3,Aux Champes Elysees,Joe Dassin in classical form. A rich compilation of his songs including the widely known cover title track. A must for any student trying to learn understandable French from listening to music.
2,Where's the beef?,"I read this book, and there just wasn't enough practical information in it. There were too many stories about other folks, and not enough practical information about clearing up clutter. If you need a spiritual boost and want to read about others battling clutter than this book is OK. NOT OK if you're wanting some info on methods of clearing up your stuff."
4,Cool Hat,"Hat is light weight, great for hot summer days outside. Build quality is pretty good considering the cost. Won't last as long as other caps I have but the tradeoff is worth it to me."
5,Stunning Photos,"If you're a cruiser, this book will make your mouth water with its stunning photos of ships. A Christmas gift I will long cherish."
3,Not for use on glass tops,"I love this pot. It is great but buyers should understand that the label on this pot states that it is not to be used on glass tops, although the description of the items as shown on Amazon does not indicate this important fact. It is a great pot for gas stoves or electric burner stoves but not for glass top. Unfortunately, I have a glass top stove but I will not return this item because by the time I pay postage, this is no longer a good deal. I will give it to my daughter-in-law who does not have a glass top. She will love it because it is actually a good stock pot."
2,Damaged,The item arrived dented and rusted in several different places and I had to return it. It was not packaged very well and banged around in the box it was shipped in.
1,Not as advertised.,"I should have read the reviews, but instead I trusted the product description: 'Used, like new.' How far from the truth that statement is; I would appreciate a more honest and accurate statement in the future, but sense it is doubtful that I will order anything from Amazon that is not media-related, it doesn't matter. My stockpot was chipped and dented both inside and out. Frankly it is worthless. and here I was thinking I was going to save money. Now I must purchase a NEW one. I only want the next consumer to be fore-warned. Buyer beware; things are not always as they appear, or as described."
4,Classic Sandi,"I have been listening to Sandi Patty since she was an opening act for Bill and Gloria Gaither. I can still clearly remember the chills I got the first time I heard ""We Shall Behold Him.""The good news is, Sandi's spectacular voice is as great as ever. Yes, she has previously recorded a lot of the songs on this 2-CD set. But they don't sound exactly the same on this new release. A few of the best songs on this set are ""Higher Ground,"" a soulful , gospel version of ""Blessed Assurance"" and an Appalachian-style ""Precious Memories"" medley. The three patriotic songs are heart-stirring.I know that ""The Prayer"" has already been recorded by the duos of Andrea Bocelli/Celine Dion and Josh Groban/Charlotte Church. I don't think Sandi Patty and her husband, Don, do quite as well as the others.If you are a Sandi Patty fan, you will not be disappointed in this album."
4,An excellent dictionary but there are a few flaws.,"When I first got this book I was disappointed but you should never judge or book by its cover. The dictionary seemed to be bland and uninspiring. When I began to use this book the definitions were invaluable. The sheer number of entries for classical civilisation is outstanding. The dictionary covers a vast range of topics from the Spartacus revolt to the attitudes of classical civilisation towards animals. The latter was something that I never would have thought of.The dictionary does have flaws. Some of the explanations were too dry and academic. For example, the entry on Ceres, s Roman goddess, was confusing and offered no real insight. The other main flaw is that there are no maps or diagrams. Something as simple as a map can greatly increase your comprehension of historical events.Despite the flaws this is an excellent reference book to have if you are interested in classical civilisation."
4,Good Suppliment to Psysiology Text,"I bought this book as a suppliment to my text in my 1st year of medical school. It is a great outline of important concepts and topics for physiology, the only drawback is that it is really only an outline and has almost no supplimental or explanatory material outside of the bare-bones outlining. It is more of a USMLE study guide than a study guide for beginning medical school students."
3,Good but Enough Already!,"Mean Justice is an obviously well-researched book that tells it's story too convincingly and at too great a lenghth. It remains worthwhile reading but someone should have edited Mr. Humes work by 50 pages or so. Those unfamiliar with the author may prefer ""Mississippi Mud"". California residents should find ""Mean Justice"" particularly interesting."
1,Poor Research = Sensationalistic Reading,"Whereas this book reads quite well it is perhaps better labeled as fiction. Having first hand knowledge of many of the described events, it sadly seems that selling books has become more important than factual accuracy. Local news reported tonight that a 100 page analysis of this book's factual inaccuracies will soon be released. That should make for an interesting counter-point."
2,Just not good history,"I found this book disappointing. It is a history of astronomy written by possibly a very good astronomer---but not a good historian. He is given to sweeping statements what are unsupported, and often unsupportable. For instance, he blames Christianity for the fall of Rome, and believes it has always been institutionally antagonistic to science; these contentions are at best very simplistic, and arguably quite wrong. As far as the science goes, I found his explanation of the seasons simply confusing. There are far better histories of astronomy available, in particular ""The Cambridge Illustrated History of Astronomy"", which I highly recommend."
2,"a painted, polished turd...","reviewer ross pretty much said all that needs to be said about this book. the style is the biggest problem, followed by the stories. a work shouldn't bore you; but there is a fine line between succulent and overstuffed turkey prose. downriver is a burst bird.remember this, if some obscure work is built up to be the greatest book no one's ever read outside of some critics trying to pull one out of leftfield to impress others (and they probably never read it anyway, too much of a bother)...never forget the work was hopelessly obscure for a reason. silly poets."
5,Sing along with your kids!,"Big Trouble is one of those albums that is just as entertaining for us parents as it is for our kids. Car trips are far more pleasant with Ezra and Keith along for the ride. My younger son continually giggles through ""Proper Cup of Coffee"" and both my boys love rocking out to the We are the Dinosaurs song. ""Big Trouble"" is also one of their favorites and has prompted quite a few conversations on whether it was the werewolf or the vampire who ate the cookies (with my younger son), and whether the song is really about monsters or about a kid who messed stuff up and is going to tell his parents it was the monsters who did it (with my older son). I highly recommend this album!"
5,Best flashlight ever,Point it at someone weather in the day or night and you blind them. This is the best flashlight I have ever bought. I have many flashlights too being an inspector. You'll like this one. Can't go wrong for the money!
2,I've seen better,"Even though this is for ""idiots"" it was still not as idiot-proof as I was hoping. It seems more geared for buying/acquiring/merging larger sized companies. I was really looking for Small Business. I purchased another book ""Business Buyer's Kit"" which was much easier to follow and more comprehensive."
1,Smaller & Thinner than the 'Old Rubbermaid',"Like the other reviews, the mat doesn't stick to my sink eathor so when I put pots or pans on it (to scrub) it slips all over the place.It only covers 1/2 of the middle divider.On the websight it looks like they're dark brown, but the true color is grey.This is nothing like the rubbermaid mats I've bought in the past..which I've heard they've replace with these. :(It was a waste of my money."
5,"GREAT c.d, all who are latin should buy it","this c.d is a great one, especially the track number 17, contaminame. woo over anybody by singing it, y a los muchachos que estan en lios con su novias, haceles una serenata de esta cancion, y veras como vienen corriendo! that means for you guys that are in trouble with your women, then, sing this song, and see how she will come running back! great song."
3,what i expected,good quality and no complaints. i put a velcro backing on it because i didnt want to use a hot iron on my backpack.worked quite well.
3,"From the Discworld--ho, hum","I'm a big discworld fan and a so-so ambient music fan--this album fell into the second category. If you're the ""buy everything with Pratchett on it!!!!!"" sort, this is *almost* a must-have. If you just enjoy the books, don't bother. I've almost given this one away twice now. I did enjoy the ""Stick and Bucket Dance,"" which was clever and well-executed, and thought ""Wizard's Staff"" was a good modern folk song, though it could have used a bit more innuendo. Try and find a few of the songs and listen before you buy this one--it's not what you're thinking."
4,NOT THE BEST CD I OWN BUT SO WORTH IT,OK so it doesn't have the hedgehog song but it is an excelent inturpitation of the discworld. i played it while reading pyrimids and it enhanced the experiance. sure i would not listen to it all the time but it is worth having just to get all of discworld yo can experiance. a definat must for atrue pratchett fan
3,In the Clenches of disease...,"This bat book lays some of the groundwork for later Gotham tales, notably Cataclysm and the resulting No Mans Land. It could be tricky to get into if you're not a regular Batman reader - the Azrael components might seem confusing if you haven't read Sword of Azrael (and Knightfall/Knightquest/Knightsend).However, on its own the tale is pretty good; the art is decent and the writing is well done. It's wrapped up a bit too nicely with no real impact to the member of the bat-family who becomes infected with the disease (and I wonder how his attendant during the illness didn't get it), but that's to be expected in this sort of tale. Unlike NML that comes later, you can read Contagion without needing to get further sequels..."
1,Political opinions can be left at home,"This is an entertaining and informative book about sentence diagramming. There are humerous stories about Sister Bernadette's sixth grade class where the author learned to diagram. However, in the middle of the book, the author digresses, commenting on her opinion of George W. Bush. I found this section of the book irritating, off topic and unrelated to the rest of the book - a chance for her to vent."
5,Works for Me,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book as a great teaching tool. I would like to see it introduced into our school system. Where's the second book to this, Dr. Hayes?"
3,Light weight,"I chose it for its size , but would have like it better if it was made out of heavier material"
3,Good and bad news,"The good news is that the roaster arrived undamaged and is of good enough quality for my intended uses of it, namely roasting food. The bad news is that the manufacturer must use a different ruler than the one I have at home. It is actually 18.5 x 14 x 4.75. Luckily, it will do and I'm glad to have it since it's the largest I've found anywhere (including specialty kitchenware stores). One caveat: Use potholders and grab it by the sides because on close inspection I could tell that the handles were only soldered on and could possibly break off if you lift it fully loaded."
1,Not even close to advertised dimensions,"I bought one of these over the holidays to cook a large rib roast that was too large for my other 18"" pans. Unfortunately, while the pan is advertised and labeled as 21.5"" it is a 17.5"" pan."
5,Great Product,"I've been using Granite Ware for quite some time. I bought this particular product some while ago and never regreted buying it. It's light weight is very much appreciated, for I've been cooking for quite a crowd, and the meat portions have to be big. Cleaning this Roaster is very easy, due to the enamel. Although, I've been sceptical about byuing it at first, it has become a kitchen jewel over the years."
2,Suprised it got great reviews,I ordered this because of all the great reviews - but now I'm wondering why. Mine arrived dented (and it seems to dent very easily) and overall it seems like cheap Chinese junk. I might be happy if I only paid a dollar - but honestly at this price I find it hard to say much that is positive.
3,Works as described.,"I have been using this (double boiler) bowl for a couple months. It works great for cheeses and chocolate. I really like the different grooves that allow it to ""mount"" in nearly any sized saucepan. I personally have had 0 issues with foods getting ""stuck"" in the grooves, then again I rarely allow food to dry on my pans before washing them so that may be the issu."
3,Functional Double Boiler Insert,I bought this because I didn't want to spend a lot of money on an expensive double boiler that I would rarely use. This one works fine but the round grooves that make it possible to seat it into almost any pot you already have are difficult to clean if you make things like old fashioned tapioca. Other than that it is a clever and good quality product for a very reasonable price. The laborious cleaning is the reason for three rather than five stars. When I have used it for other things I'll update this.
2,Bring back his later CDs,"This is early Moe Koffman. Swinging Shepherd Blues became his ""theme"" song. But his later work is much better. His album of Bach tunes is fantastic (not sure this ever made it to CD), and I loved his Best of Moe Koffman vols 1+2 CD to death. Now I find it's out of print and I can't replace it. Major bummer. This is his best CD and seriously needs reissuing.PS. Koffman died about a year ago. Wouldn't this be a good time for some retrospective CD?"
5,The Tortois and the Hare,"When my daughter was 2 years old, she loved the listening option where the book is read to her on the computer, and she didn't have to do anything to ""turn"" the pages. Now that she's 3 years old, she loves the interactive option where she can click on the pages and see the animations move and make sounds."
3,Toto's best,"Toto IV is by far my favorite thing this band produced. In fact, really the only song by them I love that's not on this album is Hold The Line. Toto is a true studio musician all star assembly group, and their music is very professional, very solid, well produced, and generally flawless in execution. The music is commercial pop, with an 80s vibe, and ranges from ballads to... not ""hard"" rock but I guess I'd call it pop rock. The highlights are Steve Lukather's guitar solos and the vocals/harmonies. One of my favorite guitar solos of all time is in Rosanna. Ironicly, for being one of the world's best guitar players, Lukather holds back a lot with Toto I guess to help make the music more mainstream. If you want to check out Toto, or are a fan of their big hits, I'd say get IV over any ""best of/greatest hits"" compilations because this is their best stuff right here. Standout tracks: Rosanna, Make Believe, Africa."
4,Mr Dubin tribute,"Back when I was in 4th grade in a time when the state of California actually supported music and arts in the public schools, this piano playing dude Mr Dubin used to drop by once a week to teach us a song or two. Along with a arm-waving Ebony and Ivory rendition, he got us going loud and proud with Toto's Africa.He started with the piano pounding:Bownanow na now na nowdoodle-oodle doodle-oodle doodle-oodle doodle-oodleBownanow na now na nowdoodle-oodle doodle-oodle doodle-oodle doodle-oodleSo imagine a classroom full of kids going from the laid-back opening lines and then exploding to the big, ""I bless the rains down in Africa!""Doesn't get much better than that. Plus, I learned all about Kilamanjaro.So California...cut the football team, leave the music class alone! (or bring back the slush property taxes! hehehe)"
2,Great sound - two CD players were received defective,"I have received 2 complete stereos systems and both arrived with non-functioning CD changers. The first CD changer at least played Disc 1 but the second CD changer plays no discs and will not release the 3 CDs that I put in it. I will have to go to a service center just to get the CDs out before I return the unit. Furthermore, this unit is fairly expensive and the FM antenna shipped with it is a simple wire without a connector. They expect you to buy an adaptor or another antenna. However, the sound is great."
3,Great concept but disappointing quality,"I was excited to find these shirts on line, as I thought the ""A Train"" version would make a unique gift for my husband. After paying over thirty dollars for this t-shirt, however ($22 for the shirt itself plus a whopping $9 for shipping!), I was extremely disappointed in the quality of the shirt once it arrived. The shirt was not the thick, beefy style which one generally sees in most screen-printed t-shirts; rather, it was ridiculously thin, so thin that it would've been see-through had it not been for the black color of the shirt. Furthermore, I purchased the t-shirt in a size medium for my 5'6"" husband, and it was overly long, which made the logo appear too low. For a $10 shirt, these flaws may have been acceptable, but for the money I paid, we decided to return the shirt. Again, this is a great concept, but it's a shame that these shirts were not better executed."
2,Something's missing...,"I remember the hype surrounding the first Lone Justice album back in the 80's. It took me a long time to listen to the entire album, but there was something about it that drew me in and made me a fan of Maria's voice and the songs. This continued through her first two solo albums; I enjoyed the changes in the music and found all of the albums most enjoyable.That has really changed in ""High Dive"" -- I don't care for the album at all. Maria's voice is as beautiful as ever, but I just don't get into the songs. When listening I can't escape the feeling that all of the music was recorded elsewhere, and she's just singing on top of it; the emotion just doesn't come through. My wife commented that it sounded like a soundtrack for a Broadway musical or something; not bad in its own right but not what she (or I) in general want to listen to.It's not likely I'll be playing this CD very much. I hope her next effort will be little (if anything) like this one."
3,Good but....,"It's a good book, BUT one thing is that it constantly refers to 'what is coming.' Nothing is 'coming' IT ALREADY IS HERE! We are experiencing the shift as of 1900, but objectively as of 2000. So, it has already been taking place. Owens book gets 3 stars because it's a good introduction to what is occurring. A more thorough book on the subject, but deeper and something to really sink your teeth into is The Shift: A Time of Change by David Tate. It's taken straight from the horse's mouth, as it were. The book is a collection of transcripts of channelled material by Elias, an essence whose sole aim is to minimize trauma during this shift in consciousness - because a lot of people generally are resistant to change, or are confused by what is happening and so there will naturally be some trauma going on. I read it in my times of worry and within minutes I feel at ease."
2,Try to buy another camera,"I am disappointed with the quality of the pictures taken in the scene modes, in some of them the white balance is not Ok or the pictures appear to have bad definition, although in auto mode it appears to be a little better. Also in the HQ 30 fps movie mode, the maximum duration of the movie the camera can capture is only 10 seconds. I thought that this limitation has gone in the past (in deed some old models overcome it), and the new Olympus model is not affected with it. Also trying to solve this problem by myself, because the Olympus technical assistance took 10 days to answer an e-mail confirming the camera limitation (Ticket #2132043), I bought a 1Gb type H XD Olympus memory to try if the movies can be longer, but it was the same.Sorry but I will not recommend this camera to my friends."
1,God awful,To say that Rob Van Dam the pro wrestler plays in this awful movie.It really hurt watching
1,what were they thinking?,"what do you get when you mix the power rangers' villians with wrestling? this load of crap called black mask 2. the computer animation was par with lets say the old apple computers that they had in schools back in the 80's. the acting was just about as bad as you could have in a movie mass produced. i will not be surprised if i learn that they lost money on this project. maybe i will make ""black mask 3: crap kicked sideways"" with my personel cam corder and use my pc for the special effects and they will release that for me. that would be about as entertaining as this, but i guess i would need some wrestlers like triple h or booker t as the main characters."
1,Very Disappointing,"I suppose what made this movie such a let down was the fact that Jet Li made no return and there was nearly no return from any other character in the original cast. This movie is a cheesy knock-off of X-Men and while the director overly uses his computer generated effects in an attempt to accentuate the picture and make the movie a bigger hit, it only makes the movie worse. The martial arts scenes are so lame that I was surprised to see no use of onomatopoeia following every punch and kick. The characters are laughable and cannot be taken very seriously. For those hoping to see a great movie involving Jet Li, don't be fooled. He does not appear in this movie at all, and to buy this movie would simply be a wasted effort."
1,Garbage!,"So bad, that I feel like I was robbed of a fortune even though I paid a dollar for the tape!The original Black Mask was a masterpiece compared to this thing. Everything is terrible with this movie. The cast, the directing, the story, the special effects. It stinks. I turned it off after about twenty minutes.I wish I could find someone stupid enough to accept it to give it away to!"
4,Black Mask -- Not Black Biker-Leather!,"I thought there was nothing wrong with Black Mask 2 whatsoever! The action was beautiful, the costumes were ""on-point"", and style was like how a ""super-hero comic-book""-style movie is supposed to look like and be like ...with the regular people as inferior back-drops and minimal, but necessary cop-show droppings. The producers, creators, and directors of this movie should do all the superhero comic-book movies this way. The costumes --like the character(s) powers-- should be unique to each of their personalities, and not look like something that is seen every day. We should be in AWE! I'm ordering this DVD for myself and, as a teaching tool. Highly Recommended!!!"
2,City of What MASK.,"OK, This movie is there as a B-Rated Movie.The CGI is to fake and yet still cool.The Fight Scenes are not like Jet Li's style.Andy On makes a great Black Mask,But I cant really except him well as I did with Jet Li.His Style of fighting is well done with Yuen Wo Ping's Fight director.Story:[Stinks].Plot:[Stinks]MOVIE:it's okTo Buy this movie:Go ahead if you have BLACK MASK 1Also This movie doesnt have the HIP POP soundtrack Like it did with the like the first movie.And theres Too many Monster's.And to much to take this Movie seriouslly.I love HK Movies,but this makes it too amature than Pro."
5,"Fun, Refreshing, and Addictive!!!","From beginning to end, the book had me laughing!!!!! It also contains some good themes and lessons that I Will hold tight to!!!!!I am definitely going to read his other books!!!!!"
2,Quality lacking,"While this book has been described as ""light and breezy,"" the author could have done more work on the writing quality. It's pedestrian, at best. The first person point of view works, but there isn't enough happening in this novel to keep it interesting."
1,Boring,"Flabbergasted has a unique story idea and is well written. However, it had no plot and I could not wait for it to be finished. I almost quit reading it several times, but perservered,waiting for something to happen. Nothing ever did. An incredibly boring novel."
1,"Boring, trite, bad editing","Being from the south, and struggling with my own writing, I really, really, really wanted to like this book. I (and my husband) came away very disappointed in this first outing by Ray Blackston.The story doesn't ring true, plot points are not explored fully, and a great big nothingness consumes many, many pages. I read an interview with Mr. Blackston where he explained how much of this novel came from his real-life experiences, and apparently he never really had to create anything new.The book needed a much heavier editing hand, and the twee voice Blackston gives Jay Jarvis is just too treacly.Give this one a big miss."
3,If You Take Insulin...,"This book is not geared for you--diet wise, that is. It has good information about how glucose and insulin interact, and a thorough explanation of nutrients, vitamins, and minerals for insulent resistant people. However, the authors caution that ""the Anti-X diet should not be followed by insulin-dependent diabetics."" That was disappointing to me, as a diabetic hoping to find help through the plan."
1,please do not buy this book,"the menu plan was too low carb and the supplement suggestions were worse!it claims that folks 20 pounds overweight and over should take a supplement called L-Carnitine, Alpha Lipoic acid etc.Well when I took the Carnitine, I swear the first time I took it, my heart was beating too fast and the second time, I felt a heaviness in my chest and I had dry mouth! When I did further research on these supplements, it had said that we really don't need the Lipoic acid and the Carnitine because it is already present in our systems!So the authors owe me $$$ back for those supplements that got me sick! Heck they should give me $$$ back for buying this dumb book lol"
3,"too small for some 13.3"" laptops","PRO: Very light weight; Looks very stylish; Has room for my power brickCON: Barely fits my 13.3"" Sony Vaio; If your laptop is wider than 12"" it may be exposed to the elements at the top corners of the bag; No real storage for documentsThis bag is good for keeping my laptop safe traveling to and from work without being a hassle, but that's about it."
5,Nice case for the price.,"I don't understand why people give this case bad reviews. I have two large slr cameras- a Nikon d70 and a Fuji S2 pro. I bought one for the Fuji and liked it so much , I bought another for the Nikon. You don't pay 10 to 20 dollars for a plastic case and expect it to last forever. I take care of my cases and they work fine for me. If you want durability, pay 50 to 100 dollars for a leather case."
2,Looks Nice but Doesn't Last,"I've had this bag for three or 4 years. It was fine for a while, but the materials are actually quite shoddy. It recently started to fall apart. The webbing and handle has shredded and I'll have to buy a new case."
3,charlie poole,I have listen to all 3 cds and they really set you back in time. I really like Charlie Poole and his band. I think this is a great CD collection for the price.
3,Flashy,"Dispite the quality look, I found this collection to be rather cheap. The CDs are packed in paper sleaves, and the cardboard ""cigar box"" is nothing but a gimmick. An interesting ""book"" is included which gives a good history.Be warned that this is not a 3 CD collection of Charlie Poole songs, infact the second and third CD's are only about half Poole. The other half is other versions of songs covered by Poole performed by Poole's contemporaries. So what you end up paying for is someone's intellectual study into the influence of Poole, and a cardboard cigar box. The JSP box set provides much more bang for much less buck. But Atleast Sony is putting Poole's music out."
4,Great CDs. Great musician.,"I love the CDs, although I end up only listening to the first one, since it's all Charlie. I wish the other ones had less of the other musicians and more of Charlie. So many of his songs that I was looking forward to aren't there. I'd much rather have all of his music and less of someone else's. Even if they had put all of his together and then included another CD of the other musicians would have been great. But I'm thrilled with the book and the Charlie music. Fell in love with him all over again!"
3,My Brain is Short Circuiting!,"That's how it sounds in my headphones right now. If you're looking at this, you're probably aware that Autechre is a very challenging listen. Their explorations seldom resemble music these days; it's an amalgam of breakbeat arrhythmias merged with granular dysfunction over a swath of downsampled melodies that skip and blurp in a seemingly random fashion. Most of the reviewers here concede that Autechre doesn't care if they alienate their fans. Maybe so, or maybe they're just so far ahead that it will take us years to catch up and fully appreciate it. Whatever the case may be, I continue to buy their records. Whether you love 'em or hate 'em, one thing is clear: nobody else sounds like Autechre. My 3 year old son says it sounds like broken robot music. Yeah, that's about right."
2,Nothing new,"Nothing new here. These guys need to get back to their roots of innovation and stop trying to get further ""out there"" with each release."
4,Igloo Magazine's REVIEW,"Review by: Pietro Da Sacco at [...](04.23.03) What else is there to say? Yet another Autechre release and one that finds the meticulous and pioneering duo of Sean Booth & Rob Brown massaging their sound-escapes with even more precision and engineering. The preceding Gantz Graf EP left the audience to wonder if Ae would further develop their mangled electronic mayhem or if in fact they'd calm down and amplify the vibe to a more earthly level. Well, Draft 7.30 tends to point closer to the latter effect; Elements of well preserved bass-rhythms and disjointed beats tumble all across the landscape while time shifts and melody chunks are casually tossed in the mix. As if almost alive, Draft 7.30 dissolves into the subconscious as a complete entity of escalated experiments going back in time and stepping directly into the future. Comparable to EP7 and Tri-Repetae, Autechre have drafted the blueprints of electronics for several years to come.. as expected."
1,"This is my first review, and I was very, very disappointed.","We purchased the DELONGHI DCR902T coffee maker on April 3rd, 2004. By May 1st the coffee maker would not turn on, period. The electronics basically exploded, apparently. The carafe spills coffee each pouring due to a design that has a lid flap interfering with the pouring itself, causing coffee to run down the front (doh!). The worst part, for me, is that I cannot find the receipt anywhere- so I was left with throwing it away. $90 for 3 weeks of coffee- it was about $5 a pot, actually. Very sad!"
5,The aristocratic refinement,"Artur Grumiaux was gifted by the Gods with a fabulous sense of mercurial skillfulness, powerful vibrato, slender lyricism and sheer expression which made of every piece he played an unusual fact to listen.Born in 1921, his fame just began at 18 when he won the Francois Prume and Henri Viextemps, his musical maturity allowed him to experience and enhance with his frequent appearing in Prades, to become one of the most eloquent, elegant and mesmerizing virtuosi of this beloved instrument."
1,A TALE OF TWO CITIES,"VERY POOR acting, in fact I have never seen worse!! Do not recommend this movie, the book was excellent of course."
2,True to the story,The film attempts to stay true to Dickens' book . . but falls short at times because of editing for time. Some of the characters are not allowed to develop sufficiently for the ending to have the book's impact. The lead role was poorly acted.
2,Ouch!,"Okay. No great shakes. I couldn't get up much sympathy for either Carton or Darnay. It is always good to see Peter Cushing, though."
1,Old snake oil in new bottles.,"More proof that P.T. Barnum greatly underestimated the birth rate of suckers. I'm amazed that this book only got one other negative review. This latest ""Idiot's Guide"" is nothing but old snake oil in new bottles, a guide to phenomena which have been repeatedly exposed as fraudulent or non-existent. Since co-author Lynn Robinson is a ""famous psychic,"" don't expect a balanced discussion. The publishers should only sell this one in a two-book package, with ""The Complete Idiot's Guide To Critical Thinking."""
1,Want to end your marriage quickly?,"Then buy this game. Worst 22 hours of my life....Sincerely,SinglePs. No, this game was actually that horrible. Life destoryer."
1,Cheap skin flick,"Look, im not looking for a plot, good acting, or good production. But if you're gonna make a skin flick do it right, show everything. This is just topless tease, nothing more. Look elsewhere for a skin flick."
2,"started great, ended weakly","This book began with a great line and a great premise. Missing girl, fleeing kidnappers, then oh no....! What now? Rebus seemed to have gotten some of his humanity back and the case was interesting...until it wasn't. Rebus has become almost completely unlikable. The episode with the cat was creepy/sociopathic and really made me wonder why I was still reading because it wasn't for the mystery. I couldn't care less about corruption in the dispersal of tax revenue from the Scottish govt. There were multiple pages about who oversaw what section and who reported to who. By the end Rebus is going through the motions for no real reason, though we are supposed to think he now serves 'justice.' This is the seventh that I've read and I own one more, so I'll make it to eight but unless the main character undergoes a personality shift and the story line is one I can care about...that will be the last."
4,Inspirational,"John Wooden is one of the most successful coaches in the history of Basketball, so trusting in his own ""Pyramid of Success"" will be easy. I was surprisingly inspired by this book, and now I truly believe that I can achieve success in my own life by using his guide. Andrew Hill's writting is personal, yet understandable, and certainly kept me interested. This book is an easy read with a great message that is sure to inspire anyone."
4,good but not great,"The book arrived in good condition. I was anticipating it to arrive sooner than it did as my daughter needed it for a class but aside from that, the purchase was a great value and served its purpose well for a college class."
4,A Good Way to Live your Life,"When I first had to read this book for my Honors Economics class, I was very unsure if I was going to like it at all. I have always had a hard time getting along with coaches whom I played for so I was wondering why I had chosen a book that was about a coach. But my fears were laid to rest once I started reading this book; I came to realize that good intentions really are behind many of the decision that coaches make. This book was very well written and kept me wanting to read more. John Wooden's ""Pyramid of Success"" can be interpeted in many different ways. So many aspects of life apply to this pyramid model which can serve as a guide during those moments of feeling lost. This book was entertaning yet full of lessons for a successful life. I especially recommend this book to all athletes who question their coaches' widsom as well as to people who could use a little guidence through life's journey."
2,Just okay,"Had hoped this would work well but after just two weeks, it started to sag in the middle. I'd recommend that you look elsewhere...."
3,Low and my wife could not put it together,"We used these cots 3 times so far and I had to put them together and take them apart. My wife wasn't strong enough. When I slept on it I used a sleeping bag under neath the covers as I think I was hitting the 2 center supports in the middle. It wasn't too bad as I had the sleeping bag and sheets in between and I'm not a heavy person by any means. It was wide enough and long enough so overall I was able to move into spots to avoid the lumps in the center area. They are light and compact for travel. Another problem is getting out of it. It means a sort of rolling out as it is only a few inches off the floor. You can't put your legs over the side in a sitting position as you are too low. At least I can't.You might have the same problem if trying to sit on it and put your clothes on. No, I had to find a chair which we had on 1 of the uses but not the other 2.We use them in a pinch and for that they are ok."
2,Too difficult to assemble,I ended up returning this after opening it and trying to put it together. It was way too difficult to bend the metal pieces and get them into their slots.
4,Fits the need,This is a good space saver cot and seems sturdy. Only issue i see with it is that it's kinda hard to put the legs on if it's a kid trying or female it could be a tuff task. The new handle don't know really if that makes a difference.
4,Good experience for Allagash AL Cot,"Hi,I am using this Allagash AL Cot. I have no problem with this product. This is a good product for camping or for travelling.-Jay"
5,Great Cot,This is a improvement over the cot of this style I had in the scouts for summer camp. It goes together easier and the grip supplied for the support lets is a great idea. I bought 2 of them 1 for me and my wife. We used them on a recent car camp trip and found them comfortable when used with a Thermarest pad.
3,good deal,"I just got back from a 5 night hunting trip using this cot for the first time. I'm over 6' and 210lbs, so here are my thoughts.Pros:very comfortableeasy set up (a little muscle is required, but simple to do)lightweightfairly compact when disassembled6'6"" longnice and wideaffordableCons:overall construction might be a bit flimsy. I wouldn't feel confident if I was over 220lbs, and I can see where the frame might break after a couple of years of assembly/disassembly. Also I could see the canvas-like material getting stretched out and you ending up hitting the ground if you're a bigger person.that's all. It might not be the best overall quality, but it's very comfortable and so affordable. I recommend it over a lot of other more costly cots on the market. Buy with confidence if you're 200lbs or less."
3,"Made in China, Not Maine","This cot is relatively easy to assemble if you are strong and seems very sturdy. The frame is all metal,not partially wood as pictured and the whole thing is made in China, not in Maine. Otherwise, it seems to be a good functional item."
4,Decent,The only con about this is that the canvas stretches with prolonged use. Other than that it has served us well. My daughter took it to chicago during a mission trip and she said it was comfortable. She now uses it as a place for her friends to sleep on when she has them overnight.
3,"Looks nice, but a poor fit to the Kalevala","As a tarot deck, this one is attractive. The accompanying book has brief descriptions of the various characters from the Kalevala, the Finnish national epic, and their histories. Unfortunately, the fit between the characters and the meanings given for the cards is often very forced -- a disappointment to me as a Kalevala lover. I guess I'll stick to keeping the Kalevala and tarot separate."
2,cheaply made,"This battery pack was very flimsy and did not seem to hold the 2 canon batterys, although it did hold AA battteries."
1,"Cheapo, no control button at all","Refused to work upon arrival. Drains fully charged canon battery in seconds. Probably I got a bad copy. Anyway it is cheaply built, with not even a shutter release button."
1,Dovetail rings,"These will NOT fit a standard weaver or picatinny rail.....they are for 3/8"" dovetail mounts and I just wasted my money. Be foreworned-apparently I missed the 22 part but the description talks about weaver mounts so idk."
2,Is this really an air freshener?,Nice eye-catching chrome design but scent is weak and barely noticeable if you put your nose next to it. Forget about using it in your car to freshen the cabin.
4,Ya don't have to touch it to feel it Braille Blues.,If someone is lookin' for a benchmark for a Blues CD this is one of them. Bryan Lee doesn't sing the Blues he DOES the BLUES. If ya don't know the differences absorb this CD. Lee does some of his own material and other people stuff. You will wonder why they didn't do it his way he own it. Cadillac Pete with the Rolls Royce tone and his Corvette cut on Blues Harp outstanding. Larry Williams & Al Arthur keep everyone together with the heartbeat of the band. How bout some Johnnie Johnson style Piano they have that with Piano Willie O'Shawny. Billy Flynn & Bryan Lee handle the Guitar work. If ya don't get it have your vestibulocochlears checked. If ya live in the East Bay check out some Blues on KECG 88.1 / 97.7. Saturday mornings 7/9 AM when it is really Blue out! Blue Wave Radio G Hanes over.
2,A Greeting Card Program that is not user friendly,"I bought The Greeting Card Factory Deluxe version about a month ago with an instruction booklet included. However even with the booklet by my side, I had difficulty setting up the correct printing options for envelopes you can create. Even though on screen help was very good, their phone support was slow and not toll free. The average wait time during peak business hours is 15 minutes. Fortunately, I was very patient working it out myself and achieved the cards I wanted, but, I would not recommend this product to anyone who is on a tight schedule as this will not solve your greeting card woes."
1,Vulgar.,"Mr. Lozoya's portraits can only be described as vulgar. The lighting is harsh and contrasty giving his portraits an ""apparent"" dramatic quality. His ability to ""capture"" the character of his subjects has less to do with Mr. Lozoya's ability to capture personality or ""character"" and more to do with taking advantage of his subjects -- the battered faces of the homeless, blind, handicapped, legless, toothless people. Otherwise Mr. Lozoya resorts to cheap theatrics of make-up, masks, horns, ridiculous dramatic poses, props and even fake blood.For the publisher to publish Mr. Lozoya under it's ""Masters Series"" is deceiving and insults the true masters.If you want to master black and white portrait photography study the portraits by Yousef Karsh."
5,Now I hear the sounds clearly,"I enjoy using this to listen to music. The earphones delivers clear and full sounds. I now can hear sounds that I missed using other cheap earphones. The ear pieces are heavy in comparison, but they fit comfortably. It doesn't block outside sounds completely. It works for me that I can notice noise or other activity that requires my attention."
2,MESSERSCHMITT,"FOR ALL PRACTICAL PURPOSES THIS IS A TOY---NOT FOR SERIOUS COLLECTORS. THE DETAIL IS QUITE GOOD, EXCEPT FOR THE RADIO ANTENNA WHICH IS A PIECE OF STRING WITH TWO SLIP KNOTS HOLDING IT ON. IT IS PLASTIC AND MUCH TOO LARGE (1:18 SCALE) I SENT IT BACK."
5,Great product,Very happy to have found this adapter for my daughter's game system. The price is good and the shipping is fast. Thanks so much.
4,Very Hot Soft Porn,"This one is very Hot! It has some very good looking young women in it. The scenes are tastefully done, for the most part. The only disappointment is the girls stop what they are doing just as its getting good! As in there is very little if any pink shown. Other than that its a pretty good video and one of the top ones in my collection.I would recommend this one to any one that likes the Soft Porn. If your into the Hard Core stuff you won't like this one."
4,Good Deal!,"I read this book some time ago and enjoyed it. I found it to be a smooth read with its vampire, Karl Braun, a vampire having little use for mortal humans. Pain is his game and he knows it well. Good book."
4,Good for now,"I brought this case mostly to have something to protect my iphone 4 until a better case comes out. The case fits, but there's a slight gap at the top due to the lack of room provided for the power button. The case does offers a better grip and improved signal strength however. Since there are just a few iphone 4 cases out there, the price is a bit steep for the quality it is."
5,Exactly What I Wanted,"This is exactly as described and exactly what I wanted. Fits my iPhone 4 perfectly and now even my husband wants one, so we're about to order a second. Good job."
3,Good but could have been better,This book was good but not great. It could have been longer and it could have had a little more action in it. Its pretty dumb how Bill put marijuana in his duffle bag just because he sucked at football and Scott was better than him. You don't plant drugs on somebody just because they are better at something than you. This book could have been better than it is.
5,Awesome Album!,"Crucible - ""My Heart Is A Merciless Piece Of Metal And Fire Is Highly Enjoyable Heavy And Chaotic Stuff! Hard To Explain Really! But If You Like Heavy, Chaotic, Double Picking Stuff With Awesome Growling Vocals, Check This Band Out!"
4,Nice blast from the past,"I had this record years ago, then spent many years looking for a replacement, to no avail. It was great to find it available thanks to Amazon. Radio seems to think The Guess Who only recorded a few songs, so its good to hear them outside their AOR contemporary box. Heartbroken Bopper really captures Burton Cummings' intense vocal style, and sounds like no other group. Get Your Ribbons On has a great boogie woogie feel, and I still remembered Running Bear almost verbatim. Back to the City is one that stays in your mind for a long time after you hear it again. This record is worth every penny!Rockin'"
2,HOHUM HORROR,"As with most Rick Hautala books, SHADES OF NIGHT suffers from being overly long and padded with redundant introspective narrative and a lack of sustained suspense. Although Hautala has good plotting, his excessiveness tends to diminish their impact.In this rather tedious story, a young woman recently married finds herself stalked by a mysterious man; nightmares of an unknown woman beckoning her to a secret in her husband's cellar. A rocket scientist is not necessary to figure out what is going on, and the main character, Lara, becomes too whiny and self-pitying to become empathic with.Labored and derivative, it's not one of Hautala's strongest entries."
3,"Lot of theory --Poor coverage in topics like swing, awt etc","I bought this book , thinking that this will be another master pice from wrox like Professional ASP by wrox , surprising it is not.This covers lot of theory , you should be very patient to read this .Fisrt few basic chapters of basic OOPS covered well as well JDBC , but the AWT ,and swings are really bored , he made it a bit tougher ... I suggest reading patrick Naughton of Complete refrence java ."
4,Reasons why you'd want to read this novel:,"* It is completely written in e-mail format -- thus, making it an original read.* It has a little bit of everything -- romance, humor, mystery, New York lifestyle, flaky supermodels, etc.* It has insightful elements of chick lit.* It is an overall witty, romantic romp.Written by Meggin Cabot, the author of The Princess Diaries, The Boy Next Door is one of the most endearing and funny novels I have read in quite a while. I devoured it in one sitting. I couldn't recommend this gem enough!"
5,Another Keeper For Me!!,"When I first saw this book a while back I was at the book store, I had picked it up and I almost bought it but then had second thoughts on buying it, what was I thinking! This book was recommended by Kelly from Regis And Kelly, I was still having second thoughts on reading this book, only because it was an Email format, boy am I so glad that I gave this book a chance, I couldn't put this book down, you know how you can't wait for the next chapter in this case you couldn't wait for the next Email :) I loved everybody in this book, they all made me smile laugh out loud. It is a must read you won't be disappointed, there is going to be a sequel I can't not wait if I could give this book 10 stars I would I think it deserves more than that, could you tell I loved this book!Happy Reading Lisa"
5,Awesome Book,This was an amazing book. I couldn't put it down. it was soo funny and interesting. Lots of romance with a little who done it in the background. I couldn't stop laughing at some of the charcaters antics. Mind you these are supposed to be grown adults who can hold steady jobs but can't figure out their love life.A MUST READ!!!
2,don't waste your money,"I will admit that the major reason that I bought this book (FULL PRICE, MIND YOU) was because Kelly Rippa's picture was on the front..so, I am thinking that this must be good. The whole email concept was unique and I thought it would be interesting.***WRONG***I know that this was suppossed to be a ""fun"" book, but I found it very difficult to connect to any of the characters. There were about 10 different plots going on at one time. You could be reading a current email between two people and then on the next page is an email answer from 10 pages ago...I found it very hard to follow and just plain boring."
5,Review of The Boy Next Door,"At first, I thought that the all email text would become boring.However, it was so charming and interesting, that I loved it.A must for all emailers!"
5,Great Book,"A friend recommended this book to me. When I first started reading it I thought it was rather weird - as the entire book consists only of e-mails back and forth between characters. I was soon hooked, however, and absolutely loved the book. A quick, easy, light read that I would highly recommend."
4,Not half bad...,"My 18 month old likes to sit on my lap and watch as each activity cycles through. Sometimes Kermit adds narration, but I usually provide information, such as when it goes through colors, I name different objects that color or say where the animals live. I just started putting it on level 2, so he can practice clicking the mouse and he loves it even more. The game really keeps my son's attention and he usually gets bored quickly with everything but his books.The major downside is Kermit's narration and the songs. You have to click a bunch of times to get Kermit to talk about the objects and not even always then. Also, the jukebox section, when Kermit sings, he is seriously off-beat. The music and his voice don't match up. I don't think the programmers had both running at the same time when they made this game and it sounds like it. Also, the music for the songs is too club sounding. The games are good, just not the jukebox."
2,Danze D461025 3-and-1/2-Inch Downpour Showerhead,"Unless you have TONS of water pressure, this shower head is useless. We have decent pressure and the water sorta dribbles out. I had a similar $15 unit I bought at Lowes that worked a lot better than this one.It's very well made and all but I like more water hitting ME in the shower than the shower floor."
4,Cobra Bridge,"""Jo, Zette and Jocko"" was a series of five comics Tintin author Herge wrote for a younger audience. Plot and style are simpler, with more gags. It features a family and their pet monkey. ""Valley of the Cobras"" (1957) was the last one Herge finished. Worth a look for fans.Jo, Zette and Jocko the monkey are skiing in France. They get in the way of the Maharajah of Gopal, and throw a snowball at him by mistake. He demands an apology, and tracks them down to their home. Things are sorted out, and the Maharajah, seeing engineering blueprints in the house, hires Jo and Zette's father to make a bridge over the Valley of the Cobras back in his own country. Dad takes Jo, Zette, Jocko and his wife with him. Not everybody wants the bridge, and sabotage follows..."
3,NOT WHAT I WAS HOPING FOR,This book starts out well. I had great expectations and was sorely let down. The spelling mistakes and wrong names used through out the book drove me crazy. You were unable to tell who was talking to who in some parts of the book.
1,Indian Warriors,This item was NOT available. Disappointed that items are advertised which are not available. Yuck!
3,Watch with Date,"This watch is a nice watch but unfortunately it is very difficult to read the date as their is no space around the number.The reason I bought the watch is because I wanted a nice dress watch with a date at a reasonable price, I should have listened to a previous review warning of this problem."
2,"Great performance, but quality of early FM tape detracts","The encore at this performance is practically a religious experience (like, 24 minutes worth). Unfortunately, this is a tape of a commercial-free FM broadcast (the mighty MET?, KLOS?) from the Roxy on Sunset strip. Someone out there must have a higher quality tape - this was recorded too loudly."
1,Buyer beware - NO singing on this album!,"The cover tricks you and makes you think it ""includes 6 music tracks"". Nope. None at all. No singing at all! Big Kelly fan here, but I was expecting the music - it even lists the 6 songs. Good grief!"
5,Hear Me Out,"I haven't watched this thing in it's entirety yet, so as of now, I have no complaints. The segments I did watch looked very interesting. I love documentaries and learning about people I admire and this was a good buy! Kelly Clarkson has always been very intriguing to me and it's really nice to learn a little something about her!"
1,i've got home movies more interesting than this,"Big Kelly fan. What a voice! Rivals Christina and Mariah. BUT...you really don't get to hear it. As many have mentioned, it would appear that there are videos to the hits on this DVD but instead you have a random clips sandwiched between the same dang black&white; cut scene throughout featuring about 3 seconds of Miss Independant.It's good to know that Kel hasn't let the glam of the spotlight swell her smalltown head but I get enough of this nerdy babble in my own burg.Then again, maybe the target audience consists of tweens and teens who can't wait to grow up and go camping and bowling without parental supervision. To those of us who can, this is a very sleepy insight to the world of a superstar. Maybe for some real excitement I should've bought Paris Hilton's home video (ha)."
1,WHERE ARE THE MUSIC VIDEOS?? MAJOR RIP-OFF,I really feel that the advertising for this DVD is Deceiving! They advertise this DVD as having 5 Music Videos but there are NO MUSIC VIDEOS! I dont see how they can get away with this! I Love Kelly Clarkson and Think that she is one of The Greatest Vocalist Out there today but I am VERY DISSAPOINTED with this DVD!
2,Not an honest translation,"There are instances where the translator includes things which Ibn Ishaq had not written about, and he does not, as mentioned earlier by someone, clearly demaricate this. For example, the entire section about the Satanic verses is no where to be found in the original Arabic work, yet it somehow is in the English ""translation"". There are other such descrepancies, so the reader should know that some of what he/she might be seeing is external to what Ibn Ishaq wrote."
3,missing words are a major pain,"As many others have noted, the Kindle edition is missing a huge number of words. Usually you can guess, but it's a major distraction. Swell book anyway."
2,Just OK,"While admitting its shortcomings, I was a fan of the Chtorr series. I decided to see what else Mr. Gerrold has to offer.The sci-fi elements of the book are excellent. The faster than light travel is explained in an especially imaginative way and the ships are described in detail.Unfortunately, I must agree with some of the other readers in that the characters are not multifaceted in any way. Some characters include the engineer (who really wants to be Scotty from Star Trek), Brik (Worf from ST:TNG), and ""the Bad Guys"" (any of the evil Klingons).While I really wanted to like this story, I found myself distracted by the cliches. Characters were introduced and killed (much like the random guy on the away teams) and the other characters would say ""Oh, well"" *shrug*. The story was just too close to a really bad Star Trek episode for me to be entertained."
3,It was only ok,"The book was good but not the best reading, it also should have been proofread before printing there were hundreds of spelling and grammar mistakes."
2,Terrible ebook quality,"Read this book a long time ago, and decided to purchase the Kindle Edition so I could enjoy it once again.It's still a great story (four stars), but the Kindle Edition sucks (one star). Many, many, many sentences are incomplete or missing words.""My crew was expecting me to be their new captain [AFTER] the disaster."" ""It's wrong to punish [US.] You..."" ""...up to fail. [HAD] enough failure..."" ""There were [NO] survivors.""On and on and on. Terribly distracting, and a terrible job of converting such a good title to ebook format."
5,very exciting,Could not put it down. Very interesting chacters and a rather twisty plot. I am a new fan of this writer.
5,Works well with Genesis 2,"I don't understand what other reviewers are complaining about. I received this power adapter, plugged it in to the console, plugged the other end into the wall; and it worked. The power specifications on the adapter are exactly what the Genesis 2 requires to run. The socket fits nice and snug into the back of my Genesis 2, and I have had no problems with it so far. I did buy mine from Amazon though, and maybe other sellers don't sell the same product as advertised."
1,"In a battle between Superman and The Hulk, who might win???","Dump story and the only thing that this book is good at, is at answering the eternal question. In a battle between Superman and The Hulk, who might win??? The answer is inside this book. some good battles, but with no good purpose."
4,Simple. Perhaps Zen Like.,"This is a very simple book. It consists of cutouts of construction paper. Each page looks like a small project for Kindergarten through second grade. However, I loved it. I am currently spending a lot of time thinking about composition and emotion in photographs. This book helped me clarify and elucidate some key concepts. Neither my wife or daughter thought much of it, though. If your expectations are right ... then enjoy. Think of this as a yoga session with a new teacher."
1,Poor Quality of Rubber,"I am not a complainer, but feel that you need to know about the inferior quality of this product. I have cerebal palsy and walk with small aluminum crutches. I recently purchased a dozen 5/8"" quad cane tips. On October 2nd I put on the first pair of tips to try them out. Shortly thereafter, I noticed one of the tips had split on the side and completely broken off. It is now November 2nd and I have had to replace at least four tips because of breaking or splitting of the rubber tip. The durability of these tips is critical to my safety and I am disappointed that these do not serve my needs in a better fashion. I have also left a voice message on the manufactor's (DMI) customer care help line. I realize the quality of some products in the world today is diminishing, but this quality or lack thereof is ridiculous."
4,So far so good.,Works like advertised. Eraser is a little small and the black top is hard to keep on once you take it off. Other than that I like it and it does what I need it to do.
4,Excellent Cross,"Excellent and well presented cross, they still have a good quiality and best stylus for pens."
4,Very well written experience that is truely touching.,"This is the true story of a sailing family, shipwrecked in Alaska, in unsurvivable conditions, that seemed to get worse at every turn. Elmo Wortman does an excellent job of putting this experience to paper. He makes you feel what he (as well as his children) are going thru. A truely miracleous event that tugs at one's heart-strings, makes you mad, brings you to tears, and certainly won't leave you unaffected once you've read it.(This review has my CORRECT email address)"
4,Best Karaoke version,"I have 3 different RENT Karaoke sets and I found this one the most faithful to the original Broadway orchestrations. The backing tracks are good, but the tracks with vocals leave a little to be desired. I just wish there was a karaoke disc with more songs, like a complete ""La Vie Boheme"" or ""I Should Tell You"""
2,Very Mediocre Book,"If I was looking for a book on Meditating, Zen, etc...I would have simply bought a book on those items. Being a North Dakota native I would much rather read a book on Roger Maris anyday.It wasn't a terrible book, but it wasnt great either. The only thing that kept me interested was how MJ and Scottie took to Phil's different philosophies. I haven' read any of his other books, but maybe they are a little better. I would highly recommend reading Rick Majerus' ""Like on a Napkin"" over this ""overhyped"" book. I guess if you are into ""spiritual"" type stuff you may enjoy the book. Phil has definetly been pretty darn succesful so I guess he's doing something right!!"
4,Great book,I love basketball and to read about it just makes me even happier. Great book for those who love the game or someone who could use a different view on life.
2,Unnecessary vulgarity,"I was intrigued by the online reviews about this much anticipated title and I was very excited to order this book for my husband. The book offers a thrilling plot if you like psychological thrillers. However, upon reading the first chapter I realized how much Carrol uses harsh obsenities that could be deleted altogether without jeapordizing the quality and likablity of the novel. I was very dissappointed about this unnecessary language and it goes against Christian integrity as well as any good moral standard. Carrol offers a very interesting and novel, however I feel that Carrol will lose many prospective customers because of this unnecessary language."
3,Where did the Kindle version go?,I read the Kindle free sample last night and liked it so today I tried to buy it and it's gone!? What's up with that?
1,This Emperor Has No Clothes,"I was speechless when I found out that this novel, which starts out as an intriguing, surreal mystery, devolves steadily into an ending which is both idiotic (space aliens and God) and disgustingly sweet in its moral (appreciate life at every stage of your growth). Carroll is supposed to be this great fantasy writer who has a cult following. All I can say is, keep them away from me! Too bad a writer with Carroll's talent has written such a convoluted stinker. I plan to avoid all of his other work like the plague!"
2,Just look at it...,"The only thing we want out of our controllers is for them to be comforting and for them to be responsive. As long as there's no problems with the controller, it should be all good. Right?Well it seems ""Innovations"" never put more than 2 seconds worth of thought into this controller. If you just look at the picture, you'll notice the cord comes out the left side of the controller. Yes. The left side. You know... where your hand is supposed to be...This, to me, was the only reason why it sucked. Go to any NES controller and look at your hands, if they go above the D-Pad, DON'T get this controller. You'd be better off using a plain Nintendo controller, this one little annoience will get more annoying with time.And I gave it 2 stars cause it is functional. But Nintendo controllers... are better."
5,Good nintendo Controller,"I like this controller very much. Like the review above, be sure to buy the Nintendo brand. No one beats Nintendo."
5,1 word AMAZING,"This game is the giant of video games it stand out from the rest in almost every way, this game is also close to perfect or as close as we will get for a long time. I have been waitin for this game for a while and it was well worth the wait. Even though i was no fan of morrowind or 2 many other fantasy rpg's this game is probably the best game ever made for any console. It realy shows what the the 360 is capable of and shows u its power and is truely a next gen title. As i can see many others agree with me seeing the good reviews and talking to others about it ,all i can say is if you have it get others to buy it and keep the hype up about the game , and if you dont whats wrong with u? buy this game 2 DAY! U will be very happy you did."
4,Thrilling Taste of German Culture,"I thought this movie was great, contrary to the other review. I thought the plot was well planned out and as for missing links, I thought the exact opposite. I think they connected everyone's lives from the past to the present perfectly. The scene with the test run and the music played was fantastic."
4,"Good deal, but be careful","I saved $20, so some of the trouble was worth it. However, make sure that you have a Vue center near you, and it took about a week to get here."
3,Pollini Conducting and Playing Mozart,"For this cd Pollini conducts the Wiener Philharmoniker and plays Mozart's 17th and 21st piano concertos. Both of these performances are elegant, and fine performances. I personally enjoy other versions of both concertos, but in particular Deutsche Grammophon has a version of both the same concertos with Géza Anda and Camerata Academica des Salzburger Mozarteums. I prefer these versions better overall, but if you are a Pollini fan you will enjoy these performances for sure."
2,Great... except for audience noise... ugh,"The title says it all. This is why I hate live recordings with audience. Several times in both concertos you can clearly hear people in the audience cough or even sneeze. I've listened to both several times and it's not that frequent, but even a few times is too often. VPO and Pollini are excellent, of course, and at this price, it's still a must buy."
3,Not quite what I expected,I was expecting more detail and less overview. My fault for not researching it more before buying. The book feels dated and needs an update.
1,My kids: this video has too much talk!,"First of all, only half of the two videos on the 60-minute DVD is about jet planes; the other program is about ships. My kids found both videos boring. ""Why is there so much talk?"" was their constant question! A big problem from a parent's perspective, other than too much talk that's incomprehensible to anyone under 12 or 13, is the actual clips are poorly shot and edited, making it very difficult for a child to grasp what exactly is a jet plane and what makes it fly. My kids didn't like this DVD at all."
1,Shimano Solstace,"I own 6 of these models.I bought 2 more and they changed the design.They now have created a real piece of junk.Most all the time the bail won't close by itself when turning the crank.If you use a bobber stop on your line once it goes over the roller there isn't enough clearance to go past the trigger.Have to take trigger off and file the bottom to give it more clearance.Great improvement Shimano,keep up the good work! I'll never buy another Shimano product again."
5,Sacrificial Peace Making Transformation,"Families of the five modern day martyrs following the vision and sacrifice model of the PEACE MAKER GOD MAN in their sacrificially serving the desperate Waoranis results in Steve, son of martyred Nate Saint, becoming a cherished member of the Waorani family. The heavenly host provides heaven's musical seal of redemption and eventual transforming power of the Word in the lives of savages into child-like faith and humility. Steve, the son and his wife endeavor to assist their Waorani family to cope with intrusion of unprincipled modern thieves and deceivers."
3,Review By Joshua Inman,It was a good book but I was disappointed that it wasn't the story that was in the movie. It did talk about the events in the movie but it basically picks up where the movie left off. I figured that since it had the same name as the movie it would be the same but it wasn't. It was a good book and I probably would have enjoyed it more had I known before I started reading it. I would highly recommend it to all. The movie is one of my favorite movies of all time.
4,Good game,"For anyone that said the sucks...scratch them-scratch their opinion-and scratch their Review!Just as good as the other two games. The only two faults would be that You get lost easily(Jungle-of course you will)and the Insane bosses is kind of a let down(The fear VS. Vamp-Vamp would win) Otherwise Buy it. It has, I believe the best storiline out of the three and very good music."
1,My letter to Hideo Kojima (if I ever made it),"Dear Hidio Kojima,Hideo Kojima can you PLEASE stop putting sexual stuff in Metal Gear Solid!!!!!! We all hated naked Raiden in MGS 2:SOL, most of you liked cambells niece whatever her name is in her underwear in MGS:TTS, and now Eva's Bra is sticking out (most of you will love it I bet). I am 12 years old, I play Socom 1 and 2, and I want to get into Metal Gear Solid, so Hideo Kojima can you please take out all the sexual stuff in MGS. Thanks."
5,Best game for ps2,I own the first Metal Gear Solid and the second. I bought this game the day after it came out. I loved the jungle scene and catching food. I played through the game and just thought it was amazing. The graphics are beautiful and the story is awsome I think this is the greatest ps2 game ever.
5,BEAUTIFUL CHRSITMAS,"This has been a superb (great-seller) in Brasil in regrads to Christmas music; and this version in Spanish is gorgeous.I like this version in Spanish better because Simone's voice sounds way more sultry in Spanish than in her own language; and the only cut kept in Portuguese is that super hit by Roberto Carlos ""Jesus Cristo"" wow!!! that cut alone is sufficient to make this a must have for Brazilian music lovers. Merry Christmas!! Feliz Natal!! Feliz Navidad!! enjoy Simone and the Holidays."
4,Growing Up Spiritually,"WOW, this book is so very on point with how my walk as a Christian is, was and most likely will be. I thank God for the messages backed up with scripture and simply put for any Christian in any position in their walk with Christ. I highly recommend this book for any Christian but especially a new born in Christ... Amazing food for your spirit"
5,Inspirational & Motivational,"This book is the answer to any obstacle we may face in life. Our journey on earth is one that is challenging, and anyone who reads this book can find the strength, inner peace, and faith they need to walk with God. I highly recommend this book to everyone I come in contact with."
3,"GOOD, BUT NOT AT ALL EXTENSIVE","I would have to say, having been a sannyasin myself for the past 2 years, that this is a pretty good book on OSHO and his teachings. Written from an initiates stand point, this is a deeply heartfealt journey into the Master-Disciple relationship. Although I enjoyed this alot, I wouldn't say that it is extensive...however, how can you put into words that which is beyond all form. If you are new to Rajneesh, or not, either way...this book is worth it!!!"
2,Yucky smell and thickness,"I got this oil because it was so highly rated for its antibacterial and antiaging properties. Intended to smooth in on myself. I cannot stand the odor.Smells like bad body oder, musty clothes or something so I have not used it as intended. I wouldn't waste the money to buy it. If you can stand the smell of tea tree oil, purchase that instead.Did not work on athletes foot fungus."
1,Superficial heroine,"The main female character of this story is an incredibly superficial woman. There is no depth to her, she is just flat. I didn't like the heroine so I hated the book."
3,A fantastic book in need of a fantastic editor,"The story is a true delight, and I keep envisioning Ray Harryhausen animating the fantastic creatures, but it's distracting to keep running into punctuation and grammar errors, and the occasional clanger, such as horses snickering. They nicker, though they may be snickering to one another.This could be cleaned up and made into a remarkable series, or a movie script.After all, what's not to love about giant aquatic scorpions that are big enough to ride - if you dare..."
2,katana,"I got this as a gift, its too thin for me. I""m not into the credit card sized phones. Picture quality sucks, its hard to manage it. the menu buttons are inconviently placed, such as the My content and the address icon should have been switched around for better handling. its such a hassle to plug in the earpiece plus the connector to the phone!"
1,do yourself a favor and don't buy it,this bookcase is the worst product i ever bought. the wood (is not hard wood)is so weak that it broke in the delivery and when i opened it surprise surprise. it was a waste of money and time. I'm still waiting for the refund by the way. so buyers you are now warned of this trap.
5,It's the beatles!,"I got this for my wife who is a bigbeatles fan. If you are a fan and you want to have the movies that they were in as part of your collection, you need to get this DVD. I gave it 5 stars because it made my wife very happy."
4,Cute!,"So cute! This movie is a light-hearted classic! If you love the Beatles, you'll get a kick out of this film. Great music & fun characters make it a fun, easy-going, good watch."
1,"""Alive""",Go P.O.D way to live for god. I live for him myself. God bless everyone. I love this song. everyday is a new day i am thankful for every breath I take I wont take it for granted so i learn from my mistakes its beyond my control somtimes its best to let go whatever happens in this lifetime so I trust in love.
4,Good product just don't buy from Nutricity,"Purchased this product from Nutricity. Obviously a bad batch as it was very runny. Nutrcitiy said they could not return, replace as I had already opened the package. How would I know it was bad if I didnt open it???Contacted Shikai directly as package sez Satisfaction Guaranteed. They promptly sent me a new tube. I will make a point not to give Nutricity my business in the future."
3,So far so good...,"This is a hard item to provide a review, since it will take a while to see the results. But so far a good item."
2,A book about drugs. Un libro sobre dorgas.,"(excuse me for my poor english! I read better than I write.)Despite what the author says, this book is about the interpretation of the minds behaviour under the drugs influence.In other words, if you want to read about how the author interpretates what people think and see when theirs brain are actually under LSD, read it. Perhaps you save money if you ask after the book at the local libray.----Contario a lo que el autor dice, es un libro sobre la interpretación de ell actuar de la mente bajo la infuencia de drogas. En otras palabras, si quieres leer acerca de como el autor interpreta lo que la gente piensa y ve cuando tiene el cerebro influenciado por LSD, lee el libro. Quizás salvarás el dinero si buscas el libro en tu biblioteca local."
2,"Very disapointed, considered very ripped off.","Not worth 198 bucks at all. It is a pretty watch, I got a lot of compliments for it. If you look closely at the watch the Roman numeral 4 is IIII rather then IV. Seriously, how could you get that wrong! That's a blatant mistake and devalues this watch completely for me. Check out the photos on the site, every shot you CANNOT see the mistake b/c they KNOW its there and they do not want to show it. Once you get it and you see it, its a huge disappointment. A watch that's SUPPOSEDLY 600-700 bucks should not have such errors."
2,Watch for children,"A watch is too light to be made of st. steel, or steel is too thin. Looks small in the hand. More remind an fake what original. 'One of fixative string-courses on a small strap appeared half torn. Impressed with a box of watch, looks like a box of expensive jewelry, but I still bought the watch and not a box ..."
4,Native animal stories,"This could have been a much longer book, since there is an almost endless number of Native American stories dealing with animals. Bruchac made a good selection, though, and the stories of a wide variety of North American native peoples are represented here. All of them show the importance of animals to the Native Americans in that they are central to creation myths, as well as tales of friendship and those providing numerous survival instructions. Bruchac kept the prose simple, making this book ideal for children. Also useful is the glossary at the end, and the descriptions of tribal nations which provide a great deal of useful information on the major North American peoples."
3,Siren's Song,"Good Jazz music. Reminded me of all the band components that can make great jazz music of the time. The Siren's Song was what I was after, but this version was not what I expected. OK though."
2,Important title but poor copy editing,"* Four stars for the title but only one star for the formatting and copy editing *Although this title is an important historical document, the publishers of this edition have mangled the copy editing. The punctuation and formatting are dreadful -- there's even a mistake in the first sentence. It's a disgrace for such a valuable classic.The publishers have also omitted their details from the copyright page, so I cannot even write to them."
1,"""wrong disc inserted""","I installed the game with the default settings and got ""wrong disc inserted"" just like everyone else. Emailed THQ. Still no response a week later.I wish 0 stars was an option."
3,HArdluck does not want you to buy cook books by Pattie Hensley,"Whoever this HARDLUCK is; he is trying his best to keep people from buying cook books by Pattie Hensley. What is is basic problem? What is he selling on Amazon? He asks if Charles Holcomb from California is Douglas Hensley (Who is a great writer) and Pattie Hensley, who writes cook books. His review is to make sure people do not buy the Hensley's book. It makes me wonder why a jerk would go to this extreme? He mentions how Charles Holcomb uses this book to promote books by the Hensley's but would someone show me a review from Charles Holcomb on this book. Hardluck,... get a life and let us decide what books we want to buy."
1,What a stupid story line,"Ok I have to ask the author what world she lives in.What guy in his right mind would stop having sex because an ex told him he was to small.No American man that is for sure, I hope English men aren't really this stupid.The sex scenes were very choppy and just seemed to be thrown in.The ending was even more stupid where are they going to go after they jump off the boat? Swim to another country? Give me a break. I would have given this book a negative number but didn't have that option.Having been in casinos there is no way this would have worked no matter what."
2,Not a comedy book. Informative but really boring.,"I'm not sure why this seems to be marketed as a comedy book, and I'm frankly kind of mystified by the reviews that found this tome to be hilarious. In fact, most of the preface was devoted to how the author thought that these educational videos were worth more than a ""cheap laugh.""If you're looking for an informative book about the studios that produced these films and a straight, humorless blow by blow description of each scene in various movies, then you might be interested in this. Otherwise, the only thing more boring than watching the films is reading about them."
2,"text informative, gross out pics gratuitous","I enjoyed reading about the different small film studios that produced these films (I loved watching them getting riffed on MST3K). I find Ken Smith's writing more informative than humorous. I also liked all the stills from the ""acted"" productions--some really goofy expressions.However, I had a huge problem with the disgusting photos of mangled accident victims, close ups of eye surgery, etc. This is light reading--including those pictures is just exploitative. The accident safety films could've been discussed without photos so graphic."
1,Over-dramatic and scary,"This book capitalizes on ""shock factor"" rather than fact. The author uses only the most extreme cases and fails to show her readers what a more common scenario looks like. The book frightens victims and parents alike, If you Self-Injure or know someone who does, this book will scare you more than help. Read Steven Levenkron's book or better yet, talk to a doctor."
4,nicely done.,"If you are a cutter, you will be able to relate to many of the stories presented and studied in this book.If you aren't a cutter, you will finally understand the reasons why someone would be compelled to take a blade across their skin, burn themselves, or pull out all of their hair.This stuff is not for the faint of heart.As a cutter (now former cutter) I could relate to a lot of people's stories yet there were also some I couldn't relate to. People self-injure for many different reasons.If you want to know more about this intriguing topic and not by reading fiction, check out this book. It does a fair job."
4,Coasters shake their style up a bit with still pleasing results,"It's hard to go wrong with the Coasters and this album is no exception although stylistically you can see they're (playfully) breaking into territory somewhat outside the traditional ""surf rock"" confines. They dabble with a bit of electronica, do a GREAT cover of the Beatles' ""She Said, She Said"" (I know how it feels to be dead..). All the while we've still got an often mad surf guitar sound going on in the background.. or foreground. It's a short album with only 8 tracks. Purists may nitpick, but there are other Surf Coaster albums that stay consistently true to the surf rock sound all the way through (which they do GREAT - ""Fly Up"" with 26 tracks is a good example of their mastery of the genre). This one has them expirimenting a bit and has it's own benefits, great musicianship and a KILLER album cover art not least among them! Love those hands reaching out from the waves.. Kinda spooky!"
1,Not a film but just text,"When I bought this I thought that it was a film made from de Sade's 120 Days of Sodom (which might have been amusing), but I was ***WRONG***. What it is was the text displayed on your screen. I checked and re-checked the web page carefully, but there was no hint of this.Since I already have it on my Kindle in both English (The 120 Days of Sodomwhich cost $2.99) and in French (120 journées de Sodome, Les (French Edition)which cost $0.00) I feel taken. If a DVD is just pages of text Amazon should tell you. But Caveat Emptor, even when dealing with Amazon."
4,Bermuda Triangle Some Interesting Points of View,I found this documentary extremely informative giving a variety of perspectives on the Bermuda Triangle phenomenon. I had read some of the books on the subject referred to in the DVD and appreciated the opportunity to see all data and current conjecture presented. I would recommend this DVD to anyone interested in exploring the issue.
2,Not his best.,Well written but tell me much more than I wanted to know about Indian mining in the 1800's. The topic is not reflected in the title.
2,An incredibly long and boring essay,I really did not enjoy this book. It was written sloppily and incredibly piontless
2,disappointing read,"I had read the original article in Harvard Magazine when it had been published, and it was quite a good read. I bought the book with some anticipation; however, the book read as just a puffed up version of the magazine article. I agree with the other reviewers who found the book superficial. I'm actually surprised at the good reviews the book in general has received. I would not recommend it, although given how short it is, you won't be actually wasting a great deal of time by reading it."
3,"A Brilliant Tale, Simply Told","Longitude is not nearly as good as it should be. From the rave reviews on this site to the many weeks the book spent on bestseller lists, one would expect it to be an incredibly fascinating, tightly written tale. That it is not. The story itself is interesting...it's amazing to see to what lengths people went to 'discover' longitude and to comprehend just what an enormous problem it was. For teaching us a little bit about the problems of our ancestors, Soebel's paperback is worth the read, just don't expect too much. It is factually rich and does a good job of explaining the intricacies of nautical science to us laymen. In the end, it is the reverse of what the back cover proudly claims: a brilliant tale, simply told."
4,Good for a Curious Mind,"I read this book after someone recommended it to me. It is a book about how the problem of accurately gauging longitude was solved by a clockmaker. It is an interesting peek into England during this time. More than anything though, it is the story of a brilliant, persevering engineer: John Harrison. I would recommend this book to anyone who has a curious, technical mind.Also check out the episode of Nova on PBS entitled 'Lost at Sea: The Search for Longitude'. It is a companion to this book."
3,"Easy, interesting, quick read","For a book that purports to be the story of the ""lone genius"", this one is pretty short of detail on John Harrison's life, but then it appears that the details are pretty well lost to history anyway. It is an interesting introduction to the mechanical solution to the longitude problem and the man who solved it, but it's hardly exhaustive. The kind of book to pick up at the airport if you have an unexpected layover; enjoyable to read, but not so great that you'd feel bad if you left it on the plane."
1,a disappointment,"This is a fascinating topic, with some fascinating protagonists, but at least in the paperback edition (is there a difference?)the author fils to really engage us. The opening chapter is a nice college essay on the topic that basically contains the rest of the book, and I found myself constantly saying ""Hey, you already told us that"" for the next hundred plus pages. There is lots of florid prose about how evil and conniving some folks were, but we never really get a feel for them. I suspect that the author either 1) could have used a good editor or 2) got edited to death in order to fit some sort of page limit. As a result there are lots of teasers & some gratuitous statements (WHY for instance do we have to hear in a one-liner that the man who cleans the clocks at the end of the book had a difficult personal life?)& one walks away wondering what one missed."
4,A Good Little Book About Some Little-Known History,"Until I recently saw a list of books about inventions in the Wall Street Journal, I was completely unaware that there had been great difficulties in developing a method to identify the longitude of a location at sea. Dava Sobel, in this short (175 pages, not counting acknowledgments, bibliography, and index) book, gives a good historical background of the problem and various methods to solve it, and does quite a good job narrating the competition to win quite a substantial prize by developing a method that worked consistently and precisely.I would have been happier had the book contained more about the exact methods used by John Harrison to overcome the various difficulties caused by changes in temperature and humidity and by the motion of the ships themselves. My guess is that the publisher had put a limit on the length of the book that made this impossible."
2,An interesting topic marred by skimpy scientific explanation,"Longitude is a basic introduction to the topic of longitude but the author's journalese style of writing plus her failure to explain clearly certain scientific principles militates against accepting the work as valid history. After reading sections of the book over and over, I still have no idea how longitude is plotted, either astronomically or by Harrison's clock. And I don't think Slobin does either."
2,never gets to the heart of the solution,"A very brief book filled with anecodotes about everything and everyone but the protagonist, Longitude never explains how a lone genius actually solves the problem. Dava Sobel writes poetically and fluidly but NEVER explains how Harrison makes a maritime clock, why it takes him 40 years to build a working model, how the models evolve or what motivated him to do it. Possibly the worst scientific reporting ever."
4,A Wonderful Book,This is a book that I have enjoyed reading and viewing the great illustrations. I have learned so much about a topic of which I knew next to nothing.
4,"A good, quick read about the longitude problem and how it was finally solved","Since man first built sailing ships the greatest problem facing a ship's captain has been calculating one's position at sea. We take this for granted today with GPS navigation, but it was deadly serious for early sailors. Not knowing your exact location meant the difference between arriving safely at your destination or being lost at sea or shipwrecked on some coastline. The scientific community sought to solve the problem by mapping the heavens, but that effort as well as building the tools to leverage that knowledge would take decades of work. This book chronicles the story of a watchmaker who sought a simpler solution to the problem through accurate timekeeping.The author's casual writing style makes this is a quick read, pefect for a plane flight or weekend away."
2,How to make something significant boring,"I found this to be a really drawn out story based on an interesting topic. The concept, the importance of the event, the history leading up to a press for the elusive solution - it is all interesting. Interesting, that is, for about one chapter of a book. This read is so drawn out it made the importance of the discovery feel diluted - like if it was that significant, why try so hard to make it sound important? Overall, a chore to finish this one."
3,A good book for a general view,"You will find this an enjoyable book if your expectations are limited to general discussion and historical perspective. If you have detailed navigational expertise or want citations, technical details and comparisons, then the book will disappoint you.Taken as an object lesson it's quite enjoyable: Mr. Harrison should have demanded the prize he rightly deserved after his first satisfactory model was proved to comply with the terms of the prize. Instead, he made several additional models (the quest, not the attainment, apparently was his goal) and was shabbily treated by the British bureaucracy (which is obviously no different than any other bureaucracy) until King George III intervened when Mr. Harrison was in his old age.Still, a pleasant diversion."
5,Very readable story of one man's struggle against many foes,"I'll try not to repeat what others have said, though I will take issue with some comments.I could not put this book down. I understood all of the technical explanations, but I should admit to a practical knowledge of navigation (I know the difference between WGS72 & ED50).It explained one thing I had wanted to know for YEARS. In Joshua Slocum's ""sailing alone around the world"" (which is essential reading for anyone that liked longitude) Slocum says ""I had no need of a chronometer because I find my longitude by the lunar method"".After reading longitude I know what the lunar method is.The proof of the pudding is in the eating. After reading this book I HAD to go and see the clocks in person, and so I did (you can see the Cutty Sark there as well).I loved the story of Harrison doggedly doing what he knew was right in the face of so many enemies who were so unscrupulous.Buy it.Steve"
3,Adventure story,"This is an adventure tale bordering on a soap drama in reality, with bitter politics and sheer ambition thrown in sharp relief by the author. What this book is NOT is a scientific exposition of the development of the theories behind the measurement of time and the Earth. The book breezes through the concepts of time measurement and instead focuses on the people, their personalities and the stories and tales that surround these lesser known and yet brilliant people, who have impacted the world with their force of ideas and passion."
4,The greatest revolution ever.,This book is great. Sobel uses just the right amount of detail to explain a complex set of ideas and how one man dared to challenge some of the greatest minds in man's short history. John Harrison a man with no formal schooling solved a problem that plagued sailors for centuries and he did it despite the corrupt people competing against him.
4,good punk rawk that is mostly over-looked,"i have never met anybody that has ever really heard of MDC. it baffles me as to why, since they are a very outspoken and obnoxious band when it comes to speaking against the government. Any fan of the Sex Pistols or Dead Kennedys should own atleast one cd by MDC. I have to say my favorite song off of this album has to be dirty harry for president."
2,Hackneyed,"The book lacks originality and boldness, that is required for a post-colonial understanding of the past 300 years of Indian history."
4,So glad I found this book...,because I was looking for a way to make notes while I was reading my books so that I had an outline for the book review when I finished. This book works out great for that. I bought two just in case they decide to discontinue printing the book.
2,Disappointment to me,"Had previously owned Broadway cast version on LP. Compared to that recording, songs on this one have less life and exhuberance, or are overproduced. If Amazon posted samples of ""Hair"", ""Where Do I Go"" or ""I Got Life"" or some others, you could hear the overproduction (more chorus and orchestra, less spirit from the singer). I bought this CD because of the great reviews on Amazon for this version and accusations of bad production quality for the Broadway cast version CD. This one also has a lot of non-musical dialog, which hurts the musical flow. I played this one once and haven't played it since. I'll go get the version I grew up with."
4,Liked It But.............,"The background of being a Thunderbird was really well done and overall I'm really glad I bought the DVD but.......Why, why, why don't the people who make these videos understand that at least half the thrill of seeing high performance jet aircraft, such as the Thunderbirds or Blue Angels, is the NOISE. The aerial footage is fantastic but would have been much better if we could actually HEAR the jets instead of the overbearing music."
2,"Ok, not great","some good footage, but i also have ""Blue Angels: A Year in the Life"" and the USAF Thunderbirds DVD doesn't compare. The Blue Angels movie is a 2-disc set, and covers every aspect of the demonstration season. From initial training, to all the maintenance stuff, etc. The Thunderbirds DVD touches on these things, but doesn't have nearly as much detail as the blue angels one. This DVD has really corny music that plays continuously throughout the whole movie, and the majority of the time it doesn't even fit the scene.If you really want to know about an aircraft demonstration team, get the Blue Angels DVD (and this is coming from someone in the Air Force!)"
4,good read,fast paced and of an old world style. Its kind of like taking a step back through a historic looking glass.
3,SPOILER ALERT - the ending makes no sense,"SPOILER ALERT - Please do not read this review if you have not yet read the novel ""Moonraker.""This review contains serious spoilers.SPOILERS!!!!!!If Hugo Drax has an atomic warhead, why does he need a rocket if he wants to blow up London? Why not just put the warhead in the back of a truck, drive it down the road to London, and leave it with a timer to set it to go off in 12 hours.What's the point of going to all the trouble and expense of building a huge and costly untested rocket to take a bomb up into the air, when the intent is that it will come right back down a few hours' drive from where you launched it?Aside from the fact that building to rocket to deliver the warhead made no damn sense at all, this is a terrifically entertaing book."
3,Wow... What a difference!,"I have always been a fan of the movies, so I thought I would give the books a try to see where to all started and see the differences. For the books, I am going in chronological order (which is different than the movies). The books are much different than the movies, and this book is - by far - the farthest from the movie. The only thing the movie has in common with the book is the title and the names James Bond and Hugo Drax. That is it. The plot is much different and a bit dated - but very basic: bad guy trying to get revenge. I enjoyed the book for its differences, but it was not my favorite book of the series. Overall, if you are a Bond fan you will find it interesting, but there are parts of the book where it drags."
3,Hip Hop Flip Flop,"Well constructed flap book features Emily the bunny and other stuffed friends on an Easter Egg hunt. My two year old daughter loves looking for the eggs in the book. Claire Masurel (who also wrote the fabulous TOO BIG) knows how to contruct a clean child's narrative, but the colors in the illustrations of this book clash with each other resulting in a book that is fun to go through a few times, but not destined to be a classic. For example, the four furry characters are difficult to differentiate so hard to follow through the story. We have the paper back version and I recommend it as a great (non-candy) Easter basket stuffer or prep book for your own family egg hunt tradition, but don't expect it to become an instant favorite."
3,Not compatible with multi-function printers.,"According to the documentation, this device is not compatible with multi-function printers."
1,Not compatible with many printers,"I bought this device and there is nothing in the documentation or easily available on the web site that tells the customer that only certain printers are supported. After trying to make the device work for several hours, I sent an email to tech support who sent back an incompatible list of printers. Most of Multi-function All-in-one printers will not work at all. On top of that, just about all the top brands have printers that do not work. This includes HP, Epson, Canon, Dell, Okidata, etc. While I can understand compatibility issues - these should be explained in detail up front on the web site and on the packaging. Do not buy this device until you can assure yourself that your printers will work."
4,Response to previous reviewer,"This isn't really a review, but a response to the previous reviewer. While it doesn't make sense to you to need a wired LAN connection to configure a wireless device, it does to me. It's using the same approach that WAPs use. You have to configure the device before you can use it, and it's probably cheaper to implement a wired LAN (since it is, after all, a LAN device) than to incorporate either a USB or parallel interface.Thanks for the information regarding the lack of decent documentation. I'm still considering this device, primarily because it supports 3 printers, but will be more cautious and (hopefully) prepared if I do get it."
1,Sleazy and Petty,"This installation of the Gossip Girl series is just as shallow and superficial as all its predecessors are. The entire plot revolves around getting high, having sex, smoking, and guzzling down alcohol. The whole series is pure trash from beginning to end."
2,It's Time to End IT,"When the Gossip Girl books first started coming out, I loved them! They were a quick trashy read, perfect for a summer day. But now that the 9th book is out, the characters and the stories are getting a little old. How long is von Ziegesar planning on post-poning time before the characters start college? The story lines a becoming more and more ridiculous (buying the wedding dress?? uh....) and even the characters who I once loved are now as dull as the plot (I can't stand Serena anymore!) All good things must come to an end- and that means you Gossip Girl!!!"
3,Re-released with New Title,"His new (2007) book, ""Making Mad Toys and Merchanical Marvels in Wood"", is exactly the same, word for word. Either book is terrific, you just don't need to buy both."
5,Great quality,I used this for a musical theatre class when I could not find an accompanist. It was great quality and the kids enjoyed singing to it.
2,SHEER singular NOT sheers!,"It works fine...nothing exceptional, but only comes with ONE so you have to buy two; not such a great deal then."
1,not worth your time,"I felt this DVD was severely lacking in any useful information concerning it's application in hypnotherapy. That being said, it offered VERY basic information about the definition of fears and phobias, just in case no one ever opened a dictionary. I had hoped to learn specific techniques that might be helpful in treating thoses with phobias. I have been a therapist for 30 years, and the information presented in this DVD could be found in any basic reference. I had initially planned on purchasing a few other hypnotherapy DVD's from this individual, but I wouldn't waste my money on another. Don't waste your money."
3,"Filter constructed well, not great for my application","I have a Subaru Legacy GT (Turbo EJ255 motor). This filter worked ok in my application, but the seal did not properly seal causing some oil to leak around the filter. The only other filter I've tried are Subaru OEM filters which have a slightly different rubber gasket on them. There was nothing physically wrong with the filter, I am just not sure if it worked well in my application."
5,Great,"I reviewed a lot of filters before choosing this one, apparently the interior of this filter is much stronger than the cardboard type interiors are used on other popular filters."
5,"A ""voice of reason"" in regards to conventional and alternati","Thought that book presented a ""voice of reason"" in regards to alternative physiotherapeutic (if we could call them that) methods for rehabilitating children that prove to be time consuming and fairly ineffective that they leave the kid with little or no improvement and also make them feel that they weren't okay as they are. I thought Ms. or Mrs. Bratt's comparison of herself to the Iranian hostages was fairly apt, since I could also imagine that someone doing that sort of program could be a sort of hostage to it with what result? That their hopes for their kid weren't being fulfilled and that their kid was made to feel that they weren't okay as they are."
1,I Disagree,"My heart goes out to the mother who wrote this book, but I am speaking up in defense of the Institutes. The members of the Institutes have not now, nor ever claimed they could cure every child who tried their program. I know of no therapy, surgery, or treatment anywhere that does! But for every failure, there are many, many successes. It would be a shame if parents gave up on the Institutes program before they even tried. I feel very fortunate to say that my son's improvement was dramatic after starting on the Institute's program. I am sorry for the boy in this story, however, my son has a much different story. The Institutes saved his life."
4,Great Value,Installed these in my old boat and they sound great. Seem really solid too and the best deal I could find out there. Thanks Amazon..!
2,Couldn't even get started (re-read 2/10),"I have read hundreds of graphic novels, and I saw the buzz on this. I guess I have never been a huge Grant Morrison fan, though he has his moments. This was his attempt to create a completely new universe out of old characters. I tried to get started, couldn't finish. If you are a completest, go for it. There is better stuff out there.Re-readability: 2/10*I always put re-readability in my reviews for people who like to keep their TPB to re-read*"
3,Swingin,"Pawley's Island Original Collection Large DuraCord Rope Hammock, Antique BrownThe picture looks better than the actual product, it is a product of Brazil and you would think that they should know how to make one, right?I'm sure they do and it is fine I was just shocked when I un-boxed it and rolled it out of all the knot ties that were every where. Other than that it works and that is the important part. Did not come with a pillow and you will need one - I purchased two - I'll be happy I did in the cool mornings swaying in the breeze."
4,Worth the price.,"Nice hammock! Looked around, found this one had consistently good ratings. The rope is soft to the touch but durable, the color hides any dust/dirt. A bit on the pricey side, but well worth the money. Well made."
5,Fantastic product,After 30 days. This is a great hammock...seems small at first but it very comfortable holds my wife and I at the same time. We've literally fallen asleep for a couple hours while listing to music as the dusk turns to night. Oatmeal color hides stains. Duracord is soft to the touch and dries quickly after rain. Haven't had critter issues yet. Weaving looks nice and appears durable. Stretch is adequate without becoming a problem. Steel and wood pieces are nicely finished...overall a terrific and relaxing addition to our yard.
4,Product discription,"Brilliant and evil!Thok's plan is simple - convince all the other Piraka he is on their side, and then betray them all! He has the power to bring inanimate objects to life to serve him and spellbinder vision to disorient a foe. If those fail, he relies on his ice peg and ice gun to freeze enemies and his zamor spheres to make them slaves.Includes zamor spheres and launcher!Piraka eyes light up and teeth glow in the dark!"
3,Guide to Birds: Texas,"This is a good little book for quick reference. It is not as good as the larger National Geographic Field Guides for birds for identifying a bird for the first time, since the information and illustrations provided are much less complete."
5,Classic Rock,"One of the 3 greatest albums Trooper ever recorded (along with ""Two for the show"", and ""Thick as thieves""). Great AOR (""We're here for a good time"") balanced with touching ballads (""Pretty lady""), a soundtrack to my youth! A classic album from a legendary band!!"
3,Insightful...,"Rita Marley shares a very insightful account of life with famous husband, Bob Marley.She is open and honest about being his wife and the various events that share her and the Marley clan. I appreciate the stories and the personal photos of the Marley's. Good read...Reviewer: LC"
2,Huh?,I wonder how this book managed to get 5 stars!!! It was such a painful read :oThe girl was just so silly throughout the book! I don't like it.
2,Shangri La Diet Book,"Quite Hokey. It can't be good to be taking spoonfuls of sugar or oil into our system. Definately not something you can do for a life time. Was able to do the sugar for a little while, but it got old very quickly. Tried the oil, and just about lost my cookies. I do think there is something to theunflavorful aspect-but why would you do it with sugar or oil."
5,"Absolutely Amazing, it works!","I just started this diet this week and I am amazed by the excellent results I've noted already. This is by far the easiest, most painless way to diet that I have ever tried. And over the years, I've tried many a diet. The clincher for me was reading about those who had tried the diet and finally had a really good night's sleep, without getting up to snack during the night. Again, amazing. I've been sleeping better than I have in a very long time and no snacking at all, after supper/or late at night.The feeling of calm, of being in control and of finally being able to eat smaller portions and feel truly satisfied is just wonderful. If this sounds too good to be true and waaaay too easy....at least give it a try. You won't be sorry. I certainly am not.Who cares why it works, it works!"
1,Extra light olive oil caused gall bladder attack?,"I tried this ""diet"" for 23 days; I lost no weight and my desire to eat was not lessened in any way. I took 2 tablespoons of extra light olive oil twice a day, and wound up going to the emergency room with my first and only gall bladder attack. My doctor could not rule out the extra fat as being a major factor in my illness and told me to stop immediately."
4,easy delightful reading,"taking a look into the reality love shows, this fun, light reading is a great kindle free book. G.A. McKevert has found a new fan. I like a mystery/crime book that doesn't take itself too seriously. This book is just good escapism."
5,howard st,"i have read the book in find it to be correct, i also meet the author of the book when i was in elementary school. i also come from the place that the book was written about. also one of the characters in the book i know personal. so i must say that book is a very good book."
5,"Simple to install, great in use.","I think Hagaen/Fluval makes great products. I just replaced my hose on my Fluval 405 after exactly one year of use. Really only because I recently purchased a spray bar(Fluval) and a Surface Skimmer(fluval) and from my original install i had cut the tubing too short for optimal operation. Now i've added the extra inches i needed and everything is running tip top shape. Good product, good manufacturer, Great Amazon service and all."
4,Helpful Information,My friend couldn't stop raving about this book!!! The suggestions were practical. The book is well laid out.
2,not exactly what you'd expect,"This product has a very easy security setup, but lacks the speed and range coverage it boasts about. If I had it to do over I'd spent a few more dollars snd done a little more research. Accept for the improved security, this router offers no significant improvements over the less than half priced units!!!! Buyers be ware I very disapointed."
1,Drops wireless connections quite often,"I am replacing this piece of junk. Very easy to set up, and the wired connections work great. BUT, the router has to be reset on average once per couple of days (power off for 30 seconds power back on), to restore the wireless connection.Tech support was of no help even though the forum has pages of people complaining about this problem."
5,been working great for years,"I've been looking for a reason to replace this router with something else but with the DD-WRT firmware this router has been running flawlessly for years, and years... I don't know how long I've owned it now actually, at least 4 years, possibly more. I don't remember what I paid for it, but there's no reason for me to upgrade to something else until it craps out. Rock solid router, good signal, great firmware (dd-wrt)If you can score one of these used but hardly used for 25 hucks, and install DD-WRT v24 preSP2 (Build 14896) firmware on it, you should be good for dirt cheap, with a router that's still very relevant, running wireless N just fine."
4,"Great Linksys product, as expected","Relatively easy to install, and works great. Another good product from the linksys guys.."
2,Weak wireless,"Wired connection is great but I bought this to improve my wireless connectivity. I have the router upstairs (my house is about 3000 sq ft) and I try to use the wireless downstairs. It works great if I'm near the stairwell but if I'm not, it's unstable. More often than not, it's ""very low"" or ""low"" connection or just randomly drops. On the same floor though, it works fine.Update: died 3/2011 so I guess it lasted about 3 years..."
4,Replacment of Dlink,"My old wireless router died after 2 years, so in lookig for a new router i spoke to some people and hit the web for reviews. Many people were of the opinion that the linksys was the way to go as the parent compay is Cisco. Much like it use to be with 3Com. Cisco is the new Crest of networking where as 3Com use to be. So far I like the unit, set up was simple for me as I kinda know what I am doing. I would recomend this item to some one looking for a wirless router."
4,Good Wifi router & switch for the money,"This is not my first wifi router, and I bought it to replace a flakey, four year old D-link unit that needed to be reset several times a day. So far after about a year's use, I haven't had any problems with either PCs or Macs on my home network. The complaints about ""not working with Macs"" are probably due to the user's lack of knowledge, not a problem with the router.I will say the setup is going to be a challenge for someone who knows nothing about networks or WEP security. Setup is done from a browser and there are several screens where information has to be entered to secure the wifi network. If you aren't sure about these, find a knowledgeable friend who can help set it up. I can't comment on Linksys tech support because I never needed to call them."
1,Terrible under load,"I bought it a few months ago to replace my D-Link wireless router (DI-524). I expected longer range and higher throughput. I cannot confirm improvement either in range or with throughput. But I would probably live with that - at least it's not worse. However the real problem is with intermittent disconnections from the Internet under the load. And that's not about wireless connection it's just a basic wired connection. It changes IP every hour or so and that's really annoying. The connection is DSL and that was never that bad with D-Link. I upgraded its firmware, changed computer (WinXP, Core2Duo), changed DSL provider and a modem (of course these changes were planned and made regardless of the router) - nothing helps. I'm really disappointed. Brought back my old horse DI-524 and ditched Linksys."
4,Great Product,"I love my iPod nano, or should i say ""loved!"" I had an iPod nano, the first generation for many years. Recently it just stopped working. I dont know what happened but all of a sudden when i went to turn it on, a black screen with a gray apple apeared then it all shut off. I tried to charge it, i gave it a while, then i pluged it in again, nothing else happened. I didnt try to get it repaired because i wanted an iPod touch now anyway, and the cost to send it in, get it repaired and get it back cost over one-hundred dollars, and may get repaired or not. other than that fact the ipod is great, it has three games pre-loaded onto it, it has lots of room for songs (four GB) and also has exras such as timers and such. It really is a great product. Although some of the latest models of iPods that came out have much more to offer. If you are considering getting one used, make sure it is working proper and go for it. You wont regret it!"
5,excellent,The ipod was delivered somehwere else who knows but I called the 800 number listed and they gave me a complete refund I want to say Thanks Rain.
1,Sinks like a souffle,"I waited eagerly for this book. What a letdown. It should have been subtitled ""Prepare Delicious BREAKFASTS the Night before..."" because there is very little in here for other meals. The recipes seem amateurish to me, too; I'd be bummed if I stayed at an expensive oceanside B&B; and they trotted out turkey and stuffing casserole made with canned mushroom soup (one of the very few non-breakfast recipes in here.)As another reviewer mentioned, the ""night before"" gimmick here just transfers the chopping, mixing, stirring, etc., to the night before. No big timesavers, you're just super busy after you do the dinner dishes, I guess, making ...yet another heavy-French-toast-soak-the-bread-overnight recipe? No thanks. My family really doesn't eat that many egg casseroles or French toast dishes for breakfasts. This book went straight back to the library (glad i did not buy it!) without tempting me to try a single recipe."
3,No vocals,"The description of the album said ""various artists"". I thought this meant various singers. This was various bands or orchestras doing the music, so the marvelous WORDS were missing. The music is fine, but not what I thought I was ordering."
1,I found Ms. Szasz' book to be disheartening.,"Of all the lupus books I have read ( and I have read many). this was the most discouraging of all. I admired Ms. Szasz's tenacity but I found the course of her illness to be terrifying. Her relationships with others sent me into depression. Over the course of time, I have found that books by rheumatolgists with short anecdotes about patients serve my needs better than stories of a single patient's journey."
4,This book has great plays!,This book is Full of great tips from Nba stars and cool pictures too. I wish it was bigger though.
3,Not enough information,"It is a good book, but I was looking for more information on care, some goat psychology, and working with them to do alittle training for behavior. Our goat is a pet, so seeing about eating them, was just something I didn't want to know about."
2,The popularity of ASL owes a lot to this book. . .,". . . However, Joy of Signing does not present ASL (American Sign Lanuage) as much as signed Enlish. This may not mean a lot to many people - signing is signing, right?No. ASL is a real language with its own grammar, syntax and vocabulary. Signed English is not. Signed English is a pidgin language which borrows much from ASL but attempts to communicate in English.Many deaf people will be able to communicate with you, using signed English, but many others will not. Mostly, communicating in signed English has the potential to be akward for all involved, as nobody in the conversation will be communicating in their native language."
1,NEVER USE THEM--AVOID AT ALL COSTS!,I ordered this product and paid for shipping to be around 3-5 business days. It was not until after my order was processed that it said it would be here with in 4-14 days and at the latest 21 days. Not only was there no tracking but I only got 15 of the books by the 21st day and am still waiting on the last 5 books in my order. There is no customer service person to talk to and when I told them how upset I was about the missing books- they said the other 5 were shipped separately. They are a terrible company and no one should use them. I would not have given them any stars- but that is not an option. I could have ordered the books from Barnes and Nobles for cheaper and would have gotten them earlier.
5,The Joy of Signing,A great resource for anyone wanting to learn or brush up on their sign language skills.
4,A Definite addition for any signing library!,"This book is a good tool for the beginning signer, and serves as a handy reference tool. The illustrations are okay, but I agree with an earlier reviewer that an alphabetical presentation of the vocabulary would make this a superior volume."
5,Great book despite damage,"The book was exactly the one I need for the Sign Language class I was taking. They were both damaged when I received them because of poor packaging. I would have returned them, but needed them immediately for my class."
5,The Only Book You'll Need,"This is the original sign language book, and is really all you'll need to be able to communicate with the deaf. Very good illustrations, and well organized."
1,I didnt like it,Smooth Criminal was about some1 getting killed and I'm more into cristian music and i think every1 else should b 2
2,a bit disappointing...,"I was hoping that this book would have more tabular data and formulas for calculating required structural members; instead it outlined basic components of materials of construction (i should hope we don't need an engineer to tell us things are made of wood & steel!) but did not get down how to solve problems. When I saw the author makes his living testifying against people, my heart sank."
3,Is brutal honesty good for adopted kids?,"We are naturally drawn to people or to writing that expresses feelings and thoughts we ourselves entertain but would not have dared to express in public. Jana Wolff's book is of this nature and one part of me admires her honesty, but the other, more important part, believes that if a child can get hurt, then honesty is better left unsaid or unprinted. I have no doubt that Jana Wolff's son has a strong connection with her and that love will guard both against any storms, but one never knows what he will feel when he reads his adoptive mother's book. She'll say: ""That's what I felt at the time of your birth, but you know how much I love you today."" Will this be enough to convince him of his true place in his adoptive family? I am an adoptive mother and would not have wanted to put my child into this situation.Gisela Gasper Fitzgerald, author of ADOPTION: An Open, Semi-Open or Closed Practice?"
2,"Not a bad book, but too mean-spirited to recommend","Ms. Wolf's attitudes toward birthparents are both condescending and rude. Even more than that, they are inflammatory. I cannot imagine how her son will feel if and when he ever reads this book. If she loves her son, she needs to respect his birthmother, simple as that.Wolf's idea of writing the ""secret thoughts"" is not a bad one, but some of the thoughts should have stayed secret. Some of them are too ugly to see print."
4,The Stuff does work!,"Pure Citrimax works for me for the following reasons:1. It is not mixed with massive ammounts of stimulants like caffeine, guarana or ephedrine. That means speciffically that it won't affect my moods or my sleep. Also, does not contain chromium, which can interfere with insulin. No side effects, period!2. It does help maintain healthy weight. This is not a rapid weight lossproduct, but I would say you can loose about seven pounds per month. Rapid weight loss is not healthy!3. It is also a mild appetite suppressant so it helps me eat more sensibly.Just keep in mind that using any diet product should not be used as an excuse or reason to not exercise or eat a balanced diet!!!C.P."
1,Magna-tiles Solid Colors,Our six year old granddaughter loves these solid color Magna-tiles. She definitely can use her creativity when using these tiles. It was her favorite Christmas present along with a set of the clear Magna-tiles. Even her 16 year old sister and grandmother had fun with them!
5,MagnaTiles,"This is THE MOST POPULAR TOY among the little boys in the kindergarten class where I volunteer! I purchased a set for each of my grandsons, ages 2 years 10 months and 3 years 8 months. It says it's for ages 3+, so I know my grandsons will enjoy the MagnaTiles for several years. It arrived well-packaged and right on time."
5,Beautiful!,My fiancé gave this watch to me for Christmas. The picture does not do it justice. An absolutely gorgeous watch with brilliant shine and sparkle. A beautiful design by Anne Klein.
1,Not like the picture,"I bought this from Macy's about 4 years ago. Mine broke, they no longer carry it. The picture is IDENTICAL to the one I have. The one Amazon sent me is not. The crystals around the face are not boxed in like the picture. They are just pushed into the metal. Not anywhere as sparkly. I haven't been feeling good and I don't have the energy to deal with sending it back. If the photo is exactly what you are looking for....don't order this. You won't get it.:p"
2,Pure luck - no resemblance to Catan's strategies,"If you love Catan and want to introduce your kid to board games that have inspired mechanics just like Catan does, look elsewhere. This game is 100% dependent on luck. It is as dependent on a dice roll as Snakes and Ladders is and much more complex to set up and play. So you are better off with snakes and ladders. On the positive side, the game is very well built with beautiful pieces and board. My 5-year old daughter got bored with it right away as did I but at least she uses the pieces to play her own games."
5,Intelligent and profound.,"There is so much more in this book than Gregorian chant (though it evokes in the reader an eager wish to find a group studying the singing of it). Dr. Herbert's sensitive approach touches the texts upon which the chant is based in such a way that they stir into life and open their practical meaning for those who grope their way toward the ""practice of the Presence of God."" One can only respond with deep gratitude."
5,Kline is fantastic!,What makes a Hamlet great is the performance of the person playing the title role. In this version Kevin Kline is brilliant. I taped this performance when it was on PBS years ago and I have watched it many times. It is long overdue on DVD/Video Tape. This should be shown to all students of Shakespeare as the definitive way to perform the part of Hamlet (Sorry Mr. Branagh!)
5,Love it,"Best season yet! Definitely recommend this show and season to anyone that is looking for a not too messy, entertaining and romantic type of show! =)"
5,Can't get enough,"I love this show. I wasn't sure about watching it in the beginning, especially since it was half way thru season 4. I asked on fb and got a few responses, one being "" Best vamp show out there, but make sure to start from beginning so I don't get confused. I remember thinking that's a lot of episodes. After watching the first episode I was hooked. Now I need patience to wait each week to watch"
5,AMAZING!!,I actually bought the first 3 seasons on DVD and finished watching them about 2 months ago and was bummed I couldn't get the 4th season UNTIL I discovered it with my kindle on amazon!! It's perfect and I LOVE it!!
5,Addicting.,Someone told my wife about this show and now we can't get enough. I recommend you plan ahead before you start watching the series. You might find yourself sitting around for hours glued to the tv.
5,Awesome,Such a good series with dreamy characters :). I recommend this series to any sci-fi or vampire addict lol. The main characters really play their parts well.
5,vd,best season yet like being able to watch it when ever I want to and the new episodes aren't available the night the air but that is okay
5,Best Show EVER!,"I would recommend TVD to anyone/everyone, but beware! It is HIGHLY addicting - so much so it should come with a warning label. What a fantastic show!"
5,Addictive!,"This show is just fun to watch, great characters, actors and a great story line. Lots of love to hate and hate to love characters! It's just a great guilty pleasure!"
4,"Love the series, Vampire Diaries for that matter!","The show itself was great. The reason I gave it 4 stars was because I had some trouble playing it on my computer. It could have been my internet connection (cable), not amazon."
2,Joyless just like all previous 9 editions,"The subject is a compilation of wearisome topics, and the authors make sure you pay your dues. No effort was made to reduce the boredom of reading this 805 page text. Also, the font is nice and small and the same color as the tables - a shade of blue. The space between sentences seems to be the absolute minimum.If these issues are handled in the 11th edition, I will probably buy that one. A good and reader-accessible book in this subject can command a large price premium."
3,Great while it lasted,"I purchased this tape measure based on the many great reviews on the internet. I loved the quick finger lock, note pad and pencil sharpener. I didn't like the belt clip which is too small so the tape measure kept popping off my belt. Also, the triple rivet end clip quickly became loose and measurments were off when you measured between studs and transfered the length to cut a block. I liked the black rubber/plastic casing until I left it on the furnace while working in the basement and it melted. The metal tape is fine, but the case is so mangled that the tape won't come out making it useless. I have an old Stanely 35 ft that's metal which is pretty indistructable but really bulky. I would recommend this tape measure to the DYIer who doesn't need precise measurements or for a kitchen tool drawer. I plan on getting another and keeping it away from heat."
4,Otis Redding,"I agree with ""A music fan"" in the other review here. The reason I'm looking at this Boxed set is for the Jimi Hendrix and Otis Redding performances. I've got an old, out of print LP of just four songs from each of them on each side, and I have to say it's outstanding. I wore it out from playing it so much and alas, my turntable is put away in the basement right now.Otis went on stage close to midnight on Saturday night. He got the whole crowd back up on their feet. Six months later he was killed in a plane crash. It's been said the Monterey Pop performance was perhaps the high-point of his career.Throw in The Who and Janis Joplin and this has to be a great deal."
3,my review,"In this sequel from ""The meeting place"", 18 years have gone by and this time the daughters are able, through their faith, to meet and follow their destiny.Again the characters that are introduced in this book are very real and the areas like Louisiana are also very well depicted. The book follows closely the real history of the Acadians. The plot is again very well developed and keeps the readers interested till the end.Good interesting reading."
2,Disappointing,"Total lack of character development, and way too many characters are introduced for such a short book. I can appreciate a dirty scene just as much as the next erotic reader, but this book was just a collection of erotic scenes with no connection or point other than to titillate the reader. A definite disappointment since the back of the book makes it sound as if there is an actual storyline and defined characters who will explore their sexual natures."
2,mmlover7,I had to have this to match my other pink kitchen stuff but it is awful. Have a hard time setting it for just a few minutes. Okay if you set it for hours but not short times.
4,Love Frank,Always have time for Frank no matter what the subject. Can't wait for 'The Naked Runner' to be released on DVD. Must be one of the best spy thrillers ever made.
3,Leather Bomber Jacket review,"The jacket came in very short order, it is exactly as described plus it has the European map lining that the more expensive jackets have. Although the leather is not as fine as the more expensive jackets, it is still good quality for the money."
4,excellent for beginers,"I found this video to be extremely helpful. particularly if you have not made a haunted house before. all the props are easily doable, and he instructions are excellent. I gave it four stars rather than five because I wished that it had been longer"
4,Just take it for what it is...,"Of course, when the title says ""Greatest Songs Ever,"" you need to look at the list of tracks and decide for yourself whether or not you agree. So this is someone's subjective list of greatest songs ever. But it's a fun CD. Kind of a mish-mash of everything, but a good mood-booster."
5,Great item,I'm really surprised at some of the low reviews... good Lord...they're RUBBER GLOVES for heaven's sake! Perfect for the kitchenon Meatloaf Night. 'Nuff said.Dave
1,Number of Gloves Incorrect,I purchased these gloves for our classroom and the description stated 1000 count Large glove but when the gloves got to me there was only one box of gloves 100 count.
5,Great for flu season,"We are being careful during flu season and this helps. Also, use it to make pulled chicken, or take apart the chicken and bones for soup."
4,Girlfriend loves it!,"I got this for my girlfriend because she lost her usual one and has been using her travel one--this one does much better so she says! Very satisfied with the price (but I can't personally say that it works; I haven't used it). Just your run of the mill hair dryer, and it works!"
4,Good dryer for my wife,My wife really enjoys this dryer. All her dryers stopped working after a short time. This one is doing a good job and drying her her in a short time.
2,Extemely noisy,"After reading positive reviews, I orderd this hairdyer. I had a Braun hairdryer that worked like a charm for almost a decade which now needs replacement. I dont want an Ionic Hair Dryer since it leaves my thick hair flat.I was disappointed as soon as I took this out of the box, it's heavier than the Braun I had (too bad they dont sell any hair dryers in the US anymore) and the shape was kind of long. When I turned it on, I found the dryer even in the lowest setting to be deafeningly loud and the air speed wasn't very good. You have to put it on medium of high to even get the temperature to be very warm but the noise was unbearably loud for me.I'm hoping I havea defective dryer and I'm looking forward to trying the replacement Amazon agreed to send me."
2,difficult to assemble,product works fair on thin hair but on denser & curly hair takes an excessive time -would not reccomend for travel or heavy & thick hair. My last revlon was more compact-dried faster-easier for the children to use before school.
2,Somewhat entertaining read for the dressage enthusiast,"The Dressage Rider's Survival Guide has some funny moments, and it also has some somewhat-boring and monotonous moments. Luckily it's a fast read so not much of my time was wasted.For me, a book's worthiness is what I remember about it months later after reading about it, and I can tell you what I remember about this book is that it was a disappointment.If you are looking for an dressage- and adult-themed, entertaining book about a horse, try The Chronicles of the $700 Pony, which made me laugh out loud constantly. I read that book perhaps two years ago, and it remains one of my favorites."
5,Two adult women discover they're lesbians together,"What happens when a thirty-something and a forty-something discover their attraction is more than just friendship? And they live on opposite sides of the country. One is a city girl and the other loves the country. 17 years difference in their ages seems to be the least of the hurdles they have to clear. The obstacles to these two unfold gradually and it's interesting to see how they deal with them. And there are two refreshing points to this book. The first is a woman well in her forties who is suddenly discovering who she is, which seems so true to life. Not every lesbian comes out of the womb realizing who she is. The second is that not everything goes well, again realistic. The love scenes are steamy and the book is a pleasant read. Highly enjoyable."
2,A Solid Attempt at a Decent Mystery,"I have to give credit where it's due- I actually completed this book, so it couldn't have been that bad. However, I completed it with no real interest or passion for the main characters. If the heroine had died, if the love interest hadn't worked out, I would have left the book with the same sense of dissatisfaction which I now have. Mignon, the heroine, might just be a little too beautiful, rich and successful to pay attention to. The story a little too contrived to really get wrapped up in. A lightweight read to carry with you for coffee breaks at work, but not the sort of book to encourage snuggling under the covers with for a long, intense evening."
4,It's the `50s again. WooHoo!,"Imagine the discovery of an unknown album by Buddy Holly or another favorite `50s Rock n Roller. Almost as good would be someone creating something so close to the style of that music that it could almost pass for an original. Well to the lover of `50s SciFi thrillers that is just what has been created in Alien Trespass. All the expected thrills are there, the crashed alien ship, the one-eyed monster, the small town sheriff, even the teenagers that no one believes. Done in a style that is pure `50s.Great cinema this is not - but nor is it supposed to be. What it is is great fun. Get out the pop corn or settle in with an ""all day sucker"" Turn up the volume and have a ball! Its the fifties all over again!"
5,Very Enjoyable - made me smile many times,"I love the cheesy sci-fi films where you think the actors must be in training to be real actors and the storyline is overly dramatized. This film is a great spoof on cheesy sci-fi movies and I think it is very well done. I had a blast watching it and loved the over saturated film with the 50's setting. The acting is really great considering the theme of the movie. If you're not into cheesy sci-fi you probably won't like this film, but if you are I think you'll love it!"
3,Silly,"Oh, my, they could have done so much with this fun premise. Instead, they were so tongue in cheek that it stopped short of being funny and just remained embarrassingly dumb.The producers were trying to parrot the old 1950s-1960s Sci-Fi creature features that were so great when we were kids, but seem so melodramatic now. They could have made Alien Trespass hilarious--but it isn't. It's too nonsensical to be serious, and too serious to be funny."
3,Nostalgic but not entertaining,"Watching this movie, yuo can see that the creative team clearly loves old 1950s sci-fi. This homage recreates the stiff acting and poor plot of those old flicks and it can be appreciated for its loving return to such films.Having said that, the movie is not nearly as clever as it could have been. At the same time as it fondly remembers those old movies, it feels more like watching someone do something he/she is passionate about, rather than inspiring that same passion within the viewer. The wonder and (even cheaply created) horror of space aliens is wholly absent in this film.While the technical and acting aspects of this film are charming as they pay respect to older films, this movie fails to draw viewers in and include them.I wouldn't recommend paying to see this one."
5,Exactly what I needed,The filter basket is exactly what I need to prolong the life of my otherwise good coffee pot. Price was reasonable and the product was new and of good quality.
5,A must read!,"This book is an important look at where abortion rights have been and where they are going, without making judgments about people who disagree. The essays give broad look into the pro-choice movment of today."
4,Beautifullyi llustrated by some very good photographers,"I have mixed emotions about this book. The book is beautifully illustrated by some of the leaders in the wedding field. The tone of the book, though, is often gushingly sentimental, which may be the state of wedding photography today (Try out a fuzzy picture of a bride daydreaming over her SHOES). Still, Hurter tries to present a balanced picture of wedding photographer as it is today - discussing traditional vs. photojournalism approaches and their pros and cons.The pictures are well-worth seeing, but if Hurter's style turns you off, you might be more rewarded by Steve Sint's ""Weddding Photography: Art, Business and Style,'' which also is beautifully illustrated but more down to earth, practical and objective. Better still, read them both and find a balance somewhere in the middle."
5,It works,"I was skeptical about how effective this was going to be, but it actually works! I don't know how, but it does."
3,Worth a try.,"I was curious as to the product. I tried it. I'll keep trying it. I'm not so sure it is working how I wanted it to. I still end up with some underarm odor towards the end of the day. That might be caused by my change into dirty t-shirts at work. Overall, it is interesting and worth a try."
2,Over-priced,Not so good. This item was way over-priced compared to others offering the exact same item. I would not recommend this item to friends and family! Thank you very much!
2,acceptable but a wasted oppurtunity,"The Dalek Masterplan was a massive 12 part Doctor Who epic that was mostly destroyed by the BBC. Only two episodes survive. It deserves better than this. Not that it is badly written, it is just not particulary well written either. It's like reading about the events surrounding The Dalek's plan to use the Time Destructor to conquer the galaxy as reported by the New York Times. Dry and lifeless. So much more could have been done. See the novels The Power of the Daleks or The Mythmakers as examples. Still, it is the only way to experience the story and the Doctor Who fan(and that is the only one who would ever read it) can bring his or her imagination and knowledge of the show along to spice things up."
5,Inspirational,"My husband and I have been practicing yoga for 20-30 minutes daily with the help of this very inspirational book, for two years now. Alhough we haven't actually made it through all 28 days, we are up to Day 16 and hope in two more years we may complete the entire program! The book is wonderful for 40-50 somethings like us, and allows us to work at a comfortable (slow!)pace."
4,Hard work,"This book is probably not good for me to try to do, but his instructions are excellent. He provides enough detail and if you've had some experience in yoga, will be able to do the moves assuming you have the stamina."
1,J U N K - Don't waste your time and money!,"This system seems easy enough to use. I permanently mounted mine to my deck covering after hooking it up and testing it out. Worked great for the first use. Only 3 nozzles worked on the second use a few weeks later. I tried to unclog the nozzles. I was so proud I had them working again after soaking them and then I noticed another not working. After a few rounds with them, I just pulled the whole system out and threw it away. I think if you don't have any kind of hard water and you use these daily, you might have better luck, but in San Diego, don't even bother!"
4,Keeping greenhouse watered,"My greenhouse couldn't do without this automatic waterer, the Orbit Arizona Outdoor Misting System. It reaches most parts and I only occasionally have to supplement the watering."
3,Not as sturdy as I hoped,"These are not the thin paper type, but when it said ""Heavy Card Board Stock,"" I thought they would be the thick, really hard to bend cards. I purchased these for our school's PTO, planning to have a Bingo night that might become an annual event. I think they'll be okay, but they're not as sturdy or durable as I had hoped."
2,Warped,They are very cheaply made - warped and don't lie flat on the table surface - but they do fit with the blocks and allow the light through which is why they were bought
3,great story but needs better editing,"I really enjoyed this story a lot. I laughed and found that I had a lump in my throat at times because of the emotion the characters were feeling. My only criticism is that there were lots of editing errors and that was a bit distracting, at times. Other than that I really enjoyedthe book and I look forward to reading more from this author."
1,stupid beyoond stupid,"This 'film' is unwatchable and unbearable. Who gave this woman the money for this junk The film is confused, bombastic stupid and poorly made. Hello. What a waste of time and money."
2,low quality,"Very disappointed. I bought three, thinking i would give two as gifts. i would be embarrassed to give these to anyone. They look very cheap, are smaller than you would think and the head of it is LAVENDER! Off brand imitation of the one sweep plain brown box packaging. If you want a funny looking broom to give a little girl for her playhouse, here you go."
2,Bum Sweep,"I bought the broom because the demo video really was extraordinary. But buyer beware.1. It does NOT work well on carpet. I have mucho dog/cat hair to clean up, but it wouldn't pick up any. This is the main reason I purchased the broom.2. The ability to use for wet cleaning floors is not especially effective. For one, since it does not absorb, all you do is scoot water around.3. It gets a couple stars because it does do ok on grout/tile.I unfortunately bought it from the dealer direct, paying quite high shipping as well."
1,Poor Quality - Cheap Rubber,I bought this in February and by July the rubber had started disintegrating.I previously had a Sweepa which I had for several years; the rubber never disintegrated but the handle rusted after several years.This product is a cheap knock off of Sweepa.
2,Good for beginners of cooking once a month,There are some good tips in this book if you have never cooked ahead before. I liked the holiday make ahead ideas. The main thing I did not like about this book is that some recipes are repeated up to three times and when you look at the recipe index it does not show that. But it does have complete shopping list for each portion of the book. And the recipes are alot easier then some other freezer cookbooks that I have used in the past.
5,Very informative,I enjoyed this book very much. It is written in a very informative and pleasent way. It also encouraged me to try freezing my food for a month. Thank you!
2,"Nice idea, lousy results","I am single and busy and I need quick and easy meals. After vowing to quit buying expensive deli food, I found this book and gave it a try. Pros: I've spent much less on food, my freezer is still about a third stocked after about five weeks of eating the meals I prepared. The food is easily portioned into plastic bags to throw into a cooler for lunch and dinner at work. Cons: The food is awful. The only thing I look forward to is a chicken soup recipe. The rest of the tomato-sauce-based meals are bland. I would be embarrased to serve them to a guest, especially the lasagna and broccoli quiche. I keep adding ingredients as I reheat the meals to jazz them up. Overall, I've saved cash on deli food, and it's nice to have a hot meal twice a day. But I won't be using the book again."
3,Needs some revision,"My husband and I bought this book because we wanted to spend less time in the kitchen and more with our new daughter. I found the strategies to be useful, but there needs to be a larger range of recipes. I also found that placing the same recipe in different parts of the book to be a waste. Perhaps in the next addition you could add nutritional information (grams of protein, fat etc.)"
2,Disappointed in this book,"I am brand new to freezer cooking.(Cooking at all, in fact) I bought two books at the same time. ""Frozen Assets"" and ""30-Day Gourmet"".""Frozen Assets"" tells you what to eat for 30 days and gives you the recipes. Another chapter tells you what to eat for 10 days and gives you the recipes, Unfortunately it repeats the same meals from the other chapter. If I was going to try to freeze for only ten days I could have chosen my own ten. But the same recipe can be repeated 3-4 times in the book. I looked at the recipes and only found 1-2 that looked appealing to me. I was really disappointed. I wish I hadn't bought it.I love ""30 day gourmet"". It taught me how to adjust my recipes and had 100's of others to choose from."
5,Fantastic!,"What a great book! I finally got my copy yesterday and couldnt put it down until I finished reading it cover to cover! I loved the tips for making cooking day easier, as well as the grocery shopping advice! I can't wait to try the 30 day meal plan! Excellent, a must have for anyone serious about OAMC!"
3,"Good family film, but...","My daughter loved the first 5 books in the Sugar Creek Gang series, and we got this movie for my son's birthday. It is a good family film, and all of my children, ages 9, 8, and 5, have loved it. The film introduces the homelife of Dragonfly and Circus (why did they feel the need to make Circus a girl?), and maintains a lot of the innocence of the books. That being said, however, they also took out most of the Biblical truths, and references to the Gang's Christian walk that were so wonderful in the books. This was very disappointing, and makes it a watered down version of the original. The acting wasn't fantastic, but this seems to only bother me, not my kids."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this because I had recently visited the Mayan Riviera. My home movies were better than this ""professionally"" made product. It's only 12 minutes long!!! What a rip off. You will learn nothing from this. The narration is disjointed and irrelevant."
1,Global Treasures ChichenItza & Tulum DVD,"VERY POOR QUALITY - the length, detail and overall content of this video were more than disappointing. A complete waste of money."
2,"Great show, horrible quality DVD","Pros:- Awesome show. Brings back a lot of great memories.- Unlike the Disney release, these episodes are complete and not shortened to fit on the DVD.Cons:- The WORST quality DVD I have ever seen. Each disc and each episode has this bizarre grainy, distorted, image. It isn't unwatchable if you're a hardcore fan--I'll probably even buy more seasons despite this defect. Also it doesn't matter what kind of a TV or DVD player you have. My tube with cheap DVD player was just as crappy a picture as my HDTV with a progressive scan player.- While the story is intact and not edited down, the introduction and theme music has been cut from each episode. Boo!"
3,"Impressively large ironing area, but","Impressively large ironing area, but as stated in other reviews, it is very wobbly, there is no way to steady it. As far as large area, it is fine but,not always needed. I would never pay that much for an ironing board again, without seeing it first. I do have to say the pad is very long wearing. I do like the pads."
2,Stiff Sheets,"These sheets when they come to you are so pretty, but they are very heavy and hard. No matter how many times I have washed them they don't get any softer. I have a large capacity washer and they fill it up with the queen size. They are just so heavy, I only use them in the winter, not for using here in the Southeast in summer. They do have a pretty sheen to them and they are a very pretty color, just not SOFT."
3,I've had alot softer with 1/3 the thread count,"$60 for a king set you can't really complain i would just add that i was all excited for 1200tc and when i washed them and put them on the bed, they wrinkled and were certinaly not silky soft as i anticipated. On the positive, they are heavy and make my 300tc and 600tc sheets feel as thin as paper."
4,Nice set of sheets,"but keep your iron handy, or better yet take them out to be cleaned and pressed. Feel wonderful"
2,save your money,"I was so excited to buy these sheets as my husband and I have 600 thread count sheets that we love. These, I DO NOT love so much. This is why:1. They are increadibly stiff. I washed them 5 times before my first use and even tried vinegar and salt washes to soften them- it did not work. They are, however, softening as we sleep on them.2. They are so wrinkley!!3. They barley fit the bed. The description says that is fits extra deep mattresses but it is a STRUGGLE to get them on my bed.I just read consumer reports and they recommend that you buy between 400-600 thread count, they contend more than that is unnecessary for a soft, nice sheet. My 600 thread count sheets are much more soft and have very few wrinkles. Dont waste your money, buy something else."
5,Awesome sheets!,"These are thick at first, but get softer and more wonderful each time you wash them."
2,not what i expected from a 1200 count sheet,"This was definitely not what I expected from a 1,200 count sheet. It is simliar, if not as smooth as the sateen sheets we received for our wedding which are probably around 800 thread count. They wrinkle VERY easily. One thing that I did like is that they fit our double sided pillowtop mattress."
2,C.Mullen,"I recently purchased the Queen 1,200 Thread count sheets. I have washed them three times,they are still pretty stiff and noisy. My biggest complaint would be that the Flat sheet should be wider. I find with one person let alone two people under the sheets there is only maybe four inches of sheet to spare down either side of the bed. Even with the bed made you can't tuck in the sides of the sheets only at the foot board.All Queen size sheets that I have purchased in the past where made of much more material.For 1,200 count sheets I find they are not worth the money deal or no deal."
2,"Sweet films, Rotten copies","These films are really sweet and give an excellent opportunity to see ""America's sweetheart"" in four of her most famous ""little girl"" roles. While it is lovely to have any access at all to these films, the transfers are definitely in the budget range. If you can pick this up for $4 or $5, then go for it, but don't expect more than a hint of what the films were really like. And definitely do NOT use these transfers as a model for what silent film is like--it would kill the love before it got started. The maddening calliope music for 3 of the 4 films is wretched: it is much better to turn off the sound and play different background music. Indeed, one is just as well off to head over to the Internet Archive and watch them for free--the quality there, poor as it is, is pretty much the same as on these disks."
2,Nice but the taste blew it!,This is a nice little cooler that keeps the water cold - the problem I had is I couldn't get rid of the plastic taste no matter what I did. I ended up throwing it away!
3,An interesting read at best.,"There was some interesting material about sororities in this book but as a 19 year old college student I found the story mostly depressing. I thought all of the characters were shallow making it very hard to connect with them. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone unless they were looking for a light read. On another note I would like to say I have worked closely with a sorority and fraternity on my campus at a state school and they were both very dedicated to community service, they were nothing like the ones portrayed in this book. So don't let this story deter you from considering pledging in the future."
3,Just Remember!,"This is just a reminder to all women reading this book that are thinking about going Greek during their college years. Pledged is NOT an accurate portrayal of all Greek communities. Robbin's wrote her observations at a specific school, not at all of them. Each school's Greek system is different and unique. (Mine is 100% dry and has the strictist anti-hazing policy in the country.)I did enjoy Pledged; it gave me another perspective toward Greek life. I will definetly recommend it to my friends, both Greek and non-Greek."
4,Worth the read,"Definitely worth the read! I found this book very interesting and at times hard to put down. Even more interesting than the points the book brings up is the reation of 'greeks' to the book.Despite what other reviewers have said the author does an AMAZING job staying objective while following these girls and does not put any pre conceived negative opinions about greek organizations into the book, even after she has been given a multitude of reasons from the girls she follows.I find that the only people who do not like this book are ""greeks"" who are too defensive about their organizations to step back and admit to the reality of sororities' nature and purpose."
5,A must read for parents.,"If you are a parent of a child who wants to go Greek, I urge you to read Pledged. I am the parent of a soroity member and I found this book to be an accurate assessment of what the Sorority system is like, while not villifying them.You probably didn't send your daughter to college without doing extensive research. So, why would you let her join a sorority without first researching sorority life? They will tell you it's all about friendship and charitable work, but there is so much more involved that you should know about.I don't think Ms. Robbins intent is to turn you against having your daughter join a sorority,as a matter of fact, it probably won't. But her book will open your eyes as to what your child may be getting herself into."
3,Very Interesting,"I just got through reading a sample of the reviews from people that had only bad things to say about the subject, the book and the author. I find it very interesting that if this book was so bad, that you continued to read it."
2,??,"An interesting book, however, the experiences of the main characters did not tally with my own at all. I don't know if a)the author was biased, or b)she was accurately portraying the sororities she visited and they just happened to be drastically different from mine and the other houses at my school. Either way, the sororities she wrote about were shown rather negatively. The book would have been much better had the author bothered to look at the sororities in the northeast US and canada, instead of focusing tightly on the south and the west coast. Then she really would have gotten a look at the diversity within the system.I dislike a lot of the implications that historically white sororities emphasize nothing but getting a man- i joined my sorority because it was full of strong, independent women. maybe this is true elsewhere (?) but the fact that the author did not even include a mention of groups like mine makes me think this work is rather biased."
1,Alternative,"I think many sorority members who are interested in reading this book should buy a used copy on-line and share it with fellow members. Personally, I would not want Ms.Robbins to get any profits from this book! I hope no one thinks that these things are prevalent at every school or chapter."
3,Interesting.,"I never joined a sorority in college so I was curious. This book was interesting and very informative. I learned a lot. It got a bit long winded toward the end and I started skipping pages. I didn't read the epilogue or the last chapter because I was just sorority-out.But, it was a good book that I recommend. However, be prepared to dedicate some time to it... it's a bit long."
3,Fluffy beach reading...,"I happened to enjoy reading Pledged--as a work of fiction. Being an alumna of an NPC sorority, I have enough distance to compare some of the women featured to my own sisters. I hope that a young woman who is interested in Greek Life does not read the book and take it as gospel. [...]"
2,Disappointing,"I approached this book with the idea that Robbins was going undercover to give a firsthand account of sorority life. I was disappointed to find that she was simply following several sorority sisters, observing and interviewing. The book suffers as a result.Also, it is not organized well. Robbins moves back and forth from the stories (which are surprisingly boring) of the sisters to her research about themes that arise from the sisters' tales.Her conclusion was didactic and did not fit with the tone of the rest of the book.I have no idea why Greeks are so upset by this book (except, as Robbins points out, that they probably have not read it). It is hardly an expose. I was bored and felt that I wasted my time reading it. Current, former, and future Greeks seem a better audience for this uneven, flat book."
4,Pretty Good Read,"After reading this book, it gives someone like me (non-affiliated) a real look into the lives of sororities. I think that I respect the pressures that sorority women encounter more then I did before. It also satisfied any little caveats of curiosity that I had. I am in the process of founding my own group (non-affiliated) and was researching the group dynamics of different organizations which led to me reading this book. I think that it gave me the pros and cons very succinctly along with a good idea of what to avoid and what to incorporate in my endeavors."
1,Shock-Lit.,"This book shone some light on the horrors of Greek life in college. However, as someone who is *in* a sorority, I think it's more than a bit biased. One sorority doesn't tell the story of all of them and the ""dangerous behaviors"" this book focuses on (conforming, eating disorders, drinking, drugs, ect) aren't part of just Greek life... that's what it's like to be in college now. College-students are faced with those sorts of issues every day, regardless of whether or not they are in a sorority/fraternity. She fails to mention the real connections that are made, the academic excellence required by many sororities, and the philanthropic aspects of the sisterhoods. Robbins should put her energy into investigating something that's really a problem, like the over-whelming acceptance of rape and sexism in our society."
4,The author told it like it is,"If sororities are so great then why don't they let in everyone who would like to join? Why do only people who the sorority member consider to bethe ""best"" people get in? Why do they only select ""Miss America"" types?Why don't they select the ""average Jane"" type who might weigh 200 pounds?""Miss America"" type might be a dud why ""average Jane"" type might have much to offer. It is a matter of judging a book by its cover. They have charitable causes only to get people off their backs who criticie them fortheir snobbery. The people who they rejected could have taken part in the charity causes too."
3,it could have been better and worse,"I just finished this book and I will say parts of it were facinating but others dragged. At times I found myself mixing up which girl was which, leading to a "" who's sleeping/fighting with who??"" the IM messages were just there and I give her credit for stepping into ""uncharted"" grounds but found when she got into secret rituals and stuff she dove in deeply with silly things and glossed over the big stuff. Not a bad book but not something I will read again.... but I am passing it on to a ""sister"" I know"
3,Strong Start not Sustained,"I really enjoyed this book up until page 120. At that point, it became bathroom material, and I only read few pages at a time. The strong narrative start bogged down as Robbins sought to lecture and report her views instead of reporting the action that was taking place. Another thing that held this book back was that the four main players didn't exude likeablilty. It's hard to read a book when you keep asking yourself why the main characters are such shallow, stupid, and vapid individuals.Not really recommended. Rent a copy of Revenge of the Nerds or Animal House instead."
2,Not to be taken seriously,"Being a member of an NPC sorority, I was interested in reading Ms Robbin's book to see if it all mirrored my experience as a greek. The experiences that she wrote about represent ""college life"" as a whole. Besides the ritual, there was nothing that was exclusive to greeks. Drinking, Drugs, Sex...you don't need to be greek to do that in college. The ""characters"" in the book, in my opinion, were boring and had far greater issues than being in a sorority. These women would have acted the same if they were non-greeks. If there are girls out there that would give in to hazing just to belong to a group, I feel sorry for them. I was not hazed once. In fact, our new members were treated very well and never had to complete silly tasks. I also do not believe that Ms Robbins book is accurate because the rituals that she listed of my sorority were not true."
1,Lies,I bought this book to see what the controversy was about. I had an interesting outlook because I read it while I actually was pledging a sorority. I have since found out that most of the secrets she reveals are either misleading or plain wrong. Do not believe these stories as what sorority life is really like. The book does not have much entertainment value either.
1,Not the typical experience,"I joined Greek life my freshman year of college. I didn't get pressured into drinking or being thin. I didn't get forced to party with the ""hottest"" guys. My chapter had a strict alcohol and hazing code, we jsut didn't do it. Alcohol was not allowed in our house and boys were not allowed on the top floor (the floor that had all of the bedrooms) and after midnight not allowed in at all. No I wasn't in a academic chapter but we had to have at least a 2.5 gpa but many had much higher. This book is extremely shallow and doesn't accurately depicts the Greek life experience. Yes, some of these things do happen in some chapters, but most chapters nothing like this happens. Not all women treat each other like this, insecure, desperate, and pathetic girls do this."
2,Didn't live up to expectations,"I debated reading this book for a few months, and felt disappointed after I finally did. Robbins wasn't privy to any of the sorority experience first-hand. Her attempt at Hunter S. Thompson journalism fell short of her goal. Most of her ""tales"" could have happened to any girl at any college in the U.S. The true depth of the sorority experience can only be related by those who have gone through the process. My suggestion is to skip this book."
3,Fun Read,"This was mostly entertaining and I would recommend it to people interested in learning about Greek life. However, it seemed that she went into her research with the idea of that Greeks over drink and are promiscuous and set out to prove that known stereotype. In the book she claims that she went into the research completely unbiased and just wanted to find the truth. Yet, I personally do not believe someone can do this type of research free of bias even if they think they are. People are constantly hearing about the negatives of Greek life in our media so its only inevitable that these thoughts can through in the research as the author heavily focuses on the negative aspects of Sororities just like how they are portrayed in the media. I did enjoy the read but it aggravated me and I think it was completely wrong to reveal ritual secrets (even if they seem dumb to the outsider)."
3,Interesting,"Interesting because of the types of exercises that were advised in this book. Seems a little out of date and unsafe in some of the suggestions yet effective. May need to consult your doctor if you have neck, and or, back problems."
4,Great shampoo/just ok for color,"Great shampoo for hair in general. Leaves hair with shine and body. A little hard on color treated hair even though it is recommended (not terrible, but not the best at color protection.)"
1,Worst Shampoo and Conditioner I have used,"Especially given the price, this is by far the worst hair products I have used. My hair has looked and felt better on much cheaper brands. I usually don't take the time to review products, but wanted to warn others to put their money elsewhere."
5,Good book for young readers!,I read this book as a preteen and remembered it as a teacher. My students love it and it is a straight forward and easy reader.
2,SMALL,"Just a heads up-I was unpleasantly surprised at how small these are! They are the size of 2 postage stamps, or if you fold them for 2 ply they are just the size of 1 postage stamp. I have never seen them this small."
1,What a load of bull!,"This whining tedious screed is predicated upon the thesis that language shouldn't change. I guess Ken Smith thinks that we should all be talking like Beowolfe.I had to stop reading when he said Quality Assurance was incorrect. Wrong! QA is a term used in the technical realm and if not correct, it IS what people use and understand. English is changing, see? We don't say Thee and Thou anymore. We don't talk like the Great Bard and we don't grunt like cavemen anymore either. Get over it!"
4,Excellent Study Guide for Group Discussions on Thomas,"The Gospel of Thomas By Lynn Bauman is a scholarly translation of the gospel that is now known to be the oldest of the written gospels discovered to date. It is not a narrative, as the four canonized Biblical gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, but contains only the words which, according to ""theTwin"" who wrote it, are the direct teachings of Jesus, the Rabbi, to his Disciples. This is the Wisdom He imparted only to his close inner circle. Similar to a koan, these cryptic teachings require great thought and are somewhat paradoxical and perplexing. Dr. Bauman, whose academic credentials are numerous, has translated directly from the original Coptic Greek of the manuscripts which were only discovered in recent years. Dr. Bauman offers this translation as a thought provoking study guide with inciteful questions to ponder in order to come to your own conclusion as to the meanings of these amazing Wisdom Teachings of Jesus."
5,Ramses and Nefret promise to be as intriguing as Peabody.,"I've really enjoyed the focus on the younger characters in the last couple of books, and I'm rooting for Ramses and Nefret to get together. We already know what made Amelia tick. Now it's time for her son to shine a little bit. I wouldn't mind reading a book only about Ramses, who I enjoyed from his first appearance in this series. I think David will probably end up with ""little Amelia,"" daughter of Walter and Evelyn."
1,The characters are one-dimensional and the story is tedious.,"This is my first Elizabeth Peters novel and my last. After seeing the glowing reviews, and considering the richness of the locale, I was so looking forward to being immersed in this story. What a disappointment! The characters are irritating beyond belief--there is nothing beyond a one-dimensional view of any of them, and I couldn't care less what happens to them; and the story is so tedious that it's been painful just forcing myself to finish this book. I can't wait to pick up a real mystery & cleanse the mediocrity of this tale from my memory. I love mysteries, and this held such promise, but was such a bore."
4,What an incredible family,"This is the first book I've read in the ""Amelia"" series. I've read many of the Amazon reviews, and was surprised that so many readers felt this was not an admirable book. Particularly, there were complaints about Nefret. To me, she appeared as a strong, determined woman with a great deal of spunk, and a recent medical degree. Pretty awesome for 1907. If this is not one of the series' readers' favorites, I look forward to total perfection in the past books in the series. In any case, I was pleased with this work and will read more."
1,A very long letdown,"After reading and reading and reading, this book just kind of left off without any real conclusion. For taking up so many pages, I think a story line would have been nice. This book was a waste of good time."
4,Good purchase.,"Cheaper here than at my local Wal-Mart. This is the ""better"" Mobil 1 oil and it really makes a difference. While I don't run it the full ""good for"" (15K miles), I notice that the oil stays cleaner longer and doesnt burn off as quickly in my S2000. I would run redline 10W-30 but this is just so much cheaper."
1,Cheap was more expensive,"Bought this power supply for my research lab. Very cheap as compared to equivalent, established brands. After 6 month, and very little use with moderate load, it short circuited internally. Manufacture warranty had just expired. No reasonable repair possible, just recycle. Beware, sometimes cheap is more expensive."
5,Awesome gloves,No more worries about getting chemicals on my hands. The gloves are durable and I love them. A+++ Seller!!! I am very happy with the product and costs and speed of shipping!
1,junk,"piece of junk buyer beware! would not buy another, does not work well with UV inks , perhaps stains ewww.. but not inks.."
5,misunderstanding after misunderstanding . . .,Yes this books had misunderstandings galore but overall it really was a sweet story. I really liked Marcus and Polly together. Think there should also be a story for Phil. Don't think he should stick it through with that witchy Suzi though!!
4,A good summer read,"I really liked this book. I have been a fan of Penny Jordan for awhile, and this book just proved again why I liked her. At the beginning, I was a little turned off by the main characters, Marcus and Polly. Marcus seemed mean and Polly just seemed too weak, but by the end of the book, I liked them more. It was a fast read, but enjoyable too."
2,I can't believe somebody liked this book!!!!!,"Frankly, I was disappointed. In one word, this book sucked (no wait, that's three words). Still no real knightly stuff, too much boring nautical junk and a lot of boring parts. I can't believe that I was stupid enough to buy it. The only reason I gave it two stars was because the ending was good compared to the rest of the book. If you're a die hard DL fan, buy it but don't read it. If this is your first DL book, throw it out and get some Weis and Hickman. They are GODS!"
5,Bang away,"I am not a jewelry making aficianado, but the project I bought it for turnedout great. It is weighty and nice size for a female hand."
4,Great book for the middle schooler.,This book was great inside and out. The print was big and understandable. The story inside was hard to get the beginning but got Bette as you read on. The price was a steal. Definitely will be buying more products from here again.
4,"Newbery Medal , here she comes!","This book was fantastic! I am so glad I stumbled across it at my school library. I saw the cover and the author, and I thought I'd give it a try. The storyline deals with a teenager who is rescued from an awful summer camp and stays with her two eccentric uncles for the remainder of the summer. Her uncles have these awesome towers in their backyard that are going to be torn down, and the rest of the book deals with their mission to keep the towers standing. The plot is good and I liked the character development. I honestly think that this is Konigsburg at her best and I really believe that this book is a strong contender for a Newbery Medal."
5,"Excellent!! a ""desert island"" quality cd","Somehow this cd flew under my radar for many years. I'm so glad it somehow made it's way to me though. This is a benchmark of melodic rock, and is worth every penny...The songs are varied and well performed and produced. If you enjoy Winger,Hardline,Giant..etc etc...then you'll love this release. ""Empty Promises"" is so cool it's beyond description, reminds me of something off of Operation Mindcrime from Queensryche...(which is a great compliment for sure).Get yourself a copy..."
5,Sweet Memories,"If you're an aging Baby Boomer, as I, and lived in the Chicago area sometime during your childhood, chances are this little book with touch your heart and bring back the fondest of memories. It's a sweet compilation of everything that's reminiscent of a journey to ""downtown"" Chicago during the Christmas season. Whether it be parades, shopping, choosing a new toy for under the tree, or perhaps lunching at the Walnut Room at Marshall Fields, this book hits all the high points. Touching photo's also round out the successful tale of Christmas on State Street. Sit back with a cup of cocoa and savor the memories!"
5,Christmas Memories,"I didn't realize that when I ordered this book, it would touch on so many memories I have held on to for years! Living in Chicago, as a child, my parents would take us kids to see the Annual State Street Christmas Parade. So much magic in the air, with all the excitement of Christmas approaching. It was wonderul not only watching the parade, but to pass by decorated store front windows, such as mentioned in the book, and all the decor lining State State, is a memory that will never be forgotten. This book brought back all those memories, and was quite a trip down memory lane, or should I say State Street.If you've ever lived in Chicago, and was witness to all the Christmas excitement along State Street, you'd so enjoy this book, as I did.Great job to all those involved in getting this memorable book to me."
5,Spot On!,"According to Holy Scripture the entire universe came into existence with the Spoken Word and that's as far is it went. The spoken takes us beyond the creation and tells us creation never stopped with the Big Bang but, to this day we as co-creators are capable of carrying on with the creation process."
5,science of the spoken word,Simply one of the most profound books I have ever discovered. The teachings have significantly changed my life-I am truely blessed and humbled by the transformations which have occurred in me. I highly recommend this book to all on the path of self discovery/realization.
1,Rather unimpressive,Buy the official one - this is a load of old nonsense and a complete waste of cash!
1,Overcome Male Depression: Become A Panty-Waist,"This is overly simplistic, leftist, academic tripe with the following bottom line premise: men are miserable, depressed, violent creatures because our parents raised us up to be ... well, men.Call me cynical, but I'm suspicious of authors who use a Preface to essentially disavow any resposibility or even legitimacy for the treacle they are about to set forth. I guess it is important to know though that the book is based on a lot of their personal experiences and that writing it was a marvelous bonding experience for them.Having established their loophole and ""sensitivity credentials"" the authors proceed to parrot the feminist agenda. It soon occurs to the reader that, from the authors' perspective, the Charlton Heston's and John Wayne's of the world are inherently depressed beyond belief while the Woody Allen's are almost manic.My bottom line: if you're a man this book is a waste of time."
4,"Not GREAT, Not BAD, just borderline in the MIDDLE","I was never a fan of Dragon Ball because when the show aired on TV it was at 5:30am in the morning. I couldnt watch it on the Cartoon Network because they were way to deep in the story for me to catch up. All i knew about DB is that the artwork and character design is addictive. God Bless Funimation for releasing the new remastered widescreen box sets because i finally see the show that everyone loves so much. I decided to rent the GT series from Netflix to see what it was all about when the Z series ended. I started with the 16 lost episodes when Goku becomes a kid again by accident, anyways it barely kept my attention. But i decided to hang in there. You can see from the very 1st episode that the magic is gone. But overall its still a decent anime. There are far more aime titles out there that are just a mess. I'll update my review if i find out its widescreen etc."
4,Plesently short,"Dear future buyers, if you are planning to order Dragonball GT season 1 well heres what your looking forward for. Dragonball GT is the start to a new series of DBZ. While beiong shrunk down to a kid goku is off again for the Dragonballs. This time he searching the galaxy! While it start out how I love Dragonball to be is funny. Not very surprising since akira toriyama is the creator for the first ten episodes. After though it turns away to a side of Dragonball that me and many others have never seen.It is fast pased and action packed. The only problem is it stops right in the middle of the greatest part! Super Saiyan 4! So I would recomend on buying both seasons at the same time. or just the full two season special. It also comes with the story to what appens after Dragonball.Enjoy! :)"
4,=),season 2 is better. the begginning of gt is slow while they look for the dragon ballz its not to exciting till the middle of the season.
5,Can see far away.,I was going to return these binoculars at first but decided to see if they would fit my husbands needs or not. Come to find out they are perfect for him. So now he has a pair for hunting next year and when he hikes.
5,Very helpful and fun to read.,I enjoy this book for it's ease in reading and for the wealth of information that it has given me and my pint size babe. I think that you shouldn't have to struggle to understand a hard-read as you learn how to care for your dogie and that the tricks and hints of taking care of your little one are very helpful.
3,dog book good for beginners,simple to read...good info for those starting life with a new puppy...espically a small breed.
1,my least favorite pop corn,"i really don't like this popcorn. the problem is, i thought the popcorn seemed stale and dried out to me. secondly the butter really doesn't taste like butter. i had no problem with popping the stuff as it all popped fine. this brand just didn't do anything for me."
5,In the simplest words: it is a pleasure and a treasure!,"Coming from a very unorganized person, Susan Branch's book of days really kept me in line. I still use and practically take it everywhere with me. I recieved dozens of compliments- even from guys on how cool it was. It became very inspirational and comforting even when I was having a bad day. I LOVE this book and I guarentee anyone who needs to keep their days organized should definately check it out. Branch is brilliant!"
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,This book is outdated. About all it has of any value is pretty pictures. There are much better books for the beginner out there. I found this out the hard way.
5,Very Heavy,"Heavy, good quality shelf bracket. It comes with 2 different lengths of screws which are fine if you are installing over a stud. If there is no stud behind it, you will have to buy a plastic anchor, or even a toggle anchor or a moly bolt if you're going to put more than a few pounds of stuff on your shelf."
5,The best book I have ever read!,"This series was the best i have ever read, i waas intrueged and couldnt stop reading the books untill i had finished them all, i read day and night, ALMOST OBSESSED! Like i said, best book ever published"
5,Even after all these years,"Even as a parent now, with my own children (now ages 10, 13 and 15) I STILL remember these books from when I was their age. I'm buying the collection now for them (OK, and for me to read again, just for old times' sake).It's been easily over 20 years since I last read these books. I can still remember much of the story and the characters. A must-read for young and old alike."
2,no box for the boxed set,"My husband enjoyed this set as a kid and wanted to get it for our youngest. Since we have a lot of books, it's nice to have a box to keep them looking nice. The picture showed a slipcase box, but we didn't get one. When I wrote to the one who sent it, he said I could return the books for a refund. That doesn't really solve the problem."
4,My first try -- good choice,This is the first Jonathan Kellerman book that I have read. It was very hard to put down. I'm always excited to find a good author--- I will definitely try more of his books
5,Must Read Info,"Live From Death Row is a collection or writings, stories, and first hand accounts that every member of society should read. It depicts the conditions of our prison system in a way we should all come to understand."
5,A classic updated,"I loved Richard Scarry books as a little girl, and my daughter loves them as books & dvd's. Fun mysteries to solve perfect for the 4-6ish age group. Not too annoying like some other children's shows. Huckle, Sally & Lowly star with appearances by other familiar characters. I'm shopping for more as they are the perfect solution to slow restaurant service!"
5,Olympus voice recorder,"This is an excellent recorder to record lectures for school. I purchased three of these as gifts for family members because I have had such a good experience with mine. This little item can help your grades. And, even though it doesn't say so, it works with a MacBook. I love the feature that lets you plug it into the computer and make a CD. The sound is outstanding if you record on stereo. I can't say enough about this product."
5,The best!,"I've heard good and bad about these little recorders. But, after seeing the advertised long record time, I just had to give one a shot. Man, am I glad I did! These recorders are AWESOME! One battery will usually last about 3 hours approx. But just pop in a new one and it's ready to go again. It really will record hours and hours and hours and hours! I've taken it out on investigations and been able to have it record upwards of 20 hours is the highest, best mode, stopping only to load a fresh battery.The little recorder was so good, they are now the new ""gold standard"" for my group. We have now bought several of them...all with the same great results. And they are small and light enough to really take anywhere. I keep one in the car, one in my equipment bag, and one in my purse. And, it doesn't require a lot of power via the USB. So I can plug it into my laptop running off only battery power with no problem! That's true ease of use!"
4,Just What I needed in a recorder,"I was looking for a recorder that could play mp3s and had a feature that allowed me to loop a segment of a track (some say this feature is good for learning a new language as it loops the segment over and over, I use it for music).This player has a ton of nice features and the recording comes out very clear. The only drawback is the volume of the recorder, it's not loud at all. You can max the volume and the speaker still seems lower than other less expensive recorders. Even with the supplied headphones (which is of good quality), not very loud. That's the only thing, it's beautiful in every other aspect. With 2GB plenty of room for your stereo recordings, mp3s and other misc. data. It gets 4 stars only because of the volume output."
2,Too fragile,"I have owned two of these recorders and, while I love the capabilities and convenience, I find that it is the most fragile portable electronic device that I own. The first unit I owned I would carry in my pants or jacket pocket, eventually, most of the buttons became impossible to operate. They just wouldn't work.For my second unit, I splurged on the case for some extra protection. That seemed to help but, lo-and-behold, that unit went belly up after about a year as well.As much as I like the functionality, I guess this device is just not robust enough for the way I use it. I carry it with me everywhere and use it all the time for reminders, shopping lists, phone numbers, music, etc. But, the plastic case simply seems very subject to damage."
3,Good enough,"I bought this activity center for son at Babies R Us (my son was 4 months old at the time of purchase). It wasn't the easiest thing to put together and the musical toy bar was missing. After calling CS, the missing piece arrived a little over two weeks later. My son who is now 5 1/2 months really does get a kick out of it every time we put him in it. However, the Musical toy piece doesn't work quite right. We keep having to adjust the batteries. I think another reviewer complained about the batteries situation in this toy. I would give it only 3 stars... but it does keep my son fully entertained."
2,The design of the walker is not good,"When my son was 6 months old, I brought this for him so that he can play and learn to walk. Then, the walker wheels can't move 360 degree, so my son can't walk in most of direction. As an activity center, this one is not bad. Nothing is perfect for both sides."
3,Walker not so great.,"I read all the reviews before buying 2 of these for my daughters. I was sold because of the stationary & then converts to help with walking. The sit stationary part was great for months. My daughters are now pulling up and attempting to walk so I detached the walker from the base and watched carefully as one of my daughters pushed it around. At first, I thought wow, she is walking - then she stopped and it rolled back onto her. She really began to cry and I picked her up thinking she was crying due to the fall but actually the plastic piece at the front of the walk (where it hooks into the base) scratched her foot and she began to bleed. Needless, to say, I put the walker back on the base and will wait until later to try again. But I am also calling to company to see if this is normal. Thanks!"
3,Okay for entertainment purposes,"My daughter loves this toy don't get me wrong, but it only moves front and back. So if you intend to just use it for entertainment and have room for a real walker then it's great, but if like me you don't have room for both then it's a bad but."
4,Entertaining,This toy keeps my daughter very happy. She would sometimes play for an hour at a time. She loved turning the book pages and beeping the horns. She's now using the walk behind and still loves it at 11 months.
4,Works with Zep's Meter Mist,"I purchased a few (from another source) to see if they were compatible with the Zep Meter Mist dispenser, and they are. Have had no problems and paid 1/2 the price of the Zep product."
5,Hoarding: Buried Alive,This is by far one of the best reality shows available. The mindset of some of the hoarders is absolutely incredible. Kudos to the people who try to help them.
5,Perfect!,"I used this to decorate for a twins first birthday party. The theme was Thing one and Thing two but hey, it's Dr. Seuss on the front lines!!"
4,Nice for birthday party,"Fun vertical banner I used for the door at my 1 year olds birthday party. Not the strongest paper, but good and I hope will last a few more events."
4,Cute!,"The Olsen Twins are hosting a lot of their older songs. Thesongs are not always that great but it's an extremely cute video. Eventhe toughest soldiers will melt, watching this video. END"
3,off the wall stuff,"i first heard of this group way back when, like in 1998. i didnt get their cd till ike 2 months ago cuz i had umm ""aquired"" the music by other means, if you will. but finally i decided to buy it becausae i liked it that much. its a good cd, they rap about some crazy stuff. some of the beats could use a little hlep, but all in all its a good cd. i would reccomend it to people. now, understand that this is mexican rap and it will be different from the stuff you are used to if you only listen to stuff in english."
4,Hard rock that's easy to listen to.,"It's a shame that Harem Scarem hasn't hit big in the U.S. Looking back at the Heavy Metal sounds of the early 90's, they're actually better than most U.S. bands of the era. And Peter Lesperance should be ranked up there with the guitar gods. If you like slow songs from rock bands, then you'll enjoy ""Honestly"" and ""Something to Say."" Not a real kick-@$$ album compared to today's standards, but enjoyable nonetheless."
3,Get original version,I like the original version better. The guy narrating is even more annoying in this second edition. Limited learning options unless you download more.
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY - DON'T BUY,"I was bored of this game just one week after I got it. You have to read the instructions of the game each time you play, there is no way to skip them. I thought I would have lots and lots of different games to play, but on the contrary you only have about 10 games. Each game lasts no more than 30 or 60 seconds, and you only get to play them once each day if you want to save your score (you can keep playing but it won't save your score). Now I get the slogan: MORE TRAINING, IN MINUTES A DAY (literally, you won't get more than 10 minutes of gaming per day)Also, I bought the Brain Age 2 because I am a sudoku fan. Huge Mistake. It has three levels of difficulty, all are pretty easy, also each level has no more than 20 different sudokus to play, so you will finish all sudokus in no time."
3,Gets old fast!,The best part of this game is the suduko. I liked the other games at first but it gets old fast. I played everyday for like 2 weeks and then haven't played it since. It is one of those games I will pick up and play every now and again.
4,"""Fun"" isn't the point","This is a fine update to the previous title. The only major objection I have is that I can't shut the doctor up. It gets really tiresome to have to hear his tidbits of information after every single game. It's easy enough, however, to breeze through his commentary so this is not a major issue."
4,BRAIN AGE 2 HELPS MY BRAIN,I LOVE THIS GAME I ALSO HAVE BRAIN AGE 1 IT HELP MY BRAIN IF THEY COME OUT WITH BRAIN AGE 3 I WILL BUY IT.
4,Excellent game for the whole family!,This game constantly challenges our family to try to beat eachother in each game mode and brain age measurements. It also assists our children in honing their skills in concentration and math skills.
4,BRAIN AGE 2,"FOR WHAT IT IS, IT IS A GOOD PIECE. THE ITEM CAME AS ORDERED, ON TIME AND IN PERFECT CONDITION."
3,BrainAge2 Review,"BrainAge is a fun game to play, but there is more training in BrainAge2!! BrainAge2 is a game that can help you do good in school and can help you get smarter. I believe that BrainAge2 is a good game to get your mind going."
3,"Nice, fun, harmless, witty pop-rock","A funny thing. Last year I lent this cd to a girl who was in the graduating class ahead of mine (I'm currently a high school senior.) I e-mailed her a couple times to try to get it back, but I gave up pretty quickly because this isn't really one of my favorites. Then, this morning, there was a manila envelope in my homeroom with my name on it, containing the cd and not a word of explanation. Strange, huh?"
4,Songs that will stick in your head for days!,"Gordon is a very nice album. My favorite songs on it are ""Brian Wilson"" and ""Be My Yoko Ono."" There are a few weak spots, namely ""I Love You,"" but overall this is a great cd that ranges from catchy and upbeat to nice ballads. Don't miss the little takeoff on Depeche Mode at the beginning of ""Enid!"" Steven Page (who sings most of the songs) has an excellent, distinctive voice. I have such a silly crush this band as a whole because they are amazingly friendly, hilarious, and totally Canadian guys. You'll want to play this a lot!"
1,Missing ABC lacing sweets,"This is the same as my previous item. I ordered before Christmas and have not gotten them yet. I have emailed you regarding this problem, so please respond this time. Thank you, K Correll"
2,Poorly Designed,"I took my time deciding on which bead lacing set to get for my son's 2nd birthday. I chose this one because of the bright colors, capital and lower case letters, and the fact that it stored nicely in it's own jar. I was very disappointed when we opened the package. The plastic coated ends of the laces are too wide to fit through the holes on the beads so the lacing purpose of this set is useless. Also, the end of the scoop is narrower than the beads, so my son has to pick up the bead, put it in the scoop and then turn the scoop over to dump it out. Basically, it doesn't really ""scoop"" the beads. I ended up going out and buying a couple of narrow shoe strings to make this toy work. My son can now lace the beads and still likes to dump out the beads on the floor and use the scoop to put them back in the jar, one at a time."
1,Horrible Dont Buy,"This toy is a great idea but the toy is horrible. The beads REAK of paint it smells like a can of spray paint and I even washed them and let then air our for a week and its still really strong NOWAY do I want my children playing with these with it giving off such bad fumes I contacted the company but after 3 emails I have never heard a respones, they also do not say weather thier toys are made in China aftr email them on that to I'm assuming thier lake of response means yes. Unless you want to get you children high DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT"
2,schlage entry handleset,I was very disappointed with this product. I have bought and used Schlage products for over twenty years and this is the first time I have ever been disappointed with one of their products. The finish did not match the finish on the pictures listed with the item AND the usual Schlage quality was not there mechanically. I would NOT recommend anyone buy this handleset.
3,South Seas Sinners,"Marlene Dietrich stars as Bijou, a South Seas singer who keeps getting deported from different islands because her allure drives men to fight for her attention. As she moves from place to place, she is accompanied by Broderick Crawford and Mischa Auer. On one island, she meets and falls in love with Navy lieutenant John Wayne. He falls for her as well, but her reputation makes her less than desirable company for those around him. In the end, somebody must make a sacrifice. Director Tay Garnett keeps the film moving along with plenty of action, stunning shots of Dietrich, and lots of South Seas atmosphere. The over-the-top brawl at the end is the film's highlight. Wayne, in one of his early major film appearances, does little more than look earnest, while Dietrich is as exotic as usual. It's not a great film, but it is entertaining."
2,Well written but contrived humor,"While a good mini travelogue of Britain, and well-written, the humor seems contrived and thus artificial. While there are some genuine naturally occuring funny moments, Bryson spends a good deal of time trying to be funny and it doesn't work."
1,He complained the whole time,"First let me say I really enjoyed Bryson's book ""A Walk in the Woods"" about walking the Appalachian trail. Second let me say that for someone who livedin England for 20 years he sure doesn't seem to like the country. I read this book because I am going to England this summer. Bryson basically says there are moments of glory interspered with lots and lots of mediocrity and bad architecture. He hardly talks to anyone, and when he does describe someone it is usually uncomplementary. Frankly I was really surprized. I will still read Bryson, but I really can't recommend this one."
3,"Many very funny episodes, with tedious bits in between","Bryson seems to have absorbed much of the best parts of British humour during his stay. At times the writing reminds me of Douglas Adams, and there were many times where I laughed out loud.On the other hand, while his point about the destruction of heritage in favour of concrete and glass needed to be made, it didn't really need to be made on every second page. The judgements that he renders on towns he visits within five minutes of getting off the train wear thin after a while.As well, at times the humour does seem to descend into the mean spirited. As an example which struck close to home for me, I found his description of a joke you could play on ""people from Newfoundland or Yorkshire"" using the London underground map to be a little unecessary."
5,A favourite,"I have read this book a half dozen times or so. It is Bryson (almost) at his best. There is very little in the way of historical fact, or socio-economic observations here, rather, Bill takes an endearing look at the quirks and foibles of the English and the places they live. It is clear, even at his most cutting, that he loves the country and people and he tells his stories in a way that guarantees a belly laugh or two in every chapter.My only quibble is that Bill does go on a bit of a rant about the clearance of the old and construction of the new. It is obvious he loves the ancient buildings and is absolutely horrified by the concrete monstrosities that replace them, but he goes on a wee bit too long on this pet peeve of his. I can identify with him, having been born in Oxford, which he specifically targets, but after several diatribes one wanted to shout... 'Okay, Bill. Make your point and give it a rest.'Other than that, I love this book."
5,The other side of Britain,"If you are thinking of travelling to Great Britain, the UK, England, the Old Country...however you want to put it, make sure you have this book with you.If you want to see the off beat, view what most Americans will miss, find out what makes our cousins over there tick...this is essential reading!(and if you to do all the above and get a good insight to the British humour, be sure to get 'Shakespeare My B*tt!' by John Donoghue )Should be issued in the departure lounge!"
2,Deadly Dull,"This was my first Bill Bryson book. I bought it because the last time my mom stayed over, she was up all night snorting with laughter at A Walk in The Woods. I'm more of an Anglophile, so decided to try this one instead.Gack. This books reads as though the author's brain was in neutral. It is obvious that he is talented, and equally obvious that he is coasting. I got really tired of sifting through endless dreariness and grouchiness; the brilliant quotes and historical anecdotes were great, but not worth the effort required to find them.I ended up leaving this book on an airplane in a fit of pique. Apologies to the poor innocent who found it."
2,If you love drizzle & brick,"I lived in London for 12 months. Bryson calls London the most perfect city in the world. I say it's a huge overpriced crumbling Dickensian slum. If you love brick and drizzle and hate carparks, playgrounds and shopping centres then you'll love this strongy opinionated guide to Britain. Otherwise, forget it, you'll just end up feeing angry.But don't let it put you off Bryson's ""History of almost everything"", which is superb."
2,Boring,"The book initially attracted me as the first couple of chapters were humourous and well-written. But after that, the book got progressively boring, repetitive in style, predictable, lacking in life, soul, and colour. It is difficult to imagine what the author is trying to describe if you've never been to England, so what is the point in reading the book? Compared to other travel writers, I found Bryson boring, boring, boring. I would not pick up another one of his books."
3,mediocre,"I studied this book for A-level English, and found it fairly average. I have read a wide variety of books, and my favourites are those which contain many aspects towards making it an enjoyable novel. This is the only Bill Bryson book I have read, and whilst it was extremely humorous in places, at times it became very repetitive. Almost every destination he travelled to raised the same criticisms, and this was boring for the reader. Overall, Bill Bryson writes some funny and truthful scenarios which the reader can relate to, but at times his humour is in poor taste. The amusement in the novel is all it has on its side."
2,Couldn't finish it,"I was misled by the glowing reviews on this review page. I expected to read a very funny travelogue, but instead ended up plowing half-way through this book before I quit. Where exactly is the humor? It all seemed contrived. There are even a couple of times where the author is amazingly mean-spirited (if I recall correctly, there is part where he talks about a strike at the newspaper where he worked, and how one night when he was trying to leave a guy got out of his car blocking traffic. Bryson says that even after all these years he would still gladly drag this guy on rough ground behind a car. How amusing.). I would have rated this book even lower, except for one thing. My expectations were so high for a really good book and the disappointment so great, that maybe I'm not judging it for what it really is. I suppose anyone interested in Britain might find this book informative, if they don't mind the annoying forced humor."
2,Tedious - I couldn't wait to finish it.,"I found this book so annoying. It was my first 'Bill Bryson experience' and I was expecting to be entertained rather than irritated page after page.Maybe it's because I am English that I did not find him funny, just patronising and schoolboyish.When I had finished reading it I had to get this book out of my house. I am going to read The Lost Continent to find out whether it is actually Mr Bryson that offends or just his condescending manner towards 'my home'."
3,a fun but repetitive book!,"This is the first Bill Bryson book I have read and I found it humorous in some parts. I enjoyed the descriptions of British people at the beginning but as the book went on they became rather tedious as all were similar statements. There are lots of laughs in the book, along with some quite offensive 'jokes'. I found that there is no actual story line, so there is no real incentive to keep reading, as events at each place visited are predictable. This is an enjoyable book to read which succeeds in putting a smile on your face!"
3,"Enjoyed the trip, but I'm glad I wasn't there!","I love armchair travel books and _Notes from a Small Island_ didn't disappoint, altho' I didn't enjoy it nearly as much as Bryson's _The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid_ or _A Short History of Nearly Everything_, two of my favorites. Also, I'm glad I don't travel with the author---his consistently poor choice of accommodations would have had me running off screaming into the night. The man really needs a keeper or a social secretary, even his wife, anyone, someone(!) to make his travel arrangements so he's not stuck in a room where he can't use the shower because of the accumulation of the manager's spit in the corner!! YUCK!"
5,Reading this book in public can attract attention,"This was my first Bryson book, bought due to boredom in normal Scottish summer weather conditions. In fact I did not begin to read it until I was returning to Dubai and ignored the inflight entertainment completely. Bill Bryson's observations are more astute than Paul Theroux's and far more entertaining.I laughed out loud so many times I attracted attention to myself in the BA lounge at Heathrow, and later in Dubai when travelling to Singapore reading ""Neither Here Not There"".At last an American with a British sense of humour."
2,"The good ones were GREAT, but some others weren't!","Of the 18 bars I got, five or six had dead spiders/webs on them INSIDE the wrappers, which were sealed and seemingly intact. Even if this isn't a frequently-ordered product, getting even one in such condition is inexcusable...not to mention gross! Oskri, I hope you see this and correct the problem ASAP. I really liked this product...but I was so grossed out by the bugs, I can't possibly order it again!"
2,A bit heavy on the sesame flavor,"The bars are nutty and nutritious. If you're not really into sesame, you may not be crazy about the flavor...it is a heavy sesame flavor."
3,Not enough early Bronco info,"This is the second repair manual that I purchased that covers the '66 to '77 Bronco, as well as others. The first was the Haynes Pick-ups & Broncos 1973 thru 1979, and I can say without a doubt that the Chiltons manual is far superior. However, it still tends to concentrate on the '78 and later Broncos. I have a '76, and while it gives relatively detailed instructions for the later models, it usually only gives vague instructions for the early trucks, or omits them altogether. It's a handy reference, but not sufficient for more involved work or restoration. Your best bet is still the factory service manual."
3,"Do not drop, breaks easily","This thing is a plastic brew basket. It works OK but is very fragile if dropped (Thats why I had to buy this as a replacement for the original).I dropped my original when trying to dry it. It landed on the floor in the kitchen and the plastic spout at the bottom broke off at the cheap little plastic mounts. They snap off very easy and seem to become more brittle after making a few pots of coffee (due to plastic weakening from heating/cooling/heating)Just be careful and don't drop it! Maybe worthwhile to buy an extra basket just to be safe or keep a French press in the cabinet for backup.On second thought, just use a French press....the coffee tastes, WOW, so much more flavorful from a french press!!! Only problem is keeping coffee in a french press hot for any period of time..."
5,thank you,perfect !!!! just what i orderd... thank you other site AMAZON !!! I had troubles with a another site so im sticking with you guy's !
4,Pretty Good for the Price,"When connected to the laptop, it has a little trouble finding a good signal sometimes but overall it is a good for the price."
5,Awesome movie,This was an awesome movie the special affects look good not fake it was intense and the action was good there was action all through the movie
5,Very very good movie!,"I give this movie 4 1/2 stars. IT has great costumes, excellent fighting choreography. Political intrigue and if all of that is not enough, the women are incredibly pretty.Last but not least, it has a very deep romantic love story flowing through the movie, especially the last quarter of the movie.I would highly recommend this movie."
3,Not exactly as listed,"When something is listed in ""good"" condition, my expectation is that it will be so. This book is physically fairly beaten up and is actually marked ""withdrawn for sale"" on the inside. Won't prevent me from reading it, just something to be aware of from the seller, World of Books."
3,Interesting british lit,"This was a book club selection, It was interesting but not a lot happened, kept waiting for a surprise element that never materialized, no child from a former lover."
5,Want to know the ins and outs of your priests functions?,"If you want to know the ins and outs of what a priest does this is the book for you. I myself am not a priest, but am new to the Episcopalian faith. This book was extremely helpful in what a priest does, but doesn't explain why. A basic step-by-stepper."
2,Tough to assemble/ poor customer service,"I would love to be able to say how much daughter loves riding her new bicycle, but we still cannot get it assembled after several tries and one try by a neighbor. Not only that, but our phone call to Huffy customer service to request a replacement of a small metal shaft that holds the pedal on was a horrible experience. They were very rude and reluctant to be helpful. Hopefully, we will eventually get this part and get going."
2,Smells kind of funky,"My wife is one of those people who we like to bring with us because she attracts all of the mosquitos away. She used this, and it had a bit of a smell to it and didn't really do much for thick mosquitos. Haven't had a chance to use it yet in another setting, but thick mosquitos is where it counts."
1,Doesn't work,I am very sad to say this does not work. I was in desperate hopes of finding something natural for my toddler without having to spray her down. I put one on her right wrist and one on her left ankle. You could do dot-to-dot patterns on her there were so many mosquito bites she received with the bands on.
2,unappealing heroine makes for tough going,"After seeing reviews copmparing this to the likes of Anne Perry and Caleb Carr,I decided to give this a shot. How disappointing. I had trouble warming up to the heroine,Francesca. Ms.Joyce was trying to make Francesca into a enlightened young upper class woman of the turn of the last century-secretly attending college,befriending lower class people,ect. I think another reviewer hit upon the main problem with this story-it couldn't decicide if it was a mystery or a romance. Francesca was supposed to be a bright and articulate person,but when she meets the new police commissioner she becomes just another simpering ninny. I also found her interest in the abduction of the neighboring child to be more of voyuerism than that of true concern. Rick,the new police commissioner was correct in being annoyed with her interst in the case. A most disappointing book."
2,"Good ideas but scattered, sloppy writing.","Mr Martin has good intentions, and reading his words indicates he's sincerely trying to say something in this book.Unfortunately he's also in desperate need of a good editor, not to mention proofreader."
2,Less than impressive.,"I was let down by this collection of stories from one of comics' most celebrated writers. While ""The Killing Joke"" was okay and important in the legend of the Batman, most of the other other stories just seem lackluster and dated. The art is typical of the times the stories were written, not flashy or stylistic, but adequate to tell the story if sometimes a little unclear. This may be of interest to those with fond memories of these stories or those with interest in writing that was ground-breaking for the time, but there's no need to read this if you're looking for modern innovative work."
2,Dated and superficial,"This run-of-the-mill travelogue was shallow when it was first issued, and has become increasingly inaccurate and irrelevant as the country has undergone the great changes of the 1990s.Viewers seeking a more intelligent presentation of the country should consider purchasing the three-tape series on the Hermitage or the three-tape series entitled ""The Face of Russia."" Both are worthwhile, although the Hermitage set is appreciably better."
4,RJ45 Coupler f-f straight,"As soon as I got it through the mail, I hooked it up. it works great as expected. Love it!!"
4,Great Fix!,"I needed a longer Ethernet cable, but had 2 standard 5 ft cables. This little device worked perfectly. I now have a 10 ft cable without the extra cost of buying a new cable. It's a sturdy enough device, and a snug fit. Overall, very nice for the tiny purchase cost!"
5,Good price,Very useful for those of us with many small network cables. I was able to complete a project using the couplers.
1,"Hilary, Hilary, when will you learn, acting just isn't your thing...","I always end up watching these types of movies on TV, years after their release. And usually I watch them for the pure fun of mocking the cheesy cliched plot and bad acting. Hilary, as usual delivered a spectacular performance...as herself. The plot...what was it again? She stopped singing due to a death in the family? Learns to raise her voice...and move on...that that person will always be in her heart?Also kiddies, we learned to lie to people for our own benefit...maybe if Terri had her heart to heart earlier all the sneaking etc. would not have had to happen...just a thought. But no...they have to add conflict. Not that it made the movie better...just more pathetic.If you want to watch a predictable movie, with Hollywood morals and mediocre acting this would be it."
4,Hilary's Best Movie!!!,"This movie shows Hilary's more sad and dramatic side. The DVD is packaged with great extras, the movie is Hilary at her best. She is a delightful actress and singer. Although many say her singing parts in her classes were pre-recorded they are wrong, I saw behind the scenes for this movie, she is really singing, it sounds pre-recorded because of the movie cameras sound catchers, when she hit high notes it sounds different than in reality. Anyways the movie is so sad at parts but at the end it gets too happy like her many other movies. But the movie is definately a must have!!"
3,Better than I expected.,"Giving her limited talents, Ms Duff pulled this off. It was a poorly written, cliche'd story, but somehow it worked. The soundtrack wasn't bad either. One song in particular , which I have yet to identify, was played when she was on her first date with Jay. Good song, would like to find it. Also featured a song from the KEANE cd. Great underrated cd.Musically, Ms Hilary, picked 2 good songs to feature in the film. ""Believe"" was a great song for the Scholarship show, but not win worthy. Glad they didn't take the fantasy too far.Bottom line, if you don't expect much , you won't be disappointed."
1,Is it just me but are all these movies the same!!!,"Hillary Duff is a cute girl in this movie. Is it just me but is the plot always the same in these movies. A girl's mother dies and she wants to live her dream to honor her mother by going to a school for performing arts. She gets teased by her roommate and by pretty much everyone else. She finds a cute boy and they fall in love. The day of the huge residle, Concert, ECT comes and Her father is stuck in a meeting. And she is very sad. (THAT'S VERY SAD, I MEAN REALLY SAD) No it's just pathetic. Hillary, listen if you don't get into some serious rolls your always gonna be typecast as Lizzie Mcguire. You have to do some acting sister. The movie lacks a plot, the acting is god awful. Comeone do some dramatic rolls"
1,Boo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"To me this movie is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.Really it is just about music and her lost brother.There is just no way I would spend my time with this movie.Signed,Chanel Brown 10"
3,well,"it's not the best movie in all the land and seas but it's still a good movie. i'd change a few parts but other than that, well, it's a hilary duff movie. your decision on whether or not she's a good enough actress (not really)."
3,a very good movie,i got this movie for my daughter and i love watching it whith her. We always cry together because it is so sad that her brother died. But that is why i gave it 4 stars because it is a sad movie.
1,"Yuck, Hilary Duff Sucks!","Did I mention Hilary Duff Sucks! Just wanted to tell everyone that I think she is very annoying, has no personality, and stars in simple minded tripe, thanks for making our country's youth stupider Duff! By the way I'm glad your movies are flopping."
3,it might just be me...,"well these cameras are pretty good, but that 656 foot range? forget it. like any other 2.4 ghz camera its gets best reception of 300 feet. ok now here are my problems: i found myself having to move the receiver in all kinds of different places around the room. there is no night vision, however it does well in low light conditions. the sequencer is a nice touch. this would be a great system for you if you are planning to keep the cameras close to the receiver. otherwise dont get this. but if you think about it, $120 for a set like this cant be beat!"
2,Do Not Waste Your Money,"These cameras are pretty to look at but take really lousy pictures. The ""advance"" wheel is hard to use and often doesn't advance the film all the way so you get a double image or no image at all. If you want some decent pictures of an important event, DON'T BUY THESE CAMERAS!"
2,"What can you say, a typical B movie.","I guess there is a reason for this being the first review on Amazon for this movie. It wasn't that good. Don't get me wrong, I get the plot. It is about a group of people fighting for a native tribe that are lied too in-order to force them off their land so a dam can be built. You know small man against big corporation and the small man wins but with sacrifices. The acting is not that impressive. I am glad I bought this in a movie pack so it was not that expensive."
4,non-fiction focus,"This is a great, easy to read book with good suggestions. It is worth the money for the section on how to find an agent alone. You should note that the book is definitely focused on non-fiction books. Page sort of adds comments about fiction work as an afterthought. Still a good buy though."
2,Unknown International Version,"The book came quickly, and is new. However it is the international version which was not included in the original description."
1,Horribly Outdated,"This book was assigned for an undergraduate degree in HRM. This author clearly has not worked in the real world as every point of view is from an archaic way of doing things. He still uses the term ""personnel department""!! What year are we in?? Aside from his ancient rhetoric, it is also one of the most boring books I have ever read and I love compensation!"
1,Frustrating game,"Well we thought this would be a nice game for our kids, not gory violence, lots of fun, etc. My kids played it a few times than asked me to play because they were stuck. I got a little further, but then got to a place that is just too agravating. I would agree that the clips are funny, to a point, and I would completely agree that the controls are far too difficult and it is too easy to get stuck without any help to get out. Stay away from this game. A waste of money."
4,A champagne film.,"The film is a chic dancing exhibition which needs to be released, ASAP, on DVD!! From the first sequence (""Too Bad,"" which features Astaire with three young sirens- including future TV partner Barrie Chase), to the ""All of You"" seduction dance, to the ""Fated To Be Mated"" betrothal duet, it's one class act after another. (Only Astaire's solo ""The Ritz Roll and Rock"" dates a bit, but clench your teeth through it and you're fine.) The highlight for me (should you be wondering, or care) is Charisse's 'coming out' striptease to the title number. Beginning with a pair of stockings, she gets ready for her first date with Astaire (while falling under the spell of Paris), and displays classy sex appeal by whirling through her living room wearing only a camisole, earrings, and flared transparent slip. It has the distinction of being the final major musical film for both of its stars, and is a wonderful swan song to the musical film genre."
3,Death Within,"Worth reading, if you have an interest in what goes on in the head and heart of someone engaged in socially-sanctioned mass murder. Full of details on the mechanics and logistics of Auschwitz, things that only he could know and that usually aren't recounted in the official histories. Counterbalancing this is ... nothing. No emotion, soul, an emptiness and lack of inner life that is in itself one of the most shocking parts of the book. A man with death within."
5,Fascinating & Disturbing,"This book was very disturbing on so many levels. Yet it was also fascinating to see the progression of this semi-average person, into a person who was responsible for the deaths of millions. Read the intro by Primo Levi first to get yourself in the right frame of mind."
4,Good Book,Four stars for the eyewitness account if nothing else. Amazing what one will do and sacrifice for one's own survival. Also amazing what one group can do to another. insane.
4,Riveting and Shocking,"After ""Playing for Time"" it is the most personal and informative account of life in the camp I have ever read. Horrifying, even after all these years and previous accounts. A first person story of a family tragedy that seems to bring to life the psychological, as well as the physical, suffering."
5,Auschwitz,"This book whilst heart wrenching and sad is well worth reading to get some understanding of what it was like to be living in a concentration camp. For the sake of the millions that were exterminated, it is something that everyone should read so that these atrocities are never forgotten."
