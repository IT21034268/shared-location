3,Decent boxers.,I have some of the older Hanes Comfortsoft boxers. I purchased these thinking they would be the same.... Well they aren't. These feel cheap and don't fit as well as the older ones do.
3,Poor Design,"Pros-soft-semi comfortable-cheapCons-legs too wide, inseam too long...like a skirt with fabric joining the front and back in the middle. This means unwanted flashes and an awkward uncomfortable feeling. I'm a little skinny so this probably won't be a problem if you have normal sized thighs-The seam in the back is right along the middle, but I didn't really notice it being a problem"
4,It really works,I was worried that I'd have to get one of my geek friends to help me but I was able to plug it in and it worked on the first try. Pretty good for a not so geeky computer user.
5,USB AB Switch Box,"Excellent results so far. Installed in minutes. It is so light weight you have to hold it down with one hand when pushing the buttons, so I applied 2 sided stick tape to keep it from moving.The price was reasonable.The downside was that shipping cost was the same as the product."
5,Correct Answer to a hard printer issue,"Needed to connect a printer to 2 separate networks, seamless switching with immediate response by both systems for printing. Fantastic purchase."
1,This book was mildly helpful,"After getting my first Border Collie (well, a Border Collie mix) I bought this book in hopes of learning a lot about my new friend. Instead, the first chapter asks if a Border Collie is right for you, and then says Probably Not! It goes on to say that if you are gone more than a few hours a day, you shouldn't have a dog at all! Not very helpful information! Apparently the author thinks that the only people who have dogs are those that are home 24 hours a day!"
1,Extra tracks?!?,"What are the ""extra tracks"" that distinguishes this CD from the original, and that justifies the greater expense?(The original rates 5 stars...one of the best CCM albums ever recorded--most definitely a ""desert-island disc."")"
5,Niles AB-2D,This is a great speaker selector.I own A/V Installation company and it has worked flawlessly for all of my installations. I use a lot of these in the master bedroom to select speakers between the bedroom and bath.Thanks Niles for making such a useful product.
4,boing,Decent shocks for the money. Good middle ground for OEM replacements. I hope they last and hold up to the winter potholes...
2,Promises more than it Delivers,This is a very poorly constructed collection of Gay Men's Shorts.Two of the shorts; Popcorn & Coke and Uninhibited had the feels of interstitials that might have been shown among the trailers at a film festival.The DVD jacket promises a short called My Straight Boyfriend that's NOT actually included in the disk.Also the short listed as Truth or Consequences on the DVD cover is actually Truth or Dare on the disk. Its darkly lit and very grainy.Overall I'm NOT impressed with this collection.
5,Great Entertainment,"3 great Danny Thomas episodes - Includes classic commercials - Dodge and , unfortunately, Camel. The shows are very entertaining and well acted. These episodes precede the 5th Season, and would be a good addition to your Danny Thomas collection, if you already have the 5th season, which is, also, good."
1,Let's get the first season out!!,"I want to see the very first season of the show! I'm talking about when Jean Hagan was Danny's wife and the kid's Sherry Jackson and Rusty Hammer were much younger. In my mind, the earlier years with Sherry Jackson and Rusty Hammer being so very young and Jean Hagan as his wife were much funnier than those with Marjorier Lord and Angela Cartright. Even though season five is already out, there's no trason why they can't go back to season one and progress from there. Releasing season five was a mistake now, however, the problem can be easily corrected."
5,i'm in heaven!,"I love the music! Music with no vocals frees me to make the song anything I want it to be. This CD is hot. My favorite song is ""Encandora"" & the last song on the CD."
5,"Well researched, exciting, romantic view of feudal Japan","Author Robson obviously spent years researching her fact filled, original, exciting novel. The scope of detail far exceeds what one usually expects of romantic fiction. Lady Cat believably rides, walks, and fights her way throughout Japan. The book contains one of the most romantic beach scenes I've ever read: Cat and her opponent duel partially naked under the moonlight. Also there's a scene with a silk scarf . . . breathtaking."
5,I Can See Heaven with These Eyes,"This cassette has a compilation of some of my favorite songs of all time: You Can Say It to Him, I Can See Heaven, Gettin' Ready, Driving Nails, Turn Around, Run to You, What about Him, Have You Made Your Reservation, Already There, and Merciful Lord. Gibbs' voice is distinctly her own and beautiful. Her blindness adds so much meaning to her singing the song ""I Can See Heaven"" with these eyes. BEAUTIFUL! I remember my mom playing this song over and over on our record player when I was little. I still play her songs today. There are very few albums to which I can listen repeatedly without it getting on my nerves; this is one of them. My favorite album of all time!!!Highly recommend IF YOU CAN FIND IT."
5,Thank U Amazon!,"Bought an Ott lite yrs ago to help the eye strain when I sew and craft. Also notice it helps my seasonal blues during the winter months. Love it. These bulbs last forever- years and years. You definitely get your money's worth! I recently moved and the original bulb in my Ott Lite broke in transit. While shopping for a replacement, I discovered most retailers only sell the screw type bulbs now, but thankfully Amazon still has them and I found the best price on one here too. So now I'm back in business. Highly recommend!"
5,"Eliane's best CD so far, by far","This CD hooked me the minute I heard the first note of the first track. Eliane Elias is a tremendous talent, and on this one surrounds herself with great material and great musicians. ""Up and Dawn"" is fabulous, as are both ""The Time Is Now"", and ""Chorango"". The highlight of the CD, for me, seems to be the ""lowlight"" for a few underinformed 'editorial reviewers' I have read. Elias' renditions of Jobim's ""Chega de Saudade"" and ""Brigas Nunca Mais"" feature the virtuoso guitar playing of Oscar Castro-Neves alone with Eliane's bossa-style vocals and 'Jobim-esque' piano solos. Some have refered to these tracks as ""lightweight"". You listen to the brilliance of Castro-Neves' stunning samba/bossa rhythms along with Elias' heartfelt vocal phrasings and tell me who is crazy - me or the reviewers. My one nitpick is that I feel the CD goes one song over where it should end. Still, a 5-star recording."
1,overwhelming disappointment,"i arrived late at the eliane elias fan club, but when I did join the club it was with great enthusiasm. she is a terrific performer and her album ""dreamer"", for example, remains a favorite. but ""the three americas"" is just noise . . . a great deal of noise!! reminds me of a little girl trying to dress-up in her mommies jewelry --- and put on globs of rings and braclets and earrings and . . . there's just too much of a display of ""see what I can do"". the cd was an overwhelming disappointment executed by someone who i think is extremely talented. what was she thinking when she produced this??"
5,Excellent mystery adventure with a fascinating protagonist,"Artie Cohen is much more complex and richly drawn than the ordinary hero of a mystery series. One wants to read more about his adventures, his love-life and his neuroses -- especially his neuroses. The plot moves in unexpected but always believable ways. The descriptions of the locations inspire a desire to hop on a plane and see for one's self. I hope this series goes on as long as Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey/Maturin one."
5,So you wanna be a creative guy?,"As co-owner of a small agency, I shove this book into the sweaty mitts of every new hire. Yes, even before I force-feed them dusty One Shows. Howl-out-loud funny while covering all the bases: client hand-holding, honing a tight strategy, idea generation and why account people are your friends. Above all else, this book allows me to spend less time fragging bad ads from junior creatives. Amen."
4,advertising,Hey Mister Whipple is a good source of fundamental information and skills to learn for anyone looking for employment in advertising
4,Who knew I'd gain respect for Ramsey?,"I've watched Hell's Kitchen and Kitchen Nightmares from the beginning. I'm a bit of a foodie, so I find it very interesting. I always saw Ramsey as a huge egotistical butthead, someone who was so full of himself, someone who screamed, etc. He had a few redeeming moments, but... well, not many. I read this book out of morbid curiosity than anything else, but I walked away with a huge change of heart as far as the author goes. Oh, he has a big ego, he'll admit that. But I think you don't have the level of success that he has had without getting a slightly over-inflated ego. Learning about his childhood and how he rose to where he is today really brings the man more into focus. I wasn't expecting to enjoy this one, but I did. Not just fans of the show will enjoy this, anyone that enjoys memoirs will like it as well."
4,Just life Gordon,This book was defiantly written by Gordon himself. You can tell by the language and how it seems to flow like his type of converstation.
5,A look in the life of Ramsay,"I'll keep this brief, but if you're a fan of Gordon Ramsay anyway, you really should get this book. It's a much closer look into the life of a great chef following his struggles and triumphs through life.I feel those that have only seen Hell's Kitchen are missing a different side to Ramsay. My other favorite show of his, Kitchen Nightmares, shows a much more caring side - still absolutely driven and brutally honest, but very caring. He truly wants to see these owners do well.All I can say is grab the book if you want a closer look into the man, rather than his recipes."
2,What's the point???,"I love ELO, but what is truly the point of this collection? It is incomplete. For instance, where are ""Can't Get It Out of My Head"" and ""I'm Alive?"" And why the heck is ""The Diary of Horace Wimp"" on a VERY BEST of anyone CD??? A crass effort by CBS to cash in on ELO's success! A wasted effort! CBS could have done a wonderful VERY BEST OF COLLECTION with 20 tracks, including the true hits... They failed!!!"
4,Good CD,"This CD has many songs I like but a few, like most CDs/Albums have songs I need to skip. For the most part its a good CD. Takes me back to my school years."
4,BonMot1,Great music with all the best of ELO. It shines with classic hits and musical creativity. It is a sound compilation and a must for any fan.
4,Just right for me,"I am not what you would call a big ELO fan. I have friends, who are, and I agree with why they like them, and I have always liked the hits here, but wouldn't have run out to by my first CD of them after all these years...But then, I was driving my youngest home after her practice with the district honor Orchestra, where she plays various string and Bass instruments and ELO came on the radio and I turned it up and asked her to identify what she heard. She sat and listened and got a big smile on her face and started calling off the strings. ""You can do that with rock music?"" she asked. Evidently yes you can!So I got this set for her to broaden up her view, and mine as well.Great Orchestral Rock."
3,Would have been just as good if half as long....,"OK, so it's a guilty pleasure! I wouldn't even call ELO a ""rock band"" but I do like some of their tunes. All of the hits you remember from '70's radio stations are all there, but there's more that could have been left out (unless you're an ELO groupie). Some of their stuff is just plain cheezy, muzak."
3,All Over the World- but not the very best,"I already owned ""Light Years: the very best of ELO"" when I ordered ""All Over the World"". I bought this CD because it has twenty songs, mostly selected from the double CD ""Light Years"", which has a total of 38 songs. And also it has my favorite ""Don't Bring Me Down"" as the third song. Once the CD began to play I noticed right away that the audio quality is rather inferior to that of ""Light Years"". What a disappointment. I'll be giving this one away."
5,Best of the best!,Best of the best!This is the one for the collection!The followup collection years later is wrong to me. I only recognized one song in that on - 2nd set.LOVE this CD totally though!
3,Be careful about sizing,"If you wear a half size, they blithely tell you just to buy the next whole size up. That's a great idea . . . if you want a pair of shoes that doesn't fit. That's what I did, and ended up with a pair of too-loose shoes that were always uncomfortable. Then I tried the next whole size down. Too tight! Memo to Dr Martens - half sizes exist for a reason!Too bad, I really like these shoes otherwise."
1,Don't use this vendor,"The book took forever to arrive. When I checked the PO Tracker, I found the vendor took book to Post Office THREE days after he emailed that it had been sent. When it arrived, I found he was selling only ONE volume of a two volume set, evern thought this was not stated in his ad. I paid twice what I should have. DDO NOT USE THIS VENDOR!!"
1,"Poor product, poor customer service","I love the look of this faucet so much that I bought two of them. I had bought the first one on Ebay and it leaked immediately. I decided I had just gotten stuck with a reject fauct so I bought another one at the local store. It too leaked almost immediately. I called Price Pfister and found out exactly what to do to get a refund. I did just that. I had my receipt and I even had the box it came in. Price Pfister has told me over and over that I had a $140 check coming. This has been going on for several months and I still don't have a check. I've been in my new house for a little over one year and I've put in three kitchen faucets. I'm sure you won't be surprised that I did not go with Price Pfister for the third one. I paid the same price for a different brand but same style faucet and after several months, it still doesn't leak!"
2,rambling,"After reading McCourt's Angela's Ashes, I looked forward to this book. Didn't like the content or the author. He didn't do anything with the characters, and his wife was a mystery to me. - He expanded in great detail about a crazy man who lived with him for a short time, and only briefly alluded to his divorce. He has been blessed with many talents, why doesn't he use them in his writing?"
2,boring,"I read the book in 1 day. No, not because it was such a gread read that I couldn't put it down. I kept reading it because I was thinking it just has to get better. But that never happened. It's just a dull book."
1,Tis,"As a follow-up to his ""Angela's Ashes"", this book is a total disappointment. McCourt has exposed himself as just another drunken Irish anglophobe. He apparently did not learn anything from his father's behaviour, that he so condemned in his first book. This book is about on par with his brother, Malachy McCourt's, ""A Monk Swimming"", which is no more than an account of stupid, drunken shenanigans."
2,Mediocre at best,"I began reading this book with great enthusiasm, seeing as I thought ""Angela's Ashes"" was such a treasure. ""Tis"" started out in the same style as ""Angela's Ashes"", but lost it's pizzaz half way through the book. What happened to McCourt's stream of consciousness? What happened to his revelations? What happened to his humor? Everything that made his novels interesting and separated them from the everyday novel disappeared. The second half of ""Tis"" read like a high school essay where everything was said in the first two pages, but it had to be a 10-page essay so he filled it with boring, useless drivel. Ireland was so captivating, and America became so boring. What is the point of the last half of the book? So he became a teacher?....I have not given up on McCourt yet. If and when he comes out with another novel I will read it."
3,Good Story/Disappointing Man...,"With great anticipation I began reading ""'Tis"" ... The quality of writing and story were good (except for the too many references to his poor eyes and teeth); but I was disappointed in the man. After his childhood experiences and insight documented in ""Angela's Ashes"", I expected the author to overcome the demons and NOT become an Irish American version of his Irish father...and whatever did become of the poor eyes and teeth? Or is he saving that for his next book?"
3,Average,"This sequel to ""Angela's Ashes"" is sort of disappointing for me. Some of the reviewers were right, this book is in a way, ""whiny"". This book starts off with Frank McCourt life in New York, how he jumped from one job to another and was in a way, lost. He was admitted to the university and he majored in English.This book is disappointing as you feel like he wrote this book for the sake of writing it. It's quite ""draggy"" too and it took me forever to finish reading this book unlike Angela's Ashes (Which took me 2 days). I still read it or rather finish reading it because, in a way, I want to know what happened to the Irish boy who left Limerick, Ireland to return to the U.S. (Where he was born)"
2,disappointing,"The most interesting thing about this book was that I found out that my high school English teacher was McCourt's first wife. Boy, do I feel sorry for her."
1,TERRIBLE,"I PROMISED MYSELF I WOULD NEVER READ 'TIS, A MEMOIR, AND I AM HALF-WAY WITHIN MY PROMISE, BECAUSE, LIKE ANGELA'S ASHES, I WAS ONLY ABLE TO PLOW THROUGH THREE CHAPTERS. WHY I DO THIS TO MYSELF WITH MCCOURT'S BOOKS I DON'T KNOW. I CAN ONLY SAY ""MORE BLARNEY""."
3,"Off to a great start, never reached it's possibilities","I couldn't put this book down during the first half of it. In the end I was left with a great feeling of lessened respect for Mr. McCourt. I expected an author with this much insight into his earlier years to show some personal growth and wisdom as he grew older, but not so. The story revolved around his and his family's alcoholism. Women had no place in his heart, even his poor mother was poorly treated. Females were shown no respect, no honor. The author disappointed me greatly. I give it a ""5"" for a great beginning, a ""1"" for the last half, and an average grade of a ""3""."
5,Brilliant - as a teacher and writer,"The same voice with which he wrote Angela's Ashes, but with the wisdom of years lived. A teacher willing to live the learning experience with his students instead of hammering the knowledge into their heads. Bravo! To all who believe this is just another ""book about Irish Americans"" read again - this is the story of a life lived well - and with Gusto!"
2,They say misery loves company....,"I for one did not enjoy keeping Mr. McCourt company through these pages of misery. They say we Irish aren't happy unless we're complaining. Well writing all this must have made Mr. McCourt very happy with all that complaining. I appreciate how far this man has come however, he should have let us enjoy his journey instead of complaining and blaming all his misery on someone else. The book lacked depth and seemed to gloss over events. The more I read, the less detail there was and the more ""Woah is Me"" I got from between the lines."
3,"Many are disappointed in this book, but ................","they are expecting another Angela's Ashes which is from the memory of a child. He is grown up now and the country is different, he and the people around him are different. No more cute pranks of childhood, but a memoir of a person who still comes a long way in his journey. It is not Disney with the two hour problem and happy ending and the hero finally ""gets it"" and everything is peachy. He does prevail, it's just not the imaginary ""We all lived happily ever after"" ending that everyone would like."
3,I love Frank McCourt,"Frank McCourt's first years in America are described wonderfully in 'Tis. I disagree with many people who found Frank to be whiny and unappreciative. I was impressed with his honesty, especially about his drinking, and I thought it was an interesting comment on how fast an immigrant who grew up in poverty adapts to the American culture of material possession and physical beauty. Of course it cannot compare to Angela's Ashes; if you don't expect it to, it may not disappoint you as bitterly."
2,Don't Waste Your Time,"I was very disappointed with this book. While Angela's Ashes was one of the best books I've ever read, reading 'Tis was a letdown. Frank McCourt comes to this country and has some understandable rough times here, but a lot of the rough times he endures are self-created, and any sympathy I felt towards him in Angela's Ashes was lost in 'Tis. I found myself at times thinking to myself as I read, ""Well, what do you expect to happen when you act like that?"" I wish I never read this book."
4,Realistic and enjoyable,"I believe this was not meant to be a continuation of Angela's Ashes. Ashes was written through the eyes of a boy with his whole life ahead. A life in which things could only get better. 'Tis is told through the often pessimistic eyes of an adult. An adult that realizes that the dreams of youth do not necessarily come true. This is real. Youth is full of good and bad memories, with the good easily standing the test of time. In adulthood we remember our youth with fondness as we persistently dwell on our current problems. 'Tis is about Mr. McCourt's adulthood. However, both of these books share the wonderful writing style of Mr. McCourt. A style that draws the reader into the sore, red eyes of Mr. Frank McCourt..young and old."
2,'Tis,"This book is a disappointment after Angela's Ashes. McCourt's ""all about me"" excursion fails to capture the reader as the life he reports is neither good enough nor evil enough to be of interest. One keeps waiting for McCourt to either enjoy the bohemian life he is drawn to or else reach a turning point in which he accepts the middle class life he toys with. But instead the reader is forced to wade through page after page of Irish Catholic guilt impotent to bring anything more to the author's life than self pity. Hopefully McCourt has not expended all his creative his energy on giving us more than enough information about his own life and will now use his remarkable writing talent to create something worthy of his capability."
5,Another wonderful memoir,"This is another wonderful memoir from the author of ""Angela's Ashes."" McCourt has a compelling writing voice, at turns lyrical and engaging. He has an exceptionally clear vision, and seens the ugliness, the beauty and the humor of existence. His writing reminds me of ""Regina's Record,"" another memoir whose writer has a similiar gift for seeing both the beauty and the ugliness of the world. If you enjoy memoirs, or enjoyed ""Angela's Ashes,"" I highly recommend this book."
4,Review the book not his life!,"You people are making the mistake of reviewing his life rather than the book. Let's not forget this is a memoir and not a fairy tale. So if the story doesn't turn out all happily ever after like you wished Angela's Ashes would turn out, well go have a jump for yourselves! This is reality folks and things don't always turn out the way you want. The vivid writing and engaging narrative voice are still the same. The fact that you're unhappy with the way things turn out should not be a factor when you're judging a book. If you do, then you're no better than Hollywood types that take a melancholy true story and twist it to no end and add a fake happy ending just to make the audiences happy. You sad sad sheep."
2,'Tis rather disappointing...,"As much as Angela's Ashes was a story of survival, this sequel was mostly a collection of snippets from the author's adult life. True, the first half of the book recalled young Frank's struggle as an Irish-American in New York. Perhaps he could have paralelled his achievement of the American dream with his mother Angela's decline, and given us an insight to her thoughts with regard to her sons' success and her own past sacrifices... rather than just fill space until the inevitable ending, when the full circle comes to a close."
3,Could do better!,"The Good Stuff - Frank McCourt is writing about his life. Many readers don't like the person Frank has become, but McCourt cannot change his life to get a better book. McCourt shows refreshing honesty, even writing about the more unsavoury aspects to his character. Tis is very very funny! McCourt is an Irishman, and thus an outsider, so he has his own unique ""take"" on people and events in his life - eg his first day of teaching. The Not so Good - The book is appears rushed at the end, as if McCourt had to fufill a publishing deadline. I'm sorry, but this is unforgivable. I read elsewhere that McCourt has had three wifes, so why is only one mentioned? The author is entitled to miss things out, but it does seem a shame that important aspects of his life do not get a mention. Tis had the potential to be another masterpiece, like Angela's Ashes, but ultimately fell short."
5,A modern-day tale of assimilation.,"Most of us Americans are at least a few generations removed from the difficulties of immigration. Frank McCourt reminds us that we are all essentially immigrants. All of our ancestors have endured similar taunts, jibes, feelings of insecurity and uncertainty in this dynamic culture. But Frank has endured it in recent years, and the way he tells his tale is what makes it so enjoyable. Don't start reading this book if you have things to do!"
1,Bad Service,"After numerous attempts to contactthe seller, Istill have not received the book. Connie spahr 10/13/2008"
5,Angela's story,"If you haven't read the first of Frank McCourt's books ""Angela's Ashes,"" then I suggest you do so. I read that book for my college English class and realized what a talented author he is. So when I found out that he had a sequel, I had to check it out. ""Tis"" starts off where he left off in the first memoir. He tells about his adult life trying to make it in New York city. His biggest goal is to teach, but he must first climb over some obsticles that come his way. He wants to go to college, become a teacher, get married, and have kids like every American.This book has some funny tales of his mischeif while in New York, and I couldn't help but laugh at some of the stories he had from teaching high school. He still has to deal with past demons from his childhood with his mother and father, which makes you both angry and sad. I suggest this book to anyone who has an open mind, and a soft place in their heart for our ancestors overcoming odds in America."
4,Tis a bit choppy,"Angela's Ashes is a hard book to follow and Frank stumbled a bit with 'TIS. He is a fine storyteller and I admire his ability to leap from one tale to another all in the confines of one chapter. But I found little continuity, and had some difficulty making the jumps with Frank. He certainly has the ability to raise my ire with his incipient alcholism and spotty treatment of ""Mam"". All in all, I found the book entertaining, but not among my favorites."
4,"Welcome back, Frank!","Welcome Back, Frankie, LOVE to hear your voice again! Finally read Angela's Ashes after it sat on the shelf a long time. What a mistake! When I finished that, I immediately ordered this. Lovely to be reading what Frank has to say again..."
2,Reader's Choice,"The man who won a Pulitzer for ANGELA'S ASHES does not emerge from 'TIS with his past grandeur. Only when he continues with the story of his family does he touch on literary excellence. One is interested in what happened to his family, what happen to Frank McCourt in America,and possibly finding the key to his genius.Instead he feeds the reader endless character sketches and boring classroom scenes. The repetitious narative (Michael what's left of him) at times became tiresome, but then Frank McCourt astounds the reader with his unique style born of heartfelt love for family. And this, after all, is why the reader will choose 'TIS!"
2,"Somewhere along the line, I stopped caring","I really *wanted* to like this book. The beginning holds some of the same innocent, youthful insights found in Angela's Ashes. Somewhere in the middle, though, McCourt just becomes a whiner and a loser. I only read the second half because I thought that eventually he would recognize his own self-destructive patterns and the book would end with some sense of redemption or triumph over alcoholism and broken relationships. Somewhere between the ages of 17 and 30, Frank McCourt forgot where he put his bootstraps."
2,We know what it 'tisn't,"It's clear what 'Tis isn't - it isn't Angela's Ashes, the Pulitzer Prize winning tale of McCourt growing up in the slums of Limerick. Although this books begins where the last left off with the author arriving in New York, the adult McCourt appears to have very little more to tell and waste the reader's time with tales of his drinking and sexual exploits (or lack thereof) amid endless whining about his career choices."
4,Warts and All!,"Frank McCourt is brutally honest; not only about his family but his own faults as a man. I finished this book admiring him as teacher not willing to be overcome by circumstances, and disliking him as someone who used his past as an excuse to behave in a manner that was totally self-centered when it came to his personal relationships. A complex man is presented, not just a ""Horatio Alger"" character, but a real human being is seen here for all to consider."
4,Great follow-up to the massive bummer that the original was.,"I enjoyed reading this. Angela's Ashes, while a great book, was such a total bummer and McCourt obviously had a better go of things at the time in his life that he chronicles here. I like when things turn out all right and I can totally relate with McCourt's wanting to stay away from Rhode Island's social weirdness."
2,I'm one of the disapointed,"I felt Angela's Ashes really captured the voice of a young boy struggling to comprehend the confusing/difficult world around him. It was charming and insightful.In this book the author still struggles through most of his adult life trying to comprehend things and seems to fail at every turn. It comes off as simply pathetic and clueless.If I hadn't been interested in the characters to begin with, I'd rate this a 1-star book."
3,a good read-- a bit flawed-- but a good read,"This isn't a bad book-- Frank McCourt has had a wonderfully emotional and dramatic life. The problem with this book is the pacing. The anecdotal, spastic pace of Angela's Ashes is what we expect from a childhood memoir. I wanted something a bit more mature and controlled.Mr. McCourt comes to America, does a stint in the army and battles his way through dead-end jobs to become a teacher-- a profession he is remarkably suited for. As always, he is a keen observer of the remarkable and quotidian in our lives.If you liked Angela's Ashes, you will probably enjoy this. After all, it has a happy ending (more or less)."
4,Tis: A Memoir,"I am enjoying this book,Tis: A Memoir, and I hate having to put it down. I have stayed up late sveral nights just to get another chapter in. I am looking forward to reading the next book Teacher Man."
2,The nut didn't fall to far from the tree,I loved Angela's Ashes and couldn't wait to read Tis however I had to force myself to finish this book. I kept thinking that at some point this man would realize that he had everything he needed right in front of him to find happiness. But he never did. He was in many ways very much like his father. He didn't apear to have any passion or inspiration behind becoming a teacher. Every situation seemed to add more confusion to his wo-is-me daily existance including his romance and marriage which was told with a surprising lack of emotion or love. It seemed that the only time he lifted his meloncolly tone was when he spoke of his daughter. I believe that before Frank McCort writes another book he could benefit by reading another best seller by Phil McGraw called Life Strategies. Why did he write this book? There seemed to be no purpose or meaning other than to add another cover to the tavern wall.
3,Hard Not to Compare,"This isn't as good as Angela's Ashes, but it stands on its own fairly well. It is difficult not to remember the author's first work, however, and wish this had that same magic quality."
1,Tedious and whiny,"I just finished this book, and let me tell you, it was a chore reading it. I couldn't put Angela's Ashes down, but it took me weeks to plod through this one. Not only is the story not nearly as gripping, but McCourt seems to have lost the art of storytelling. It takes him pages to tell what could just as easily have been told in a paragraph or two. But what really turned me off was how he held a grudge against his father and even his mother, blaming them for his sorry state, as if his father was responsible for his drinking, his disappointing career, and his failed marriage. It's time to grow up, McCourt."
3,Tis a good book,"A continuance to McCourt's book Angela' Ashes, Tis is also a great book, however I do think that his first book is the best. Within the pages of Tis I found myself expecting his life to get better but at the end of each chapter I felt like maybe the next one will be better or better for him. Angela's Ashes was gold and I was probably expecting the same with Tis, don't get me wrong it is worth reading especially to find out what happens when he arrives in New York, but I guess me like so many others just wanted a big happy ending like winning the lottery and returning to Ireland to save all his family or something."
1,a real bore to read,"After falling in love with Angela's Ashes, I was deeply depressed reading this dreadfully boring book. Everything in this book is a total bore. He has boring stories, he has boring characters, and he keeps wining thoughout the book.His treatment of woman is especially horrendous, and does his mother a great disservice in the way he describes her.Take this book out of the library first. If you love it, buy it, but, most likely you'll be bored with everything that in it."
3,'Tis an Interesting Sequel,"The sequel to Angela's Ashes, the story resumes upon McCourt's return to America. McCourt's masterful narrative style remains intact, but the story seems to ramble at times. It took a lot of guts to shine such a candid light on himself, exposing thoughts, feelings and actions most would not dare reveal."
3,Too many missing pieces.,"Having grown up in an Irish family in NY I loved reading Angela's Ashes. Although my father did not suffer through the poverty, his mother was a widow so he was raised by his Grandmother in Kilrush, he had many friends who did. What I found most disapointing about Tis were the gaps. Frank's picture on the cover does not show red eyes or terrible teeth,it shows a good looking man. Yet when he entered the army that was their first priority. There is nothing about a cure or a dentist. Also, he skips from teaching in Staten Island to Malachy and Michael having a bar and a great time in NY. How did that happen? Tis was a difficult read. It was not a book that I looked forward to coming home to. I had to force myself to continue. Frank McCourt has a wonderful gift but he fell short on Tis."
2,'Tis no Angela's Ashes,"I have to admit that I was quite disappointed with 'Tis. In my opinion, Angela's Ashes contained more emotion than 'Tis. With Angela's Ashes, you ""knew"" who Frank McCourt was but with 'Tis, you only knew what he did with his life. I was anxious to read 'Tis to find out what happened with Frank's life. Although some of Frank's journeys as an adult were adventurous, there were some aspects that just weren't even worth reading. Angela's Ashes seemed to delve more into the heart and soul of Frank McCourt whereas 'Tis seemed to be missing this. 'Tis pales in comparison to Angela's Ashes. As long as you know this before reading 'Tis, you'll be able to get through it."
2,"Great book, poorly printed","Although the drawings and text in this classic shine through, the illustrations make out badly in this reprint. With the exception of the cover, all the colors look drab and ""washed out"" when compared to my very tattered ex-library copy."
5,ONE BONUS TRACK NOT TO BE MISSED!,"When this album was re-released on CD back in '91, it was exciting enough to have this classic digitally remastered(after having to listen to it on vinyl for years).What blew me away, and still does till this day, was the inclusion of MAD THE SWINE, which had been left off of the original release. This has got to be one of the best Queen songs of all time. Why in the world was it not included originally! This song could have easily replaced SON AND DAUGHTER!Anyway, what matters is that we have it now and it is a preview of much of Freddies genius to come in future releases. Overall a landmark rock debut by the world's grandest band!"
5,a must have for Queen fans,This is an incredible debut for an amazing band. They are diverse in both lyric and music. This album has more of a rock feel to it and should please all Queen fans. They did go off the deep end at times with albums like Queen 2. This one is a solid album.
1,ATTENTION: REMASTER DISASTER! LEAVE HISTORIC RECORDINGS ALONE!,"I CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT WENT DOWN w/ THIS REMASTER...""HEY LET'S SCREW UP AND AROUND W/ GUITAR SOLOS AND PUT THEM IN A DIFFERENT SPECTRUM""...""WHY NOT,IT WILL BE COOL,WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY"".SURE,THE EXTRA SONGS ARE NICE,BUT THE REST SOUNDS LIKE SOMEONE(THAT HASN'T A CLUE)PLAYED W/ THE FADERS AND RUINED THE ORIGINAL RECORDINGS.MANY GUITAR TRACKS ARE MISSING i.e.WASHED OUT!I HOPE FOR A FUTURE RE-ISSUE THAT DOESN'T TAINT THIS RELIC!A MESSAGE TO THE REMASTER KIDS W/ A VISION ..LEAVE IT ALONE & STOP CLOWNING WITH GREAT MUSIC AND PRESENT WHAT WAS MEANT TO BE HEARD!THIS IS A MESS! WHERE'S MY VINYL? ANALOG ANYONE?"
4,Queen - self-titled (Hollywood Records),"Review no.58.Originally released in 1973,this was,as most of you probably know Queen's debut effort.Simply just a good album rock catalog release.Loved the playing on this CD reissue.Key tracks happen to be the energetic opener ""Keep Yourself Alive"",the ballad ""Doing Alright"",the rockin' ""Great King Rat"",""Liar"" and ""Seven Seas Of Rhye"".A couple of bonus cuts are tagged on here.Good job,Hollywood Records."
4,"Very real characters and a good ""old fashion"" love story.","Linda Hill's characters have a very real feel as you read the story, you want to get to know them. The book's optomistic view is refreshing without being silly. It is ""old fashion"" because the characters don't just hop into bed - real romance is alive and well."
2,short story,"This is the second of Linda Hill's books that I have read. I found both to be lacking in charter definition. I agree with the reviewer that said this is a good beginning to a story. The concept is good, but she could have made it so much better by adding more detail."
1,Ruined my printer .. Bad ..bad,Please do not buy this ink. My printer head is gone bad and i had to buy new a printer.
2,Somewhat Dissapointing,"I'm a huge fan of the Scene It series and thought that this would be a great addition to my already heaping pile of games. The Disney edition is really limited in its questions, although one would think that with the number Disney movies out there that there would be a huge variety of questions. However, it seems that the majority of the questions have to do with National Treasure and Pinnochio. Also, the questions themselves are poorly done and include things like ""find the Mickey Mouse ears in the still shot"" rather than actual trivia questions. One might argue that this should be expected from a Disney/Children themed game, but even the Harry Potter edition of this game doesn't dumb it down so much.Nevertheless, this game was still fun to play. I would reccomend it for younger kids (under 13) and possibly families."
4,It was fun!,"Played it with my neices...it was fun. The littler one was a little bummed because she was not fast enough to answer the questions so fell behind at first,....but made a great comeback later on. It does have older titles that younger kids MAY not have seen (like Sword in the Stone) but was fun."
2,Mediocre at best,"In terms of special effects and effective moments of creepiness, it works fairly well. The depiction of Kuchisake Onna won't disappoint if you are familiar with the urban legend and have imagined her in your own mind's eye.However, and because we get a pretty good look at her early on in the movie, she ceases to appear so menacing. In my opinion, the mask shouldn't have come off until much later in the film, allowing the audience to build a sense of dread as to what's beneath.The pacing is uneven, sluggish at times, and the ""twist"" ending appears forced. In terms of running time, it could very well have ended 15 minutes earlier and wouldn't have made much of a difference."
4,excellent intro guide for northern gardeners,"This is one of a series of Lois Hole books on gardening. Based in Alberta, Lois sifts through years of experience to provide a very concise guide to the most popular and easily grown plants for northern climates. Excellent photos, tips on planting,cultivating and arranging plants in the garden. This book would be useful to all Canadian gardeners as well as those who live in the northern states. Much easier to use than those encyclopedic volumes which include plants which only grow in southern zones."
2,no substance,"i agree with the previous commentator that this book is shallow and waste of tree (and time). what can we get out of a news anchor, formerly of cnn? not much!to answer the question from craig, there is indeed a dvd attached inside the back cover."
4,Very good yoga workout,"This is a good basic yoga workout. It leaves me feeling very well stretched out and relaxed. It's probably not ideal for a person without previous yoga experience, as she doesn't give a lot of explanation, but I enjoy it. I appreciate the music as a nice alternative to boring new age synth. The girls have lots of tattoos and piercings, but they also are very competent at yoga."
5,Quick and easy introduction to Italian,"This audio intoduction to Italian helped me get the basics prior to a trip to several spots in Italy. For those that know another romance language at any level, it is easy to catch on to some basic vocabulary and verb congugations without even glancing at a phrase book."
2,Sounds like...,"I looked forward to this release with great expectations, only to be completely disappointed. The album sounds like the previous album, but has none of the inspired lyrics or hooks. It follows the exact same formula of the previous record with the sounds, the order of the songs, even the compositions. But the songs all feel like imitations of the other record. It's like a poor cover version of themselves. Let's see if they can recover from this ""Sophomore Slump."""
3,Looking for descriptives,"The Editor's ""An End Has a Start"" is one of those albums that sounds really grand, with an epic scope and a certain depressing grandeur. But it has little by way of memorable songs. After several weeks of listening, there's little that stays in my mind or draws me back for further listening.There are a few songs that make for cool stylistic comparisons. ""Smokers Outside The Hospital Doors"" recallsInterpoland there are a few hints ofSimple MindsorU2, especially in the Edge-like guitar of leader Tom Smith. It's moody and competent, but not particularly memorable. Fans of Interpol, Bloc Party and otherJoy Divisionacolytes might enjoy, but The Editors don't sound like they're fully connected on ""An End Has a Start."""
4,I was so uplifted by the simple beauty - natural beauty,"I found a copy of ""Always Colorado"" in my father's cabin. I fell in love, instantly. It was so refreshing, so simple, so natural. Not manufactured. Just breathtaking beauty. I have never been to Colorado but I feel that I could describe the landscape as if I had lived there all my life. I have seen several books on Colorado but ""Always Colorado"" was so innocent and pure. I felt cheated when I turned the last page. I left knowing that Colorado is the place I want to take my husband and children on our next vacation. The world needs to get back to the basics and teach our children about the real beauty in life, the things we usually take for granted; pure, honest, nature.Thank you, Jon, I look at this book a lot and I see my daddy on every page."
4,Wonderful for creative imaginations!,I bought this cd expecting to be greatly disappointed. The first time I listened it didn't take over my senses quite like Eden did. But then I realized I had been comparing it to Eden too much and now the more I listen to it the more I love it. I love her sense of style and creativity that she used in this cd. It's not like any Sarah Brightman you have heard before.
2,A Tremendous Singer with A Disappointing Song Selection,"Although I am a very big fan of Sara Brightman, I have to say that this album is very disappointing. I am glad to see that she is starting to sing songs from people other than ALW but,I would like to see her with some better songs to sing. Dive is a terrible album."
2,"Captain Nemo should have said ""No way"".","While Sarah's voice soars as usual and the musical accompaniment is often very strong, this record's inane grade school lyrics send it to the bottom of the sea. Save your money and buy ""Eden"" or The Webber Collection instead."
2,Not the Sarah Brightman I know and love,"I bought this CD because I love Sarah Brightman, and because it got good reviews, but I was very disappointed. I chalk it up to taste, because obviously a lot of people like this CD. All I can say it if you are expecting the Sarah Brightman of classical cross-over, you will be disappointed. This is her attempt at pop, and I am just not appreciative of it. Give me ""Classics"", ""Time to Say Goodbye"" and ""Eden"" and leave this one in the store. I'm not giving it one star out of respect for Sarah Brightman, and because I can't believe I would buy a one-star CD. :-)"
3,Pretty Good for Sarah...,"this is a pretty good cd, it's very popish sounding.best songs:captain nemosecond elementworst songs:salty dog (very odd indeed)diveso,as i said before, this is a pretty good cd - but only if you're an avid sarah fan. otherwise, pass this one by and spend your money on either 'it's time to say goodbye', which desplays sarahs operetic voice with the most beautiful opera song on earth or the special import cd sold here on amazon called 'eden & time to say goodbye- all in one!!"
4,Compilation Clarity par excellence,"Payne has succeeded in producing a volume of clarity, precision and quality. Highly recemmended for any student of the Bible."
5,Much respect for 'Respect',"I just received this album in the mail yesterday; the last time I'd heard it, was 5 and a half years ago on tape...the tape got mangled by the machine and that was that. Robyn Hitchcock has never sung a note in his life...and yet, if he'd never started making records, we'd all be the poorer for it. My fave track is probably 'Railway Shoes'; I love singing harmony with that song. Second fave would be 'Driving Aloud (Radio Storm)'."
3,I Expected More,"While an enjoyable read, I found this book to be not as focused on the home schooling aspects of the Farris household as it was on their family concerns. For example, a significant part of the book deals with their decision not to use artificial birth control (50 pages) and giving priority to God and your husband (another 50 pages). If you are home schooling (or thinking about it) for reasons other than a biblical directive you perceive, this book may not offer you as much as you'd hoped."
5,Gotta love it,"I have Zed issues 1 through 4 but I had to have them all again in one entire book cause Zed is just that good. Funny, endearing and has heart. If you have all of them or even if you dont you should get a copy of volume one, your love it. Now I just cant wait for volume two."
5,Wonderful!,"In the words of one newspaper reviewer, it's difficult to write about this, so I'll say something I've never said before and will probably never say again: This is the best show I've ever seen."
4,Leonard Cohen Live in London,"Never knew who he was,never heard of him but i like his music . He is a jazzy folk kind of singer."
5,Leonard Cohen has it all,"Leonard Cohen and his band are talented, relevant, and their sound stays with you and makes you want to keep viewing his DVD. He has a unique style and an excellent band and singers."
5,Great!,"Leonard Cohen is at his best in this concert. The concert is great, and the quality of the recording really shows it off."
2,Disappointed,"The play list is great. The video is very good, considering that it is a largely static subject (a band on a stage). The problem is the audio: there's a constant echo. The audio engineer apparently didn't account for the amplification needed for a folk singer in a huge hall. The echo is persistent, annoying, and makes the lyrics (the main point of the performance) largely unintelligible.I wouldn't give this DVD to anyone; I'm going to trash it."
5,great country music,It is a real shame these songs never got the air time they deserve.....I recently met and saw Ray Scott at the cma fest.He has a solid band and he is a true country performer enjoyed his performance and this album very much
5,"Wit, talent and catchy tunes!","Listening to this CD will leave you wondering why we're not hearing a LOT more from Ray Scott. Not only does this singer have one of those great country voices, he writes the kind of lyrics that can only be inspired by someone who's really lived them. His music combines wit, talent and catchy tunes. I could listen to this over and over again. Here's hoping for more like it!"
1,DANGEROUS--STAY AWAY,"I was a user of System Mechanic 5, which was a decent product, so I upgraded to 6. This version tries to make it easier to use by removing most of the decisions a user has to make. The only problem is it makes BAD decisions. At this point I would not be surprized if I had to take down my entire system to get it working properly again. Frankly I do not understand the positive reviews of this product. My advice is to STAY AWAY. But if you decide to use it, before you do back everything up with a Ghost type product so you can completely undo the changes. Despite what Iolo promises, they cannot undo all of the changes their software makes. Also, don't use the Wizards, which sound great but will do all kinds of bad things if left to make their own decisions."
1,The Worst Customer Service I have ever experienced,"I bought the SW through ZoneLabs and for some reason the user and license key I got are useless to install the already-paid updates of this SW, even after following suggested fixes. I have sent 4 emails to customer service (no tel. is ever provided anywhere) and I have always received the same (useless for my case) canned reply with (useless) suggestions to fix the problem. The SW seemed to work fine when it worked but at this moment I have had to uninstall the product. I would not consider renewing or buying again from this company. The customer service is just AWFUL"
5,I give this to people who are going to get a new dog,"This book is so useful - I wish someone had given it to me before I adopted my dog. It just makes you consider things that you don't think about when you're staring into the big brown eyes of that cute ball of fur... The heart gets all distracted and forgets about the *practical* things. It not only gives training tips, but the most valuable part is it gives great guidance on things to consider when getting a dog. Determining what size/breeds are best for your lifestyle, how to test dogs up for adoption for food aggression, sensitivities to sound, etc... I highly recommend this book for anyone who's going to get a dog.Adopt the Perfect Dog"
3,very thin,"This was a good cheap deal for a Columbia jacket, however the jacket itself is very thin material and pretty much only good if you're looking for something waterproof either in the summer or with some warm humid rains."
2,Too Much Downward Facing Dog,"I'm sorry, but it seems as if Kristin is stuck on one continuous Downward Facing Dog on this DVD. It seems like there could've been alot more ""moves"" to mix things up in this workout-I felt like I was staring at the floor most of the time, and it's really hard on your wrists! I guess I'm used to a little more variety in yoga workouts..."
2,The Gettysburg Campaign,"Ordered The Gettysburg Campaign: A Study in Command as a Christmas gift for my grandson. Even though I ordered a ""new"" book, it came with a large black slash across the top pages of the book. Very disappointed as it looked like a used book."
4,Great Jazz CD,"Really interesting line up of guests, this is the best recording of Keith Jarrett's standard, ""Lucky Southern,"" maybe because it's the only one with Jarrett actually playing on (his best known composition, doesn't appear on any of his CDs or records)."
5,Good for young girls!,"One of the best fantasy novels for young girls - strong female protagonist, no swooning and deferring to the 'hero' to get her problems fixed. No romanticizing of vampires as beautiful ideal heroes with no problems, I loved it as a young girl, and still do. Best Ending Ever."
5,A masterpiece!,"This was probably my favorite book ever! It was an exciting view of Vampires. I had always thought of them as evil, but this book really made me think! I couldn't put it down."
1,Didn't work for me,"This product did nothing to lower my blood sugar readings. However, it must work for some people as it is recommended by Dr. Richard Bernstein, the chief proponent of extreme low-carb diets. Dr. Bernstein. who likes his patients to maintain A1-C numbers in the normal range (not just in the ""normal-for-diabetics"" range), writes that he adds it to diets of patients who are not quite hitting the target with traditional medications. Perhaps I will give it a try at a later date, but for now I am getting better results with other products,"
4,Beyond Captain Beyond,"Monster Magnet returns from their drug-induced haze to powerslam your withered soul some more... Stripped down to the bare hard-rock essentials, Superjudge sheds some of Monster Magnet's earlier psychedelic experimentation (along with a guitar player) and adds ear-splitting leads and balls-out megasludge that'll sound perfect blasting out of your '72 Plymouth Duster. If their older stuff was Blue Cheer, then this stuff can only be described as Deep Purple... Smoke!"
4,Thoughtful volume,"This collection is very satisfying. There are useful and short essays on zen poetry, and the poetry is kernel sized but with outsized messages. And, like all good poetry, lets you gap fill and extrapolate. Pick up a copy of ""Japanese Death Poems"" to compliment this collection."
3,Dancing with the truth,"I try to see all super series. I liked this one. It started with good locations, an interesting premise and a few anti heroes. The two women are lookers and well played, the men are also equally interesting characters and well played. the story lines - B movie types - meaning low budget scripts. Some better then others. Some editing should of been done over - but all and all. Fun to watch. The end of the series suffered from poor locations and clearly a lackluster budget. But it started well and ended on it's own term's. Unlike The Others which started strong and killed all the characters in a single show."
1,"The show is great, but anchor bay sucks!!!!","how the hell it is possible that this great show does not have a choice of subtitles or languages? Anchor bay and Paramount are the only ones that does not add to their shows these options, I remind you gentlemen, that in the United States, the second most spoken language is Spanish, followed by French, Thai, Korean, Portuguese and so on. So, what is your excuse?. In an increasingly globalized world Anchor Bay and Paramount both shows an incredible xenophobia, and definitely disturbing. I love this show, and I speak and understand English, however i will not buy it, and I recommend anyone who does not have English as their mother tongue do not buy it. Enough to discrimination against non-English speakers."
4,"Old' Skool"" kung fu!!","I usually agree with that ""Morgoth Dude"", however with this one I must dis-agree. I too have approximately 240 of these old school kung fu movies, and I feel this particular one ""5 Element fung Fu"",,is not entirely that bad. Infact it's pretty decent. Lots and lots of old school kung fu fights. The story is pretty good and equally inportant, the DVD transfer acceptable. Not a bad put out from the Wu Tang Crew. I purchased this movie for approximatly $3.96 (Canadian)at Walmart here in Toronto,,and I would have paid $10.00,,it would have been worth it!!"
4,4,I like the 5 Element of Kung Fu But it was'n what I was looking for I was looking for the china super ninja and I got it and I looking forward to buying more movies from you THANK-YOU very much
4,Fills a void,"I ordered my Johnson Century to fill a void left when I gave my daughter an existing Johnson Century. My daughter is in her 30's, but used that reel when she was in her teens. The new reel is as reliable as the older original one. So far so good! I have had approximately 4 of the reels over the past 20 plus years. Always reliable for fresh water fishing!!"
1,Returned Book,"I actually returned this book. I have emailed Striking Images three (3) times with absolutely no response. I have proof from the post office that it was delivered on May 22, 2009. I expect a refund, but like I said, they will not respond to my email."
1,UnChristian Wickedness,"I don't know which is more amazing, that someone would write such a shamefully cruel book in the first place, or that they would insult Christianity by suggesting that the Christian god would approve of it. It is hard to imagine anything further from the teachings of Jesus than this sadistic viciousness. It goes without saying that what they recommend also contradicts everything modern science tells us about how to raise happy, healthy children. Shame on Amazon for selling it. I find it hard to believe that Amazon would stock a book recommending that husbands beat their wives in this cruel fashion. I hope that anyone who even thinks of following the advice offered in this book sits down and has a very good read of the gospels first. Jesus Christ is a much better guide to follow than the Ezzos."
4,"Extremely helpful and practical, but must use common sense","Very helpful, practical and assisted in bringing like-mindedness to our church when it was full of parents of children ages 2-12. With that said, although I'd still recommend it, you need to go in with a thinking brain, use common sense, and beware of a tendency to be legalistic as well as judgmental when you are around others who have not been taught this way (or disagree with this method of child training). Really, this is biblically based, and a wonderful child training method. Our advice is to balance it with the heart training methods taught in Shepherding a Childs Heart by Tedd Trip."
1,So what happens if the husband gets home BEFORE the wife?,"Am I sinning because I work and God forbid work later than my husband? I think I will pass on this program, it comes across as a selfish parenting technique. My kids are well behaved but they are kids, not puppets. They are important, they are valued, their ideas and thoughts are significant. I expect politeness but children have to be reminded repeatedly about their good manners. Hmmm, sounds like something God does for us!! We are to parent just like He parents us. God has never snubbed me, I think I'll stick to the bible for my bible based life."
3,"Use what you need, toss the rest.","Most people writing a review either LOVE the book or HATE it. Here is my honest opinion. There are some really GREAT concepts in the Ezzo's view of child rearing. There are also some fanatical views that I totally disregarded.That said, the good parts about discipline are VERY worth learning.Take everything with grace and a grain of salt.Use what you need, toss the rest."
1,my whole church was a supporter in GKGW,"And I backed out 17 yrs ago BC the classes was telling me not to feed my newborn anymore than a certain amount, my child was on cereal before 6wks. My son is 12yr 6ft now and he's skinny! He has always ate a lot! IM GLAD I DROPPED THAT STUPID TEACHING! I heard of the class when I had my daughter, first child, and the church was teaching GKGW was the way....well most of my church children didn't grow up and become godly people. Most did drugs or stopped believing period. Do yourself a favor and go to Love &Logic. Now that was helpful. My 17yr old and 12 yr old is proof "" love & logic"" works."
1,promoting child abuse,"Anyone that buys this should not be a parent. Physical punishment is child abuse. Just because this book has a set of rules regarding the abuse they encourage does not mean it is well-intentioned or a reasonable means of punishment. Imagine reading a book on how to physically punish your wife and have that be taken seriously...same thing, the bible has info on spousal abuse as well. These people are misguided and obviously trying to make money off of their religion. DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!"
5,Very pleased with Honeywell HCM-300T,"Purchased this from AMAZON and I have to say after two days of initial use I'm very pleased. My only neutral comment is that it is undersized for my need, but that's on me. I'm using this in a 460sf living room (1600sf home), and humidity rose from 30% to approx. 38% in 12hrs. and this in on highest setting. We live in the DRY Tucson area where winter humidity usually is below 10%...so, I'll be looking at getting another humidifier to help out.Not sure what other reviewers have said on leakage, I've seen nothing along these lines. I think the main point here is paying attention to detail. You have to be very careful with placing the water tank into the system, so that you don't push the wick/filter material into the tank path."
3,"Fine, but Not Great.","I purchased this humidifier for my new daughter's room. I liked that it was germ-free and cool mist. It is advertised as quiet... it's not. I have owned it now for three months and the fan seems to be getting worse. This may be the durability issue that others have described starting to appear. I do not run out of water. There are four settings that sense the humidity in the room and I keep it between the ** and the *** (out of ****). I'm happy with it. I get the sense that the vapors are clean. I do wash it every two weeks, but I have a baby; it may not need it that often. It is cheaper than other germ-free humidifiers so it is a somewhat more frugal way to go. Just make sure you maintain it. It's fine, but not great."
1,Expensive disposable unit,Filter elements are expensive and only last 2 to 3 weeks. The fan stopped working when less than a year old. The unit cycled off/on repeatedly when moderately cold (35 deg F). It's a poor design with an underpowered blower. Do not buy; it's junk.
1,MOLD!!! MOLD!!! MOLD!!!,"This is a stupid, idiotic design shared by the whole line of these products. The fan sucks humid air through the fan turbine and the parts of the machine that are not accessible for cleaning. In a couple of months of use mold grows all over the inside, including the fan turbine blades. De-molding it is nearly impossible. So, great, now instead of breathing dry clean air you breathe moist air with mold spores.All the fancy stuff they add to fight germs (UV light, ProTec cartriges) are a joke -- it does not help a bit.I just cant figure out why the designers did not reverse the air flow, so that humid air goes through fewer parts so that when mold grows you can clean in easily."
3,Can be noisy when on full blast,I purchased this unit for my family room. It does the job but the fan is pretty loud when it's on full and and the mist emits from the lower vent. I can feel the cold moist at my feet and that makes having this on uncomfortable.
3,Honeywell HCM 300T humidifier,"We purchased this Model in 2007. I have not experienced all the same issues or to the degree that others have had, no leaks & I expect to fill it every other day or so in the winter months. The biggest problem I have had after about the 2nd season of use, is the noisy fan issue. The fan has never stopped working all together.Once a year, I spend about an hour to disassemble the unit and use a bit of WD-40 to lube the fan motor & shaft. I have to say, though, that they do not make it easy to get to the spot where the little WD40 straw will get to where you need it to be. you will have to deal with the WD40 smell for a day or so, so I leave it running in my garage for a few hours to disapate the smell.It's fairly reliable but I would not likely recommend this unit to someone else. I regularly use the water treatment chemicals and have not had any discoloring or algea issues. We have well water so there is a hard water issue and it seems to have held up OK depspite this."
4,A Pleasure Explosion,"Wow. How to describe this album. It shimmers, it saddens, it smiles, it exhilarates, and it has this certain... groove... to it that I simply cannot put into words. By the middle of the album may likely wonder, like myself, how one would begin to describe the mood of it. Arials explores a brainspace not commonly visited by other artists. It walks the listener slack-jawed through a beautiful, glimmering corridor; one which leads to an immense, majestic, comforting, and yet somehow lonely place. The cover art is brilliant and fitting; black everywhere, but oh how those flowers gleam. Ariels is a storybook for realists. For those interested in electronica with a dose of organic instrumentation (think BT or Delerium) this album is a must."
2,Broke apart within 5-6 uses.,I've had many of these types of carts over the years. They are by their nature cheap. I go through one about every 6 months or so. This one however only lasted about 2 weeks. Well below the average for these things. Choose another brand.
2,Not very stable,"It's okay, but I'm fearful of loading more than 20lbs in it. It tips easily while toting only 10-15lbs. The retractable handle is REALLY rickety, it feels like it may snap off at any time. Wish I paid more for a better, more sturdy model."
1,Quality Control,"When received, the cart was missing a pivot dowell from one side, the others look like they will fall out also. The Lid/seat will not attach to the front as shown in the photos, It appears that the plastic used in construction is not flexible enough for the tabs to grasp the edges as designed. I drilled through the Lid and the front at the four dimples, inserted small bolts in the lid and put nuts on them to stay with the lid, when it is attached to the front of the Quik Cart it is held by wingnuts inside. It makes for easy removal and the wingnuts are then kept on the bolts. Other than this, I would rate it a Five."
2,CHEAP,"Yeah, I got this for nursing school, and it ended up covered in duct tap after 2 weeks. 2 WEEKS! This is a poor buy.. If you want durable, go to Lowes or Home Depot. Get a toolbox on wheels if you want something that'll last!"
5,Happy Seniors,"I purchased these carts for my 78 year young mother. She loves to walk and shop, how much better can this be, She can walk and shop and never have to carry anything."
1,Broke quickly,"I bought this to transport papers from my car into buildings (not a lot of them, less than two reams of papers at any given time). It broke the third day I took it into a building. I bought one for $10 less from Staples becasue I didn't have time to return this and wait for a new one. The cheaper one is going strong and I have loaded that one heavily."
1,Bad product,It was not a good product. The lid was broken when I received this item. Dont buy this item from this company.
3,made life easy for 6 months,"I am a caregiver and I haul groceries, laundry, water bottles, etc to and from my car. This cart saved me a lot of trips but then today the handle snapped in the middle and I can't figure out if there is anyway I can put it back together. I have grown to depend on this cart so I will probably end up getting a stronger one. Going shopping this weekend to see what my options are."
1,Complete Garbage...,"This is a waste of money. The range it requires for two cybikos to communicate is horrible, and so little people actually have them, so the whole wireless feature doesn't work. My brother has a cybiko, and so does this kid down the street from us. they don't work at that distance. Whenever they are at a close enough distance to use the cybikos to communicate, they might as well yell back and forth to one another. The games, I don't like 'em, plus you're limited to what they let you download. And everything else, not reffering to comunication and gaming, is horrible as well. I say pay a little bit more, and get a PDA, maybe go for a cheap Palm. And a cybiko is NOT a plam pilot, despite what they have stated in advertisements. So in th end, just getting a PDA would be better in the long run."
1,sucks,THIS toy gets me so mad you charge is for 15 houres and 2 min's after you take it off the charger the battery died. I threw mine out the windows. I hate cybikos never buy one. I dont care if its free do not get one
2,This is outdated by a mile,"This thing is no good.It has low battery life which makes it almost impossible to use it off of the charger.I got it and I was all excited.Well, I was pretty disappointed when I got it.The games are in black and white and they are pointless.If you want to communicate to someone they have to be in range which is 300 ft. like that is going to happen now.To get on the internet you have to download a program to run it, but you have to be in range with a computer hosting the server which is impossible.I advise not to buy this product."
3,Ok,"I personally love the cybiko but I encountered a technical diffuculty (the screen froze and then the battery would no longer charge) and because the company shut down I could not ask for technical support. So it was fun while it lasted , but if you can't find a repair place for cybikos I really advise you take EXCELLENT care of it."
4,Bargain price for a slightly outdated gadget,"I got a couple of these as gifts and tested them right out of the box. As others have mentioned none of them would work without the charger plugged in. However removing the batteries and cleaning the terminals usually worked. I was able to massage two of the three cybikos to life this way, with battery life averaging 4-5 hours. With the third cybiko the batteries were so severely corroded that cleaning had no effect whatsoever.The Cybiko itself is slightly outdated but for the low price of $10 you can't go wrong. Cybiko's website is still running and there are a ton of games to download for those who willing to find them. Its also very durable and can stand up to quite a bit of bashing. However, there is no doubt it is a ""toy"" and will never replace a palm in terms of funcitonality. For the geek-minded you can download a full-fledged SDK to write your own progs, but don't expect to find a burgeoning community of developers."
1,Toxic waste,I ordered 2 of these and both would not take a charge. I looked at the batteries and they had leaked. This had ruined the units because of the corrosion. I returned the units for a refund.
5,Good mix of songs,"Matthew and Gunnar's ""Life"" CD showed a good mix of songs and their typical great harmonies. The song, Life, written by their father, Rick Nelson, features some soul searching questions. A girl Like That is one of my favorites."
4,great read,A great read taking in the context of someone that toured the missions in the early 20th century. Well researched. Don't skip the last chapter that states the train fares to get to all the missions.
5,Good Selection of Tunes by a Genius,"I am writing this review solely for the purpose of refuting the previous reviewers remarks about Kenny Dorham and his music. Kenny Dorham and the work he did on Blue Note in particular represent the most original and beautiful jazz writing... ever. The fact that he isn't singing on any of the tracks (he did a couple of albums featuring his voice) should not dissuade anyone from buying this disc; along with being a great writer, he has a very interesting and appealing approach to the trumpet, and played with some of the greats of the Bop and Hard-Bop eras -- including Charlie Parker and Sonny Rollins.On this disc there is a good sampling of the ground breaking work he did with Joe Henderson in the early 60's, as well as cuts from Whistle Stop and Afro-Cuban. I recommend this disc highly for anyone interested in exposing themselves to a very cerebral writer/trumpet player."
4,Great for Quite Time; OK for Quotes by Christians,".I enjoy this book for two reasons:(1) It has a short verse (or a few short verses) of the Bible for each day of the year and a quote by a well-known (or not so well-known) Christian regarding that (those) verse(s). Some of the well-know Christians quoted are Martin Luther, C.H. Spurgeon, J. Hudson Taylor, Pascal, and D.L. Moody himself (he uses the word ""selected"" to signify his own quotes).(2) The book has an index of Scriptures quoted in the book, so it may use it to find quotes to use when teaching on a specific verse of the Bible.What this book lacks: The full names are not given for some of the Christians quoted. Mr. Moody assumes his readers know who they are. Also, there is no index of Christians quoted, so you may not easily search for the quotes by author.One of my favorite quotes of the book is this quote by Moody: ""The preaching that this world needs most is the sermons in shoes that are walking with Jesus Christ."""
3,Mediocore..,"Grant is just annoying in this film, Moore is wonderful, Tom is hilarious, but Wilams is hysterical. Buying this movie for his cameo alone is the only way I'd recommend it. You can skip through the rest of this slightly funny, but mainly annoying comedy.Its a good idea...but it just doesn't work."
1,WHAT A TURKEY!,"Robin Williams, a fine, talented actor, was wasted in this load of pants. It was chronic. Need I say more?"
1,Nine Months Movie DVD,"I purchased this movie because I like it, but it won't play in my DVD player. When I purchased it I was warned that it was region specific, however I thought it would play on Australian equipment. Very disappointed."
2,"Just emulation, nothing more.","Like a lot of instructional DVD's, this one is pretty much pure emulation without any insight. You will learn to play the tunes that he teaches you, step-by-step, slow motion, ad nauseum, but you will not learn any improv tricks or secrets. Nothing to really get you going on your own. I would skip this one."
2,"Keep in mind, original remotes are needed","The reason I decided to buy the OmniRemote for my Visor was that I had lost most of my remotes for my electronics on a move recently, and I thought this could replace them all quickly and easily. To my disappointment, I soon realized that all original remotes were needed to program this module. So I ended up having to go to Wal-Mart and buy another universal remote, program it using the included codes, and use that Universal Remote to program the OmniRemote. What a waste of time, effort and money. The Sony Universal remote I bought was much easier to setup and use, it costed about 75% less, and none of the original remotes were neccesary because a list of manufacturers codes was included. Why the OmniRemote doesn't include such a list of codes is beyond me. The OmniRemote is only a wise buy if you already have all your remotes and you don't want to keep any of them on your coffee table."
5,"a peruvian admirer, enamorado","could not pass by without praising this wonderful cd from a tremendous artist. A pity it did not bring a picture on the cover. The live performance is magical, the voice is beautiful, as always. ROMANTICA, MISTERIOSA, MARAVILLOSA! THANK YOU AND PLEASE GIVE US MORE. un Gran Cariño desde Peru"
3,Not for me. However...,"I was not thrilled with this film as it reminded me of a few others which I will not list as it might give something away. However, this film was VERY well made. It is definitely worth seeing. The acting was good as was the directing."
1,SLEEP,"I SAW THIS ITEM ON DR. OZ AND CLAIMS IT WORKS WITH STRESS ALSO, I READ A REVIEW FROM HERE AND IT SAID IT MAKES YOU SLEEPY. I HAVE FOUND OUT THAT NONE OF THIS WORKS FOR ME."
1,Trainwreck,"This movie is so incredibly bad on all levels that I must watch it every time it's on TV. I do not have a comprehensive review to offer, that would be a waste of time. I just want to express how genuinely horrible this is and perfect for people who are into bad sci-fi (and I know you're out there). Don't buy. But don't miss it either."
3,Not savage enough,"I bought this movie because I like Sean Patrick Flanery, but I have to say the storyline is lame and not scary at all. The premise of the story is that the earth is dying, yet again, and there is another planet similiar to earth and they send SEan as well as other people to check out the planet. The so called monsters are grizzly bears from like the prehistoric times. Whatever! It wasn't bad, but truly it's not worth buying. I think this movie was probably on the sci fi channel. Save your money."
2,A waste of time and money...,"'Double Vision' is double terrible...the film comes off to a good start and the plot is an intriguing one I must admit...but just when you think that the story is going somewhere, it goes nowhere...The film is confusing and the ending did not make any sense at all....trust me you will not be surprised....the only thing I had to recommend this film was the intriguing plot, but even that went nowhere and I was so disappointed, especially since this is a Mary Higgins Clark story....totally pointless adaption which could have worked at the hands of a capable writer...a remake would be appreciated....a worthy Clark adaption would be ""A Cry in the Night"", which alos contains a badly executed ending, but a great story and actual suspense....that one gets 4 stars so check it out instead..."
2,"So, That's Why Naveen Likes Old Women?","Viewed: 2/13Rate: 42/13: Double Vision surprisingly has no nudity. For a film of this type, it has nothing going for it. There is 90 minutes to kill going through the motions, and then the last 2 minutes has an unexpected twist to finish it off. The overall acting by the cast is weak, and probably of all, Naveen Andrews fares the worst. For the type of a role that Kim Cattrall undertook in Double Vision, it is definitely has Juliette Binoche's name written all over it. Luckily for us, she did Damage with Jeremy Irons, an infinitely better film. All in all, Double Vision has no energy about it."
2,Shallow and short,Not very valuable. Each chapter is very short and very shallow. Not much to this book at all. I would not recommend it.
1,item not listed properly,Amazon needs to update the listing. I was not happy when I opened the package to find that the fans were 144mm not 14mm as advertised.
1,Almost unreadable,"This author could not have had an editor; this book reads like the product of a vanity press. I bought it despite what I now realize was a very accurate assessment by the previous reviewer, because I was doing research on the ATF. However, the insights into the workings of the ATF are drowned in the author's personal whining about his incompetent superiors and co-workers in addition to the very poor writing and structure. I have read several other books about the ATF. This is by far the weakest and least informative."
3,It was alright,"This is the story of a woman who is trying to find herself, after a successful modeling career that she she ends to her mother's dismay. Shawni is also having man problem. The book was ok, but at times it the storyline moved to slow for me."
5,Very entertaining!,"I really enjoyed it. It was fresh in telling about a common theme, and it was VERY entertaining. I liked that the story seemed to be about one thing but was about so much more, and that it wasn't all so obvious, and that the characters weren't all holier than thou making all the right decisions. The message was clear but the did not have to hit you over the head with it. The dialogue was so much fun, and I laughed out loud alot. I finished this book in three days because I kept wanting to see what happended next, and found myself still thinking about the characters, and wishing Shawni well. The end left me wanting more, but I won't go into specifics because I hate when reviews give away the story line, that is nof fair to the reader, but it is definitely an entertaining story and I would read future books by this author. Keep up the great work Philana Marie Boles."
3,Nothing out of ordinary,"Mostly common sense tips.. I don't know what I expected from such a book, to be honest. I shouldn't have bought it, because I kinda knew all the advice inside already."
5,submission to God,I have not finished reading this book yet but I already am learning what it truly means to be submissive to God as well as be an intercessor
5,A Wonderful Resource,"I had this book several years ago and someone borrowed it (or I gave it to someone!) I wanted to make sure that I always had a copy on hand because it contains valuable nuggets regarding prayer that I always want to remember, things like the power of Holy Spirit led prayer and the results when we follow his leadings. The impact of a believers spirit led prayer has the power to change nations!"
4,Learning when to stand,It is hard when you know the life that God has called you to when you are called to be an intercessor. In this book you learn that it is not for those who do not have faith. Faith that God will lead you to places that you do not expect and you need to learn to hear the voice of God. This book shows how the life of an intercessor is very serious work. I thought that I had reached all that I could as an intercessor until I read this book and it then changed my life.
4,For the most part....great job,"The album is pretty good, J. Moss is always awesome with his vocals. Has great range and a unique sound that is similar to a computer program. Those Clark/Moss folks are crazy with the singing. Some of the tracks seemed to sound the same. Being that J. Moss has produced/written for just about everyone in the business i feel like i've heard his CD even before he had his solo stuff. Kind of oversaturated with runs. Keep it simple sometimes. Mass choir sound on tracks when you know he did all the backing vocals himself. Sounds like a million J. Moss' singing. I'm just being honest. I gave it 4 stars because i think sometimes i listen very hard being that i am a singer myself, i got all the little extras. God bless him though, he's got it."
5,good start!,"This book is fun to read and inspiring, because the authors seam to love what they write about. Sometimes, however, the style is a little close to ""commercial advertising"". The concepts and visions sound evident, the technology is explained at the right level of abstraction. If you have time, read this book as an introduction to Corba before buying a real programmer's guide to corba."
3,One perspective on the Aqueducts,"The famous quote of Frontinus, commissioner of public water works under Trajan:""With such an array of indispensable structures carrying so many waters, compare, if you will, the idle Pyramids or the useless, though famous, works of the Greeks!"" Perhaps the Aqueducts of Rome, with its scientific shortcomings, does not have the audience of the Strategems. But it shows that those Romans knew how to get things done: a city of one million had a water supply comparable to a metropolis today. The famous quote recalls the effort of the Romans to distinguish their culture by outdoing all others in utility and sheer size."
5,I Love it.,I love it I ride whenever possible. My family has lost all male members to ALS. I really believe that I am next but I enjoy my time reading Harley Davidson books and riding.
2,Save Your Money -- Very Skimpy,"This ""book"" is a waste of money. I put the word ""book"" in quotes because in fact this little tract is less than 10,000 words. That's only about one-tenth the length of an average book. Furthermore, the ""author"" (also in quotes) has terrible spelling and grammar. Although it appears that Wegner did work for Michael Jackson, it seems Wegner barely met him. Wegner has hardly any information about Jackson. He ""reveals"" that boys would sometimes sleep in Jackson's room (which Jackson himself has said many times) and that Jackson would sometimes hug boys or sit close to them on a golf cart, both of which Jackson himself has shown in his recent ""Home Movies"" special. I'm sorry I wasted my money on this!"
1,A Very Sad Attempt!,The first thoughts that came to mind as I read this book were if Mr.Wegner observed one-tenth of which he stated he did with Mr. Jackson and young men Mr. Wegner should be charged with aiding abetting and accessory to a crime.In my years of reading I've read more fiction that seemed believable than what Mr.Wegner claims is truth and based in fact in his book.It comes across as a sad attempt to obtain money from his previous employer. I won't even bother going into detail on the spelling and spacing in the book that in and of itself is hurtful to his credibility.I can only conclude that Mr.Wegner was suffering from visual delusions during his employment with Mr. Jackson and had great hopes of wealth from his attempt at writing a book about a man who has given so much of his time and wealth to the needy selflessly.
4,EXCELLENT,"Orpheus was a very strange band: they recorded soft songs--what we'd now label soft rock--but filtered their work through Sgt. Pepper. Lots of ornate arrangements.Of their four albums, this first is their most diverse. Listen to the vibraphone on ""Congress Alley,"" approaching jazz rock. As aggressive as these guys got.Soon, the band went softer: ""I Can't find the time to tell you,"" is representative of where they went after this album. But for a folk/ballad band, these guys embraced both 60s musical ambition and quasi psychedelia--look at their album covers.Not being able to choose sides in the polarized 1960s makes Orpheus more interesting"
5,Great reference,"I found this book to be extremely helpful in studying for my OS PhD prelims. It really lays out the issues and presents solutions taken by SVR4, BSD, Mach, and Solaris in a clear fashion. Excellent detail. The Mach stuff is great, but it looks like it was almost cut and paste from the research papers. This book isnt for novices. I recommend using the BSD4.4 book as well. Both books dont look at Windows at all (for obvious reasons), so a look at the Dinosaur book (Operating System Concepts) is helpful as well for the case studies. You should have aclear understanding of OS after finishing this book."
4,"Fun, PG Adventure","Being an engineer in my late 40s--with career and family--I have limited time and energy to stay up late to read for fun. Usually, I get to bed late and try to read a little before passing out. Most times, I'll read one or two chapters of a book after two weeks and then give up. But occasionally a book grabs me. Well, Cyclops kept my attention and I looked forward each night to a half-hour of relaxing with this book.For the concerned parent: some mild language, and one brief mention of premarital sex. Wouldn't it be nice if books were rated by some parent organization?"
3,Reading with Tequila,"This was the 6th novel from the Dirk Pitt series that I have read. I enjoy series. Many claim that they have no literary value since they aren't always capable of standing alone. I don't believe that and very much enjoy revisiting with favorite characters as they embark on new journeys. Dirk Pitt is essentially the James Bond of the sea and Clive Cussler's novels are rather heavily geared towards men. I like adventure and am a large fan of political incorrectness, even when directed towards women. This particular book included cosmonauts, a blimp and Fidel Castro. Random things coming together and working well, as it does here, makes me particularly giddy. I would have rated the book highter but I couldn't help comparing it to other books in the series and the female protagonist was unintentionally annoying."
5,Another Clive Cussler classic,"This contains all the important elements of an enjoyable book. It's got the action, adventure and typical near impossible and impossibe scenarios that make Cussler's books so great. I have read nine of Cussler's ""Dirk Pitt adventures"" they are all excellent, and completly enjoyable books, this is no exception.This adventure has battles on military compounds in Cuba to battles on the moon. And as always Dirk Pitt is suave, fearless, and inventive. And for anyone out there who loves classic cars, you'll enjoy brief descriptions of Pitt's collection. So go ahead and help yourself, I'm sure you will enjoy it and many others as well."
4,Great,Lots of fun and really easy to stay interested. I love the dirk Pitt series. Clive Custer is a great writer.
5,One of his best,"Cyclops is the one Cussler book that makes me laugh out loud every time I read it. The other books have some dry humor, but the premise of this one is so out there, I mean there is a fight between the Americans and the Soviets on THE MOON. Aside from that, the premise is actually realy cool and this one is a very interesting read."
4,Very good Sci-fi / robot film,I liked very much this film that shows the main problems with robots. A default or a person who want to do bad things 'could' make robots dangerous... Even if it's not our future... tomorrow never knows... I always see this film with great pleasure but my favorite film on robots is Blade runner...
2,Not for people who seek high quality results.,"I was intrigued by the idea of miniature wooden ""statues"" but was disappointed when reviewing this book. On a technical basis it does not always provide step by step instructions to achieve a result. You typically get a before and after picture. On a personal basis, the finished products are generally quite crude which does not appeal to me. I'll stick to scrollsawing larger items!"
2,Cumbersome and slow.,"Adobe promised big things for inDesign. They delivered on most all of them. Unfortunately, in their desire to make this program all things to all people compatible, they made it slow loading and cumbersome to work with. Even a two or three page document can take many seconds to load. Stick with Quark XPress until Adobe can get this one right."
5,A hit!,"Following up on his successful Honus & Me, Gutman has brought back time traveling Joe Stoshack. This time, he goes back to 1947 to meet Jackie Robinson-and when he arrives, Joe is an African American kid. Gutman uses this plot technique to show the reader the kinds of prejudice Robinson endured. In turn, Robinson teaches Joe, through example, that no one can make you feel inferior without your permission. The story is simple yet rewarding, a good bet for a reluctant reader who loves baseball or collects sports cards.The continuation of a series that is hitting .400"
5,"The Hindu Business Lines: 4-D, 3-B-C, Cue-2-Do and 1 Stone","""What a whiff of fresh air. Grenough elucidates the techniques through a graceful 'how-to' and simple language... OASIS comes as 'a clear stream of reason' in 'the dreary desert sand of dead habit,' as in Rabindranath Tagore's Gitanjali.""D. Murali, Financial Daily from THE HINDU group of publications"
4,"Fun with poison, Christie style...","Christie's novels where poison is the murder weapon are the most fun. Christie, who worked in a dispensary during World War I, had a certain amount of technical knowledge of various poisons; thus her fondness for it as a weapon in her books. Poison can be used by anyone; it is therefore the perfect weapon for Christie. This one is a particularly jolly romp complete with illicit affairs and mistaken identities. Light in tone, this is not one of her more serious books, but it is extremely clever and, as always, entertaining."
5,Wonderful product for excellent cleanup!,"I have had my computer for a couple of years now, and I have always wondered if there was ever a product out there to help me rid my computer of WASTE. Well this product was recommended to me by a family member, and I am impressed as to how well it does!! I have never had so much success with one ALL-IN-ONE product as I have the System Mechanic 6 Professional, and the fact that it came with Virus Protection was and added bonus for me too. If your computer is slower than slow I definately recommend that you use this product to get rid of the Unnecessary Junk on your system, and keep up to date with the latest Viruses out there. I don't think I will ever go back to MCCAFEE again!!"
1,Don't waste your Bucks,"I have used System Mechanic since they first came out, using 3.0. I upgraded to 4, 5, and now 6. I have a new hot rod system, with plenty of speed and ram. System mechanic (memory hog) will crash or hang my system. It runs in the background and does it tasks per scheduling, even though you may be right in the middle of working on something..... like a hot game of Pogo Pool, in which event you would lose. I liked the added features of 5 over 4, but don't waste your money on System Mechanic 6. Wait for them to work the bugs out and then only install if you have lots of ram and a fast system. Keep using system mechanic 4 it that is the case.Also, I rate this -5 but it doesn't give you that option."
1,Listen to Bufkin,I had a similar problem to L Bufkin's. My XP home edition crashed & burned on contact with System Mechanic 6 Pro. I'm still working with microsoft to try to repair the damage.
3,May cause network problems,"Beware of fixing security flaws found and suggested to be fixed by this product. I have rather strong suspision that it has affected one of my home LAN computers. After installing SM6, running some checks and fixes, and finally uninstalling I'm not able to reach this computer's shared resources from other computers on the LAN anymore.Read about a similar problem:[...]"
1,Windows 7 Compatible ... ???,"I used an older 4 GB drive for years on my Windows XP machine. No problems. Neither it nor this newer drive that is listed as ""Windows 7 Compatible"" function with Windows 7. I can copy files to the drive but cannot use the secure software."
3,Dirve is not very durable,"I purchased this drive to replace my 16GB SanDisk Cruzer. My two requirements for the new drive were (1) Faster read/write and (2) retractable USB connector. I found both advertised in this product. Once I received the drive I compared the R/W speeds. While marginally faster than the Cruzer, it never met its advertised R/W speeds (Source machine was an Intel i5 running Windows 7 with 8GB RAM). As to quality of the physical drive, it falls short of the Cruzer. The casing is a far thinner gauge plastic and the USB connector does not stay fully retracted. Odd that Verbatim did not include a $1 lanyard with their $125 product. The eyelet for the lanyard also feels as if will break without much use. It is due to these factors that this drive only rates 3 out of 5 stars."
2,Grossly overpriced,A simple drive that is no faster or better than an comparable drive you could buy for $5. The encryption software is no better than free software you can download for flash drives.
1,"Big Man, Big Ego, Little Morals","Lots of country-boy-grows-up stories to warm the heart (the ice cube episode and the wrong shoe size stood out particularly). Yet the older he gets, the less we like him. Lots of Islamic proselytizing, yet he glosses over his illegitimate children and his childish contract renegotiation. Latter half of this book seems to have been vetted by his Svengali-like agent David Falk. The overwhelming theme of this book is ""anything wrong in my life, not my fault"". A great role model for his generation."
5,Killer flamboyant movie about everyone's fav 18th C castrato,Wow!!! I watch this movie time and again. The acting is first-class and the story enthralling. Farinelli is amazing.........and that is NO exaggeration!
5,Farinelli-Great movie,"I saw this movie in the theartre when it was new. It's such a beautiful film to look at, and the music is so incredible you forget that it's in Flemmish and you're reading subtitles.If you like this movie I would also reccomend reading ""Cry to Heaven"" by Anne Rice. It's a story of the castrati and gives you an understanding of that time in history. It's a great compliment to the movie. As one has nothing to do with the other it's just a very fortunate coincidence.It's sad that there are no recordings of these beautiful voice as this custom was stopped and those who had performed had died before machanical recordings were popular. I beleive there was one who was actually recorded by Thomas edison on his new invention.It's something anyone alaive today will never be able to hear."
4,Excellent,"Sumptious presentation, missing only some motivational aspects of the principal characters. Generally faithful to 18th century scene and identifiably based on the biography of Carlo Broschi as summarized by Groves. Not for the fastidious, however."
3,Historically inaccurate,"A good source of entertainment, but historically inaccurate. For one thing, Farinelli famously DID NOT sing Handel's music; he sang for the rival company in London and maintained a very antagonistic relationship with Handel."
4,Mostly satisfied,"It solved the network printing problem when the printer's internal card failed, but there is now a nagging delay for print jobs to start."
4,"Rollercoaster of emotion, complex family relationships","I went into this movie expecting something like Soul Food meets Ma Dear's Family Reunion, but what I found instead was a story about a family that centers on its matriarch, who is not domineering but loving, a father who is wise but strong and siblings who seem to function more as friends or neighbors than as a close-knit unit. Then there is Robert and his up-and-down/on-again off-again love-hate relationship with his wife. There are some editing issues and I question the film's ending. Overall, some very different editing choices would have highlighted the talents of the experienced actors more and would have made this a much more compelling story. It is a good conversation starter for families dealing with a series of complex issues, where ""just pray about it"" is not the only answer. A movie the entire family can enjoy together."
5,Mini Tiller,This Tiller is an excellent product. It has been very usefulin my garden whether digging up weeds or digging a small trenchfor a sprinkler line.
4,C-shells fit well and bring the sounds of the seashore,"My daughter has a Fisher-Price fish aquarium night-light/music box attached to her crib... and it's her favorite sleep aid. Unfortunately, it's pretty battery-hungry and was eating Alkaline C batteries like popcorn. I have a bunch of NIMH AA batteries that I use for various remote controls and video game controllers, so I thought it'd be nice to leverage those and start using rechargeables in the aquarium. It has worked out great! The C-shells fit well in the aquarium (so the fact that their outer diameter is close to the max size for a C battery doesn't cause any problems in my application). And they hold my various Sony, Energizer, and Sanyo Eneloop NIMH rechargeable AAs just fine. I naturally have to replace batteries a bit more frequently than I did with true C's (AAs just don't have the same energy capacity), but I'm not having to run out and buy new batteries any more... which is great!"
2,I promptly returned this item!,"It's so hard to find a good ladies' digital watch anymore, especially if you don't want a sport watch. I was so excited when I found this watch, but that excitement turned into disappointment when I actually received the item. The leather band is poor quality the digital numbers are barely readable! In the photo on amazon, it looks like there's a lot of contrast between the white numbers and dark background, but there really isn't. I had to angle the watch directly in the light in order to read the time off the digital display, but even then it was difficult! I returned this watch after 2 days."
3,fine music and videos; lame disk,"This is a collection of 40 music videos from a great selection of industrial groups -- Clock DVA, Chrome, Frontline Assembly, Einsterzende Neubauten, Psychic TV, Pigface, Die Krupps, Test Department, Christian Death, Rosetta Stone, Executive Slacks, etc. Not every video is brilliant but the music is consistently good.My problem with this dvd is the very lame formatting problems. There are some songs that don't allow you to advance so you have to fast-foward through them (and they seem to be the longest songs on the disk!) or go back to the main menu. It seems like they had to work at making this so lame! It would also be nice if you could check off the videos you want to hear and then have the disk play just those songs, but that is not a possibility.This is a great selection of industrial music -- you even see three examples of that rarity, blonde goths -- but you WILL be frustrated by the disk!"
2,Tech probs,I bought this disk off the shelf and had problems getting it to play. After 6 or so trys it played. It's a good disc although the sound could be better. I've exchanged my disc in hope of getting one that will play straight away. A booklet would have been very nice...
2,Worked Well For A Month,"Shifted fine for the first month of road riding. Then the chain began skipping over or jumping off the 4th and 8th gear. After replacing it with a Shimano Tiagra cassette I examined the SRAM closely. I found some of the coggs on the SRAM had bent. I'm 6'5"" and 240LBS, a klidesdale! Still the cassette should have used a stronger alloy for durability."
4,PLAY BALL,"Before I bought this game I heard some bad reviews but the only other choice was TRIPLE PLAY 2001.I do not like the TRIPLE PLAY series so I got ALL STAR BASEBALL.When I started playing this I realeased that its really fun.It seamed like the best game.But then I found the downsides to it.It is missing instant replay,create a player, and only has 1 stadium........... the HALE OF FAME TEAM dosent include Babe Ruth,Ted Williams,Willie Mayes, Ty Cobb,Mickey Mantle,Joe Dimmagio, or Honus Wagner.However the rosters are updated, this has the playoffs, a season mode, THE ALL STAR GAME,and an awesome HOME RUN DERBY.Despite all the bad things this is a really cool game,probably the best baseball game for GAME BOY."
3,Narcissism personified,"No one loves Ayn Rand more than Ayn Rand herself, and this is one of the most blatantly self-serving books ever written. Yes, there is some very good advise, but nothing that isn't readily available elsewhere without having to wade through such dribble as she constantly bombards the reader, lest her superior intellect and super-human abilities be forgotten.For ardent fans of Ms. Rand this is probably a must have book; for the rest of us, while there is good advice buried within the pages, we must each decide whether it's worth putting on our boots to get it."
2,Only when I'm desperate...,"Like a reviewer below said, this magazine was good a while back. Try back in 2002. It used to have better tips and less filler. Now, it's all filler. Seriously. There are maybe 5 quizzes which don't say much, a ""dream decoder"" which is complete phooey, and yes, the many tweeny posters that I'd be embarassed to have on my wall, even if I were 11. I grew, but sadly, this magazine did not, let alone stay the same. Nothing is serious in here, it's like the magazines that tweenybopper brats read.Age reccomendation: 9-12Simply put, this magazine is like M Magazine, but not as infantile."
1,horrible slant against moms,"The slant against stay at home moms in the ""The Mommy Myth was intolerable. The authors celebrate selfishness and use this book it appears, to ease their own guilt. ""The Mommy Myth"" serves that purpose only and is an insult to every woman, career or stay at home, mother or not. There is a definite political (I don't sit home baking cookies) feel to the writing and I get the impression, it is the authors' own inadequacies that make them lash out against what other moms are doing and doing quite well. The message should be different strokes for different folks and that would unite women. Instead, they choose to make stay at home moms look plastic, as if what they are doing is somehow un-natural. Moms actually being the ones doing the mothering seems to tick these two off and it leaves the reader wondering why. ""The Mommy Myth"" is not a book I could ever recommend."
5,More than expected,"I ordered the 22 to 24 inch bone for my dog. It arrived quickly and was more like 36 to 40 inches which was nice. The dog really liked it. It costs a lot to ship so I would only go this route if you cant go to a store. (I am in Iraq) The company had great fast service, if they sell other things that ship cheaper than a 4 foot bone I will use them again."
4,LUCI likes them,Luci is park husky park Great Dane she is 100 pound dog and chews these up alot 1 week not tobad the other I bought from the name brand stores last 1 day
1,Kettler has discontinued this tricycle in the 10 inch size,"I ordered this for my 2-yr-old's birthday and they sent me a 12 inch version. Sadly, my husband didn't notice the size problem before assembling the trike and wrapping it to give to her. When I tried to exchange for the smaller size, Kettler told me they no longer make the 10-inch. The larger one is too big for a 2-yr-old. So if you're looking for the smaller size, try a different brand! Bummer to have to give my daughter a trike she couldn't use, then disassemble to send back, run down to Target for a different one, then assemble that. I wish Amazon would take down this product entry so nobody else has the same problem I had."
3,Let the reader beware - this is more novel than letters,"I, like the many reviewers of this book, was enthralled and inspired by this collection of letters when I first read it 25 years ago. I have recommended it to many friends. At the time I would have given it five stars or even more if they were available. Irving Stone writes in his preface ""My aim has been to edit the 1670 pages of material down to a swiftly flowing, continuous normal-sized book..."" He succeeded but even 25 years ago I was a little disturbed by the complete absence of indications where exactly Mr. Stone had done his cutting, or his editing. Today, in the age of internet we can now do some easy checking. The unabridged letters are on the net and reveal that basically what this Dear Theo is, is another novel written by Irving Stone. There is almost no resemblance to the original letters. The novelist has used his talents and the raw material to create a beautiful saga. Worth reading, but let the reader beware."
2,Eleventh Insight: Don't write a book unless you know how to,"Redfield's books in a sentence: ""Suddenly, an orgasmic rush of energy sent me whirling into a new spiritual awakening"". I'm sorry, but you cannot use the words suddenly, orgasmic, and energy-level 150 times in 10 pages. Redfield's insights may be worthwhile, but I found his rudimentary style of writing to be too distracting to enjoy any of the insights. Although I do admit that the second book was written at a more advanced level than the first, I still find it hard to believe that it became so popular among so many people. Are people really that desperate for spirituality in their lives? If so, they might enjoy a book more along the lines of Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse. At least Hesse knows how to tie a spiritual theme into a novel. One thing is clear, Redfield may have some very inspirational and new-aged theories, but his use of language is atrocious."
2,"A message of non violence, a war against drugs.","After the tv series, with the same title and actor & character a movie its not as good as the tv series. The story is very slow. There should be some more suspence & action full movements. David Carradine seemed a super human. Its very far from real life. He should make film like his tv series."
5,Haynes Bibles,"Excellent manuals, always have been. I have, over the last 35 plus years bought many Haynes manuals (Original Mini, Triumph Herald, MG Midget, Austin Healy Sprite, to name a few) each and every time they have saved me from spending outrageous sums on ""real mechanics"". Thank you."
2,One of the best known of Telemann's mid-period passions,"As Telemann came round to Matthew every four years in his church duties it is worth noting that this is the Matthäus-Passion for 1746 (TWV5:31). It is a relatively short work that should fit onto a single CD, and the two other recordings available by Max (Capriccio) and Seeliger (Christophorus) do so. This recording, conducted by Ulrich Stolzel, despite being well under the 80 minute limit is spread onto 2CDs - for no discernable reason. Of the three recordings Max would be preferred by those wanting period instruments, Seeliger for those preferring a more ""churchy"" choir sound. Stolzel falls between these two stools. On instrumental playing and soloists it is again Max who wins the laurels.Other recordings by Stolzel than can be more warmly recommended are his two CDs of Telemann cantatas that have recently been reissued in a budget 3CD box along with Max's recording of a Telemann Missa Brevis."
2,Cradle doesn't fit the 60 gig version of I-Audio X5,"I looked for information on whether this thing accommodated the 60 gig version of the I-Audio X5, but could not find any information on it. The cradle is too narrow to fit the 60 gig unit. I took a stab at it, and lost. Time to get the dremmel out."
4,Organic Chemistry,"This is a very good basic text for organic chemistry, one of the newest ones out there. I liked the order in which topics were presented but others liked an older text better. The student solutions manual and study guide are a must."
4,Way before expected,I received this item way before it was expected and it was in great condition! I will use again:)
4,Organic Chemistry Book Review,"This book was purchased from an unbeatable price here at Amazon, compared to the community college I purchased it at. Saved over 60%"
3,Maybe It's Just me....,"I am a forever fan of Mary, but this new album has to grow on me. Right now at this very moment I'm not excited like most of the people writing reviews. I miss the old Mary. I know her life is different now but why does the feel of the music have to change. I still say you'll have to buy it and listen for yourself. And I'm still trying hard to have that excitement everyone else has. So far I'm only feeling 3 songs. But you know what you like better I do. I miss the old Mary..."
4,This a great album!,"I gave this album 4 stars, because I think that there are a few cuts that brought the project down, but let me just say that if I were you - I would BUY THIS ALBUM. If I could, I would have given it 4.5 stars actually. This album really does show how Mary has grown as an artist. It's fresh, fun, soulful, and reflective. Mary blew my mind in college with What's the 411 and My Life and this ranks up there with those; but she is more polished and sophisticated with these tracks. Although, Mary has grown up, the album still has an urban, hip-hop appeal. Mary is sincere and authentic. She is quite clearly, still ""the queen""."
5,THE QUEEN HAS DONE IT AGAN!!!,"This is the most solid R&B album i've heard in a very long time including Mary's 2003 effort ""Love & Life"". In the recent years of OK artist dropping OK music Mary shows the world how its supposed to be done. ""The Breakthough"" starts of with the bangger ""No One Will Do,"" from the moment the beat drops you know your just in for a real treat. This is an album that can be played from start to finish. Mary does old soul music proud on ""I Found My Everything"" and ask for everyone to take her as she is on ""Take Me As I Am"". Mary continues to put her heart and soul out for the world to see. Keep doin ya thang Mary, right now its all about you."
4,SHE IS THE QUEEN,"I don't think there will ever be a perfect Mary J Blige CD but this one is one of her releases that is close to perfection. Unlike 94's ""My LIfe"" this cd does not contain the pain and dispair, which I love about ""My Life"". This CD shows Mary maturing vocally, as an artist, and as a woman. Stand out songs include ""NO ONe Else"", ""Enough Cryin"", ""Father In You"", and the remake of U2's ""One."" The latter is a testament to her vocal maturity and the fact that she is confident in herself now. To take on a U2 song is an amazing thing to do especially if you can pull it off. Still not the most gifted vocalist, Blige is here to stay. I must say that I am a big fan of the Queen and Queen Mary deserves the crown...."
4,Mary Trully Evolving,"Man, Mary has trully made an ample number of soul stirring contributions to the hiphop/soul genre. What is very apparent is that she is constantly growing and becoming more sensitive to the trial & tribulations of life. She has also overcome addition, low-self esteem (more to come)"
5,aWESOME,"MARY NEVER CEASES TO AMAZE ME. AS A DIE REAL HARD MARY FAN, I KNOW EVERYTHING THAT SHE HAS DONE. THIS ALBUM IS THE BEST OF THE BEST. SHE STILL DELIVERS HER HEART TO US AND YOU WON'T BE ABLRE TO STOP PLAYING THIS CD. SHE IS AWESOME ALL THE WAY THROUGH. I HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO THIS FOR THE PAST TWO DAYS AND I HAVE TO SAY I LOVE THE NEW MARY. MY GIRL IS BAD!!!! SHE HAS DONE IT AGAIN. ILOVE THIS ALBUM. HER VOICE IS MORE POWERFUL THAN EVER AND SHE LOOKS GREAT. THIS GIRL HAS REALLY SURPASSED ALL EXPECTATIONS."
5,Hidden Track,"I love this CD. I bought it for track 4 (Be Without You), however, my favorite thing on this CD is the hidden track. Once track 16 (One) is done playing some other song comes on and it just makes me smile. I've been a fan of MJB for a long time and this is my favorite CD of her so far. Happy listening!"
2,2 stars just for effort,Mary J. Blige's album is a good album if your a girl and went through what she did. But I bought this album because of Be Without You and because I wanted to support her but when i listened to it i was disappointed to the fullest. The only good songs one the album is Be Without You and No More Crying. The c.d is really a autobiography with music. It's one of those albums that you know it's good but you dont like it
2,Screech!,"The production by Jam and Lewis is grand. I'm a certainly a fan of the instrumentation on this LP. However, Blige's voice is simply screeching. Her vocals seem to induce my brain to want to abuse myself. The vocal character is that of nails on a chalkboard. Simply horrid vocals, simply great instrumentation and production."
5,Mary sounds the happiest she's ever been!,"This cd is great. A great collection of good RnB music. I was hoping this kind of music was still around. All her songs make her sound happy and at peace with her life. Song #10 is one of my faves, as she goes through her past albums and describes what was happening at that time in her life. What's cool is that she was awesome in the past and she's awesome now. The music is different but still great. Get this cd!"
3,Relaxing and pleasant.,"Mrs Warda has a beautiful voice and this CD showcases it well. If you want something to relax to and just rest this is probably it. I had been looking for something to dance to but I am still not disappointed. The songs are between 6:30 and 14:29 minutes long which adds to their soothing nature to me. It's nice to have music that isn't just a snippet.I don't recommend this particular CD for bellydancers, if you are looking for something to dance to try some of her more recent work."
1,Terrible mumbling throughout,"This is a terrible cooking DVD. You can hardly make out what he is saying, mumbling his way through the recipes."
5,Sublime!,What an outstanding CD this is! I have always admired Sam; I once had the pleasure of seeing him live with Doug Matthews and Anthony Cole.They made such joyous music together. This rhythm section is without compare. Jaki Byard will be added to my list of all time great piano players. He has a style all his own. Tony Williams and Ron Carter are indisputably the best... the work they did with Miles will attest to that.And Sam himself... this is a CLINIC in how to play Jazz tenor! A killer quartet... such style and panache! Run to buy this CD. You won't be disappointed.
5,smiles,Nice this was exactly what my girl was looking for after losing her last one. Shopping e was feast and the price was great.
2,Errors in the recipes,"As with her book, Ayurvedic Cooking for Westerners, there are recipes with glaring errors in them in this book. In many cases proportions are off, there is too much liquid in the recipe or not enough. Not so serious for kichadis or curries, but for some of the desserts and snacks, such errors create a disastrous mess. When trying new recipes from this book I always have a pencil nearby so that I can note bad recipes. The book is an excellent reference for eating for your dosha and there are some recipes that are very good. But beware of the bad ones! Less experienced cooks might find it frustrating to cook from this book."
2,Just an uncomfortable glue patch.,"These were a silly purchase that I only used once, and now sit in my bathroom cupboard. I suppose they would work over a nightly basis, but would quit working the day you quit using them. I suggest just gracefully aging as intended by nature."
4,they work,"im trying these things out so far so good, im a man and feel kind of weird using them but i need to do some thing about these 11 on my forehead, i have tried botox 2 time but only lasted a month."
4,They really do work!,"I'm 26 years old and started noticing frown lines between my brows a few years ago. As they have become more noticeable, I've searched for ways to combat the problem. I stumbled across Frownies online one day and decided to give them a try because they were so cheap. I've been using them for a month now, and I can tell a difference. The fine lines are still there. However, the deep indentations that were starting to develop are gone. I did skip a night once and could tell a difference the next day, so be sure to wear them faithfully. Also, I have to wear them in the shower for several minutes before I can pull them off. I want to note that I AM NOT a rep for a company as one of the reviews implied. I'm a real woman with beauty concerns, and I would recommend this product to others with the same problem."
2,"All I can say is, ""OUCH!""","I followed the directions, and found them difficult to shape to the area I was placing it then holding it until it dried. The next morning I again followed the directions for removing it, and it is NOT as simple as described. It hurt like rip and left the tender skin red and irritated. Skin that I'm sure is not supposed to be stretched like that. lol I don't know if I have a pea sized head or if I put too much water, etc. Did not work for me. I did not wake up looking like a movie star. Quite the contrary!"
3,Short lasted the effects,They work fine and they do erase wrinkles for a short time; the effects last I guess just the first hours of the morning or nite then you see your wrinkles coming back! But they can help you if lets say you planning to go out for a date or a special occasion.
4,Can They Keep Up With My Wrinkles?,So far these seem to work fairly well. I have a VERY deep wrinkle between my eyebrows. If I wear a Frownie overnight it seems to lessen somewhat. The two problems I have are remembering to put one on every night and the comfort. Because of where the wrinkle is the edges and corners of the Frownie tend to jab me a little after it dries in place.
4,Neat-o Jack heads are a hoot.,"Halloween is such a weird holiday. We like the tamer side of Halloween and these little candles are a great addition. I love the movieTim Burton's The Nightmare Before ChristmasPoor Jack just want's to be adored instead of abhorred.These candles are well made. I received mine in good condition. The Jack heads are great but I really like the 2 orange pumpkins the most. Too bad they just don't sell a batch of those. The white in Jacks heads have more of a translucent appearance than a opaque white but still looks great, especially when lit. The only downside of these is that they are bit expensive. Regardless I'm glad I have them."
3,Michael Buble wants to be Bobby Darin,"The Bobby Darin influence on Michael Buble is obvious, though he does not electrify like Darin did. The DVD is enjoyable, and if you are a fan of Sinatra, Bennett, Connick Jr., you will like Buble. But of course, he pales in comparison to the master - Bobby Darin. Check out the ""Mack Is Back"" DVD to see a truly electrifying concert."
1,Caught In The Act (CD + Region 2 DVD),"I never recd this item, which I ordered on Nov 17.I have also sent three e-mails in this regard, which have received no response!!!12/19/10 It has arrived, on time for Christmas-Yay"
1,Beware of DVD's from foreign countries,"I ordered Micheal Buble's, ""Caught in the Act,"" as a gift to myself and for a friend as a gift. The CD played great. The DVD only works in laptops and NOT on a big screen tv. It says, REGION ERROR on the screen. Very Disappointed and embarresed. That is why the product is only $9.98."
1,Dissapointed,"I can't get rid of this, just because the single still makes it seem like Dangermouse had a reason for working with these guys on a track or two, even if the rest of the album does not defend that claim at all. It's like a puzzle I can't solve. I guess I'm OK with spending a dollar or two on a decent puzzle. Too bad though; I was hoping it would be worth real money."
3,We're On A Road To Nowhere,"This is a slick looking film- you get to see every crack in the wall and everyone looks suitably grubby in a typically Glaswegian sorta way.The film which starts off quite promisingly; a woman seeks revenge on a man who's wronged her in the past. And for the most part, it's very intriguing. Then we find out the big secret! And I personally felt it undermined much of what come before it. To think this woman would go to such an extent in order to get back at the man who killed her husband and child; it just doesn't have any credibility to it. I didn't believe she would do something like this.On the plus side, it's similar to ""The Brave One"" (ie. passive woman asserts herself) and it's a million times better than that film. Oh... much better"
4,Great debut ! We want more !!!,"Finally, another writer who writes a book about the U.S. Navy set in the age of sail. Although it started out a little bit slow at the beginning, this book will keep you turning the pages until the end.Young Snotty Matty Graves tells his story so real that you think you are there right with him.I already bought the next book in line and hope we will get many more.OTHER BOOKS RECOMMENDED WRITTEN BY : Charles D. White, Frank Eccles"
4,My daughter gives it a five!!,"A must have for any 7 - 14 year old! If they love High School Musical, they will love this!"
3,Excellent sexual tension but...!,"This was my first Anne Stuart, surprisingly. The story wasn't original but she does have a way with painting a scene with words. The only reason why I finished the story was because of the sexual tension between Christian and Lucinda. It was smokin for sure! He reminded me so much of a rake on a tv series I laughed out loud many times, thinking she must've modeled her hero exactly after him. I gave it three stars because the ending disappointed me!! I felt no growth for the hero!! His love for the heroine felt reluctant...like he chose her in the end because he just couldn't help himself and he caved...instead of having passionate, consuming love and adoration for her. He still felt like a cold jerk to me, though a completely charming one. I recommend it purely on its entertainment value, which is what a novel is supposed to be anyway I guess!"
4,Witty and great characters,"I want to give the first half of this book 5 stars, but the second half pulls it down to 4. I love the writing, it's witty and funny. This book is not like the usual historical romance: the hero is not a 'do - gooder' and the heroine is sharp tongued.I liked how the hero reluctantly fell in love with the heroine, but near the ending, his actions deviated from that notion for a bit, which was irritating. The heroine was a bit bland at the end.The suspense was really good."
5,This book is one of life's essentials!,"I have somehow managed to reach 20 without buying anything more in the way of makeup than lipstick, mascara and lip balm. The idea of buying foundation was scary enough, let alone knowing how to apply makeup properly. This book has eliminated the mystery of makeup and skincare. I believe every woman should own this book, it is essential in understanding your skin and enhancing your best assets."
1,This was published????!,"This is one of the most presumptious and arrogant works I have ever had to read. Doody's arguments are poorly presented, and the reader gets lost in her difficult, convoluted, circular explanations. The grammar and usage mistakes (fragments, run-on sentences and comma splices) detract from the overall message of the book. The topic is interesting, until you try to follow Doody through her presentation. Questions are posed, and if the reader expects an answer one is DISAPPOINTED. The explanation of the tropes of a novel make several unbending assumptions, and overreach the evidence. Not worth the money...and if it required reading for a class I am very sorry."
1,Avoid this!,"If you - like me - were blown away by Dirty Boogie and wanted to hear more of that style of Brian Setzer, then DO NOT get this album: it is nothing like the later work and is a huge disappointment. The re-release is presumably designed to cash in on the popularity of his more recent stuff."
1,His Worst Ever output,"I am a huge Brian Setzer fan. I own everything that the Stray Cats and their three members have ever put out. This is by far the worst album that anyone from the band has recorded. BSO, 68 CBS and even the ""Live Nude Guitars"" album were far better than this. To say that this is even worse than Brian's Bloodless Pharaohs stuff really shows just how shockingly poor this is. I owned it on vinyl when it first came out, and due to my wanting all of his output, I now own it on CD. That is the only reason anyone should buy this - if you are a collector. Buy It, Put it with your other CD's and leave it there. No other action necessary."
4,My review..,"So far, I really like this product. I've only listened to half of the CDs, but I think I have a good feel for it. What I like is that it is cumulative and continues to build from each lesson."
3,Brasilian Portuguese,"HiI bought this as a gift. But the person found those CD's too easy, as he already got a Brasilian Portuguese language base.I'm gonna try to sell it.HOWEVER if he didn't know anything about the language those CD's were gonna be perfetc - very easy to learn with.ThanksPatricia"
3,"Uninspiring 'Girl""","This movie is about an 18 year old girl --our heroine named Andrea-- who falls in lust and becomes a groupie for a local rock god, and through her misplaced passion she finds herself. And as entertaining as I found the movie to be, I found the plot highly unlikely and the sub-plots (such as the situations with Cybil, Darcy, and especially Greg) to be treated with little or no reverance. Andrea is treated by her supporting characters like some goddess when, if you really look at the persona she presents during the flick to her on screen friends and love interests, she isn't all that unique. I will say that Andrea's thinking process, brought to the viewer through frequent voice overs, brought to light a girl almost completely different than the girl she showed, one witty and fiery and a complete individual. This movie is good for a viewing or two, but it's definately not going to win any awards or rock the world with it's greatness."
2,READ THE BOOK,"The movie is cute. I am a big fan of Dominique Swain. However, this movie is based on a book by Blake Nelson by the same name. The man who made this film should be shot for what he has done to an amazing book. So many vital parts of Andrea's story are left out of the film. (example: Cybil is gay and shaves her head after a run in with Todd.) All I can say is, if you liked the movie, READ THE BOOK. Learn the real story. Then, write nasty letters to screenwriter telling him what an unforgiveable thing he's done........"
5,"Yes, you can find the music for this movie!","I LOVED this movie and was amazed that there was no soundtrack, especially when it centered around a (so-called) 'groupie' and the singer of a band! Finally I discovered that there is music available from The Color Green, apparently formed by Jon Kahn who provides the music that Todd Sparrow performs. 2 songs from the movie 'One Step Forward' and 'Girl' appear on ""the color green -- Jon Kahn"" [23587] and 'Look my way' and the song Cybil sings 'Never' are on the ""the color green -- Acoustic"" [71629]. I hope this helps other people who may have loved the music the way I did. Enjoy!"
2,Under Par...,I allways hate doing this but it's neccessary. This outline just doesn't cut it and I've read many. This was put together poorly.
5,Mommy Diagnostics: The Naturally Healthy Family's Guide to H,"I found this book extremely helpful in guiding me to be educated and organized with my interest in herbal health for my family. Shonda presents a balanced program for helping yourself and your family, and using conventional medical advice. Most of all she provides a professional approach to someone just beginning to investigate the idea of natural health, that makes it seem normal to take care of your family in this manner."
2,not so useful,"there are lots of recipes for herbs, but as a beginner, I found the book unhelpful. Not what I had in mind at all."
3,Shannon Elizabeth looks different!,"I've only seen clips of this movie so I can't say whether I like it or not. But I CAN say this: I think Shannon Elizabeth got implants! Watch this movie then watch American Pie. She may have had a growth spurt, but..."
3,Refurbished is not new,"Though I ordered a ""new"" unit, I received a ""refurbished one"" and was told by this vendor that new and refurbished were the same thing. I'm sure the product is fine, it's with the honesty of the vendor that I have an issue. I will avoid ordering from them in the future."
2,Beginning Algebra plus MyMathLab Student Starter Kit (10 Edition),"I am disappointed with my purchase of the book. The MyMath Student Starter Kit was not included. The book appears to be informative,but to be complete with the homework assignments it would be helpful to have the starter kit."
1,"1 Part French, 1 Part Narration, 1 part music plus some interview snippets","Save your money. Most of this expensive two disk set is narration half in French, half in English. The interviews of actual survivors are merely snippets of well known interviews, few of which are more than 45 seconds long. There are also interruptions by numerous, ridiculous period songs. I suppose they are intended to add flavor.The disk should be titled ""Titanic: A Foreign Language Narrative and musical with a couple of words from the Survivors""Only of value to those who have no knowledge of the infamous incident. I'd return it if I could but I had to open it to find out what it was. I think I'm out [...] bucks."
3,Only for the hardcore fan,"This attempt at a funny infomercial for Kinky Friedman's album Pearls in the Snow misses the mark. Dwight Yoakam's contribution consists mostly of expressing his incredulity at the participation of Don Imus. Don Imus' part is mostly wondering why he's not getting paid. Willie Nelson is best when he's singing and playing with Friedman. There are several segments with Kinky live, on stage. The diehard Kinky fan will probably enjoy this video - everyone else be warned - it is irritating."
1,Useless,"When reading the description, high hopes are raised on the potential reader. Mr. Sugar's selection is disproportionally biased towards boxing. Even Mr. Sugar's boxing selections are disappointing; quite a surprise considering his prestige in the field. Other popular sports such as football, soccer, and basketball are not covered in the depth that they deserve. Furthermore, his oppinions are rarely supported by facts, sometimes leading to disinformation . Sincerely, I regret buying it and I would not recommend it to any serious sports reader."
5,"Magnificent. Wonderful. ""Bonding"" instantaneously.",I got bonded to author right away. I found the right book to read at the right time. Well written. I can identify with Viola. a real treat. Lois Ann Yamanaka of Hawaii is like Sophia. Author should receive similar award - best Asian woman writer. Mabuhay!
4,"Hilarious Comedy for ""Middle Ages""",This movie is perfect for people in their 40ies and/or 50ies. It just hits the bullseye. Lean back and enjoy the ride.
5,Absolutely Wonderful,This was one of the best films i ever saw. I've watched it several times.Laughter is a great medicine.
4,funnyfunny,"Adults...you need to see this movie. It is not only funny, entertaining....but will make you laugh. If it doesn't...I don't know what to say."
2,Use with caution,"I was disappointed to find a number of errors in this book. When I cross-referenced some answers provided with text books and laws, they were not all correct. It was useful to have various subjects in one book to know what to study, but otherwise I would not use it for the actual material presented. I also found that it was not well organized. It seems some others found it to be great, but I scored well on the exam by studying notes, text books, and laws."
2,Some helpful information but dated testing advice,"I took the praxis exam shortly after I bought the book. My initial impression of the review book was that it appeared dated. After completing the test, my impression held true. This book has very little information in terms of reviewing the questions that will be on the test. It has a copy of an old praxis exam and some review materials. You will be better served in preparing for this test if you review the summaries at the end of each chapter in your text books from graduate school. Good luck!"
2,Not really useful.,"The book is helpful if you are the nervous type who needs reassurance that you're going to do okay on the exam. However, I didn't really find it that helpful, it certainly was way off on the content compared to the exam itself."
4,Good overview,"I used this book to study for the School Psyc Praxis exam and passed with a 780 in June 2007. Thompson's brief review of various concepts are helpful and relevant to the exam. His practice test questions are also helpful and some were very similar to actual questions. The only warning I have is that the incorrect answer choices on the practice test are easier to eliminate in his book than on the exam. If you study with this book, the study tips guide on the NASP website, and read the summaries from BP IV, you should pass!"
4,"Making the things passable, one bullet at a time","Thompson delivers useful tidbits of knowledge and test-taking hits with this light-weight thriller. He covers all of the major domains within School Psychology and sagely advises you to first consider your areas of ignorance and progressively move to your areas of strength. I, for one, had to extensively review case law and ethics. Others will likely find a need to review general psychological principles. Thompson assumes that you are aware of your strengths and weaknesses and is very capable of pointing you in the right direction if you indeed are aware. If not, however, preparation time will increase substantially. That being said, however, Thompson suggests highly recommended other sources (Thomas and Grimes, 2004; Hale and Fiorello, 2004) that will likely lead you to NASP Exam success."
1,Printer did not work.,The printer did not work. We have had the same printer for 5 years so we do know how to use it. It wa.s returned and seems to been taken care of.
2,Are You Kidding Me?!,"Sellers on here really should be drug-tested because anyone selling this POS for $280 must be a crack addict! This printer has always got an excuse to not just print like it's supposed to. Usually, it likes to give me crap that the ink cartridges aren't the overpriced ones that I should order from Dell directly, or that the ones I have in there are essentially counterfeit - like that should be any business of a printer's. Mine's got a date with my driveway coming up ""Office Space""-style. I owe it that much and I'm owed that much ;)"
1,Returned it the next day.,"I bought this boat for my 8yr old son. The only thing that worked on the boat was the light, it did not come with instructions, and the motor for life boat was broken when it arrived. We tried everything to get this boat to run nothing worked. Returned it the next day."
1,Shaughnessy 2 the search for relevance,"This book is the literary equivalent of the McRib, a desperate attempt to preserve a franchise without much thought or sense to behind it.After a career of lapping up the puss from sores of desperation created by his misery fostering master opus, Shaughness tries to foist this one on the public. Have you at long last no shame, Mr. Shaughnessy?This book is sophomoric in every way, conception, execution and style. Do something more intellectually enriching with your time. Perhaps a Joyce Dewitt rerun of CrossWits is on."
1,terrible,"Dan Shaughnessy was a good writer a few years back, but has become a bitter, bitter man. I couldn't get through 30 pages of this terrible book."
1,Stout's Story Not About the Curse,"Dan Shaughnessy made up the Curse of the Bambino in the late 1980s and all the ancillary myths (such as the overemphasis on the alleged angst of Red Sox fans has followed ever since). Glenn Stout's background research was more on the demonization of Harry Frazee and why he sold Ruth, not over the imaginary curse.That said, Shaughnessy is a talented writer, but given his previous milking of the Curse and some of his comments about this team (it was obvious he preferred another loss because it would be good for business)and the fans, that it was, perhaps, in bad taste for him to write this book at this time."
1,Wow,"This book was painfully incoherent at it's best. There are about 10 other books at the bookstore I bought this at (I bought them all, of course) and each was better than this. Out of the others I bought the Leigh Montville"
1,A Freakin' Parasite,"When I think of Dan Shaughnessy I think of a parasite. Leeching off the back of Red Sox nation for about two decades he is a disease that needs to be purged. The fact that Boston Globe employs him is a black mark against them and their ever declining credibility. Instead of buying this book you're better off cursing this ""man's"" name, reading a real newspaper, and giving your $20 to a homeless drunk on the street.The reason that people pile on to this overrated lump of dung of an ""author"" is because he writes about the Red Sox as if they personally owe him something. This man ruins lives and ruins the connection between the fans and the team and yet he still manages to churn out poorly written books in his free time. Maybe so many people wouldn't hate him so much if everything he wrote weren't about shock value and were instead about a love of the game. This man loves nothing except tearing people down and looking like an artifact of the 80's while doing it."
4,Probably the best of the post-2004 books,"Despite all the invective hurled at Shaughnessy in these reviews, his is probably the best of the post-2004 Red Sox books. Does he lay the ""curse"" stuff on a little thick? Absolutely. But he goes out of his way to make light of how the ""curse"" was blown way out of proportion over the years (thank you Fox!). And he does a decent job of keeping the ""curse"" nonsense in perspective.Shaughnessy can certainly be a cynical Red Sox fan, but frankly we all were until last October. Most of the motorheads trashing this book spend their time listening to or calling into sports radio programs to berate Terry Francona for wearing a sweater too often.The book is a light portrayal of the 2004 season. There's some fun inside information, some cynicism toward Pedro, Nomar and others, and finally victory. If you're looking for a good recap of the 2004 season, this is probably the best of the bunch. Just keep the ""curse"" in perspective."
2,"Damaged, not durable.","We use this as a penpal mailbox in my classroom. I teach middle school special education. It came damaged, but as the school year was starting, I didn't have the time or resources to return it. Know that it may show up damaged! Lots of dings and dents. The color is pleasant, and the shape and design are great... unfortunately, it feels like we could break the door off whenever we open/ close it."
2,"Nice Product, DOES NOT FIT FS100","Nice case, it would work will for the right size camera. However, I purchased it to hold my Canon FS100 camcorder: It does NOT.Case Dimensions: 2.5 x 4.5 x 1.25inFS100 Dimensions: 2.4 X 4.0 X 2.3inI would end up paying $20 in shipping by the time I return it- Far more than the case value.For those that are still searching for an FS100 case, try this one: Lowepro Lens Case 1"
2,meh,"I bought this bag for a 15.4'' laptop mbp, an extra battery, a spare HD, and some papers. Not very much stuff. So I was extremely disappointed that a $ 90 leather bag that supposedly was of good quality had one of the straps completely rip off the body of the bag, where the strap was stitched in the side.This bag was used for 7 months before the strap ripped under normal, daily usage. There was nothing done to shorten the life of a bag such as this one."
1,"Thankfully, this is not my first Amazon product","This case was not what it was described to be. I did expect some wear but this was really fit for the scrap heap.It was dirty, over-used and there were even cigarette(?) burns on the body. Yet it was advertised as being almost new. If this was my first order with Amazon there is no way I could have returned. Thankfully it was not."
3,nothing to special,"this is a really cute bracelet, and for the price you get what you pay for. Seems like it could break very easily. Overall all its an okay purchase"
4,Informative book!,"Browder's book is very informative. It is a very detailed guide of the origins of civilization as we know it. I am a student of religion and I have never found a book that goes farther into depth about the contributions of African people to this country. It's on my shelf, right next to my copy of ""Stolen Legacy"" by George James."
3,I really like most of his essays,"I really like most of his essays but I (a little ole undergrad student) found too many mistaken ""facts"" that he writes in the book and can be easily checked. For instance, he said Shakespeare helped re-write the King James version of the bible. He didn't. Or take the example that he says Madame CJ Walker invented the straightening comb. She didn't. Its just little things like that that jump out at the perfectionist in me. I know that he's not just anybody throwing opinions around because he gives great references for further reading after every essay. So I guess I can look past those little nuisances."
5,This bag fits my Canon Powershot S20 perfectly,"The interior of Lowepro D-Res 10 AW is made of soft fabric that forms a thick cushion to protect digital cameras. The exterior is strong and durable. The hidden jacket at the bottom of the bag could be pulled out to cover the bag for water-proof purpose. Its easy attachment to the belt does not require taking off of the belt in order to mount the bag on the waist. As of the size, it fits a Canon S20 perfectly with a side slot that holds up to 2 Li-ion batteries and a front pocket that holds one CF card. Bottom line: I feel safe to put my digital camera in this bag."
3,So-So Date,"Mingus chose to work here with Hampton Hawes, a pianist who you'll notice never did rise to greatness. It's a moderately interesting date but not a great one and does not stand with Mingus' best."
4,Nice try to cover the essentials of hinduism,"First eight chapters are very well written. Rest needs work.Some chapters and ideas contradict each other. Writer tries to justify everything prevalent in hindu society with an analogy, which does not match with religion sometimes."
5,Just right for my camera.,"This bag is perfect for the Nikon D40 for on-the-go shooting. It's not for all your gear, just the camera and a few extra memory cards -- you'll need a bigger bag if you want to carry all the inventory with you. It has an adjustable strap to loop over your sholder or you can hang it on your belt if you prefer, or simply carry it by the bag's handle. It's what you need when you want to travel light."
3,Fits Nikon D40 with 18-55 lens but not 55-200,"I purchased this bag based on the review which states it fits a Nikon D40 with either the 18-55 kit lens or the 55-200 zoom lens. This is certainly not true, as I would have to seriously squish the camera, remove the strap and force the zipper for the case to fit the camera with my 55-200 VR lens. If you are looking for a bag that will fit both, I would bump up to the TZ 1 rather than the mini. The quality of this bag is excellent as expected from Lowepro, but unfortunately, now I'll have to purchase a second bag for when I want to use my zoom lens."
1,Unabashed Apologia For the Postmodern Literary Bureaucracy,"This is not good literary exegesis, it is an unabashed apologia for a literary bureaucracy, another pamphlet of the endless ""literary production"" under the pseudo-Marxist homology of poststructuralism. It ends up merely as a political struggle to save Kafka for purposes of cultural and intellectual identity.This book purports to get at ""the real Kafka,"" by stripping the man and his work of all transcendent pretensions assigned him by critics of the old school, by making him a model for the new uniformed postmodernist-socialist man. In ""Kafka: Toward a Minor Literature,"" Deleuze and Guatarri have done the same things they accuse the old Kafkologists of doing, in effect stripping Kafka of his old Kafkalogical baggage only to create a new Kafkology, one that focuses more on a weird interpretive biography of the man as celebrity than it does by trying to understand his works in their modernist setting."
5,"Fantastic, stylish natural planter","Love this! It took me forever to find a simple, vintage-looking, hanging planter. Coconut skin is nice and thick, great midcentury aesthetic, and effectively holds about 15 pounds of plant and soil from a ceiling hook in my apartment."
5,Good Gravy!!!!!,This is one of the best games I have ever played. I cant put it down!!! Buy this game today!!!
1,Horrible,"This game stunk, it destroyed my computer and im not joking!b It destroyed my brand new <Asin: B00006LU7C> not only that i called maxis for a replacement computer and it has been a month and they still havent called me back. Now i lost my 1,000+ computer and cant do anything.I REALLY RATED IT= 0STARS!COMMON DO YOU WANT TO LOOSE YOUR BRAND NEW COMPUTER!"
2,thousandth time: got no replay,Has been out for several years but this simulation has nice graphics. The problem is that it doesn't play fun for long.I've played Simcity 2000 and had more fun with it. Simcity 3000U doesn't have catchy music and the funny newspaper was replaced by a near-meaningless ticker tape. Etcetera. Has a scenario editor but custom scenarios play the same.
3,eh,This game is ok I got it when it came out. It was fun when I played it then it got broring and I stoped plying it its ture its ture. overall this game is a good game i liked it.
2,Sim City 3000,SORRY....... Sim City 2000 is more user/player friendly. Graphicsare good to ok. SIMCITY 4k Deluxe blows away SC3K. To be honest....I STILL PLAY SIM CITY 2K BECAUSE IT'S PLAYER FRIENDLY.
5,A beautiful book,"This is a beautiful book. I read it over 15 years ago and the images and dialogue are still with me. For example, when I remember Kristin's husband saying to her ""So it is finally over between us,"" and Kristin's agonized response, ""Over? Why would it be over? There is still much between us that can still be put to ruin,"" I still get teary-eyed. And when Kristin's first betrothed (for some reason I can't remember the names of the men) says to her husband ""I am less forgiving than you. I cannot forgive those who I have harmed,"" I'm still awed by the depth of the author's understanding for the complexities of human feeling. Though I have an undergraduate degree in literature, I read mostly genre fiction (sci fi, fantasy, historical). To me the perfect novel is beautifully written, insightful, and thought-provoking while still managing to be entertaining. This book is it."
1,mediocre,"I got this for a friend who wanted it. I guess she liked it, but I thought it was poor quality."
4,"Quick, interesting read","Eye for an Eye has an immature young man making rather a mess of his first entree into adult opportunities. The book is a jaunty, interesting run to a conclusion--a reminder that immature behavior by a young adult can have unforeseen consequences. Many of the devices of Trollope's comic novels are here, but they subserve a plot which resolves in a decidedly non-comic fashion. A light read, an interesting commentary, and a social frankness that does not seem at all old fashioned. Trollope was not always an ardent critic of his own social order, but he understood the problems, as this book shows in a non-preachy way."
5,ITS OK,"THIS TAPE WAS OK BUT NOT AS GOOD AS SOME OF HER OTHER STUFF, I WOULD LISTEN TO IT AGAIN BECAUSE I LIKE PRETTY MUCH ALL OF HER STUFF."
4,I found this book and saved $100.00,"This book is a classic. If you Google ""Finders Fee"", you will get a lot of hits promoting a course promising to teach you to be a finder. While the course itself has many positive recommendations and I have no doubt has valuable information, this is the book the internet course is based upon. While the internet course has an audio version, I like to read and refer back and save money!"
3,A strained performance by the talented Louis Smith,"As admirer of some other Louis Smith recordings (Blue Lights with Kenny Burrell, Newport with Horace Silver and Here Comes Louis Smith) I was a bit disappointed by this Connoisseur cd series-production. The musicians seem to feel in a hurry, very tense, and -feeling that probably themselves- trying to make the best of it by playing louder and over-active, what makes the whole only worse.Sonny Clark seems the only one to hold control over the music and himself. This is one of his better recordings, not unimportant because he is a rather unstable personality.Art Taylor, often playing a bit stressy, looses himself now and then completely, with negative effect on the other musicians, etc.A pity because of the very few recordings Louis Smith made in his best years (1957 and 1958)."
1,"Knife great, no problems, but the picture is wrong","Don't get me wrong, I have used a Gerber multi-tool daily for over 8 years, and have never had a problem with it. In fact, I own three different Gerbers, one full sized, (for everyday wear,) one mini (I can sneak it into formal clothes,) and another mini, which is permanantly attached to my backpack.I gave this particular model a single star, because I purchased several for friends, and the picture above is NOT the tool you receive. The one that is shipped has a single blade on one side, and a file on the other side. There is no saw, as shown above, which might be an important feature for some people."
5,Nice tool,"I have resisted getting a multitool for a long time, but finally got this one. It looks to be a very high quality tool, and the best thing about it is that it has USA stamped on it."
1,I can't believe this book exists,"This book's writing is that of a child trying to immitate another child. The book is made up of a collection of short stories that he forceably merged into one confused book.This is the worst book I've ever read in any category. I would rather read books about the drying effects of the sun on cow manure.About the plot. There was something about something, I think. At least, that's what the author wants us to think. The main character was dispicable. The woman he was chasing after was not worth it. Where the title comes from is absurd. Actually, the author thinks it clever to use a small cliched line in the story to title his book. Come to think about it, the book is cliche.To conclude, buy this book if you like to hammer nails into your or your children's eyes (because that kind of person would be the only one who would get amusement from such a book)."
1,Extremely boring,"All this is, is facts written on a chalkboard, starting with adding by 1. 1+1, then 2+1, 3+1 and so on. Then they add by 2's, then 3's, etc. If you have a video camera and a board or flash cards, you could do this yourself and save the money because it's not worth the effort to purchase."
5,"This CD is ""BEYOND A 5 STAR RATING""","I discovered this CD in the library about 2 years ago and have been searching for it ever since, until now. Rebecca has a fabulous voice. A few songs are in English and most are African dialect, which I prefer. I am a musician, singer/songwriter and appreciate each song. This CD moves me to joyous tears every time I play it. The 3 tracks I have chosen for our wedding are #5 - Buyani, #8 - Umoya Wam and #9 - Ngegazi Lemvana. While it is a gospel CD it can be embraced by all folks no matter their religious forte, age, gender, etc. I would love to attend in person one and plenty more of her concerts. BRING HER HERE TO MAPLE RIDGE, BC, CANADA AND I GUARENTEE SHE AND HER ENSEMBLE WILL SELL EVERY TICKET, BAR NONE! It has become and shall stay as one of my top 3 favourites of all time. I dance in my kitchen, blast it while driving in my car, and with great joy imagine sharing it with our wedding guests."
5,more fun than watching a yuppie's tie in a fan belt,"After years of trying to hide my youthful attachement to bad horror movies, hot rods, and tiki madness I was able to come out of the closet after seeing Cult of the Psychic Fetus at the Bank in NYC.Truely one of the great monuments of American culture."
4,Gift for a native Chicagoan,"I bought this book for my mother, who has been away from Chicago for many years. She loved the book. Many photos reminded her of her youth, and she was able to see the old church where she and my dad were married. I would recommend it for anyone who lived in Chicago long ago, or for a current resident who is curious about what the city used to look like. I would have given it 5 stars if it had a little more text."
2,Not The Tool For Presenters,I bought this hoping to use it when I gave presentations. I thought I could use the pen as a clicker to advance my Power Point slides but both the pen and mouse have to be on the tablet for them to work. Holding the tablet the entire time I speak is too awkard so I returned the product and will purchase a different product instead.
1,Huh? What do you guys hear?,"This is an absolute piece of crap. I swear to you Im not trolling. I couldnt find one song I liked on the album. The lyrics are just too darned corny: "" you broke the wings of a weary vagabond, I'm stranded on the island of your love"", I got preached to on "" A New Fix for 76"" ( in broadway style no less), and about war in the inanely titled Carnal Question. Ridiculous. I hope the great players were able to live down being credited on the album."
5,A Total Electronic Symphony,"This artist, for writing in the 70's, appears to be way ahead of his time. With music appropos to genres both pop and classical I found this to be a refreshing accomplishment of music."
4,All AROUND FUN,"This is my first digital camera, and I love it. The first time I picked it up, I knew it was a winner. Mass storage, easy to use, and it doubles as an external superstor disk drive. I love the burst mode for shooting sports action. The 10 sec video mode works great also. The menus are easy to acces and use, and the style of the camera makes it easy to hold and control. The ability to connect right to my tv and view my photos, makes for a fun time and instant enjoyment. Before I knew it I had taken over 180 photos, and never even came close to filling up the provided disk. The quality is great,and the LCD makes for great viewing. The only down side is the 3x zoom, not quit enough zoom, but it does work well. Other than that -- I love it."
3,Standard,"This is a standard and useful reference for anyone doing soils work, archaeology or similar allied work in the earth sciences. It is not easy reading, but then, it IS a manual."
2,It's an ok game,"Dont get me wrong this game has nice grapics,and ok music. But the game is slow and the controls are a pain, most of the game is just not what one would expect. Retro 80's looking people basicly running around and getting lost. Its not an Rpg game like Prince of Persia, Fable, Morrowind, or Baldurs Gate. Which I took it to be by reading the back of the game and the reviews here at Amazon. It is not like Maigc the gathering eather. So Im not sure what it is. I just know that if your an major Rpg gamer you will most likely not like this game."
5,brenda really pleases!,"Brenda Russell Is a delightful artist. Her music is well writtenand it has so much longevity. I have been a true fan for many years. This is one cd that I always keep close. There are manysongs here that touch my heart. Songs like in the thick of itget here and way back when, thank you Brenda for your sweet sexysound.The fellas should really like this cd. Jayelpricebeltsville,md."
4,Great movie,"This movie pretty much had it all. Don't expect some Godfrey Ho film. This one is for real martial arts fans. I put this movie right up there with Prodigal Son, of course not as good, I think that if the fight scenes were longer and gave me a little more sense of realism it would have definitely gotten 5 stars.And the release from video asai is perfectlky widescreened and the picture isd FULLY remastered. English dub and UNCUT. This is really the one and only video asai release that I can highly recommned."
4,Powerful but with a design flaw,"I like the mantis overall; it's lightweight; pretty powerful, starts easily but the on/off switch is too close to the accelerator handle so if the mantis jumps (and it will) it can cause your hand to hit the cut off and shut the thing down. I understand why they put it there because of an emergency situation but man, when I first got it I was accidentally cutting it off like 5 times during while tilling my 30 x 30 raised bed!!!!"
5,Super Mantis,The Mantis tiller is a little giant. It does the work of it's larger brothers without the struggle. You don't have to be a brawny man to handle this tiller and it fits in a lot of small spaces that you have in your yard. If we didn't have this tiller the work would have to be done with a shovel and hoe which is back breaking work. One of the best purchases we have made.
5,Mantis Tiller Review,This is an excellent product and is actually my second one. First one lasted 15 years. Light weight but powerful. Also use it with the large hedge trimmer accessory. Very pleased.
3,Mantis Review,"A good product. Great for between garden rows and edges. Haven't used it too much yet, but know it will certainly save time and backache! Very bouncy and doesn't do very well in rocky gardens."
4,tiller,"The mantis tiller is great for raised beds and not too hard soil, i have raised beds and it works fine for me."
4,"Good Ring, But Be Aware of the Return Policy","Ring arrived on time and looked like it's picture. Just be aware of the return policy. Only 10 days to get a refund and a 35% restocking fee. Combined with FedEx costs to Canada, it's almost not worth sending back for an exchange or refund.Again, the ring arrived on time and as presented, so overall they do a good job. Would just like to see a more relaxed online return policy for a $70 ring."
1,Terrible,"The grammar in this book is absolutely terrible. The sentences are wordy and often pointless. Much of the information is common knowledge. Towards the end of the book, the author makes less and less sense. If I wasn't required to read this book, I never would have."
1,Where are the Macedonians?,This tired collection of essays managed to miss the entire flavor of the country and the question. The lack of perspective on the issues is obvious - there is not a single Macedonian contribution or perspective in the mix.
3,"lotta soul, little jazz","This is a compilation of short Jimmy McGriff blues/soul tracks. There's no information about other musicians, the liner notes are uninformative--if you like McGriff (and based on these tracks, he's non-essential), go for another album."
3,Almost pretty good,I wasn't much into Fab til I heard his last real CD Street Dreams which was superb in a way. This has still has some bi@tchin tracks on it.Not to point out that the titles are fudged up since breate is actullay track 13.
1,Throwback Homo Thug,"Another wannabe gangsta wanksta kat. Lets be realistic, Fab likes men. Look at the way he carries himself, He is the sugar side of the shredded wheat!!! I hate to disappoint you true blue fans but I know chicks that have met him and he tried to steal their make up kits. Fabolous listened to a bunch of ol skool albums where they really did dirt and tried to incorporate that in to his albums. Don't fall for his lies."
4,"Very good, revealing story of the man who became ""Scotty"".","I have always been a fan of James Doohan, and this book does an excellent job telling his story. His involvement in D-Day, the early acting jobs, his struggle with his father, and of course his involvement with Star Trek. Doohan is also very candid in his feelings (both good and bad) for his fellow Trek castmates, and on the ""new"" Star Trek. If you are a fan of Star Trek, pick this book up. You won't be disappointed."
4,not sure,"Not sure of the quality, since I gave this as a present, but I will ask the recipient. However, it did arrive promptly."
1,Terrible,I was quite surprised to see how small and how cheaply made these were. The set was a waste of money.
4,Complex Characters Captured with Brevity and Depth,"I have really enjoyed reading The Unfinshed Novel and Other Stories. Valerie Martin is adept at short story writing. In a very few pages, her characters are complex and complete and that is a real art.The book is six short stories about various artists and their lives which gives the book a cohesiveness.Her one short story that starts out the book, His Blue Period, captivated me with its brevity and depth.I thoroughly enjoyed the story, The Unfinished Novel, Max is blind sided by his girlfriend of twenty years ago suddenly reappearing in his life, but now instead of being lithe and beautiful, she is fat and unattractive. The day he left her twenty years ago comes flooding back and for awhile Rita is back in his life and she has written a novel.One warning about this book: Most of the stories involve lesbians and lesbian lifestyle."
1,Static,This headset has so much static it is unusable. Motorola support has not answered any of my emails. DO NOT BUY
1,Not what I expected!,"Based on the cover I thought I was getting a cartoon insted it was an old version. The other thing I do not like is Geore is only in one of the ""3"" on the dvd. I feel I got a raw deal, the cover is very misleading. It costs almost as much to return it so I guess I am stuck. Make sure you know what you are buying!"
2,Awkward and difficult to read,"I also had to buy this book because it was required for a course I was taking. This book is probably one of the worst text books I have ever read. Mostly, I found the author's style of writing awkward and difficult to read, hence making learning new concepts unecessarily effortful. The author seems to know what he is talking about, but has a poor way of explaining it. I would not recommend this book."
4,A Necessary Evil,"It would seem that Maggie O'Dell has two separate serial killers on her hands. One in New England kills young women, then removes their heads and takes the torso for his trophy. The other attacks Catholic priests who have been implicated in abuse cases. Is there any baffling way that the two could be connected? As she follows the trail, things only become more confusing, and more dangerous.**** This fascinating thriller will keep your attention from beginning to end. Though at times it might seem confusing as two apparently separate killers terrorize the country, the way they are connected is a stroke of genius on the author's part. Ms. Kava has become famous for leaving readers with an startling end, and she does still, but don't skip ahead to see what it is; you won't get it unless you read the whole thing. ****Amanda Killgore"
3,Comments on a Necessary Evil,"I purchased this book, A Necessary Evil by Alex Kava, with a sense of excitement as Alex Kava is one of my favorite authors....she never lets me down.However, in this book, I found the characters underdeveloped and scattered. It was hard to follow if you laid the book down for any length of time.The mood of the book was depressed and the book tended to drag a bit.Having said that, I would like to also say that I was the one expecting so much from the book and I may have projected somewhat and that is entirely my fault.I would urge anyone thinking of reading this book to try it regardless of my thoughts and by all means, read everything ever written by Alex Kava as her books are a true pleasure to read and enjoy."
2,synchronism,"synchronism of pictures and audio is sometimes really bad!! so it is too expensive, in my opinion.and what about clapton? he's on the cover-photo but but not in the video."
4,Great Stories but Questionable Recipes,"Some of the recipes didn't sound too good- but many of them are very good. My husband has had a ball trying to make many of them. The stories are funny, yet most of them bring home their point very well. I appreciated that this was not in your face Christian writing, but rather gentle reminders that we all need to take care of ourselves spiritually."
4,Satisfied Customer,This book helped me recognize my own jerkinesses and masochism. It had several tests and behaviour inventories which helped me see what jerkiness actually is. It is a real help as one strives for maturity.
1,The right edition should be posted,"The book that is purchased should be the one listed. I purchased this book and the seller stated she will be sending me the 2nd edition.An old edition is not bad , but there has been some changes"
1,This is not DVD Audio,"This disk is not real DVD Audio format. This is just regular DVD with music and pictures.Also, delivery was extremely bad! I've got 2 of 3 disks ordered, after 1 month!!!!"
2,It frustrated me,Ok this look game looked good when I first started it. The graphics were nice and I was doing allright with the puzzles. But I am hearing impaired and I could not finish the game beacuse a vital puzzle involved matching sounds. Needless to say I was disappointed and frustrated. I wish the makers of these games would give some sort of an indication on the package just to warn people like me. I work hard for my money and I spent it on a game that ended up in a drawer because I was unable to finish it. It wasnt a bad game if I had been able to hear correctly I would have finished it and enjoyed it.
4,I'm Hooked,"After having the game for about a week, I had written that I found the graphics awesome but the frustration level was too high...I've changed my tune. I agree with ""Char"" that it is definitely a consideration for those of us in waiting for Exile. It is not a shoot-em up but a cerebral exercise for those who are up to it. I ordered the Solutions Guide for a couple of the rough spots but don't find I have to refer to it very often. Come on, Fellow Gamers - stretch your mind a bit."
3,Be Prepared for the Weird,"When you begin this game, be prepared for the weirdness to begin as well. Be prepared for...things. Strange things. This game leads you around intriguing (sometimes infuriating) puzzles, beautiful scenery and ambiance, disconcerting imagery, creepy characters (GAH! the goddess' head is on the freaking ceiling!), and a misleading plot. There is also nakedness in this game (especially in the ending). The plot leaves the player feeling confused. However, the difficulty of certain puzzles was great fun to attempt, and the graphics (bar the loop graphics on the people) were enjoyable. I will probably never play this game again, but it was an interesting experience to finish this game. I recommend playing it with other people, skittish people, to make the experience all the more fun."
4,Beyond Atlantis,"I loved the music in this game. As far as the game play goes you actually learn a little cultural history while at the same time having fun. The beaurocratic minitar is rather amusing in his lackluster attitude towards visitors to Hell. However, I found the constant motion of some of the charactors while speaking to be anoying."
2,Great graphics - but will make you CRAZY!,"This game provides a real experience for a PC gamer - the graphics are terrific, and the whole ""mystique"" of the theme intices you to try it. But shortly afterwards, the frustration that sets in will make you sorry you did! I am not into PC games as much as some of the other reviewers are, but I am an intelligent person that enjoys a challenge, and a diversion once in awhile. I picked the WRONG game for that! This game required my finding a ""cheat site"" on the web so I could continue on with it, and I have needed to refer to it throughout my attempts at it. And the ""cheat"" info was not always enough to get me past an obstacle. There are very few clues for you to know what you're even supposed to be looking for, ridiculous blocks along the way, and slow movements that only add to the frustration level. Find another game!"
3,Scenery isn't enough.,"At first glance Beyond Atlantis' Myst-like 3d worlds look promising, but it simply isn't enough to make up for the acting, which made me wince, and boring, random puzzles with no underlying logic."
2,Beyond Atlantis,"This game has very good graphics but the excitement is not so high. This game is very theoretic and leaves you thinking. Personally, I wouldn't recommend this game just because it wasn't as fun as I thought it would be. But hey, that's just me! It's a good game if you're in to serious philosphies and wonders about life."
2,Big Firms Only,"I've been devouring legal marketing books as I prepare to open a two-person practice. I skimmed through this book and found it to be distinctly unhelpful. You wouldn't know it from the book's self-description, but it is primarily aimed at marketing large law firms (100+ lawyers) with huge marketing budgets. If you are a small firm or solo practitioner, look elsewhere. Even in terms of its big-firm focus, the book is far too broad and generic to provide much useful advice and guidance."
2,DISAPPOINTED,"I am a long time LL fan and was very excited about this album. Liked Control Myself when it first came out, a little tired of it now due to over exposure (radio, MTV, BET, etc.). Really feeling Freeze w/ Lyfe Jennings right now. But that's it. Those are the only two songs on the CD that grabbed me. Not worth the $14 I paid."
2,"Ergh, what happened?","Yeah, I am old school. But I work in the music industry, I do hip hop, I get it...but I don't get this. Why does everyone have this selling for $9.99? You have to wonder if they are tyring for #1 then its just gonna disappear. I luv LL, but you kept waiting for that one track to jump up n grab you, and it never happens. Too many slow songs, you cant even pick out a song to say ""at least this is decent"". It will sell with the ladies because of his sexiness (undeniable) and the marketing of the lp. But, out of pure curiousity if you got $10 to spend, check it out on your own...."
3,LL,"This CD was ok. There weren't many songs on this one that were released as singles. The ones that were, were good. But I still love LL."
3,UNCLE L,"I MUST ADMIT I AM A FAN OF UNCLE L BUT,THIS ALBUM SHOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED THE LL COOL J DUETS.FREEZE,ITS LL& SANTANA,PRESERVE THE SEXY& WE GONNA MAKE ARE UNDENIABLY HOT JOINTS...DON'T GET IT TWISTED,THE ALBUM IS NOT WACK BUT,I THINK ITS TOO MUCH OF HIS R&B RAPS...HIS PREVIOUS ALBUMS WERE BETTER.HE'S USING THE SAME FORMULA THAT JA RULE TRIED TO USE EXCEPT THAT HE DOESN'T SING..NEVERTHELESS,THERE IS NO DENYING THE FACT THAT HE'S ONE OF THE G.O.A.Ts"
1,Hang it up LL,"I'm sorry but LL is just not the same as he was years ago. Remember ""I'm Bad""? Well don't expect anything like that on here. LL has simply lost his touch and I think it's time for him to retire before he makes himself into a bigger joke than he already is right now. Please LL just retire because this is just one of the worst albums of the year. This is not hip hop, it is generic, stale, commercial pop music at it's worst. This is dreadful. Big thumbs down. LL either retire or step your game up or loose more fans!"
5,As good as it gets,"Want a killer CD that defies description? I first had this as a tape in college and made my parents (musicians, not easily impressed) sit in my Cutlass Supreme while I blared this for all it was worth. Even my dad, record producer, writer of some major hits, musician, couldn't say anything bad about it...all he could say, was ""wow"". It has classics (I just want to stop), but it also has some of the best up tempo jazz you might ever hear. The real magic of this CD is the rythym section, which defies description. Whether we're talking the percussion on ""The River Must Flow"" or various bass solos, this is truly a masterpiece."
4,Education Readings,"Enjoy the breadth and depth of entries. There is a good variety, particularly class, race, and gender. Would like to see more on the adolescent. I now see this in the follow-up work. Thanks for this excellent complilation."
4,"Great memory holder, wish it had a hard case though","This is a great little card holder, especially when you consider that some memory cards do not come with great plastic protectors.The interior has 1 large stretch pocket on the interior right side, and 2 smaller mesh pockets on the left side - great for holding a couple of memory cards of any type. The overall construction feels strong, but I wish they'd make this in a hard 'shell' like case even if they do claim the exterior is made for ""all-weather"" situations. Nevertheless, this a must-have to protect your memory cards and the images on them."
5,Beautiful story about a Vietnamese boy & an American soldier,"I first read The Man in the Box when I was in sixth grade, and read it again many times while in elementary school. It is a very tender story about a Vietnamese boy who comes to the rescue of an abused Green Beret who is being tortured in a box just large enough to hold him. The young boy's father was killed in a similar manner by the Viet Cong, and he was compelled by his father's spirit to help the American, though it would cost him everything he had. Very heartbreaking story of compassion and friendship between a young boy and the tortured man who asks him if he would like to go to America and become his son. Reading this book brought me face to face with the horror of Vietnam for the first time."
2,Disappointing,"How anyone could rate this game above two stars is beyond me. I was thoroughly disenchanted with this game. Although the graphics and the cinematic seens were impressive, the fun factor was VERY disappointing. Don't expect for this to be a high action, role-playing game with lots of shooting, explosions, and weapons. The actual gameplay is limited with too many cinematic scenes. Player interaction with the game is severely low. Don't expect to use a gamepad with this game: the player is limited to the use of the mouse without the keyboard. This game has left a very negative impression on me toward the makers of this game: Dreamcatcher Interactive. I'll think twice before purchasing another game from this company."
3,"Beautiful band, but not enough holes.","This is a beautiful band, color and stitching. I bought this for my wife's watch, it is gorgeous, nice leather and stitching. The band is the same length as the old band, but has 3 fewer holes, and thus, even on the last hole it is to loose on my wife's wrist. I though of ""making"" a new hole but it's right where the stitching is. A waste of a nice band."
1,Extremely disappointed,I made an unfortunate selection in purchasing this storybook before a similar review (H. Hudson Aug 14) was posted. Had I waited I could have benefited from that review. Instead I must post a similar review. The most disappointing thing about this storybook is the CD does not let the child know when to turn the page. We also expected to hear familiar voices for Pooh and the gang rather than just a full narration. At this price there are much better selections if you are going to be turning the pages yourself.
3,A historicist's views of the Bible,"A historicist's look at the prophecies of the Bible. Considered by most, one of the most intelligent people that ever walked the earth, some of his views are hard to find fault with. Newton's mastery of history is much to be admired. This book will definitely give you some food for thought."
4,A must for students of the Bible,"I purchased this book in anticipation of a class I will be taking on the book of Daniel. I find it interesting that a noted historical figure and respected scientist wrote more in his life about the Bible than he did about science. This fact is obvious when you pick up his book on The Prophecies of Daniel. It is, as expected, well written and full of scriptural references. Newton sites several scriptures as well as some writings from the Maccabees which helps him lay out the History of the book of prophecy in an organized and well thought out manner.Where Shadows Scream"
2,Not a good game,My son tried it and he didn't like it because it was so hard to control the movement.
3,Good and bad,"This game is the best and worst of the eyetoy. When it works well it is an awesome game. When it doesn't respond, which is way too often, then it sucks. I've tried lots of light, little light, freaking spotlights even.The problem is that when the camera craps out it totally removes all the enjoyment of the game. Say for example you are racing and all of the sudden the eyetoy thinks you are moving to the left (but you are standing up straight). So you try to compensate and end up crashing into a wall. You then pause the game and try to recalibrate. It works ok for a while and then it thinks you are ducking or you hand is your face or something. By this point you have lost the race and are cursing furiously. Repeat as necessary.It totally pulls you out of the game and often I pulled the game out of my PS2 when it happens."
4,Long Forgotten Supergroup,"When this group hit the underground stations in the late 1960's, I was very much impressed with their refreshing, artistic and progressive sounds. Gary Wright and his keyboard excellence stands alone on cuts like ""Evil Woman."" This band deserves more recognition from the rock world. Hopefully, other CD's from their library will be released in the near future."
3,The King,"This is not your average ""reading book"", but a series of personal revelations made by Anne Ree Colton in regards to The Higher Self - the King, as she calls it. These are presented as series of one or two line stanzas that are designed to ""awaken"" your own Higher Self within and the understanding of the nature of the Higher Self by the reading, and perhaps re-reading, of these passages. I do not suggest this as a ""beginniners"" book on such a matter - but rather as an esoteric teaching tool for the serious seeker on the Path of Enlightenment, for it is within the subtleties of the Mind and Spirit that these stanzas will effect their greatest influence."
2,Grossly deficient sound quality,"Disappointing. The sound quality is often GROSSLY deficient. On track 1, for example, it sounds like the drummer was using a wet cardboard box. On other tracks, the recording of the backing band fluctuates wildly in volume. Sound quality for the lead musicians themselves is generally fine, but enjoyment is spoilt by these other problems. In my opinion, this CD is for music historians only."
4,Cute plush but not quite as pictured,"I bought this as a special Christmas gift for my daughter. It arrived in the mail today, and I am a little disappointed with it. It is not as cute as the picture here. It is still cute (and probably will be an okay plush for her), but from the picture, I was expecting something cuter. It is not completely different from the picture, but it is a lighter pink and does not stay in the position it is in the picture. I guess a limper body will better for cuddling. The plush is very soft, and I think that my daughter will enjoy it. I just wish there were more pictures of the product so that I could have gotten a better idea of what I was buying. It is growing on me quite a bit the more I look at it and handle it, but I was quite disappointed when it first arrived. I would recommend it as a cute plush pig... it's just not exactly as pictured."
1,Stupid girls+Stupid story=Stupid movie!!,"New york minute is a completely awful movie with a bad story line.If the Olsen twins should have know what they were doing,they would have never act like a bunch of jerks.Imagine the cast from Beastmaster,Andromeda,Mutant X and Earth final conflict come together to destroy the film by seeing Captain Dylan Hunt burning the set on fire,Dar the Beastmaster slashing the cameras and the ropes,The Talons shooting down the cars and the Mutant X team to kill the movie once and for all!!!"
2,"A very slow ""Minute""","As the mother of three girls (5, 7, 9) I see ALL of these girl movies. Most are shallow but fun. This one was unusually long and boring. I have nothing against the Olsen twins - more power to them for creating their empire. But the plot was just too slow - especially the first third. ""Mean Girls"" was a bit racier but TONS better."
5,It opened my eyes to the deception of Satan against God. How devious Satan is in misinterpreting what God is asking of us.,Review - It opened my eyes to the deception of Satan in inticing us to mistrust our God. All that is good in us is from the light of God.
2,Poor print job - hardly readable - printing so faded,"I am getting ready to return this book. It was printed and hastily put together. The pages were printed together 8 1/2 x 11 xerox paper and bound. It is cumbersome and the printing is so light it is impossible to read. Now, I have to order this book from another vendor. I can't believe it passed inspection and was actually mailed out."
2,Just not so great,"I thought this sounded great from the description, but the illustrations are a little too 1970s for me. I don't really enjoy reading it out loud. My toddler is not super into it. I think there are other good books out there that also give a sense of the importance of diversity."
1,Not that great!,"I was very disappointed when I received a copy of this book. It is ""choppy"" to read and the grammar is atrocious! The pictures are drab and my daughter didn't really care for the book. I suggest that you take a look at the book before you buy it."
5,"Beautiful story, beautiful pictures","I first came across this book in a children's literature class in college. I immediately fell in love with it. Now that I've had the opportunity to share this with an almost-2 year old, it's even more special. The illustrations are so beautiful, quite different from the mainstream baby book illustration styles. I love the multicultural aspect of it, both the depiction of children of different ethnicities and the beautiful use of language. Unlike some of the other reviewers here, I think it's a benefit to introduce children to all sorts of uses of language. The fact that it's not ""grammatically correct"" (according to whose standards anyway?) is a benefit rather than a deterrent to me. There are all kinds of ways to use the english language and none of them is wrong."
2,For Readers Only,Disappointed that my preschooler will not be able to use this for years. Without cues to turn the page she cannot read it independently.
2,"Disney Lion King, Little Mermaid, Toy Story , Aladdin, 4-n-1 book","The seller did not specify in the title that the CD is not included in the book. Additionally, the book was listed under the subject: Books with CD's!!!!!!!"
2,came without CD,"This product came without the CD and the pages were torn. Some of the pages were taped back together. It's condition was described as good. I would call it's condition poor, at best. When I contacted the shipper they did offer to refund me with shipping both ways. They told me it was sold without the CD. However, nowhere in the description did it say no CD was included. I wouldn't buy another thing from them."
4,Great Fun Album!,"I loved the show, and thought these girls were really talented a hard workers! I really like this CD! It has great dance tracks, and number 14, ""Stay with me"" will stay in your head all day. Great CD worth the money!"
5,The Classic Rock Fan Is Impressed,WOW unbelievable. These guys truly have talent and they show it. I was a skeptic at first but it has kinda grown on me. A very well done album and a great first attempt. They got some great catchy songs and great songs that you can dance to.One suggestion though love songs that is what they need now a good love ballad or two would completely win me over for good. Bands that can pull off ballads truly stand the test of time.Truly an impressive album I know if I like it you probably will too. It truly is good stuff. So I suggest you buy this album today.
3,still not sure...,"I am not sure what to really think about this album. There are some extremely catchy tunes (i.e. show stopper, ooh ahh, hold me down...), but the album as a whole has a very strange feel to it. It seems to move along much too quickly and the songs seem to be very short and much too quickly paced. They have this odd mix of running together and being too quick to really get into a song. I do like it, but I think that it is a bit sloppy. I really expected more from some of these top notch producers that they enlisted to make this album. seems a bit like a high school project... all in all, it is what it is, and it has some nice beats, fun to listen to."
3,It's Okay...,This CD does not have a whole lot to offer. It has some ok R&B. Nothing dynamic. The songs don't change the face of music as we know it but they are worthy of a spin. The singing is not up to reality show search standards. Nobody in this group has a very good voice. I mean they all sing ok but they are not fantastic singers just average. This CD mostly is slow jamming instead of party jams. If you loved Rihanna's song We Ride then you might love this CD. I would hope that this groups next CD pulls out all the stops.
5,Sassy & Funky,P.Diddy made the right choice in choosing the band members for this band.Going from obscurity their voices have developed tremendously. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.Paula Jordan (UK)
2,Danity Kane,Just to be nice im going to give it 2 stars but the only song i really liked off the album was Show Stopper.
2,Lukewarm,"I was a fan of the show and really liked all the girls that made the group. I think they are all very talented, beautiful, and are ready to work hard to make it in this business. With that said, I was rather disappointed with the CD.. Some of the tracks don't sound very ""clean"", they sound like drafts still rather than being polished. There are a couple of good tracks on there but I'm surprised that with the kind of talent that went into creating this record that it doesn't sound better. I don't think that's the girls' fault though but rather production."
5,Tastes Like Sweet Tarts and Really Works!,"Since white carbs are like crack to me, and this society is inundated with them, I go on and off strict no-white-carb-ing. The theanine in these tablets helps to relax the craving that a carbaholic has during the first 2-4 days. When I crave, I am so happy to realize that I have crave-relax. I enjoy the Sweet Tart taste, since I don't like very sweet food. And it DOES allow me to forego eating.Thinking it would be cheaper, I tried buying l-theanine capsules, but found that with all my other supplements, I simply didn't want to swallow another capsule.I'm going to start a fast this week, so I'm kicking it off with a first day of allowing myself coffee in the morning and crave-relax during the day. Second day half the coffee and should require less crave-relax. We'll see how this goes, since I haven't been successful in a fast for health since my carb addiction took over."
3,My daughter said it was okay,I had to get this for my daughter's college class and she said the class was interesting and that the book was okay.
3,college material,"actually, I ordered a newer version of this book, yet, I didn't recieve it, now I am not complaining because the book served my needs which were for classroom purposes(study, notes, etc.) therefore, I must say the book was Ideal for those reasons alone. I also want to state that the priices were exceptional and would like to commend amazon for having such reasonable prices that are afforable. I always tell my friends to shop online with amazon to purchase thier books."
4,Kids liked,"Good DVD....kids enjoyed watching the old Mario shows, cartoons and realty show with Captain Lou. Lots of shows and well liked"
2,YIKES! This show is awful!,"I wasn't expecting a 1989 cartoon to protray Mario's world perfectly, BUT EVERYTHING IS WRONG! It opens with awful live-action that does not even have anything to do with Mario. Sure, the actors are dressed to look like Mario but they hardly do anything that relates to him besides eating pizza and doing ""plumbing"". The animated parts are a little better, but not by much. They are mostly just parodies like ""Koop-zilla"" or ""Pasta Wars"". The enemies are colored wrong and look awful. After a parody it switches back to the live action part to end it. It's an awful and basic try to make a game star a tv star. Get The Adventures of Sonic The Hedgehog, that one is really funny and wacky."
1,Went flat in less than 48 hours,Do not buy this tube! I bought these to replace two flats i had on my road bike (28c) and one of them went flat in less than 24 hours. I know it can't be the terrain because i live in a city and i purposely road very carefully the one time i rode it. As soon as i woke up the next morning the tire was flat. What the? So i took out the tube and was checking for leaks by inflating it- lo and behold there was a leak the size of a pen dot right under the valve.. i checked my rim and tire- nothing. Just a crappy tube. Don't buy this.
4,Loved story hated spelling errors in kindle edition,"I really liked this book as I've liked all by Steve Martini. However, this kindle version had a LOT of spelling errors! I've bought MANY kindle edition books and have found errors once in a while, but this book had full of errors!!!!"
5,Typos,"A great read if you can get past the absence of proof reading. Most th`s are turned into m`s so ""that"" turns into ""mat"" and ""there"" into ""mere"". Makes for hard reading at first."
3,"Not one of Mr. Martini's best, but still worth a read.","This is the first of the Paul Madriani series and thankfully the other books that follow are much better than this one. It give a good basic knowledge of the main character, but I found the story weak and slow and unbelievable. Characters evolve in a series and fortunately so does the writing. Stick with the series as it does get better. Mr. Martini is right up there with the thriller authors and does not let you down."
2,Am I having a bad hair day or is this novel boring?,"What's wrong with me? I love Eudora Welty's short stories. But this novel was exasperating. The story opens at a family reunion in backwoods Mississippi, where the author ""overhears"" endless conversations about nothing carried on by the Renfros and their kin. For hours, they debate whether the family antihero,, Jack Renfro, will appear at the reunion (after several years in the penitentiary).For 60 pages, I waded through trivial dialogue as family members eagerly awaited Jack's appearance. I gather from other reviewers' comments that the family bad boy did show up eventually, but by that time I'd left the party. I'd closed the book and drifted off to sleep.If you want plot action, this is not the book for you. I'd suggest you pick up Carson McCullers, Flannery O'Connor or even William Faulkner."
1,Adorable,"This book has a certain sweetness to it. So sweet that diabetics can only read it when fastened to an insulin pump. It is laden with vegetable metaphors, comparing things to flowers, trees, leaves. Involving an adorable southern family, an adorable county in rural Mississippi and little towns so adorable that they make your saliva curdle, after one hundred pages you get this great urge to commit adorable mayhem. No racism, no clans, after 150 pages, nary an African American.I notice that you can buy it used for a penny. Purchase it only if you intend to recycle it to Kimberly Clark."
5,Great Reading!,If you are new to Reiki or an old pro this magazine is a great read! It has many ideas and techniques for using your Reiki energy and covers every subject imaginable on Reiki.Don't miss the opportunity to improve your Reiki knowledge tenfold by subscribing to this treasure!
1,Descriptive Notation...,I've been reading through the games of Tarrasch and commentaries about his games. I find I have an affinity and grasp of his concepts (which is not true of a large swath of high level historical players.) I was very anxious to get this book and ripped the box open with high anticipation.Imagine my disappointment when they hadn't even bothered to translate this into algebraic notation! I cut my teeth on descriptive notation but it has been abandoned for good reason. I find it easy to sit in a coffee shop and read through a game in algebraic notation but not one in descriptive.If you like or are at least comfortable with a book in descriptive notation then I really don't have any valuable comments as I sent the book back unread.
5,Best Hook Yet,"I have purchased many Fast Track parts at Lowes. This is an excellent system since it lets you move hooks, shelves and baskets around as your needs change. This is far more convenient than fastening hooks to studs although if prefered these Multi-Purpose hooks can be thus fastened. I needed a couple of Multi-Purpose hooks in addition to the ones I bought at Lowes. When looking at the Amazon display I noticed that the construction was different from the ones at Lowes so I decided to give them a shot. The Amazon Multi-Purpose hooks are superior to Lowes in that they have a latch that slides under the rail to hold the hooks securely. To remove the hooks requires an easy pull on a conveniently located release tab. These are really nice hooks and if I need more I will be back to Amazon."
1,Item different than pictured.,"Item received was different than pictured. I'm not sure if Rubbermaid changed their design, but the picture posted on Amazon should reflect the actual item being sold."
1,Okay,These hooks are a rip off. They're designd to be used via the Rubbermaid Fast Track. It's cheaper to bug hooks at Home Depot and Lowers and just bolt them to the studs.
5,Excellent,Fantastic book. Couldn't put it down. You won't be disappointed. Loved it and want to read more books by this author
4,Good read.,"I enjoyed this book. The characters were well developed and the story was both believable and interesting. From the first page to the last, you are on a roller coaster ride involving the poor chioce of a 16 year old girl and the consequences she will face throughout her live."
2,Pretty unbelievable,"I could not buy into an intelligent girl agreeing to help in this kidnapping plan. Yes, she fell head over heals for this guy, but the plan did not even make sense!"
5,Remembering the cartoons of my youth,I remember watching this cartoon when I was young. I have always loved Godzilla and so I took this cartoon. As an adult I purchased this DVD (I have the previous 2 as well) knowing that it wasn't the best made cartoon but to relive some of the older cartoons that I did enjoy. If you have a young child that is into Godzilla and monsters then they will probably like this cartoon.
4,OK,Replacement heads are the Same as in the store. Saved a dollar so it was worth waiting 5 days for.
4,"Great great movie, but does not play on Blu-Ray","I cannot improve on earlier comments about the film - it has been one of my all-time favorites since I first saw it in the 80s. I have not watch the completed DVD yet, so I cannot comment about the missing scene (but I agree it would be a real shame if it is not in there).Had to deduct a star, because this ""all region"" DVD would not play on my Blu-Ray player. I tried on 2 different units. Luckly, I also have an all-region standard DVD player, and it plays on that unit."
5,Sometimes Madness Is Wisdom: Zelda and Scott Fitzgerald,"If you are at all interested in the Fitzgeralds, this book is a precious gem. It shows far more of Zelda's creativity and outrageousness and less of her madness than Nancy Milford's book (which Scottie Fitzgerald was very upset by). It captures the Jazz Age and shows how Scott really assisted in Zelda's madness by insisting her life was his material and that she couldn't develop a professional reputation of her own as a writer. Nearly every schizophrenic episode Zelda had was preceded by Scott's blocking her attempts at self-expression. It still presents a sympathetic portrait of Scott, however. It's the best book on the two of them that I've ever read, and really brings the period to life. It makes you want to cry afterward for the potential that was wasted with both of them."
4,"Great book, easy to use, especially for herbal beginners.","This book is very informative and has a lot of great remedies that are easy to make. The list of where to buy herbs is extremely helpful, plus it gives ideas about where else to look. It is a good book for newcomers to herbal remedies in that it gives an overview of what types of herbs are helpful in preventative and curative measures. Overall, a great resource to have at home."
3,Interesting thesis,"I found this book to be an interesting read. I'm not sure I buy into their thesis that the gamer generation is different, due to growing up with electronic games, but they did make a good case for it.The book was well written and engaging. As a gamer myself, it was interesting to read how they feel gaming changes how players view the world. As an older gamer, however, I supposedly have not experienced the full impact as much as those to who video games were a ubiquitous part of childhood."
2,Not very good,I found most of the recipes in the book hard to prepare... definitely takes more than 15 minutes from start to finish! They aren't that good even when you do it right. I totally regret my purchase of this book.
5,A Memorable Story,"This is an enchanting tale of a young Indian woman's search for her roots in old Bangladesh. The search itself is like following the roots of a tree, a fantastical tree that is the husband of her old aunt. Each bit of knowledge takes you deeper into the narrator's past, India's past, the ambivalence of modern Indians whose ancestors had to find identity under the British Raj. How much is fact or fiction in the telling of this history doesn't matter. The story, myth, mystique take us deep into the soul of India, as deep as we can go not having experienced it ourselves.This book is second in a trilogy (first was ""Desirable Daughters). I look forward to experiencing the third."
3,Barely OK,Not a great Cole novel. The book introduces a offshoot of the main theme early on but because it isn't clearly explained at that point I had no idea of exactly what the author's point was. It dragged along and none of the characters caught my interest. A poor lovestruck LAPD detective with a junior high crush on Elvis is just pitiful. I put this book down several months ago then read several other books then a Christmas present book and finally got around to finishing this baby. I think that says the book is no page turner. I've been reading Elvis Cole stories for a long time and this is way below average.
3,Not One of His Best,"I have long been a fan of Robert Crais, and have followed Elvis Cole's evolution from the start. While this is a good read, there were too many mystery/thriller genre stock ploys and plot twists that made this an ordinary effort. If you are fan, by all means read it. If this is your first Robert Crais, this is not the place to start."
2,Reader sounds bored to death,And succeeded in boring me as well. I have always enjoyed Elvis Cole so am not sure it is the storyline or the awful dead-tone narration but this is the only time I've left Elvis to discover the ending without me.
4,Great quality!,The quality of this product is awesome. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the fanny pack sits very high. If you have a shorter torso this might be very uncomfortable. It would carry the contents of a medium size purse easily!
3,An interesting story but I would have liked a little more analysis,This is a decent urban history book that covers the reasons for the movement of people from the east to the west coast. It follows the baseball team the dodgers as they decide to get out of New York and head to Los Angeles. It understands the significance of the automobile and the attraction in the post world war 2 era to move towards the west coast. The widespread use of the airplane makes it possible for teams to head out that far so that they can travel. This is a light read that is very well done and is good for either fans of sports or urban history.
4,"Next volume, please!","Here you'll find: Van Richten's Guide to Fiends, Van Richten's Guide to the Vistani and Van Richten's Guide to Witches . If you are looking for rare monsters you sould look in this accessory."
3,Not that impressed,"The characters are interesting and the story line is unique. The graphics are very good but every time you go into another area it's has to load.The areas are small and you need to move between them often so it feels like the game is constantly loading. Because of this I'm giving it a 3 stars.It's a fun game but not as good as I had expected it to be. I'd recommend renting it first. It's not worth 50 dollars and I don't think that it really has any a replay value, at least not for me."
2,Huge Dissapointment,"I got this game because Tim Schafer worked on two of my favorite games of all time Grim Fandango and Full Throttle. However, It didn't take long for me to get incredibly bored of this game which reminds me of some souped up version of super mario brothers. It lacks creativity and imagination and is nothing like the lucasarts adventure games I fell in love with as a kid. If you're an early lucas arts fan, save you money and don't buy this game!"
2,lousy customer service (great book),the book arrived a month after the order was placedit seems it was sourced from Italy and covered with a USbook jacket. it has three different publishers names. it is a great dictionary but I shall never order anything from this supplier again.
1,Not as described!,"The description says that it is 18"" and it is not!! It is really, REALLY small! I am very disappointed. It won't even hold a camera! I wish I could return it before the occasion I needed it for. Very upset. Not as pictured!! In the picture it shows the case holding a drill."
1,Nonsense,"Isn't it accepted by now that ""Atlantis"" was on Thera, which blew up in the mid-2d millenium BC, becoming the Santorini archipeligo? Isn't this well noted event, attested to in several ancient sources, which likely brought low the Myceneaen civilization a more plausible answer to Plato's fantastical description of a lost civilization? Instead people rush out to read silly pseudo history written by a guy who titles himself ""Prof."" What kind of nonsense is that: ""Prof.""? Not Doctor, or even Professor? No letters after the name is generally a sign that we're dealing with an amateur historian, which isn't so bad, if you think that Troy was located by an amature, Shakespeare's identity plausibly argued by an amature, and Homer's Ithaca arguably located by an amature; however, Southeast Asia as the location of a Helladic civilization? Come on, people. Nonsense. Wake up and read real history."
3,Uneven book with lots of good but some bad,"I really enjoyed most of the chapters of this book. The author gives lots of tidbits of behind the scenes, the beginning of DisneyWorld and the different lands. What I didn't enjoy was that it skipped about so much. The chapter on whether or not Disney's Magic Kingdom is politically correct was written in a biased tone and didn't match the other chapters upbeat tone. Also, although petty, it does seem the author rushed to print. Tom Cruise DID NOT dance with Snow White at the Academy Awards - that was Rob Lowe and Michael Eisner graduated from Denison not Dennison. The editors must have been asleep. These are very easy facts to check. Otherwise I enjoyed the information - it was a fun companion book to the typical guide book"
5,GREAT,I'v been useing this tooth paste for a hole year and before I used it I had yellow teeth now there white and I love them and tnis tooth paste.
1,disappointing,"The picture of this looks great, but in person the chips are microscopic. In fact, they are almost invisible. It's a cute charm for a bracelet, but that's about all. As jewelry, or the perception of jewelry, forget it."
2,Not Bright Enough to Illuminate the Road or Obstacles,"As a bicycle enthusiast who has owned CatEye products for nearly 20 years, I eagerly attached this light to by mountain bike and went for a spin around the streets and trails of Manhattan. Unfortunately, I was rather disappointed with its overall usability.The light uses three intense bluish-white LEDs that are very easy to see from a distance when facing the light. However, these are not powerful enough to illuminate a trail, road, or pothole. In short, the light is excellent tool to acknowledge your position to oncoming motorists and other cyclists. The flashing mode is especially easy to see. Yet, the light is simply not powerful enough to illuminate the ground before you. Hence, it is basically useless if you are trying to avoid potholes on roads or vehicle barriers on poorly lit bicycle trails.ProsGood ConstructionMultifunctionWaterproofConsInsufficient brightnessUses AAA instead of AA"
1,Terrible!,"I saw this movie as a little kid and I recently just saw it again. I was offended t the core of my being. As a kid, I had nightmares! I recommend this tape for shotgun practise only!"
4,nothing to fear but bad music?,"out of the three oingo boingo cd's i own, the way i'd rate them, nothing to fear is number two. only a lad is number three and dead man's party is number one. it's a good album, but i just like the songs on dead man's better."
3,Really cute but a little bit to small.,"This pencil bag is super cute, but after a while it just got too small for me. I am a 8th grade student and it didn't really work out for me so i use it as a portable make up bag instead. It really cute and really fun but not big enough for school."
3,Games & Lovers,First I must say that either I didn't read the movie description completely before I bought it or I must have been asleep. This is not actually a movie but a play. It was a little hard for me to follow and the story line was too involved. The actors were very good but I just didn't like the play.
3,Quality is good .. Bigger than expected,This is nice pouch for storing long lens camera but it is too big. If you need a snug fit bag for your camera this is note the one . It does have huge space for spare battery and memory cards.
4,Roomy,I have a D40 and this bag is perfect for it and few extra items...worth the price...the texture of the bag is soft and not that hard core material.
4,Perfect fit for my Nikon D50 and 18-200 VR,"This is a great little bag. My Nikon fits lens down in it, and there is just enough room around the edges and top to squeeze my tamrac strap in as well. For the most part I don't attach any straps to the bag and just carry it by the handle. Since it's inexpensive, I also purchased the chest strap, which holds the bag snug against your chest but makes it very easy to retrieve the camera without removing the strap. Although I've test-fitted the chest strap, I haven't taken it on a hike yet so I don't know if I'll like it or not.I held back a star, probably unfairly, because the fabric of the bag seems a bit thin and unexceptional. I don't think this is a performance issue at all - I just would have preferred something thicker and more tactile, like ballistic nylon."
5,excellant protection for a good camera,"i finally broke down late last year and purchased the DSLR camera i have wanted for years, but couldn't carry it with me on my motorcyle until i found this camera bag. it has plenty of depth to protect the lense, and room at the top for a good quality camera strap. it fits easily in my motorcycle saddle-bags, so i can carry it on road trips when i plan one. good product, well worth the price."
2,IS PAUL DEAD???,"This book is very well researched and written, but I believe the writer missed a golden opportunity to put this rumor to death once and for all. Instead of examining the physiological differences, if any, between the pre-1966 Paul and the post-1966 Paul, the author simply rehashes old ""clues."" Although interesting, the ""clues"" do not shed any new light on this subject. Is Paul dead or isn't he? The question still persists, and the author of this book never addresses that issue. It would appear from his writing that the author simply accepts the fact that this was a ""hoax."" However, not everyone shares this view and this book does little to sway the reader one way or the other. If you're a die hard Beatles fan, don't bother reading this book, but if you're a non-Beatle person looking for information on this piece of Rock-N-Roll history, then I think you will find this book very interesting!"
5,Essential to a Beatles library,"I've been a fan of this book ever since it first appeared about 10 years ago in hardcover. It's easily the best thing written about one of the oddest chapters in not only Beatle history but the annals of pop culture. Reeve interviews nearly all of the principal figures in the hoax, provides abundant illustrations, and corrals all the ""clues"" and ""theories"" and any number of fascinating sidebar stories into a flowing narrative. The death rumor makes a great story and Reeve gives it the treatment it deserves."
5,This suggests what few will consider.,"Itzkoff's solutions will draw up fire from the masses. One of his suggestions is basically that unintelligent people be discouraged from breeding, and intelligent people have most of the country's children. This is wise, and objections to it stem from ungifted humans' selfish desire to keep their bloodlines alive. The only other solution is genetic engineering, but nobody seems to want that either.Itzkoff's other suggestions, such as school vouchers, are perhaps more politically correct. Overall, America needs more intelligent people, a goal worthy of acheivement, even if brings the ""bigot"" label to us."
2,Very few script examples in the book and the CD ROM work!!,"The reader can really get a basic understanding of JavaScripting however, very few of the examples in the book nor the CD ROM are functional. Being a JavaScript novice I did not appreciate the hours I spent correcting technical mistakes in the book and the CD that would prohibit most script examples from working. I look forward to a free copy of the second revision. With working scripts I would have given the book a 9"
1,Not what you thank,"If you're looking for a awesome Japanese Horror flick. Keep looking cause, this ain't it. Its more like a bad Japanese Porno, than a Horror Movie. From the begining to end, it has scene after scene of cheesy sex scenes. And the very few times you see the ""Slit Mouthed Women"" shes not remotely close to being scary. I havent scene the american version (Craved). But it can't be worse than this. If you're looking for a good japanese horror. Checkout JuOne (The Grudge) or Ringu (The Ring). And if Japanese Porn is what you're looking for, there are much better sources all over the place for free."
4,"Enjoyed the journey, but not the destination","Written in the voice of a famous novelist's wife, this recounts the life of a woman who buries her talents under mounds of housewifely duties. Finally, unable to bear the brunt of a secret (revealed at the end of the book), she decided to leave her husband at the apex of his recognition.Her flat narrative tinged with a bitter wit, bespeaks a sharp and observant mind. She recalls the struggle in the early women's lib days, of bright women to be heard and taken seriously. She also brings across the exhaustion of raising and tending to a family, and the toll it takes on one's creative spirit.The end came too abruptly for me. I felt that the narrative could have been fleshed out a bit more. Or was the author trying to convey the ""last straw"" mindset of her protagonist?"
5,The Wife,I found this book to be extremely well-written with great descriptives... The author takes you on a tale of a marriage and it's demise with a couple of little shockers at the end... After a while I had a hard time putting this book down. This was a very good book and was refreshingly different from other books I have read that may explore similar issues...
4,The hand you're dealt,"After reading the opening paragraphs of this book, I wondered why a friend had recommended it. It was about a woman who came of age in the 50s, and clearly it wouldn't resonate with one of the hippy/baby boomer persuasion. But I read on with faith in my friend and was rewarded. Yes it is ""dated"" in some ways (although published recently---2003) since it predates ""the pill"" and the choice it gave women to plan their childrearing. But there are plenty of biological and political realities here that still ring true.The book is humorous, though on the cynical side. But the ""wife's"" decision at the end of the book transcends cynicism. She chose the relationship, and she bought into the compromises it entailed. She recognized early on that her being recognized as a writer was probably not likely, given the sexual politics of the time. So she plays the dutiful wife to the end."
2,Not an enjoyable read.,I felt compelled to read this book straight through after a friend recommended it to me on several occasions. I can't see what all the praise is for. The story was sad and depressing and the writing was so . . . boring. The characters are so full of themselves - annoying people I would avoid like the plague at a party. The last chapter or two has an interesting twist and a few phrases worthy of reading twice - but much too late to redeem this novel.
3,Interesting Look,"A very fine and intriguing documentary from Errol Morris about the life and work of physicist/celebrity Stephen Hawking, who revolutionized the way we think about the universe in his monumental book of the same name. The film is really divided into two stories, the life of Hawking as he struggles to overcome his paralysis, and the brilliant work he achieved in spite of his physical limitations. One gets the impression that had Hawking never became ill, he wouldn't have been as compelled to carry out the kind rigorous intellectual work that he of course did carry out, and (he himself notes that he was quite bored with life prior to his paralysis). Morris does a fine job with the material; the first half hour of the film suffers from a dry PBS feel, but the aesthetic and intellectual intensity takes off from there, the film never digresses into a mere sob story. Morris nearly always keeps the material more intellectually intriguing than it is uplifting and sentimental."
1,Beck Arney timing cover gasket set 038-0236,"I just purchased this part from Amazon.com. This is the wrong part for my car. With a little more on-line research, this part is for a 1996-2001 Toyota Camry , not the 1995."
3,"Nice, but not quite what I had hoped.","I am a big fan of Kathleen Daelemans and have all her cookbooks. They are amazing. I was very excited to find a video, and I was hoping for a lot of techniques for making healthy, low fat foods. It was nice, but I would have liked something with more philosophy, instead of a few meal ideas. Overall, I think I'll stick to her books."
4,"Excellent, but the first one was better","That about says it all, Broken Sword Shadow of the Templars was better, but this one is pretty darn good too. The graphics might even be a little better."
2,Dog door flap,I am happy with the shipment and quality of the flap. It was just like the one I need to replace except it is 1/8 inch shorter. I guess the door was shortened a little since I purchased mine in 1988. I will still install the flap when the weather warms up and next winter will add weather stripping to the bottom of the flap frame and hope the jury rig will work.
1,Warning: does not fit older PetSafe doors,"Back in 2004, when remodeling my house, I've bought a PetSafe door (actually, two of them) and got my contractor to install proper wall and door passages. I've replaced the doors once and now they are due for another replacement. On PetSafe Web site, I found that this type and size is called ""Ultimate Extra-Large"". To my surprise, nobody is carrying this type anymore. The current models are usually narrower and taller. What am I supposed to do, remodel the house again? Changing the shape of stucco cutoff is quite expensive!I will never buy PetSafe product again if they are not able to provide proper long-term support. I don't mind if they change colors or materials, but they should at least support previous door sizes, because walls and doors have much longer life span than pet doors."
4,Replacement Flap,Have had this door for over nine years. This is only the second replacement flap in all that time.Would give it five stars if only it would fit tighter around the edge. Need a good seal with 115 degree weather and AC running. Had to build up one side with weather strip to get a good seal.
5,Great Replacement Flap,"I got this flap delivered in no time, and installation was a breeze, after viewing the installation video on PetSafe's web page. It's nice to have a new flap that blocks the cold air from escaping in the summer, and from blowing in in the winter. Great product."
2,Poor design leads to frequent replacement,"I'm now on my 3rd one of these flaps for a sliding glass door pet panel. Considering how expensive the initial door purchase was, it really stings to pay this high price for these replacement flaps. The flap that came with the door was torn out of the frame inside of a year. The replacement flap seemed to be of slightly higher quality, but it's lasted less than 2 years and now is mostly split where it is hung from the aluminum frame and there are large gaps on either side of the flap. Flies come in through these open spaces. I have no choice but to purchase these replacement flaps but it really bothers me every time I do."
1,not a replacement for Johnson,"Even thought Petsafe is advertised as having taken over Johnson pet doors, their replacement flaps do no fit the Johnson doors. In the past I was able to purchase the Johnson replacement flap, I am now afraid that I will have to purchase a whole new dog door and ""re-carpenter"" the opening."
5,Best product EVER!!!,"This product is well made beyond belief. I just replaced my first one that I bought 5 years ago....and my two large dogs go in and out, in and out and in and....excellent purchase!!"
5,Lowepro Micro Trekker 100 Camera Bag,"I really love this bag with its backpack straps and available space. I was able to fit my Nikon D70s DSLR with a small zoom len, an extra longer zoom lens and my SB-600 flash. It has a small form factor which was important to me, and the black color looks great. There are plenty of little pocket spaces for extra batteries and memory cards. If you need a small backpack camera bag, you should seriously consider this product. Go for it..."
3,Possible installation issues,Anyone purchasing these should take note of the measurements and check before buying. These are a little smaller than the standard plates in your home and any defects under the existing cover will be noticable!
5,its a wall plate,"It covers holes in my wall, it is white. There's really only so much you can say about a wall plate."
4,Nice Supplemental Book,"This was the first Japanese learning book I got for myself. It's in a workbook-fashion, with lots of pictures and stickers that you can put on things around the house. That's very nice and all but it didn't teach me how to learn Japanese. I started instead with the Berlitz Learn in 30 Days program and am doing better. I also supplement with another learning workbook, videos, podcasts and whatever else I can find.Using this book as a supplement is fun, but don't count on it to learn a lot of Japanese."
1,Avoid Romanji at all costs,Japanese Step by Step : An Innovative Approach to Speaking and Reading Japanese is a great starting book.Learning Japanese in Romanji will just hinder you at later stages.
3,Good for introducing the Japanese language,"I think this book is a great introduction to the Japanese language and especially for introducing it to kids because it is a fun format for learning a language. But if you want to be a serious student of the Japanese language, I suggest you pass this book up and invest it in something more in depth...and one book is definitely not enough. Japanese is a very difficult and complex language and it takes many years of constant study to start to really get a grip on it...this book is barely a drop in the bucket."
2,Not Much Use,"If you don't know the rules, are new to football, etc., this book might have value.The book is about 150 pages. The first 50 pages is dross, unless you are an absolute newbie. If you know the game at a basic level and want depth to help your flag team win some games, look elsewhere."
5,Mondo Boingo,This is the absolute PEAK of Oingo Boingo. Danny Elfman uses every nuance in his voice to make his music penetrate you. A definite must for ANY collector.
4,Good shoe.,This is the 2nd pair of these that I've bought and I'm still impressed. Comfortable and durable.
5,Hillbilly Music,Old time country boogie and the beginnings of country rock music are both still good as well as being nostalgic. The performers were at the top of their game and without the improved technology of today were still able to provide excellent sound and enthusiasm. Very listenable.
1,Disappointed,"Thought it would be similar to Gaither's ""Old Friends"" and ""Turn Your Radio On"", the two best videos ever made in the history of the world. This one, sadly, was a dud."
1,Brilliant Director's Early Effort an Appalling Mess,"Boxcar Bertha, director Martin Scorsese's second film, is an appalling mess. The acting is terrible, the editing sloppy, the story uninspired and dull, and the directing, dare I say it, is unsure and incompetent. Thank goodness Scorsese was able to learn from his mistakes and move on to the artistic brilliance he showed in his later work.The entire film really suffers from the Roger Corman production, who often gave his directors only 7 or 8 days to shoot a film, and the editing really needs the sure hand of his future editor Thelma Schoonmaker, who is one of the secrets behinds Scorsese's success as a director. I still think Scorsese is one of the most brilliant directors in the history of film, but sadly, with this dog of a film, he was saddled with a dull story, poor production, and stiff acting. Only recommended if you are a die-hard Scorsese fan and want to watch his entire body of work."
4,Take Your Gear Off Road,I have been using the Off Trail for a couple of years and have truly found it to be an essential piece of equipment for short hikes and extended travel. It doubles as an excellent padded case when put into a large pack without the need of traveling with an additional camera case. The only down side is that the lens cases on the side do not accomodate a large lens. The plus is that they make excellent weather proof film holders.
3,"OK, but could be better.","Its well made as you would expect from Lowepro, but not as rugged as I had hoped. I wouldn't feel happy using it in the bush or for hiking but for walkabout in the city it will do just fine. There is no room for a flash and another failing however is that the bag desperately needs a utility pouch, somewhere to put a few extras like cleaning cloths, spare batteries and the like. All in all it is uninspired and I imagine it will work its way to the back of my cupboard over time."
2,Olympic Bar Weighs 38 LBS,"So I'm working out with this set for a while, getting some personal bests. I go workout somewhere else and their bar feels heavier. I get home and weigh mine and to my disgust it is 38lbs rather than the expected 45... Pretty pathetic."
1,They never shipped it,"They never shipped my order, and then canceled it almost a week later. Thanks for wasting my time."
2,Can't recommend this product,"We have owned this flatware set for about five years. Unfortunately, a few pieces are now missing so I am looking for another set. I wish that I could just buy more of the Henckels Manor to add to what we have because I love the look and the feel of this flatware. However, I agree with others that the quality is poor; our set is now badly scratched and has water spots that cannot be removed (I was blaming my dishwasher until I read the reviews). I do not recommend this product, as much as I liked the set for the first few years."
3,Simple,"These are very simple, plain completely clear wine glasses. I thought they were going to be a little more fancy (looked like they had some silver/gray in the picture) but ,hey, they were $25 so not a bad deal for 4 glasses. They are of decent quality."
2,"Let's not go to Camelot, it is a silly place","Wakeman is one of the Great Egos that Walks in the world of rock. There are times when his reputation is well deserved; this is not really one of them. The peice on Merlin is one of the most senselessly silly works he ever put together; most of the rest range from fair to blase. If you are a Wakeman completist, or an odd Arthurian, I would reccomend it; otherwise, I would suggest you save your shekels for some of his better works."
1,Technical Overload!,"This was truly one of the most horrible books Tom Clancy has ever attempted. Who in the world could get past the technical jargon to enjoy the story? Was there a story? Is Tom Clancy writing for the general population of readers or only for the select few who can understand his technical journeys? I have suffered through three or four Clancy novels, and this is absolutely the last I will put myself through. This one was given to me by a coworker who could not get past the first 50 pages. We threw it in the trash. Don't waste your money and don't even waste your time on a trip to the library. This book is totally BOOOOOORING, even for the military action-minded. If I could have rated it zero stars, I would have!"
4,John Kelly/Clarke,"Even though Jack Ryan is the main character I read this book because of John Kelly. I had already read the book twice, but I wanted it stored in my Kindle. The book is filled with detail and there are multiple events taking place. One event leads to another event. It involves Japan against the USA and could lead to WWIII. This book has more suspense and intrigue than books by other authors I have read."
3,An improvement over the last few Jack Ryan novels,"I found this book to be more enjoyable than the last few Jack Ryan books I've read. The subject matter was not as disturbing as the last two novels, while the suspense and drama remained. This book didn't start off with a bang like most of the other Jack Ryan books have. It started more slowly, but continued to build piece by piece to a very dramatic and interesting conclusion.Like many other Jack Ryan books, this book could have used an editor. The entire Indian subplot seemed to be a waste, and served as a distraction. There were several other scenes and subplots that could have been omitted to make the book shorter. I don't mind reading longer books, but the payoff for these side items was minimal, so I think it would have been better if they were cut.This book was good enough that I am interested in continuing the series. If you've like other Jack Ryan books, you'll like this one. Otherwise, it's pretty average."
4,One thousand pages of 500 pages of material,"The Book, Debt of Honor, is a book concerning a ambitious Japanese politician who starts a war with the US. The US blame the Japanese of monopolizing the car markets in Japan, so the put an embargo on all Japanese goods until they make free trade. The Japanese, with their economy failing because of the US's embargo, goes to war by sneak attacking US ships during a war drill. To make matters worse, the US and Russia had just destroyed their last nuclear weapons when the Japanese announced their intentions of taking back of the Pacific island they lost during WWII and their new Nuclear weapons. The United States fights back, wins the support of the world as they score a number of sly and cunning victories. Even though I wrecked the first half of the book, you can read the other half yourself."
4,Debt of Honor,"I enjoyed the plot immensely! Every now and then the detail of ships, airplanes and missiles is too extensive, therefore heavy. It would still be a good book without so much arms description."
4,Suddenly too real,"Though there were some unbelievable parts throughout the book, as he has in most of his novels, who would have though that the end of the novel would come true, but only in another location. The previous book was just made into a movie. This climax was just made reality. But there is no Jack Ryan to make things right."
2,The Only Tom Clancy Novel I Did Not Like!,"Japan is one of my favorite country's to read about. Tom Clancy and his novels are some of my favorite to read. So Debt of Honor should have been the perfect book. Unfortunately it was not.Bottom line was the story was one of Clancy's most ridiculous. And way too much on the finacial stuff. Pages and pages of the Wall Street and economic stuff was just too much.The ending is certainly a shock, but again too far fetched. Too much on stocks and currency and not enough action. The whole idea of a Japan rising is old too and just a bit cheesy...maybe in 1985 it would have been more topical.I love Tom Clancy books. And this is the only one I did not like. Parts of this book are very boring and others are laughable. The ending sets a great new storyline while at the same time....COME ON!There are better novels about Japan and certainly better Clancy novels."
4,Wonderful,Great book. I wish Tom would write more war type books. He's the most creative writer I have read yet
4,Maybe his best,"Although clancy does way to much explaining in Debt of Honor, I found this one of the most entertaining of the lot. It isn't, however, real. I lived in Japan when reading this, and even though I can relate to a lot of this, it's a bit stereotypical. It's not a fault though, because the REAL world is much to boring to write a book about. A definate must have."
3,Too much missing,"There is just too much missing between this abridged tape and the book. Yes I know what abridged means, but in this tape there seems to be no connection or reasons for some of the action. It is a good thing i have read the book so I knew what was going on. I will keep reading Clancy but I have bought my last audio book of his."
5,Great Book,"This was an excellent novel. I had not read a TC book since Without Remorse, and this one blew me away! I'm glad I ordered Executive Orders to read next. He is a master!"
4,Tom Clancy foresaw this tradegy,"His plausable story has been real situation. I heard He already warned the weak defence system of US core area such as white house, pentagon and so on.... I express my deepest condolence to all victims."
2,Great book!,"Tom Clancy in my opinion, has great insight about the government and military. His books are very captivating and exciting."
1,Terrible,"I had to rate this product with a single star because there is not option for no stars.The package contains a single plastic rectangle with an adhesive backing. The intent is the user is supposed to clean the pda screen and stick the plastic shield to it. The instructions indicate that any bubbles can easily be pressed out using a credit card (there is a small cardboard card enclosed).Well - the protector installs under the screen frame tightly so any bubbles are permanent. It is very hard to get off as it has an adhesive background and the edges are not accessible. I had to use a Zacto knife and that damnaged an edge of the protector thereby defeating the purpose (and ruining the protector) - to protect and provide clarity.I do not recommend this product. It was too frustrating and frankly, way overpriced."
5,OMD,"I unintentionally received a cassette tape of this album years ago through a record club. I decided to keep it. After listening to it for the first time, I became an Ozark Mountain Daredevil junkie. I wore the cassette out. I immediately ordered two more cassettes. I was so happy to see that they are now available on CD. The songs are as enjoyable now as they were when I first heard them. It's timeless music that I will never grow old."
3,worked well for several months,"This worked very well at first. After 4 months or so, the sliding mechanism got difficult to operate. Now it's hard to switch between spray and stream, but it's still usable. We have really hard water in our area, so I expected that kind of problem. If you have soft water, it would probably work well for a long time."
5,wonderful device,"Makes life so much easier, definitely a must if you have a regular faucet. Now I don't need to use a cup to rinse off my sink."
4,The actuall Armageddon card for 2005.,Randy Orton vs. Undertaker (Hell in a Cell Match)Booker T vs. Chris Benoit (NO.4 best out of 7 series match)MNM VS The Mexicools (Tag-Team match)'World Tag Team Champions'The Big Show & KaneVS'WWE Tag Team Champions'Rey Mysterio & World Heavyweight Champion Batista(Undisputed tagteam title match)WWE Cruiserweight Champion Juventud VS Kid Kash(Cruiserweight title match)Thats the card ok guys. WWE just haven't been bothered to update it.
4,Good Bang for your Buck,This is a good starter bag for an on the go photographer. I used it to keep my camera safe and easily accessable. It was great on the ski slopes and I plan on taking it ever where I go. The price and size were the perfect fit for my wallet and hip.
2,lovely but not good quality,"I spent weeks looking at flatware sets and finally settled on Henckel's Opus after seeing a set at a store. The set at the store fit well in my hands and had some heft to it. The set I received from my Amazon order was very light, unbalanced, and cheap looking. I do not think it would withstand the frozen ice cream test. I returned it immediately.I will say that Amazon.com makes returns incredibly easy."
2,Shame on Amazon --repeated sale of a defective product,"This is my second DeLonghi oil-filled radiator. The first was superb -- it provided reliable, abundant heat for several years in a 500 square feet basement rec room (temperature outside ranges in the winter from 15 to 35 degrees). I disposed of it only because one of our house pets chewed up the wire. This reconditioned model almost works well -- at last. It did not work at all when I received it. The lights went on indicating electricity was flowing, but there was no heat, and the timer did not work. Happily another reviewer solved a similar problem by opening the cover and connecting two wires which were left unconnected. I also found two wires disconnected. After connecting them, I have been able to get heat (comparable to my former model), but the timer still does not operate (it runs electrically). Shame on Amazon for repeatedly selling a defective product and shame on DeLonghi for such sloppy factory reconditioning."
1,I was not please at all!,"All of the reviews I read I thought what a great deal. I purchased 12 batteries ofPowerex AA 2700mAh NiMH Rechargeable Batteries w/holder- 4 Batteries Per Packthese plus the charger and I was greatly disappointed in both. Did not get the the charge lenth or power out put. I read the booklet and under stood how this system works. I found that Harbor frieght has better batteries, and do last longer and cheaper. thank you for read of this."
1,"So, so","I bought this on a whim after owning ""Journey To The Center Of The Earth"".For me it wasn't all that great. I wished I never bought it."
2,Dated and dull beyond description.,"There is no questioning Rick Wakeman's technical skill or importance as a progressive rock instrumentalist. However, this is what you end up with when your technique is more important than your creativity: dull, rambling, dated, unmelodic organ runs and cheesy ""classical"" piano instrumentals. If you're still someone who thinks ""Fragile"" is the greatest album of all time, then this is for you. If you have any taste in music, avoid this at all costs."
2,"Fun for little kids, for a short while.","This is fun for a three-year-old for a very short while. There is really no racing involved, the two bikes are absolutely identical and have only one speed. This means that they never end up any farther from each other than where the began, so it's not like you can really race.Little kids will be amused by this for a short time, but once the novelty of a moving bike wears off there's nothing else to sustain the entertainment value of the toy."
2,One Speed/One Torque Setting,"This drill is good if you only want to drill holes. Not really useful for driving screws as there really isn't a ""torque"" setting. The site describes this as having 9 torque settings, but this is not true. It has one speed, and that's it. I really couldn't tell how long the battery will last before re-charging since I won't use this to drive screws. You are more likely to strip the screw head and better off using a manual screwdriver. I'm embarrassed to say I bought many of these to give away but now I wouldn't. Only because of the torque setting."
5,Super Gift for Under $10,"I bought 3 of these as gifts. Wish I would have bought one for myself. These are very nice tools for the money, and certainly do not reflect a $10 price tag. Great gift idea for friends who ""have everything"" and are hard to buy for. Everyone can use an extra cordless drill/screwdriver! No-frills packaging, but, ummmm, who really cares. Biggest ""con""? Not American made."
5,Best deal I have seen,"Dont let the low price fool you. This is a great deal. It is sturdy, well made and powerful. The rechargable battery it comes with is top notch. I really like it."
1,"couldn't finish it, and couldn't click less than 1 star","I have seen my fair share of b rate movies, but this has to be by far the worse movie I have ever seen. I am actually upset that I have spent 2.99 to rent this. It was almost as if the director just put up a camera and told the crew to wear whatever and do whatever you want, just make sure it's at least 1 1/2 hrs."
5,One of the best anime features ever!!!!,Golgo 13: The Professional is one of the greatest anime features i've ever seen. Golgo 13 is an omnilethal asassin who alway get's his man/woman. Great '80s synth lounge jazz scoring accentuates the gritty storytelling. fight sequences are fluid and plenty.
3,Get Your Golgo 13 Fix,"I loved the Golgo 13 Volumes 1 and 2 so I searched for more Golgo 13 products. When I discovered The Professional movie I became excited and ordered it immediately. When the product arrived, at a very reasonable and timely matter, I ripped it out of it's packaged and popped it in the DVD player. Well, it's nothing like Volumes 1 and 2. The quality isn't there and Golgo's voice is so much better in Volumes 1 and 2. I did enjoy some of the fight sequences and there's one part where Golgo is actually hurt. I never saw that happen in volumes 1 and 2. If you're a Golgo 13 fan then get it, but don't expect it to blow you away."
1,Mediocre,Was not real impressed with this one on the civil war. Not too well put together although the info in it is good.
5,A classic,Absolutely one of my favorite CDs. I only learned about PT about 4 years ago and have been catching up at a feverish pace. This CD blew me away!
4,Elvis Thru the Years,"I love having the early clips of Elvis with Milton Berle and Steve Allen. As a long time Elvis fan,I was grated by the inclusion of the baby photo - which is not Elvis! But that's just me, the rest of the presentation was wonderful. Milton Berle is one heck of a comedian, the army footage was just great. Watching the press corps en mass at every SINGLE moment of his induction. I only wish it had included Elvis receiving the Man of the Year award or some Madison Square Gardens footage. I'll always want more!"
2,Rust after 2 washes,"Knives rusted after two washes, forks after 3... going back to the store tomorrow. Using mild detergent, this is unacceptable."
5,The Tubes Remote Control,"This album was among my favorites back in the day. I actually had it on 8 track. Then Cassette, and cd. After I lost the cd years ago I had a hard time finding it at the stores. Now I found it,.. ripped it to MP3 and have it on my ipod. It still sounds great after all of these years and music genres later."
4,"Excelent remaster,but hold on to your vinyl copy","About 2 years ago I digitized my vinyl copy of this, cause the only thing availabe was a used copy for around 40 bucks. Then last year I noticed they reissued it. For some strange reason, they used the version of prime time, for the T.R.A.S.H. <tubes rarieties and smash hits> album. The original version was more of a duet, where this version is primarily sung by Re Styles.All in all this ablum never sounded better, the music seems to jump right out of the speakers."
3,A good but leftist history,A good history of Cuba but let's not forget the leftists leanings of the author.
1,Not it.,"This is the worst kettlebell work out DVD I have ever used.The first 25 minutes is nothing but Swing Variations and Push-Up Variations. At times I felt like Bob was making up the exercises as he went. The girl actually doing the work obviously had no idea what she was doing. There was very little rest/stretch time. There is no 'Reps' counter and Bob doesn't even give you a suggested Rep amount. He just says go and expects you to do as many as you can. There is very little isolation between muscle groups.I could go on, but overall I got the sense that Bob had no idea what he was talking about.Not worth it. If you want a high velocity work-out you are much better off forgetting about weights and buying Insanity.#dissatisfied real-customer."
5,This album ROCKS!!,"If you like a lot of the hard/punk rock German bands, you will love the Fixtures. The vocals are awesome. The lyrics have a lot to say and the music rocks!!! I highly recommend it."
3,Not sure if it was me or the product,I didn't realize this yarn had a glittery string in it-- probably my own fault for not looking closely enough when I ordered. Received it quickly though!
3,cute but be careful,"I bought this for my son who is obsessed with Cars and it's great... he really likes it. but I thought I was getting a Lightning McQueen and ended up getting a Doc. I was pretty upset but then I read the description carefully and it says that in there somewhere. I think they should be more upfront and let you choose what you are getting. Which is why I gave three stars, instead of five."
4,"Good advice, but I knew that...","I bought this book/cd because it was recommended by my daughter's pediatrician. I bought it in the cd format so my husband wouldn't have to read a book, God forbid. It really is geared more for first time parents and I'll tell you why....when I was a single mom with my first child, I had to develop a discipline method that worked yet didn't have me fighting battles all day long. My son loved baseball so starting at age 4 we made up the Strike One, Two, Three You're Out game. Which is the same concept as this book (I should have marketed my idea, huh?) So this material just refreshed my memory of the game and teaches my husband, who IS a first time parent how to get through it. It worked most of the time with my first child. Still does and he's 13! I began my search needing direction on how to begin discipline with my one year old and this program is just over her head, I still go through the motions though so that it becomes habit for me and learned for her."
5,A Beautiful World,A Secret Word is a beautifully written novel that is both heartbreaking and uplifting. Jennifer Paddock shows us a world where salvation and comfort come from unlikely places and unlikely people.
5,Growing Up is Hard to Do,"Jennifer Paddock has accurately captured the trials of growing up and trying to become an adult. Her prose moves quickly and rhythmically, making it easy to get caught up in the story of these three young girls who are bound together by a small Southern town in Arkansas. It reminded me of my own close friendships growing up. I recommend this book to twenty and thirty-somethings, but the older crowd will enjoy it as well. I look forward to more books from Ms. Paddock."
4,"I agree, why the SKJ","I agree with the reviewer on the fact that they stuck a sore thumb at the end of the album. I was on the train enjoying the disc and kinda came out of the happy nebulon to a track that had a lot more structure to it. Don't get me wrong, it's a very good track, but better suited on an album with a different theme. Also, I have to complain about the reissue on a different note. Call me petty, but I like to have liner notes when I buy albums for the pictures, and also just background information on the recording sessions. And since I keep my CDs in a CaseLogic, it didn't help that I had to create a makeshift album cover with my scanner to store it. Am I too picky?"
1,"Doesn't even deserve one star, but it won't accept the review without at least one","I enjoy a lot of British productions, but this isn't one of them. It's totally awful - I wouldn't recommend that anyone spend a penny or a minute on this piece of trash."
3,Very dramatic,"I read the novel ""Jude the Obscure"" before I got the movie. My favorite actor, Robert Powell, was in it as well, so I decided to get the movie. The acting is very good, and the movie is very dramatic- however, I was dissapointed with the cinematography. The story is about a man named Jude, a stonemason who wants to become a priest. He meets his long-lost cousin, Sue, and the two fall in love. It causes lots of controversy in their town, and they suffer a lot of hardships because of their position. If you're one who enjoys the drama of a movie and doesn't focus on technical points, then I think this is a movie for you."
5,A cappella great music and funny too!,If you like Gershwins Rhapsody in Blue You'll love this a cappella version of his masterpiece!
4,to listen several times,"I am 51, and I confess never listened to Cat Stevens carefully. This cd was a discovery of a very fine composer and interpreter with much more than half a dozen hits."
1,Difficult to follow and riddled with errors,"This book suffers from several major deficiencies. First, it is inherently difficult to follow. The format is designed in such a way that you have to constantly refer back and forth between pages to get all the information you need for an example or derivation. The other thing is the examples are not clear. You find yourself solving the example again because the method isn't clear. In this way, I find the book extremely frustrating. Even after the problems with the contents, the book has errors. Lots and lots of errors. Just look on the inside front cover. ""Principal Elastiac Equations""? I checked the dictionary, and I don't know what elastiac is. Or Ch. 12: ""Yield and Fructure Criteria""? Is that a new term for the fracture of fructose? Finding all the errors is kind of fun, so if you're into that, get this book. Otherwise, look elsewhere."
1,Riddled with typos,"The good: This is a comprehensive book. The bad: It has tons of mistakes. There are typos galore. The most egregious one occurs in the chapter entitled ""Yield and Fructure Criteria."" That's right, ""Fructure."" Pray tell, what exactly is ""Fructure""? That's what's printed in big letters. The proofreading is very, very, very sloppy. Maybe these mistakes are more a function of editing deadlines rather than with Popov himself, but that doesn't mean that this isn't a bad volume that you shouldn't waste your money on. I used this book as a text and was very disappointed. Save your money and buy Beer and Johnston or Craig instead. Or even Popov's earlier work, Mechanics of Materials, which I liked a lot. Engineering Mechanics of Solids is just horrible in its mistakes."
3,This book is OK,"The book is ok--it leaves out an important issue---atm's and credit cards--you may not be able to use them in Bulgaria. Also, the book says it is ok to drink the water in Bulgaria. I did drink the water --and then spent a day on Cipro. Becasue there are not a lot of books out there on Bulgaria--this one will do in a pinch."
3,cute toy,Bought this for my son after he played with it at a playdate at a friend's house. It is cute. He loves the sandwich which comes part and can be stuck back together with zelcro. It is on the expensive side for the quality you get.
5,picnic basket,"This is a fun, colorful toy with easy to pick up light pieces and it is easy to transport fromplace to place because it can be put into a diaper bag."
2,Great toy but missing items.,"My son loves his picnic basket, but it is missing items. We just now got it out to play with after his birthday. He received a lot of toys, so we've slowly brought out new ones to explore. Unfortunately, the sandwich is just bread. I believe it is supposed to be two pieces of bread with ingredients inside to velcro all together. I'm hoping the seller can send me the sandwich ingredients that are missing. Otherwise, it is a super cute and fun toy."
4,Y'all seem to be missing The Point.,"What seperates this movie from others of its genre is threefold:1. The Satanists see themselves as the *good* guys.2. They have good philosophical arguments for same (how many people does Satan kill in the Bible? God kills millions...)3. Erm. The ending. Can't tell you; spoiler.Trust me, though: the subtleties of the above make this movie, to me at least, completely unlike any other movie in this genre that I've seen, and I've seen my share.-Robin"
5,Out There...,And in a good way. One of my favorites from Bauhaus. The creative spark flashes often here. Ingenious.Timeless music.
4,Creatively warped!,"I wouldn't define BAUHAUS as a Gothic band, I like to refer to them as a very 'ARTSY' band, highly creative and not afraid to explore the unknown with great vocals, effects and interesting lyrics. Burning From the Inside captures thses very aspects of this band.This Cd reminds me of twisted spoken word put to music!"
4,Great for begginers like me,im very please with this introduction to electronics book is great for begginers of all ages .
4,Oh so visual...,I loved the visual aspect of this book. As someone who likes to see things and how they work (ie. a visual learner) this book was great.
4,Good content,"I am a novice and the content is very helpful.However, the print is extremely hard to read. It appears to be written by hand rather than in a computer font. This is not ideal for me."
3,Highland 44030 floor mats,"I like the color,thickness ,but not the fit. In your ad it stated it fits BMW Z3 . Not quiet !! It's a little bigger & I will have to trim the mat to fit better. So dont tell customer's the are universal fit for this model !!!!"
5,LOVE THIS BOOK,"Sylvia has just the right words to say to get ideas across. I have accomplished so much with her wisdom and word play though this book. Great for training the young or older horse. Great ideas for patterns to work with and things to 'feel for as a rider' in new movements. Great to use to help you advance faster as your taking lessons. Even purchased a training video through Sylvia's website that I adore also. But this book has really assisted me and got me able to internalize what I needed to do between working with my mare so I was ready to move forward in our training every ride. I get into reading this book and I loose hours. I was working with a very knowledgeable trainer but lacked in communication skills that I need from Sylvia, I just picked up the book and I was having 'AHA' moments every ride and my mare was doing so well."
2,Best dressage writer ever,"Sylvia Loch makes dressage intelligible! This is the second of her books I have purchased and they have helped me so much. They are clear, concise and instructive. The images she creates in the reader's mind are easily translated to time in the saddle. Definitely worth the purchase price and then some."
5,Captivating,"All of the previous reviews are right one. In my case, I spend many hours on the computer making a living and this CD helps me to focus on my work without distraction. I never get tired of listening to it."
4,Great for kids,I bought these for my kids to use. They liked the color and I liked that I'm not out a load of cash if they get stepped on or lost as kids sometimes do to things. The glasses look pretty neat and seem to be constructed fairly well but keep in mind you are not paying $100 for glasses so there's give and take. Overall a good value.
5,A Good Book,Sanguinet's Crown is a very funny novel. It is a joy to read. The quick wit that both Charity and Mitchell have lends a nice blend of humor to the book. You can not help but love the quick light plot. It is one of my favorite light romances of all time.
5,The Replacement Killer - Blu Ray,Hi folks! This film is having a good stuffs of non stop action and presented in 1080P with beautiful transfer and blowing sound. You will enjoy the evening with a bag of popocorn disappearing just like that as the action scenes. Yun fat is known to us and become famous in USA with this film and recently we saw him hin at Pirates at Worlds end. Folks you can try this one for your collection and never fails.
3,"Too much shooting, little fighting","This is a nice piece of action movies - no personal dramas or the like to bore you, just action. Correction - shooting.This is the thing missing - fighting. Suspense, excellent photography, moody scenes are all there. But, between the bullets I'd like to have seen some fighting. At least on a movie with a martial arts actor.Video and audio are five stars. Special rewards going for the use of the DD 5.1 capabilities. They explored its potential the whole movie, not only on flying bullets scenes. A sound experience.Extras are just a trailer, a supposed making-of/documentary which, actually, is none of it. There's full and widescreen options.I liked it a lot. But missed the fighting."
4,"Not much Substance, but alot of Style","Chow Yun Fat's U.S. debut movie couldn't have been a flashier, action packed rollercoaster ride. Chow and Sorvino are great! The story is pretty generic, and is mostly tailored to show Americans who have never seen Chow , just what he is capable of. Despite the thin script, action fans will love this film!!!"
4,Can't get enough!,Loved this movie. I have watched it serveral times and with each viewing I am impressed by the details in every shot. This seemingly simple film is like a very finely crafted painting with details that are only obvious after repeated looks. My only regret is that I could not find the widescreen version of this movie for VHS.
1,Probably one of the worst films I've ever seen,"I had such expectations for this movie with Chow Yun Fat in it and John Woo producing. Unfournately, it turned out to be very dumb and poorly acted. Rent earlier Chow-Woo movies like the Killer or Hard Boiled and you will be happier. Also, check out Woo's 3rd and best American film, Face/Off"
2,Stupid child-endargement plot,"I guess the viewer is expected to feel sympathy and relate to a situation where an assassin is so warmhearted that he decides not to go forward with his contract of killing a cop because he's playing basketball with his kid. I sometimes consider myself a bleeding heart liberal but this is just plain stupid. Had it been a case where he decides not to kill someone because they make good pancakes, I could have related.Shallow. Target audience: prisoners who need to feel that there's someone worse than them. ""I did this and that, but I'm not a child killer""."
3,Not bad.. but not great either,"In this, Chow plays a hitman... again. He's assigned to kill a kid, but can't bring himself to do it. Not a bad plot, but the thing I found let it down was that when the bad guys are killing cops and civilians, it's in graphic detail, but when Chow finally starts blowing away the bad guys it's all off screen. So you don't really get any satisfaction of the bad guys getting theirs. At least Chow made his Hollywood debut with this instead of the really disappointing Corruptor."
3,"Nothing special, but great fun.","It's obvious that Antoine Fuqua's previous experience includes music video--every shot in this film is beautiful, from the way Chow Yun-Fat's coat floats around him as he plugs away at the bad guys to how Mira Sorvino's hair falls around her face. Even the sprays of blood from wounded gunshot victims are gorgeous. That's one reason to see this film.Another is Chow Yun-Fat himself. The paper-thin plot and stale dialogue don't give him much to work with, but he makes the most of it--and he's a talented enough actor to raise this movie from mediocre to fairly good. Mira Sorvino is fun too, as a tough-talking forger who becomes a semi-willing sidekick.But if you're expecting something on the level of Chow's Hong Kong films, keep waiting. This ain't it."
4,Great action!,Good chemistry between Mira & Chow Yun Fat. They should have made the two assassins that go after Fat smarter. They looked tough but they sure didn't act that smart.
4,"Action packed with a focused storyline, a sensory wonder!","Having reviewed multiple Director's and DP reels at an agency in Beverly Hills, CA, believe me when I tell you that this flick is a true masterpiece! The storyline is simple and uncluttered, the music is hot, plus each and every visual sequence is pure artwork. Nirvana for those who know what to look for. When is the last time a movie moved you? Director, Antoine Fuqua is the man! THE ACTION JUST WON'T STOP !!"
5,Awsome,"Quick shipping, I got my shirt 4 days after I ordered it! It's good quality and very inexpensive"
4,good workout but a bit boring,I like the moves- but the DVD seems a bit out of date- could use some good background music- but overall it is a short workout with a lot of punch. I am not sorry I got it- I rotate this with other DVDs.
5,great dvd,i purchased this dvd for my partner and he's been working out with Tony Horton since we got them in the mail. He's lost about 15lbs and gone down two sizes in his waist.
1,This is the awfullest book I have ever read!,"I may have pulled my pants up to my chest and I may have complained about the government without voting, but I read this book and I must say, Give me a Break! Louis Sachar needs to...batten down the hatches. Learn a few things about writing. Make sure he knows that when he has his own son or daughter, he can say, ""Son"" (or daughter) ""You need to batten down the hatches."""
1,Corny but fun,"I thought this book was kind of fun, but very corny. The reason it was kind of fun was because other kids made fun of the main character alot. Other kids would pick on him and it would seem like a real situation. But they made the kid say a bunch of really dumb jokes so it ruined it and made it corny. This book was pretty annoing to read so i give this book 1 star. I wouldnt recommend this book to anyone of any age."
5,A Young Girl's Bravery,"This girl showed so much innovation, bravery and loyalty, it so admirable. Her young sister showed so much loyalty and bravery as well. A very good movie and one I will watch again."
4,Exterminate!,My son loves the Dalek. It is very well done and has a nice weight to it.The head turns and the eye stalk moves. The sucker arm and the ray gun are fixed. My son broke an arm trying to get it to move.Note that there is only ONE Dalek being sold. After looking at the picture my son and I thought there were two. Also the Dalek ships from abroad not US.
5,xanth land is the best land,"The game takes a few minutes to figure out, but is good for hours and hours and hours of fun!!!!!!"
1,Disappointed - no likeable characters.,The best relationship in the entire book was the one between Frannie and Max! Too many toxic people that never resolve any of their issues. I couldn't wait to finish it so that I could be done.
3,So-So Book,"I wanted a book that was about anorexia from the viewpoint of a young woman. What I got was a young woman and all of her complaints about life and trying to find a decent boyfriend, while her sister (a rather small voice in the book) had anorexia. I see that the author was trying to give the viewpoint of a relative of someone with anorexia, but I think the product of this thought was lost somewhere in translation. The read was rather boring throughout parts of the book, and the ending of the book seemed like it was hastily stitched together. I donated my book to the public library after reading it."
2,all that glitters....,The music is great. The dvd was delivered in a timely fashion. and there it all falls apart! This product was promoted as being: 'VERY GOOD'.This is a 2 disc dvd. Disc 1 skipped or froze 4-6 times. Disc 2 did the same 3-4 times. Were this dvd described as 'iffy' I would not have bothered purchasing.I would not purchase from this seller again and I would warn others from it as well.
4,Casino Royale (James Bond),Seeing the movie first before reading the book is not a good ideal i loved the movie the book was a good read
4,Could Have Been Better,This book does an excellant job of introducing 007. In my opinion the best part was the shooting of Le Cheriffe
2,Bond movie is better,Not many times do I find the written story lacking compared to the movie. I kept remembering the movie to provide the imagery of a scene. A fast read.
3,Not the best....,"Casino Royale is the first book of the adventures of James Bond. In some ways, the James Bond from the pages of Ian Fleming's novels is very different.Colder, more ruthless, more direct. No high-tech weapons, no lasers in the watch, no flame throwers in the car, just a few guns, a cool head and a distrustful nature.The story is rough, the word usage not as smooth as some authors and the view point of the novel seems to shift from first person to third person every once and awhile. Ian Flaming also liked to paint a dark picture of human nature. The first paragraph is a dead give away.The saving grace is the fact that Mr. Fleming KNEW what he was writing about. Codes, foreign spies and military intelligence were in his blood. In some ways the book version of James Bond will always be more realistic, more dangerous, more cruel than any actor playing him on the big screen."
4,Great,This book is a good book to start the James bond series tells how he became the way he is . How he is so cold and ruthless. Really good book
5,007,This is one of the best books I have EVER read. I can't wait to read the next book by Ian Fleming.
3,Nothing like they movie,"In my quest to broaden my literary horizons, I have begun reading the Bond books from book 1. It was slow going at first, picked up speed in the middle til it climaxed and then showed down until the end. This is very unlike the movies which seem to be a full on rush from start to finish. I will continue to book 2 in my quest but may not go further depending on the results. I also intend to watch again Casino Royale to see how like the story it is."
1,don't be fooled; this is a very old video,"I am a real hockey fan and after buying the great video ""Wayne Gretzky - above and beyond"" I thought that the Maria Lemieux story would be a similar video: the highlights of a miracle hockey carreer. Well, big disappointments are coming your way when you buy this video. It is all ancient stuff, Mario had not even won his first Stanley Cup when this video was shot. Look at it as a video about Mohammed Ali, which stops just before he wins his Olympic medal. But when you are into antiques, well, this is the video you want."
1,GENERIC CABLE / NOT AS ADVERTISED,"They try and say this is the Cable to go brand, but it is not. They sold me a generic Microprice cable - I had picked this cable because of its quality only to receive a cheap knock off brand.THAT IS VERY BAD BUSINESS!"
1,"Poor performance, lots of noise/interference","Unfortunately this cable didn't perform as expected for me. There is a ton of interference that makes the image on my projector blurry and looks like it's fading off to one side. I'm giving it one star based on it's usability, which is unusable. The cable seems to be pretty sturdy though... so if I ever decide to hang my neighbor's barking dog this would be perfect."
4,The '80s weren't all Bananarama & Frankie Goes To Bollywood,"JD, my favorite bartender at The Buckaroo fairly lassoed me as I walked into the bar one day, & said ""I have got something you will LOVE!"" & slipped JUMPING JIVE in the tape deck. I was floored, & this album became one of my mainstays for years. Eventually, I found that most of this material is covers of tunes by Louis Jordan, but I still hold this disc dear. I play it less now that I've amassed a pile of Louis Jordan discs, but it still stands up well. I would have loved to have seen Joe knock out some of this in a smoky club in Portsmouth. Good stuff!"
4,Joe Jackson - a standard of the 80's,This is a great record-I heard it the first time in the 80's and decided to buy it right away- I held the record for the longest time until I switched to CD. I do recommend to listen to it - a collection of old standards re-engineered for the better.
5,Jazz Lives!,"Joe Jackson ressurects some of the most jivin' Jazz classics ever created, and infuses them with his own swanky style that just makes you want to get up and jive yourself. This CD is recommended to people from New Age Swing junkies to those Classic Jazz lovers."
2,Good book,"Reading the reviews before I received the book, I had plans of returning it unopened. Well curiosity got to me and I opened it and read quickly through it. #1 the print and pictures are too small. #2 the pictures are in black and white . #3..the book appears to be written in the 1950's. Read all the reviews here..and you'll know what you are getting!....The only plus thing is the reduction in the price..I would say the 12.00 price from amazon saves this purchase from being a total disaster. Don't get expressed shipping since it will make the total purchase price 23.00 which is too much for this book.."
4,Hello From Heaven,"For all those who are not quite believers of the ""otherside"" this is a great book."
5,So Helpful in My Grieving,This book was very comforting to me as a new widow. It explained some of the things that were happening between my husband and I after he passed.
4,Very good reading.......,This book will inform and inspireyou so I would recommend this book toanyone who is searching for truthand meaning in life. Very useful.
2,not worth reading,The book contains many stories that could come out of fate magazine. Particularly annoying is the authors' comments after each described event. The autors (as far as I could determine) have neither a scientific nor research background that would justify their evaluations. A book that I would not recommend to anybody other than the gullible.
4,Read,"Im still reading this book. But so far, it's pretty interesting. The condition of the book was not as good as I expected it to be. But that's ok."
5,A Healing Resource,"Hello from Heaven gives comfort to those of us who have had experiences that we don't know how to process. It is an excellent compilation of research and experience sure to give peace to those trying to process their own experiences. I would recommend this book to the skeptical as well, it is great food for thought and further indication that there is much more to our existence than what meets the eye"
1,Total waste of time.,Could not get this to work in my vehicle. Regardless this should be a $2.99 item in my opinion. Wish I had returned. The flap is too flexible and wouldn't fit on my windows.
2,Didn't like it at all,"This cup holder scratched the windows glass of my car, in addition, once you set it up, its like ""hanging loose"", except you're holding something with considerable weight.Didn`t like it at all."
3,Rubberqueen 51216 Cup-N-Can Holder,"I tried them by its design, but they would come out when the window was raised. I also was afraid that they might affect my window tint. So I installed them on the door panel with pop rivets, and so far they are doing a great job holding even those extra large cups."
3,ripped from the headlines,"John likes to run and collect butterflies, sometimes while he is running through the forest he takes along his net, and he never imagined that he would catch a butterfly that would lead to a scandal in his mill town.The butterfly turned out to be a missing link in the evolutionary chhain of butterflies and moths, but the mill workers could care less, they want to keep their jobs and don't want tot stop progress because of an insect.The real conflict arises when John's dad takes the opposite side, but of course as a mill worker you would expect that...it's another thing in a long list that keeps John and his father apart...but now they are even more apart after his father is diagnosed with leukemia.Just how much can John handle...the town is about to explode, his family life is falling apart, and how is he going to get out of this mess?"
5,Tough Workout,This is a very intense and tough workout and exactly what I expected from Bob Harper. I recommend it to anyone!
2,"Learned the basic moves, but boring...","I bought this with a kettlebell to get started. I would have been better off saving the $11 on the DVD, finding an article online (for free) which taught me the exercises, and put on a random documentary while I exercised.That said, if you like that sort of background while you exercise, this would be perfect for you, but I'd rather watch the History channel or something."
1,dont get this movie unless you've never seen it!!,"i thought that this movie really [was weak]. the plot is about as dumb as cats and dogs, mr. deeds, and star wars II. it's confusing because j-lo is going out with one guy and she doesnt like the other but next scene she's eating out with him or something(i dont know!... i hate this movie, and i wouldnt pay a penny for this movie."
1,stupid,This movie was boring! It barely kept my interest! You knew how it was going to end! Its the same story repeated over and over again! don't buy this you won't regret it!
3,Too much Planning,"I'm sitting here and I just finished watching the Wedding Planner. it was so well planned it was predictable.It was a typical .Of course, what do you expect from a Hollywood movie? There was You've got Mail, She's all That ....all those chick flicks.Typical, typical, typical. The most hallarious thing was J.Lo 's father's best friend. He and Matthew M. made the movie. It was a cutsie little movie that you would watch while doing the ironing.~WooWoo"
1,Don't waste your time,"This is just a plain bad movie. The plot does not make any sense and the movie is badly mis-casted. (Jennifer Lopez playing Italian with a TexMex accent???) The director did manage to include some pretty nice scenes though though. So my suggestion is to play the movie, turn off the sound, and play your favorite CDs. You won't miss much."
4,A Cute Kickback Romantic Comedy,"I am probably not a J. Lo fan per se, but I thought she was absolutely perfect and even divinely adorable in this movie. As for Matt McConaughey.....wow, who wouldn't like this guy! This flick wasn't cerebal, but it didn't have to be. I wanted to laugh and get involved and it suited my needs at the moment. (I was in a funk.) It's a feel good movie as well as a comedy of errors. You know things will get complicated and will improbably work out. If that wasn't enough, the story is set in San Francisco and I got to see a favorite city to boot. Anyway, by the last scene, I was funk free and very glad I bought this one."
2,"Same old, same old","There's nothing really exciting inThe Wedding Planner. The plot is cliché - a chance encounter leading to ""love on first sight,"" but one of them is already engaged to get married. I feel like I've seen this story so many times, even though I've only actually watched this movie once. It also wasn't funny enough to be a romantic COMEDY. I can only recall one funny scene - involving a statute and a certain limb that falls off - but the rest is forgettable."
4,Way better than MIM,"well I loved this movie, its funny, its just great! We all know already what is it about. But what I want to say is that is wrong to compare this movie to Maid In Manhattan! Its way better and even a non JLO fan will love it, if he likes comedies, this is the kind of movie that makes you feel 'easy' and enjoy your time! I defenetly recommend it! ;)"
1,Ugh,"This, for me, is one of the worst romantic comedies I've ever seen. Its so mundane and unoriginal and completely not funny. Jennifer Lopez is a one character actor. Honestly. There is no range with her. People pay money to see her films, but really, they are just watching the same movie over and over again. Everyone who watches this movie will know what will happen at the end. Its a given. There is no need for obstacles or pointless drama. Romantic comedies are *almost* all the same. Same characters, same ending. However, what makes this one even more unbearable is the fact that once again, Jennifer Lopez is in it. Even Matt Mcconaughey can't salvage this."
4,UK Hootie,"Hootie are not very well known in the uk, in fact the only mainstream coverage they have ever got is a mention in Friends.I bought the cd in a sale and am glad that i have.I had no idea untill reading the other reviews that they are such a love em or hate em band.I can't understand it, from the first time i listened to the album i feel in love with it.""Hannah Jane"" and ""Hold my hand"" are two great upbeat pop numbers to start the album and then comes my favourite song,""Let her cry"".Its a slow paced love song which is very well writen and creates many images in the mind but it is Darius's powerfull vocals that really make the song.Other stand out tracks are ""Time"", ""Goodbye"" and ""Drowning""(a powerfull attack on racisim). It ts true that some tracks sound similar but there is enough variety to keep you interested.I don't understand any of the reveiws below 3 stars as this is a strong and overall enjoyable debut album.Time to buy the other two then!"
3,Very average,"There's nothing offensive about this CD. There's nothing particularly risky or challenging about it, either. The sound is good, the lyrics are solid, if not spectacular, and there is some good guitar work. The CD got way too much radio play, but then, it was clearly a disk made for radio. There's something manufactured about the whole thing -- there's no edge to it, like say Collective Soul or Melissa Etheridge. The lead singer's voice is good, though it got on my nerves after a while. I can listen to this CD, and I certainly won't give it away (hence the reason it's not getting 2 stars), but I don't know if I'd miss it if I couldn't find it one day. I think if you like straight ahead, non threatening rock, this album will please you. If you're looking for something to make you think, a real musical experience, this isn't it. I listen tend to it every couple months, then forget about."
4,great book,I loved the book... was dissapointed in that she left out many stones I have read about in other books.. so is somewhat limitedgood descriptions though...easy to read...flows good..definatly a must for the person who is studying crystal healing or thinking about it.
4,still one of the best,"This is still one of the best foundation books for getting a basic understanding of Color, crystals and the chakras. This was the first book on crystal healing that I ever got over a decade ago.Its not flashy, it does not try to cover everything, what it does cover it covers very well. It is a small book but adresses the basics in a clear useful way."
4,hotter than a firecracker,"This is one HOT video. Each chapter is sort of a duplicate of each other, but I don't care! I think Shamira is one sensual Hottie to ""enjoy"" to the MAX!"
4,icky fun,"I just don't know how to respond to people who are freaked out by this book -- there isn't anything in here that kids don't think of trying themselves, no matter how ""disturbed"" prudish adults might find it. And, after all, the title of the book is ""That's Disgusting."" It's icky and silly, not scandalous."
4,Harry Potter: Wizard or witch?,"First of all let me say that I did enjoy the movie, although I have never read more than book one.Just one comment, I have never heard of a wizard riding a broom. Wouldn't that make Harry PotterA witch? ..."
4,Capture the Magic with Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,"The First of so far four Harry Potter books introduces you the a boy whos family was killed by the evil Voldemort and by surviving Harry is made a hero in the wizarding world. Follow Harry on an adventure as he escapes his horrible Aunt and Uncle on a journey to Hogwarts: School of Magic and Wizardry. There he meets his best friend Ron apoor boy with a large well known family, Hermione the smart ""mudblood"" who keeps Harry on top of his school work as the tree of them go on many adventures trying to stop the Voldemort and to protect the Sorceror's Stone."
4,What a great suprise,"I enjoy all types of movies and had heard about harry potter, but I had never read any of the books or followed the harry potter stories. I was happily suprised how fun it was to watch and the movie was so entertaining that I bought the books so that I would be ready for the next movie(s). The story was fun to watch along with the special effects which I thought were superb for the child and the adult. It was more than I expected."
4,Love the Book...Like the movie,"This was a good movie. I think Daniel Radcliff was perfect to be Harry Potter. All the the other actors fitted in good enough. But one thing that bothered me was the movie was nothing like the book. They left too many details and scenes out. I think that threw the movie off from being perfect as the book.The acting was pretty good but not that perfect. The special effects impressed me alot especially with the three headed dog, the Qudditch match, the dragon, and the two headed man.Overall I think this was a really good movie. I just bought the movie 2 months ago and every friday night my little sister is like ""let's watch Harry Potter"". I would recommend reading the book first before seeing the movie. The book was better."
1,Digital Copy is EXPIRED,"I love this film, but this review is for this item in particular, which I bought mostly for the digital copy. Much to my dismay, in tiny print on the insert inside, it notes that the code is redeemable for a limited time and expired in December 2010.Suck."
2,So much less than the book,"For a film with this running time, I would have expected a faithful rendition of the book. Instead, the director seems to have placed wierd emphases on the smallest things and dropped others that made more sense. Rowling is a great storyteller with a fine sense of pace and a great way of letting us see through Harry's eyes as he discovers the rich world of his birthright that he's just being exposed to. The film gives very little sense. of that. If they'd been more faithful to Rowling's pacing, things would have worked out a lot better. The wild ride through Gringotts would have been great fun. Dumbledore did not work at all for me and the ending was just altered for no good reason. Overall I'm very disappointed."
4,Harry Potter is amazing!,"I luved this movie, but I wouldn't have minded that they didn't cut it down ( a true Harry Potter fan would probably rather see a three hour totaly unabridged version than the abridged, but it was still amazing!"
1,oh you must be kidding,this movie was highly overrated if you are over the age of 10.it was way too long and if you are an adult there was not enoughexcitement to stay awake for. if you like magic and mystery turnto the wb on thursday nights and watch charmed. much more excitement for an adult than this will ever be. i still cannotfigure out what the hoopla is all about unless you are a child.
2,nothing special,"nothing special, a normal child's movie, the only reason it got nominated for the oscars is because the book is famous. badly edited. the cast was mostly pretty good, but emma watson as hermione? the girl cannot act. she emphasizes ever word she says so that it is more like a naughty laugh track show than a real movie. disappointment galore."
1,Oh. My. Gosh. No.,"The books are a beautiful work of art- terribly ruined by this horrible movie. ""Harry Potter"" has been described as having a new magic that gets kids READING for once, and then what do they do? Make an idiodic movie out of it that leaves out all the good stuff because they only have enough time for the main points. If you really liked the book, do yourself a favor and don't watch the movie, because it messes up how you thought of the book."
2,What the...?,"Hmmm. This is one of the most financially successful movies ever made, based on the equally successful line of books by J. K. Rowling. I'm puzzled by the popularity of this film; the plot is rambling and never really gives the viewer time to get to know the main characters. As such, I found I didn't particularly care about what happened to them. The actors did a fine job (given the material they had to work with), but it just seemed empty to me.Movies based on books always have to omit huge amounts of material but it seems like the characters suffered the most in this adaptation. I'd much rather have had less of the sportplayed with flying broomsticks (and the giant chess game) and much more characterization."
2,Grown Potter fans and Muggles Beware,"I believe that this DVD has confirmed my place in the muggle population. While I am sure that many of harry's pre-teen fans are thrilled to have to play games to get to certain features on the bonus disk I eventually turned off the player in disgust after easter egg hunting for half an hour. While this movie is meant to be a ""kids"" film, I think that the DVD producers could have taken hints from other DVD's marketed mainly to the younger portion of the population (eg Disney movies) that have games, for those viewers interested in playing, separate from things such as featurettes and deleted scenes, so that those who are either uninterested in playing games or just too much of a muggle to figure them out can enjoy the extras just the same.I am really disappointed. I love the books and the movie, but this DVD is nothing like I hoped it would be."
3,A Bit Too Simple.,"The first time I saw ""HARRY POTTER"" I liked it, the effects were great, the acting I guess was O.K., the score was great too, but what bothered me was that it seemed to be a more childish and simpler than the original book. The original book could be likable for all agaes(supposedly), but the movie can't. One disapointment in the movie was that the scary parts were scarier written down in the book than to be actually seen in the movie. And anyone over 12 years old wouldn't likely be caught laughing at the ""supposed to be funny"" scenes. Even though the special features should be interesting, I would reccomend renting it first befor you run off to your nearest movie store and buying it and not know what your getting."
5,WOW!,"This was the greatest DVD I have ever seen in my entire life! Filled with fun and mystery, it's great for all ages!"
2,Harry Otter,"Being able to order this product online and immediately watch it is very convenient. However, it would pause mid-film to load the movie again.!"
4,Very Faithful Beginning.,"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a wonderful movie that does an outstanding job at bringing the excellent story of the book to life in a way faithful to the original material. The story unfolds in the same way in the movie as it does in the book so this is a very satisfying Harry potter movie. The casting is fantastic. In particular,Richard Harris was a PERFECT Dumbledore. And John Willams score for this movie is a treasure to behold. My favorite movie theme music ever! I go with 4 stars instead of 5 only because the visual effects were subpar (they would be fantastic in all 7 other HP movies). I strongly recommend this movie for people of all ages."
3,Okay,"This movie would be good---If u were into that sorta thing. I personally don't believe in witchcraft or wizardry, but it was an interesting movie. It's funny at times, and scary at times. It kinda makes me wonder when it's no longer a new release in the rental store---what section it would belong in. All in all, it was okay."
2,Blue Ray disc didn't work!,"I would have given this 5 stars except that for some reason, the In-Movie Experience would not play. I could play both movies (theatrical version and extended) but not this Special Feature. The strange thing is, that I couldn't get the In-Movie Experience to pay on my Year 2 blue ray disc either! Has anyone else had this problem? I am going to return them in exchange for new copies and hopefully it will work and I can make this a 5 star review!!"
1,Just for kids,"If your kids are Harry Potter fans, they will like this or any other movie about Harry Potter.For any other person who wishes to see a quality movie and not a character legend, this is a bad, boring, absurd and a waste of time."
3,This Movie was OKAY,"This movie I liked a lot. I have to say the book is a lot better. This movie seems to have been a bit boring at times and not always following the book. Although, I do think this movie had some excellent graphics. Fluffy was amazing, the graphics I mean. The casting, I think, was perfect. They chose the best people they could find. I also think they look extroardinarily like I pictured them in the book. I do still think that this movie could've been better directed. The movie practically had them walking around half of the time to a class or other. This is what I had to say on this movie. I still think, though, the books were a lot better."
5,"Great movie, very close to the book","I don't know what these other people are whining about. This movie follows the book very closely. The special effects are impressive, and the story line is great.As others have said, I highly recommend you read the book BEFORE you watch the movie, but if you have no intention of reading the book, it's a great film by itself."
4,The movie is ok,"I think it does a very good job of retelling the books I mean they practically take the chapters word for word. Harry Potter also provides some wonderful cameo roles for 2 very fine english actors namly Allien Rickmen and John C(from Monty Python). It suffers from from only one thing the kids sound like they are reading from the script of a middle school play. It is not really an issue for your kids, and you will probably be too busy paying attention to the special effects to notice."
5,Harry Potter,"The DVD version of Harry Potter was exactly what I expected it to be. It was something that required concentration and a knowledge of what was happening in the untones of the movie to understand. It truly followed the book. The added scenes were fantastic and the photography was outstanding. The second DVD.....I am having trouble getting through the mazes, but that is life."
1,Get The Widescreen,"This film was brilliant and surprisingly good, but make sure you get the widescreen edition, otherwise you are missing a lot, and I mean a lot of visuals. I've seen both versions and the full screen and widescreen editions, and the full screen is so very not worth it.The film itself, although it's target audience is kids 8-12 was a shock to me, I didn't believe for one minute I would enjoy it and I really did. Check out the movie, but be SURE TO GET THE WIDESCREEN version, otherwise you are just ripping your self off 30 percent of the picture!"
3,Harry Potter 1 is OK,"When I first saw this movie in the theaters, I loved the movie and saw it twice, but as the newer ones came out I started to move farther and farther away from it. For example, I saw 1 two times in the theaters, I saw 2 three times, I saw 3 two times and I saw 4 four times. It skips around alot and you hardly know where you are in it. The movie is good but WATCH OUT!"
5,"""Followed the book exactly!""","I've only seen the theatrical release of this movie, but it was the bomb! My favorite scene was when Hermione, Harry, and Ron battle the Mountain Troll. The most action-packed scene was the Quidditch game, at which ended with Harry spitting out the Golden Snitch, therefore winning the game over to Gryffindor (I don't know if that's how you spell it or not). It was funny when Harry talked to the boa constrictor, it scared Dudley. Anyway, this was a really cool movie, and was suspenseful at times. I definately recommend this!"
2,Pretty vacant,"This movie is simplistic, dull, and derivative escapist fantasy. It is something like 36 hours long and most of the movie doesn't even have an antagonist... just feel-good filler to make the audience forget their unimaginative existence for a while.However, there is one good thing about it. It annoys the bible-thumping religious fanatics down south. An unintentional side effect, probably, but a good thing none the less. Keep at it Harry!"
2,F,"Well, YES, the movie was good. That's why we bought the video. So we could see the ADDITIONAL FOOTAGE (heavily advertised). Don't buy this for the additional footage. It's only about two minutes worth of material that was rightfully edited out of the movie (boring)."
2,No closed captions for hearing impaired made for a sucky experience.,I will not purchase Amazon movies again until this is remedied. I cannot hear well and I will not hurt my ears for a product that can easily include CC. Check out Hulu if you need to figure out how to do this.It's a fairly popular movie so not really any excuse when I can download an .srt file from the web.
4,Harry Potter - was the hd worth it?,"We rented this through our amazon Prime membership. I was torn about paying the extra buck for HD. I am not sure it was worth it because I don't think the original was in hd. Amazon offers old old movies in hd for an extra fee, which I find annoying because they are going to be fuzzy no matter what. I feel the same way here, although I wish I could know ahead of time the difference before I shell out the extra cash."
5,The Wonders of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,"This movie is one of the best movies I have seen in theatres that actually has awesome special effects and is almost identical to the book. chris Columbus did an excellent job directing this movie, as did Daniel Radcliffe and the other actors. I must say that this si the best movie that is going to hit the shelves in 2002."
3,Not as good as the Book,"If you have only read the first chapter of the first book you will think that this is 5 star quiality but if have read the whole book this is a terrible based feature full of phony props,stupid jokes, and some bad acting. The added footage is horrorble too.Read the book instead."
1,Not Worth your Time,"This movie is definitly not worth the time of teens and above. The computer graphics aren't very good and the movie doesn't stay to the five-star book's story line. I'm a HUGE Harry Potter fan and by watching the movie it completely ruined the book for me. The movie seemed to try to cram too many chapters into a too short movie (even though the movie was deathly long it seemed). The actor that plays Harry Potter [is bad] at acting while the makers of the movie didn't even bother to follow the features (Black hair, green eyes) that the Harry Potter in the book had. The movie is definitly not well made and if you haven't seen either yet you should definitly only read the book if you are 12 years old or older."
3,needs a little push,"I admit, I watched this movie because of the hype surrounding the nerdy little orphan boy with wizard powers. Although ""Harry Potter"" was somewhat engaging, I am uncertain about how much it parallels with the book, and also, who the target audience is. Some scenes may seem too frightening for younger ones, but the plot itself is a little juvenile for adults. Some ideas are clever and original, but Rowling instead should be credited. The movie was not as great as I had expected, and the hype it receives is questionable. Not bad for rental though."
3,too much hype!!!,"After all the,(Oh this movie is the best!, best thing I have ever seen!) I was really let down. Yes the special effects were great (that's the only reason it got 3 stars from me!)but as far as ""the greatest story ever put to film"" is quite the miss quote."
5,Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone- A Clasic,"I recently saw this video, and imediatly loved it, I have read all four books, and am, anticipating the release of the fith book. I would recomend this particular movie to anyone, parents, children, grandparents, teachers, anyone who enjoys reading would love this movie, and I do believe that people who don't even enjoy reading would love this movie! I think it's the best thing i've seen in years! I must admit that I even went back and saw the movie once after already seeing it with a friend, who also had read the books, and enjoyed them too. You will fall in love with the charcters, while watching this film.Well, this is all I have to say for now, but I highly encourage you to go see this movie, or at least rent it, and i'm sure after doing that, you will want to buy it!"
3,For HP fans- this is and always has been a must,"but you've gotta be kidding me. This DVD was a Target Exclusive that came out at the same time the Ultimate Edition Blu Ray's did. This DVD was $8 on sale- $11 regular. The extra content is the same stuff you've seen a dozen times when ABC broadcast HP:SS, so it's not new unless you've missed their showing the last 4 years it's been playing. But to pay THIS price when it was on store shelves for 25%???WOW- this is crazy. For 7 minutes???"
1,Should be able to download to my itunes!!,I bought this thinking it was just a digital copy that I could run from my itunes but I guess I did not see the fine print that it is only for Windows. Won't be buying anymore Amazon downloadable videos.
3,in my opinion the best harry potter movie,"when the movie first came out around in thanksgiving of 2001 i thought it would be boring but my younger brother told me to give the movie a try and i am glad i listened to him this movie has everything from action, laughs, decent acting, and of course magic to make it into a memorable film the movie never got too boring i liked that the movie celebrated each holiday like halloween and christmas then when it is june the studnets go back home until september to make it believe like they really was at school young harry potter reminds me of me because he is worship by everyone because of his amazing accomplishments at the school being the youngest seeker ever saving the school from the evil zoldemot the movie is very long but it needed to be some everyone could understand what harry potter and the movie was all about my second favorite harry potter film is between harry potter 2 and the new harry potter movie that's in theatres now"
3,Disappointment...,"I'm quite a fan of the Harry Potter books and was really excited to see the film. However, I did not fully enjoy it due to the fact that the film missed out on many several important scenes.I think that the movie was too abitious. I hope that the next one will be better."
4,Great fun!,"Having read the books, I really looked forward to this movie. It did not disappoint! Not much more to say on that!I only had one problem with the dvd. There are so many special features that I cannot find the deleted scenes!"
4,Easter Eggs??,"Not having read the book, i really enjoyed this flick and if fact was surprised at how much i liked it. I can totally understand why the books appeal to old and young kids.I wondered if buying the Widescreen Edition and viewing it on a small tv (less than 20 in) would take away from the viewing experience, I am happy to say it did not.The DVD itself has some kinda cool sections for kids to check out and interact with. Unlike some other dvds, you actually have to hunt for the deleted scenes or at the very least pay attention to menus."
5,A wonderful story,"If you've read the book first, you will still really enjoy this detailed and wonderful account of Harry Potter and his new adventures in a magical world within our world. I have read and listened to the books-on-tape, and I really enjoyed the film. The acting was excellent. A different kind of role for Richard Harris (""A Man Called Horse"" and ""Man in the Wilderness""). The brick wall on Diaganon Alley was a brilliant piece of special effect work. This is a film that you can watch again and again."
1,marketing hype ....,"--It is not bad at all, but simply NOT deserve the attention. I have to admit the marketing is incredible effective! Waaaaaaaay over rated!It really deserves 2 or 3 stars, but I'd like to compensate ....--"
4,Great !!,"Finally a movie the whole family can enjoy, If you liked Willow?Then you will like Harry Potter"
3,Why must we play a goofy game?,"Generally when companies advertise deleted scenes on DVD, it means the owner can access them at will. This is not the case with Harry Potter. The deleted scenes were one of the reasons I purchased this two DVD set. However, I discovered much to my chagrin that I have to play a video game to see them.Although the Warner Brothers website shows the steps to access the deleted scenes, it is nevertheless a tremendous nuisance. I have never seen these scenes. I really have no time for 18-step games. I sent an e-mail to Warner Brothers asking them to send me a ""disk-2"" with no goofy access procedures. I doubt if they will, but it is fair request. Disk-1 was okay."
5,Bonnie Tyler From the Heart,I think it is her best CD. Great enjoyable songs. She is a outstanding singer... thanks Rowdy
3,Problematic Fun,"This was an entertaining book filled with facts I have never heard of before. However . . . the authors tend to describe both the Americans and English with broad and cliched strokes. And some of their ""facts"" about American women in the 19th century were inaccurate."
3,Interesting but not engaging.,"I expected more of a novel instead of a book full of facts. Much of the book, I skimmed through. The author haddone a lot of research and some of it was interesting, but I thought if she had written a novel based on the factsof one of these couples, it would have been more interesting to me."
3,not as good as some,"I was very excited to get this book as I am a fan of ""Downton Abbey."" I've ordered and read as many nonfiction books about the period as I can find. This one was a disappointment. The organization/layout was poor. Almost every story was interrupted by little pop-up stories/pictures. There were pictures and stories that needed to be organized together, not separated by other articles. The information was repeated at times, so continuity seemed weak. I think two much better books to read would be ""Lady Almina and the Story of the Real Downton Abbey"" and ""Consuelo and Alva Vanderbilt: the Story of a Daughter and a Mother."" Both of those are very well-written and very interesting. ""To Marry an English Lord"" seems very pale by comparison.."
4,Interesting book,"I read mostly history from 1100s to 1600s, so this was an interesting departure. I did learn some things and it was an easy read, though not the best book by any means."
3,To Marry An English Lord,"This was an interesting book, in a historical way. It is not in story form, but reads more like a history book. This is OK, but it seemed to be more of the same after more of the same. The facts were interesting, but they were always the same facts, just different people."
1,Disappointed,"The authors clearly did a great deal of research, but all those facts did not translate into an interesting story for the reader. I can't imagine how this book received 4.5 stars on the rating scale since it was very frustrating to read. Honestly, I read only about half of the book before giving up! I love reading a well written book where the characters come alive on the page, but that was lacking in this book."
5,To Marry in the British Aristocracy,"A funny but all too warts and all picture of American heiresses who married into the British aristocracy, from getting the ""link"" to marrying--to divorce. It is a wonderful book and explains the snobbery, Anglo-Mania that was afflicting the Gilded Age."
3,Interesting stuff about the pettiness of people,"This is about the mores of the day. Fashion, The whose who of the day, and some interesting items about some of the better known pillars of society back at the turn of the century. How they lived and who they loved etc. Got a little bit boring when they talked about people that are lesser known."
1,Interesting,"An interesting insight to the life of the mega-rich young ladies that were so desperate to get a ""titled"" Englishman and then realized, too late, that what they ended up with was far different from what they expected."
2,Names names names!,"I had hoped for a more chronological, historical recount of the American invasion of Britain, but unless you are much better than I am at keeping track of names, it can be very hard to follow who has done precisely what and in what chronological order. Following who is related to whom is another matter altogether. There are some nice anecdotes in the book, but don't try to tie them into the larger picture unless you have several genealogical trees of the American and British elite handy."
2,boring and repititous,Started out well but got bogged down in the endless repeats; would not suggest this to others. pictures were interesting though.
2,Is this yoga?,"I've taken different styles of yoga classes and I've not seen much of the movements on this tape. It's beyond gentle. It's one step away from ""Sit and Be Fit"". I am 100lbs. overweight, able to walk 5 miles,strong &/or flexible in some muscle groups, tight &/or weak in others. This tape was way, way too easy for me. I wish had not wasted the money. ""Yoga for Weight Loss"" with its 3 levels of proficiency demonstrated, is a better beginning level YOGA video, although there's nothing weight loss specific about it, just basic Iyengar style yoga. I gave this 2 stars because there may be someone out there for whom this is just right, someone more out of shape, inactive, or infirm than me."
3,Not my favorite from Donald Hall,"I have enjoyed many publications from Donald Hall. His childrens books are especially welcome in our house.But, the combination of stories published in this edition left an unpleasant aftertaste for me. Was Hall maybe a bit too self-satified or a bit too curmudgeonly for me? Or perhaps I was in the wrong state of mind when I read it?Whatever the case, I will continue to seek out his other books but I don't plan to re-read this compilation."
4,Take A Walk in the New Hampshire Woods,"This is a great book for those who love to idle down a country road and find life as it should be lived. Simpler, more meaningful times. Love the style and tempo of his writing. And thanks for sharing and bringing the reader to a feeling of inner calm and Life has meaning!!"
2,Arsenic and Old,"I like Cary Grant's movies, but this movie was horid.This was a morbid and sick film(I know its a comedy)(but even a comedy should have substance and a good respectable character)Summary: It was about a man (Cary Grant) sticking up for his two psychotic, serial murderer aunts. The whole story is about him trying to cover the crimes as policeman and strangers come in all the while ignoring this beautiful fiance (played by Priscilla Lane).I would suggest ""To Catch a Thief."""
4,Arsenic & Old Lace,"Very pleased with my purchase. the order was shipped complete and arrived just in time for a Halloween movie night with my church youth group. I was disappointed that it was colorized. I didn't notice if it said that in the description, but I'm a B&W; purist and had the students all ready to watch a real old movie. Oh well. Not a deal-breaker.Overall happy with the service, shipping, price, and product."
1,arsenic and old lace,It would not play in my DVD player or any other DVD player that I tried. I have returned it and do not plan on ordering any more DVD from Amazon.
5,Arsenic and Old Lace,"I received the movie in a few days in plain wrapper, but the quality was excellent. I will look for this seller again."
4,"GOOD HARMONY, LESS QUALITY PAPER",My pastor recommended this Harmony and is it very good. I have never read one before and if you want to get the life of Jesus in chronological perspective; this is the way to do it. I was surprised at the way the paper felt. It's sort of like newspaper; must be recycled. I like my books I intend to keep forever to be more substantial.
5,Both the toddlers love this movie!,"My 20 month old and my three year old both love this movie and would watch it over and over and over. We've had it for three weeks now, and they are still not bored with it. The animation is wonderful, the stories are appropriate, and as a Mom of four- I am absolutely impressed!"
5,AWESOME!!,"I wish they made more of these. My son loves it. He's 2. and he asks.. ""what's doing"" haha. but he likes it and I gotta say it's one of my favorites about using your imagionation."
3,Competent true crime with insightful moments,"This book is at its best when Putsata Reang is portraying the friendship between teen killers David Anderson & Alex Baranyi & her account of the microculture the boys were in--centered on a local Denny's--is convincing. The book is weakened by following a familiar true crime formula that includes a chunk of the usual trial description, none of which is especially noteworthy & which becomes irritating when we're actually subjected to a second trial of one of the characters. The book would have been improved by more exploration of the friendship between Anderson & Baranyi & more insight relating them to other incidents. Reang is astute to make the comparison with Leopold & Loeb. I just wish there'd been more of this kind of thing & less formula."
2,Some Missing Elements,"Reang gives a decent overview of Bellevue, Washington, and its inhabitants, but it is clearly obvious she is an outsider. Small details such as identifying a public school as Catholic, and putting far too much of an emphasis on what the legal teams wore to court took away from the power of the story itself. Reads more like a primer for a ""movie of the week"" than anything else."
2,not for car,"working perfect outside the car, but only 50% of chance to point the right direction when it sit inside your car,"
1,don't waste your money!,"Type S 10002 Black CompassThis compass worked fine in the HOUSE, but once in the vehicle, it became stuck, did not turn properly, and the adhesive for the installation was weak. This is the first thing I have purchased on Amazon that was a dud... It's definitely a dud though... get something else."
3,Anne of Avonlea,"This is a sequel to Anne of Green Gables. It is very good, heart-warming story. Good for the whole family."
5,Great workout!,"I really liked this workout. Just when you think you had enough pushups, you're happy to go to abs....then you're ready to give the abs a break and basically happy to get back to pushups. Great to take with you when traveling, as you don't need any equipment. Awesome!"
4,Short and Sweet,This is a good upper body workout..you'll definitely feel it the next day if you do the whole thing. It's short (about 30 min) and pushup and situps only so not sure how many calories you'll burn but as a add in to a cardio workout I think it's a great quick workout to do.
2,Boring,My 20 month old daughter is okay with it... maybe she needs to be older. I think it's boring. Same kids through out singing children's songs... maybe it's just not for me. I wish i never purchased it.
1,Right box wrong shoe,I have received a box with 9 1/2 on the box which is what I ordered. Inside the box is a size 7 stamped on the shoe. What the heck do I DO WITH A SHOE 1 1/2 size too small.
3,This book is not really as good as people think,"I have to said this is the 1st SolidWorks book i purchased. But base on his ""step-by-step"" approach, i found that there are many steps were skip and the drawing doesnt turn out as it said in the book. Some of the instrucions dont make any sense at all."
5,It was a good year,"Even though there are only four songs on this album, it swerves through dozens of melodic movements. It's one of those albums that you just feed it into your player and enjoy 42 minutes of instrumental bliss."
1,Painful,"This is possibly the worse movie I have ever seen. I had read a brief summary of this film and the story seemed interesting. Talk about doing absolutely nothing with a potentially good idea. The acting is so bad; especially the role of Damian, the geek/nerd. We have seen this type of character over and over in teen flicks but never before have I been subjected to such a bad performance, the stereotype times ten.How any of these characters would get together in the first place is beyond belief. The dialogue throughout the entire thing is unbearable.If you plan to watch this movie, you might want to consider a lobotomy first.Truly painful."
5,I love these more than my child!,"These stacking robots are sooo much fun! I actually think I like them more than my 3-year old boy, but I think he will grow into them. Right now, he just likes to play pretend with them, like when I stack them some elaborate way, he likes to knock them down and take them all to the ""hospital."" I had to find robots for him for Xmas, as it was one of only two things he asked for, and I am so happy with these!"
3,Robots are Chipping,"My boys (ages 4 & 6)j ust got this toy. They love balancing the robots into various designs. They even act out scenarios with the little robots (good guys vs bad). Unfortunately, the robots are made out of MDF and are already chipping after one day of use. Why can't toy makers make quality toys. I'll pay the extra money for real wood toys! Now I'm going to have to ask the kids' grandpa to duplicate the robots with real wood using the jigsaw."
3,"Not a best-seller, but *I* really like it!","Lost my old album years ago, and can't find this in stores. Thanks Amazon! It'll be good to reinstate it to my collection. Can't give it 5 stars, due to lack of general popularity, but Foreigner Suite has sentimental value for me."
4,Ok but not best......,"I enjoyed reading about the child actor Derek Masters who comes to Stoneybrooke in the story, since I'm so into theatre myself, but Jessi should stick to ballet. She doesn't know ANYTHING about acting! It's not as easy as she thinks. All of the sudden, she just think's she'll be famous and she'll be ""chosen"". She should start out smaller, with theatre, before looking into agents and TV and modeling. Plus, there's a lot of rejection in the show biz world, and Jessi doesn't even give that thought! It isn't that easy. Do not be fooled - Jessi and Ann M. Martin do not know what they are talking about when they talk show business."
4,"Awesome Book, this version is BIG","This book was my daughter's favorite bedtime story ten years ago. Now I bought it for my newborn niece. The illustrations are phenomenal and the phrasing of the book is beautiful, lyrical and perfect for little ones. Just know this printing is an oversized softcover. I thought I was purchasing the standard sized hardcover."
4,Time for Bed,"I think it would be a 5 star if on every page it said the same text, instead of changing ""bed"" to ""sleep"", etc."
2,written in with marker,"I expect a used item to show some wear, but not have marking pen writting on the pages.I couldn't show this book to my 3 yr old granddaughter and then expect her not to write in books."
5,Best Baby Book Ever...,This book has the most beautiful animal illustrations...It's a must have bedtime book for little ones. A traditional gift for newborns in our family.
2,HUGE book,"So I didn't realize when I ordered this that it was a 'Big Book', so its my own fault, but seriously why would anyone want a book this big!?!? I mean, I can't even believe they make something so absurd. I have no clue what I'll do with this giant book. Keep it under the bed I guess."
5,What is that?,"I love this Series, it's absolutely Fantastic, I would encourage anyone that's into Crime Shows to get this Series. I love it."
3,Not that great.,"Apparantly, Atlantic Records was trying to milk one more album from the Bon Scott era. This one is weak. The best track is Jailbreak. It would be nice if they would release the bands first couple of albums in their true import form. There are other albums to get by this band. This is one that you should get to complete your collection."
3,Good if you're a Bon Scott fan,"This is some old stuff from 75-76, unreleased until now in the U.S. Good, but unexceptional stuff that sounds just like the High Voltage album."
4,Excellent.....Only needs more songs.,"This EP, or mini-album, is composed of 5 songs. Why not more? Who knows? They have a handful of more unreleased numbers that they could of added to this cannon. But, like I said, who knows? Aside all of that, I think this is a Must-have. Simply because you couldn't find these tracks anywhere else (unless you have the Australian T.N.T or High Voltage). The best songs on here is Soul Stripper.....actually, ALL of these songs are the best, because there is only 5 of them! They could of added songs like, Cold-Hearted Man, Welfare, Love Song, and tons more."
2,"FUN, BUT MILES AWAY FROM WHAT THEY ACHIEVED LATER !","This is funny. I can remember the video-clip from the song ""JAILBREAK"": hillarious! Bon and Angus making a escape from prison, and Bon getting shot in the end.. Fun! But, musically speaking, it was just a beginning for the band (it has a cover! ), and has only 5 songs. It was just an introduction for one of the best rock bands of all times (who, unfortunately, never wanted to write good lyrics...)"
1,TRIPE!!,"This is the worst Steve hackett album i have ever heard. that is rubbish i love W&W; and love steve hackett guitar playing, i have been creating blood on the rooftops lots of times. Get 'Cured' instead, that is excellent and has steves vocals on EVERY track! if you want to listen to **** music, buy this. (i mean, hope our love will last!) IT HAS A WOMAN SINGER!!BUY THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK."
4,Color of a Forest,"Mali Kuli may be an imaginary forest in an imaginary African country, but the reality it represents rings true. Kiss aptly depicts the color of a forest--green from a distance, but on closer look one would see yellow, red, black and so on. Her eco-thriller reflects this phenomenon--one color on the surface but as one delves deeper, the layers of intrigue unfold. A colorful cast of characters adds spark to the action. From pygmies to poachers, diplomats, scientists, undercover agents and aid workers, Kiss makes each individual come to life. She definitely writes with the authority of someone who has met those people and lived among them."
3,Good concert but ...,"Received the disk. It plays ok in my computer and since I use a computer attached to HD Projector, and Altec Lansing Voice of the Theater speakers, the image and audio is fine. My problem - I didn't get the second disk. I was really looking forward to it.As far as Ana is concerned, she is simply one of the finest vocalists today. It is a shame that she gets no traction in the US."
2,Horrible Condition,"I was extremely excited to receive this item, but i was also just as disappointed with the condition that these boots were in. The box was covered in dust and the boots had numerous scruffs and discoloration all over the rubber."
2,OK....,"Boots arrived with mud splatters and huge scuffs down the sides....a return that they have just put a new tag on...they could have at least cleaned the mud splatters off.... had to return them and get another pair. I am a size 8 shoe and these ran true to size for me (toe wise) but I have thin,long feet with a high arch because of my high arch the offer little support and my foot pops up and down when walking....for sure not worth 60.00...but an OK buy for 23.00."
3,Not as powerful as Let There Be Rock,"Here is the follow-up to Let There Be Rock. This album toned down the overdriven amps of it's predecessor, and that is not necessarily a good thing. A Somewhat boogie/blues album that just doesn't seem finished. George Young's production is not bad, however. Powerage just doesn't seem to have too much rage with exception of maybe Riff Raff. Not too many of the songs are that memorable. Sin City is a concert fave, as was Riff Raff, but everything else? Not imperative. The European LP contained Cold Hearted Man instead of the single Rock N Roll Damnation- about an even exchange, plus many of the cuts had different edits and mixes- worth finding if you are a completist."
3,ok,"This is the worst AC/DC album i have, (i have Dirty Deeds, Flick of the Switch, and This one) but it's still pretty good. Though some of the songs are the best that they made, (ex rock'n'roll damnation & sin city) some songs, like riff raff, are just plain FORGETTABLE."
5,KICKED US IN THE TEETH,"THIS ALBUM IS SO UNDERRATED IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. IT IS NO HIGHWAY TO HELL, BUT WHAT IS? THE LYRICS ARE GREAT AND IT PLANTS ASEED WITH IT'S BLUESY RIFFS THAT WERE TO FOLLOW WITH THEIR MOST RECENT RELEASES. LOOKING BACK THIS IS WHERE AC/DC WANTED TO BE ALL ALONG. JUST ASK THEM."
5,Something Good About Cows,"For meat-eaters out there, Seth Godin provides a safe, satisfying and stimulating serving in 99 Cows. This collection does exactly what it should; providing practical examples that demonstrate how simple it can be to excel. Any project will be better after reading Purple Cow and this ""lab manual"" side dish."
4,From an econ student's point of view,This book was a very easy read. The chapters were well written and the material was explained thoroughly using many graphs to demonstrate the concepts. Another part of this book that makes it good are the case studies that deal with the topic of the chapter at hand. If this is the economic textbook that your professor assigns you to read then don't worry because this book is straight forward and easy to understand.
2,Not for me.,This book carries a lot of assumptions on the authors beliefs. It does not give practical advice on how to read auras.
5,The Falcon Mystery Movie Collection Vol 1,"FINALLY!, THE GREAT 'CAMPY' MYSTERIES! George Sanders, the self described 'Cad', always with the proverbial Tongue in Cheek, provides great entertainment as the Falcon, as well as what I refer to, as the Alternate Falcon character, Tom Conway. Light 'who dun it' mystery drama with comedic moments that keep it light. Acceptable scripts, character actors, production and several quotable, fun, one-liners. Add gowns by notable Renie, which add the designer-y, fashion aspect."
3,Oh my! And I really wanted to love these. Save the packaging too!,"I've seen these movies many times and love them all. But I must very reluctantly agree with other reviewers these are mediocre prints of very, very good 40's detective movies. From WB yet! I was hoping for some outstanding cleaned up and stabilized discs. No such luck. Not much more to say. Oh yes...keep your packaging material there was only one disc in the box (yes they shorted me a disc, I can't believe the sloppiness, as I said...from WB yet!!). Well I won't be buying any more that look and feel like this rendition. I wonder if they outsourced the manufacture and the OEM just doesn't care?"
4,The Falcon's Brother,"It could be, we all need The Falcon to save us from disaster. Well, he's here in seven second features, of variable quality, but not enjoyment. And, there are two Falcons. George Sanders and his brother, Tom Conway. Conway was more reserved, more handsome, and despite Sanders' superior career, more The Falcon. The dvd set of three is well presented. For those of us who remember...Further Thought: No sticking problems."
4,The hacker smackdown!,"Electronic rights advocate B.T. Slader (aka ""Darc Fyber"") tells all! ""The Internet Hero"" chronicles the creation and exploits of ""Darc Fyber,"" a self-styled digital knight who takes on the malicious hackers of the world with the assistance of some techno-savvy friends, both real and virtual. Along the way, Fyber assists the Feds in the hacker crackdown, averts World War Three (?) and discovers a possibly extraterrestrial signal emanating from the electronic wildnerness of New Mexico. Slader's book is entertaining and accessible, rendering the online world in everyday terms for those who still think a ""server"" is someone you meet in a restaurant."
4,"Too Short, Too Short!","Angel Sanctuary was so amzingly good, but it was just too short. There were a few iffy parts, but every anime has its flaws. However, I'd have to say, if you have an aversion to ""wrong"" pairings aka bigbrotherXlittlesister aka incest then you shouldn't watch this because their relationship plays a big role. As for me, incest doesn't bother me in the least, in fact, it was my whole motivation for purchasing this anime. (ok i'm sick, im wrong. geez!)if you like the whole incestual pairing thing then i would also reccomend Lament of the Lamb. The manga is too drawn out and angsty (9 volumes) but the anime is concise (4 episodes) and has good subtitles (no dubs here). It's midly incestuous and is about vampires. its kinda depresing tho. *shrugs*"
3,Missing something but good,"Well, I suppose I'm on a bit of a biased here since I read and watch the original Angel Sanctuary series (non-english), but I can still say that if you're an anime fan, this is a series you *must* get into. Often people complain about some details included -- crossdressing, drug abuse, drinking, blood, gore, religious topics, etc.. To tell the truth, that's what most anime/manga is like. It's normal, and if you want to be able to handle normal anime, watch this. The OVA chopped a good portion of the magnificent manga series out, but it's art is still a good reproduction of Karoi Yuki's and it's storyline is compelling. Don't be turned off by the ""controversial topics""...you'll hardly notice them."
3,Does what it should do,"I bought this as an inexpensive kitchen knife storage bar. It does well for this application: the magnets are strong so that the knives are held securely to the bar and have little tendency to slip, much less fall off. It is long enough to easily hold several knives and kitchen shears. My only complaint is that the plastic endcaps supplied with the bar will not stay on."
5,Great stool for many places,"I love this stool. I use it in many places in my house. Most of the time I use it in my kichen (cutting fruits, veges, making pancakes). It is also great for extra seating for guests especially fitting kids into the dinning room table. And it is easily stored in a closet."
5,These Aussies are Awesome,"I saw them on t.v. on a womens concert and they sang ""i'll find you"" which just knocked my socks off and stuck in my head...i did a little research and found the cd on amazon...all the songs are good, especially fade which is melancholy and beautiful...why a group like this doesn't get more attention is beyond me but the media is so hyped on bimbo's and not for real women...get the album!!"
3,So cheesy (but in an entertaining way)!,"See this movie if the following applies to you:(a) You're a fencer, (b) with a good sense of the ridiculous, (c) fencing friends to watch with, (d) and you've all had a few beers (or one too many sabre whips to the head).If all of these characteristics remind you of you, then I think you will thoroughly enjoy this movie for its oh-so-rare combination of camp, cheese, and swords. If not, you might like it anyhow, but consider yourself warned!"
5,The Truth Must Be Told,"You know, a few years back a couple of boys in this little band called Japan decided ""hey, we should make music"". Little did they know, THEY WERE ALREADY IN A BAND. When they realised this, they broke up. Jansen/Barbierri seem to be a solid team of hipsters, out there making obscure music more obscure. Aside from their release as The Dolphin Brothers, they hadn't done a pop album since Japan. And this album is no exception. With guest bassist Mick Karn, this would be the predecessor for the trio building their own label, Medium."
4,Classic post WWII symbolism,"The highly symbolic story of a German soldier who returns home to find that Germany has left the war behind, and him with it. Each character he encounters symbolizes the ways in which the war, permanently imprinted on the heart of the soldier, has been forgotten - none of which are pure or truthful. Text is in German in most versions of this book."
2,Godzilla Vs Megalon NOT included?!,"So I bought this solely to get the Godzilla flick. I receive it and the other movies advertised are the same, but instead of Godzilla vs. Megalon, there's some STUPID flick called The Giant Gila Monster! WTF? That is NOT Godzilla! Amazon advertised it as including it, but the package clearly states THE GIAN GILA MONSTER. Apparently this pack USED to include the Godzilla flick, but for some reason they got rid of it. Don't get this if it's Godzilla you're after. He's MIA."
2,Wheres the grit?,"God, what an awful album. I was and still am a fan of Simple Minds, mostly their early work, but I was sorely disappointed with this, even after trying REAL HARD to like it. I cant believe they actually went ahead and made such a terrible, pretentious album. I mean, I know Jim Kerr and Co. are somewhat pretentious, but come on, there is a point where the effort to achieve that ""stadium rock"" sound turns into a bunch of pompous garbage. I understand what they were trying to accomplish with this, and the sentiment involved, but the result is an album that is muddled it is so overly produced, bloated and boring. Simple Minds lost it on this album. Its like they decided to focus more on how they sounded instead of ACTUAL SONGS. I can appreciate most of their early body of work, and even some of the stuff after this album, but SFY represents the worst of what 80's rock was about. Excessive production can ruin a great band."
3,"Just Okay, not really great","I am a period drama junky. I did not get to view this one on PBS when it aired so I was delighted that I could get it on DVD. It comes with four episodes each an hour or so long and frankly I thought each one was redundant. This story could have been told easily in 2 or three episodes at the most. This was so repetitive that I actually thought I had cued up the wrong episode. That said the DeFoe story is a classic and worth the watch. But this only rates an ""okay"" from me."
5,Great serie,"It is a great serie, much better than the movie with Robin Wright. If you don't know Alex, like I do, it is even more fascinating to look at her. She is a beautiful woman, and a great actress, and she deserved the fame she got after this masterpiece! I've watched this serie, for a hundred times but it is still great!"
4,A Mesmerizing Edge Of Your Seat Puzzle !,"Lucio Fulci's almost forgotten gem ""The Psychic""(aka:Five Notes In Black) is not only one of the maestro's most brilliant pieces of cinema but it's more so proof that the god of gore could make a thriller just as creepy as ""The Beyond"",""House By The Cemetary"" and ""Zombi 2"" with out large amounts of blood and gore. Dardano Sacchetti penned up a whopper of a giallo here and Fulci and the rest of the film crew(actors/musicians/editors/costume designers and such) did a mesmerizing job bringing Sacchetti's story/screenplay to life. As a big Lucio Fulci fan I am more than delighted to add this masterpiece to my collection. Great film!"
1,When I wish upon a star...,"...it will be to erase this stain on the Disney legacy. I'm apparently in the minority on this from the other reviews, and if you really love this album, I apologize. I honestly love Disney songs, but please go out and buy your favorite soundtracks or even a sing-along CD for the kids before you even consider listening to this album. In fairness, there are some decent versions, but there are two songs you need to run far, far away from. First, Sinead's ""Someday my Prince Will Come"", sounds like it's sung by a suicidal stalker; I expected the lyrics to continue ""...and I will stab him through the heart, repeatedly."" Aaron Neville tries to make the ""Mickey Mouse March"" into a sexy ballad, which succeeded in making my skin crawl. I don't want to associate seductive love songs and Mickey, and his version is even over the top for a 70's era sultry ballad. It may be the worst re-interpretation of a song that I've heard in my entire life."
5,"I Choose ""The Family Man""","Great film! Definitely not what I expected. I expected more side-splitting humor...but instead I was treated to a great Hollywood-style love story...with guts. I will never forget the line, ""I choose us."" It says it all, especially if you've ever been deeply in love...at the crossroads...torn between leaving or staying. This is a must for lovers. Nicholas and Tea were superb. All 5 stars!!!!!"
2,Truly disappointing; leaves a bad taste,"This is the typical film that looks uplifting when you see it, but that when afterwards you start thinking about it, you realize how phony and manipulative it is. Here, Nicolas Cage is an arrogant yuppie businessman in Manhattan, who one day wakes up and finds himself in a paralell world, living a supposedly dreadful life in suburban New Jersey with his wife (her former girlfriend, in his previous life) and his (previously non existent) kids. The beautiful Tea Leoni, as the wife, deserved better than to be in this movie. The movie chastises the main character for not raising a family, yet the film shows family life as dreadful. The idea that Nicolas Cage had to sacrifice a family in order to get ahead in business is also phony. Most male yuppies are married; it's the women that usually have to made those sacrifices. Also, this movie is supposedly critical of heartless capitalism, yet it ends up celebrating it."
2,this movie hurt me,"I don't get it. Don't waste time, money, gas, sleep, etc on this trash. Peace to the streets."
1,I fell asleep,C'mon - could this movie be any more predictable? Even my girlfriend fell asleep. Complete waste of time.
5,"Great message, great story, great movie!","I watch this every Christmas even though the movie is not marketed as a ""Christmas Movie"". It is somewhat a similiar story of ""It's a Wonderful Life"". I always apreciate what I have after watching this movie."
3,he was the PRESIDENT of the COMPANY??? wtheck,loved this film b/c it emphasized the simple joys of life BUT my huge issue is when he shows his wife the PERKS of an E N T R Y level job it is a gorgeous decorated house with perks and then when you see him in his PENTHOUSE apartment as P_RESIDENT of the company it is VOID of ANYTHING beautiful....looks like a dang college dorm so what is the fake view of wealth here.... do you have to make him look soooooo pathetic and suffering to enable the jersey bs house w/kids.... stupid... but was special to see the old NY skyline with the towers... how we were sooooo unprepped for that event... Tia was superb!
3,A Better Ending,"I was left flat at the ending, as although they do end up together, the kids are not with them. Better ending would have Nick C go to London, fall asleep on flight, have the story as a dream. In London he is not sure what to believe. He wanders around and runs into the ""angel"" (Don Cheadle), who with a wink of the eye, or some similar gesture, lets Nick know that it was a dream, but it is the actual future, and that he has a big choice to make, so Nick gets back on a plane, and comes back, to be with Tea L and have kids, etc. Obviously like ""It's a Wonderful Life"", but so what, it works better than existing ending."
4,Predictable but still very entertaining,As your sitting there watching this movie you can predict a lot of what is going to happen towards then end but the story is still fun. It seems to go a little too fast and could have spent some more time with him and the family in general but I still like it. It is very entertaining and for those that have kids you will like it.
5,great family movie,"Excellent Christmas movie! If you havent seen it, go see it! Nicolas Cage at his best with Tea Leoni! I've waited for this movie to come out on bluray for a long time and was surprised to see it on Amazon."
5,Amazed,"Briliant, just simply Briliant, preformances By Cage and Leoni. I can't remember watching a movie that made me think questions like ""what if I had made different choses in my life, where would I be?"""
2,"Okay, but lacked anything memorable.","There is nothing bad about this movie. Unfortunately nothing bad does not mean that the movie is really good. There is nothing memorable about this movie. It's a feel good romance. A good choice to watch once with your wife when there's nothing good on TV. If you watch it a second time you'll notice all the plot holes and loose ends. It loses its luster.What would have really helped this movie along is a little more depth - perhaps additional character development of the little girl Annie who provides the warm humor, but too little of it - or maybe an extra 20 minutes tacked onto the end to resolve (at least partially) some of the dangling plot lines."
3,Doesn't compare to the images of the mind's eye.,"As a long-standing Pern fan, I asked for this book as a present years ago while it was still in print. I loved it at the time, and still enjoy it thoroughly, but in the end, Robin Wood's images are just that; her interpretation of characters that I had realized in my own mind. Some of her paintings are wonderful, especially the portrait of Mirrim and Path, and it was fun to try to identify some of her source material, such as her 'American Gothic' rendition of Menolly's parents. Her portrait of Lessa... well, that one I didn't agree with at all. She looks like a pinched old woman with a needle-like chin, incongruously paired with shockingly black hair. A book for true fans only."
5,I bought more of these,"I gifted 2 of these to my friend's kids as b'day presents and they both loved it, so easy to use and durable. The only thing is that the stickies loose their glue over time but you can still use the toy for fun without the stickies and they dont hurt. So much fun, I bought more for myself and my cousins."
2,Too hard to use,"Looks nice, but was very difficult for my 4 year old son to use. You HAVE to pull the bow ALL the way back every time or the darts will get out of line and not shoot at all. (The darts are on a clip and it moves the next dart into position as you pull back the bow.) It is very hard to pull it all the way back. If you don't pull it all the way back even once, none of the darts will shoot unless you reload the clip. I would say that a child needs to be 7 or 8 to get it to work consistently, but it would not be as fun for that age."
3,Hmmm,"My best guess is that this is an ""R"" rated version of a hard core movie. Ihave seen this done with another movie. It was "" It's Called Murder Baby"".This was the ""R"" rated title and I forgot what the hard core title was. Anyway, I suspect that this is the case here, which actually adds a little substance to the movie by concentrating more on the story and less on the sex. I recognized a whole slew of porn stars, including Ron Jeremy,in this thing, that is why I suspect that there is a Hard core version of this somewhere under a different title. All things considered, it was OK, not great, but watchable. It is probably better suited to rental rather than sale. After watching it, I was glad that it wasn't a hard core flick, by abbreviating the sex it left more time for a story. Charlie S."
1,Poorly Made... Don't buy,"I know it might be bad but never thought it would be this bad. thin as can be, poor quality."
2,Harsh Watch,"Harsh Times, another Christian Bale movie. I love and adore all the acting that Bale does. This movie however fails to deliver in what I would normally consider the quality level that he normally lives up to. The movie is slow and sometimes painful to watch. With Christian Bale I never think twice about purchasing a movie. I should have done my research though on this one. Bale plays essentially a street thug that feels his life has fallen apart when he didn't make it to the LAPD on his last attempt. He lives the drunken life of a street thug and the violence, while may fit the tone of the movie does not quite gel properly. The movie feels disjointed and awkward."
3,"Awesome performances, wasted","This movie could have been great, hey everybody needs a grim peek at hopelessness now and then, but the script just wasn't worthy of the actors outstanding performances.The two male leads gave fantastic oscar-worthy performances. Especially Freddie Rodrigues as Jim Davis' best friend (& boyfriend of Eva Longoria's character Sylvia). Excellent, ""Dude"".All in all I can't fault the actors. The screenplay just didn't catch and hold, and Bale's character was poorly written in that it really took awhile to catch onto him being insane and care a darn about what happened to him or his pal."
3,"Turgid Stuff, This","While no one would fault a writer/director from wanting to depict just how low life can descend, making a film script that is three-quarters repeated expletives and tiresome current slang terms ('dude', 'dog' etc in place of names) wears thin after the first half hour of HARSH TIMES. One wonders if David Ayer wanted to create the feeling in the theater (or living room!) just with the tenor of the film.The story is so minimal that it needn't be summarized other than to say it is the downward spiral of an ex-army man (Christian Bale) and a wishy-washy burned out failure (Freddy Rodriguez) as they ignore the needs of the women who care about them (a strong Eva Longoria) and choose instead to drink, smoke pot, and act like bad children.The cast is a strong one - in search of a script that means something - but even Christian Bale and Freddy Rodriguez can't rescue this deflating balloon. It is just a sad film all the way around. Grady Harp, March 07"
2,Talk about used!,"Dvd is in really bad condition, im surprized it even played. I should have paid half of what i paid for this product"
1,Surprisingly Bad,"Oddly enough, considering the cast and the high quality of acting I was very disappointed in this movie. The story is both boring and exceedingly predicable. Could any two human beings be so monumentally screwed up and succeed in life at any level? The lead character is not only a lowly mess but a complete looser. Not only did I find it hard to relate to the character, it got to the point I didn't even care. I turned the movie off within just minutes from the end not being able to stomach it anymore.Its just a study in the worst of humanity slithering around in alcohol abuse, drug abuse and misery. This movie proves if you give good actors a poor story a shallow script and pathetic dialog you can't expect them to pull off a decent movie."
2,Bova used to be good,"I used to really enjoy Ben Bova's books. Examples such as ""Colony"" and ""Millennium"" spring to mind. Unfortunately his more recent works (including this one) tend to read like poorly written soap operas. The science is still good though in this world where hard science fiction seems to be disappearing in favour of fantasy. This will probably keep me buying his novels but I do it with more trepidation than before."
2,Missing Pictures,"I purchased the Quality Classics version of Du Marier's Pictorial Satire to see the illustrations that were not in the public domain version. Unfortunately Quality's version is also missing the pictures. In fact, none of the versions available on Amazon show illustrations in the sample files."
4,Atmospheric and Bass Heavy,"What's not to like about Mick Karn's bass playing? More than David Sylvan's vocals, his fretless playing defines the band's sound and you can hear his influence in the bass playing of Duran Duran's John Taylor, Pino Palladino and others. The repetitive nature of Japan's songs is the only reason this album gets four stars."
2,Only one song saves this CD,"I'm a big fan of all house music, including acid. There's lots of great house tracks out there, but not on this CD. In my opinion, there's only one track on here that makes it worth getting: This is Acid by Maurice. If you can't find this track on any other CD, then and only then would I recommend buying this CD. Otherwise, save your money."
1,NOT AT ALL WORTH IT!!,"The drivers never worked and the computer I was useing it on was not old the computer was running Windows Xp. It was like installing an old printer that did not work. And if you have any problem to bad there is no company to call, no web site nothing. I was just trying to stay out of having to mess around with the inside of my computer. but in the end that was exactly what I had to do save your self the problem. Don't buy this. Do what in the end I had to do get the d-link ethernet adater. It will save time and money. GO D-LINK!!~"
1,Don't Buy,This product is a waste of money it doesn't even work the LCD doesn't lite up. My system doesn't acknowledge it's existence because it's a dead end. Good thing it's only 3 dollars or I would be very aggravated.
1,junk,i found it under my wii lan adapter search and finding it under the search i thought it would work but it does now now i have a usless thing that i can not use it sucks
1,Do not buy,It did not come with a CD only a piece of paper telling you to go to a website to download the driver. This product does not work well. Many websites do not load.
3,"Difficult startup, good use","The adaptor itself works great.. The only problem is that the drivers are only available on minidisk so I couldn't just use it out of the box on my tablet.. I had to find a computer that could play minidisk and extract the drivers that way. After applying them it works great for what I need it for, which is to have internet access outside of wifi zones making my tablet into a replacement laptop.While it's no 1Gb/s connection, it's solid and good enough for most applications."
4,Needed more down,"These were advertised as down pillows, however they are mostly feather. Good pillows for the money. They fluff up nicely."
2,Pillows,"pillows flatten out to nothing. Woke up with stiff neck, my husband did as well. I would not recommend these."
2,they smell like a wet dog,"the pillows are nice if you sleep on your back but on your side or stomach they smell like a wet dog, although that does not seem to bother my cat. they make great pet beds"
1,"""FLAT"" Quality","I just go the pillows and they are not full like the picture...VERY FLAT!!!! I put my hand on the pillow and it went right to the bed! NOT full at all!!! Low Quality, low filling and fell flat on the ""job"" I am sending them back right now!"
4,It's so fluffy!,It's so fluffy I could die is literally what my husband said when we got these! They are nice I feel they could use some more stuffing! but nice!
5,LOVE.,Love these pillows. Haven't had any issues with down feathers poking me yet and they stay full instead of flattening out right away.
3,Good because its 2 for 1.,"Both these pillows went flat after about 5 months. They go flat so you constantly have to puff them up. If they were only stuffed a little bit more, they would be perfect..."
1,Very disappointed,"These pillows were very flat considering they are feather pillows. They also made an awful crinkling sound. I sent them back and had a bad experience with the seller. The only thing they might be good enough for would be as throw pillows. Find the real thing - and buy from AMAZON, not a seller who won't refund shipping or help with return shipping. Bad experience."
5,feather pillows nice quality,"good quality, nice sized, soft feather pillows. use them 25/7 as I am bed ridden and disabled and have to stay in bed! will buy them again in the future."
4,Showcases the strong roots of the Genesis era,"A very satisfying album, which once again highlights the strong musical themes which were an unmistakeable part of the 1970s Genesis songbook. It is only when we hear these individual works that we can trace the origins of each of the group pieces. Hackett manages in this album, to clearly express his own directions, and often maintains the Genesis atmosphere. Hackett clearly had stonger influence than the popular press admits. This is a very good album with which to start discovering the Hackett repertoire."
5,Excellent,"This is an excellent starter book for learning how to draw in pen. This is the first drawing book that I have read that starts exercises using a large grid pattern which aides in maintaining the proper perspective of the sketch as you draw it. The author shows the final rendered drawing and then two sample drawings for each exercise - how to do basic outline and then individual sections of the sketch on where to put markings, shade, etc as you build up on your outline. The book covers landscape, animals, people, flowers, & buildings. Good book to have in your library."
2,The craft of drawing?,"If you want to learn a very basic ""method"" for creating a likeness (say for the purposes of primary school teachers), this may be the book for you. If you have artistic aspirations, however, I cannot recommend it. Much better are Herold Speed's ""The practice and science of drawing"" and Anthony Ryder's ""The complete guide to figure drawing"". You can't go wrong with either (or both) of these."
5,Very happy with this product,"There's nothing worse than grimy dishes after you wash them... or foggy drinking glasses that never sparkle. I was always annoyed by how my dishes looked after being washed (honestly, I was probably the only one who would notice... but it bugged me!), but after the first time I used this Jet Dry, I was in clean dish heaven. I mean, there's a specific spot in the dishwasher for it... That must mean it's kind of important, right??I also love that my dishes come out of the dishwasher a bit dryer instead of flooded. They're not perfect, but I didn't expect them to be. I'll definitely be purchasing Jet Dry in the future and probably a lot of it... I do a lot of dishes!"
2,Music MP3,"I was trying to find music,specifically,Hoyt Axton Mp3s,I was UN-aware that I was taken to a vinyl record area,I ordered the music and it arrived and was what it was,according to the info after I checked!!! It would be better business if Amazon would accurately maintain their products so that people looking for Mp3s got Mp3s and not vinyl,or,something else!! I should have looked more carefully and not trusted amazon,my bad!! It won't happen again Amazon,you have turned this customer off,again,I hope for the Last Time!!!"
4,Microsoft Habu Laser Gaming Mouse,"Pro's- Looks great, very precise movement, excelent performance and software.Con's- one of the resolution buttons sticks occasionally, the pointer isnt great in accuracy.Overall a nice mouse worth the money."
1,big disappointment,"Wasn't what I expected... Within a week I just gave it to my friend. Now I come over his house, he leave it off to the side too. I brought a Death Adder after I gave the Habu away... love my DA!"
4,WoW,"Before I got this mouse, I was using a non-gaming mouse to play my favorite fps, Counter-Strike Source. This mouse has honestly boosted my skill. If you're not used to a mouse of this caliber, it will be hard to get the hang of at first. The high dpi was awkward to me for awhile. Other than that I love the thing! I suggest it to anyone who asks about it. Go Microsoft! Go Amazon.com!"
4,"Tough installation, great mouse","I read the existing reviews and purchased this device anyway, hoping that the software/driver issues had been resolved. Be warned - they are not. I luckily found a well-written procedure to follow; I never would have figured it out myself. Subsequently, the mouse works fine. It has great response, good weight, and decent feel. The level of customization is superior. I recommend this mouse, just be prepared on the install, and take your time."
4,Pretty Dark,"Flick Of The Switch, Back In Black, and this one ...""For Those About To Rock"" were my first AC/DC albums I was exposed to in the early 80's. Of those 3 this one stands out just as much as Back In Black for me. So many anthems, and it's good to listen to in the fall around Halloween for songs such as ""Evil Walks"", ""Night Of The Long Knives"", and ""C.O.D"". Then of course there are the other rockers/favs in the title track; ""Put The Finger On You"", ""Inject The Venom"", and ""Let's Get It Up"", I even like ""Breaking The Rules"".The only two not played very often are ""Snowballed"" and ""Spellbound"", and that's probably just because of being too busy playing those other songs mentioned over and over. Stronger than Flick of The Switch, more variety for sure than that one, and to me almost even with Back In Black at times, this one is a very pleasant, albeit dark and heavy, anthemic hard rock."
5,Great album,"A great follow up to Back in Black, it rocks just as hard as it did thirty odd years ago."
3,Classic 70s rock,"as a collector of classic rock music,I was happy to have found this cd to add to my ACDC collection. I was pleasantly surprised to find it in very excellant condition,considering I purchased it used. and it took only a week to receive it."
2,"For Those About to Rip Themselves Off, We Salute You","OK, so the title track is a great song, cannons and all, and Inject the Venom and Put the Finger on You are both decent rockers. The rest, however, is the sign of a once-good band now simply sticking to the formula that brought them success. Consider the following: Virtually every song on For Those about to Rock We Salute You is a midtempo heavy rocker about sex. Virtually every song on Back in Black was a midtempo heavy rocker about sex. Same with Highway to Hell, and Powerage, and Let There Be Rock, and... well, pretty much every AC/DC album. But while those albums were great, this one sucks. Just look at some of the cliched song titles: Let's Get It Up, Evil Walks, Spellbound..."
2,The begining of the decline,"In my humble opinion, this is the begining of AC/DC's decline. Starting with this album, the quality of the band's studio work plummeted. However, the title track stands up. For such a powerful song, it's worth the price of the CD. Brian's voice goes out right around this time period, which is kind of sad because on Back in Black he sang like a supercharged John Fogerty."
4,Decent,"That last dude is laughable. Checkout his ratings he seemsto hate everything besides video games and Zombie movies. Heactually gave a zombie 5 stars and called a movie of a watereddown genre""Move of the year"" no horror movie is a movie ofthe year... Especially when it's about something stupid likezombies. How can you like zombie movies and then think you canafford to call other people retards?Now... about the Album....Not the best work... The best songs are the title track andLets get it up and Evil Walks. The rest is just average. Lookfor the albums before this one because they are all better."
3,"Great information, uninspiring presentation","I can't argue with the reviewers who point out that Knapp and Hall are two very distinguished scholars who know their stuff. I also can't argue with the fact that this book is very thorough, jam-packed with fascinating information, and one of the most useful guides you can get about the many different aspects of nonverbal human communication. What I will say is that this book is painfully DULL. The authors try to liven things up by adding a humorous story or a joke on occasion, but the feel of the book remains like a textbook in the worst possible sense. It's faceless, lifeless, and hard to finish. It's a crime that such fascinating information has to be delivered in such a dry, tiresome style. Get this book if you're interested in nonverbal, but also keep a cup of coffee handy."
5,This is my favorite Mike Oldfield record,"An excellent instrumental first track, the classic Moonlight Shadow and the spatiality sound of Foreign Affair make it a fantastic CD."
4,Variety yet seemless integration,"I think this is one of the best examples of Mike Oldfield's work from the 80's, combining both examples of his unique blend of instrumental composition and vocal input from a number of talented singers."
3,Good up to 1/2,"Some of Mike Oldfield CD's are half songs with words and half instrumental. I find that I prefer his instrumentals more, so I burned a CD with just instrumentals on it from his CD,s entitled Discovery, Island, and Crises. I found that I listened to it more then I would have otherwise. And remember to listen with headphones now and then, you'll be amazed."
2,bastante malo,"No comprendo porqué solo comentan los discos aquellas personas que se ""tragan"" todo lo que sea del artista en cuestión. No nos engañemos, si te gusta Mike Oldfield, éste se acaba,como mucho en QE2. Este disco en concreto, no es sino una repetición de clichés ya usados y una serie de cancioncillas de las que hay a miles.Lo dicho, un disco bastante malo"
5,Excellent,"this album is really worth the money you pay for it. you'll never get bored of it, i promise. the first track is a nice instrumental that is wild at times and very gentle and pleasant at others. i know this description is corny, but you've got the hear this work of art to appreciate its beauty. it is pure emotion. the other tracks (all with lyrics except for taurus 3) are heart-breakingly haunting, especially 'moonlight shadow' (which was inspired by john lennon's untimely and violent death). the melody of this song doesn't let you go and will haunt you for ever (in a pleasant way). i think mike oldfield is one of the best and most talented musicians around. buy this album, you won't regret it."
3,Bonus tracks are more of the same,"I WOULD CHANGE THIS TO 5 STARS, BUT AMAZON WON'T LET ME.I think the bonus tracks actually detract from the quality of this CD. The first 4 tracks are just different versions on songs already on the CD. But, I can't really tell the difference between the new and the original. And they are good music but not the best on the CD."
4,Greatest Australian Movie,"Young Einstein is a excellent movie in all aspects of a great film.The acting is great. The location of course makes the movie good. Nothing like good ol Australia in a movie to add the desired essence of a awesome film.The Soundtrack. I love it, I don't like the style of the music that the bands present on it, though I do love the actual songs, They are quite catchy and the added dailouge to the soundtrack just gives the soundtrack more reply value.The cinematography is another nice feature of this film. Though I saw this movie in its original widescreen presenation only once. Watching the pan and scan copy stills give us a great impression of how good the cinematopraphy actually is. The subtle message I am sending across? Release this movie on DVD! Its one that needs to be owned on the latest technology so we can never wear it out *Looks at old VHS copy* heheMy rambling on has proberly made everyone close this window by now so I better stop here."
1,This is one of the dumbest movies in history,Some movies are so bad they are funny inadvertantly. Not this one. Fingernails on a chalk board is preferable to sitting through this horribly unfunny movie. Yahoo (you can't be) Serious is just not a funny guy. I still can't believe I paid admission to watch this.
4,Goofy but a lot of fun,We had this one on a tape for years and we thought it was funny enough to replace it with a DVD.
2,This product is worthless unless your home is already really well insulated,"I bought a house that used these panels as the main heating source throughout the house. Unless your attic, walls, and floors are insulated this product is worthless. My electric bill was astronomical and the house didn't get warmer than like 63 degrees because the very small amount of heat that they produced was quickly sucked out of the house. I froze for two winters (my water pipes froze too because the house couldn't stay warm enough) but I just installed central gas heat. Gas may be just as expensive, but at least I'll be warm."
3,Hackett's first solo album gives a taste of things to come,"This is Steve Hackett's first solo album, recorded BEFORE he left Genesis. There are several good songs here, but Hackett seems to be using the album to get his feet wet and explore the range of his songwriting ability. He hadn't yet developed the signature sound that peaked on ""Spectral Mornings"" and ""Defector"". ""Ace of Wands"" is the standout track here. Hackett's brother John, who later became a regular member of his band, plays flute.(1=poor 2=mediocre 3=pretty good 4=very good 5=phenomenal)"
5,One Of The Best...,"Genesis was never the same after Steve Hackett left, but the world is a better place because he did. As a solo artist, he has been able to reach much further than the confines of a band would have ever allowed. And there's so much more listening enjoyment because he left. This first solo release by a Genesis band member has Steve propped up by his then band mates. It's certainly dated, but the music nevertheless stands up well after almost 30 years. Taken in context, it offered a glimpse of what Steve Hackett had in store for us.This is a great introduction to his music and a perfect place to start."
1,"Great movie, But where is the volume?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","Nevermind that the seller that i ordered this from failed to ship this copy of Black Cobra 2 to me within a fast time range, When i finally got it yesterday, The dvd had like almost no volume for the movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is a shame because i actually kinda like this movie seeing as how i think it had better action scenes than the original, shoddier Black Cobra. What's funny is that the stupid menu on this dvd has rather loud volume. Just wish the movie was the same.....Don't order this copy of this movie. I'm gonna be trashing this travesty of a dvd and i'll be ordering another copy of this movie from a different dvd company. Maybe Legacy's copy of this movie is better....."
2,ON PAR WITH ITS PREDECESSOR; 2.5 STARS,"ALMOST BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL. THIS TIME AROUND, ROBERT MALONE [FRED WILLIAMSON] IS TEAMED UP WITH AN INTERPOL AGENT [NICHOLAS HAMMOND] IN THE PHILLIPINES. THIS SEQUEL, LIKE THE FIRST MOVIE, IS OCCASIONALLY FUN. BUT IT SUFFERS FROM PRACTICALLY THE SAME PROBLEMS THAT THE FIRST FILM SUFFERED FROM; SHODDY FILMING, BAD ACTING, LACK OF PLOT, AND IT'S PREDICTABLE. BUT, WHEN IT COMES TO THE ACTION, IT'S WORTH WATCHING. THIS SEQUEL IS PRETTY MUCH YOUR USUAL BUDDY COP MOVIE. AND IF YOU SEEN ONE BUDDY COP MOVIE, YOU PRETTY MUCH SEEN MOST OF THEM. THOUGH THE FIRST FILM WAS MARGINALLY BETTER, THIS IS A HALFWAY DECENT SEQUEL. AT LEAST IT WILL GIVE YOU A LITTLE SOMETHING TO DO WHEN YOU'RE BORED. NICHOLAS HAMMOND, WHO'S BEST KNOWN FOR HIS PORTRAYAL OF THE 1ST LIVE-ACTION SPIDERMAN ON THE UNSUCESSFUL 1977 TV SERIES, DOES GOOD IN THIS MOVIE AS FRED WILLIAMSON'S PARTNER."
4,Classic!,"I loved this one growing up. Really. Amelia Bedelia always choose the funniest possible interpretation of words, and her name rhymes! What's not to love?The one thing I'd be concerned about is that a lot of the usages in this book are going to be unfamiliar to your young kid. I don't think many of us say ""draw the curtains"" anymore, and even if we do, we probably don't often talk about ""trimming"" steak (with or without lace!) or ""dressing"" chicken, at least, not around our kids. Maybe we should, but we don't.So this book might be better saved for read-aloud time than read-alone time."
5,kids love this silly book,"This humorous story about a literal-minded maid will make advanced beginning readers laugh as they learn about idioms. Kids love the goofy things that Amelia does. She is a nice person but, as our children say, not too bright."
2,Do not recommend this book!,"I was shocked to see that this book has received such marvelous reviews!I am a big fan of anybody that has deserved success on the same level as Bill Bradley. However, this simple fact does not mean that the product of his interesting life will be a good book.Simply, this book was very plain and details Bradley's life at Princeton, inside and outside the classroom and on the basketball court. The stories are not interesting and there is too much worship given to Senator Bill. I found many of the ""facts"" divulged by the author to be incredibly hard to believe.If you like the modern-day NBA at all you will absolutely hate this book.If you like the modern-day NBA, politics and the Golden Age of sports you will give this book two stars on a five-star scale!"
5,Who is that girl?!,"I've been a Mikie fan from the tubeular bells days and on . . . I baught the casette version in Italy, when I was in the navy (1986), on a whim. It turned out to be the best M.O. recording I've ever heard (For pop that is). My first impression was... Mikie boy!, Where did you meet that girl!! I'ts weird but, when ever I hear her, she reminds me of Jane Seimore...??? Needless to say, I was plesantly suprised.From what I hear (From Europieans) He's prety big there. Does any body know who that lady is???"
1,Junk Junk Junk,"The low price of this piece of C....p made me leery, but I ordered anyway. Big mistake. It arrive with some pieces broken. Even if it had arrived in perfect condition, It would have been worth maybe a 1.00Very cheap plastic construction, the thin plastic on button broke the third push. If Amazon had any standards at all they would ditch this group of products until someone offered one that would last more than one evening. Check the reviews of this same product as a 4 deck shuffler to see same results. The WORST thing that I have ever bought online."
1,Falling apart,"I purchased several of these braces to replace 2 that I've used for several years. However, within 2 weeks the stitching is falling apart. They don't look like they'll last another month. I was highly disappointed."
2,Noodling/Fooling around and calling it progressive rock,"One reason why groups like this did not succeed in the progressive rock heyday, and others did, was because they used the term progressive rock as an excuse to noodle/fool around and call them compositions.There were plenty of fusion bands like Collessium that went into instrumental excursions, but were very professional about it.Camel, another band from the Canterbury scene, was able to use instrumental excursions as part of the composition in a profession mannerThis appears to be just joking around in the studio, and putting out an album"
3,Interesting but unsatisfying,"Bova paints an imaginative picture of the new frontier out in the asteroid belt. He throws in cliches such as shoddy law makers, grubby prospectors, powerful bad guys, powerless good guy and of course love triangles. This book focuses on Lars & Mandy vs our favourite Humpy the bad dude. It would have been nicer to develop more the impact of the fusion drive, the asteriod mining on the world. He tries to throw in tantalizing bits of information in the way David Brin's Earth was written but does a woeful job. I wonder why I thought his previous book was good..."
3,Space opera with bad science,"This is pretty light reading, so despite myself, I've enjoyed reading it. The characters aren't very deep, and have one-dimensional motives. Humphries gets away with anything he wants to do, because, for some reason, nobody ever investigates the bad things he does, like burning up all of Lar's supplies.Some of the science in the book is just blatantly wrong, though, especially where Bova (or a ghost writer?) talks about going into a high speed orbit around an asteroid (huh?) or picking an ""orbit"" around an asteroid to match its spin. There are some things he does in the book that JUST DON'T WORK. It's almost as bad as Armageddon in that respect. But, taking it as space opera; light fiction with not much depth, it's still fun to read."
3,A historical period meladrama,"Beautifuly filmed but slow and a bit boreing, Mozart's Sister is a low key drama about a girls talent being the wall that isolates her from a meaningful life. Some good story here, but the subtitles push it into the catagory of a mediocre film."
5,Great Book,"The rough guides dc is great because it contains a lot of sophisticated information and stories. It has a couple lists and tours, I believe, as well as stories. The book includes material on museum collections. This is great because instead of carrying around and wasting so many maps fliers, etc. You have one book with all you need (including maps) in an intelligent format. This book contains hostels, and hotels...Right up my alley."
4,"Great set of punches, but the paint is irritating","This is a great low cost punch set. I would have given it 5 stars but in one instance the paint on the punch actually kept it from going in as far as I needed. There is no need for the paint to be there on the punch portion of the punch. If you have a tight fit for what you are doing, you may want to consider another set."
4,Stanley Punch Set,"I got this punch set to help in servicing my different pneumatic tools that I have collected. The set seems to be of very high quality and I'm sure this is exactly what most people are looking for in a punch set. Unfortunately, the size punch that I really need doesn't seem to be in this set. The punch that I have used is a little tricky because it just is a bit too small for what I need, but the next size up in this set does not fit in the hole that I need it to fit in. All that being said, this set was too good of quality for me to return it and I'm sure I'll be able to use it for other purposes."
2,Plastic Coating on Striking End Cracks,"I used 2 of the 6 punches. The very first time each one was used to countersick some drywall nails, the yellow plastic coating cracked. I used a small metal hammer to strike the punches. What good is the coating for?"
4,Great movie but....,"Ok, this movie has great cast, great visuals, funny at times and just pure mental at times. But as far as the plot goes, its confusing as all hell. I have seen the movie 3 times and still dont get it. Maybe i am just dumb but i don't think so. In the speacial features Woody Harleson even says after they were done making the movie he still had no idea what it was about. Other then that if your a fan weird plot lines and drug use mixed with great animation you will love this. Substance D awaits you!"
4,Trippy Movie Based On A Strange Book,"This movie's animation style was very enjoyable to watch. The acting was very good, the use of sound was complementary and not distracting, and despite this being essentially an animation, the actors were able to express their characters emotions well.What is hard to watch is how strange of a story this is. My wife and I had both read the book prior to seeing the film and the film is true to the strangeness of the book. To be clear, this book is by and large faithful to the text -- it is the source material that is pretty ""out there"".We enjoyed this movie a great deal and wish more films were shot with this style of animation. We'd be leery to share the film with friends unfamiliar with the text as the story can be confusing."
2,Perfect cure for Insomnia,"As an avid moviegoer and someone who learned the English language by going to the movies as a child, the movie has to be pretty bad/boring if I doze off. And this movie was that bad. My Dinner with Andre was less boring. Unless you're a fan of the book/author and into this sci-fi cult thing, don't waste your time. I only watched it because I thought E&R; gave it two thumbs up but surely I was mistaken?Let's keep it simple. This movie is NOT entertainment."
1,krappy cartoon movie,pissed me off. this cartoon may have made a good movie if they had filmed it as one. i kept looking for bugs bunny or goofy to pop out. cant tell you if it is any good. i stopped it as soon as it started.
2,"Good story, poor execution","This movie has the same problems as _New Rose Hotel_. It's based on an edgy sophisticated work of fiction, but the film itself comes off as rather boring. The heavily photoshopped/rotoscoped look was distracting and did not really add anything to the film -- not in the way that the comic-book-style rotoscoping that worked so well in _Sin City_."
1,OOOOH rotoscope. Big deal. Who cares!!!,"That part alone was not a redeeming factor for the film. I'm not going to even get into the fact that the actors performances were dull to say the least, or that the plot from beginning to end was lackluster. I actually wasted $3.99 renting this schlock on ON DEMAND. Boy, do I want my 4 bucks back. Basically, all this movie was about was five crackheads running around playing crackhead games. If I wanted to see that, I could have saved my money and walked around the corner. Furthermore, I could have got a camcorder and made a movie about a bunch of fiends sitting around the house babbling about nonsense for two hours!! Would have saved millions. To sum up, I would like to advise folks to please avoid this as if it was the Ebola virus!!!"
1,Form over substance,"Form over substance! Dialogue is monotonous and sleep-inducing. Plot is not terribly intriguing. The only cool aspect is the ""cartoonization"" of the actors. Overall, go watch something else."
3,My opinion...of the book and of some reviewers,"It's a rather informative book in all. I must say, however, that some of the people who bash the book are not very literate (putting it kindly) and are more than likely Masons themselves. They must know that the more they trash a book like this, the more anxious it makes people to own a copy. (See the circulation of the National Enquirer.) I'm happy I bought this book. I think if the Masons weren't SO caught up in being hush-hush, the thrill of uncovering secrets would disappear. And why would they hide things if they did everything on the up-and-up and were so upstanding? Makes me believe every word in this book."
1,less than one star,I should have read the reviews. The time span for life of this product is about a month. I gave one to my mother for Christmas and it is already dead. Will not heat. I would give it less than one star.
2,are you kidding me?,"I was very disappointed by this movie. Granted that it is difficult to squeeze the entire time span of the book in a two hour film, the editing was way too choppy for a viewer who has never read the book to fully understand the full scope of the characters and the situations. Not only did they eliminated Nelly - the main narrator, they also eliminated critical scenes from the book, which would explain why Heathcliff came to be the tormented soul we know. The 2 adult lead characters enacting events that happen during their childhoods from the book is just comical. The actor who portrayed Heathcliff was intense but much too old to play the part. Orla Brady was good as Catherine, but not good enough to rescue this movie."
1,"diluted, painful garbage","...the novel is a passionate work, with characters who probe the extremes of human feeling. the novel contains beautiful funny bits and pretty scene descriptions to leaven its blackness. the novel is a masterwork. this film takes the vibrant heathcliff and twists him into a snivelling, ratlike fellow, reminiscent of the baker from sondheim's Into the Woods. this film reduces cathy's strong nature and harsh mercuriality to overemotional slosh. this film's dialogue and sets are singularly dreary. this film takes the comic, hemming joseph and the sensible, well-balanced mrs. dean and cuts them into non-characters. this film is devoid of all life. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR YOUR TIME."
4,Good version of the book,"Both my teenage daughters had to read Wuthering Heights at school, so I reviewed all the versions of the movie and bought this one on the basis that it was consistently rated as being closest to the movie. I know the book well, and was very pleased with the authenticity and with how close the movie matched the book. It helped my daughters understand a difficult novel too. Worth buying."
1,Not what I ordered,"The product I received was a snap case, though the product listing says it's a keep case. Obviously that's not normally a big deal, but I don't like snap cases and specifically ordered the keep case packaging for that reason."
3,"Clever, silly comedy","Clever, silly comedy about a hit man, Jimmy (The Tulip) Tudeski, who moves in next door to a dentist (Matthew Perry) in suburban Montreal. Bruce Willis stars as Jimmy, and he is good as the nice-but-tough killer. Perry, although very similar to his Chandler character from `Friends', displays a nice touch of physical comedy; his character seems actually that nice that the bizarre events in this film are actually happening to him. Amanda Peet and Natasha Henstridge are beautiful and Peet is very funny as Perry's dental assistant, Michael Clarke Duncan is terrific as Frankie Figgs, enforcer, and Rosanna Arquette displays a terrific French-Canadian accent as Perry's miserable wife. The only bad acting: the usually hilarious Kevin Pollak as a Hungarian crime lord with pronunciation problems (maybe's there's a Keyser Soze reference in there somewhere?) Also, nice Montreal scenery and a good jazzy score. Here's a prediction: Amanda Peet will have a successful film career."
2,Cute but not Great!,"I would not recommend buying this DVD or driving yourself crazy to find it. But if its a rainy day and you want to see a cute movie The Whole Nine Yards is a decent pick.The movie is not super funny like some of the directors other works like My Cousin Vinny or the film he did with Jeff Daniels and Kramer.Probably the best thing in the film is Amanda Peet.The movie has a couple of funny parts and some good actors but this is far from a must see film.Rent it, don't buy it."
4,A sleeper of a movie,"Yes, it's a little formulaic, but who can agrue with a line like: ""You know, I can't think of nothing finer than a fine naked woman holding a gun."" and then show you a visual confirmation. Drink beer while you watch this movie."
4,Great Mob Comedy,"About a hitman named Jimmy ""The Tulip"" Tudeski(Bruce Willis) who moves next door to an unhappily married dentist(Matthew Perry). His arrival brings about many wacky occurences, and I must say they were extremely hillarious. The DVD is presented in full screen or widescreen. It also has a nice Dolby 5.1 sound mix, although this isn't one of those movies that sound is important in. The DVD has some cool features such as a feature-length audio commentary with director Jonathan Lynn, an interview gallery with the cast, a trailer, filmographies, and some nifty interactive menus. Very funny movie that I highly recommend to those looking for a good laugh."
3,"Funny, but not Hilarious!","This movie was kind of disappointing for me I really expected alot, and maybe that was my problem. Despite all this Matthew Perry and Bruce Willis provide enough laughs to make it worth renting."
2,Rent before you buy,"This is one of those films that you have to rent before you buy. The movie would have gotten three stars if they had not made a few bad casting decisions.Perry's character should have been named Chandler. He should just stick to Friends. When the show goes off the air he should too. It's one thing to be type-cast, but it's another to only be able to play one character regardless of what the script calls for. He made this film painful to watch.Arquette's character was also incredibly annoying in this film. Her accent was enough to make you want to mute the scenes that she was in.On a brighter note, the hitmen were all very well cast and were the only thing that saved this movie from a single star rating. Peet's character was great - very sexy and very funny. Pollack's character was wery vonderful."
2,Silly movie,"George Clooney plays a divorce lawyer who always goes for the jugular in his clients' settlements. Catherine Zeta-Jones is a gold-digger who is building her fortune by marrying and divorcing wealthy men. Inevitably they meet when Clooney is representing Zeta-Jones's husband in a divorce. Clooney manages to keep her from getting any of her husband's money and she vows to get revenge. There is a harum-scarum plot with an asthmatic hit man, a Scottish wedding, and various pre-nuptual agreements which usually end up in tatters on the floor. This is a pretty silly movie and the only surprising part is that two stars of this magnitude would let themselves be persuaded to be a part of it."
3,Tolerable Comedy,"This is not one of the Coen Brothers' stronger efforts, but it's still watchable. The storyline is more predictable than in most of their movies, although there are a few twists along the way. Only two scenes - the courtroom sequence and the showdown with Wheezy Joe - reach the inspired level of warped humor that is the Coens' hallmark. And Miles' speech to the NOMAN convention is a complete waste of time.The cast members all do a decent job. Clooney is charming; Zeta-Jones is gorgeous; Herrmann, Rush, Cedric and Thornton all come through with workmanlike performances. But for the most part, there's little ""zing"" and you don't really care much about the outcome.I went back and forth between three stars and four on this. I really wish Amazon allowed half-star ratings, so I could give it 3.5 stars."
2,Not One of my favorite Coen Brothers Films,"Clooney and Zeta-Jones were fine, but the plot was too complex and too many actors made the film hard to focus on."
1,Boring,"The movie has a very simple story, there was nothing exciting to it. I was very disappointment at it, I love George Clooney and Catherine Zeta Jones. But this is the worse movie that I have seen. I thought they could have done better. As you sat there, you would keep thinking when will this end ? Is there point to this ? This movie is for people probably in their early twenties. But if you are in the 30's and up , you will hate it."
1,one of the worst movies i have ever seen,"i love george clooney and catherine zeta-jones, but they really embarassed themselves with this film. i was bored to tears and kept looking at my watch praying for it to end. incredibly corny and predictable, and only a few lines made me smile. a very good cast wasted on such a bad film. do not waste your money."
2,Intolerable Movie,What happened? Good cast give it their all only to have all the humor incinerated by the director. And the camera work was atrocious too!
4,Entertainng bit of nonsense,"This comedy is full of twists and turns. Just the sight of the two main characters, George Clooney and Catherine Zeta-Jones, makes the movie enjoyable. I wonder what other scripts the Coen brothers produced!"
3,Gold-digging in 2003,"One problem is that this plot theme was already about 3,000 years old in 1933, 1935, and 1937, but there were lots better songs and dance numbers in the movies of those days. Yes, we know that some pretty girls and women plot, connive and hustle for money. One of the words used in the special feature was ""mainstream"", and that's what this idea is: mainstream, almost tv sit-com. And what looks like a lot of hard script work and heavy mugging can't save it. Eight years in the making! Not surprising it looks a trifle tired. It starts promisingly, and it's reasonably watchable all the way through, but at the end you think: what were the Coens trying to do? Dig up a little more gold from a well-mined seam? Hollywood seems to believe that it worked before, so it'll work again, with a younger generation, but there's no substitute for originality in art. This film needed another Busby Berkeley. Perhaps the Dude should have been called in for a spot of laid-back hoofing."
1,Boring,"What a boring movie! With two actors like Clooney and Zeta-Jones I certainly expected more. This was the worst movie I've seen in a long, long time."
3,Stop Now,Ok I hope this reaches you in time I am not rating this album bad I am simply pointing out that a new better remasterd copy is now available with a kick ass bonus track I dont see it here yet however I do know it is available on the meniketti websitehttp://www.meniketti.com! The New Master is Awesome !!!
5,Black Tiger,"Y&T has been rocking hard for a good while, love the title track man what a Jam...Mr Manichetti is a beast on lead"
1,no lo compre,"es una porquería de disco, yo lo tengo y al que quiera se lo regalo, no he soportado una audición completa"
4,Great for storing Ice Cream,"Bought these based on the reviews and they're doing great. I utilize them to share my ice cream creations with family members so I wouldn't be heart broken if I didn't get the containers back, but so far they always find a way back to me. I've washed them 4-5 times in the dishwasher (a couple times on the lower level, a typical no-no for plastic tupperware but my boyfriend seems to never remember this) and they're still in good condition. I'm not giving them a 5 star just because I figured the lids would be a little more substantial- not a biggie, they work great, I just am worried they may get morphed over time. I will update if they do. Definitely a good purchase!"
3,"Flimsy lids, but ok for my needs","I purchased these with the intention of storing sugar packets in them, without the lids, for our coffee station at work. That being said, the lids were pretty darn thin and flimsy, and I would probably return these if I were going to actually use the container with lids. They work perfectly for what I had in mind, but beware if you are looking for quality food storage."
3,Flowers for Molly,"A great performance by Shue does not overshadow the fact that we have seen this story before. Flowers for Algernon and Charly were the original stories from the 60's. This a modern take on the stories, but if you've seen or read the previous stories you know the outcome. This is a good drama to rent but I would not buy it."
5,Crochet with Ease...this book is great!,"I have never picked up so much as a sewing needle, but when someone turned me on to this book I made two of the Afghans and they turned out great. It was so easy...I loved it because of the beautiful pictures and easy to follow instructions. A must get for someone who loves to Crochet, or someone like me who is just starting out!"
4,"Contains selection from ""The Bishop's Wife""","Heavenly sacred choral music, without a doubt.The selection, Track No. 8, ""Nol, for soprano, alto, female chorus & piano with organ..."", is a recording of the piece performed in the movie ""The Bishop's Wife"" (1947). We hear the Mitchell Boychoir actually sing it in rehearsal for the angel, Dudley (Cary Grant) and the film's namesake, Julia (Loretta Young).The Bishop's WifeA lovely piece of music, well-performed and preserved within a cherished Christmas movie classic.It would be nice if this particular audio CD recording were made available again."
4,Informative,This was a real exciting movie about the history and culture of Moto GP. It contained excelent interactive scenes from races of the 2001-2004 Moto GP seasons. It gave a clear insight of what it takes to be and stay a Moto GP racer and that its not all easy as it seems. Anyone who wants to learn about this grand and dangerous sport should buy and watch this DVD.
5,Everything you hoped it would be.,"If you're into motorcycle roadracing and haven't been living under a rock, then you've heard about ""Faster"" by now. It naturally draws all of the inevitable comparisons to the immortal ""On Any Sunday,"" though its singular focus, effective editing, and engrossing backstory development make this the definitive roadracing movie. Like O.A.S., it has a beautiful knack of presenting the material in a manner that both interests and educates those with little prior knowledge of the subject while still including everything necessary to keep the most hardcore roadracing afficionado hooked. If you're reading this review, then you already want it. I'm here to tell you to cough up the cash and buy a copy. You won't be dissappointed.See you at Seca in July!!!- CC Hausman"
3,MotoGP races are shorted than this movie,"I liked this but it seemed to run long. As much as I love MotoGP I just could not watch this in one sitting. Photography is pretty good. Like to rate it higher, but I hit the pause button on it too much to do that."
4,Boundary Layer Theory,Good value - well worth the money. I also like the updated sections available in the Springer edition.
2,Not Really Box Bottom,"Perhaps I'm expecting too much, but I'd really expected better from Pendaflex. Calling these folders ""box bottom"" is, at best, misleading. The bottoms offer no support whatsoever and the cardboard reinforcement strips they give you are totally worthless. End result is that the bottoms sag enough that the folders drag on the bottom of the drawer."
2,Never Gets There,"The story, acting and plot were, in a word, stilted. Everything seemed very predictable. First, we have a little girl who couldn't possibly be evil..or could she? Then, the social worker who is the archetype defender of the weak who can't be shaken...or can she? Then, the best friend who, by definition of best friend, is doomed. And the abrasive, but heroic, cop friend....can you say 'next'? It just felt like an equation with no real surprise and easy to solve.The little girl's character, however, is creepy. Not much of a stilt to support the weight of a bad movie. Even so, it gets two stars because, did I mention...the kid's creepy."
3,Seriously? The little girl is the bad guy?,"A smarmy, self righteous, despicable social worker abducts a little girl from her home and murders her. Which if you check the headlines is not so far fetched. More likely the child would have been peddled to a judge, senator, white house staffer, or foreign diplomat in the white slave trade. On the bright side the psychologist and the cop got smoked. So not an entirely bad movie."
3,Very Creepy Kid - B-,"An overworked Social Worker (Zellweger) picks up a case involving a little girl (Ferland) being abused by her parents. Emily (Zellweger) pulls strings and adopts Lilly (Ferland) in order to help her. There are very few things that scare me in movies. The biggest one is creepy kids, which this movie has. After a vicious attack by her parents Lilly finds a new loving home with Emily. After strange happenings Emily begins to wonder how crazy Emily's parents were. The little girl (Ferland) does a fantastic job of creeping me out. This movie runs along the line of being believable and far fetched...playing both sides makes it even creeper then if if stayed on one side of the fence or the other. Nothing outstanding but creepy enough to have to watch with the lights on. I give it a B-."
2,Good Movie Until The End,"Warning Spoiler Alert.Good creepy horror movie with a crummy ending. Completely unplausable. The child - Lilth.... reminded me a little of the girl in The Ring. Prepare to be royally creeped out!The Bad: is the ending... You are NOT left wondering whats next. You already know Renee's life is over. Lilith is dead at her hands and no matter how she tries to justfy it she'll be in jail for the rest of her life. Nothing is left to your imagination. Great movie, weak ending."
2,Not Impressed,"Sure the acting and the direction are adequate (Robson Green is a charismatic screen presence) -- certainly a cut above most American TV crime fare. Alas, the story lines in this series are so contrived and improbable that they completely dispell the illusion of close-to-the-bone realism this show tries to project. I watched 3 installments of this series and each time I was struck by the lack of authenticity in the characters, their motivations, actions (and reactions)-- beneath the ""gritty"" veneer, these characters are paper-thin and implausible (particularly the criminals). Creeghan's tendancy to vigilantism is disturbing, yet fails to convince (I mean the guy's a walking liability, a loose cannon obviously in need of psych-leave) The whole production emits a subtle, yet palpable air of manipulation, sensationalism & pretense. Want to see a truly gritty -- and thoroughly human -- British crime series? Watch ""Prime Suspect"" and skip these."
1,Pecked to death by ducks,I was quite disappointed in this book. Cahill has written outstanding material but this collection seems to be a gathering of miscellaneous leftovers. I was led to this book after reading A Walk in the Woods by Bryson - and it was a false lead. The quality is not there.
5,Insights into the our world and ourselves,"""A Theory of Power"" explores the roles of patterns, especially the pattern of hierarchy, in our biology, psychology and society. One of its critical insights is the profoundly original theory that the ego serves as a link between our biology of ""selfish genes"" and our society of ""selfish memes"". I found this book insightful, not only helping me to better understand how I fit into the structure of the world around me (not to mention what ""I"" really am), but because Vail provides a clear course of action--not only to free our individual self from the control of biology and culture, but also to confront the pattern of hierarchy directly in our society and economy. A fascinating read that I highly recommend."
2,Too small,"These burp cloths are attractive which was why I chose them, but they are impractical for their purpose. They are too small and fall off my shoulder when I drape them to burp my daughter. I would opt for something larger."
5,learning to read,"We're teaching our daughter to read, and it was really difficult to illustrate that ""top"" is the same as ""stop"" just with an extra letter added on the front. These tiles are perfect for that, since we can arrange and re-arrange them, and she gets to participate in the process and sound out the different parts of the word and then join them together. There's a great variety of letters so we're not sorting around to find a ""b"" or an ""r"" and we store them in a little plastic container when not in use. Love these."
2,"Ann Rule: More blah, blah, blah","You read one Ann Rule, then you've just about read them all. I find her books shallow, disconnected, biased, repetitive, and pages filled with useless information. Who cares about all this detail of these people's lives? We already know they're dysfunctional human beings who play on the emotions of others, so why go on and on about their history, love affairs, failed marriages, etc. Rule's books read more like the National Enquirer rather than true crime. This one is the last one I'll read of Ann Rules."
1,Frustration express!,"As a family, we have enjoyed simple marble towers before, and I liked the thought of putting our older children to the test. Unfortunately, this toy only tests your frustration level. The pieces are too loose, and come apart far too easily. This toy is a waste of money, space (large box), and time. DO NOT BUY!"
2,First Wallace was NEVER called Braveheart,"That was Robert the Bruce who was indeed an intensely religious man. (James Douglas, who carried the Bruce's heart on crusade. is said to have first uttered the words as Douglas was cut down in battle: ""Lead on, Brave Heart, and Douglas will follow."")There is little evidence in the least that William Wallace was an intensely religious man although he did try (with poor results) to save churches in England from being looted. He did a poor job of controlling his men. Wallace was a brave man, a hero and a martyr for Scottish freedom. Unfortunate, this and the horrible movie by Gibson tell more lies than any truth about Scottish history and the gallant men who fought for Scotland.I wish I could recommend a good novel about Wallace. Unfortunately, I can't. I don't know of one."
5,"If you liked the movie ""Brave Heart,"" this tells the rest...","If you want action, romance, intrigue, mystery, suspense, history, honor and character, ""The Scottish Chiefs"" has it all and is definitely a book you can't put down. It takes a (short) chapter or two to get into the story and eloquent language, but then you'll be hooked. I truly think that this book should replace the ""Red Badge of Courage"" and several other books as required reading in U.S. schools...rb"
4,Christmas present,"I gave this hat to my dad, he loves the brand so I wanted to give him something I knew he could use all the time. It was perfect. Amazons service was perfect too, I thought it would not be here before Christmas but it was like four days before the date. *I was very careful with the size and it worked perfectly."
4,"hat is good, shipping was great","The shipment was very quick, and since I am living overseas, I never know what to expect. The hat itself is okay. It is a little flimsy/floppier that I expected. but it seems to be of good quality. I like the style of it, and will probably order another one (lighter weight) for this summer. It's nice to have something besides a baseball cap to wear!"
3,Just okay,"I expected higher quality for this brand and price. Also, the Dusty Teal is on the greenish or turquoise side, not the deep grayish denim color I saw on my monitor.Having said that, every hip bald guy needs a Kangol cap!"
5,fantastic cap,"I have two of these. Unfortunately, my older model is a bit snug so I had to order another. The size medium that I ordered was so much larger than the small that I already owned that I returned it and purchased another small version, and it is perfect--just a bit larger than the older 'small' model than I already own (which doesn't really fit my head). This newer model 504 (""designed in Great Britain, made in China"") is a bit larger and has a lower quality headband than does my older version (""made in Great Britain"") and has the Kangol logo on the back of the cap, with better labeling on the inside of the cap. Otherwise, they both have the same Kangol quality. Great for guys with short hair on cold days. I bought this from Amazon, shipped from shoebuy.com and it came within 1 or 2 days max. I'll order from them again."
2,"Little content, lots of cliche","I really enjoyed ""The Purpose Driven Life,"" so I was excited when I found out that our small group would be going through this other Rick Warren book.I was quite disappointed, though, to find out what the book's content was really like. The general idea of the book is to go through each of the fruit of the spirit, in a practical way. Rick provides a few (4-7) points for each fruit, of practical ways to grow in those areas. So far, so good.The frustrating part was that I really felt like some manager or publisher told him, ""The book isn't long enough, add a lot of padding."" Each point has about one paragraph of depth to it, and about 3-6 paragraphs of cheesy cliches and anecdotes.For our small group, it ended up working out ok, because it provided a starting point, from which we provided our own depth of discussion from our own lives. But the book itself was not one that I would highly recommend, especially after the high quality of Rick Warren's more popular book."
5,Very Inspiring & Thought Provoking,"I started reading this book, and had a very difficult time setting it down. I underlined many areas, and probably could have underlined the entire book! I was amazed at how each section seem to apply to my life and my husband's. I'm looking forward to reading another book by Rick Warren. I was told to readThe Purpose of Christmasby Rick Warren. If you are looking for some direction, or just want to improve your life and the ones around you, this is a wonderful book!"
2,For BN Fans Only,"I keep searching through Bill Nelson's more recent releases and I keep trying to find more of the sound that I loved on ""The Love That Whirls..."", ""Chimera"", and even the ""Vistamix"" album, and I keep coming up empty. Those albums contained some amazing works of genious and some beautiful, sublime, pop. On ""Blue Moons"" only ""Ancient Guitars"" and ""Spinning Around"" pique my interest. If you liked ""Flaming Desire"" and ""Acceleration"", you'll like those tracks, otherwise, I'd recommend you stay away."
3,OK Sheets,"OK overall product. The one pillowcase came with a small spot of unraveling along a seam. Nice for the price I paid, you get what you pay for."
4,"Yes, they are satin","The previous reviewer, who said these are not satin, clearly does not understand what satin is. Satin is not a fiber but a type of weave. It can be made of most any material, polyester, silk, rayon, ext."
2,No No No - Not even worth THIS low price....,"granted - bought these because a) had never had 'silk sheets' before, and b) the under $15 price was unbeatable.....then. folks, use your money to buy more expensive sheets: these do NOT fit regular mattress corners and you will need to 're-tuck' in at those corners every morning. add to that are that even SLIGHTLY rough skin will shred through the sheets themselves; they won't make actual holes...more like when women get those 'runs' in their stockings type of deal. to finish it off, you will slide ALL over the place ALL the time....."
1,don't buy,"Even for just $30, this was a complete waste of money. They aren't soft, they are harsh. On top of that, they are super-thin. These are nothing like satin and definitely not luxurious. We've only used them once; I hope to return them. Don't waste your time."
1,Extremely Poor Quality,"Don't waste your money. You get what you pay for. On the flat sheet, the seams were ""missed"" in many places and were fraying! There were also places on the flat sheet that looked ""picked"", like someone had pulled the sheet over something sharp. These sheets also did not feel a bit like ""satin"", more like FINE GRIT SANDPAPER. I returned these extremely poor quality sheets and will spend more to buy something I can see and feel that is of good quality!"
2,Nice to look at but lousy in bed,"Wayyyyyyyy too slippery. They live up to the promise of satiny smooth, but overly so. It's like sleeping in silicon covered sheets. Everything, including you, slides off the top of the bed. This was an inexpensive way to see if this type of sheet is for us - and it's not."
2,False advertising,"These are great if you want to make a big impact for a holiday or a birthday, but the are NOT satin, and the reverse side is actually quite uncomfortable, so once you get inside the sheets, it is a bit of a letdown. However, it does make a huge impression, so if you buy at a very low cost and anticipate throwing them away after three washes, they are fun."
4,Nail converter,"This is the kit you need to convert the stapler to a nailer, very easy to change. The Bostitch nailer is a nice unit although it does not have th face nailing option for tight spots by the wall."
4,"Good, but not Moore's best work","First off, I did love this book. Everything I liked about it has probably already been said below, so I'll skip the good stuff. Rest assured, there's lots of it.In the not-so-good column I'd include some of Moore's characterization. I can't say too much without including spoilers, but if you do read Watchmen, pay attention to Doc Manhattan. I felt like Moore's depiction of him was not well thought out.Also worth mentioning is that a couple of times in this book Moore gives in to the temptation to follow a certain structure even when it isn't best for the story. He comes up with a cool idea, but won't let it go even after it becomes played. This hampers the story's readability.But hey, if that's all that's not great about it, it's probably worth a look, eh?"
5,"One of only two comics I own,(besides Harvey Pekar's stuff).","I'm a grey-reality-comic fan. Watchmen, and The Dark Knight Returns are surely not in this category, but they include enough soul-serching and negativity to reach me."
5,If you only read one graphic novel in your entire lifetime...,It must be this one novel. This masterpiece is proof that comic books can indeed be literature.
4,A dark look at a dark story,"This was an interesting read. I was really into it in the beginning, then the middle part got a little wierd for me and then the ending was good. The art in the book was appealing and the intial storyline was intruigung. the story is a bit dated in my opinion with a lot of worry in the era of the cold war. it doesnt take much extrapolation though for this to harken to today's polical climate where terrorism is in the foreground. fans of graphic novels should pick this one up. it'll keep you busy for awhile."
2,Not worth it!!,"I've never been a comic book reader and just because they have changed the name to graphic novel doesn't impress me much either. But a friend brought in Watchmen and asked me to read it and give my opinion. I finished the ""book"" this morning and from first to last I thought it was dreary. The only characters I really liked were the two Nite Owl men and Rorchach. Not one other character showed the least bit of humanity or even a pleasant personality. The story was just depressing and it took all my will to finish the darned thing. The only part I actually enjoyed were the in-between chapters. That is why this review has two stars and not just one. Those I really enjoyed especially Hollis Mason's Under the Hood excerpts. They were excellent and didn't need illustrations to tell a good story. I'm not quite sure why Time Magazine declared Watchmen one of the ""100 Best Novels since 1923"" It isn't."
4,Awsome,"This comic is absolutely amazing !! I wish I could have it in realLife that would be amazing, a dream come true !!!"
2,Not good for electronic devices.,"Awesome novel. Much better on paper, though. Having to rely on a small screen really doesn't do the comic the justice it deserves."
5,Watchmen,"This book was a gift for my grandson's 14th birthday. He was thrilled. He had wanted this book for quite awhile, but it was $40 at the bookstore. When I saw what a great price Amazon had, I got it immediately. Anyone who reads, collects comic books or is just a fan of Watchmen will want to add this book to their collection. The graphics are beautiful & the cover was as nice as the $40 edition."
3,Flaws & All,"What I really liked about this story was that a majority of the characters don't have any ""super powers"" beyond their own will. They're a group of very flawed people forcing their interpretation of the law on others for various reasons beyond simple ""justice"".The twist at the end was pretty nice and reminded me of an old science fiction short story I read years ago about an astronaut stranded in orbit. I won't say anymore otherwise I might give away the twist for those who've not read it.I'm really looking forward the movie now. ;)"
5,The greatest comic story ever told.,"Anyone looking for a good read will be floored by Alan Moore's 12-issue classic, Watchmen. In this maxiseries, we are shown a world rife with Cold War paranoia, moral decay, superheroes, conspiracies, and Nixon. It starts off with the mad rantings of a half-insane and fascistic hero, Rorschach, who is trying to solve a mystery of a murdered superhero. Although he is beyond creepy (issue 6 almost will make you pity criminals), the scary part is, most of his theories are accurate.From the spineless Dan Dreiberg, to the robotic Dr. Manhattan, this is a story of complex characters, Machiavellian schemes, and a world not too different from our own. Even non-comic fans will enjoy."
1,Kindle Fire Edition - Avoid!,"I got the Kindle Fire edition (which isn't allowing reviews, as it doesn't think the book has been released yet). The panels are too small to read on the Fire (would be fine on the iPad or even most netbooks or PC's, but you can't download the book there, or to a generic Android tablet). Worst of all, the individual panels repeat a random number of times, anywhere from 3-9 in a row (this may be tied to the number of individual content boxes on a page, but only loosely).Avoid this as an ebook until there is a larger device it can be read and the repeat issue is corrected (if it showed one box/page, that might solve both)."
1,A Warning would have been nice... (Kindle Edition),"I purchased this book to read on my Kindle app...Well, they shouldn't even offer it for digital, because the text is too small to read...Portrait, Landscape...It doesn't matter. I tried everything. So then I thought, well I will read it on my PC Kindle Reader...BUZzZzZz..>Wrong Answer<...It's not available for the PC reader...So now I paid for the book that I have no way to read...Lovely."
2,"Maybe historically interesting, but....","I recently read ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" and enjoyed it quite a bit, so I decided to read ""Watchmen"" after all the rave comments I had been reading.What a disappointment.My biggest complaint is that the story was just plain boring. There are 12 issues, and I couldn't get into it until issue 10. It made some interesting points at times, but all the material is covered better somewhere else (like Claremont/Byrne X-Men, or Marvels, or any of the Busiek/Perez Avengers).I also had a very hard time getting past the humourlessness and lack of any heroic/inspiring material. And sadly, the moral conclusion is WAAAAY off. Great violence leads to more violence - not universal peace. The whole thing left a very bad taste in mouth since the World Trade Center attack."
1,Bleh.,"I hated this book with a heated passion. Some of my classmates loved it, but I would have rather burned it."
5,Awesome book,"I used to be big into comic books when I was a kid, then I saw that this graphic novel made the ""top 100 novels of the 20th century"" I decided to check it out. The story was awesome, the art was good but felt dated. I heard they're currently working on a movie version, I can't see how you could possibly capture the same feeling in a movie. In all - awesome read whether or not you're into comic books or graphic novels."
2,I don't get the hype at all,"I don't get the hype. It's a decent enough book, but I just don't see what's so special about it."
4,Dated but still relevent,"The only graphic novel on the list of 1001 books you should read in your lifetime, Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' Watchmen is an interesting deconstruction of the superhero mythos. The story is a little dated, as the original 12 issues were published in the late 80s and deal with more Cold War issues such as the constant immanent threat of nuclear war, but many of the questions raised would still be relevant today. It is also a study into what it takes to be a hero, and the lengths that one hero would go to to ensure world peace.The art is a little sparse, but it fits for the tone and feel of the story. Told in a more cinematic style, you should pay attention to the panel flow and the stories in the story to find hidden correlations in the story.Overall, even with the slightly dated material, it is an amazingly well thought out story, both in dialogue and the visual aspect of the story."
5,Absolutely Incredible,Probably the finest piece of literature in this genre and it is rumored that they will make a motion picture of it.I can't wait.TJ
5,Compelling,"Being new to the graphic novel genre, I focused more heavily on the words than the images. The story is compelling, dark and very well written. The images enhance the message and help give ""life"" to the words. An excellent read whether you are a super hero fan or a fan of top flight literature that happens to be about super heroes."
4,Works fine,"This foam roller works perfectly for what I need it for, I stretch out my calves on it and it is great."
2,Flush free products are not as effective.,"After finding out about the flush free products, I tried them. It has no effect on wellness. I take the supplement in the winter time and 500mg in the morning and 500mg at night. It can actually save you money on your heating bill it activates the circulation and you feel warmer all the time. The flush feeling is not that bad and if it is a bother, than reduce the dosage by cutting the tablet in half."
5,This is a great pinball game,"I bought this pinball game and theCurious George Pin Ballfor our two sons.Both of these are metal backed and high quality. We've not used them long, but they appear to be able to last significantly longer than the plastic pinball games we've received in the past.Best of all, this game is huge! It is more the kind of thing you would hold in your lap than something for your hand. The kids really seem to enjoy this old school kind of activity as an alternative to today's phones and tablets."
3,"Spanish in a Week, I don't think so.","I guess it is a good CD and guide book. I learnt a few phrases, but I can't speak Spanish."
1,The title says it all,"This movie is on the level of a badly written sit-com. There is not one original idea in it. Every gag is telegraphed from a mile away. Every character is a cartoon cut-out and there is nothing even approaching a real performance. It's pretty clear that the actors involved knew they were turning out schlock and were only in it for a paycheck. I have liked John Larroquette in many other things, but even he doesn't seem at all invested in this. I sat through about 30-40 minutes of this nonsense before I decided it wasn't worth any more of my time. If you are looking in your local video store for a good comedy and you happen across this wretched excuse for a movie, do yourself a favor and rent whatever's next to it. It's bound to be better."
1,Recipe for Stupidity,"This brain-less, un-funny ""comedy"" is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Absolutely atrocious. Idiotic acting, annoying characters, dumb screenplay and the most stupid plot ever conceived in film history, this is one film that will most certainly be shown on Mystery Science Theater 3000, if the show is ever resurrected. For now, avoid this pile of crap at all costs."
5,My mini lives on!,My ipod mini died a few months back. I thought that I'd have to get a new one and lose all the songs I had on it until I stumbled upon Sonnett's replacement batteries. My mini works fine now and I still have all my songs.This kit comes with all the tools you'll need (other than a standard hair dryer) as well as a CD of really thorough quicktime movies that show you how to actually do the installation. I use my mini so much that I imagine I'll be getting another one of these batteries eventually.
2,One Of Grisham's Worst,"UGGGGGGG!!!Back when John Grisham was new, he was hip, exciting, and wrote some very good books.This is not one of those books.Working on an unrealistic timetable where he was putting out a new book every year, 'The Street Lawyer' feels like it was totally rushed out the door. The story is basic: a chance encounter with a homeless man turns a hard-nosed 100 hour a week lawyer into an individual who ends up doing pro bono work for the poor. The writing is trite and old, the story unrealistic more so than usual, and the further I got along through this book, the more I felt the arm of the publisher telling Grisham to get ANYTHING on the shelves as soon as possible.I recommend this book only for the biggest of Grisham fans who have to read EVERYTHING that he puts out.** NOT RECOMMENDED"
3,Bearable.,The Street Lawyer was averagely fair. The plots were easy to follow and easy to predict. Worth to read it.
3,Not the best of Grisham by any means.,"Our Writer's Guild decided a few months back to discuss current fiction works by best selling authors. Grisham's new novel was rated poorly as it was slow moving and absolutely boring at times. I had the misfortune of selecting Clancy's new book for review. I can't tell you what a let down it was. The characters are weak, redundant, and have too much irrelevant background information. Not one of seven writers who reviewed these books liked it. I also agree with the reviewer from Denver who read Brad Steiger's new book, Alien Rapture. It's the talk of our fiction group and is a gripping fast read with characters you'll never forget. Also The Notebook is excellent. Also see 'No Safe Place' by Patterson and 'Seeker' by Frazier."
3,Had to be done John?,"I read this book several months ago and, with enough distance since the disappointment, I think that he needed to write a social statement. I am hoping that since it's out of his system, THE TESTAMENT will take us back to his old style of writing - the style that worked for me. I vaguely remember the characters and vaguely remember the plot. I remember it being an OK read, nothing I have recommended to anyone. I was disappointed that it wasn't more typical of Grisham's style, but I think now upon retrospect, he needed to do this."
4,Technology in law firms?,"I thought this was a pretty good read, however I wonder aren't there other avenues for copying the document than the copy machine that lawyers can never use because every copy is billed to someone, how about a fax machine(?) or a scanner (!), or the computer file itself? I think most lawyers would know that leaving with the file was his big problem. I've read all the Grisham books and I liked this one, too."
3,Flows along nicely but not too exciting,"I have to start my review by saying that I am a huge fan of Grisham's. I have read and like every one of his books but feel that lately he is just churning them out as it is expected of him. Where books like The Chamber and A Time To Kill (even The Firm) had a story line that made you turn the page and wouldn't let you put them down, this book and his previous book are merely an interesting story which is a good read but nothing much else. I liked the story but it wasn't a Grisham book - not the kind we all know and love."
3,Obviously not the best,It makes you think of homeless (but only for 1 day- and that's the time enough to read it). That's all! Hope they don't make a movie of it...
2,You've come undone.,"Mr. Grisham appears to have had a need to write, but not to put time into development as he has in his past novels. I read this sorry latest out of loyalty to the genre of Grisham past. The loyalty remains, but questions abound. Is this a pattern Mr. Grisham, of having lost the creative urge and the Gift or just pressure from your publisher? Come back J.G., you are sorely missed."
1,The worst Grisham ever!,"This book is so bad, you wonder if Grisham really wrote it, or he got someone else to write it for him. Ok, so its a great pitch for the homeless people. So it belongs in the sociology section. Certainly not the thrilling pageturner that you've come to expect from John Grisham - it doesnt even have a story. At the best of times, it is boring, for a John Grisham fan who wants to maintain his respect for the author - it is an absolute no-no!"
2,A dissapointing effort from an otherwise excellent author,"John Grisham is concerned about homelessness and poverty in America. He is disgusted by lawyers and others with wealth who do little to help them. This point is made abundantly clear in the first 50 pages. Yet, the entire book serves as a platform for Grisham to wax on endlessly about these, admittedly, serious problems. The book has no fluid motion. He weaves together several flat story lines, all of which end in a climax both dull and too neat. The story isn't well developed, and neither are most of the characters (save Mordeci Green). If he spent a little less time trying to prove how bad homelessness is and devoted it to story and character development, this might be a worthwhile effort. Save your money...and if you are new to Grisham, try ""The Runaway Jury"" or ""A Time To Kill"" for some of his better stuff."
2,Thought-provoking but too much details,"This is the second novel I've read by Grisham and this one was not a page-turner at all. Pages and pages of details that could've been omitted . . . the only thing that did was to make you think about the plight of homeless people. The Partner, on the contrary, was a much better novel. . . better storyline and better plot at a much faster pace. You won't wanna sleep until you're at the last page. I recommend that one instead."
2,A quasi fictional mess,The problem with this book is that it reaches it's peak interest too soon in the very first chapter and from then on it's all downhill. One just keeps hoping that there will be glimpses of the usual Grisham brilliance in the latter parts of the book but only to be let down again and again without any pity. This book really reads like a political commentary on the plight of the homeless with some characters created just to further torture the reader. My personal opinion is that Grisham would have been much better off writing a non-fictional book on this topic intead of creating this quasi-fictional mess.
3,"5 stars at the beggining, 1 star at the end","This book starts out with a bang. It becomes, however, more boring as the book goes on. The exciting introduction sets a great foundation for an exciting novel. HOwever, after the introduction, it is all down hill from there. IT becomes boring and unrealistic. It seems as if Grisham is tryin to make a good novel and also portray the lives of the homeless. This however, is very hard to do. Grisham trades the excitement and suspense of his earlier novels for a chilling realization of homeless life. It is my personal opinion that the trade was for the worse. I thought this novel could have been much better if there had been more of an emphasis on suspense and excitement rather than that of a homeless informant."
1,About as exciting as the vomit bag,"I got this from the library (thankfully) for a flight. The delightful stick figures on the flight safety brochure had much more personality than the characters in this terrible book. I like most of Grisham's books, but this was awfully written, and the main character was a pompous idiot (probably not a good idea to write in the first person, so we can see how shallow and misguided he is). Anyway, avoid this at all costs, but if you happen to read it on a plane, insist on as many free drinks as possible; it could either make the book tolerable, or maybe help you forget this schlock."
2,WHAT A WASTE OF TIME,AUTHOR SHOULD WRITE AN ARTICLE ON THE HOMELESS AND NOT MASQUERADE THIS AS A THRILLER.
2,The book is too steeped in social conciousness,"John Grisham has written several great stories. The Street Lawyer attempts to educate its readers on the plight of the homeless. Yes this is a major issue in our country, but the story does not hold the readers interest. If you really want a great thriller that has homelessness as a theme I would recommend, The Intruder by Peter Blauner. Mr. Grisham you could take a lesson from this author."
3,"An enjoyable read, but lacking some of the intesity of prev.","An enjoyable read, but lacking some of the intesity of some of his previous novels. If you like Grishom novels you will probably enjoy this one as well."
1,His worst yet.,"A not particularly interesting novel which preaches for the homeless but portrays them as the most unappealing group of people imaginable. Why would anyone give up his career to help people who won't help themselves and make life dificult for those who try to help them? The scene at the beginning in which a man with a gun holds a roomful of lawyers hostage was appealing, however. It would have been vastly improved if he had shot them all!"
1,A pathetic disguise of Grisham's liberal slant on bums,"I guess all of his money has made John Grisham soft! This book is a poor attempt at turning his liberal philosophizing on the ""plight"" of bums in Washington DC into a novel. If you can choke down the thinly disguised tirades, there are three or four interesting paragraphs in the books about real estate deals. As a John Grisham fan, especially of the Rainmaker, I'm severely disappointed in this book, and will treat future works with healthy skepticism."
2,too much sociology andtoo little mystery,This book is by no means up to the usual Grisham standard.After a good start it rapidly goes down hill as we hear the usual blather about the downtrodden and the story gets lost in a cloud of selfrecrimmination. The ending is contrived.
2,Not one of Grisham's better books,"Read the synopsis by Amazon.com and you've essentially read the book. This is a book written in a straight narrative form with no sense of characterization, no suspense, no plot to speak of. However, it is a good tract to make the reader who is unaware of the plight of the homeless more aware. That is the book's only real worth. The editing in regard to usage and punctuation is slipshod at best. It is an easy read, and if the reader is waiting for a plane or bus it's a fast easy read while waiting. It will tax no one's brainpower but it will kill time if time needs killing."
3,recommend,"After being thoroughly disappointed with my last Grisham reading experience ""Bleachers"" (a departure from the lawyer novels), I started ""The Street Lawyer"" with smaller expectations and was delighted to find out why I like his work. It started great, and the pages went flying by. The protagonist Attorney Michael Brock is truly a guy you root for, which helps you get caught up in the rollercoaster of events that follow him.I must say the ending fell flat for this reader, but the rest of the book is good enough to invest your time in. Recommend."
1,"Boring, formula writing, a disappointment.",If you liked Grisham's previous books you won't like this one.
3,Typical Grisham with a message,"I found the book enjoyable, Grisham can move a story along, though a little too preachy for light summer reading. His desciptions of the plight of the homeless were poignant and seems to reflect the author's basic decency. The plot was a little too contrived. The characters too archetypal, especially Mordecai. The main character Michael Brock is the best part of the book. His transformation from callow workaholic to human being was the reason I kept turning the pages. I found ""The Street Lawyer"" superior to his last effort ""The Partner"", though I wish he can produce another ""A Time to Kill."""
1,Disappointing and boring and those are it's good qualities.,"It took me 4 tries to ever get myself to finish this book. The only ""real"" characters in the book were the girl and her children who died. Mr. Grisham has evidently not ""lived"" in the real world and seen poverty first hand, or had to work for $30,000. per year like some of his readers have. While I believe Mr. Grisham truly ""believes"" in his topics, and in the ""statements"" that he is trying to make, however, I feel that he did not do his homework on this one."
3,NOT JUST ANOTHER GRISHAM,"I got this book as soon as it came out of the book, literally. and I found it hard to put down. I have heard that the reviews on this book have not been very good but then reviewers aren't always right. It was obvious from the start that this was more than just another money maker for Mr. Grisham, this was something that was coming from the heart. I enjoyed it emencely and plan to read it again. This would make a good T.V. special or movie about the homeless as this is a problem that really needs the attention of the American public. Thank you Mr. Grisham for your inspiring words."
1,Oooof!,"i cant believe i actually paid money for this book. the only thing that would make this story worse is if some bonehead made it into a movie. no plot, no development of characters, one of his worst."
1,SKIP THIS GRISHAM BOOK,"I have read all of the Grisham books. In the past I have looked forward to his next book. However, after The Street Lawyer, I am not sure if I will read another. The book does start out pretty good. Then as you are reading through it gets a little old hearing how the homeless problems are due to the Republicans & the rich white people who do not care. THIS IS RIDICULOUS! Thank heavens that this book was only 345 pages in LARGE print. I advise that you take more time on your next novel Mr. Grisham and begin writing again like you did in a Time to Kill, The Partner, etc... Go back to the way you wrote so that you won't lose long term readers."
1,A Struggle To Complete,"I am a true Grisham fan after reading nearly all his books. However, I guess he is human and can't hit a home run every time out. This one is a real strikeout compared to the rest of his work. It is slow moving and it's basically an uninteresting story. I labored through the pages of boring information about the homeless that were weaved through a bland storyline and unlikable characters. All with the unfulfilled hope and expectation that the book would improve to Grisham's usual quality. It was a chore to finish and all through it I was made to feel guilty about living above the poverty line. Of course, I doubt that Grisham has ever gone hungry and slept under a highway bridge either."
3,"Was this written by John? Good premise, but no brass ring.",I am an avid reader of John's books - have been since his first - but this one falls far short of his usual suspenseful tales. The plot has great possibilities but John didn't develope enough strong characters as in his previous books. Three is just not enough to carry the story line. Disappointed. Will peruse the back covers and reviews more carefully in the future.
4,"Grisham's ""o.k."" outperforms any close second.",John Grisham is oh! so readable! I have read each and every one of his novels and look forward with the appetite of the fictionally obese to his next subject. I think he has done better....but who can presume to do better than Grisham!
3,Okay reading,"Not his best book definately.Even the jokes arent that funny sometimes. It is an okay reading, a little slow at time. Give it a go anyway. If homeless issue interest you, then you might like this book."
3,thumbs up,"although not as suspensful as others, a great story, good characters and a plain good read."
2,John's Gone Hollywood!,"The Street Lawyer is a disappointing LITTLE book that reads, to me, more like a 90-minute, cookie-cutter movie script and not the full-length, page-turning novel I'd expect from someone capable of A Time to Kill or The Partner. The opinions expressed by the author appeared long ago in The Communist Manifesto, there's no character development, and the loose ends left in end are too numerous to mention.If you can't wait for a copy at the library, at least wait for the paperback."
2,Not what I've come to expect from the master,"I bought The Street Lawyer with high hopes that it would be better than its predecessor, The Partner. I was disappointed. I was enthralled by the first two chapters; reminded that every author is entitled to a ""dud"". However after that, there was nothing. This was fundamentally the story of a guy that quit his job, got a divorce, and moved out. There was no visible antagonist, no conflict to speak of, and NO drama."
1,another one,"Dear John! The plot is known, the result is predictable, don't write another one. Unfortunately you won't change the world with your books, although I respect the subjects you pick to discover and critizize. Give me another ""Firm"" please"
4,Thought provoking,"This book captures the attention of the reader by presenting a scenario that forces the reader to address the plight of the homeless. It forces you to examine your own belief through the main character's life changing experience. By reading this book, I doubt if many will get through without wanting to try to do something to make a diffence in our society about the problems the homeless face and how many are trying to change their lives for the better."
3,Something to think about..,"The book comes out a little bit flat. What we are used usually from Grisham is nothing but excellency. It is just very unlikely, that somebody would change his life so dramatically. what is interesting, that the book makes you think. I think that was the authors main goal. I read the book in 20 minutes and I basically enjoyed it. It is easy to read and to understand. For somebody like me who reads for entertainment, Grisham is absolutely great. You may not change your life after this book but you may change your opinions..."
1,"The Great Society, $5 trillion-- but it's Reagan's fault","Sadly, Grisham has gone the way of Patricia Cornwell with me. Instead of anxiously awaiting the release of their next novel-- I'll be looking somewhere else. (Try The Unlikely Spy or Los Alamos) The Street Lawyer was horrible for several reasons. First-- the political undertow became too much. Maybe Mr. Grisham should reconsider his premise-- forty years of Democratic rule, $5 trillion dollars spent on LBJ's Great Society-- but its all the Republican's fault. Pure Hog Wash! Secondly, Grisham let his obvious political prejudice sidetrack what was admittedly a good premise. This is not a thriller. If I wanted to read an expose on the homeless, then I would pick up the Washington Post or The New York Times. Goodbye Mr. Grisham."
3,"Different from the rest, but not a total waste of time","Granted, it gets a bit preachy, but I doubt anyone could read this book without feeling some compassion for the homeless. It's not a thriller, and it's not as law-oriented as some of his past, more exciting books, but it is a thorough look at the life of the homeless and one man's response to their plight. The book begins too abruptly (i.e. he converts to a ""street lawyer"" much too quickly), and ends with a bit of a fizzle. I would've liked to seen more plot twists, and several characters were left one-dimensional. However, I do believe the book is worth reading (though NOT worth paying full price for!) by anyone with half a heart who has an afternoon to kill."
2,Disappointing - not as suspenseful as usual,I found the premise to be faulty and the treatment of the family to be superficial. The story pretended to explore some issues but this felt like a book written in haste.
2,Could have told it in half the time,"This is not one of my favorite Grisham novels. It moved slowly, and kept rehashing the same theme about the plight of the homeless."
4,great book,"This is another winner from Grisham. The books grabs you immediately by opening with a homeless person raiding a law office and holding some attorneys hostage. The story unfolds from there as the lead character does a complete turnaround with his life and goes from a money-worshipping $300/hour attorney to a $30,000/year street lawyer. Of course there is a twist in the tale, and Grisham tells it well. There is a social message as well, and it would be nice if everyone took a little something from this book and tried to make a small difference in the lives of homeless people."
1,Boring,"Dive into the world of homelessness in Washington DC? It could have been interesting but it's not. Rather, the book tries to pin guilt and point fingers. Grisham can do better than that!"
1,The worst book he has written and with a ludicrous premise.,"I have read all of Grishams books. Each one is weaker than the last. This one falls in quality and credibility as if it ran off a cliff.His premise is that all street people are wonderful citizens who would live in mansions and contribute greatly to the world if only the rest of us hard working people would stop exploiting them. On the other hand, those of us who take a responsible part in society are money grubbing evil robber barons and exploiters of these poor folk. He further contends that all druggies and alcoholics on the street want to reform, but again, you guessed it, we exploiters won't let them.If you believe this crap, you have your head in the sand. John Grisham has never met a street person in his life while a lot of us have.I will never buy or read another Grisham novel again. I am sure that bothers Mr. Moneybags a lot. Why doesn't he give all his millions to the homeless? You know the answer to that as well as I do."
2,"Good Writing, please save the politics.","If you are a big John Grisham fan, as I am, get ready to be disappointed. This book never really gets exciting. People who may like this book: Strong liberals who enjoy a famous writer using his book as a platform for more spending on social welfare programs; and second, People who live in DC may enjoy his details of the various areas of the city.If you're a Conservative Republican...STAY AWAY! You will be thoroughly annoyed by this book. Unfortunately I fall into this category and I give it a THUMBS DOWN! Read ""Time to Kill"" again."
2,An execptional disappointment from a first rate author.,"I have read and thoroughly enjoyed most of Grisham's books. It was for this reason that I started this book with great anticipation. About half way through, however, I found myself laboring not to put the book down. With more than 13 years in Santa Monica, CA, I have had more than a little exposure to the homeless. Grisham conveniently omits homeless behavior which commonly occurs in our area: aggressive and threatening panhandling, urination in public places, assaults, etc. I have no doubt that my personal experiences with the homeless have influenced my reaction to the book. Having said that, I must add that the book lacks realism and, with the exception of the ""real"" street lawyer (Mr. Green), lacks character development. It could have been a far better book with a little more realistic portrayal of homeless behavior and a little more believable principal character."
4,Best Since The Client!! Absolute Page-Turner,"He's Back! With captivating characterizations, and a setting guaranteed to melt the hardest heart, John Grisham has delved into the world of the homeless and down-trodden with a passion unseen since The Client and the Rainmaker. If you like to see a heart melt and the good guys win, you must read this book."
1,Get a Life...,"outside of Tennessee or Kentucky or wherever the heck you are from, Mr. Grisham!!! Ever since the ""The Rainmaker"" JG's creative juices have dried up. Nothing since then has read like ""The Client"", ""The Firm"", or ""A Time to Kill"". Brain cramp or what-have-you, the latest works are dull, stale, and just plain boring!"
3,Decent,"This book was pretty dissapointing in my opinion. It started out very interesting and thought-provoking when ""Mister"", the homeless man held a group of lawyers hostage. Throughout the course of the book it narrates much of Michael Brock's interaction with the homeless, which I personally found boring at times, but then again, that is what the book is about. Grisham told the story as good as anyone could have, but this was the least interesting Grisham book I have read. I only recommend it to Grisham fans or liberals."
3,"80% captivation 20% ""may cause drowsiness""","The book started out with the shock effect needed to entice readers. It then locked you in with the selt belt of guilt (because, even if you bought it paperback version, you had enough to feel guilty about). But when the tears of shame dried, and the heat of the legal battle was to hit the hottest, you could hear the flames sizzle by the subtle truths of the inplausabilities. Maybe people could be this caring, or, maybe, John Grisham was too busy writing his next novel to care for a good ending."
3,Not the best of Grisham by any means.,"Our Writer's Guild decided a few months back to discuss current fiction works by best selling authors. Grisham's new novel was rated poorly as it was slow moving and absolutely boring at times. I had the misfortune of selecting Clancy's new book for review. I can't tell you what a let down it was. The characters are weak, redundant, and have too much irrelevant background information. Not one of seven writers who reviewed these books liked it. I also agree with the reviewer from Denver who read Brad Steiger's new book, Alien Rapture. It's the talk of our fiction group and is a gripping fast read with characters you'll never forget. Also 'The Poet' and 'Blood Work' by Connelly are excellent."
2,What a let down.....,"Finally the ""new"" Grisham came to Holland, I was really looking forward to a few nights of lost sleep anxiously reading what would happen next. But, unlike all the other Grisham books this was a pure dose of Ny-Quil.. I cared about the homeless until I read this lame plot. .... Please big editors out there... I can write better than this!"
3,"Not too bad, but could've used more work","This is a long book, and it hs to be for all the bases it has to cover. The first three chapter cover a hostage sitution. Grisham should have mde the story more about this than a lawyer finding a conscience. It is a great step up from ""The Firm,"" but still Grisham needs more polish."
1,WORST Grisham to Date !!!,"Having read all of John Grisham's novels, I have to say this was by far the worst of his books to date.I can take a little ""preaching"" as long as it is woven into an interesting story.I'll be checking my next Grisham book out of the local library!"
2,Did John Grisham really write this?,"There was great potential here. I have read all the Grisham books, and when I finished, and yes, I finished, I slammed the book closed and thought...a ghost writer wrote this for Grisham. It was mundane, predictable and unrealistic as far as young yuppie lawyer suddenly pulling up stakes and being an activist. Maybe as an activist albeit in other areas, I found that hard to swallow. Well, I will wait for the next one and see if there is a pattern. Marge Hanselman"
2,Predictable,It looks like Grisham has gone the way of many authors. He's under contract to publish a book a year - regardless. This effort is far from the excitement and intrigue offered by his earlier books.
2,Bogged down,"Although this is filled with Grisham's ""formula"" of the ingenius individual taking on the system and winning, I found much of it hard to believe. That a corporate lawyer would leave everything so willingly to become an advocate for the homeless. I felt that this book had an agenda to advance the plight of the homeless, rather than to be a good book. I felt the same as when a telemarketer calls and tries to convince me to buy that vacuum cleaner no one can do without."
4,One of Grisham's Best,I found this book to be the one I could not put it down. The story flowed and moved and made me stop and think about helping others. This book is great to inspire people to help those less fortunate. I read it so fast I am actually upset to finish. Can't wait to read the next.
2,Wait for the movie,"Just another regular Grisham novel: easy to read, full of clichès (especially regarding lawyers) and perfectly suited to be taken to the big screen. If you want my advice, wait for the movie...."
2,Sad attempt at social commentary,"In The Street Lawyer, Grisham attempts to point out how much we are wrapped up in our own lives to worry about our fellow man.A supposedly crazy homeless man takes some lawyers hostage, and then gets killed for his efforts. Michael Brock, one of the hostages, discovers a conspiracy, by his own law firm, that is responsible for the homeless man's actions as well as the death of a family forced to sleep in a car.This book is filled with help the Homeless propaganda (not that I dislike the homeless) and it ruins what could have been a great plot."
1,this was a best seller?,"Reading this book has become a chore and it amazes me how many people have given it such good reviews. It's too bad that the only vehicle for expressing the plight of the homeless is through poorly written formula novels. From start to finish it has been boring, predictible and has only made me think less of Grisham. Having never read any of his other books I will say right now that I never will. It's a loss that the public buys into this kind of writing...the grown up version of Nancy Drew."
1,Same old thing....,"I was very disappointed with John Grisham's latest effort. I am an attorney and a liberal democrat, but I am getting sick of the ""disguntled young attorney"" plot Mr. Grisham has been rehashing in all of his books lately, and I resent being lectured about how awful greedy lawyers are by a man who makes $60 million a year.I admire Mr. Grisham's efforts to use his popularity and immense readership as a forum for discussing the plights of the poor and homeless. Too bad the message he was trying to convey gets lost due to the book's overly preachy, ""holier-than-thou"" attitude."
4,A pretty accurate depiction of the homeless problem.,"Having worked with the homeless, mentally ill, and mentally retarded for four years, this book ,while not exciting, accurately portrays the problems and short-term solutions to the homeless problem. The ending of the book was very accurate in portraying the long-term, almost unstoppable problems associated with trying to make worthwhile contributions to end homelessness. Grisham was dead-on in his presentation of this point. There is no single SOLUTION to the apathy almost inherent in most homeless. Good job, John."
3,"Typical Grisham, Disturbing Premise","In this tale of lawyers for the good of the few, Grisham has his usual web of charectors which include the big bad rich law firm, our hero the young lawer, and a client that just can't afford to fight the establishment. In this case, the client is the homeless. Now, I can empathize with the fight of the homeless in our country, but I cannot sympathize because, after all, we all have our problems and I, like most Americans have strived to do my best with what I have been given by God. In short, the book is okay in its telling of the story, but the fact is that I personnally will not feel guilty if I earn more money than another. The pusuit of happiness is not a gauranty but an opportunity. If that opportunity falls short in a persons life and they want to look for someone to blame, well they should look no further than the mirror."
2,"I'm still a Grisham fan, though!","I read ""The Firm"" and found myself hooked on John Grishams lawyer world, filled with intrigues and complex plots. Although the setting almost always was the same i.e. ""young ambitious, idealistic lawyer"" vs. ""big law firm and/or some other big cynical corporation"", the plot and the captivating story telling always made me keep turning those pages. ""The Street Lawyer"" has the same (tired) setting but the plot is almost non-existant! Only the first couple of chapters carried some resemblance with Grishams previous work, the rest could, for all I know, have been written by somebody else. I really hope that ""The Street Lawyer"" is just the unfortunate result of a deadline with the publisher, and that Grishams next novel will make us forget and forgive this one."
1,Boring propaganda,"John Grisham took $27 dollars from me under false pretense. This book is nothing more than page after page of meaningless stastistics and propaganda. The characters are tissue paper thin and the plot development almost nonexistent. Also, if there are so many homeless in Washington D.C. how plausable is it that Grishman's main character stumbles across that one tragic family on his first night in a shelter? Save your time and money - give this one a pass!"
1,Absolutely the worst Grisham book yet.,"This is by far the slowest, least interesting Grisham published to date. I kept waiting for it to get better, but that just never happened. He was obviously trying to just crank out another piece of work to satisfy a publishing contract. I was a huge Grisham fan in the beginning but am waning quickly. He needs to quit while he's still somewhat ahead."
3,An average addition to your Grisham collection,"This book is seems to be written with the sole purpose of highlighting the hard life of the homeless and somehow blaming all this on greedy corporate yuppies who doesn't give a damn about the unfortunate street people. Although Grisham does succesfully create a beautiful and somewhat touching picture of the homeless, the dramatic side leaves much to be desired. All in all, this one might come as a disappointment to Grisham fans, especially those who enjoy fast-paced action. If this doesn't sound interesting to you, then you would want to skip this one and pick up Grisham's next book, The Testament."
4,A story that is worthy of Grisham,"I liked the overall story, we sometimes forget about the homeless in our country and how the system works around those unfortunate people. Grisham tells us in great detail the plight of the homeless and uses the perspective of a lawyer to do it. Good job."
