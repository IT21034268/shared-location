3,Unusual Board Games,"This is a very well made board game.Unfortunately, there wasn't a lot of beta testing when writing the directions.It took awhile to figure out how to play. The game, although durable and cute, was quite mundane."
1,THIS RECORDING IS A DISGRACE!,Back in 69 a man named Stephen Sondheim wrote a brilliant show called Company. In 96 a cd was released that puts the brilliant show to shame. Sheila Gish [borrows from] Elaine Stritch as Joanne. The man who plays Bobby sounds like an infant with a nasal problem. The girl who plays Amy makes Amy into a caricature of the character. I have heard people say that this revival is comparable to the original... while I must admit I have never seen this production I must say that I find the cd version aweful
3,book review,"a break from the boring English crossword puzzles,and use to keep the French skills up to date."
5,Five and then some.,"While not myself old, I am a long-time listener of The Cranberries. Some of the older songs, as well as the newer, evoke nostalgic memories. Thus I get that sad-mixed-with-happy feeling when listening to the album. ""Zombie,"" and ""Salvation"" are two of my personal favorites, as I am a fan of some of the faster tracks. I do agree with some of the other reviewers that there is a certain uniformity about this album - some of their slower recordings could have been implemented. One that I would have chosen is ""Chocolate Brown."" However, I do believe that each past album was well-represented and, of course, one can't please everyone when producing a ""greatest hits"" album."
4,Not a match with the IN24 Projector,"Just a note to let you know that this case is much smaller than the IN24 projector from InFocus. I was confused by the fact that is was listed in the ""accessories"" on the projector page, and ""fits mobile line of projectors"".Another reviewer says that the CA-SOFTCASE-02 fits this projector fine.Other than that - it seems to be a nice case for the price. (my rating is based on 'if it fit' then I'd like it - oh well)"
4,An excellent apron for my tasks.,"I got this apron because I work with a lot of small parts and end up with them in my pants pocketsat the end of a task. This apron solves that problem. The parts now end up in the apron pockets.I am 5'10"" at 160Lbs and the apron is a perfect fit."
5,Good product,"I have used three different brand of these hair fibers I'm so thankful that I don't have to be concerned with people looking at my scalp and balding head. It works so well that I think of it as a miracle. Thank you Lord. My daughter found this for me years ago and being on a fixed income, it is affordable. I only use it when I'm having company or going out. You just sprinkle it on the areas where needed. It does leave a thin dust around my white sink. I sometimes lay a towel across the sink area before applying or better yet go to another room that is bigger. I don't even need a mirror anymore as I can sprinkle this on my scalp and when I check it is all nice and filled in , in all the right places. It looks like I have a full head of hair. This has stopped all comments about my thinning hair."
5,"""new music"" from 75 years ago","this is my first introduction to varese, so i can't compare it against the many other recordings available. but i likewhat i hear- it's amazing that most of these pieces were composed over 75 years ago.from the loopy but compelling ""offrandes"" (settings of surrealest poetry) to the orchestral-industrial riot of""deserts"", this stuff isn't easy listening but has an odd internal logic of horns, precussion and angry strings.someone commented parts of deserts sounds like a videogame of some sort. i think the inclusion of the tape sounds was a wonderfully brave move and makes the whole piece work; i can't even imagine it without the tapes sounds now.bravo again to naxos for making such interesting music more popular, and please issue a volume 2 with the rest of this amazing composer's small output."
2,Santiago,Wasn't what I expected. I enjoyed the cd but there was an awful wide spectrum of music not typical of the Chieftans. You may like it but I recommend listening first.
2,The dialect matters! This is northern vietnamese!,"Please note! This software teaches the northern Vietnamese dialect. Try talking to your Vietnamese friends in the U.S. (who are mostly from the south) and they will look at you funny.It becomes clear early on in the lessons...... Yes is ""Vang"" northern dialect... ""U"" southern dialect. And from there it goes down hill.If you plan to communicate with people from the north, you will be good to go. Otherwise, think long and hard before buying this program as you will spend some time ""unlearning"" some language concepts."
4,A great compact resource,"Although it's stated that the book is not for beginners, I needed to get a grasp on C# and quickly. My exposure to OOP made the reading less daunting. Most of the other books out there are tomes, but this book is concise with enough examples to illustrate the featured concepts (I admit I had to read certain parts multiple times to absorb what was being conveyed). I needed a book I could easily carry around with me and serve as quick and comprehensive reference and this one was it. The book concepts, despite the title, do apply to C# 3.5."
4,Solved the problems,This paper was exactly what I needed to make calendars for my family. The pictures came out well much better than on regular paper.
1,Horrible paper,"Can't even call this photo paper because it is so thin. I took it out of the wrapper and wondered if I had even ordered photo paper. If I could give it a zero, I would."
5,Good Read!,"Again, I am a huge fan of the Amish mysteries. I applaud the fact that the writers of these books don't have to fill them up with salty language and that the continuity of their story lines is thought provoking yet entertaining. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys this type of story. This book in particular has many twists and turns and comes to a surprising conclusion. The horrific event that begins the story of unraveling this mystery is a ""can't put down"" type of book - I read this book through in 1 day!"
1,Avoidance training for tots,"I was very disappointed in this book -- compared to a number ofmore positive potty-training books, this one seemed to focus way toomuch on NOT going potty. It also contains messages about trainingpotties being for ""pip squeaks."" Overall, I found this bookmore harmful than helpful in our potty training efforts."
3,Ultimate Goal Was Not Achieved,An enjoyable book with very cute illustrations. My almost 2 &almost 4 yr old both enjoyed it but it didn't work any magicwith either one of them.
2,Skip this book and read the autobiography,"I had hoped the author would have some true insight to Mr Cash's life and work, but this most definitely is not the case. The book reads like a school term paper, no real insight just a gathering of quotes providing a workman-like overview of Mr Cash's life and work with emphasis placed on the religious aspects. Not a bad book, but definitely not good either. A reader would be much better served with Mr Cash's autobiography."
3,Tele Atlas Shortcoming,"Please be aware that all products based on Tele Atlas maps (including TomTom) do not tell you what side of the street your destination is on. Most, if not all NAVTEQ products will do this. This limitation can be really frustrating when your destination is on a busy, multi-lane street, or if it is hidden in a large strip mall. You will have to resort to checking for odd/even street numbers - or take a 50/50 chance. This is a big negative for me, and I hope TomTom addresses it soon."
1,Does not work with Palm TX,"Software on DVD does not support Palm TX. I have tried to upgrade from Navigator 5.0 to 6.0. I have find out on another forum, that for Palm TX Navigator 6.0 has to be preinstalled on the SD card."
5,Loved it!,"I became engrossed in this book from the minute I started reading it. Ms.O'Connor has that uncanny knack of being able to write insightfully about both men and women, and as I grew to know them intimately and experience their emotions and passions, I found myself deeply rooting for each of them. Their attitudes towards the theatre and towards each other kept growing and changing -- always with a wit underneath that was enormously appealing. I felt as if I had spent many hours with friends I cared about. I hated finishing this book..."
3,Poor Customer Support,"Arrived broken and I had to rather forcefully insist on a replacement, but it arrived eventually."
5,Fabulous,"This is simply a tremendous collection of songs, and one that gets even better each time you listen. The song writing and lyrics are very accomplished, but best of all, the melodies soar. Yes, there are melodies that you can even remember and sing! I recently was fortunate to see Jason Brown's new show, The Last Five Years, and just keep becoming a bigger fan."
2,"You, sir, are no Stephen Sondheim","I wish this disc were a lot more interesing than it is. Unmemorable songs with no reason for them to be together. Some songs start off in interesting ways but then just bland-out. Broadway is a popular art, and these songs don't have a chance of popularity nor are they particularly arty."
2,Odd history,This is a pretty book and no doubt i contains much of value. However the article on the history of Finland is fundamentally flawed and quite misleading. For example it claims that language conflicts have been a central issue in the history of Finland. That is has little to do with reality. The article is so odd it makes you wonder what sources have been used. It also makes the whole book seem quite unrealiable. It's a shame because the book is nice enough otherwise and could probably fill a gap in many a book shelves.
3,Classic C&C but too many instumental tracks.,This had potential to be one of the best that they had ever produced. It had a few hilarious tracks on it but it also had too many instrumental tracks from the movie. All in all it is worthy of the price. I recommend this to all the Cheech and Chong fans out there.
3,A Knight to Remember,"A Knight to Remember is one of her earlier books with a familiar storyline of that period. Nice reading, but not up to her later standards."
5,"Bold, original medieval romance at its finest!","Funny, poignant, and wonderfully sexy, this book will keep you warm on a winter's night"
5,Small World Express Foam Block Set,"Great toy! Fun to build with and talk about shapes, colors, etc. Also good toy for social skills!The feel of the foam blocks is fun. This toy has lasted us great for 2 years now (give or take a year, I don't remember for sure when we bought it).I can't think of a single block that has been damaged in our set - and our little guy is hard on toys.Downside, although it comes in a nice zip container - it takes sometime to try to fit the blocks all back in again after playing with them. We did start using a really big empty cat litter tub with a lid that they all easily fit back into."
5,fun with foam blocks,"These are durable foam blocks that are great for building with. My kids love them. So much more fun and safer than wooden blocks. You won't be able to fit them into the storage bag again, but a nice rubbermaid works great. Lots of blocks at a good size and cost in this set."
4,An Overlooked GEM,"The music might not be of the hightest caliber like the violin sonatas by Brahms and Beethoven,and it may sound as background music at first hearing (which is not bad at all), but with little attention you'll start to heart that ""gloomy/sorrowful"" Mendelssohnian touch in these violin/piano works. Lots of references to his string quartets and piano trios can be found here too. Pure Mendelssohn; and highly recommended for the violin/piano lovers and Mendelssohn's fans. Sound quality and price are great."
1,First conspiracy was the last for me,"I purchased this book to read the authors thoughts about man made saucer craft based on Tesla inventions and technology. BUT what does the author do? Attack the Christian faith with a conspiracy theory not even worth considering. NO factual basis what so ever. The vehement atheist was spousing his hate and religion to the point of ad nauseum. If the author had an axe to grind about GOD well then write a book about that and title it so. Dont decieve with one title a preach something else.I did not read the book because if his factual gathering was indicated by his Christian/Roman creation conspiracy well then i have better things to do than to read someones malevolent fantasy.Sorry, but that is my review the first chapter and its erroneous theories were all i needed to shelve this one for good."
2,Too much ranting,"This could have been a thought provoking book but the author's rantish writing style gets in the way. He mentions some interesting things and makes claims about German saucers. The idea that the government has and is using some advanced propulsion technology, taken from the work of Tesla or the Germans, is not new. Yet his comments about IllumiNazis and InterNaziism, along with a New World Order, puts him into a category that is too extremist. You will not find a calm, reasoned argument here. Is it possible that the US government has such technology and is using it in total secrecy, as oppposed to blaming its existence on aliens? It is possible. I recommend Flying Saucer Aircraft by Bill Rose for those looking for a few more details and a more reasonable tone."
4,Very good value,"If you're looking for a sub-$100 head unit with a front aux input, I don't think you can go far wrong with this. It's tiny buttons may not be to everyone's taste, and it's true that the brightness of the display is weak in daylight, but these are minor issues.It sounds great, is able to play mp3 and wma, and most importantly for me has the front aux input.One more minor gripe - when you turn off the ignition, the CD tray is not powered, meaning if you want to take a CD out of the player, you must remember to do it before you turn the key. Not sure why they didn't wire the CD tray motor to the constant power, rather than switched."
4,good low budget radio,woked perfect from day one till I traded vehicle. Pioneer always has great reception this unit was no exception. Better reception and much better sound then OEM. Lite on bells and whistles but good product.
2,Didn't like it...,"I bought this player. After it was installed, I realized right away that it wasn't the right stereo for me. Oh, it sounded just fine and I love the front aux input; however, I couldn't see the lcd screen. If I was driving it at night it was just fine, but it was almost invisible to me if I was driving in the sunlight. The unit does not have a way to increase the brightness on the front LCD display either. Struggling to read the display while driving is a potentially dangerous situation. I exchanged this model for a comparable Kenwood model. I have no complaints now. The Kenwood is very easy to read and it also sounds great in addition to having its own front aux input. I'd skip this model of stereo if I were you."
3,SEX! SEX! SEX!,"easy and mouse did not have these kind of adventures,but i guess my man wanted to prove that he could write porn with the best of them,lots of sex but interesting story."
3,Greg Schwartz from The Netherlands is factually wrong,"This debut Devo album was released in July 1978 and their second in mid 1979.The Human League's first single was released in June 1978. The first Thompson Twin single was released in April 1980. The first Visage single was released in late 1979.To say that Devo were in any way influenced by the aforementioned UK bands (as Greg Schwartz from The Netherlands claimed) is simply nonsense. It is true to say that all were influenced by the masters of this genre, the highly original Kraftwerk.That said, this album is their most raw and punk influenced. It contains some gems but I prefer 'Freedom of Choice' which is why I have only allocated ***.Anyone interested in the facts about Devo's development and their unique contribution to the evolution of modern music should read ""We Are Devo!"" by Jade Dellinger & David Giffels."
2,Is it the same? It is lame-oh!,"If you are looking for rarities or remixes, they are not here. The extra disc is a 2009 nostalgia concert. It's not bad, but nothing we haven't heard before. If you have the original disc and you're not a hard core fan, save your money."
1,Amblin' Tame,"I bought this for ""Serenade in Blue"" and I have never heard a worse version. The vocals are weak and insipid, both lead and support, the music is bland, there is no drama or tension. The whole CD is easy listening background music with swoopy strings, muted brass, minimal percussion, tinkling piano, all the volume and tone levelled off.The audio quality seems good.This is great music, of course, but a dreadful interpretation."
4,Melissa & Doug Cardboard Blocks,"My kids really enjoy playing with these blocks. Like people in other reviews have said, we wish they included more of the red blocks and less of the yellow ones. There's not enough to make a fortress wall, etc. These aren't as durable and thick as the ones I played with as a child, but they are reinforced so that if a small child stepped on one, they won't flatten easily. Overall, good for the price, but we may need to buy more red blocks."
5,Just like I remember them,This is a great product. Putting the blocks together is a tad tricky on the first one but after that you understand.
2,Too Many Yellow Blocks!,"I thought the kids would be able to build forts/castles or other big structures with the blocks. After all, 40 blocks sounds like a lot. But 24 of those blocks are small yellow ones that aren't very useful. So far, my kids (ages 5-1/2 and almost 3) have only built tall towers with the blocks and don't seem very interested after some initial playing. Melissa and Doug used to offer a 12 piece red brick-only set, but that's been discontinued. So I'm considering buying a supplemental set made by someone else. I'm very disappointed."
2,I just don't get it,This album is catching quite a bit of buzz as one of the top albums of the year. I've tried to get into it but maybe I'm mistaking his quirkiness for just being off key. A few of the songs kind of remind me of Belle and Sebastian but a lot less entertaining.
3,does not stay on well,"These bandages seem to be the best around, but the adhesive doesn't stay on and they rub off after a few hours. Expensive for just a few hours."
3,Not enough info,I bought a bar for my girls to practice at home and thought this would be helpful to protect there hands from blisters but the sizes were too small. If its suppose to be for beginners I assumed the small would be good for my 7 year old but they were too tight. The straps bother them. It rubs at there wrist and is more painful than blisters. Haven't tried anything else yet to compare to trying to find a local place that my girls could try on the grips first. Just overall a poor quality for beginner gymnastic. Maybe even give directions with the product. They are beginners and just learning about these extras.
5,The Postmodern Condition,"I liked this book because it gives good summaries of the thought of many of the most important Postmodern theorists: Baudrillard, Derrida, Deleuze and Guitarri, Foucault, etc. Also, it is entertaining. If you are a humanities major or even a science major, I would recommend it--as postmodernism impacts the sciences as well."
5,Awesome performances,The sound remastering is the best I've heard of the Beethoven 7th. This is my first hearing of the Beethoven 5th. The remastering is also good.
2,Small,Is to small for even the smaller crabs. Also it does not hold alot of water and gets tipped easily.
4,Crab Dish,"It was a good size for my medium sized hermies but it does tip very easily, i like the detail into the palm trees but be sure to get thick sand or gravel to hold this in place!"
5,Fun toy for my Jeep lover.,"Purchased as a birthday gift for my 4 -year old, who loves Jeeps and the color yellow. Hard to believe how difficult it was to find a quality Jeep toy in yellow that was bigger than a Matchbox car! My son is delighted with it, and as he is a little rough on his toys, I was happy as well to discover it had excellent build quality and durability. I wasn't familiar with Bruder toys before this one, but now I will be sure to recommend them for future purchases."
5,A very exciting book!,"This book is great! It starts off boring but as the party for Emily gets out going, the book really heats up! It was great! As AJ, Phils depressed friend finds beer the party takes a turn for the worst, I won't give much away, but the part about the school election isn't the best. But overall, this book will keep you reading so much, you will be done very fast! I would definatly recommend this book for anyone that loves all diferent elements in a book, comedy, drama and so much more!"
2,It was ok.,"I thought it was ok, but it is totally unlike Stevie and Alex to do what they did. I really hope that they doesn't do anything like that again. I liked the other Pine Hollow Books alot better."
4,Good DVD,Nice DVD to watch. This dvd is fun and Phong Le did a great job. Wait for the new music released soon.
2,A book of very limited value,"I read the second edition of this book, and based off that I will not be buying the third edition. It was not a very well written book. The chapters jumped around as the author tried to cover everything in chronological order for Boeing and the companies it later bought such as McDonnell Douglas. His accounts of the events are from the perspective of senior Boeing management, and that is the real value of the book. It gives the reader a feel for how Boeing's leadership saw events. That is why I gave it two stars rather than one star. Bauer often leaves out key facts when discussing events, such as certain things with the contract the company did during the strike of 1948. Otherwise, if you want a good account of Boeing's history, read something else such as Flying High or The Sporty Game."
3,Colgate Anti-Gingivitis Anti-bacterial Oral Rinse,"Colgate Phosphorus-Fluoride Anti-Cavity Rinse, Grape Flavour, 16 Oz, was received as ordered. Purple Fluid Mouth Wash was bought in anticipation of Anti-Gingivitis as well as Anti-Bacterial cleaning action on tooth plaque."
5,Could not have expected how great this would be!,"I saw this band on the (Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth's record label) Ecstatic Peace website and didn't think much of it. The name didn't catch me and the album cover was non-descript. Then I heard one of the songs on the Ecstatic Peace podcast and was blown away. The music sounded like sonic youth but stripped down (mostly just voice and two guitars with some percussion) slow, medative and beautiful. I ordered it instantly.It arrived today and I have listened to eight or nine times in a row, no joke.If you like the new folk stuff, specifically the awesome atmmosphere of all those new england bands, then you will love this.If you are a Sonic Youth fan who likes to hear their influence young interesting bands, you will love this.Although if you don't like Sonic Youth don't be deterred, this is a folk album, full of three minute vocal driven songs.This record is perfect for autumn, if you are reading this you really should just buy it."
4,Reliable,"For years this product has aided in smoother skin and hyperpigmentation. Exfoliation without irritation, however find a good moisturizer to pair with."
2,The Salt Test Is Better!,"So first off, this thing does work. The only problem is that it takes a good 36 hours to reach 75%. The salt test on the other hand only needs about 6 hours. I gave it 2 stars because it does actually work. I docked it for the amount of time it takes."
4,Just fine,"This calibration kit worked just fine, but really have no way to check the accuracy of the bag so I have to take their word for it."
3,Good For Novices,"Calibrated two different hygrometers in a couple of days. This is good for first-timers and isn't terribly expensive. However, I doubt I'll buy one of these again. You can build your own with a ziplock bag, table salt, and a little water. A quick google search is all it takes."
1,Does not work at all,Very disappointed in the product. Was looking for an easy effective way to calibrate my hydrometers - this is NOT it. Tried two different hydrometers and the initial reading after 24 hours was 83%. After two more days of adjustments both hydrometers were turned down to there minimum settings and the reading was still 78%. Could never calibrate to 75%. I will either go back to the salt method or buy another hydrometer that doesn't require calibration. I would guess the actual reading inside the bag was really 83% instead of the claimed 75%.
5,Great product,"Bought this in conjunction with a humidor and it's very easy to use,directions were simple to understand. Have no issues with this product at all!"
2,amco swing-a-way 711bk comfort grip jar opener,"I was disappointed with this product. It's not long enough and not wide enough. I had an older Jar Opener that was simular but was longer and much wider it worked fine but was starting to rust so I threw it away, big mistake...I think that Amco needs to go back to the ""Drawing Board""..."
5,Brilliant!!,One of the best kitchen accessories ever - no more marks on the door jamb and no more bad language!!
2,Great to Good to Bad,"As others noted, this is a fine product starting out. After a year it seems to require more recharging; and, after two years, it dies! The unit and its battery charger literally stop working. So you be judge of how long you'd like it to last. Candidly, I was hoping for 4-5-more (indefinitely). Unless they've changed things, be prepared to buy again after year-2."
2,"Works well, rechargeable battery only lasts a few years","Trimmed well, after about a year, one of the spring fell out and a couple years later, the rechargeable battery no longer held charge and one is unable to operate it when it's plugged in, so I had to get rid of it :-( I hate things to break where I can no longer use it & have to create more landfill..."
3,The Eurovision Flop,"This is a typical Eurovision song from Greece. This was the big winner, but in my opinion there were songs greater than this (for example the portuguese entrance ""Amar"" from 2B or The Netherlands song."
1,Horrible!,I can't believe that this documentary from 1997 got such good reviews. I am very familiar with the Willowbrook School saga. This docummentary.....I give up. It was just plain awful!
2,Nope,It's more personal stories told second hand. I thought it would be about the place but it wasn't. Not for me
2,Disappointing,I am pretty familiar with the history of Willowbrook and found myself really disappointed with this movie.. It was really short and gave almost no history of Willowbrook.. so if you are watching it with someone with no Willowbrook knowledge prepare yourself to pause it every few minutes to explain things..
2,On the Tree Top,Not what I thought it was so cannot rate it. Was not looking for poetry or verse. Someone who is looking for this type of book should review not me.
1,Just don't use this piece of ...,"There is a secret about using these reels. Sort of best practice, using which, you will get much better results.Example. If you are about to buy, say, 8 of these reels, $7.99 each plus quite not cheap shipping, than take four or five (depending on how far you are) 20-bucks billets and 8 undeveloped films with your best shots. Put this all in a plastic bag, take it with your right hand if you are right-handed or with your left hand if you are left-handed, come to a window, open it, and chuck the bag out to the window. This is much more effective way of using these reels, believe me. It will save a lot of time and nerves for you."
1,Waste of Money,Don't waste your money on this . It is not worth the plastic it is burned on. The Only tears was when I listened to this trash and thought of the money I spent on it. I tosed it in the trash. I would have thrown it away if it was free.
1,perhaps if you've never cooked?,"This was the first 'cook book' I purchased after being diagnosed with asthma and mutiple food allergies (including wheat, milk and peanuts).What a disappointment. I don't know how they can print a plain baked potato as a recipe?This book might be helpful if you've never cooked before, but for anyone that knows how to bake a potato or steam vegetables it's probably a waste of money."
2,"Cant run most yard trimmers, etc","Dont make mistake i did....you need 14 gauge or 16 for most yard trimmers and yard appliances...this one doesnt ""cut it""..."
5,Awesome!,I bought this cable to use with my lawn mower. It's incredible long and durable. With it I don't have to be changing outlets to reach all the corners of my garden. Highly recommended!
3,OK but dirty,"This extension cord seems OK, but I was surprised at how dirty it was on arrival. I wanted to use it indoors, so I had to wipe it all down first. I've never bought an extension cord that was that dirty. If you plan to use the cord indoors, I'd recommend choosing a different one."
5,Good deal,"I didn't want to go the store and since I was buying something already, pairing this with it made it an even better deal. The cord works great as it should. I use it to power a bug zapper that is connected to an outdoor timer."
3,"I'd say skip it, but what else is there????","Strange, but somehow appropriate, that no one has yet to write a definitive bio on Neil Young. There were some elements in here worth reading, but only if you're the most rabid of Young fans. Otherwise, stick with the The Rolling Stone Files, a comprehensive collection of articles and interviews with the man from the pages of that magazine."
4,"""The gift that keeps on giving.""","This item given as a gift to a Chuck Norris fan. He was surprised to get the whole set. Haven't heard any complaints, but have not heard whether he has watched it yet. I considered it a great gift for him."
4,Sweet!,"My dad was so happy the day that my mom handed these to him. He couldn't wait to start watching them. Thanks for the great service, as per usual!!"
1,The Worst Trading Book Ever Written?,"This book is lacking in so many areas incuding but not limited to substance, accuracy,interest and relevance.The writing and editing are laughable(check out the author's comments above)!This book offers compelling proof in one area:The random typing of chimpanzees is rapidly evolving towards Shakespeare!"
4,900mAh Great Value,Amazon must be shipping a new batch. got them today and they were 900mAh and made in Japan. Good value compared to local shops.
5,Dio At His Best.,"Heaven and Hell ranks among the best Black Sabbath albums and it's Ronnie James Dio at his best. Their last 2 albums with Ozzy had a lot of potential but there were several mediocre tracks. H&H is Black Sabbath reborn and it they changed direction a bit in the early '80s, some fans liked it and some didn't. ""Neon Knights"" is an excellent opening track among other gems throughout like ""Die Young"" which is my favorite track off the whole album. H&H is a gem in heavy metal that's not worth missing."
3,It isn't Ozzy!,This album simply is not as good as the Black Sabbath with Ozzy. This music is more predictable and less omninous. I thought it sounded like a cross between Uriah Heep and Deep Purple. Dio just does not instill that sense of dread and doom that Ozzy did.
5,"Hey, this is great.","Open your heart. Oz days were good. But don't you think this is also amazing? I think Heaven and Hell is the best work of Sabbath. Children of the sea, Heave and hell are breathtaking. Lonely is the word is the best epilogue."
5,It Goes On and On,"It's difficult to believe this release is 23 years old. To me, the recording is as fresh as it was when I first purchased it many years ago. Every song is top notch and production first rate.My purpose for anyone who reads this is to try to find the import CD of ""Heaven and Hell"" on Gimcastle/Castle Communications. This version has been remastered and a nice booklet featuring the song lyrics and rarely seen photos of the band circa 1980 (although I'm not sure why the photo that was originally in the gatefold of the ""Paranoid"" album is here).Note to Warner Brothers records: So you want induce people to buy music and not download it, then take your profits and update this release!"
4,A new flavour to good old Sabbath,"H&H features a different vocalist for the first time. Dio is a little shy here, as replacing the living myth Ozzy isn't an easy thing. Some songs soon became classics for their grandeur: ""Neon Nights"", ""H&H"" and ""Lonely Is The World"", this last being a beautiful power ballad. On the other hand some songs here are rather poor: ""Lady Evil"", ""Wishing Well"" and ""Walk Away"". Doesn't compromise the album's integrity, though."
2,Very biased; Not Objective; Irresponsible Journalism,"Ms Brennan is obviously biased towards Michelle Kwan and should not have access to major newspapers like USA Today. To quote Scott Hamilton's recent letter to the editor, Ms Brennan ""promote's Michelle at Tara's expense"". Her work epitomizes irresponsible journalism."
4,my thoughts,"although i found this book engaging and enjoyed reading about the lives of these skaters, i personally felt that the anti-taraism was uncalled for. Having had the opportunity to have met both Tara and Michelle, I know that Tara did have her ways of coming off as arrogant, but so did Michelle. She is not as sweet and even tempered as christine made her out to be. It's a wonder why she doesnt mention the reason to why her past dress maker [Marie Talbot] stopped making her dresses. Her comment about her scores in the kiss and cry area [apparently she felt that she deserved a higher score regardless of her mistakes] . Dont bash on one skater and make the other skater come off as the nice one, they all have their ways of being arrogant."
2,lovely static,"I am returning these because of the static. The sound quality on the right is fairly good, but the left has so much static that I just can't use them. I'm extremely disappointed."
4,Very Good!,"Death & despair are everywere! As everyday residents of Los Angeles are doing their daily routines, then everyone's worst nightmare-an earthquake strikes! This is what you get when you live in a earthquake zone! I know a good movie when I see it & it is very good. I prefere the first ""Earthquake"" but this one is equally as good. I also ordered this one & can hardly wait to see it again!Horror of Dracula"
3,I AM VERY ANGRY!,"I saw this movie on television when it was a Two Part mini series. Then it was re-released as a 3 hour version. This version is so ugly and short that the movie has no guts to it any more. they didnt even remove the names off the credits of some of the people whose parts they removed. I love the first two versions. If anyone has the origional on tape or the second airing. Not to mention they never mention the father at the end, so his character basically is dead. Awfull cut."
3,Something Is Missing,Have purchased other products from this company and have come up with the same results with mixes. Something is missing even after adding my own ingredients. This is not even close to the gumbo made from scratch. To me this is not a good substitute (even if you are short on time).
5,Bonnie Raitt - The Glow,"I am writing this review of Bonnie Raitt's The Glow. This album is one of the best cd's of Bonnie Raitt's that I own. In the late 1980's, when this album first came out I didn't hear any of it. Just recently I purchased it and put it on my stereo I was totally blown away!!! This is one of the best rock and roll/ Blues cd's!! The song I, Thank You took me by surprise. It reminded me of some of the songs on Sweet Forgiveness. Bonnie's voice is so mellow and bluesy all in one. Thankyou, Bonnie for recording such a wonderful cd full of Rock,Rhythm andBlues!! Jane Elizabeth Hames"
2,I don't know why I finished this book,"First of all, this book has an introduction to each chapter that doesn't have to do anything with the main story, those introductions together are at least 100 pages. Everything that happens at the investigation is written at least three times, (when Michael Daley discovers it, when he tell his ex wife and at the trial), this takes off about 40 pages, and at the end, when one of the suspects kill his/herself and wrote a letter and with that letter everybody knows who was the killer, and after that nobody could do nothing to catch him, is really pathetic."
2,Beware!,"I bought my i3 in Europe and enjoyed it very much until time came to upgrade it. The upgrade that I bought and paid $75 for will not work with my unit, even though the people at Garmin say it will. I am being bounced back and forth between tech support in Europe and North America. To add insult to injury, the last rep that I talked to in America was very rude. This purchase was not worth the hassle and the ripoff that ensued."
3,Owned mine for two years,"I've had my Street Pilot for two years now and am surprised to see it is still selling for such a high price. While a great gps that has served me well, the scroll bar is very time consuming and inconvenient compared to touch screens and the screen is quite small. I got my money out of this machine but can now buy a new touchscreen for only $40 more so this one is no longer worth the price!"
4,"Great, except slow startup times","I have this now for over 4 months. There are only 2 problem that I find with it. One has to do with the startup time. It takes good couple of minutes or so for it to acquire signal on start, and additional 20+ seconds to build the route. When you are in hurry, this causes frustrations. Their maps are not 100% accurate when it comes to divided highways and jug-handle left turns (only in NJ).I have not used any other portable GPS system, and hence can't provide any comparative review.Other than that, I am extremely happy with all the features:1. detour (too good)2. database of nearby things (unbelievable)3. voice clarity (fantastic)4. menus simplicity and navigation (5 stars)"
4,Great size Easy Navigation,I originally bought this due to the price point and didn't realize how good it was until I hit the road. Easy to change views using the click wheel and back button. Unit only has three buttons. Other reviews really fill in the other details. My only complaint is one-way streets don't show up. I wan a unit I can drive anywhere with and not get lost. Being told to turn down a one-way doesn't help. It does recalculate your route very quickly so you can just go to the next street and you'll get there.
4,Another Motor Coach gadget,"Motor Coach and RV owners tend to be gadget crazy. I purchased this from Amazon for a motorcoach I recently purchased. Unfortunate that the dealer didn't order the coach with a factory installed GPS, but I calculate I saved 2000-3000 dollars. I am not repeating all the other pro's and con's of other reviewers but for those that are driving 40 foot coaches and pulling a tag, it is invaluable for crowded city driving. You are audiably warned well in advance which lane to be in and thus avoids those dreaded missed turns because you are in the wrong lane. I agree the screen is small for us oldies over 25, but the voice is loud enough even for us old folks to hear that your turn or destination lies ahead. I have a larger screen GPS in my tow and that would be nice, but for the dollar spent, this is a good investment."
3,No Luck with the First One,"I bought this scope from Dicks Sporting Goods and paid $49 for it.I put it on my Marlin 60 and tried to sight it in. I could not get it to zero in.The best was 6"" low and 3"" left.The features are great for the price.Great magnification range, good eye relief, illuminated reticle in either red or green and variable brightness.Comes with flip up covers, scope rings, extra hardware screws, allen wrench and a lens cloth.I just exchanged it today and have high hopes for the replacement figuring I just got a bum one. Hope it works!"
2,"A good resource, impossible read","This book was a required textbook for a Germanic linguistics class I had just recently. Forget about any sort of enjoyable reading, like some textbooks. No, this one does not qualify as ""engrossing."" Rather, though chock-full of linguistical information including an interesting chapter on German spelling reforms, the book is written in a scientific, flat, shall I say ""boring?"" and distincly British fashion. It has the feeling it was written in the 1940s or 1950s, and I was surprised to find it was written in 1994.If you have a short, or even medium-length, attention span, I'd recommend finding backup tutoring, because you will have trouble reading this one cover-to-cover. Its unfortunate, because the information contained therein has potential to fascinate, but written about in such style has little potential to motivate one to puruse further into the world of linguistics. In a word: awful!"
4,Kit for LG phone,The kit is a nice bargain. The charger is little flimsy but works well. The case is a nice snug fit and the clip that holds it is top quality. Very sturdy. Good bargain.
3,Mediocre,"This was an OK show. Light on action shots of the animals in question, heavy on shots of the crew preparing for shots. When they did show the animals, the photography was not engrossing. It felt like many of the ""natural"" shots were setups, like a scripted reality series. I was entertained, but am very glad I found this for ~$5. If it had been much more, I would have been disappointed."
2,Two very plain B-Sides on here,"Having the main track trimmed down to a shorter length is good, but enither of the bonus tracks do anything for me. A Great Place To Leave is seriously bland, and when your Ship COmes In Tries to live on charm alone, not succeeding."
3,Good quality sandal,I paid for shipping on this and it came later than the free shipping things I bought at the same time. But the shoes are worth waiting for. If your kid has a very narrow foot a different sandal may be a better choice.
2,not quite sure,"All of the reviews say it comes with software/drivers, but I only received the converter. The product is also different from the package like others have said. If I find the drivers online I'll change my rating, but it is still kind of a hassle."
3,Problema con los sticks,"Hay cierto problema con la sensibilidad de los joysticks, o es demasiada o muy poca, nunca pude encontrar la solucion a eso, supongo que la falta de drivers tiene que ver. No lo recomiendo."
3,Bormann New Facts,Not much is known about Martin Borman. This DVD tells us much more than past videos with many interviews with Bormann's relatives. Well worth watching for those who are interested in this subject.
2,Poor Quality - Breaks regularly,"I bought this watch and all was fine for about 6 months and then it stopped working - totally. Dakota did replace it under the warranty but that took 3 months. So,I bought another to fill in the void. That one worked for about a year and then the stem came out when I did one of my twice a year changing of the time. Also, be aware any colored model will start chipping and look quite natty. Better to get a silver one as it doesn't show when it chips. If you buy this watch plan to buy a new one every year."
3,"Great watch, with some limitations","I really like this watch - the dial - numbers, military time, it glows at night, the color, the red beam light. One drawback that I have with it is - it is heavier than I thought it would be. I had a clip watch before that just wore out & it was so light weight that I didn't notice it, whether it was in my pocket or clipped on a belt loop. The size of this could be designed smaller, my previous clip watch is about 1/2 -2/3 the size of this one & I think that makes a difference in the weight.Otherwise, this is a good watch, keeps good time."
2,Caution!!!!,"Although an excellent functional product, as others have said, it is NOT the one pictured. I wanted the one pictured for a specific physical application where the attachment wire had sufficient space, the one sent is totally different."
5,Nice and Clean,"I have several Sandisks, and this brand (new to me) compares favorably. It is about 1/2 inch shorter, not that it matters that much. It is also a bit fatter, so if you have this thing in a USB slot and something else in a neighboring slot, it kind of smushes up against the other one, but they will both still fit. The lanyard it comes with is a woven steel cable in a clear plastic housing. Honestly, I have never seen the reason for putting a flash drive on a lanyard, so I suggest you use it for something else.Very good thing: this thing comes without nag screens, pre-installed software, U3 whatever. The memory is entirely clean and empty. For this reason alone, I think in the future all of the flash drives I buy will be this brand.PostscriptThis little thing safely went through the clothes washer in a pocket. I took off the cap and let it dry out for 2 days. Good as new."
4,Where the heck did Ricky Lee Jones go???,"This is another nostaglia purchase for me. I remember when this album came out, and how every one was abuzz with how great Ricky Lee Jones' voice was, and how different she was to the music scene. The album has 2 really great songs on it, that I remember distincly, Chuck E's in Love and Danny's all-star joint, were played all the time on the radio. The other songs are nice, but I find myself skipping over them. She was a hit, then she was gone.......so I ask you.....where the heck did Ricky Lee Jones go??????"
3,Slightly disappointed...but not a bad album.,"Somehow I've never managed to own this album over the years even though I've owned and enjoyed a few other RLJ albums most notably ""The Magazine"", ""Flying Cowboys"" and my personal favorite, ""Pirates"". I found this one on vinyl for only $3 and since I'm still a big time vinyl nut I grabbed it.I was not disappointed in the sound quality as it's one of the best sounding pop recordings I've ever heard but the material was only decent compared to the other RLJ I've heard.Last Chance Texaco is a beautiful song , Easy Money and Danny's All-Star Joint are a lot of fun, and the supporting studio musicians are right on point throughout but I can't say this album grabbed me from start to finish the way I was expecting it to.This is certainly not a bad album but it's now the least favorite of my four RLJ albums that I own."
1,Very disappointed,The item description for this book is misleading. Even the book cover is misleading--it does NOT contain 8 complete stories. It contains 6 complete stories and one chapter each from Homer Price and Centerburg tales... so much for all of McCloskey's previously published works.
3,Incomplete,"I bought this hoping to replace the battered dog-eared ripped-to-bits copy of Homer Price my children have just loved to death, and sadly it only contains one of the six stories from that book -- so I'm buying another copy of Homer Price after all. But this volume has lots of great stuff in it, and McCloskey is a genius, and it's worth the price. (No pun intended.)"
2,It's Still Amazes Me!,"When I was young and still in school, the people who wrote books on difficult subjects were EXPERTS in what they did. Rarely was someone only fair at their skills and had a ego to go out and advertise themselves as ""professional"". This book suggests that it is: ""The Complete Guide . . ."" and it is nothing of the sort. The book does have some pretty women inside, and a few interesting comments and shots, but all in all this book comes up short when it comes to a ""guide"". Little is shown in how an image is created, but more than that the images themselves are very average at best. Most of us who would buy a ""glamour book"" are visually sophisticated, and I dare to say, that unless you are an absolute beginner with no knowledge in glamour photography, most likely this book will teach you little and completely disappoint you with it's artistry!"
4,the friend,A detailed and involved account. Have patience while reading. It is worth the time and effort. The world is not as simple as it seems.
3,I need it stronger,"I bought these because of the reviews at drugstore.com.I just had 3 fillings done in preperation to a temporary crown which I got 2 days ago.Past two weeks left side of my face have been aching in pain, so Ive been taking two vicodins every four hours.The vicodin isnt working anymore#%#$% I get huge headaches,one night I was crying rolling around at night because I couldnt sleep.Anyways back to Zilactin- its helped a little bit for me but ice works 5* better"
1,Sverall serious flaws,"A book with a welcome and correct message (invest globally) but with many grave flaws, among them: (a) an entirely deceptive discussion of long term vs. short term risk, (b) an embarrassingly wrong, obviously biased discussion of index funds, (c) a false and unnecessary critique of capitalization weighted stock indices, (d) the absence of any discussion of fund costs and their enormous impact on long term net returns, (e) a dubious restatement of the old myth that past performance is a useful guide to select a mutual fund, (f) a misleading book title which should actually read ""Getting started in Global STOCK FUND Investing"" for no other investment vehicles are discussed, (g) a completely useless table of contents that seems to relate to some kid adventure novel rather than this book. Overall: Two thumbs down."
2,Disappointing,"This book dangles the possiblity of completely explaining Data's origin, including why there are no other androids made. Instead, it confuses things further by entangling him in complex plot with three different factions fighting over a new android.There is just too much that you have to accept on faith in this story. E.g. that Data would have the authority to shut down an entire planet's computer network, or that life pods would have warp drives, or that two people could infiltrate changeling-paranoid Starfleet that easily. People keep popping out of the woodwork and explaining what's going on in huge expository chunks.We also get the Trek cliche of a new crewmember a regular character falls in love with, but must leave at the end of the story. It could also do with being at least 20 per cent shorter to speed up the pace and get rid of extraneous stuff.Data deserves a better story than this. And for that matter, what's the story behind Mudd's androids?"
3,Kinda disappointed,"Well it arrived, as described and fits well in my Buick Rainier, but its very cheaply made. Had it been a little heavier duty it would have received 5 stars, but its really cheaply made."
3,GOOD FOR STUDENTS AND AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGISTS,"This book tends to focus on American Archaeology, especially the American Southwest. It is well written and informative but in many places is very dry. Overall, this is a good text for a classroom."
1,This product did not work.,"We attempted to assemble this product for a class demonstration. A college teaching assistant carefully followed all directions, but this product did not work."
3,Metric & inches,"I bought this product because it has centimeters also! I'm not a student nor a heavy user. It does the job. After few months, it chipped a bit from one side (my fault) but it has a good metal edge on the inches side."
5,Gorgeous handmade product!,"My husband is the one who wanted this and he hasn't taken it off since he received it in Iraq. We both love that it looks like it was handmade and has almost 'hammer-like' marks on it, which give it more definition."
3,Not quite there,"While there are moments in several of the stories where the readerwill say 'yes!' or 'that's what I've been trying to articulate,' thesemoments do not make a satisfying book.The stories are interestingstudies of men in bad circumstances. However, they run much too longto hold the reader's attention without interruption. The plights arenotable, but the characters lack qualities that allow you to empathizewith them. You find yourself wondering why the author didn't allowsomething good to happen (by luck or by sheer force of will on thepart of the character) to prevent some of the stories from havingwhiny lead characters. I read this book on the bus, and often foundmyself becoming more interested in freeway traffic than thestories.After reading this book, reading additional titles by thisauthor is not high on my priority list."
4,"Great album, amazing.","I recently rediscovered Happy Chichester. I remember him from Howlin Maggie, and was surprised to learned that he is now a very acomplished solo artist. This album is full of surprises, very different musical styles - anything but boring. I've been listening to it for weeks. Can't wait for the upcoming album which will be releasen in spring."
1,Don't waste your money,"I am a real Noah Gordon fan. The Physician (Cole) and Shaman (Cole) were wonderful. This is drivel. I can't believe it was written by Gordon. The characters are thin and unlikeable. The plot is implausible. The interjection of medical terminology is gratuitous, and the attempts to tie current events into a sappy love story fail miserably. I wish I hadn't purchased this book, and I am very disappointed in Gordon's writing. It lacks the depth and color of The Physician and Shaman, which kept me riveted to the story and the characters. I honestly think Gordon just felt he should write something about a woman physician for a change, so he created this debacle. He obviously doesn't understand women's motivations, and certainly can't write about women's feelings. It was melodrama all the way. I hesitated to give it even one star."
1,A few more dollars down the drain.,"The one thing I would have liked to know before purchasing this book is that it is Choices with a different title. Both books had different copyright dates, so I thought maybe Mr. Gordon decided to continue his story with a 4th book. Well wasn't I surprised when I started reading Matters of Choice?"
2,Pales in comparison to previous two in triology,"A serious let-down after reading the first two in this series. Before any of the characters could be developed or understood well, the book ends."
5,Much needed book on a difficult subject,"Being a student and while working parttime i academia i have for some time been apalled by how the university diciplines really suck when it comes to presenting the social reality in a way as to empower democratic citizenship.The undemocratic nature of, and history behind the body of knowledge that is given legitimazy by academia is well uncovered in this book."
3,3.5 stars.......,"On this album Prince has not quite tapped the full potential of his talent (that would come one year later). The 2nd album shows that Prince hadn't mastered the ballad yet (When Were Dancing Slow and Close is really not that great). But, he did come out with some excellent pop. Most of the excellent tracks are available on the Hits vol. 1 and 2. The one track that is not available on those disks is Bambi which features some of Prince's most ferocious guitar playing. I also really like the solo on Why You Want Treat Me So Bad. Other than that I think this disk is average. The neophytes might want to stay away in favor of Dirty Mind, Sign O the Times and Purple Rain. But, if you'd like to dig a little deeper into this great artist's catalog, this would be a great place to start!"
4,Prince..,"You have to prepare yourself for OLD Prince...this is not quite the same kind of music as 1999...however, if you are a die hard fan like I am, you will love this...mellow, but funky...all around good."
4,This is where it's at...,"...as far as Prince is concerned.This 1979 record is a full demonstration of the genius of the then 20 some year old musician who,in one brilliant musical stroke, laid the foundations not only of his stellar career,but also those of a decade of pop.Funky,elemental,penetrated by an instinctual undercurrent missing from a lot of contemporary output,this is an epoch-making recording."
4,YEAH THAMAN GOT THIS CLASSIC!!!,MY BEST AN FOREMOST FAVORITE 70'S SONG OF ALL TIME...HAND'S DOWN IS...IF YOU THINK IM SEXY!!!
2,Doesn't Match Up with the Title,"Rod Stewart had charted 20 singles when this CD was put out, and in retrospect, the 10 chosen for the album simply don't hold up well. ""Maggie May"" is the only genuine hit released between 1971 - 6 that makes it onto the CD, leaving out such popular favorites as ""Reason to Believe,"" ""I Know I'm Losing You,"" ""You Wear It Well,"" ""Twisting the Night Away,"" and ""This Old Heart of Mine."" But that's just one problem: Rod's biggest hit ever, ""Tonight's the Night (Gonna Be Alright),"" is trimmed down considerably, ousting the French whispers supplied on the original version by Britt Ekland. Also, some non-top 40 tracks somehow made the cut: ""Sailing"" and ""I Don't Want to Talk About It,"" which are fine, but certainly not worthy enough to be on a CD bearing this title. Dedicated Rod fanatics should get the originals."
1,Problem Sound Quality,"The songs and content of the CD are fine. The sound quality is extremely poor. If this CD is playing with others, the sound will have to be significantly adjusted between it and the next CD playing."
4,Show Me Those Legs Rod!,"Rod Stewart has evolved throughout the last 30 years to be the consumate performer. At over 50 years of age, he still has it & delivers a gritty sensual driving performance. These tracks are well mixed and bring back memories as well as make new ones. My teen sons even like him! With this CD on your system--""Tonights The Night""--every night.A great additon to any ""best of collection"" Thanks--CDS"
2,"Honestly, I was very disappointed","I watched this movie after I read so many positive reviews. But honestly, I wasn't impressed at all by the film.At least the script was well written, but I felt as if the theme & message of the plot line was nothing new. I'm a straight woman and I can tell that the issue of actors and actresses hiding their sexuality to keep their mainstream popularity is a topic that's been discussed ad nausea by the gay population. Also, there were a couple of instances in the film where there was too much dialogue and not enough progression of the plot.The roles were played well by leads Montgomery and Callahan, but their on screen chemistry came up short. That was very surprising given the fact that they are partners in real life. Their interaction didn't look or feel natural. I wish there was more story line about the development of their relationship; it just kinda flew by without the viewer understanding more about them."
4,What happens in Palm Springs .... is worth a look,"This film does have a lot going for it right out of the gate, with a fine director, great cast, wonderful setting and beautiful cinematography. But, as many of the reviewers have noted, there are a lot of slow, talky stretches, where our characters seem obliged to deliver polemical treatises that do not sound like any honest-to-goodness dialogue that you could image real people saying in a situation like this. Don't get me wrong: I appreciated that the writer tried to present weighty issues and flawed characters dealing with true-to-life dilemmas. And I do not fault the actors in their delivery of these diatribes. Yet some judicious editing might have helped move the stoy along at a more reasonable clip, causing us viewers to yell at the screen less. I eagerly look forward to the next endeavor of this cast and crew, and so will you."
3,"Nothing in todays standards, but in 1994 it was the hit of the year","Doom has been on nearly ever system in the mid 90s. From SNES to N64, and this was a launch title for 32X. Something to get the consumers interested. Well this was the fastest(in terms of speed) version of the original DOOM. Though the Gensis buttons don't work well with it, it is still a great game to come with the system. It didn't that well, but still a history leason for those not around for the first 3D games/first person shooter."
5,Works Great!,Used in 2010 Toyota FJ with factory satellite ready audio deck. Easy and inexpensive install at Best Buy. Works great!
4,"Worked great, but can't pause","This unit works great with my AVH-P4000DVD and CD-SB10. It would be nice if I could pause and rewind though. Both the stereo and the CD-SB10 claim appear to support this feature, but it doesn't work with this radio. Still, I'm pleased."
4,Satellite adapter,"Research well, I had to purchase an additional part from Radio Shack $54.95 to make this work with my Kenwood receiver. Sirius and XM have merged, however if you own radios for both of them you do not get a multiple radio discount."
1,Bought this...and let it sit in the corner of my room for a year.,"Finally after I installed it, I then called Sirius...well needless to say Satellite radio is crazy expensive but whatever I tried it for a month. During that month I had more service interruption than I can count, if you don't have a completely clear sky above your car you will have problems: A tree will mess it up, A wire will mess it up, A cloud will mess it up, Rain forget about it...signal completely gone! I had several professional radio installation techs inspect and go over my hookup work and they said I installed it correctly yet it still failed to work properly. So I got tired of the problems cancelled my Sirius service after a month and dropped this off at Goodwill."
5,Wicked CD,"Wicked cd recomended to anyone who enjoys extreme music. Drummers will love the use of the ride cymbal in this cd, I rarely hear drummers use it like this! The session drummer is a good substitute for Nick Barker, and a wicked follow up album to In Defiance of Existance."
1,A Waste of Time,"I started watching this on TV last night...only because I couldn't WAIT to see this woman get her just desserts. The fact that she didn't makes you wonder if even those who made the movie were under her spell!Susan Lucci is NOT a good actress. Her helpless, wide-eyed sugary sweet smile (inflicted on everyone, even her daughter) is overdone, and her every gesture, every look, conveys her absorption with her own beauty. (And I do think she has the kind of glamor needed to play a seductress). I realize she was supposed to be ""putting on an act"" in the movie, but I got the impression that all this phony ""over-acting"" came a bit too naturally for her!This could have been a good movie if they had changed the ending and used an actress with a little more spice and a little less sugar.I have only myself to blame for getting sucked into it..."
2,Bland,"I would call myself a fan of Van Halen very loosely. Eddie Van Halen possesses an immense talent with the axe which makes him fun to listen to in the right situation. However, all the intensity, the drive, the focus that made their debut what it was, had already been drained out and watered down by their follow up. ""Beautiful Girls"" succeeds where most of the tracks on here don't, it is restrained, catchy, and smooth. Yet that fire that made song's like ""Ain't Talkin' Bout Love"" and ""Runnin' With The Devil"" on the debut so good was no longer there. It's not like this stopped them from getting more popular, but we don't have to pretend decades later like it's not overrated."
1,Not worth buying! ... Totally dissapointing!,"I heard this recording and sadly got to say, ""Almost Here"" Duett with Aussie Superstar Delta Goodrem as well as the solo Brian McFadden Tracks are totally uninspirational, totally depressing and dull typical of so many 08/15 ballads played in the media. Delta Goodrem sounds totally dominated by Brian McFadden, making the Duett totally stale, and uninspirational, not inline of Delta#s Style at all, more of a typical Brian McFadden Song. I sadly give this Maxi a 1 Star review underlining that this recording is not recommedable for profound Music Fans, hating stale melancholical songs as these. Very dissapointing!"
1,Unknown,I cannotv review because it still has not been received plus I did not want it sent to my address since it was a gift and it was difficult trying to make the changes. At this time the changes qwere still not made so I would not purchase magazines from Amazon again. Hopefully the magazine will be good and appreciated but my experience was not.
1,Foams too much,I bought this for the price - I guess you get what you pay for - this product foamed my pool for 7 days straight!
5,When Delta Green isn't enough,This book adds more to mix than found in the earlier Delta Green Book and will expand the RPG experience further. I would highly recommend buying this book after getting the core book for Delta Green. Expands the conspiracies outside of the United States in both enemies and allies. Much more disturbing than the groups in the original Delta Green book and adds different plot angles. Very well written and compelling. A must have the Delta Green enthusiast
3,Mildly Entertaining for Sherlock Holmes Fans,"After Sherlock Holmes supposedly died at Reichenbach Falls, newspaper reporter Josiah Cobbett decided to track down the elusive history of Holmes' early life. The results of his research was suppressed at the time, as Holmes was not really dead. The research was only recently rediscovered.From this excellent premise, the author has built a relatively good, but tragic story. Young Mycroft Holmes is a particularly strong and interesting character.One of my complaints is the poor usage of Victorian English. It makes for difficult reading and I personally found its usage unnecessary.It certainly cannot hold a candle to the original Holmes stories and devoted fans might be disappointed, but I still recommend this book to anyone interested in variations of Holmes stories."
3,Recovery is a process rather than a destination,Betsy Pertersen's story of childhood abuse by her father is a good entry-level story for those that are beginning their own recovery. This book is but a part of the author's own process; a work that would be an excellent compliment to on-going therapy for others.
4,Smooth,"Whoa! In a word SMOOTH! With guest appearances from NAS and Faith Evens, it's all good! From beginning to end it just get better. This is definitely a CD people are sleeping on. Don't let it pass you by, go cop it! The only disappointment will come from regretting not getting it sooner."
3,IT'S ALRIGHT.,"I HAVE TO SAY I WAS EXPECTING BETTER, BUT I GUESS I HAVE TO KEEP ON LISTENING 2 IT. I PUT IT ON, AND SOME SONGS I SKIPPED BECAUSE I WASN'T REALLY FEELING THEM. BUT FOR ANYBODY WHO JUST STARTED LIKING JON B, I RECOMMEND U GUYS GET HIS COOL RELAX CD, THAT IS THE BEST R&B CD, IN THAT CD I DON'T SKIP ANY SONGS. I WISH HE MADE MORE SONGS WITH 2PAC, BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE THE WAY NAS RAPS OR AZ, 2PAC AND JON B'S VOICE 2GETHER WERE AWESOME. I WAS EXPECTING SO MUCH BETTER WITH JON B. BUT THE CD IS GOOD 2 LISTEN TO RELAX, AND FALL ASLEEP WITH. DON'T GET ME WRONG I LUV JON B, HE IS MY ONE MY FAVORITE SINGERS, BUT I'M GOING TO LISTEN TO COOL RELAX MORE AND MORE, BECAUSE THAT IS THE BEST. I GUESS YOU GOT 2 KEEP ON LISTENING 2 THIS ALBUM, IF YOU REALLY LIKE IT OR NOT, GIVE IT A CHANCE. BUT IN HIS LAST CD, YOU PUT IT ON, AND YOU WILL ABOSUTLEY FALL IN LOVE WITH IT. I LUV U JON B, LET YOUR NEXT ALBUM BE BETTER."
1,weak!,I don't have a Lot to say about as I gave It away after the first time I listed to It except come up with some fresh material.Its not even worth the used price they have on IT!
5,The Best,I'll keep this short and to the point. This is the best R&B album I've heard released in 2001. Jon. B.'s last album was excellent and he has exceeded that production with his current effort. This man is a very talented (see the album credits and his creative input) and fast rising star. Keep an eye on him in the future. Kudos to Tracy Edmonds for development. Jon B.'s album is considerably better than her famous husband's new project.
5,Must Have,I haven't finished it yet but I love it already! The techniques are easy to understand and are the types of tips which are usable every day. Its just a matter or practice and learning to remember the tips because there are so many! I find it an easy and enjoyable read. Definately recommended!
4,How do I turn this off?!,"After spending most of my adult life being somewhat shy and reserved, this book has really helped, and I haven't even gotten half way through it. Needless to say, all the basics have to be there, you have to have some level of self confidence and ability to talk to others, but these tips help you make the most of what you already have. Rome wasn't built in a day, though, and it will take some time to take full advantage of all the tricks Lowndes has to offer. After every conversation, I now evaluate how things went and what I forgot to do or what I could have done differently. Thanks Leil!"
5,Informative and also fun to read,"Leil has managed to write a book that teaches and at the same time is fun to read. Very good read and will change the way you look at communication and potentially change the way you communicate for life. Out of the 92 tricks, I thought about 70% of them were essential reading and able to be used regularly, about 20% worth knowing about but not essential, and only about 10% did I think were not too useful to me or I didn't fully agree with."
3,Too much is common knowledge,"Read it!!! It is ok. Most is common knowledge. Each chapter (92 chapters) is a different ""trick."" But most of these tricks are intiutively understood by 5th grade. Like one for example was she said try not to take so much attention to people when they make mistakes. She said she one was out to dinner with 3 important business executives and their waitress dropped a tray right in front of them and these men took no notice of the situation because they were polite. OOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHH. What secretive knowledge thank goodness I have this book. There is a few good ones but not worth the money. Worth the read if you get this book at a salvation army, but nothing extraordinary in this book unfortunately."
4,Great read on the go,"It's a great read and it has fun memorable catch phrases for steps to remember..i find myself more consciously aware of the things i say to get people going and with that in mind, you get more comfortable starting or continuing any conversation."
4,Very Helpfull!,"I've been in retail all my life and dealing with customers is a cinch and I'm able to do quite well. BUT when it came to relationships, or simply talking to people at gatherings, I felt so AWKWARD, and I usually just shied away. (Pretending to be busy on the phone always helped). In the first few tricks I felt I could talk to anyone,.. Really!! I even gave a copy to my daughter who's somewhat like me. I do need to practice a lot, but these 'tricks' are even fun to try.One example is eye contact. Many people may know about it, but I hardly ever did eye contact. In fact, my wife used to call me ""dancing eyes"" because I would never make eye contact with anyone. Now I'm determined to make eye contact even if I have to keep a rubber eyeball in my pocket! I've been trying it and I've gotten surprising results. Why did I not read it before!For someone as 'extremely' shy as I am, this is a great book!"
5,Great tips for new moms!,I am a new mom-to-be and feel like all those natural instincts people talk about don't really apply to me. The ABC's CD really helped me get an understanding of the basics - I love that there's a resource like this! It's so helpful to have a wide range of topics to help me through this new stage!
3,Matt Houston,"I had not seen this show since it was cancelled. It was fun to see them again. I hope they release the other two Lee Horsely shows that were on,namely Paradise and Hawkeye. They are so much better than the shows on today."
2,Some TRACK LISTINGS would have been nice....,"I can't help but wonder why you are not giving potential customers some info regarding what is on this disc. How many tracks are there? What musical genre is it? Help us out a bit here. I LOVE the Moody Blues, but have virtually no info about the stuff the band members did as solo artists. Also, you don't mention whether or not this is a boot-leg. Wasn't THRESHOLD the label all of the band members used after they started their own label? Some good old-fashioned honesty --- you know - ""Truth in Advertising"" --- would be a good thing."
4,Memphis Flash,I purchased this item as a Christmas gift for my husband so I am unable to give a review at this time. Sorry. W. Cooper
1,Annoyed,"Got the device on time. But it won't work on my or my wife's laptop. It says my USB does not have enough power. This despite the fact that the hard drive package says no extra power needed. I'll now have to order a powered cable just to get the thing to work. It's not the end of the world but it means extra money and delay. In short, if you are getting this hard drive to use with a laptop be prepared to spend an extra 20 on a powered cable."
5,7th Heaven,I have enjoyed all of the eposides it seem true to live and is portrayed in a feel good manner It helps to learn things to use with your own children
4,"I have the other seasons and like this one, too.","I really liked the Christmas message, when Danny told Rev. Cannon that she was going to convert to Christianity. It carries on in the great tradition of family values."
5,One of the BEST shows ever,"I have been watching 7th Heaven for years, I have seen every episode repeatedly. My favorite character is Lucy, I can relate to her in so many ways. but I love everyone on the show, they all have their own personalities. I was so sad to see the show end, I grew up watching 7th Heaven and I consider it one of my top favorite shows."
1,Sexist piece of trash.,"Juanita Bynum is over-the-top ridiculous in ""No More Sheets,"" especially in the masturbation section. I can't believe she insinuates that masturbating will make women believe they don't need a man. She also says unlike women, men should carry the heavy stuff into the house. And according to Juanita Bynum, she started acting ""less lady-like"" and started dressing unclassy when she began masturbating. How does being a woman have anything to do with dressing nicely?This book is damaging to a woman's identity. To all the women out there: there's nothing wrong with having sexual feelings. It's normal and healthy. Please read a book on culture and sex and the different views people have of sexuality. Juanita Bynum is just stuck to the American cultural view of sex."
2,Boring,"It took me nearly a month to read ""the Paradise Snare."" I just kept putting it down. I love the ""Star Wars"" genre, and I have read--and enjoyed--most of the further adventures of the saga, but this book didn't ""grab me"" the way the other SW books have.I just think the book was too predictable, and the relationship story-line concerning Bria was dull."
5,NIRVANA - The best band in the world ever,I was very excited to read about the release a few months back. Received my copy from amazon yesterday. WOW. it's even better than the first time i've seen it on tv when they had a nirvana specila a few years ago.Watching this dvd I wished I could have gone to at least one live show. Nirvana never came our way. Can imagine if they did tour South-Africa.Every show would have sold out and people would have gone nuts. DAMN. now i feel like moshing.Still one more release that i'm WISHING for: Unplugged in New York.COME ON RECORD LABEL PEOPLE.NIRVANA FOREVER!!!!!!!!!!
5,Amazing,this is a wonderful video that shows what NIRVANA really was....3 guys who liked to play hard and fast....remember kurt cobain...67-94. -sil-
5,Kurt Cobain On Drugs.....?!?,some songs on this dvd kurt sings and acts like he is on drugs....this is a good dvd for huge nirvana fans like myself.....there is some bus songs live in amsterdam :)
5,A Nirvana fan,"This is one of my favorite videos of all time. I agree with all of the people that stress the point that this needs to be on DVD as well. There isn't anything that I don't like about this video, but I liked Polly, Come As You Are, and Smells Like Teen Spirit (more funny because Kurt, Dave, and Chris's performance). I also like when the people dive off the stage expecting to crowd surf, but instead fall into a big hole. Stupid, but funny. Anyways, this video is great, bottom line. If you're a Nirvana fan, GET THIS VIDEO!!! Doesn't matter how you get it, just go NOW!"
1,A failure,This book fails in virtually every respect. The language is flat. The meter and rhyme are awkward. The sexual stereotyping in the second half is offensive. The anti-television message is overly pedantic.
3,Tasty but salty,"Very easy to fix with a can of tomatoes and some chicken, pork or shrimp. The seasonings are flavorful and the rice cooks up nicely, unlike instant rice which has an odd extruded look and feel. It is quite salty though - more salty than I like. I have been using sodium free tomatoes and, of course, not salting the water. I will eat the boxes I have but will not order more due to the excessive salty taste."
2,Not as pictured; costs too much,"Out of all the available retractable lanyards, I chose this particular gear-retractor because it is shown without split-rings. Split rings are the weak link in these lanyards. It's also a bit more expensive to manufacture without split rings, and that - to me - justified the $20 price.What I received has two split rings, one on the stationary end and another on the extendable end.At this time - 2/26/2013 - every photo of this item shown on Amazon.com pictures a gear-lanyard with no split rings.Geez! Can't we order anything online and get what we believe we'll get? This is supplied by a third party vendor, guaranteed by Amazon, so I don't hold Amazon itself accountable, but still... Geez!These are far, far too expensive for what you receive. Cannot recommend them."
2,Cable ripped right out of the reel,"I was initially very pleased with this product. It seemed more durable and better made than any other badge reel I had tried. However, the internal spring loaded retention reel started sticking after about 60 days of daily use. Eventually, my ID would hang with more slack than I would like if I weren't careful. One day, I had about 6 inches of unnoticed slack, and my id hooked on a seat belt. When I got out of my car, the ID stuck and the cable popped out of the reel with no way to reinstall it.I have give up on badge reels, and I now just keep my ID in my pocket. I have tried everything and I can't find anything I can wear with business clothes that is in any way durable. I have seen other reels that would probably hold up, but I don't want to look like I have a janitor's key chain on my belt when I go to meet with clients."
2,quaint but tedious,"Looked through the book, started reading but gave it up after awhile. It's a nice novelty item but the writing is predictable. The foreshadowing is a bit heavy-handed especially the psychological stuff.My greatest disappointment is this is a book I saw years ago and wished I had bought but the anticipation was greater than the real thing. Ain't that always the way?"
1,Money Makin Ploy,"It's all about Benjamins, Cappa didn't make this album for the people, he did it for the money. From ""The Pillage"" 5 stars, to ""The Yin and the Yang"" 1 star. I gave it one star for effort. Nobody deserves O stars. This is the height of commercial rap.All I'd like to say is ""Bring That Beat Back."" Cappadonna could of done better."
2,Another No Banger,"I'm just gonna put it bluntly from the beginning: this album is not very good. I won't say that it [isn't good at all] because there's a few decent beats throughout the cd. However, the first flaw is that there's only 10 f'in songs and not enough quality to make up for lack of quantity. Second of all, I haven't been a fan of Cappa's lyrics since his appearances on Ghost's first album. I don't know what happened to him but since then he just lost his flow. Unfortunately, it seems that he still hasn't found it. In fact, most of the guests he had on the album (excluding J.D. and Da Brat) sounded better than he did and quite frankly made him sound worse than he already does. Overall I wouldn't recommend this album to Wu-fans or others."
4,THE CAPPACHINO KID IS BACK!!!!,"FIRST OF ALL THIS ALBUM IS BANGIN'....CAPPA HAS CAME BACK STRONG FOR SURE...RZA DIDN'T SHOW UP ON THIS ONE BUT HE DID RECRUIT MY MAN TRUE MASTER(PERSIA LEGACY) ON THE HIT SUPER MODEL''....AND 8-OFF AGUILAR IS NOT A NEW CAT HE HAS BEEN DOWN WITH THE HIT SQUAD FOR YEARS, I'M SURE EVERYBODY REMEMBERS DAS EFX...SO TO ME THE ALBUM IS A HIT AND IT WON'T SELL OFF THE WU-LOGO...IT'S CAPPADONNA AT HIS BEST AND HE'S GETTING BETTER....WELCOME TO UNCLE TOM RAP PEOPLE...ONE LOVE TO MY MAN CAPPA."
2,Required reading for a course...now a dust collector,I wouldn't have bought this after skimming it prior to the course. It's so repetitive and tries so hard to be one of those feel good organizational development books that just repeats what many of the other books out there are already saying. This really could have been a 30 page powerpoint.
1,No way to treat your intelligent audience,"Big disappointment. It reads as if the author, having gotten this great IDEA for a novel--and it IS a great idea--spent a few days jotting it down and sold it. If the plot were brilliant, you might forgive the implausible characters. If the characterizations were illuminating, you might forgive the implausible plot. If the prose were fantastically witty you might forgive everything. But *No Way* falls short by every measure. I picked it up because Buckley's essays in *Wry Martinis* are funny and smart. Wish I'd stuck to his essays."
2,Grab your tin pan & chisel!!,"I eagerly bought this novel expecting his well-worded wit to keep me laughing from beginning to end. Not so. I gave up somewhere around chapter 21. There is only so much a man can take. I now know what gold-miners went through in the 1800's! Tedious, laborious work that only produces a few nuggets. Life is too short. For example, Christopher's use of the word ""delicious"" to describe a scene was hilarious the first time around. The second time, the word lost its original luster. The third time, I wished he hadn't used it the first time.Another reason I quit reading the book is that the plot is not strong enough to hold my interest without his steady dose of barbs...Buyer beware!"
4,"witty, quick-moving, political farce","Buckley's ridicule of trial attorneys and politicians is hilarious and apt but never bitter. This is a very enjoyable read, as was his _Thank You for Smoking_."
5,Laugh Out Loud Funny,"Buckley does it again! What a funny book. He artfully skewers lawyers, politicians, and the media. I couldn't put it down."
5,Biblical wisdome,A must have for encouragement and practical wisdom to wait on the Lord's timing in all facets of life. Item came quickly and was in excellent condition. Very pleased with the order. I appreciate used books to save for those who read a lot. :o)
1,Mostly Christian BS,"I enjoyed the beginning of this book very much since I am submitting my will to that of God as I understand Her. But then the book degenerated into the kind of Christian BS that it took me years to get out of my mind. I usually have great respect for books but this one offended me so much that I destroyed it. If you're not blinded by Christianity, then avoid this book."
5,The Best Ever,"My sister and I used to sing and play along with this album in 1980 - it is still a favorite inside joke for us. I can't wait to get this CD for her this Christmas and my own son. This is a very unique, diverse CD - with lots of fun songs and beautiful music. It is sure to be a treasure for all families - no matter what the age. Buy it now!!!"
5,i had this album when i was a little kid!,"this is a great album! i want a horse was one of my favorite songs when i was little. actually looking at the release date, i was born 2 months after this album came out... i have great memories of dancing around to all of these songs and singing the final, ""in harmony"" song, probably out of harmony but that's okay. the pajamas song as well as the doobie brothers, wynken, blynken and nod make me feel like a kid again. you simply must buy this album! it's great!"
4,My favorite...,"This is one of my favorite classical CD's. It is a composition of soft, calmer Bach, and is perfect for almost any occassion. This is a great CD for first time classical listeners or long time fans ... It functions as perfect dinner background music, or to listen to alone. I highly recommend this compilation of Bach."
5,properly functioning and money saving,"I bought this for my old Olympus digital camera which was eating up AA batteries too quickly. New AA batteries only lasted for 10-12 photos, and the rechargeable AA batteries for only 5-7 photos. This new CRV3 rechargeable lithium battery (when fully charged) lasts all day (about 30+ photos) until being recharged at night that I never have to carry extra emergency batteries."
3,Nothing Special,"I am surprised at the amount of positive responses Rocky Athas has got.I am also surprised that the name ""Eric Clapton"" has not been uttered, as there is a similarity in the vocals there. But, in my opinion, the vocals are more akin to Canadian Blues guitar merchant ""John Campbelljohn"" and little known Essex (England) guitarist ""Clive Mulcahy"". In all cases, the vocals are tedious with no passion in there. The guitar work is competent and well produced, but I have heard it all before. The music is a mixture of straight out Texan Blues to slow blues to the occasional Acoustic Blues and the odd ""poppy"" one. I would advise you to check out the CDs by John Campbelljohn first and then judge my thoughts. Voodoo Moon is in similar style to this one. To sum it up, in the U.K., he would'nt get past the Pub Circuit."
4,Great read,"Fun, full of twists, turns and laughs. Like Stephanie Plum meets a character from. Grissom or Baldachj. I look forward to reading more Levine books."
3,PRETTY GOOD LIGHT READ,"The book is a mixture of comedy, thrills and romance.The story is interesting, although the ending is predictable and ordinary."
4,Holds your interest.,"Takes a few pages to get into the book although once you are into it, your interest is held. So many twist and turns to the story. A great read."
4,"A different, darker entry","At 352 pages, Kill All the Lawyers is the shortest Solomon vs. Lord book, but like the other two, it is expertly paced. I don't think it could get more harrowing, with ""Dr. Bill"" Kreeger turning Steve's every good intention against him in a bid to tear apart his life with Victoria and Bobby.One mark of great characters is the range of stories they allow you to tell, from lightly comedic to absolutely grave. I'm right there with them."
3,"Weakest of the series, but an escapist quick read","I loved the first two books in the Solomon vs. Lord series, and absolutely love Steve Solomon's voice, so it is with much distress that I give this one a resounding ""meh.""Feels like Paul Levine has phoned this series in just to please the publisher and is ready to move on from these characters. It just doesn't have the punch and pizazz of the first two in the series. If you've enjoyed the first two books (""Solomon vs Lord"" and ""Deep Blue Alibi""), you'll still enjoy Solomon's quick wit and disdain for following any rules that aren't his, but you'll immediately feel how tired the joke has become.If you've never read any in this series, I suggest you skip this one and start at the beginning. You may come to this one eventually, but I wouldn't put it high on your to-do list."
4,"Not literary genius, but readable","More like Applebee's than Morton's Steakhouse. A little bit page-turny, but not Robert B. Parker. In all ways superior to most romances."
2,SHALLOW WATERS,"Received this from a client, hopefully as a joke.This tale is definitely mass market reading matter. It is a fast read, it is also cartoonish, and the legal parts of it are stuff and nonsense.It is extraordinarily difficult to write a legal thriller and a sitcom at the same time, and Levine proves the difficulty by failing to pull it off.The fact that it is popular is no surprise. Nobody ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the public. Of course, being a solo practitioner in the field of criminal and divorce law, my viewpoint might be somewhat different.Kreeger is a watered down Hannibal Lecter, (all fava beans no chianti), and the plot isn't Cape Fear,it's more like Cape Feh! Solomon's father is a borscht belt sketch, and his love interest is more Victor than Victoria.If you're waiting at the imaging center for a colonoscopy, this will help pass the time. If you are looking for real legal thrillers, try Grisham and Turow."
3,indecisive,Not a bad film but the director/screen-writer should have decided on its genre before producing it. It seems to be moving into being a dramatic/ action film but pulls into a thoughtful drama that does not synchronise somehow.
3,Lanechanger wide view blind spot mirror,"Great for seeing all those blind spots - only problem I found is that it hides the directional/temp signs if those are on your rearview mirrors... Other than that, it works great!"
1,American Ferrets,I noticed that because Sharon LaCouture did not like my review I left at this site she had it removed. I will find it hard to trust this site if they remove the reviews that are not in favor of the books they sell.
3,Heart & Anger,"What we have here is a solid work of melodic speed metal with a progressive touch. It's very typical for the genre and lacks variety. If you are not specifically into this kind of progressive speed metal it will sound very samish and booring despite it's quality.I personally liked the vocalist Secret Sphere used for their first two albums better than this guy but this guy is definitely servicable. I have not heard this album more than a few spins but I am confident their second album ""A Time Nevercome"" shall remain my favorite of thiers as I feel it has stronger songwriting with more variety.All in all I am certainly satisfied with the release but it does nothing to distinguish itself in such a crowded genre."
4,Great band! Great tunes!,"Midget are a top band and very talented too! This album is great, and I highly recomend it to those of you who like powerful poppy punk tracks with great catchy melodies and harmonies. I didn't give this a five star rating because it is not quite as good (in my opinion) as some of there older singles e.g. ""Kylie and Jason"" and ""Camouflage"". Even so this is a brilliant album from a band who SHOULD be massive.U MUST SEE THIS BAND LIVE!"
5,amazing!,"I recently became a pediatric cardiac intensive care nurse. I never really understood what it was like to be a family, or cardiac surgeon until reading this book. It is so amazing that someone could write such as informational insiring book, that has no health background. It makes me proud to be a nurse for this type of unit."
3,Insightful...but a warning about the profanity,"I, too, am one of those parents who are living this life. My son has had 3 open heart surgeries to correct his congenital heart condition (HLHS). Therefore, I was eagerly waiting to read this book. While the book was insightful, I was dismayed by the amount of profanity the author used. I realize this is ""real life"", but it seemed that if a doctor, nurse, or anyone else the author interviewed used any type of profanity, he or she was quoted in the book. I found that disappointing. I read the reviews before purchasing this book, and this aspect was never mentioned. I thought a warning should be given to those who are considering purchasing this book and would find this offensive. I know I did."
2,Would be great without the vulgar profanity,"I found the book extremely interesting but could not get past the horrible swearing. It wasn't the occasional d word, but much worse and vulgar swear words that I found very offensive. For me it really took away from the story. Reality doesn't need to be peppered with vulgarity to be effective, it doesn't make it any more intense or scary. It was interesting to see another family's journey with TGA, ours was much different, unfortunately I gave up trying to wade through the muck and quit reading after the 3rd chapter. So for those of you who find profanity offensive, watch out!"
3,Loved the first two-thirds,"Even though I didn't understand a lot of what was going on, I loved the first two-thirds of the book. I loved the stories about children who were sick and dying and needed heart surgery. I loved the stories about the doctors who worked on the children. Then the story switched to a history of heart surgery in the world and I grew less interested. By the time I got back to the stories of the children, I found myself much less interested in what was going to happen."
3,not the best guide,"this really isn't the best guide for documentary filmmaking. especially if your goal is to create an independent project. i wanted a ""step 1, step 2. step 3..."" guide. this was not it. also, the author's bias is toward behavioral documentaries, for profit."
4,happy with shoe,Got these shoes to wear to work. I put out stock at a grocery store so I am on my feet all day. I find these shoes to be comfortable and true to size. I have a narrow foot so it is sometimes hard to find a well-fitting shoe. I only wish I could get them in black in my size.
1,never got video,yes I ordered this video in August and was to receive it by Sept.9 never came in mail I called Amazon and they said the video was recalled but yet the person I ordered it from keeps telling me it is in the mail I stopped at post office and they said it was never dropped off at your end but I was still charged for it and nothing returned on my credit card So what is the problem
2,kinda goofy,"This movie was not as good as I had hoped. There are two main women in this movie - one is extremely hot, the other just so-so. There is a little bar maid that I wish I had have seen more of - she was in a brief gir/girl scene but unfortunatly one of the doofus actors cut in and made it an uninspired threesome. Do not buy it....rent it instead."
1,American import,Why do Amazon sell DVD's recorded on NTSC and thus won't play on PAL players? It was a complete waste of money..never again!!!!...ps it's too much trouble sending it back
4,Only English Subtitles! No Portuguese or Spanish Subtiltes!,I'm very upset when I discovered that this 8th Season (and the next?) does not have portuguese and spanish subtitles!
5,Its the best watch I've ever own. For the money its the best watch ever made. Looks great and Very functionable.,Its the best watch I've ever own. For the money its the best watch ever made. Looks great and Very functionable.
3,"Accessible, Thought-Provoking","The title is misleading - the essay that addresses ""the Sun, the Genome and the Interent"" is only a small part of this short book. I found it the most interesting, though, which is probably why it is thus titled. Dyson paints a future world in which villages are repopulated through solar power processed by bio-engineered trees (which will provide the fuel), and the Interent (which will provide the connection to the larger world). A very simple, elegant idea. He addresses other issues here, too - the role of ethics in science, how to get into space cheaply, and the coming changes due to biotech. The biotech portion was very compelling, with speculation that we will soon be re-enigneering the human race. I have read such predictions before but Dyson does a good, thoughtful job here, and examines the implications.All in all, a good, economical book of lectures which you will finish quickly."
4,Insightful!,"Think of this book as an engaging evening with a rather authoritarian dreamer who happens to be a distinguished scientist. Based on a series of lectures delivered at the New York Public Library in the late 1990s, the book rambles through a variegated terrain of technology, history, ethics, philosophy and family pride. It is about thinking more than it is about ideas, about wondering more than it is about thinking. Jules Verne and H.G. Wells figure prominently in the bibliography, but so do serious historians of science. We [...] recommend this slender and elegantly written book for everyone with an interest in science and a sense of the marvelous."
3,Ho Hum,"Sandy is young adult who loves basketball and hanging with his friends. The only problem is none of his friends are human. Aliens found him as an infant and raised him as they slowly crossed from Earth to Alpha Centauri and back to Earth at sub-light speeds. In the meantime, the rest of humanity has more or less destroyed themselves through war, famine, nuclear power, AIDS, global warming, Styrofoam happy meal containers, and all the other things people worried about back in the 1980's. How will the rest of humanity react to Sandy? And are the aliens really friendly?This book is very readable and is mildly interesting. There is a good deal of suspense over whether or not the aliens really are friendly. However, the page after page of environmentalism gets old. Also, the ending is a pretty weak. All in all, it's a decent book to pick up if you read a lot of Sci-Fi and want a quick read."
3,Not so great.....,"in fact, it was pretty boring. Sure, there were metaphors, but the characters were boring, and it was hard to care about what happened to them. And what was up with the wolf??? And why did Fabio and Paolo create the ""miracles""? What happened to the mute woman after she left the courthouse?? If you really want to read this, get it at the library....don't waste your money."
5,Innovative,"Beautifully presented, innovative recipes, amazing combinations of flavors that one would not normally consider. I have made a number of the recipes which have won rave reviews from my guests. I love cooking and eating and found these receipes easy to follow however to get the best results one really needs to use the freshest of ingrediants. Some recipes are a little more involved and need a trial run prior to trying them on guests. One of the best cook books I have seen for some time and I have quite a few. For those that really appreciate the best in food."

5,Brilliant.,"Beautifully made. Realistic. Exceptionally powerful. Just, indescribable. Watching this made me realize that the more I think I know about this world, the more I don't."
1,not for beginners,"I bought two sets, this ""Teach Yourself ..."" and ""Pimluer Swedish Learn To ..."" This one rapidly punges into moderately advanced lessons. The speaker pronounces words, but there is no pause for you to say it back and then hear it again. The pace is fast and unusable. I would suggest if someone spoke some Swedish, then this might be useful. For beginners, the Pimsleur is the way to go."
2,"Awful, expensive and slow service, wierd coat","I spend $10 shipping and handling for a FedEx delivery which took several days. The coat was just awful, an atypical design with a very broad bottom. I returned it, losing the $10 mailing cost and incurring a 10%restocking fee. Why did I pay $10 for such slow delivery? I will never order a jacket like this again!"
5,"yes, more praise","Once you have seen Happy Apple live, you are going to want everything they record. They have all of the ""right stuff"" needed to be considered excellent and important. All of the emotional responses art can generate in we humans is acheived. Genuine beauty."
1,Skips like Crazy.,The second half of this cd skipped like crazy and I wasn't informed about it before I purchased it.
2,Vivacious Lady,Who it may concern I return the video early September because it would not play and i have not receive credit for it . thank you Alfred Acosta
3,"Maybe not all you're looking for, but for the price.","This is not Kurowski's best translated work. I find infantry aces a tough read too. Perhaps it's the faux first person account, or adherance to stiff nondescript translation.The price says it all though. You could have paid six-fold for the hard cover edition by fedorowicz.Much better first hand accounts by authors such as Paul Carell, and Alex Buchner. Autobiographies by Manstein, Degrelle, Kesselring, and Goebbels give a far more accurate insight to the german phyche during WW2."
1,They are Missiong Songs from The Movie !,"I would say get this for the Song tommorow by Saif keta but the One song if you Watch the Flim very Closly was when Ali and his brother paid Jamie Fox a visit in the Hotel and Ali riding on the Train , That Track was By Johnny Farmer a Old school Blues song Called Death Letter , with Great vocals this song is not on Soundtrack ""why? It is the best song in the whole damn MovieI wonder where I can get it like it was song in the Movie ?if you know let me know !"
3,Good but difficult!,"US Government was the first AP course I ever took, and being first, I wanted to make sure I got a good grade on it. So I bought this book and began to study it about every day for a month before the AP test. However, I found the book very confusing in some parts. Most of the words they used you had to get a dictionary to even understand. The other criticism I have is that the practice tests and questions were way harder than on the actual test. I got what would be equivalent to a ""2"" (out of 5) on the book test while I got closer to a 4-5 on the actual test. Good book though, but I would definitely not reccomend you use it on its own to study for an AP Exam with -- use your textbook too!"
5,Circle Circle Circles,O you will really ENJOY this..It is so easy and FUN!! Fast too.. You will want them all..
3,Jon Stewart in another role,"I could see where this movie was trying to go. It had a Quintan Terrantino ""Pulp Fiction"" feel to it, but it didn't work.I really liked Jon Stewart's character, but they didn't get into his character enough. There is a movie out called ""Playing By Heart"" that has him in it and it has 4 different love stories that all intertwine together. If you want to check out Jon Stewart in a good romantic comedy you should check that movie out too.Overall I give this movie about a 3."
3,casper is vanishing,remember the last days of disco well this was from when funk'and soul were on life support as well first song is blazin but f-encounter starts off damn bootsy is reclaimin his funk then is that my song makes you wonder was bootsy that stressed about his stardom the rest is weak good thing george came back with computer games 2 years later
4,Sleek and sensational,"For those of us who never had the chance to see the broadway revival, this CD comes as a welcome treat. The story is of murder, mayhem, adultery, (dramatic music please). The CD is a bit incosistent, and it doesn't compare to the pure decadent brilliance of Cabaret, but this is an incredible Kander and Ebb Musical. Bebe Neuworth and James Naughton are absolutely magnificent. Ann Reinking tries quite hard, and sometimes her problem (she really is too nice), and Joel Grey is truly great.If I made a CD of the 20 best broadway tunes, The Cellblock Tango would be on the list. It is hialriously witty and very effective. Half the time, you're laughing or singing along.The musical originally was nominated for eleven tony awards, and lost them all (the same year A Chorus Line and Pacific Overtures). The revival won six, so you can see how this musical stood, and even overcame the test of time."
4,Amazing,"To start: I DETEST MUSICAL THEATER. When my friend dragged me kicking and screaming to the West Coast premiere of ""CHICAGO,"" I looked for any excuse not to go. Man, I was more than a little surprised at how much I actually enjoyed myself. Jasmine Guy gave a terrific performance and I found myself during intermission purchasing this CD. THIS CD IS DEFINATELY A WISE PURCHASE FOR ANYONE WHO HAS SEEN THE PRODUCTION OR ANYONE WHO WANTS TO. My favorites, just for the heck of it, is ""Cell Block Tango,"" ""All That Jazz,"" and ""Razzle Dazzle."" (Admittedly, the three most famous songs from ""CHICAGO."") I even catch myself humming them while I am stuck in traffic on the 405, in spite of myself. One more bit of praise, Bebe Neuwirth's singing will have you looking at ""CHEERS'"" Lilith in a whole new light."
3,Great Concert But..........,"Like other fans, I grew up listening to The Cure, most of there songs/albums reflect time periods in my life. I thought this concert was well done for being live. Video is excellent, sound quality is good but the way they recorded the individual band accoustic volume levels needed work. There are many songs as you know where Robert Smith's guitar should be more distinct or louder than the others. Each band member seemed to drown eachother out to create a loud mess of guitars playing at the same audio level. ""Same deep water as you"" and ""Plain Song"" are a perfect exsample of this. All in all, still a good DVD to purchase."
1,DEFECT,"This dvd is DEFECTIVE. Chapter 9 of the first disc is scrambled and not acceptable. The Cure should be ashamed for releasing this inferior product. Besides chapter 9, the rest of the dvd is good and is worth at least 4 stars."
5,Decent criminal justice book,"No, it's not a perfect book on the subject but so does other books. I think this is still a must-read, but not the only reading material, for anyone interested in the criminal justice field."
5,Great songs on Music & Lyrics!!!,"I loved the 80's pop included on this soundtrack-it remind me of Wham!-remember them? My favorite though is the song Hugh Grant and Drew Berrymore sing together, ""A way back into love"". I had to have this cd the moment after I saw the movie!!!"
2,DVD is scrached and skipping....,"I have only watched one and two and some of the episodes are skipping. You have to wait a long time for it to read and then it skips some parts. This is the first time I've had to write some negative things, and I have bought alot of the Waltons and Little House but this time is very different!!"
5,its the waltons alright,"I got this for my fiance, she loved it and so did her family. I'm not into this kinda stuff but if your looking for a good gift to get someone who likes this show and they already have season 1,2, and 3 then this should be a no brain-er."
3,The Kidnapping Saved the Book!!!,"Reforming a Rake was your typical book about the man of the house being forced to play protector of his aunt and cousin. Only Lucien REALLY seems to hate Rose and Fiona....not that I blame him because I didn't like Fiona either. So he engages the beautiful Alexandra (Lex) to help ""polish"" Rose's skills to win a husband. The only problem....Lucien falls for Lex and Fiona has her own designs on Lucien for Rose. What happens next is a funny, sometimes boring (hey I can't lie) tale of three women and one man. The part that saved the book was when Lucien kidnapped Lex and held her captive in his wine cellar and she got even with him by running his household staff all over creation to see to her comfort. Which made me laugh becuase that sounds like something I would do. All in all this book was good, but a little slow."
4,Good but not great,"I enjoyed this romance for the hero and not so much the heroine. She at first seem witty and nice but toward the end of the book I became annoyed that she loved him but didn't ever trust him till the last few pages of the book. I would have liked more time with the two charcters together, happy, and in love; even if outside forces were causing them trouble. Instead you begin to wonder if they are ever going to make it together and then if you even care."
1,Awful,"I have rarely read a story with a man as sexy as Lucien who willingly admits his love (what woman would not like to hear those words from him) for his lady and she, being extraordinarily stuborn, refuses to agree to him until he decides he will give up his inheritance, and he is an Earl. Oh, and she is carrying his heir? Hello, women out there, this is good reading?????? This is romantic? He should have dumped her sorry behind, but he, unlike her, had integrity."
3,Fairly generic romance,"Non-offensive, for the most part, but also non-original. Cynical rake (yawn) who only wants a broodmare for a wife meets independant, outspoken bluestocking ... Better than average writing makes this spin through Yet Another Regency novel worth sticking it through to the end, but it's certainly not going on my keeper shelf."
2,"Great songs, poor quality CD","The songs are great, but this is a poorly done CD with terrible dynamic range. Too bad they didn't remaster it."
5,Epitomizes '70s rock,"When you think of a lasting classic rock song, ""Smoke on the Water"" comes to mind. This would still be a great album if this was the only song on here. Luckily, Deep Purple has many other great, classic tunes that make this a well-rounded hits album. ""Deepest Purple"" is your perfect turn-up-the-volume album that keeps the listener wrapped up in classic hard rock. No fan of 1970's rock can be without this one."
3,Limited In Scope,"Anger Disorders is one of the only books to review the topic. For that reason, it's a worthwhile read. However, the book has two major flaws. First, it treats ""anger"" like a DSM disorder - okay, fair enough, but biased. Second, the book is largely cognitive-behavioral biased. Both of these are reasonable as an approach to address anger but are greatly limiting. My biggest complaint is that issue of 'power and control' as it relates to ""anger"" is essentially ignored. In clinical practice, treating people as having an ""anger"" problem, often pathologizes choice behavior. Such as stance is counter-productive to see ""anger"" as such. Thus, in future editions, throwing in a chapter about the differences between anger and battering would be of use. Most ""anger"" occurs in domestic situations anyway... look it up, eh."
2,Not very good - but there is nothing else on the subject,"This book is a little bit disappointing - like in a lot of european writing there is not enough facts and to much ideology and philosophy. However this book is the only one it is possible to find in english about the topic, so if You want to know more about Red Brigades you can either buy it or learn italian."
2,Sub-average mouse,"What could go wrong with an optical mouse? It doesn't track as well as other mice unless its on a mousepad. I've a white melamine laminate desk, and it won't track at all directly on the desk, and on a white sheet of paper, its tracking tends to stutter rather than move the mouse pointer smoothly across the screen. Its fine sitting on a patterned mouse-pad however. But for non-optimal surfaces, its much much worse than e.g. the Targus mini optical mouse. Cleaning the optical sensor didn't help.On the plus side, the cord retractor is smooth, the mouse is comfortable, and the size is good. But for a portable mouse, I'd rather not have to drag my mousepad around with me."
5,Just What's Needed!,"As an author myself, I search for references that cover new concepts in a concise, comprehensive, and inviting way. Grossman and Valiga give us just what's needed to motivate nurses to think about the importance of acquiring leadership skills at all levels of nursing. Beautifully designed, well written, and just the right size (Seinfeld would definitely call it ""bag-worthy""), this book uses a concise format to cover everything from stewardship to chaos theory in context of a changing health care setting.I recommend this book for any student or nurse. If you happen to teach nurses, you'll love the critical thinking exercises that guide and challenge new nurses to ponder their own growth as a leader."
5,Wow,"This should be included with every bag Domke makes. I bought it to use with a Domke messenger bag and it is an absolute must have with the heavy stuff that lands in that bag. A big BOO to Domke for selling half finished bags and charging more to complete it. I do love this pad and it is a great comfort for ""Heavy Haulers""."
2,Worked fine but didn't last,"I used the shoulder strap on a recent trip with a duffle bag loaded with 40 lbs. It was a huge improvement over the unpadded strap, but almost right away the leather began to seperate from the foam padding. By the 4th time carrying the duffle the leather had completely ripped off."
1,Broke first time,The nursing clasp broke the first (an only) time I wore this bra. The plastic clasp is obviously cheap and too weak.I would not recommend this product at all.I have been very happy with my Motherhood bras and would recommend those instead.
1,The Royle Family - The Complete First Season,"As a fan of good British comedy, I must be truthful here and tell you....this show is not funny!It's a low class family who sits around in the living room and talks nonsense. The father is disgusting, picking his nose and other disgusting gestures. I waited and waited for even a smile..nothing..it is a great disappointment. I would not recommend this series to anyone!If you want good British comedy humor try, Dad's Army (the best), Only Fools and Horses, Open All Night, On the Buses just to name a few."
5,Hip-Hop/R&B with a new sound!,"I got this cd from a friend and it was really great. I am so tired of that same old rap & r&b that degrades women and promotes violence, drugs & sex. For once, these two women talk about issues that I can relate to and make me motivated. They have a jazzy style, a back and forth style, a style that will make you listen to the entire CD without skipping a track! Not skits to fill it up. They give you everything they got. I loved it. Damn good is my favorite song, so is Corner."
2,Product was recommended for Shingles,Used this product and I didn't feel any relief from this. Maybe it would work at the onset not after.
4,"One More, One Last Cowboy Song","Rock solid compilation blending substance & style.One more, one last beer is very well written, catchy song that fits right in with other Americana gems from likes of Mark David Manders, Max Stalling, or Brian Burns.Cowboy Song is a re-do of the Thin Lizzy song by same name from the 'Jailbreak' album.I actually like Brian's version better!It is a bit more countrified than the Thin Lizzy version (blinding statement of the obvious). The subject seems to mesh better with Brian's style than the original rock-out version. No offense to Thin Lizzy.Kudos. Nice work Mr. Houser."
3,Average Bocelli at best,"I bought this Bocelli album because I truly wanted to hear him perform ""Plaisir D'Amour,"" one of my all time favorites. While I do love Bocelli I wasn't completely impressed with the entire CD. This is not the best I've heard from Andrea and his voice is not great throughout the CD. I do enjoy it though. He's one of the few artists I can listen to these days without getting a headache."
5,Sentimento-Outstanding,"Truly magnficent.Andrea's voice gets better and better,if that is possible.Sogno l'Amour is my favorite.He sings it with so much passion! Occhi d Fatta is another favorite.I love them all."
2,Some useful information......book of poor quality,I actually just purchased the 5th edition of the same book in September 2008. Didn't receive the book until mid December 2008. Book looks as though someone photo copied it and took it to Kinko's to have a plastic binder added to it....Chapters skip around. In black & white on copy paper. Misspellings. And definitely isn't worth the $60 I paid for it.I am completely disappointed by this book and wouldn't purchase another one.
5,Outstanding!,If you like Third Stream (classical and jazz) this is the CD for you!I loved everything on it but particularly Little Blue Devil by Schuller.Definitely worth getting if you're a percussionist.
3,Price Hike,i bought this item in August 08 for $5.13. I dont know if they were having a sale on them at the time but when I go to buy another one today the price almost tripled. It was $17.59. I was shocked at how something so small could have tripled in price. Talk about a markup. It was a good product when I had it on my phone. I bumped into something and it caught the phone and snapped the clip right off. Talk about being bummed out. Now I'm stuck with a cheapy that I found on Ebay.
3,"A welcome addition, but far from complete","There are better Scott Walker collections on the market, but this one is unique in that the second disc has a lot of the tunes from his out-of-print albums ""Sings Songs From His TV Series"" and ""The Moviegoer"" and ""Any Day Now."" Nevermind that these are probably the low point of his recorded output, there are a few gems to be found. Still, it really would have been preferable to just have those three albums re-released on CD."
5,Dvorjak's Requiem,"This is an excellent rendition of Dvorjak's Requiem. The Choral group have excellent diction and are sensitive to the light and shade required to bring our the meaning of the words. The Orchestra too contributes to the unity of the work. The Soloists are first class with beautiful voices. the conductor is to be congratulated for his skill in bring the three sections-chorus, soloists and orchestra-together to effectively recreate this wonderful work."
3,small problem detracts from a very good shoe,"We bought this shoe as a gift for an out-of town guest. It arrived in a timely manner and everyone was thrilled with the suprise! The only problem was a bad eyelet which is shredding the shoelace each time the shoe is tied. A small problem but we did not have time to return and replace the shoes. The lace will have to be replaced on a regular basis taking some of the joy out of the purchase. We DID NOT approach the seller whom I'm sure would have corrected with a replacement pair. Just a downside to e-commerce,can't jump in the car and return an item!"
2,silk sea sponge,i purchased the sea sponge and i was not happy with the size it is very very small.the sponge after several usage it falls apart it is not worth the price.
3,Not bad.... not bad atall,"I first saw this movie when I was about three years old. At that time, this movie was like, ""WHOA!!"" Now, after seeing movies like The Relic and Mimic, I look back on this movie and say, ""How simplistic and primitive we were..."" This movie had a good plot and story, character developement for some people was a bit dry (the main character had the only good developement really) and the monster was actually pretty cool for a freeze-frame animated one. Needless to say, if this movie were remade with a little more character developement, a better soundtrack (they would HAVE TO throw Megadeth in on that one), and a computer rendered monster instead, then this movie would rule."
2,Serpent was the only good thing about this flick,"Based on the reviews I've read about this film, I thought it would be better. The bird, Quetzalcoatl, was a bit on the cheesy side in terms of effect. But that's not the thing that bothered my about this little-known movie, at least little-known to me, it was how Carradine reached conclusions and suspended disbelief so easily. The flow of logic or lack thereof really annoyed the hell out of me.Moriarty has a face that also annoys me. But I didn't give this movie two stars because of that.But overall, an enjoyable horror film worth a rental. I bought it.The transfer was pretty decent for the most part. There was, however, some minor artefacts which could've been cleaned up but I guess it wasn't worth the extra funds.The killings, by the way, were gory enough to hold my interest."
3,not worth it,it was fast service from Amazon but not worth it after seeing it only contains 6 songs.
4,Great Tunes!,The CD was just what I was looking for and in good condition. The seller shipped immediately and I received it sooner than I though would happen. I'm very happy with this purchase!
2,Not quite their best,"Everything is good up until its production. It's very hard to hear Messiah Marcolin's voice through loud guitars. It really opaques his voice. Other than that, it was a great effort. However, he needs to come back to rejoin the group and save them."
3,"Classic Lineup, But Not Classic 'Mass","(Sorry for the brief review, but the computer ate the nice, longer one)Yes, this is the classic lineup w/ Marcolin on vocals once more, but if you get this expecting 'Nightfall Pt 2', you're gonna be disappointed. The main difference is the guitar tone, which has a rather raw, buzzy tone to it. It's not stoner-ish and it's not nu-metal crap, but it gives the album an edgy feeling that is very different from the polished guitar sound on the classic 'Mass albums. It's not bad, but it takes some getting used to. Only other complaint would be with the packaging- the band logo is on a decal on the jewel case, not on the booklet, so if the case gets busted you'll hafta peel it off and tape it onto a new case"
2,"Short fantasy stories written in a dry, prissy style","I see that most of the reviews here are positive, but this book just didn't work for me. I do not know why Asimov decided to try his hand at fantasy, but I don't think he succeeded very well. While the stories that make up AZAZEL are imaginative enough, they are written in a prissy style meant to evoke the character of their fictional narrator, George. I found this tedious, and eventually annoying. In the hands (or typewriter) of a master short story teller like Robert Sheckley or Fredric Brown, these stories could have been real gems. As written, however, they fall short and land flat."
1,I won't buy partial seasons-----PERIOD,"Although I love the series and would love to own Season 4 as a complete, reasonably priced full season.....it is not avail except in the ""greedy over-priced"" version"". My reasoning is that there are plenty of great series available and I will skip HGWT Season 4 until offered as a value by the company not with them gouging me."
1,We as customers should be upset..I know I am.,$40 for 1/2 a season...thats $80 for Season 4...YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING...I won't buy this now or ever at this price!!!
1,rip off,3 discswhat a ripwhy does amazon even carry this. you get a full season (1-3) for the price of this half season. if they would not carry this just maybe they might send a message but instead they are putting their customers last!
1,Greed reeks!,"I like the series (five stars), but to divide a season into parts shows excessive greed (thus the one star). I will buy a full-season version, not a part-season one. Chinese bootleggers, where are you?"
2,Advice to Paramount,"Attention Paramount Video: It's very simple. If you decide to break up a season into two half-season sets, simply charge half as much! This is the way to do business. Oh, and don't make the fans wait forever before you gouge them!"
5,"Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Destiny, vol. 4","I bought the movie for my kids ages 8,11 and 19 and they loved it! My husband actually watched it with them and completely enjoyed it also."
3,It's alright...,"After listening to most of the tracks, it was clear to me that he is obviously going soft unlike the player he was...with the exception of a good club beat called ""hell yeah""...the song is pretty catchy along with the song ""sex"" but it doesn't make the cd great...neither does the slow songs. On the other hand, some of his slow songs are good but id rather hear some songs with uptempo club beats...all in all, the cd is alright. If you listen to his past cd's you can tell the difference."
4,G's Number One Fan,Now I will get anything that Ginuwine produces but this cd I must say is the one of his best. I am really feeling the songs and the tempo. It takes me back to the first cd he came out with.
5,Ginuwine's Best Effort Yet!,"Ginuwine has always been a great entertainer. However, his latest effort stands out compared to his previous 3 albums. Before I listened to this album I thought that this couldn't be better than his last album The Life. I thought to myself there was no way he could follow up his hit single ""Differences"" from The Life but once again the rising hip hop/r&b artist proved me wrong. Club bangers ""Hell Yeah"" and its remix are the frontrunners of the album. However, the album is relatively slower than I expected. ""In Those Jeans"" which I can already tell you is destined to be a furture hit single and maybe the best song of the album goes with that flow along with tracks ""Love You More"" and ""Get Ready"". Also, his hit single ""Stingy"" from the Barbershop Soundstrack which was released during the winter is on the album. In many ways this is Ginuwine's Best Effort Yet!"
5,Ginuwine's best cd to date!!!!,"Ginuwine never fails to impress. He has some of the best music i have ever heard, and on the Senior it's no different. With songs such as Love you More Everyday, On My Way, Bedda to have loved, In Those Jeans, Bedda Man, and Our First Born Ginuwine proves he is the master of ballads and proves that it's not only his looks and his dancing skills that makes him the top r&b artist today. He shows on songs like sex and hell yea that he could get the clubs bumpin too. This cd is off the hook, there isnt 1 bad song on it and this should be considered the top r&b cd for 2003. He definately deserves awards for this 1. Great Job G!!! P.S. Ginuwine is the best dancer in the industry today, no one can compete with him."
4,necessary for beginning bowyers,"this book is essential for anyone who wants to make archery tackle out of natural materials. i still go to school and archery has taken hold of my interest. i spent hours on the computer scraping bits of information until i came upon this book online. after reading it through, all my problems were solved. this book has all the basics. from wood choosing to laying out your bow to designing practical bows from all kinds of woods. however, if you are in an area that has plenty of trees but are forbidden to cut it, then you are probably stuck with making board bows (which are cheap at 3.50 for an 11 ft piece) and for more info on board bows, then the 2nd vol. of this series is probably the best.this book is a very good book for bowyers and got me started and i am still hooked (a year and three broken bows after. apparently the average bowmaker breaks 12 bows before making a good one :)"
2,Lacks practical instructions on bow building,I bought both volume 1 and 2 of this series. I was very disappointed that there was so little practical instruction on the actual building of a bow. Way too much historical stuff that was of no interest to me. I don't know how many volumes you have to buy to get the right information. I would not recommend this series.
5,A Triumph for John Williams Fans,"Item was recevied very promptly and in excellent condition. The content of the box is superb; it contains the best of Williams' original Star Wars scores in superior audio quality. While music missing from this set can be found on other releases, they lack the care and collectibility of this set. Highly recommended for Star Wars fans across the galaxy!"
1,REVIEW FOR CD (3591-2) 1/01/1990 Qwest UPC:75992359122,"THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE FOLLOWING RELEASE.CD (3591-2)Release Date: 1990Record Label: QwestUPC: 075992359122TRACK (4) ""EVERY HOME SHOULD HAVE ONE"" IS NOT THE ORIGINAL ALBUM MIX.THE NICE SAX BREAK IS REPLACED WITH SOME HOP-TO-IT CORNBALL SOUNDING BRASS SECTION."
1,"""Thanks For Making Me A Fighter."" Oh Please.",You don't make someone a fighter. You make someone a sandwhich. You learn to become a fighter. Someone just doesn't instantly turn you into one.
3,Wish they had low sodium line,"I love most of the Zatarains products.Just wish they had a low sodium line.The amount of salt in one serving,is enough for the whole day...anda little bit of tomorrow."
4,"Eden, Adult Soap Opera",I actually worked as an extra doing walk thru while this was being produced at Las Hadas in Manzanillo Mexico. Great cast and crew.
2,Very Disappointing,"I am notorious for liking bad natural disaster movies... but this is awful, even for me. The effects were awful (the opening sequence is just ridiculous), the acting very poor, the overall effect is not very interesting. The best acting was done by Xander, but this performance was mediocre for him. I just wasn't impressed at all. I'd rent this before thinking of buying it. I'm sure glad I did."
3,Another blame it on us move,I guess they have to program us one way or another. I like it only for the fact that things and people get destroyed.
5,My husband was there! It's accurate.,"This movie version ""Passion and Paradise"" of Sir Harry Oakes' circumstances surrounding his life and death, stays very close to the actual truth. My husband went through the Oaks' ""cottage"", the wealthiest man in the world (before his death), and everything was exactly as it is recalled here in this movie -- decades later. Amazing. I don't know how the producer was able to land a film this accurately. One of our favorite movies of all time. A best choice for a great date night. Every sailor's ""MUST SEE""."
3,For those with imaginations and lots of time on their hands!,"There were not very many real-life applications in this book, which was very disappointing. The colors were more in the pastel range, and hardly any of the rooms shown contained a deep or bright color. If you are looking to introduce deep color into your home, skip this book and try Alice Westgate's ""The Complete Color Directory"". It's full of beautiful colors and even contains color swatches and how to's on using pigment for different effects."
2,rkorb15,"Having recently purchased seven different books on interior color combinations and inspiration, this book is the most useless I now own. The ""Pallets"" are not that different from one another, the water-color drawings are almost irrelevant, the color chips are not related to photographs of rooms, the prose is overly romantic; and worst of all, we all do not live in Massachusetts! (Nor have most of us travelled abroad.) I did not find ideas here to use in my color decisions, and it will sit on the shelf gathering dust. Unless you're a beginner, buy Leatrice Eisman instead!"
2,VERY limited,"This book should be in a Grade 3 art class. Boring colours, limited applicability. Does NOT live up to it's title - the colours are washed out and flat - no life to the photos. I returned it because it was not what it claimed to be."
3,Great music - Raw Performance - Poor Engineering,"While the music from Empire Strikes Back is my favorite from all the Trilogy, this recording presents it in a very raw, unpolished manner. Mixing quality is mediocre, with any number of editing flubs.I'd love to hear a recording of this music with the production values of the recent ""Phantom Menace"" soundtrack."
3,A little disappointed...,"First, I have to give Ms Austin her due - she does five star work on this album. I wore out two audiocassettes of this album in the eighties and nineties, and remember them to be flawlessly recorded, mixed and produced. Room filling sound that was rich and full. By comparison, this CD sounds flat and dull. It works overhard just to fill up the cab of my pick-up truck with music; and its nowhere near as exhilarating as it should be.All that being said, it's better to have this version than to not have this album. Someone should think about getting QWEST to remaster and re-release it."
3,barely fits,"yes, the previous reviewer was correct. The king size quilt might be about perfect for a queen size bed, but this quilt doesn't fit a standard king size bed! too small!"
4,Flora's Ring Quilt Set with Shams,Very pretty item. Quality is not exceptional. A good buy for the price.
2,weak prequal,"Too much (or would it be too many?) low budget pyrotechnics and gratuitous gore (at least in the unrated version). With a fairly weak back story, this doesn't live up to the standard of the first movie. On the whole, pretty disappointing."
1,Another bad one,"Very little plot and absolutely no good acting, but the director oblivously thought that if he added enough blood, guts and gore no one would notice. It is very noticable."
2,Awful recording,This is a perfectly abysmal recording and shouldn't be offered as an MP3 download. Amazon should be scolded for even considering this recording. It may be a recording of the most divine Callas - but you'd never know it. Avoid it.
4,Patho Review,The language of the book is hard. There are no pictures. The book is a good recienforcement of what is taught in class.
3,Nursing Text...,Most of citations are taken from far better pathology books. Lots of inconstancies and weirdness.
3,Alright for nostalgia,"Video quality is OK, looks like it was converted to DVD from a commercial VHS tape. American commentators are AWFUL and make non-stop ""gay"" jokes. Thankfully, Japanese commentary is an option in the language menu. Matches were average, but fine as an introduction to FMW's lineup from 95-96. Wrestler entrances are not included, although introductory interviews are and stupid vignettes with the commentators between matches."
4,No longer on Prime?,"I was in the middle of Season 8, and all of the sudden these are not available on Prime Instant Video? What's going on? I was really enjoying watching this."
1,Yeah a miss call by Amazon,"I may go over to Netflix or just get from Library. And the $8.99 that sure seems very high, many movies are $2.99....and this is just a shorter TV program. Wonder how this came about?"
5,Very entertaining!,"I'm glad to see that Midsomer Murders is now part of Amazon Prime VOD. The first season was very enjoyable and I look forward to watching the rest of the seasons (although I would imagine the English countryside by that time will be significantly de-populated due to all the murders and subsequent jailings - LOL). Good series - although for the life of me, I cannot fathom WHY Amazon is charging $8.99 per EPISODE for this show. Crazy."
2,dissapointed,"im sure the book is fine for those of us who can read. My 5 and 6 year old children(and myself) prefer the hidden picture books that show the pictures that need to be found, not in words, but actual pictures.thanks,amy"
3,"Great music, poor digital mastering to CD.","The music on this 3 CD set represents what I feel is Goodman's best work. This makes it so unfortunate that the sound quality of the CD is so thin and flat. The producers had some good source material so there is no excuse for the lack of fidelity in this set.If one compares this set to something like the Decca Billie Holiday set, you have to wonder what went wrong with this CD.Perhaps the producer had a phobia about surface noise and the engineer was forced to overprocess the music to death.Even though I am unhappy with the sound quality of this BMG product, I would not be without it because the music is so good."
3,"No Controversary, just working on his signature sound","While this has some fine moments, especially the first 3 songs, like the title track, Sexuality, and Do Me Baby, you can here Prince breaking out of the urban, R& B funk, and getting into his guitar funk pop mix that will be more evident on this follow up 1999. But if you're looking for good songs off of this stick with The Hits 1 & 2/B - Sides collection."
4,Brilliant blend of funk and pop and rock,"This lovely slab of funky pop-rock succeeds in the risque songs like Jack U Off, Sexuality and the sensual ballad Do Me Baby but doesn't do it for me when it comes to politics, as in the title track, Ronnie Talk to Russia or Annie Christian, although these last-mentioned aren't dismal failures either, since they're saved by the beat. The secret of this early period Prince was the urgency in the songs, a type of nervous tension reflected perfectly in the mix of urban styles and his voice. He created and refined a brilliant blend of dance and rock that went down well in both the disco and the lounge. Controversy is not usually highly acclaimed by the critics, but to my ears all the Prince magic is here, and it has aged remarkably well."
3,A Sign Of Things To Come,"Not quite prime time Prince material. Nonetheless, there are some good bouncy tunes. Of course the title track stands strong as well as the album closer Jack You Off. Do Me, Baby has a captivating slow groove and Joy is just enjoyable. Funny when you find the right word.Definitely a good album to put on when you feel like dancing. However the eight songs do not distinguish themselves as much as later releases(1999, Purple Rain, Sign O' The Times)would. However, there is some Joy that you will experience when listening to this CD."
5,Excellent treatment,"Maher's book was a classic from the moment it was released. As an archivist in a theological school library, this guide has been indispensible to me. The book covers a variety of subjects: description, arrangement, records management, electronic records, student workers, etc. Maher's discussions are never too technical, yet they avoid being over simplistic. His discussion of classification guides and provenance should be read by all academic archivists."
1,Blah,"This book goes into more detail about D'Orsay's inner circle than D'Orsay himself. I would have liked to read more about the ""life and escapades"" of D'Orsay, and the creation of a fashion icon instead the of the life of Lord & Lady Blessington. Foulkes makes many interesting points pertaining to the early life of D'Orsay and his budding relationship with the Blessingtons. Nonetheless, this book is rather dull read."
4,Great Show!,"I saw Barrage live as the entertainment at an international business convention. The DVD is a great representation of the talent of the band members and the energy they bring to the stage. As far as features go, it's an unexceptional DVD. Buy it for the music and show - not for any extras."
1,inaccuracy and poor editing,"This book has been produced without due editorial care and attention - the index is arbitrary and incomplete, and I found many incorrect cross-references. A factual inaccuracy: Arnold Schoenberg's grave in the Zentralfriedhof is not in section 33C, but in 32C. Nor is it organised in a way that makes it particularly easy to use; in my view, the principle of organisation used in Michelin Guides is superior."
4,Great pad,"I don't understand the people who diss this pad because it's louder than others. I think that's a real advantage. The conventional pads are way too quiet. You can't really play dynamics.It's true that your roommates won't like this one, but they shouldn't have agreed to room with a drummer. Drums are loud!This is a really good pad."
3,Remo 8-inch Practice Pad,"I've had this pad for years. Two months ago I got anEvans 2-Sided Practice Pad, 12 Inch. The Evans pad is superior. Evans also makes that in a 6-inch version (available at the same link). The Remo pad sounds like I'm hitting a cardboard box. I've got both the Remo and the Evans and I only practice on the Evans pad. I like it so much I may get their 6-inch version also. Honestly - take a chance on the Evans pad. I think you'll like it better than a Remo."
5,'raising hope' is raising my faith in gentle reads,"what a great gentle read about a dysfunctional family.usually gentle reads=BORING ... not this one, it is very sweet"
3,not his best!!,Not an advanced workout. Mostly arms with some cardio. Very little lower body and a few moves that didn't even make sense. Probably a workout that will be done once a month.
1,What a load of trash,"I have watched some trash in my time, but this is about the worst I have ever seen. Arthur Conan Doyle must be birreling in his grave.My main disappointment that an actor of the calibre of Edward Woodward should deign to appear in such drivel. He must have have had a final notice to pay his gas bill!Anybody who thinks this is good is capable of watching any rubbish and must be easlily pleased, and I would think must be the type who can sit and watch anything.To say it was embarrassing is understatement."
5,"Yummy, yum, yum!!!","I bought this cookbook for my husband (and for 2 others), and it was enjoyed by all! The pics for each recipe are wonderful, the marinades have all been very good so far (we have tried them on both chicken and steaks), and the ""basics"" info in the beginning is also helpful. This truly turned my husband into the ""grill master""!Also, I originally saw this cookbook at Macy's for the list price (I think around 25$), and was amazed to find it on Amazon for 6$ (plus shipping)!!!Great buy!"
4,Weber grill book,Very good book with great guides on what temperature and how long to cook. We use it as a guide for the type of meat even if we are not using the recipes in the book.
4,Great recipes,One big drawback is the binding. If you use it often the binding will break. We attempted to punch holes in it to place in a binder but that also compromises the amount of info you can see.
4,"Awesome Cookbook, terrible binding","I use this cookbook all the time. Not only do I grill all the time, but I've taken a lot of lessons about making marinades and rubs into the kitchen as well. The recipes are easy to follow, easy to modify, and delicious. I just wish it was longer so I could taste more of the author's recipes.A few other reviewers pointed this out, but the binding on this cookbook sucks. After a year or so of heavy use, clumps of pages started falling out. Eventually it got to a point where I was using the cover to just hold together all the loose pages. I took it to Staples and for 6 bucks they cut the binding off and spiral-bound it. Now it's perfect!"
4,"Great book, but could be a little better for beginners","I'm totally new to grilling, so a very basic guide I guess is what I'm looking for, something that goes step by step. This book isn't exactly that, but it's still very good. First off, it has pictures for every recipe, which I love. It's got a bunch of different rubs and marinades you can make and kind of experiment with what you like."
1,Agreed? No BPA!,"Muir Glen cans are lined in plastic and leach Bisphenol A. Too bad because this was a great product and was a standard in my household. My initial conversations with them they contradicted this fact, which to me was misleading. General Mills owns Cascadian Farms as well and now I don't buy there either.Now we use BioNature in jars or Pomi products in Tetra Pak cartons. All canned tomato products use BPA and so do many of the lids of jars used in food containment.Now I also just make from scratch which is made simple by chef Andrew Carmellini in Urban Italian. Lydia Bastianich is another favorite chef that deserves mention for simple yet big flavors.Boil, peel, freeze and store. Can manufacturing companies that I corresponded with said they were working on a solution for later this year or next year."
5,THIS CD RULES,"I personally love this cd, though i am not gay. All of the songs are good, something you rarely find in a newer musical (for instance: Jekyll and Hyde) and all the actors are great. I especially like the one who sings the Torch songs. Some of the funniest songs are ""You've Got To Stay In The Game"" which has the male actors dressed up as singing and dancing playing cards, ""Not All Man"" which has a centaur who doesn't realize he is a centaur wondering ""Why do they say I'm not all man?"", and especially the Carol Ann Knippel skit, a struggling small-town musical theatre lover, who runs the Melody Barn, and decides to write her own musicals. ""Annie 3"" cracks me up. ""Be a cockeyed oculus! Whistle a happy song! Everythings comin' up....Crysanthemums!"" Overall I'd say this is one of my new favorite shows, and you should buy it RIGHT NOW, and if you like this one, buy WHOOP-DEE-DOO!, also conceived by Crabtree, but clearly not as good as WHEN PIGS FLY, though very good as well."
4,Bye-bye TABLE salt!,"This salt is truly worth the money. It's MUCH healthier for you and a little goes much further than ordinary table salt. The only thing I dislike about it is that in order to be able to grind the crystals, you need to bake the moisture out of the salt prior to putting it in a grinder."
5,As good as the original series!,"I admit to not really liking Chris Eccleston's Doctor. Maybe it was because he looked like an intergalactic Al Bundy or even a skinhead Tom Baker. Anyhow, that's all past, and we now have an actor who has outranked the legendary Tom Baker as favourite Doctor. David Tennant is the best thing to come to DOCTOR WHO in a long time. He's more believable than his predecessor, and his portrayal of our favourite Time Lord is the best I've seen in quite some time. Series 2 has preserved the spirit of classic DW while taking a bold step into the future (no pun intended), andstory arcs like 'Rise of the Cybermen'/'Age of Steel' and the season finale will not disappoint. 'The Idiot's Lantern' could've been from season 24-26.'School Reunion' and 'Tooth and Claw' are also excellent. Simply put, there is not one single story I didn't like. My highest recommendation, needs to be 10 stars!"
4,a slight problem,I loved the set. I did have a problem with the first disc in the set. My player doesn't seem to want to read it with out trying like 20 times. I even got a new set shipped to me and I'm having the same problem. I like the series enough that I don't want to return the set even with this problem.
5,Good Show,"The second series of Doctor Who continues to be amazingly well written. The acting and direction are credible, making me almost believe that what's happening on the screen is true. It's wrenching at the end and leaves you wanting more.As for the special effects and extras they are fun to watch and informative, if you're in to that type of thing."
5,Love it!!,"What can I say I grew up on Doctor Who, to see it back in production is a thrill for me. David Tennet does a very good job as The Doctor."
5,My Favorite Doctor Who Series!,"David Tennant as The Doctor and Billie Piper as Rose were a perfect team. I was devastated when series 2 ended. They are a perfect pair to a great TV show. This series has drama, mystery, comedy, and it's all acted out in style."
2,Compartment is SMALL!,"I purchased this insert with the thought of putting it in the bottom of my backpack to hold my Canon SLR body and a medium sized zoom lens. Impossible to do! This insert is really small, and I would recommend something else if you have an SLR."
2,Just didn't work well..,"I honestly don't know if it was just a bad unit or just a poor design, but it just didn't work well on our dog. We returned it and got a furminator instead."
4,great recording,"Byron Janis' rendition of Rachmaninov's 1st and 3rd Concertos are nothing short of sheer brilliance. His 1st is lightning quick and full of energy. Only Earl Wild's 1st comes close to it. Janis' 3rd is second only to Argerich's with Chailly on Phillips. The faster pace that he and Argerich chooses for the 3rd is more in line with Rachmaninov's reading, unlike Ashkenazy's or Kissin's who chooses to take the opening more slowly. The recording quality of the RCA Living Stereo is quite good, although there are a couple of places where the sound does distort a bit. In the end, this is a very good CD well worth having."
1,More for children's use,"This binocular was rated as a best buy at many internet sites, but is more for a child than adult regarding distance viewing, not at all good for viewing through glasses. I'm giving it to my grandchild."
1,Shop for a different pair,"Very disappointed in the quality. They received high marks in Consumer Reports and that is why I chose them, however the zoom was terrible. I had to send them back."
2,not a good buy,"I don't know who they paid to write up the recommendations, but I will never rely on them again. I used to use recommendations because I thought that real people did them, but for this product, I think not. It had to sales reps.I see closer with the naked eye than these things. It was a waste of money put the return was a nightmare. They charge 20% if the box is open. Never mind customer satisfaction. How do you determine satisfaction if you don't open the box. We all know how distorting web pictures can be when looking for an item.They are never wha you think they are. Customer satifaction is a myth with this company and I will never order from them again. I should have trusted my first instinct. Never, never again."
1,Bait & Switch,"Company offered a model highly praised by ""Consumer Reports"" that was not in stock at other locations. Ordered despite significantly inflated price. Received a similar, but more lowly rated item whose list price should have been even lower than the one ordered. It was clearly the old ""bait and switch"" routine by this store."
5,Easy to carry while walking,Very small profile but allows you to identify distant objects while hiking and viewing wild life. Very good deal.
4,A Great Gift,"This was purchased as a gift for a Red Sox fan. Needless to say the binoculars have been to every home game since April. They are easy to operate, the clarity is excellent, and if wearing glasses, there is no problem with scratching.The binoculars are light, fit in your pocket. A great deal!"
4,Don't order an extra strap,"I did not see in the description that a strap comes with the binoculars - so I ordered the strap that was recommended by Amazon - the OpTech EZ Comfort Neoprene strap. It's a great strap, but won't work with these binoculars - there's no way to attach it. I'd recommend just using the strap that comes with the binoculars."
5,Olympus binoculars,"As a Christmas gift to a family member, these binocs fit the bill. Not expensive, lightweight and small, well-packed, and the right magnification for birdwatching. No report from the gift receivers yet, but assume they like them."
5,Reverse Google Increases Your Income!,"Wendy Stevens guides you step by step in creative, easy to understand steps on how Google can work for you, therefore increasing your income! Thank you Wendy!Jill and Alex"
1,OUTDATED - PLUS WENDY STEVENS IS ROTTEN,"First, it needs to be pointed out that ALL of these reviews were written by Wendy Stevens herself or ""friends"" of hers. DO NOT believe all the ""positive"" remarks regarding this product. Second, this product is now 100% outdated. Wendy uses this garbage as a sales tool to get new associates to sign up to whatever business/scam she is trying to push. It's REALLY impressive when she says ""go to amazon and type in Reverse Google Marketing"" and all of a sudden a product for $900 shows up and if you join her scam/business she'll send it to you for free. To recap....#1. This product is PURE garbage. It's outdated and no longer of use. #2. These reviews were written by Wendy Stevens. #3. Wendy Stevens is garbage. If she contacts you about a business/scam....I would run in the other direction. Just a bad person to the core."
3,As advertised but dissapointing,"I was disappointed to discover there is no foam protection in the bottom of the domke inserts, eventually I cut and stuffed a sheet of closed cell foam in the bottom of the bag to protect the camera when put down, this is after all the number one impact the bag receives all day long.The sleeve works, but is nothing particular to write home about."
3,Die Cast PLASTIC not METAL,"while it is sitting on a shelf it is ok but it is just cheap plastic and not what I was expecting. with the price I should have expected plastic but when I read ""Die Cast"" in the title I was thinking it would be metal."
3,Superclass was way better,"His following book, Superclass was way better and easier to read. Start with that first. You have to be a historian to appreciate the detail that Running the World presents. Not a bad read, but long winded and detailed to the max. Decent addition to the historian library. But you probably wont be reading this one multiple times as you would Superclass."
2,About the person who wrote the review a bit down,I think what he/she was trying to say was they have another set of these dolls because they are not that old. That is what i think. I dont like these dolls. They are not as beautiful as people describe them to be. I'm not a huge mary kate and ashley fan either.cammi age 11
5,Funnel for canning,I liked this product. I didn't have any problems with it staying in a regular mouth jar or a wide mouth jar. It worked the way a funnel should. I like that it is stainless steel and not plastic. I would buy the product again.
3,Very concise but not interesting in application.,"I have taught high school geography for 10 years and this book covers the basic facts for all the countries, but I do not believe this is what geography is all about. The real ""fun"" in geography is applying the facts to the real world. Why does Pakistan and India not get along? Why might the U.S. be willing to go to war with China over Taiwan? What does Latin America and South Africa have in common? How has physical geography influenced how Europeans have related to western Africans? Facts are great but geography is about using the facts to answer the big questions. This book does not make the jump from facts to application."
2,"Ok, but where's the rest of it?","This book is good for someone that has no idea where Canada is but it falls short due to errors and cultural information. The amount of facts could be located in the CIA World Factbook. A geography book shouldn't just allude to national GDPs but to the traditions, cultures and people that make each one unique. This book glosses over these things too quickly and stresses political and economic factors. Whilst important, they are not the only things constituting nations."
4,good read,"I enjoyed this book but I thought it took awhile to pick up. The ending was good although a little far fetched. I won't spoil it for those of you who haven't read the story. I would have liked to have seen more development in the love plot. Overall, I would recommend this book if you are interested in political thrillers."
5,WOW!!!,"This thriller was certainly the best I have read in my life. If you don't mind seeing f*** every page a couple of times then you have no problems. If you do, still read it.The Incumbent is a political mystery about a reporter for a Boston tabloid (the Record) by the name of Jack Flynn. One day after running a presidential pardon story and sending a letter to the President, Clayton Hutchins, Hutchins invites him to the golf course where a bullet is fired that lands both Hutchins and Flynn in the hospital. The Story is about Jack Flynn trying to figure out who shot it and why. There are many twists and turns on the way there."
5,Intelligent Kid's Fiction,This is one of the best kids books ever -- a clever and thoughtful detective story that's not dumbed down for the grade 1 - 3 set. The first person present voice of the narrator makes the story immediate and exciting. I am astonished it's not still in print; to my mind it's a classic.
3,A Soundtrack but...,"The soundtrack for Episode IV is decent. It contains a lot of the music from the movie as heard in the movie. That is to say, some of the tracks sound truncated or abridged rather than the more polished and seemingly complete pieces that people have heard on previously released soundtracks. That can be a good thing or a bad thing depending upon what the listener wants to hear. For example, the Main Title of Star Wars is shorter in this release but more accurately reflects the music heard while watching the film. If that is what you want, this is your album. There are some alternate versions of tracks included but I find them to be of little consequence.I remember the original soundtrack release on vinyl in 1977. While that contained a set of polished, complete works intended for listening without the movie getting in the way, it was a far superior product, in my opinion. I would love to have that instead of this collection here."
3,"Entertaining, Adventure Story","Down the Mysterly River is a truly entertaining, adventure story. The characters have so much personality that it really makes it a fun read. That being said I did have a few issues with the book. The mystery of the Mysterly River was crystal clear from the get go. The book is a middle aged book, so that may explain the obviousness of the mystery.Also the author has written a series of graphic novels called Fables. These books follow of the lives of fairy tale characters in modern New York City. It almost felt like someone had read Fables and said 'this would be great if it was for the kids' and then Down the Mysterly River came into being. The story of Mysterly River seemed like a riff on one of the Fables story arcs. The writing and characters push past those problems to make this an enjoyable book.Reviewed by Chris for Book Sake."
4,finally organized,"this bag had plenty of room for our 7.5 foot tree, and the handles made it easy to move. there is actually extra room in there for a wreath or garland."
3,Did it's job,"This item did it's job of holding my Christmas tree. However, this product was really bulky. I also noticed that it was starting to get some holes in it where some of the pokey parts of the branches were rubbing it. If you want something inexpensive to hold/protect your tree in then this is your product. It is not long lasting though."
3,"Good protection, but not invulnerable","This worked fine to store our artificial tree for months, though rodents did eventually chew through it, much to our yuletide disappointment."
4,Knowing the Truth,"Great video for information on who and what drives this country to the extremes it goes to become the empire it is. I like the way Mike Ruppert lays out the facts and doesn't try to lead us to conclusions but our own. Gary Webb, the journalist first brought the drug connection with the CIA to the American publics attention which resulted in the CIA going to LA and explain they weren't in the drug trade, this meeting resulted in Mike Rupperts declaration contray to the CIA's story of non involvement. Since then Gary Webb lost his job and conveniently commited suicide. The length and scope of the story that Mike Ruppert tells is unbelieveable. I highly recommend this video for the information it exposes. My hats off to Mike Ruppert for his courage."
5,Barber's Adagio,"Barber's Adagio turns emotion into something palpable that is felt through the notes written on the musical score and through the strings of the beautiful orchestra. An amazingly powerful piece of music, which is able to be respected by even those who are, generally, not classical music fans."
4,Worlds of possibilities,"Since most reviewers below recount memories of their first listen to the adagio, I'll give mine. At Berklee College of Music, a friend of mine played it for me in her dorm room. Afterwords, I didn't dare speak. What words could one use?Although not quite the impact of the first listen, this certainly does the job. Eight renditions with eight different moods and all varying in speed and intensity, the slower having more impact.My favorietes in descending order are the choir, chamber players, quartet, canadian brass and Boston Symphony. The rest didn't make the list and in my opinion are not worth hearing (well, maybe once). The new age synth and flute is almost laughable. When I think though that I payed somewhere around ten dollars for the five aforementioned interpretations, I feel like a cat burglar enjoying freshly stolen shimmering diamonds and enjoy these I will."
2,Dud,"I am not a proffessional JAVA programmer, so keep that in mind when using this review. I find the information hard to read in this book. As a student in the second semester of JAVA, I still need to see good examples of implementation, and this book seems to lack that. There are also mistakes in many places, especially in examples, so it makes it that much harder to learn from this book, and the way the author shows examples of code is hard to follow. I have other books that teach JAVA and find any of them easier to understand and much more useful than this book. I would say that if the intent is to learn the theory of Data Abstraction and Structures, this could be a good book if you can find it easy to read. If you want a reference book, this is the last thing you want to get."
1,Fireplace DVD,"This was money wasted. There are no instructions with the DVD so changing from one mode to another - screensize and sound - is by guess and by golly. I also doubt the claim that this thing is in HD. The picture quality is nowhere near HD. It barely is digital quality.My wife and I are pretty tech-savy and still cannot activate the features we are led to believe are present on the DVD.Be careful before buying this thing. In fact, we'd suggest you not buy it."
2,Rented by mistake,"I have prime viewing so I was comparing fake fireplaces and clinked this one by mistake. Amazon needs to add an are you sure you wish to buy instead of a one click. I am not a fan of this type of thing. You can't feel it... you can't cuddle up in front of it, roast marshmallows, make smores and it did not make me feel warm and toasty inside. I guess some people are into the faux fire thing... but if you can't feel it, smell it... It's pretty, but to me pointless."
4,One of the better fireplace DVD's I've seen!,"Overall pleased with the purchase. The video is crisp and clear and crackling noises sound very authentic. The only reason I rated this four out five stars is because the holiday music soundtrack is only available on two of three scenes, My favorite is the Christmas tree with the fireplace off to the side. It' beautiful. I would definitely recommend this DVD,"
5,Ultimate Fireplace,"Fantastic ,Loved it ,Great Continous Play . Only One problem ,Could'nt smell the smoke . Wife said i can almost feel the heat off of it . Not into the Music so we didnt try it much . Great Job hope to see more ."
4,Great internet device,"I bought this Nokia 770 internet tablet PC at the beginning of the month, and I love it. All of it's controls work great. very bright video, and getting your emails is a snap.The only downside is the battery life. However, except for the battery, it's a great buy for the price."
1,Disappointed,"It only has up to Flash Player 6 which is built in, in it, and to the best of my knowledge and research at this moment of writting this review and I have done some, I can't upgrade it. Thus I can't play Youtube, Dailymotion, etc. on it or watch movies on it.Maybe if somebody know how to upgrade it to the latest Flash Player or to atleast Flash Player 9 or maybe to something equivalent or comparable, I would ask them to please share that knowledge here."
2,Not for oily skin!,"I bought this to help with fine lines and such. I do have very oily skin, and this just made it worse. I can't use it for that reason. Might work for somebody with normal to dry skin. The little I did use, I didn't notice any difference in my skin, just more oiliness."
2,"Outdated; Appropriate for first/second grades, not Kinder.","I thought the ideas were outdated and skimpy. There was not a variety of ideas presented in the book. I would not recommend it. You could get more ideas Googling: Kindergarten activities, names. Or you own grade level."
3,dog still itching,Did not stop my dog from Itching. she love them and I'm sure she's benefiting from them.but did not solve the itching problem.
5,Can't miss with Princeton Review,"I'm a long-time user of PR's books (started with Cracking the SAT 12 years ago). Cracking the GMAT is packed with time saving techniques and methods to eliminate bad answers.What I like best, though, is that they present a back to basics review of each test section rather than ask you to slog through hundreds of formulas, grammar points, etc. like other review books."
4,Clear and helpful!,"I must admit that I haven't used the software that comes with this book so I can not be a judge of the CD-Rom. I will, however, be frank about the book. This was one of the first books on the market after the GMAT format changed to the computer adaptive test. I have to say that this book was very well prepared and researched. This book is very ""user-friendly"", giving clear and concise tutorials and tips. It also provides plenty (!) of practice questions. This book comes highly recommended."
3,Can Do Better!,"Although going over the material covered would help, I dont think this is one of the best guides that one can get access to. The sample exams help if this is one's first experience with computer exams!!"
5,Best Western TV Series Ever!,"I gave this a five star rating because the film has been fully restored to its original quality and the writing and acting is outstanding. This was the first 90-minute Western series and was like watching a film each week. The family feel of the show always drew me to it and is again evident now that I have the opportunity to watch the show over again. If you are a fan of the Western genre, then this is a must have for you. If you aren't a fan, try it anyway. I am sure the excellent writing and the out stand acting will draw you in. In my humble opinion, the is absolute positively the best Western series ever made."
3,CD,"I purchased the CD as I viewed the original performance and had 8-track tape. The CD does not have the quality of sound the 8-track had, very flat. Such a shame as Lena Horne was at her best when originally produced."
4,Photo-book on the Mighty Jug!,"Published in 1999, Dan Patterson and Paul Perkin's book is a photo-and-text tribute to Republic's seven-ton, war-winning P-47 Thunderbolt. Part of the 'Living History' series, it uses re-enactors posed around the aircraft in question to create an evocative picture of war-time flying.THUNDERBOLT tops off at 64 pages. Perkins contributes a 14-page bio of the P-47 including a sample fighter-bomber mission. The photo mix includes vintage pix of 8th AF Jugs, pilots, ground crew and combat scenes along with Patterson's contemporary shots of the Midwest Aviation Museum's P-47D marked as Dave Schilling's LM*S of the 56th FG. Patterson includes air-to-air and ground shots as well as many nicely-done close-ups of the cockpit, machine-guns, engine, wheels, etc.All in all, it's a neat photo tribute to one of history's most famous warplanes. Recommended."
3,Great CLEP resource,"I used this text for my Human Development CLEP and I passed it with flying colors. I would recommend it for CLEP review. It does have its faults though, not enough diversity and lacks a variety of actual tests/studies in the field - which showed me a weak spot in my CLEP review."
1,Kindle edition for PC or MAC insufficient,"The Kindle edition for PC or Mac (or iphone) displays many of the graphics so small that their contents can't be read or understood. Zooming isn't possible on either the PC or Mac desktop versions. On the iphone, it results in a larger, but distorted graphic that is equally unreadable. No savings here. I'm about to buy a hard copy, which means I've wasted my $55.00."
4,I love my bebepod!,"I bought the bebe pod when my daughter was small to help her sit up. The sides and front were high enough to where she wouldn't fall out. And it is a lot softer than it looks. Durable too, we can toss it around the house and it doesn't fall apart. She's a year old now and we still use it when we don't feel like pulling out the highchair. She's small for her age and it fits her perfectly. I would totally recommend this product, it's been great for us."
2,really?,I am very surprised that this product has the DOMKE name on it. The insert arrived with a couple of the foam inserts loose in the bag. They are not sewn into the insert walls. The craftsmanship of this product does even remotely match the quality of the DOMKE bag. At best this product is worth about half of the asking price.
3,Engrossing,"Recommended by my mother in law, this book had me involved with the lives of a Virginia family from the first few pages. I could not put it down."
5,9160 XL,"I switched from a foil shaver to the 9160XL. I could not be more happy. Great shave, smoothe and more comfortable than the foil."
3,I didnt like it,For a better price I bought waterproof shaver ( Norelco) which has a better recharger (heavier and stays more stable on the counter)Extra LED s for battery condition is really not necessary and it probably consumes more battery power..
3,Good Shaver But Not Worth an Upgrade,"I am a 30 year Norelco user who also owns a five year old Norelco 6885XL which was the top of Norelco's line when purchased. In my opinion the new Smart Touch line that uses the HQ9 heads is not worth the upgrade. I buy new heads once a year, which makes my older shaver feel like new. The only real reason to upgrade a Quadra/HQ7 Norelco is if the batteries are failing--and there are numerous places now where you can have your dying batteries replaced.Don't fall for ""the latest is always better"" line."
4,Norelco shaver,This is my third Norelco shaver in the last 30 years...works as good as expected. I like the battery power left display as well as the ability to clean it by running water on the cutting head.
3,Norelco 9160-XL,"I am somewhat disappointed in the primary function of this shaver. It doesn't shave well! I have to go over areas of my face numerous times before it gets the bulk of the whiskers. I STILL have to use a manual razor for too much of the detail work.The stand that the unit slides into for charging is annoying. I usually have to pick up the stand and ""eyeball"" the unit on to the charging prongs. Poor design.The trimmer feature is great and the cleanup is easy."
1,Have not recieved the item yet,"Please note that I live in Turkey and had provided you my in-law's address for shipping all of the items purchased. I have not yet received the items I ordered. I will be happy to give you an evaluation when I do get them ( in about 2 months).I wish you could ship them directly to addresses outside of U.S. at reasonable prices.p.s. Since I had to rate the item in order for this review to reach you, I rated it one star although when I get it, it will be 5 stars!I hope."
3,Nothing Special,I've been using it for a few weeks now and it doesn't do anything for my acne. Only thing it does for me which is why it gets 3 stars is make my face feel smooth and refreshed afterwards. It has a weird smell when its dried up and after you wash it off for a bit. Only mask that has worked for me on acne is the proactiv one but thats the only product from proactiv worth getting. The other stuff don't cut it. A lot of acne products out there don't cut it fully. w/e
1,Don't waste your money,I recently started breaking out more often because I was working out more than usual. I got this product and was hoping it would cut down on my break outs. I used it for two months and saw no improvement. It's expensive and not worth it.I'm still hunting for an over the counter acne treatment that is somewhat effective.
4,Good everyday carpet cleaner,"This is a great cleaner to keep heavy traffic areas clean. There is a visible difference after using this cleaner. This does not take the place of a professional cleaner. I still hire a company to steam clean every couple of years. The one thing that I don't like about this product is that it uses A LOT of cleaning solution to a relatively small area of carpet. Overall a great product, though."
4,Good Carpet Cleaning Solution,This product performed well removing soiled spots from berber carpet. The job done at the doorway entrances was just fair but did present a good improvement.
5,"Domke camera bag, model F-2","This bag is a quality product at a reasonable price. It is made and sized for most camera uses. I would strongly recommend this product. The only suggestion I have is that the snaps on the straps attached too the top flap are a little difficult to use due to the stiffness of the springs. However, I am satified with this product."
5,I love it!,"Just the bag I needed. Lots of room for my stuff, and still small enough to go as cabin luggage."
4,Great Shoulder Bag,"I purchased this camera bag looking for something that would hold cameras with long lenses attached. Though large, it is useful for carrying one camera with an attached med to long lens. Canon40d w/ 80-200 lens: the lens hood has to be removed-inverted. Canon40D w/ 24-70 + hood fits easily. High quality material and sturdy. I really go for canvas! The pockets are roomier than they look and I had no problems holding all my accessories. There is not much padding on the bottom so I purchased a bag of inexpensive microfiber cloths to ""pack"" the camera. The cloths also come in handy keeping things clean out in the field. I like that it has the shoulder strap AND a shorter handle strap you can use to grab the bag in a hurry."
2,Has not aged well,"I grew up on Virgil Fox. But this CD really butchered the performance. The old vinyl Heavy Organ series was actually cleaner sounding, had less of Fox's peculiarities and over-talk. A disappointment."
5,Smooth lips!,"Great product before lipstick as a primer. Helps lipstick resist bleeding and softens lips! Great product. I bought this product years ago......(and one tube lasts a long time!).....ran out, tried other products, and then found this again on Amazon! So happy!"
2,Less is not more,I know that it was only $11 but this protective sheet is thin and provides little protection. While the stitching was nice and it was made in the USA (at least that is what the sticker said) they could have spend $.50 more on good neoprene and made it a good item. Chintzy feeling.
1,Nah.....,"A sci-fi flick starring Paul Newman? Gotta be good, how did I miss this in the theaters?Fast forward to 1984. I'm on a temporary assignment in England. This turkey is on BBC at 2 AM. No VCR. Only choice is to stay up and watch it. I convince a bunch of friends to come over. I supply the beer and snacks. Half way through the movie, my friends threaten to beat me to death and walk out.Now I know why I missed this in the theaters. It must have been pulled on the first day. Actually freezing to death would be more fun than watching these people do it."
1,Frozen Garbage,"This may not be Paul Newman's worst performance but there's a strong likelihood that it may be the worst movie he's ever appeared in. Regardless, this is probably director Robert Altman's worst film. Newman tries but he's virtually stranded by the inert material he's given to work with. The unsuspecting viewer is left trying to pinch themselves to draw blood just to survive this cinematic endurance test. The film in a nutshell is a post-apocalyptic dystopian fantasy about a game of death involving alot of geriatric Euros spouting out meaningless philosophy about the meaning of life. Who actually thought this stuff would be interesting? Altman can blame the writers but be contributed to the script. Of mild semi-interest is the art direction. Pretty heady praise. Don't even bother with this waste of celluloid."
1,Disappointed,"I returned these CDs because they bore no resemblance to what they were advertised to be, i.e., Patty's original recordings."
5,Works as expected.,No surprises. This is what the description says it is. Standard Torx Screwdriver. Not much else to say about it.
5,Red Hot Smokin' Blues!,"I've seen Janiva many times live, sometimes in small clubs and sometimes at Blues Festivals and she ALWAYS puts on a fantastic performance. If there is a better female blues belter out there I haven't heard her. This cd is a departure from her previous ones as this is a more stripped down sound. Her voice has never been better and I think this may be my favorite cd of hers. If you want to hear what a real blues singer sounds like buy any or all of her CDs and you won't be disappointed. Also, if you ever get an opportunity to catch a live show you'll be glad you did. By the way my favorite reviewer on Amazon is Avalondon, please send me an email."
5,Very Interesting,I like the variety of styles on this album. The sound is terrific and the music itself is engaging. Maybe that's because my brother plays bass clarinet in some of the selections! :)
4,Kids enjoy it,"Kids enjoy it. We don't have ""tv"" so this is a good way to familiarize them with Sesame Street."
3,"Doesn't Hold My Twin's Interest, For Some Reason","We've owned this DVD for about a year now and for some reason, my 2 year old twins have never been and still are not interested in it. They LOVE Ernie & Bert, but it just doesn't hold their interest. Still, we keep trying to reintroduce it. Perhaps it is specific to them, but they do absolutely love ""Learning About Letters"" and ""The Best of Elmo"". I would check those out if you are looking for excellent Sesame Street videos. Both of them have a lot of songs, which holds the interest of most toddlers. Perhaps my girls will love the Word Play video in 6 months or a year. We'll keep trying, but it just isn't a hit, for some reason. It is the only video we own that they have no interest in. That being said, Sesame Street is one of the best programs for little ones, so you might want to still give it a try. Looks like it is a hit with a lot of others out there."
2,Terry,"This CD has a few really good songs like Depending On You and Real Love but overall its not as good as any of the Doobie Brother's older studio albums. This Cd is average at best but then I'm a Tommy Johnston, Doobies original lead singer, fan."
2,Typical Doobies - But not up to scratch,"The second of the Doobie albums was pure Doobie in the same genre as always , more laid back, and from a long term Doobie fan overall dissapointing, re issues of previous tracks and nothing really new and interesting. I have heard Doobie Live in NZ / New Plymouth. They were fantastic live. It should have been recorded."
5,"Informative, yet entertaining","Truly, I'm not a complete idiot when it comes to grammar. But the English language is so screwed up that even experts admit to having trouble with it. This book will help explain some of the more problematic parts of grammar while keeping you entertained. I've read dozens of books on grammar, but they were all very dry and confusing. This is the first one that makes it all seem so simple. The author gives hints for remembering the rules about many of the more confusing elements of our language--like who/whom--which makes this book even more valuable. Through exercises and interesting sidenotes and facts, you'll learn spelling tricks, the correct uses for colons and semicolons, when to use 'lay' and when to use 'lie,' and gobs of other things. Confused about predicates and prepositions? No problem. This book explains it. Need help with cover letters or memos? Bingo--this book will assist. It's a wonderful book and one I can't live without. The best grammar book I own."
4,Super!,"I'm not usually a fan of ""Idiot's Guides"" but this one is well written and clever. Worth adding to my bulging shelf of grammar materials and more enjoyable to read."
4,An enjoyable piece of sleaze,"3 hot japanese supermodels play a trio of ghostbusters in an erotic comedy. Basically it is just fluff. There is not any hardcore action though and there is a story, so this is not porn."
4,Awesome,The sword is longer than I would have thought it was going to be. It's a great replica and toy though. Works as one double sword or two.
3,Very JAK!,"If you like Jane Ann Krentz, then this is the book for you. In fact, if I hadn't looked at the cover, I would have assumed that she wrote it. Strong, silent, almost overly-hardened hero meets generous, funny, and quirky heroine with an eccentric family. She falls for him, and hopes that she can break through the tough shell to the gentle man underneath. Sound familiar?Still, despite the obvious connection this is a cute book. Ali is a fun character. Her chocolate shop, complete with midnight runs to the local heath spa for the junkies, is a perfect setting. The minor characters are mildly interesting, especially Charlotte Elizabeth and Miss Sophie. A light and entertaining read that won't keep you in suspense."
4,A SWEET STORY,"In SWEET SUCCESS, Alison Thomas, daughter of a beautiful, though eccentric, aging screen star, is trying to show that she can make it on her own. So she learns how to make unique desserts and opens, without assistance from Mother, Decadent Dlights, a chocolate lover's eating paradise. But Ali's a soft-shoulder, a sucker for any animal or any person who needs rescuing. This has caused varying degrees of success and failure in her personal life.In walks Matt Baker, a newly arrived handyman who keeps to himself. He's antisocial, but his work is good. Yet there's something about thim that indicates he has problems and he needs rescuing. Of course, this situation intrigues Ali and she's determined to find him out, then help him out.In addition to the emotional roller coasters within and between the two main characters, Ali's mother and Miss Sylvie are a story and a riot, by themslelves. SWEET SUCCESS, a modern-day romance, is well worth the read."
4,Street Photographer's Best Friend,"I have gone through dozens of bags over my decade long tenure as a photographer. The bags for professional shoots are easy to select. They have to be big, and strong, and offer tons of protection. However, its the bags for personal street photography that offer the biggest challenge. They have to fit the following requirements: 1, they must make it very easy to reach your gear, and change lenses on the fly. 2. They have to be ergonomic and comfortable. 3. They must not make you stand out. I have eyed the Domke FX3 for a very long time, but honestly, could not justify $150 for a compact canvas bag. Having owned it now for only a few street photography outings, I repent of my short sighted procrastination. The bag is designed by a photographer, for a photographer. It is very rugged and has everything you need, and nothing you don't. Nothing has to be squeezed in. It fits perfectly. I highly recommend it."
1,First Family,"We could not even watch the whole movie. After 10 minutes, the movie shook and then went blank. We were so disappointed."
5,As funny as always,"There's no show like Married with Children and each season it gets better! I'm glad it's available to purchase. It is the best cancelled TV show in TV history, there's no other humor like it. Hilarious"
1,7 of these episodes are syndicated versions,"I was getting ready to place an order for this season set, but fortunately I found a review that informed me that 7 of the episodes are the shorter syndicated versions with missing footage. I can watch this for free on cable TV. I would no more buy a DVD set with missing footage than I would buy a book with missing pages."
2,Superficial,The book was awesome and kept me interested and intrigued to the end. There was not enough time in the movie to create the depth that was present in the book. Thus it was a superficial experiencial recap of the book instead of what could have been a great insightfull movie. I would reread the book before rewatching the movie. So Sad.
5,Short and sweet,"Missed a lot of info from the book, But got the point in the movie. It was very well done, show all your friends, Can't wait till they make another movie on other parts of the book."
5,Great Movie,"An excellent film with a timely message. Faithful to the book, a visually beautiful movie everyone should see. Gives us hope that things can change for the better if we work for our own enlightenment."
3,The Celestine Prophecy,"It's okay, but the adaptation didn't work out too well from the books, which I would recommend for the early 'fool' on their journey. The lessons are presented in the books much better than this film, which seems to gloss over them too fast. That's part of the problem in putting such subject matter to visual form."
1,Why cant we watch this on a computer?,This is a bad move Amazon! A computer is well equipped to play HD. But in your sheer greed you made it where I have to go use another device. Probably exclusive royalties. I pay for my prime membership and you pull this. I will renew my membership one more time but if you do not allow us PC users to watch it on our computers then I will not renew after that.
1,"Loved the Books, Hate the Movie (dislike is a better word)","I have tried to watch this movie several times, and invariably I end up falling asleep on it. The series of books are so dynamic and prolific. I especially loved the Celestine Prophecy. Maybe that dynamism can't be translated onto film? I find the movie boring and hard to get into. It's a pity because the book is fabulous and chock-full of useful information even though it's mostly fiction."
1,What if a Simple Plot and Poor Acting Are in the Same Movie?,"Have you ever seen a movie with a plot so transparent that you can predict several scenes out? Do you enjoy films performed by people that make you long for the relatively high quality acting of 1980's television shows like the ""A-Team""? If so, then this movie is for you.Serioulsy, I would suggest that if you want to explore other exotic cultures and spirituality, that you save your money for a trip to South America instead of purchasing this film."
4,Spiritually uplifting.,"I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 simply because of the acting and rushed story line, but the message is substantial. Ancient scrolls are discovered in Peru that offer spiritual enlightenment. The main character is an American history teacher that, after loosing his job, travels to Peru to investigate the rumored scrolls and he becomes spiritually awakened along the way. I think the message of auras, intuition, and empowering others is worth viewing."
1,Returned item,"Bottom line this stapler does not fit staples made by Arrow, T 50 staples are to big !Could not find any staples that will fit this stapler in any local hardware store.Other wise this might be a good stapler ?"
1,Sorry Product!,"I purchased this product to upholster a chair. I ran three staple sleeves through it and it stop ""shooting"" out staples, just air. I returned and purchased a different upholstery staple gun. I DO NOT recommend this product."
5,Good unit,"I specifically bought this to work on some upholstered chairs and I'm pleased.I bought some of the Arrow staples plus the staples recommended for it. I'm pleased with the unit, especially for the price."
2,Had to send it back,"We ordered the surebonder upholstery stapler to do a project, when I found this one at this low price I ordered it, alas--it's true, you get what you pay for! We tried to get it to shoot more than one staple at a time, the plunger would not bring another staple up to make it continuous, nothing worked to try to fix it, so we ordered a much more expensive stapler to finish our project"
4,Great thumb drive... not as advertised,"The thumb drive works well, is properly detected on the first try, and the performance is much faster than I expected. The only thing that makes me sad is that what arrived looks nothing like the picture. The image on the website depicts a sturdy-looking drive that appears to have a brushed metal casing. The actual drive is made out of a plastic casing that is almost flimsy.I have had no problems with this drive and it performs better than I expected, but I was hoping for something with a stronger casing, since the only reason I needed one was for packing up my home office to go to the other office from time to time.Overall, I'm happy with the drive, I just subtracted a star because it is NOT AS ADVERTISED. The description is correct, the picture is not this drive."
2,annual purchase,"We've stopped by our local JC Penney that carries this band & enjoyed its dual controls. They work well, as does the pre-heating of the bed. However, we've had to purchase a new one almost every 1-2y because the blanket starts to develop cold spots, then no longer work on 1 side or the other, despite our idea to try avoid washing in conventional washer that may damage the heating elements. No particular reason for the elements to die, wasn't folded, taken on/off, bent, traumatized, etc. We're trying another brand from now on"
1,Same Bad Sunbeam Product Here!,"I agree with another reviewer, this is an item that I have to purchase every year. I purchased 2 Sunbeams heating/electric blankets last year in winter 2006. They worked great for the winter season. Hooked them up this winter 2007 year and both of them are dead. I just purchased another one but I am going to take it back because, after doing this review, I realized I wasted a lot of money last year with those Sunbeam products. Purchase at your own risk!"
4,Funny!,I have always loved this show. Glad to own it and not have to sit through a ton of commercials. The only down side is the crappy theme music. The producers lost the rights to the original theme music somehow and the music they replaced it with is HORRIBLE. I usually fast forward through it but if you are watching episodes back to back that can be disruptive and quite annoying.
4,THE LAST GREAT SEASON,This is the final season in which the show was great...the following seasons are all very mediocre....This season continues the trend that started in Season 5 of turning Al and the rest of the family into cartoon characters (as opposed to the first 4 seasons where the show relied on sharp edged humor) But the material is still strong enough to get by so the show does not become a parody of itself as it did in following seasons....
5,RCA Cable,"This cable is working. Not much more can be said. I am using it for the connection to my sub-woofer from my surround and have no problem. The last cable I tried (a 25ft RCA extension cable) gave a very loud 60Hz hum when plugged into the receiver but this cable is apparently shielded correctly to preven this. The quality is very good so if you need a long, shielded, RCA male to male cable I would strongly recomend this one."
1,frustrating,"Perelman catalogs a litany of injustices (perceived and real) associated with intellectual property. The injustices themselves are fairly interesting, but Perelman's analysis is shrill and unashamedly biased - every case builds into his thesis that intellectual property is evil and must be replaced...But this is the biggest problem with the book - 150 pages of criticism of the system that builds to a crescendo of NOTHING. At the end of the book he reveals that he doesn't have any idea of how the system could be improved or what it could be replaced with; even an implausible or unworkable suggestion would be better than none at all.In the end I was left disappointed but not altogether unsurprised."
3,latch n hook,"I was very disappointed that the hook was not included here. I gave this to my niece, when she opened it, no hook. Why?"
4,Colors are confusing,I bought it and it is impossible to follow on the canvas - only if you look at chart. I'm not a begginer but this kit drives me crazy. Colors on the canvas very confusing. They dont represent the actual color of yarn. I tried to finish this project couple times but I really dont like it.
3,Berlin School of EM,"This band is like mid-period Tangerine Dream (Sorcerer, Tangram era). Good sequencer and lead synth lines. Each song starts out simple and builds. Not on par with Air Sculpture, Kubbuschnitt, or Arcane...but it is worth adding to your collection. I wish Amazon.com carried the Neu Harmony label. Neu Harmony has signed the best European electronic music groups there are!"
3,A bit bulky,"As expected from Lowepro, the filter pocket is well made and very durable.Perhaps there is no way to avoid it, but I find it too bulky for everyday use. I would be willing to sacrifice a bit of padding for a more compact design.I only take this along with I'm planning on an extended photo outing and want to bring along a bunch of filters. Otherwise, I find it more convenient to just use regular filter holders and slip a filter or two into my pocket."
5,Fantastic,"If you have Scots blood in your veins, or in your heart, this is it...Incredible, thought provoking...must have"
5,Spritual and thought provoking,"Byron did an excellent job of taking the reader along on his paddle....spiritually, mentally, and physically. He appreciation for the land and it's people was quite evident and gives the reader a new perspective and greater understanding of each. I appreciated Byron's honesty about spirituality and his insights. Very thought provoking!Would suggest having a map of the Inside Passage handy to follow their travels as you read."
5,Love this CD,"I was listening to an internet stream of indie radio; when Mushroom Cloud came on I sat up and took notice. I bought the CD and it's all excellent. Some of the language is pretty strong but the musicianship is strong too, sometimes surprisingly lush with nice harmonies. And Mushroom Cloud is brilliant and amusingly unapologetic in its testosterone overdrive. I gave this CD five stars because there isn't a skip-over song in the entire lineup. Get it - you won't be disappointed!"
1,Tryly the worse movie i ever ....,"Te worse language you can possible imagine.Senseless, almost child pornography. Final words at the end are the most low class end you can possible imagine.Go ahead waste your time and then come back and write about this ""movie"" if we can call it that.PS: keep in mind that i am a huge fan of Ricardo Darin, but not on this one Richard!"
1,"This SECTOR watch, NO RIABILITY!","Not waterproof, twice checked in warranty, after-sales service unable. After all, I hear that waterproof is not technically possible. The technical description said : WATERPROOF 10 atm. (100 meters)! And now, warranty period ended!!!"
3,Good Stuff,"My son was willing to take the liquid form but says it tastes horrible. He requests the capsule form and we are in the process of ordering it soon. I could tell a difference after two doses, its not a miracle but did seem to calm him some. I would buy it again."
3,No all is as expected,"Love the drill. Works great and does everything I expected ...except, it didn't arrive with the advertised ""on-tool stud finder"". That was curious and disappointing but not a deal-breaker. Other than that, this was yet another satifactory Amazon marketplace experience."
4,Typical buther block oil but good,I think you end up paying some for the name but overall the product is good. It's quickly absorbed into the board and ends up darkening it a little which i personally think makes it look even better. I've been using it every couple of weeks and the board is holding up nicely so far.
4,John Boss Block Oil,Does what it's suppose to do. Can't ask for any thing else. I have several blocks and use them often. I keep them fresh and prevent the hardwood from drying out by applying John Boos Oil to them. I recommend this product.
1,The item description is conflicting,"In Amazon's product specifications, it says the ingredients are mineral oil, linseed oil and tung oil. Further below, the actual product description says the ingredients are mineral oil, linseed oil and orange oil. So which is it? But actually, it's only the mineral oil that is needed to treat the wood and you can buy mineral oil anywhere for dirt cheap. Linseed oil may contain petroleum products, a definite no-no for food surfaces and can go rancid. Walnut oil or a walnut oil/beeswax mix is best for treating butcher blocks. And to those in the previous reviews that are using this oil on stainless steel and other surfaces, are you kidding? Any surface looks better when you rub any type of oil on it but it only attacts dust and dirt. I guess it would be appropriate to rub oil on such surfaces if your home is on display, but for everyday living, it would be totally inappropriate."
4,How can something flammable/explosive be OK for food?!,"I liek the oil, and use it on my Oak boards. But how many flammable/explosive foods can you think of?!Love the oil, but it does make you think..."
1,Reasonable quality imported item that is marked Made in USA...,"Gotta love a product that has USA stamped into the piece and comes with a Made in China label.As to the quality, hey, it's a carabineer. Does what it is supposed to. But if marketing department is so haphazard, what does that say about the rest of QC at the company?Jan 9, 2012: After emailing the company, I find out in fact this IS made in China. Apparently, they have no problems selling an item marked Black Diamond USA that is made in China?What is the world coming to? In the past month I have bought product from Black Diamond, Ingersoll-Rand and Crescent here on Amazon, NONE of which was marked as an import. I realize US labels need to remain competitive, but give the consumer a choice."
2,Not so good,"Cheaply made and the screen is covered by the clear plastic which covers the entire front, so you can't use the touch screen with the stylet. The belt clip snaps in and out only with difficulty. Can't recommend this item."
1,ariived 18 days late and broken,"I bought a vaporiser from Half Baked and it arrived more than 2 weeks after stated delivery time. This I can live with. But it wasn't packed carefully and the glass bowl was broken. When I asked for a replacement bowl, I was told to file an insurance claims with the Post Office, or buy a replacement. I live in small town and do not want to file at the Post Ofiice. Having already paid over $70, I do not want to spend more money.Half Baked should have packed the glass parts securely, like wrapped the bowl in tissue and taped it down. Half Baked should repalce the broken part and not blow me off. Does Half baked mean their customer service is Half Baked?"
4,NOT GETTING THE ATTENTION IT DESERVES,"This new album from Pushmonkey is a great record, with standout tracks like Stuck Out, 10,000 Miles, Sorry and The Greatest. It's a shame that not many people have heard of them. I think more people need to check out this band. They are definantly going somewhere."
4,Excellent Resource,"This is an excellent book that should be on any working photographer's shelf. I bought this book to help me wright the contract for my first paying job as a professional photographer. I was able to use the form as a guideline to create a formal letter to be signed by both parties and serve as a contract. The author explained each section of the form, what it meant, and why it was there. Based on that information I was able to decide what I needed in my letter and what wasn't needed. The only complaint I have is that the author suggests ""If an assignment will be very lengthy, perhaps requiring a number of sessions over a period of months, a schedule of payments should be used"" but he fails to demonstrate how to write that. Still a most excellent book."
3,A little out dated,"This book is a little outdated, but is very useful in writing you own form. Most of the forms on the disk can't be customized using newer word processing software."
5,"Excellent, for the beginner as well!","I was a beginner when I bought this book and found it excellent from the start! Unlike mr. Chapin's book, this one contains a clear explanation on how to do the exercises (when to use each limb). Also, it doesn't look like it's some kind of photocopy (like the Chapin book).So I would definitely recommend it to beginners who want to develop independence of the limbs from the start. And let's face it, ""an endless supply of patience"" is what everybody needs to learn how to play his/her instrument perfectly.By the way, how can you honestly call yourself an advanced drummer if you still need to do these exercises to get your feet and hands disconnected?"
2,"outdated, just alot of notes","I have been playing drums for over 30 years and am looking for a good book to teach my son. I was disappointed by this book and am returning it. It is very dry, and has measure after measure, page after page of practice rhythms.By today's standards, this book falls short on written verbage to fully explore and motivate. This is what I need to capture and keep the attention of a 10 year old student.This book has indeed shown the test of time, and would probably be of value to an older, disciplined drummer simply looking for exercise transcripts to develop independence."
4,4-way coordination,"Who plays this book from beginning to the end, it takes maybe little more time expected, but who plays properly these exercises has certainly much much better coordination and control after. It doesn`t have many musical exercises, but after this book you should be able to play musical songs in another level and with much better coordination."
4,Good for amateurs and general purposes,Pros:Great product for those who requires amplify a dynamic mic.We use for vocals in a karaoke system with excellent results. It doesn't requires expensive microphones. With cheaper mics produces good sound.Cons: The preamp doesn't has a power on/off switch so you must to plug/unplug the DC adapter. It is a little expensive but works fine.
3,Gold Collection?,"Above average compilation with some of Sheena Eastons' Hits. This isn't a CD that the casual listener would really enjoy. Three of Sheena's best are included here ""Morning Train"" (also performed by Sylvie Vartan), ""Modern Girl"", & ""For your eyes only"" (from the movie with the same title). Some songs are missing from this collection ... & yes, ""The Wind Beneath My Wings"" is one of them...The ""GREATEST HITS"" album is much more superior than this one."
3,Toyota Repair manual,"It has what I need to repair almost everything on the Toyota Camry I just bought used. Unfortunately it doesn't have repair information on the Air Conditioning, probably for good reasons....."
5,Best Locker Bag I've ever owned!,"I have owned two OGIO locker bags over the past twenty plus years. They are relatively expensive, but worth every penney! They wear very well and allow you to organize your ""stuff."""
4,"If I love this bag, why am I looking for a new gym bag?","I have had this bag for several years now and it looks like new. Great for organizational nuts like myself and it has a nice lined pocket for wet swim suits, caps and goggle. So why am I looking for a new gym bag? It is big and awkward. I find myself using a tiny bag for days I don't swim and moving things back to this one when I swim. Time consuming and I have forgotten to switch things more than once. To be fair I am short and that is half the issue but it is still cumbersome ..."
4,Awesome gym bag,"I wanted a gym bag that I didn't need to cram sideways into a locker on top of my chlothes and one that took up less floor space in my car trunk than a typical gym bag. This bag is very functional for keeping clothes and gear organized in a locker and functioning as its own locker. If it was a couple of inches wider and a couple of inches shorter, it would still fit in the locker, my shoes would fit iinside better and it would take up less space on its side in my trunk. The bag spends time upright (in the locker), on its back (easier to pack that way), and on its side (in the trunk). Deodarant doesn't stay in the available pockets because of this. I have no need for and recycled the accompanying bottles."
4,Better in real life,Excellent product - forces you to only carry what you need - good discipline. Enclosed bottles could be a bit better.
4,Ogio Locker Bag,"Bag not as good as the original, but very good. Great for gym lockers my last one lasted 10 years. Open the bag door all the way against it's side and slide it in to the locker. Now you have easy access. Get nylon bags for your wet clothes and shower shoes."
4,22 Hits - Here's the track list,"This refers to Time-Life Music R984-33.Track list:1. Cry Like a Baby - Box Tops2. I Think We're Alone Now - Tommy James & Shondells3. Last Train to Clarksville - Monkees4. Sloop John B - Beach Boys5. Both Sides Now - Judy Collins6. Spinning Wheel - Blood, Sweat & Tears7. Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In - 5th Dimension8.

4,The insights and subtleties of the beach game,"As an avid reader of volleyball books I am forever searching for ways to improve my game. Most books assume you are starting from scratch and fill the pages with basic skills, drills and photos. Tanner's insights into this great game emphasizes the basics but goes beyond to clue us into some of the lesser known but very important subtleties of the game. Herein lies this small books value. These are secrets to success that can only be arrived at by playing the game at a very successful level. Tanner has done this and has put out a great little book full of these insights for the rest of us to use! Just a suggestion for a second book... a book filled with pictures or diagrams depicting common and not so common situations in a beach court and how the author would handle them."
5,It doesn't get better than this...,"If you're already a good player this book will take you to the next level. If you've got mediocre skills it's not going to do much for you because you haven't ""arrived"" at a mental/experience level good enough to take advantage of it. I loved the book and would recommend it to any one who wants to get better. Sure, you can go buy a book from Karch Kiraly but all it's going to do is tell you how to pass, set, and hit. His books, along with other ""super stars"" are geared for everyone, experienced or not. Like the book description says...it's for serious players wanting to improve their game. Don't buy the book expecting it to be a picture library...buy it because you're serious about volleyball and want a mental edge on your opponents."
5,This is one of her favorite toys!,This is a class toy. She will play with it for hours. She like sorting and putting the blocks back on the board time after time.
5,Great Book for Intro to Analysis,"This is a very good book for someone to look at before going into an analysis class with Rudin. If you have never done proofs or seen metric spaces or uniform continuity, etc., this is a nice, but brief, intro. This book will NOT teach you analysis - you have to use Rudin for that. But it is great for acquainting/preparing you for Rudin."
2,Copy control is terrible,"This C.D has great songs, but because of some terrible copy protection added by E.M.I. it won't play in my car cd player only on my home stereo. Don't buy it, get a version that will play in your car."
4,Good read,"Good book, pretty easy read. I think all people who drink should read this regardles of they have a problem."
1,Early Raitt,"Clearly this is an early effort by Bonnie Raitt. You can hear where she's heading, but I listened to this CD once or twice and then retired it."
4,Watch out for glue,"This is a fantastic box set, and I echo the comments of the readers who have gone into more detail about the actual musical contents. What I want to alert folks to is that this box set, like a number of them manufactured at a certain point, used a particular adhesive in the construction of the box and digipacks which ""runs"" over time (regardless of heat). I discovered this to my dismay when I opened my coveted Instrumental Box recently to find the digipacks literally glued to the interior of the box! So, if you're buying any of these used, be sure to ask if there's any glue damage, and if possible, ask for photos of the digipacks opened up etc."
3,Marketing at its Best,"A Marketer's dream if there ever was one. Be aware you're paying for the absolutely gorgeous, nifty, beautifully conceived packaging.And to really make fans drool there's a Volume One AND a Volume Two.And both volumes feel weighty and IMPORTANT TO OWN.Your friends will be in awe. You'll tell everybody you know you own BOTH volumes.You'll tell your friends This is Brilliant Concept.You'll be sure to tell your friends either ""It cost me a fortune"" or better: ""I bought it when it First Came Out!!!""Anyway you look at it the whole is better than the parts and the songs don't feel ""right"" collected and bumped up and squeezed together in a way that feels crammped.Discreet music is butchered ""to fit"".You can live without it.Really, it's just a pretty albeit, very pretty two volume package you're paying for.It's really an Art Object; or rather a set of Art Objects.Sculptures, if you will.Obsessive (I must Own Everything with Eno's name on it) collector's only."
1,Bonsai was an illusion,"Unfortunately this bonsai didn't even make it for 6 weeks. It arrived looking very healthy but after a couple of weeks it started to drop leaves, then the leaves started to turn brown and now less than 8 weeks later it is dead.I have been collecting and maintaining bonsai plants for over 25 years and gave this one the good care all of my other plants get....something was obviously wrong..perhaps over fertilization... that caused it to look great upon arrival but then just fizzle out. I don't know....but it is now dead and I took very good care of it and am very disappointed."
2,Very disappointing video choices,"I bought this Naxos DVD musical traveloque of Switzerland, hoping it would be better than the Naxos one I bought of France, with music of Faure. This one is worse. Granted, the Schubert music is great, and there are some nice vistas of mountains and streams, but with all the breath-taking scenery available in Switzerland, why the long study of railroad tracks, tunnels, cows, clouds, sprinklers, roads and a cat?! PLEASE - give me those gorgeous valleys and lakes. If only Rick Steves had provided the video instead of Mom and Pop tourist. And then when we see images of alp horns, cow bells and children singing, we hear only Schubert. Better to buy a good travel of Swizterland, and put on a CD of music as you watch."
1,Buyer Beware,"I have been buying ""Chuck It"" ball throwers since they first came out and I used to love them. BUT NOW they have resized the holder so you must buy their Balls, it NO LONGER HOLDS REGULAR TENNIS BALLS. I feel they have defrauded me and I am disappointed in them because the packaging does not tell you this! It is very misleading. To buy the Chuck it sized Balls YOU MUST buy them from them and they charge $13.99 for these balls. FYI regular tennis balls go for about $1.00 each. Don't be a sucker!"
4,A Good Album For the Lightfoot Fan,"This is solid folk music, albeit a bit too slow-paced throughout. There's no need to discuss the classic song IF YOU COULD READ MY MIND, for anyone who's looking at this review, or knows of Lightfoot knows all too well about that one.Throughout this album, the writing is pensive, if not somber. There's some attempts at humor in SATURDAY CLOTHES, but the slow pace of the song almost pulls it under.Without doubt, BABY IT'S ALLRIGHT is the most upbeat song on the album, and dare I say Lightfoot's closest ""rock"" song.It is interesting to note that this is Gord's first album with heavy instrumentation and production, and he pulls off some of the most beautiful harmonies, and background notes ever written.It probably should stand as one of Gord's greatest, and his purist fans might bristle at it not receiving 5-stars, but compared to his later album SUNDOWN, a listener might agree that IF YOU COULD READ MY MIND isn't quite as powerful an album as some of his other works."
4,A very good folk album that was his breakthrough in the States,"Gordon Lightfoot / If you could read my mind: ""Read my mind"" was his great breakthrough hit in the United States (although he had been making some very fine albums in Canada for some time). The rest of the album is very enjoyable and his take on ""Me and Bobbie McGee"" is excellent, but overall the album is good, not great, and rates four stars."
4,Good for very small ponds,"Not what I needed, but useful for very small ponds if you don't have a waterfall or some type of aeration. I purchased this for algae control, but ended up getting a larger filter with UV light that cleared the pond."
4,Good product,It worked good for us until it got cold. I think our climate is too cold for it. We will use it in the summer though.
4,An Old But Valuable Treatise on Evil,"Paul Ricoeur here leads a very helpful conversation on evil--a subject that is difficult to define yet is necessary for all to consider. It is not easy, bedtime reading as, like most philosophic and theological books, it takes time and effort to grasp his concepts. Our human problem is that we find it so difficult to see into our own complicity with evil because we are too close to it. Ricoeur offer us some help."
5,Want to begin creating or refining your skills?,"This book is not for the absolute begginer mountain biker. This book has helped me refine my skills. Maybe every other night I'll plop down in bed and reach past the Mists of Avalon to a slightly lighter piece of paper. Within two minuets I am pumped to go try to pop a wheelie or climb a hill. This book is filled with wit, insperation, and great little tips that we don't all do naturally."
3,The LP is much better,"This album is good, but only if you have it on vinyl. The song ""What did you do to my life"" is mixed very badly on the cd, with that sort of droning incredibly irritating organ sound. This is only one instance of the poor transfer to digital that occured with this cd. It is on one of the best songs on the album, but just sounds horrible on the cd. I don't think they put this one out on vinyl since the early eighties, I was lucky to get it from an old neighbor. On LP, ""what did you do to my life,"" without the bad electronic noises, gives the album a cohesion that it otherwise lacks. Does anyone else out there know what I'm talking about? The rest of the album lacks the rich production level of the LP. It's almost like it's a completely different album. I know--this is Neil Young minutia, but I just can't get over how bad this album sounds on cd."
2,"Yes, it's a Lowepro but NOT S&F","It WILL connect to your Tech belt. But it's a pretty cheap build. It almost looks like a knock-off. A small strip of Velcro holds the flap down and underneath is a drawstring pocket. There is no cool little rain shield that pops out from underneath so use my favorite and yours, Scotch Guard ( I should get a commission eery time I mention their name). Even with Scotch Guard, i wouldn't put anything more expensive than a really, really good sandwich in this case."
2,Poor choice for binoculars,"As promoted, this item is suggested for use with binoculars. The draw tight hood is a constant pain when trying to replace your field glasses back into the pouch. If the draw cord opening were off to one side this would greatly improve the design, but because of its location, their is no way to really get around it, or to fold it out of the way. This problem seems to be an annoying design oversight. The size of this pouch is also too tight or narrow to insert or remove a mid to full-sized pair of binoculars easily. Slightly larger width and depth (1/2"") would have been better. Using the Lowepro S&F Technical Belt (an excellent product), I was hopeful that this pouch would have become a primary tool when birding. I learned otherwise."
5,"Snug Fit for Nikon 18-135mm f/3.5-5,6 G ED DX Lens w/ Reversed Hood",The case fits the 18-135mm lens reviewed at [...] perfectly with space to put the reversed hood around the lens as well.
1,Disappionted but pleased with the refund.,THis was my second order of this product the first order was OUTSTANDING but the second was terrible. Hope the manufacture can return to the original quality. Amazon needs to TEST and promote the quality of this product if/when it is restocked with good quality.
2,Smiling but not funny --,Enjoyed Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder in other films but this one lack hitting my funny bone. Richard looked painfully ill in this flick which probably contributed to the lack of chemistry in humor among this men.
5,A Great American Songwriter,This is a great CD from one of the finest singer / songwriters currently putting out material. It is a very insightful collection of songs that deserve to be heard. Jason put's on one helluva live show as well. If you have never seen him live do yourself a favor and check him out. If you have I'll see you at the show next time he's in town.
2,A Real Disappointment,"I bought this book because of the rave reviews on Amazon.com, but I was disappointed. ""Wing Ding"" isn't especially well-written, and it provides little information about the air war in Europe that you couldn't learn from a mission log. The best part of the book is its description of life on the ground, especially including the author's consistent efforts to get around orders and his amazing ability to carry on a number of amorous relationships at the same time."
5,Billy Bunny,"This book is beautifully illustrated. It is my son's favorite book and we read it almost every night. He cannot read yet, but he loves to uncover the animals behind the pop-up's. He is delighted when he finds the animals. The last page is full of butterflies and he always sqeals in delight."
5,A must have for your camera lenses,Lowepro cases are a must have for all your lenses. Protect you equipment - lenses are not inexpensive. I even put my lenses in the case and then in the pockets of my camera bag for extra protection - especially from the security agents at airports that seem to get some fun out of shoving your bags into others and even off the table (which has happened to my camera bag twice after going through the xray!).
4,A Pity !!,Its a pity and such a waste that such brave and really good soldiers fought for such an evil cause. Fate can be really cruel but it just goes to show that courage will not be on just one side of a fight. Good illustrations and a fairly good text
1,boring beyond belief,"If you enjoy reading hyper-intellectual bloviating pontificating verbiage about very little, then this is the book for you. A gift from a friend, I expected to be uplifted by this book, and to learn more about Jesus, but instead I found very little about Jesus at all. It is telling that I had to go to basically the middle of the book to actually find scripture. This is a book by man with no Spirit in it. The Catholic church has nothing to fear from this book. Most will be dead by boredom long before they finish."
1,No other name,"There's not much left to Christ after you get through this destruction of Catholic belief concerning Christ.The author tries to be trendy and cutting edge. But we've heard it all before---and Rousseau writes better. This is Jesus cut down to human size, more specifically to the size of a liberal-left social reformer.The Beatitudes as bumper sticker.Read John Paul II's Redemptor hominis for some real Christology."
1,Buyer beware,"Although the book claims to offer a Catholic Christology, it simply repeats the old Enlightenment view of Jesus as moral sage, the best man, the ideal prophet. A purely human Jesus and certainly not the one and only savior of the world.Tendentious misinterpretation of doctrinal history meets Blowing in the Wind theology."
2,3/4 of the book are a complete waste of money,"the book is very good in the beginning, giving you some good extra information, about when to start preparation, and explaining the us scholar system, additionally it says where you'll be able to work and how much you're expected to earn, let's say a lot of useful informationBut 3/4 of the book is just a stupid list of all the colleges + universities! A list with lots more of information can be found on their website www.collegeboard.com !(you can even compare 2 or 3 different schools!). I don't know if there's a better book, but this one isn't really worth buying. It seems to be pretty large, but if you consider just the ""written"" part, it shrinks to the size of a small booklet....."
5,Fun at the Ritz,"I have had a VHS copy of this movie for years and have watched it so much I think the tape has worn out. Wow, the quality of this DVD makes the movie brand new again. Picture is very bright and a joy to watch. I can recite almost evey line but I still laugh like crazy. It is one of the funniest movies out there. What a cast! Rita Moreno at her best! If you have never seen this movie buy it and laugh yourself to tears. If you have seen it buy this DVD to re-experience the fun and craziness of a completely zany movie."
5,Camp on! Camp on!,"Not at all politically correct, but absolutely hysterical. Sometimes gross and over the top humor as in the original version of the Producers. I watch this comedy at least once a year."
5,One of the best comedies ever!!!,This is a must see for anyone who loves to see a broadway play turned into a perfect film.
2,Too much talking,There was way too much talking about what the three of them do. The actual jump rope work out should have been longer than 15 minutes but I guess this is good if you have never jumped rope before but you will eventually need to buy the advance to get a real work out.
1,ropesport,"I like the video, it's informative and helpful for beginners, plus the one trainers body is HOT, so it gives you the incentive to do this ropesport and hopefully after you've mastered it, we'll all have a body like his! WOW!"
4,Japanese schlock for Ultra Fun,I grew up watching Ultraman and have always enjoyed the television show. I knew to expect goofy monsters with model buildings that go crunch. I got what I expected and thoroughly enjoyed it. My son loved it so here begins the next generations of fans.
1,Deficientes,"Estos relojes son de mala calidad, no soportan dos viajes a la playa, se dañan sus componentes y despues tienes que cambiarlos, pero si los compras por internet, la garantia no es validad, asi que no digan que los compraron por esta via."
5,God Save the Kinks,VGPS is a Classic Kinks Album. Raymond Davies recalls a time when life was simple. It's a joy to hear the Kinks recalling the bliss of the village Green or singing about old Johnny Thunder riding down the highway. Telling the tale of a picture book or remembering Walter. Davis takes great joy in the simple things in every day life and helps us to realize how precious life is.. Listen to the Kinks. What more can we do?
4,Great. But under-produced.,"I've always heard others say this is the greatest Kinks album.It's a great album, but IMO compared to their other albums, it has a slightly dull production quality to it.Their next album, Arthur, seems to -audibly- jump off the record,(CD), player. Same with Lola-Powerman and Muswell Hillbillies."
2,Sorry lads - too whimsical,"I am a huge fan of the Kinks, both their early stuff and late stuff. In fact, it is really this album that lets them down. Maybe it just reminds me too much of the irritating Sgt. Pepper. But it might be because there are only three songs on the album that are worth listening to - the title track, that I love, and then ""Big Sky"" and ""Starstruck"". The rest of them would never stand up for themselves when not supported by the concept. It is a statement of Ray Davies' writing ethos, and so has become to be the Kinks' definitive album. But there's nothing as good as the late 60s singles here."
4,Going with Godric,"An excellent insight into the world of the 1100s in Britain and the struggles we all encounter in our search for fulfilment and sanctitiy. Godric emerges as a complete human--I could almost smell his unwashed clothes and body--as he details his adventures both temporal and spiritual. The ""dialect"" speech never falters. An excellent read which I finished in 3 days."
4,A good start; very promising,"I didn't like either the beginning or the end of this book, but I loved the middle part (everything except the first two or three pages up until the last two or three pages). I look forward to reading the later books, I'm sure they will be very good. It has all the elements of a good conspiracy: aliens, government, underground reporters, and enough ""real life"" facts to make impressionable readers even more paranoid."
4,The Market Place of Revolution,This book helps the reader understand the importance of unity in revolution. It show how the Patriots develope this unity. The reader should have a basic knowledge of the revolution and the effort of the boycot of British goods
1,Piece of crap...waste of money...,"This is another example of why we should move manufacturing jobs back to the USA. I'm so tired of buying cheaply made crap made in China and this is a great example of shoddy workmanship. This thing beeps at you constantly and there are no directions that show you how to program it not to beep or how to shut off the section you don't want a temperature reading from. In fact, I don't even think I received instructions in English. It seems very flakey and I did not get a correct temp read when I probed it with my trusty old meat thermometer. Save yourself the cash and buy a product made in the USA (or Europe) if you can find one anymore...at least you'll know there were higher standards and you'll be aware of what materials are in the product."
1,Almost the perfect product,"I purchased several of these units because they were the perfect product for smoking (aka barbecue). Based on the information provided they would allow me to monitor the internal temperature of the meat in the pit AND allow me to keep tabs on the ambient air around the meat inside the pit. What more could a serious barbecue enthusiast ask, right?Of the ones I purchased, only one reads the correct temperature after a single cook. Just one. Did I mention that I purchased six of them? In speaking with Polder customer service I was told that this unit was not designed for the application I describe. Instead, it is designed to take an instant reading in the meat while in the oven, and then remove the probe from the oven. WHAT? Why have the additional sensor? Why not just buy a temperature fork?Based on my experience with this product and the customer support, I cannot recommend this product. Honestly, I think the new probe units with the dual sensors might be defective."
4,Precision Pet Deluxe Great Crate - Copper,"After shopping local stores carrying pet supplies, I was unable to find a crate with a removable door. Finally discovered this one on amazon.com and was pleasantly surprised to find a color other than black or silver.There were a couple of spots on the finish that slightly chipped during assembly - which did not require tools.A couple of wire posts ending at the bottom of the door opening have slightly sharp spots which I intend to cover with pvc pipe. My puppy is very small and the posts could scratch his belly when entering/exiting the kennel.Other than those two things, I am very happy with this crate!"
4,good for the price,I probably should have read the dimensions before I purchased because it looks like standard size can in the photo but it's actually a kinda mini size. Not a huge deal but something to consider if you're adding this to your existing lights. The cable is really short which could be a good or bad depending how near your dimmers you're hanging it. But it's got the same construction you'd see in any can so I'm happy with it.
5,Holds wide angle,This is what I have been looking for a affordable lens case that will hold a 72mm diameter lens. It has a sturdy loop on back to attach to a belt or even to the outside of a bag. No more juggling lenses while walking down the street. Now keep in mind I paid about $11.00 for it I see it is listed at $20+ I would not pay that much for it though. It fits my Tokina 12-24mm 72mm diameter and also my Sigma 50-200mm so it should work for most med size lenses.
4,Padding doesn't seem like it might prevent a fall,"I got this thinking it could help to protect my lens. However in my opinion there is not enough padding to protect a lens from a fall. The only thing this lens case does is protect against water spill, other than that it just cosmetic"
5,Perfect for may small / standard lenses,"Bought this one month ago and I like this product.Pros: Perfect on my Tamron 17-50 F2.8, EF85 F1.8, EF-S 10-22 F3.5-4.5 (A little tight though), convenient at outdoor use, good paddingCons: Some may feel a little too tight"
5,Perfect ft for Canon 10-22 and 28-135 lenses,"I only have the two lenses. the case attaches simply to my lowenpro bag. Easy on easy off. Snug, but not a tight fit on either lens. I like keeping the lens attached but not in the camera bag, easily removed so i do not need to catrry it in one lens situations."
5,Perfect for several different lenses,"This lens case fits any one of several of my lenses: 10-22mm wide angle lens, 100mm macro lens, 17-85mm zoom lens. I attach this to my Tamrac Velocity 7 by the same type of attachment system that Tamrac uses for all of thier products. A flap slides into the available MAS system slot on the camera bag and is secured VERY securely with a double locking velcro strap system. This leaves plenty of room in the bag for my camera and other gear. Nicely padded to protect your lens investment."
2,Da good folks from Tennesee tried!....,"Da good folks from Tennesee tried!.... But hardly raining stars for this one.., Couldn't tell you if seasoned actors could've pulled this script off... It came off as if every character was preachy... A real nice cover though, but even the previously used dvd cost was over pricing the ""HYPE""..., The camera quality & the stage sets got on my nerve, the sound,script and some of the acting wasn't quite up to snuff either (grade C+)..."
5,Good quality.,"Great for smaller lenses. Just barely fits my d40 kit zoom lens, but that's not what I bought it for. Feels well protected."
4,Nice covers,The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because the black on the covers is more like a brown than black.
3,Good buy,"I read some of the reviews before I purchased this costume. As I found out, the sizes run really small. I bought a large, and I normally wear a size 4. The fabric is really stretchy, but kind of cheap. The dress is short, even for the ""large"" size. For the price, I'm completely satisfied."
2,Decent Halloween costume with a lot of problems,"This is a really short dress. It covers everything while you are standing, but once you start moving around, it rides up very quickly making shorts or other coverage very necessary.Around the collar, there is extra fabric that doesn't fold in very easily but it isn't too hard to control.The worst part about this costume however is that the black fabric rubs off on everything it comes into contact with: skin, clothes, etc. and it is very hard to get off.Also, the hat is a really awkward shape that doesn't look very cute."
5,The best music consumes you,"'Remain in Light' is Talking Heads best album. Some music one 'likes' or 'falls in love' with - not this CD. I am always looking for something that generates stronger more complex emotions. For reasons I cannot explain this particular album consumes me every time I listen to it - this is rare thing and what it should be all about. Ever since I bought a copy in 1981 I have always found something different every time I listen to it. It was clearly ahead of its time, and in my opinion one of the most powerful and innnovative albums of the 80's and 90's. Remarkable."
3,"Some timeless classics, but some boredom....","Whilst the first half of this album contains the CLASSIC Once In A Lifetime and excellent The Great Curve, Crosseyed And Painless and Born Under Punches (The Heat Goes On), the second half of this album is rather a snooze fest, with slow, moody songs with sparse instrumentation.The first four songs are worth this purchase, though be warned about the last four. I particularly recommend the 2006 CD/DVD remaster, the two videos live from German TV show RockPop are great, but the 5.1 remix doesn't do much for me.Overall, weak compared to their superior previous album, 1979's Fear Of Music. Get that before getting this one."
2,Not that funny,"Got the DVD after being teased with a few Will Ferrell/John C Reilly clips, and I was disappointed. Like another reviewer said, there are some gems, like Drunk History and some lines in Space Baby (just the fact that Fred Willard did a scene with a baby is value), but for the most part FoD is just inane. (The second star is for these bits.) The gag in the ""Snakes"" bit and ""Sleeping with Celebrities""--where one shot goes on and on for too long--was mastered by Seth McFarlane in Family Guy and FoD just took it and made it painful. I made it through 1 1/2 episodes before I asked myself why am I wasting my time watching this when I could be doing something productive like clipping my toenails or vacuuming my hallway. Maybe it got better later in the DVD but I didn't have the patience. Spend your time more wisely and watch those Family Guy or South Park reruns for the seventh time; you'll get more laughs."
1,FYI,"I don't understand the last reveiw, because it clearly states in product details that this notebook weighs under 2 pounds."
1,Somewhat Lame DVD,"I bought this for my son who wants to learn how to dance, but decided against giving it to him becuase I don't want him to learn this style of dancing. If you have never danced before I guess you can get something out of the DVD lessons. A couple of warnings: first, the instructor is teaching an ""On 1"" style, not ""On 2"" (NYC style salsa dancing). This is a major style difference. Most annoying is the slow pace of the DVD -- largely becuase this guys talks too much! At the end of disc 1 all you have learned is a very basic turn that he calls a ""salsa pattern"". There are much better products on the market -- beware of the stuff from the west coast -- it seems a little too basic for a beginner (sounds strange doesn't it?), and definitely too basic for someone who wants to improve."
4,suitable for a beginner,"The video on this DVD is skilfully done. Care has gone into not assuming any expertise on the part of the viewer. Thus, the explanations are clear and the interaction of these with the relevant video segments makes for an intuitive understanding.Another reviewer complained about the lack of enough contrast between the dancers and the background, on her TV. But I had no problem on the set I used, and perhaps that will be your experience too."
1,"HORRIBLE DANCE DVD, DO NOT BUY!!!!","Very unprofessional instructional DVD by a pair of very untalented people trying to unethically make money on a dance DVD. The couple in the video are obviously not dance professionals and are simply looking to rip people off by making a poor video with a beautiful cover picture. They didn't use their own pictures on the cover because they are two untalented people who are not professional dancers. Just a pair of business people who found a way to rip off consumers with good advertising and poor production. I wanted to return the video the moment I saw it but unfortunately, amazon doesn't allow returns on opened DVDs. It is now obvious to me why there is no trailer for the DVD. If I had seen a trailer I would have known how horrible the filming and instructional quality of the film was. Please save your money."
2,Stylistically nice but...,"I don't know if us westerners are just used to air-tight cop shows or what, but this movie is just full of holes both in terms of plot logic and -basic- police proceedure.If one didn't know better, one'd think that the Soeul PD are the biggest buncha dummies in the world.Again, nice style to the flick, great music, and even a compelling story line, but you keep on tearing out your hair at seeing the police screw even the most basic stuff out."
4,"More like ""Basic Instinct"" than ""Se7en""","First, let me say that I enjoyed this movie a lot. Understood it? Well, now, I wouldn't presume to go that far. However, I would like to clear up that this movie was NOT like ""Se7en"" for me. ""Se7en"" was about a man with a plan to show people how the Seven Deadly Sins could truly be deadly, PLUS it oh so nicely wraps up the plot with the completion of the seventh sin (those of you who saw it should know what I mean).But this movie, so I have read is more about ""a quilt"" (if you would allow me the metaphor), an ""artsy"" quilt as well as transgendered children (or something) and revenge?So yes, it has its nice gory scenes... I really enjoyed the cop in the elevator scene (I have dreams like that ;) However, still not ""Se7en"", not worse just different."
5,A useful glove-compartment reference for desert travelers,"This is a great guide to the abandoned mining towns littering the outback of Nevada andCalifornia. There's more towns dead than alive out there! Modern cities and highways are shownin black ink, and the ghost towns and historic places in red, complete with anecdotesdocumenting their significance and the years they existed. Useful in combination with Delorme'sNevada and California atlases (which you might need to actually find these towns, given the small scale of the ghost town maps)."
1,affect or content?,"As I read through this book I had the growing impression that the author was more concerned with his role as poet than he was in his poems. Too often we're given a ""mood"" line or gesture and not something that grows out of the poem itself, but the mood wears thin and so does the role."
1,"Treats from China??? Not for my gals, thanks.","My gals love them, of course, but then they'd eat lead paint chips if you covered them with something tasty.....Sorry, I just don't trust that China's standards are safe. If they let bad milk/food for babies slide through why would they give a hoot about dog/cat treats? Country of origin should be stated on the ad blurb. I would never have bought these and am sending them back."
2,The final Fall of the Third Republic,"The collapse of France in 1940 was the last in the chain of political and military defeats. First it was lost ""the battle of Czechoslovakia"" (politicaly) and then the campaign in Poland. Unfortunately, the author don't give a fair evaluation of this events. On the contrary. He quoted Marshall Petain (and agree with him), who after the disaster in 1940 maintained that one of the reasons of the collapse were ""too few allies"". Sorry, but the reality was completely ""the other way round"". It were French, who let down first Czechoslovakia in Munich and then, one year later, Poland."
4,Married for a month,I always enjoy books by Susan Mallery.When I can no longer find them in the bookstore I send to Amazon. The book was in decent condition and I have passed it on to a friend.
4,Frommer's Italy 2000,"This is a great comprehensive guide. Great maps, lists of attractions and photographs. My only concern is that some lesser known eateries and hotels are not listed."
1,Gilad's Split Routine 2,"It's from 1990. Exercise has changed in the past decade and a half. And, there was no way to tell from the box. Not worthy of Gilad or Amazon!"
2,good not verey good,not very bad or good... good looking but verey big diameter so large and soft not as originals.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!,This DVD was a great disappointment! It was nothing more than a slide show of random karagiozi images with unrelated music playing in the background. I was under the impression that I was purchasing a series of different Karagiozi skits...not so at all :-( It was definitely not worth the $30.00. It is not even worth $5.
5,Fascinating viewing,"This dvd is well worth watching. The subject matter is dealt with in a nice, down to earth way. The children are real children, with real children's lives. Just that they also happen to have various kinds of psychic abilities. My family and I found these stories fascinating."
1,Outdoor temp. stopped working,"I bought this for my husband's birthday, 12/31. He started using it then and only 1 month later, the outdoor temp. feature does not work. The sensor still displays the outdoor temperature, but it doesn't transmit it to the main display. We will be sending this back but I don't have much hope. Too bad as it is an extremely handy device."
5,"Rugged, Tough, Great Lens Case","This case is everything I have come to expect from Lowepro. High quality, very padded, and holds my lens including the lens hood. This is not a small case. I don't mind the diameter being large to accommodate the lens with it's hood. I frequently leave my large camera backpack in the trunk of my car when I go hiking to shoot pictures. I carry a second lens in the lens case and wear it over my shoulder with the shoulder strap that comes on the lens case. While on the trail I can switch lenses. Should I slip or lose my balance, I never worry that the lens in its protective case will get damaged."
5,Live and die by the sword,"This is a solid Twilight Zone episode because it sticks to a central theme it captures one's imagination entirely. It's called The Mirror because it uses a mirror in the dictator's office as a viewing device to see potential assassins. While I didn't care for the mirror as a prop, I liked this episode a lot.This is not one of the more famous episodes. It stars Peter Falk as the bearded new dictator. He was ruthless in his actions when he led the movement to overthrow the last dictator. Once in power, he discovers a potential downside of dictatorship, namely that you may have to worry about confidantes betraying you."
3,Famous actors and good directing. Half-baked plot,"This episode had a lot more characters than most. Individually, the actors were good. Everything was good except the plot. We're supposed to feel the fear and tension as Lee Marvin approaches the grave of outlaw. Note that the outlaw was not represented in a way that seemed special.I was disappointed not just because there was a let-down at the end, but also because there was never a let-up. The episode is flat due to lack of story."
5,good old days,I bought this for my 38 year old daughter and she loves them. She is a big fan of old movies and tv shows and absolutely loves Betty White so this is definitely for her. Glad I bought it for her.
5,Look no further for dutch processed cocoa,"Callebaut is superb dutch processed cocoa for both baking and ice cream. The taste surpasses other cocoa powder I've tried before. If you want a great tasting dessert that uses dutch processed cocoa, use this cocoa powder. It is not much more expensive that the store bought variety when you break down the cost per pound."
1,Waist,"According with the description this is video cable but when you connected to transfer video you can only get black and white picture, I'm really des appoint . Don't waist you money"
2,not what picture shows,"The description for this item was vague, so based on the picture depicting a thick monster style cable, i bought it. It is nothing more than a cheap thin cable and a waste of my money."
5,"1,2,3, Fish!","Very seldom will you find ""how to"" books with this much REAL information. The kind of info that even casual fishermen will find not only do-able but successful. I highly recommend it for the beginner and experienced Striper-getter. MC"
3,"good slide, good arrangements, bad vocals","Very warm, friendly, personable music. It's too bad that Cooder had to ruin it by trying to sing. He seems to think that mumbling out of the side of his mouth constitutes soulfulness. Good album if you like, relaxed, folky, shambolic music."
2,Disappointed,"I was told this would be the book where Feynman laid the foundations for quantum computing. In actuality, most of it is a rather haphazard tour of selected topics from basic computer science, using the old-fashioned bottom-up approach (starting with gates and flip-flops). There are your basic bits about Turing machines and information theory, and some weird stuff about reversible logic which supposedly leads on to the quantum computing. Then there is a reprint of an article about quantum computing which rehashes the latter bits and goes a bit farther, but unfortunately my training in quantum physics did not allow me to follow it. If you want to read good Feynman, try things like Q.E.D., which is brilliant."
2,Inconsistent quality and hard to unwrap,"I'm a fan of most ginger candy. Apart from being somewhat bothersome to unwrap, this brand suffers from inconsistent quality. I've found that in two separate bags purchased about half the candy was tender and chewy while every other candy was more less tender and had more of a chunky texture that broke into pieces while chewing."
5,Crazy Horse takes a stab at immortality,"A classic album throughout.I'd go into the background , but it has been covered quite thoroghly in the previous reviews. It starts with ""Gone Dead Train"",a balls-out rocker that grabs from the get go. George Thorogood redid this song years later and did the Horse proud.Another rocker ""Dirty , Dirty"" and ""Downtown"" show that this band can kick. Sounds a little like The Grease Band. And then , out of left field , comes ""I Don't Want To Talk About It"" , one of the most achingly beautiful heartbreak songs I've ever heard. Aside from the aforementioned Rod Stewart remake , the Indigo Girls also cut a credible version. Ry Cooder shines throughout. Nils weighs in with ""Beggars Day"" and ""Dance,Dance,Dance"" is a reworked ""Love Is A Rose"" or perhaps an earlier incarnation. Simply marvelous throughout , this is the reason Neil has stuck with this band through thick and thin. This is the American Gothic of rock 'n' roll. Simple , heartfelt and genuine."
3,"Read one, and you've read them all","I love the Zone Diet as it's relatively easy to master after initially practicing it, and it's based on good nutrition and common sense. Dr. Barry Sears is an excellent writer, making complex nutritional and physiological data very easy to understand. However, after reading 3 of his books, I find that they're all essentially the same info. His best book in my opinion: Toxic Fat as it explains the underlying metabolic issues that go on in the body when we eat/digest/process and/or store fat. His other books are just refreshers of the basic principles - with a few more recipes. After reading Toxic Fat, I'll pass on the dinner rolls, thank you."
3,Preferred 'enter the zone' more,"I much preferred reading Enter the Zone. Mastering the Zone was okay. Contained much of the same information that I had already read in Dr. Sear's previous book. If you've read Enter the Zone, I wouldn't bother reading this one."
5,Beautiful,These earrings are so beautiful and I get so many compliments on them. I received an Amazon gift card for Christmas and this was one of the gifts I chose. Delivery was quick and the packaging was excellent.
2,Blue topaz stones were a lot lighter color than shown,I was disappointed in the color of the stones. I also couldn't figure out how to open the leverback (it didn't seem to have a hinge and I was afraid of breaking it if I forced it open). I returned the earrings and was very pleased at the speed at which I got a refund.
5,silver blue topaz earrings,I received the earrings very quickly and they looked beautiful. The earrings' filigree frame looks different than the picture but they are still very pretty and a great value.
2,Poor quality Crystal,"We bought 2 of these for our formal dining room. They arrived in 1 piece from 2 different locations. The first one I checked was good quality, until I looked at its base. At the bottom it has a crack (defect) which can bee seen trough the base (it is crystal after all). It doesn't look good plus it will most likely scratch my table if I put it on the wood. The second one had a different problem. That one has stripes / cloudiness throughout the ""crystal"". So out of 2 items purchased 2 are of poor quality and defective. Not a good purchase!If the quality issues could be addressed this would be a really nice product."
4,Suprisingly enjoyable,This was just an addition to my Disney DVD collection for the sake they were putting it in the vault. I didnt think I would like it because I didnt like the second Cinderella but I actually enjoyed the story line some-what!
5,Cinderella III Review,I was pleased with the response. I received my movie within the time I requested
2,a dud,"we're a family of Disney fans around here, and we all hated it. Even my two year old, who likes anything Disney, screams ""no"" when I hold up the Cinderella III box. Stick with Cinderella I."
5,Great Movie!!,"I was expecting this to be terrible but I was so wrong! For something that was straight to DVD, I'm impressed by the quality of the animation. The storyline is solid and, as far as a backstory is concerned, you only need to see the first one to understand what's going on. I highly recommend this."
2,"Disney continues the 50s' classic, agian.","Yes. I've seen this film before it came out in stores! Ha! My grandmother got a pirated copy of this DVD at a store that sells pirates of DVDs that were originally resealed to the public later in commercial stores. (ex. Toys 'R Us) It was okay...Good: The moral of true love - even the few know...Bad: Predicable and simple.Ugly: Animation from Disney Toon Studios Australia used a few years ago is what is called NEW!And the worst of all... WHERE THE HECK IS THE FEMALE MOUSE!?DVD includes horrible Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Chosse Set-top game, Music Video and a sneak peek at ""Twice Charmed"". Well, it can be a waste of money or not. Buy this for your 5-year-old girl."
4,Great Movie!!,"When I first heard about Cinderella 3,I was really excited and couldn't wait to see it.The title was pretty catchy.The first week when I found out, I coudn't talk or think about anything else.I'd watch the previews over and over,and soon,I'd know it by heart.My aunt just bought it for us last night.I thought it was really funny.When I watched it, I was laughing so hard I had tears in my eyes.Gus and Jack were really funny to.Don't miss this film!!!!"
1,this DS browser sucks!,"First off, i couldnt even use it at first. The person who I bought it from didnt bother to include the password to access the games browser. With some searches on youtube I was able to find out how to reset it. This didnt help much because I still couldnt use the stupid thing. IT keeps saying ""unable to connect to network"". I still havent been able to use it. Im getting rid of it!"
2,Great implementation. DS falls short.,"The software is stupendous, and would earn 5 stars on its own. Unfortunately for today's internet the DS just doesn't have the power you need. No flash is liveable, but the render times are crippling.If all you want to do is read the news and check your email this may be worth it. I switched my nytimes subscription to weekends only, and just read the weekday news on the ds now. Unfortunately that's about the limit of this device's usefulness. It's simply not practical for regular web surfing or reading link-ridden blogs."
4,Great Browser for ds,"I bought this Game from amazon. it came super fast. it is a great Browser for the ds lite. this Game allows you to surf the internet using your wifi connection. you can go on facebook Ebuddy Google and anysite you can think of. the only downside to this is that the loading time takes forever. Ebuddy is the only one that runs fast. But if you have time on you hands and want to wait for the loading this is the game for you. I Love this game. I hope this Helped. Take note. you need the Ds Exspansion pack, without it it won't work."
4,Great little browser,"This browser works well on the Nintendo DS lite. Like other reviews have said, it can be a little slow, but there are some web sites, including: Amazon, USA Today, MSN, Yahoo, and Google, just to name a few that offer optimized smaller versions of their web sites that load quicker and easier for small screens like the DS and PDAs. Using the stylus is neat for clicking on links, and the touch screen keyboard that pops up for use when you need to enter information works well too. I think the added funtionality and portability that comes with the DS makes this a great product."
2,Cute but limited,"If this was a freebie added on to the DS it would been a fine and handy tool when needed.Looking up a phone number or address or to check out ""The Drudge Report"" is okay, but you cant really do a lot with it, it takes forever (90 seconds is forever in cyberspace) to load pages. It doesn't support Flash so a lot of content is unviewable. I have Verizon FIOS at home and it took me almost a week to find out the proper settings for my WEP key. Nitendo wanted me to try to slow my home system down to try and get it to work at first. I hung up on him. Also this is only for the DS LITE. if you have an older DS (DS HEAVY?) you can only get it direct from Nitendo. When it does finally load a page, it is clear and the pictures are fine."
5,Very good lens case - comparison w/ Tamrac,"I bought this one for a friend, as I already have a Tamrac equivalent. I could compare them side by side. They are essentially equivalent: same size, same thickness, same way to attach to a belt and I like them both."
1,SUCKS,"Rosemary's Baby was fun; this sequel sucks. Idiotic concept and threaded with all sorts of never-answered plot developments. Murders are left unsolved and never rate another mention after they've happened. The notion of the whole world falling so much in love with a religious figure they're willing to do what Levin would have us believe they are is out and out laughable. And to end this novel as he did, not only knocking this one out of the sky, but Rosemary's Baby as well? Mr. Levin is a rude man. Don't buy this book and don't read it. And if anyone ever figured out his word puzzle, I've yet to hear about it."
1,Absolutely lame,Don't read this book if you liked the original. The ending of this book ruins both. The characters are so one-dimensional it's agony trying to read this in its entirety. I'm just glad that i am a speed reader so i didn't waste too much time on this drivel.
2,waste of money,Starts with promise but spirals downhill quickly. Unbelievable characters and an ending that made my eyes roll.
2,Son of Ira,"This book should never have been written-shame on Ira Levin. Was he senile when he wrote it or just hard up for money? I kept on reading, hoping for the same tension that kept me on the edge of my seat when I read the original. I was sadly disappointed. And when the climax finally came(Joe nobody is Satan?-why?)it seemed lame. Adrian(Andrew) is nailed to the wall? Talk about your cliches. And I found the whole ""Strawberry fields"" thing preposterous(poor John Lennon). Then the ending, when it was all a dream, and the Bram is now the Dakota, which was black, which is now pink? Huh? Musings of a senile old man, if you ask me. So, it never happened? This kind of reminds me of the way they ended ""St. Elsewhere"" as a dream in an autistic child's snowglobe. Another WTF moment. Please, send this awful story back to whence it came-the depths of hell!"
1,Don't Read It.,"After reading and loving ""Rosemary's Baby,"" I was thrilled when I was walking through a bookstore one day and saw that Ira Levin had written a sequal. I had a brief moment of hesitation before bringing it to the cash register. Sequels, I told myself, are never quite as good as the original. Would this one be the exception? NO!!! This book is stupid and horribly written, very much unlike Levin's usually wonderful writing style. It was so bad in fact that it almost ruined my ideas of the first book. I couldn't finish it. Don't read this book!!!"
2,Sometimes sequels are better left unsaid.,"The author tries......but just doesn't cut it. First of all, Rosemary awakens from a 27 year coma to find her son a world famous ""leader"" of sorts, and when she confronts him with his past, he gives her a two second explanation of how he has totally ignored his Satanic upbringing and is now working for the good of mankind and she readily accepts this. It gets worse from there. As the reader is swept along in an entirely unreal environment, the atmosphere becomes more and more predictable. Though Ira Levin offered a nice twist at the end, it flopped miserably and reminded me very much of the Wizard of Oz. The characters in the story don't even behave as humans would given their circumstances, and often the dialogue is disjointed and thoughts come out of nowhere. My best advice - if you must read this book, borrow it, don't waste your money."
2,Mediocre,"I have to agree with the reviewers who were disappointed in this book. I have to admit that I discounted their reviews and took the book out of the library anyway-it was free, and I enjoyed ""Rosemary's Baby"" so much I figured I had nothing to lose. And I didn't; I mean it was somewhat amusing, but nowhere near as much so as the first one. Ira Levin is very talented at producing good page-turners but this book could have been a lot more interesting.Rosemary's Baby had a kind of dry, dark humor and was quite riveting-I have no idea where he was planning on going with this book though. I kind of liked the idea that maybe Rosemary had some free will to begin with and was exploring the consequences of her life choices in this book and ultimately perhaps had a chance at redemption, but Levin was so cryptic and this book so ambiguous that it is hard to know what to read into it. Mysteries are fun; complete confusion isn't."
1,horrifying book,"It's not just that Ira Levin seemed sloppy and lazy in writing this book. It's worse than that - he seemed to write the story with contempt for the subject. I was horrified as I read it, not because of the ""horror"" of the subject matter or plot line, but because I couldn't believe how much contempt was pouring out of the author of the original classic. It's as though he was laughing at everyone who enjoyed the original story and was saying, ""you want a sequel - how about THIS, sucka!""Don't buy, don't borrow, don't bother. I've never read anything worse."
1,A waste of time!!!,"I am not going to waste everyone's time and effort in rehashing what MOST people have said about ""Rosemary's Son."" It's a total waste. No wonder the librarians at my local library have said most people hated the book. Also, no wonder why the book is already on the used book shelves at the booksellers."
4,Take the time!,"First of all, let me say, this book is one that becomes great once you take the time to understand it. G-Cone and Sukikingfisher's reviews in particular were extremely helpful in my finding the theme, and once I did, I was awe-struck by how much I had missed out by my superficial reading.Four stars."
1,"""Lame"" effort not up to Levin's usual high standards","I have read -- and thoroughly enjoyed -- many of Levin's books, including Rosemary's Baby, This Perfect Day, and my favorite, The Boys From Brazil. Levin's plot twists, and especially his rare talent for unusual and thought-provoking endings have made each of these books real page-turners. Some sequels actually improve on their originals; Son of Rosemary is a lame effort that only reinforces the opinion that even talented authors like Levin should leave wildly successful stories uncontinued. If you are a ""Dallas"" fan and bought the ""Pam's dream"" explanation for Bobby's resurrection after the scriptwriters killed him off, you'll love this book. Otherwise, don't waste your money."
1,"Go Green, have your copy recycled.","Don't read unless your out to tarnish your opinion of Rosemary's Baby.This book is nothing more than a quick cash in on an American Classic, and don't let the ""you just have to get it"" reviews fool you because there's nothing here to get. Ira doesn't even tell you what the anagram referred to many times throughout the book (Roast Mules) even means because it's just meaningless.To sum it up... the book is basically just silly, boring rambling with a terribly weak plot that doesn't match up well with the original.Nothing mysterious about it, the ending is just silly and even insulting to the reader... it's just weak.It's like ordering a double vodka and you realize you've been served a club soda.I actually question whether Ira Levin even wrote this because it's such a drastic drop in quality from the original."
2,Too bad...,"I really enjoyed this book...until I got to the end. Without giving away the disappointing ending, suffice it to say that in one fell swoop, Ira Levin (one of my favourite authors btw) managed to totally negate both this book as well as the classic ""Rosemary's Baby"". I honestly felt like throwing the book across the room when I finished it. I'm very unhappy with this cheap ""cheat"" of an ending..."
1,Wasn't worth $1,"I bought the hardcover version of this book at a Dollar store, and realized I got ripped off. Although it was an easy read, the whole thing was unbelievable (at least the original made a great movie). I guess the author was trying to cash in on the millenium madness, as well as his former much better works. The ending was garbage, and made me realize that I would have been better off spending my time doing something useful, like taking a nap.Roast mules was at least somewhat amusing."
2,Son of Rosemary,"I did enjoy the book at first, but then it started to get a bit bizarre. Such as when Andy would come on to his mother, her reponse was puzzling, but maybe she didn't expect anything other than that type of behavior since his father was satan. I was also confused about the ending. Was everything a dream or some sort of foresight of the future of her and Guy. I also still have no idea what ""Roast Mules"" is suppose to mean."
1,"Initially promising, ultimately unsatisfying.","Having read (and loved) Ira Levin's horror classic when I was still in high school, I was thrilled to see that there was a sequel. The book started out OK (if a bit far-fetched), but in the end was very disappointing.In the essence of time, I will keep this review short and pointed. If you have read the original, you will be disappointed by the plot devices at play here. Also, those who haven't will probably find the book a bit silly. Anyway, I would only recommend this to someone who has some spare weekend moments and can't find anything on the telly -- it is essentially trash, so if you must read it, don't waste too much time on it!"
2,dissapointing,"I was hoping for more basic diagrams. The whole book only had a couple. I wanted a basic charging circuit, a basic ignition circuit etc. The examples from Pinto and VW didn't tell me what I wanted to know.Lots of filler on general electrical principals if you need that, but very weak on practical applications."
5,One of 06's Finest,"Damn. Now this is more like it. Up until now, supergroups were tarred with tarnished and gag inducing brush that Asia foisted upon the term back in the early 80's. And in their defense, Golden Smog had been content to release good music that somehow drifted underneath the radar of too many listeners. But the opening chords of ""You Make It Easy"" from Another Fine Day wipes that forever away. And the ultimately too-frickin'-catchy for it's own sake ""5-22-02"" hooks you in for the duration. Rest assured, there isn't a bad song on this disc. But for the sake of discussion, try out ""Beautiful Mind,"" ""Listen Joe,"" and ""Hurricane."" And if for some reason that defies any semblance of logic, that doesn't sell you on this album, try out ""Cure For This."" This is a song that deserves loving treatment by Matthew Sweet & Susanna Hoff on their Under the Covers"" album. What could have been an exercise of self-indulgence arrives as one of 2006's finest albums."
4,a warm little fellow,I now have 3 of these warm little fellows. They are easy to move because they don't weigh very much. They give off an amazing amount of heat for their size. I don't have any hesitation in recommending them. And they are well priced.
1,LASTED 28 DAYS,"The smell of melting plastic was our first warning something was wrong. This was our first DeLonghi product. It will be our LAST! It burned out in 28 days with only limited use. The fan won't even work. We have Pelonis ceramic heaters and Laskos that have lasted 10 to 15 years. This is exactly why I've stopped reviewing any product until it had been in use for several months. I clean all space heaters in use weekly with either a vacuum or light compressed air. It was as clean as new. I won't bother sending it back, but I will send out a warning to anyone considering buying a DeLonghi DC1030 Ceramic Heater. BUYER BEWARE!"
4,Good for what it is,"This heater is a handy performer, as long as you know why you are getting it. When you buy an inexpensive unit like this, realize that it does not come with bells and whistles (like oscillation, an automatic shut-off when the unit tips over, or precise temperature control), and that it is noisy. But if you need a quick, easy, and inexpensive way to heat up a small room this unit does it. So don't buy a $20 heater expecting the world. As a heater, this unit does a good job."
2,Too noisy,I ordered this for my office and was surprised that it's so noisy! Even my colleagues sitting near my office could hear it! Wanted to return but saw that the postage is half the price of this heater! Gave up. Not happy with the purchase.
2,DeLonghi heater,The heater works well in a small bathroom. The only problem I have with it is that it is too loud. I've seen other heaters after I purchased this one that I can barely hear. I would not use the heater in the bedroom as I would not be able to sleep.Thank you.
5,DeLonghi Heater,I love this heater it pumps out a lot of heat even on low. Great for chilly mornings so that i can warm up quickly.
4,its worth the money,"Good price for this heater, works good i got it for my bedroom at a great price, i love the quality and capacity, kept my room warm and feels great"
2,LOUD.,"Really disappointing. This heater is ridiculously loud. I could never sleep with this running. We had a ceramic heater in the past which was also inexpensive, but much quieter. For us there are two main features that are ""must haves"": 1. Heat and 2. Quiet. Completely fails on #2. If you don't care, then buy it - it just seems like all the others on the market."
1,Thermostat loses stars,"Update: With the thermostat unmoved from the setting where it had heated the room to 75 degrees, it later heated it to 97 degrees, causing adhesive-based hooks to fall off walls and possibly damaging cosmetics. I cannot recommend this heater. I see several other heaters with different names that look identical to this one. I suspect they are the same."
3,Warm but loud!,"What do you expect for $20? This heater is great at heating up your personal space (under a desk or a small room) but don't expect it to do much for a larger room (like a living room with high ceilings). Maybe I didn't give it enough time to really get going but after an hour the sound of the fan was driving me crazy. Sure, my feet were nice and toasty but the heater was loud -- too loud to just ignore as background noise.Functionality: 5 starsConstruction: 4 stars (not perfect but not shoddy)Noise level: 2 stars (not deafeningly noisy but louder than my microwave or overhead fan turned to the highest setting)"
1,NOT SAFE!!!,"I was ready to give a glowing review about this heater, as it works very well, BUT when one of my cats accidentally knocked it over, it STAYED ON. It does not shut off. In any direction it continues to run if tipped over. This is very dangerous & I'm totally surprised Delonghi can manufacture a heating unit without a safety cut off feature, let alone sell it in the U.S.Please don't buy this heater!! Wish I hadn't...."
2,"OK, but noisy","I've been searching for an additional space heater like the old style Toastmaster 1500W. This does not even come close. I thought the ceramic feature would generate more heat, but alas, it's just another mediocre heater. sigh...."
4,Loud but that's OK,I like the small compact size. The heater is definitely a little noisier than I expected but I don't really mind because I'd rather be warm. The dials are simple. I haven't had any problems with my heater.
2,Appropriate only for extreme beginners,"This DVD is appropriate only for people who are at the very beginning of an exercise program. For anyone with even a moderate level of exercise, most of the exercises require very little effort. A few of the stretching and relaxation moves were nice, but most would be just as effective without the ball. For those who practice yoga, trying to fit the ball into some moves such as ""downward facing dog"" was just plain annoying. I would recommend a DVD with a higher level of difficulty that could be achieved after some practice with the ball."
1,"When they say beginners, they mean it.","After reading other reviews I thought this would be a good fit for me. I'm not overweight, but I'm not exactly fit so I wanted something to ease me into working out again. This would be great for someone with an injury or are looking to gain some flexibility. If you're in ok shape at all it is too easy."
5,LOVE Susan Deason,"I'm a huge fan of Susan Deason. This video, for some reason, makes my friend and I giggle everytime we do it. It is an easy workout yet you feel the effects of a workout. There are some poses at the end that have even cracked my back, which is a good thing. Perfect for beginners, but also good for non-beginners that are in the mood for a more mellow workout. This video will not only give you a healthy, easy-going workout, but it will also put you in a better mood. I would recommend any of her DVDs."
2,Maybe best for the EXTREME beginner at working out.,"I purchased this DVD as I have never taken a balance ball class, wanted to be sure to learn the basics like correct form, etc., and didn't want to start out with something too advanced. I was impressed by the positive reviews for this DVD, however, I found the whole DVD to be geared more for those who were totally new to exercise, all together. I would recommend this for seniors as it would be really beneficial for that age group and those with a similar level of fitness, flexibility and energy. I purchased a couple other balance ball DVD's that I really liked, including one with Susan Deason teaching, so at least I had something to compare to before writing this. I will donate this DVD to the library so that it may be of use to someone else."
4,A Welcome Addition...,"What the author succeeds in accomplishing with ""Grail Knights"" is popularizing what many have known (or at least suspected) for some time. While this work will certainly be dismissed by as many critics as will welcome its ""revelations"" of a Templar base in Acadia and the ""Grail Religion,"" its real significance may rest elsewhere. Primarily, in shining a spotlight on the neglected history of Atlantic Canada's medieval connections. Because of this, ""Grail Knights"" is a welcome addition to the library of any Mason, Templar or student of the history of Atlantic Canada or New England."
2,Fun But...,"I love these kinds of books as much as I love all conspiracy theories, even though I have never found one that rings true. Most serious, professional academics dismiss easily this sort of thing for lack of evidence. Compare the Newport Tower and the knight's grave marker in Massachusetts (?).Still, it's fun. Maybe it's true or has some truth associated with it. There is so much new archeology being done all over the world that I HOPE it's true.Poor Mr. Bradley would like so much to be taken seriously and get the recognition he thinks he deserves. He does not have the credentials, though, and seems to have missed his opportunity to get them in the academic world.Really, I hope someone proves him right. Living in the middle of North America -- on the Great Lakes -- this is fun stuff!"
2,"Decent enough,","This has a nice collection of historical anecdotes and folk tales, but it wasn't what I expected it to be. I guess the actual ""Thirty-six Strategums"" is too small to publish? Hence why the author of this book decided to elaborate? I also wish he kept the original format of the scroll. Listing it in the preface doesn't help me categorize the strategies later.This is, however, the only book on the subject I was able to find. The wiki article outlines the strategums better: [...]."
3,Sometimes boring,"The book is well-organized, and gives some good advices on the best way to solve some common problems.Though the contents are interesting, the author's writing style is sometimes pretty boring, and I had some problems staying focused."
3,trouble setting day,"Its a great watch. Have trouble adjusting the Day and Date. The stem whwn pulled once is suppose to allow to adjust day, but it doesn't go"
3,Not so informative as I expected,"After reading the great book, I was curies to see Mr. Karp method in a real. But the film gives you only overviewed information about the method. You can hear Mr. Karp himself talking about the method and people from Mr. Karp classes talking about how the method works with their children, but you don't hear as much as you can read in the book. Except a few short moments you can't hear ""Toddler-ese"" and see real situation with cranky toddler. Some scenes and bla, bla, bla....This film is more like advertisement of the book, then information itself."
1,Don't Bother,"If you dont have any common sense then this is for you. Waste of time and money, painful to watch and couldnt sit thru the entire thing during the first viewing."
1,JUNK,I took this unit out of the box for the first time today. It won't even turn on. This unit it JUNK - I wouldn't give it the one star but was forced to enter something!
1,FALSE ADVERTISING,Turn the product upside down and read the watt rating and you will not find the advertised 800 watt. I want the extra heat because it makes a better coffee! I returned the item.
5,Great heater,"This is great to use on cold nights in the bedroom.Even when it gets really cold at night and you'd be a fool to not have the heater on, you can turn this unit to max in the bedroom for 2 hours before hitting the hay and your room will be nice and toasty.Then just turn the heat down to medium or low depending on how cold it is and you'll go to sleep and wake up warm.I'm seriously considering canceling my gas line next year if this does the trick on the coldest nights this year.So far, so good."
3,Nice heat but has an odor.,"I tried really, really hard to like this heater. It does put out a lovely and very efficient heat, but it also puts out a terrible chemical odor. The instructions say that odor takes time to burn off, but i've been using this for a while and it still reeks. It also makes me (and the dogs) sneeze, and gives me a headache if i leave it on too long. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone who has allergies or chemical sensitivities. I think the issue is that the heat radiates out from the core THRU the plastic, so the plastic is outgassing volatile chemicals due to the heat.I'm going to keep this for emergencies in the event my heat pump fails in cold weather, but i really can't tolerate the odors/headaches it gives me on a daily basis.It was otherwise a nice product and a nice design, but i think the plastic outgassing may be trouble for some people who have sensitive noses or allergies."
5,"A good one, but get if outside of Am..on","Very good heater, I got two of those, the only drawback is that one of them is noisy - makes the click click sound when stops heating. Otherwise - perfect. It helped to reduce drastically the exorbitant gas bills I was getting this winter.No leaks, no smells. It works in enclosed spaces, don't expect miracles in open spaces.Get with confidence, the real price should be around $50, but beware that A.....n manipulates with the price - they raised it from $50-ties to $80ties last winter."
3,Thermostat useless; should not have reduced size three inches,The prior model was a bit larger and more effective with practically the same compact size. The thermostat is unreliable.
2,"Okay heater, but doesn't last","I own the Delonghi oil-filled radiator model number TRN0812T. It gives added heat to a room, but it doesn't last very long at all. We've had it for about three years and only used in maybe 20 or 30 times and it doesn't even turn on anymore. It's sitting in my cellar in my junk pile after only 20-30 uses."
3,Nice heater but to noisy for a bedroom,"This is a nice looking heater with good safety features but the CLICKING noise is so loud that it continues to wake me and my wife up every night! I don't know if it the timer or heat expansion. Five or so loud clicks in a series whenever it turns on. I'm sending it back (if postage isn't too expensive). Otherwise, it is only useful for a garage. I sure wish there was a less expensive way to return goods (especially heavy items) to Amazon."
2,Good Luck,"Purchased this over a month ago, had it 3 days and it stopped working. Now I am still waiting on DeLonghi to send me a replacement.......NOT good customer service"
4,Great Unit,"This is a great little heater. The timer feature allows me to set it to go on just before I wake up, turn off when I leave for work, and turn back on just before bedtime. It is much lower profile than the other DeLonghi's that I've seen/used. It really hides out of sight in my bedroom and heats the room nicely.My only complaint is that the power cord (not pictured) comes out the front at the bottom. It is therefore visible assuming you keep the controls facing front. I would have liked to have seen it come out the back or at least behind the front feet."
1,owner,I had the product for a couple days when it ceased to work. I am in the process of replacing it in hopes that I have better luck. The machine itself put out a lot of heat when it worked. 2nd one stopped working after 1 hour.....
4,Little heater,Great LITTLE heater - quiet and belts out heat but is smaller than it looks on the website. Not sure how much electricity it uses either. Good buy if you want to keep the chill out of a room not so good if it is the only heat source.
3,Smells when 1500w is used,"This is a quiet item. Not ideal for a big room but quite strong for its size. It has three level of power output and when 1500w is turned on, the smell is really bad."
2,OK While It Worked,"I have now bought 3 of these units and none have lasted over 2 years. I will buy no more, I have owned several DeLonghi heaters and they have all been excellent but this model is junk. If you want a really good oil heaters buyDelonghi TRD0715T Safe Heat Oil-Filled RadiatorI have had one for 5 years and the latest reviews suggest the same quality is still there."
3,Product OK But Not Fond of Lexmark,"Pricing from Amazon was good and I regard Amazon as a good seller. But overall the pricing from Lexmark is outrageously high. This product will be used in a 500C color laser by Lexmark. When the printer was new, they shipped it with a set of so-called ""starter"" cartridges that make only a few copies. For the proper sized replacement cartridge the prices are outrageous. The cost to replace all four colors is more than the cost of the entire printer!!!I won't buy another Lexmark product unless forced to by circumstances."
2,Not bad but very short.,"This book is only 50 pages and it was written years ago. It's not a very helpful guide. I have been living and teaching in Korea for the past 4 years, so I know what I'm talking about. Just do a web search for Korea blogs or Korea teaching memoir and get all the information you need."
2,Outdated,"This book is so outdated now! It's poorly written, but I learned at least the basics. I still cannot write a servlet if I had to, but I did learn what a servlet is. I'd buy another Java Web Server book before this one."
2,"Not Too Bad, If You Can Stand It","This is not a bad book -- it contains some useful information concerning JWS and servlets.However, the book was written by 2 college students, and it shows. The writing is juvenile, with way too much injection of the author's personalities into the book. A ""brat"" example, discussions of ""cool"" websites vs. uncool ones, figures with captions like ""Gads! I can't connect!"" and ""Yup! It's plain text, all right!"", sections of the book with titles like ""Java Web Server, We Have a Problem"" are a few examples.If you can stomach writing like this ...""Uh oh! Why did we get a NullPointerException, especially in code we didn't write? (We inherited the code for getServletContext from GenericServlet!)""... then you might be able to get something out of the book. As for me, an hour of reading was all I could stand.A note to the authors: Please remove the exclamation point from your keyboards."
3,Full Pursuit,"Unit One, the highly classified group of operatives who defend the US from things the more public agencies can't combat, may have finally asked too much of Melody Beecham. Her latest assignment involves going undercover at a religious cult and seducing a man she does not know. Moreover, she is involved with Nikolai Anwar, and his assignment involves seducing a powerful senator's wife whose daughter belongs to the same cult Melody has infiltrated. While Nik is quite matter of fact about the necessities, Melody can't believe they are expected to do this. Nonetheless, they go their separate ways into the tinderbox of race, religion, and fanaticism.*** Tension runs at warp speed from beginning to end. This is a book that may well be a cross over novel, bringing in readers who are more suspense fans than romance fans. ***"
5,A book I couldn't put down,This book is a testament to the strength of the human spirit. A fascinating story that should be required reading for high schools. Not only is it a history lesson but an example of how strong a child's spirit can be.
2,Poor quality not in line with price.,"The materials are OK, the glass top looks great.The welds on the product were done with all the care and precision of your average junior high metal shop student.The screws are of such low quality that a very small person can strip the heads using only a hand held screw driver. (NOT power tools)Cheap quality plastic drawer fronts and very weak drawer bottoms. Only time will tell if they will hold up."
2,Product defective.,The product was defective when it arrived. The black paint on the face of the cabinet had been seared off on one of the corners. I am still waiting for a replacement after 3 weeks.
4,"For the price, you cant go wrong.","This airsoft gun is a good enty level gun.For the price this is pretty much a steal.I have the older WELL R6 M4 but i believe there are little differences.Pros:PriceVery good entry level gunAdjustable hop-upHigh cap magazineGood FPS with .20g bb's (i would NOT recommend using .12g bb's)Decent battery and charger included.Able to use a scope after removing carrying handleCons:Plastic Construction (except for the rail)Not very upgradeableMis-fires a lot on full autoLight weightOverall if your looking for a decent airsoft gun at a good price, go for this gun.Otherwise go for an Echo 1, Classic Army or G&G; airsoft gun as those are much higher quality, but much pricer.For someone looking to get into airsoft this is basically the perfect gun. Experienced airsoft playersshould go for the higher end AEGs."
2,?,I ordered this gun about 2 weeks ago and it still hasnt got here yet. Did i do something wrong or just order from the wrong company?????The gun does look alright and from the other reviews it seems that it performs well but the customer service is very bad. Order from airsplat or something else instead.
2,Bad,"This gun is bad, it is advertised as a metal gearbox, but when i got it, it was mostly plastic.Second, after 3 hours of use, it broke. Not recommended."
2,Well M4 AEG,"I thought I was getting a good deal on a gun for $60.00 (on sale) nope. The gun broke after light usage in two months. I called AirSplat who were very nice. Untill they told me I had to ""make the gun perform how I want it to by adjusting it."" It missfired, and showed sign of extreme decrease in FPS. I know that after ""tuning"" my gun and it doesn't work, that means its broken. I called Amazon and I'm getting a refund. I'm buying a better gun, I don't want to deal with the problems of this gun again. The reason I gave it two stars is that while it worked, it was great."
2,Unhappy,"The gun worked for 20 seconds before it stopped working, but even worse is dealing with Airsplat on trying to get a function gun back to me. Its been 6 weeks and two returns and still nothing.The gun may be an ok product, but I would not know because to the utter disregard for the customer that Airsplat displays. Terrible."
3,CD Stanley Black Intimate Percussion/Exotic Percussion,Disappointing as it does not have the same quality as thePercussion Records by Enoch Light. Music still enjoyable.
4,good album for a great band,"Dreams of Death- a concept album, if I got this right, this is about a man who realizes is a killer and then separates dreams from reality and drowns in sorrow. Eric sings great as usual and the lyrics are very smart. The band is tight and clean. I love the fact that the n. of songs is limited (a recent trend in metal) rather than including filler. A nice little CD that is currently on hot rotation on my Linn system in good company with the children of bodom, the great opeth, gamma ray and the new halloween!"
5,Explores Jesus Christ's life and impact on humanity,"The collaboration of Richard A. Burridge (Den of King's College, London, England) and Graham Gould (former Lecturer in Theology and Religious Studies, King's College, London, England), Jesus Now And Then explores Jesus Christ's life and impact on humanity. Beginning with the New Testament, Jesus Now And Then examines early church debates, manners in which Jesus has been portrayed throughout history, the context of current questions and controversies about Jesus, and much more. A seminal account as accessible to lay people as it is to serious students and theologians, Jesus Now And Then strives to truly understand what history and religion alike have to tell us about Jesus. A superbly researched account that also traces perception and understanding of Jesus' legacy up to the modern day."
2,SMELLY,The smell is awful. Don't get it unless you want your kitchen to smell like a retirement home. I've tried washing it several times with no luck. :(
3,Could have been perfect!,"I've owned this colander for several years. But that doesn't mean it's held up well. I wouldn't know because I barely use it. That stupid lip around the top gets filled with food/liquid gunk and is impossible to clean. This would be a fantastic product, if not for this fatal flaw.I like everything else about it. I just only use it in extreme emergencies when I need a colander stat and everything else is dirty. So basically, it gets used on Thanksgiving and Christmas. If that.I'd look for another colander if you are getting ready to buy this. Make sure you read the reviews to see if it has a disgusting, food-catching inner lip!"
2,Not what I thought,"This item is convenient to work with, but difficult to clean. Also it's larger than I imagined. I wouldn't recommend it unless you have a large sink."
3,Not quite what I expected,"I was hoping for a strainer that would work for washing rice. It does alright, but as stated before, it is pretty flimsy. The holes are also bigger than I'd hoped; the long grain white rice we use gets stuck in the strainer. It's also somewhat a pain to wash by hand; we accidentally got some cheddar cheese stuck in it, and it took five minutes to get out. However, it does do the job, and the over-the-sink option is great. We washed cherries in it, and it was perfect for that, as it would be for other larger items. I'll definitely continue to use it, but it wasn't everything I had hoped for."
1,Lip Sucks,There is a lip along the top that catches all of the food. This thing is a total pain in the rear to clean. Food gets behind the metal lip and there is no way to get it out.
2,Fatal flaw--bad smell!,"The idea is great--a strainer big enough to hold whatever you're preparing, with extending arms that let you suspend it over even large kitchen sinks. But here's the problem: the rubber grips on the arms are made out of some lousy kind of fake rubber that really stinks--like a sharp, chemical, almost burning-tire kind of smell. I bought mine last year and left it to sit in the garage, hoping the smell would eventually go away, but it still hasn't. Definitely not something you want in your kitchen!"
3,Just wish it were larger.....,"This contraption is fine, works ok, as intended, a bit awkward to store and use -- the ""legs"" don't slide very easily. I just wish it were larger. I got it to replace a plastic colander/strainer that was large enough to cover most of one side of my sink. The only problem with it was that the holes in the bottom did not readily release the water because there was too much solid surface between them. I knew a wire-mesh surface would work better, and it does, but this basket covers only half of my sink space. Why on earth doesn't someone make a strainer that covers the whole space? A head of Romaine lettuce barely fits in this basket. We need an over-sink strainer that would hold a head of Romaine, PLUS a couple of bell peppers, a big stalk of broccoli, and an entire bunch of celery."
3,Got this for brewing,But it was too small to handle the grain bags. My wife uses it to clean vegetables in the sink.
2,Exhaustive/Exhausting,"Mr. Holt has obviously devoted a great deal of time and effort into this opus. He consistently apologizes for trying the reader's patience with Iliad-like detail. I appreciate the apology, but this book, while an exhaustive study is still exhausting to read. It is written fluently, but reads more like a history textbook than an in-depth study. At times his story is downright compelling, but the minutiae of exactly which elector voted on exactly which issue becomes demoralizing to the reader as he doubts he will ever come to the end of the book. Mr. Holt begins in his preface to point out that he originally wanted to focus on the election of 1844. That section of the book is truly well-written. Similarly, there are other sections of the book when Mr. Holt does warm to his subject, but the rest of it is rather boring and scattered. Although he admits he worked on this study for 22 years, I'm sure if he had more time he could have made it much shorter."
2,Wait for the Abridgement,"This book is certainly the most definitive work on the Whig Party that one could imagine being written. And I, being a history major and political history buff, thought it would be a great read. But I could not make it more than about a quarter of the way through this book. There is just way too much information in this book. It is very, very well researched and documented, but it is not a good book for the armchair historian. If you are researching the Whig Party for a scholarly work, this is a great starting point. If you are an average history buff, this is not your book."
5,Practical Illustrations,"This small book is filled with great examples of effective logo designs. It provides the novice as well as the experienced designer a library of useful logo designs and the reason that they are so effective. Antonelli draws upon his great love of the craft to share his approach to design and how to give simplicity that extra punch.While many design books are heavy on theory with little practical application, this one can be used daily in the studio or shop as an aide to better layout and design."
2,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR! GO FLOURESCENT!!,AS I STATED ABOVE!! JUST SPLURGE AND GET THE FLUORESCENT LIGHT!I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WAS THINKING...OH WAIT...YEAH I DO...GO CHEAP!!!
5,"Anita has a beautiful voice, reminiscent of Wynona Judd.","This is a beautiful song that wraps up the feelings of two friends who want their relationship to go further. A very romantic song.Anita has a beautiful voice, reminiscent of Wynona Judd."
2,Save your money,"This book was a total waste of money for me. The UK English is nearly impossible to decipher at times. It is very difficult reading. This mihgt be a good book for experts but is worthless to the beginner. The author describes repair in detail, but assumes the reader knows all the technical terms being used without explaining them. The drawings are difficult to decipher. Photos would have been better. If you are a beginner looking for a good book to get started in clock repair, this isn't it!"
1,hard to understand,Very difficult book to comprehend. Just about useless as an aid to repairing clocks. I think a lot of it has to do with the language gap between American English and what the people in Britain speak. I am sorry I wasted my money on this book.
4,"this is ""the book"" for male clotheshounds.","This book is elegantly illustrated and shows the timelessness - some might say ""sameness"" - of men's fashion from the 1930s to the 1940s. This is the kind of book you don't lend to friends, because you'll never get it back. Speaking of which, does anyone have a copy to sell? I loaned mine to a friend - soon to be an ex-friend - and the book is out of print."
3,for collector's only,"Im a real Twilight Zone fan.Why?This TV-Series stands and fall with the stories.Okay,Rod Serling's Original got the best writers and season one of the new series are very well.But the stories of season 2 & 3 are not so famous...However,for a complete collector a must,for the fans of the Original,leave it."
4,This is a REAL review of this item,"The warranty is for ONE year, not 90 days as listed. The heater is very solidly made compact bathroom approved wall heater, has a timer, 2 levels of electrical output plus a fan only function, and can be set from 1-6. It does not require a 3 prong outlet and has the safety plug for automatic shut off like a hair dryer does. As with other Delongi heaters, once you have the room at the desired temperature you turn the dial until it turns off to maintain the current room temperature. The heater fan is relatively quiet and for the small grill area, I was surprised at the heat output. So why not 5 stars? Well,I thought it is a bit misleading as the towel bar does not heat up as it is ""heated"" by the forced air blowing over it. Would I buy it again? Definitely, no buyers remorse."
1,Not what the Mfg claimed,This product could not warm a dish towel and certainly not a small bathroom.The air flow could not be felt beyond one foot of the unit.
3,"Mediocre quality, nothing compared to Spade made in UK","This one is not made in England and the quality is really mediocre. It doesn't have the beautiful white undertone you would expect from a Spode and the lines are blurry. I have several Spode pieces made in England from Williams & Sonoma Home (before it closed its shops) and they are several levels superior. This is ok for causula use, but skip it if you are expecting something you want to keep for a long time."
1,Defective merchandise,"Sorry,This item was defective and would not work. Won't send back just will not order from you again!"
1,I'm going to have to use it for something else.,it didn't work for my camera and wish it did. But maybe it will work on somethings else or maybe someone else will need it.
1,still waiting for my product?,"I am still waiting for my product, that where it is, more than one month has passed,no idea about refund?thanks."
1,this cable didn't work when i recieved it,"I really needed this product but when i got it out of the package and tried it it wouldn't even work, you are supposed to use this to upload your pictures from you camera to the computer with this cable but when i recieved it it didn't work at all."
2,They Got Me,"I had to Buy this Cable to Go with my Kodak type III Camera Dock for my New Kodak Camera. Kodak doesn't tell you that this Cable will be needed in order to allow the Camera Dock to Download photos to your PC. I sent several E-Mails to Kodak concerning their choice to use a Proprietary Cable instead of a Standard USB cable, Only to get a standard response of where and what cable to buy from the Kodak Website.Basically I feel if Kodak wants to sell a Camera Dock, The Special Cable should be Included in the Box. Very disappointed with Kodak, Kudos to Amazon.The 2 Star Rating is for Amazon (a) Carrying the Cable and (b) Selling it cheaper than Kodak. Zero Stars to Kodak."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"The cable looked right and fit right but didn't work. Tried multiple USB ports on several devices, none recognized the camera. Luckily I found the original cable a few days later. Don't buy this unless you only intend to use cable as a prop."
4,Nice,Chord worked just fine. Make sure you read to see if your model is compatible. The chord fits in a little hard but transfers files and everything fine. Great price.
1,Cable is defective,"The cable will not send or receive any signals. Hooked directly to wall charger, nothing. Connected to the USB of a PC, nothing. Connected to the USB of a Mac, nothing. This cable does not transmit anything!"
1,Didn't work,"Didn't work at all. Don't buy. Waste of money. It didn't do anything when plugged in, I was not able to transfer anything."
1,Did NOT work with my Kodak M763,Read all the reviews...but the cable did NOT work with my Kodak camera. It fit fine but error message. It is NOT a kodak product even though it is titled Kodak. Now what??? not worth returning????
4,Kodak U-8 USB Cable (Purchased 08/20/2011) by Kodak,"The item was received earlier than promised.Item was well packed and arrived in good condition.Item worked right out of the box.Plugging in a cable probably does not warrant a video,It can only be inserted one way unless you use a big hammer)."
5,"Horrifying, Thrilling, Emotional and Wonderful!!","Cathy Cash Spellman has written a masterpiece that desrves applause and honoring. This book is more mature readers only, due to the books sometimes gruesome violence and occult theme. This book brings many faiths together. Her characterization is splendid, the book is so well done it is believable and riveting. This book is also helpful in how Chrisitans can fight the devil with the power of God against evil. A must read for all avid readers and people of deep spiritual convictions."
4,book damaged,"The star rating is for the story not the condition of the book.I received this book in a royal mail envelope stating it had been damaged before entering the UK. Each page of the book was soaking wet. It was not worth sending it back (shipping more expensive than the book). As I had wanted to read this book for quite some time, I dried each page with a hair dryer (this took quite a bit of time). However,even though the pages were dried and crinkled,I enjoyed the book immensly.I have ordered goods/books etc., from Amazon for years and everything has been excellant. I hope this is a one off!!."
4,Keeffy,Great Stuff but package did not contain installation manual and so the untrained individual would not be able to install. Item was offered with TV wall mount when purchased and goes well with that item.
5,This heat sink is awesome.,"In my opinion this heatsink fan system is the best air cooling you can get for a CPU. I have ran mine for 2 years now on an overclocked P4 HT, I tried other heat sink coolers and they could hold there own...when loud. This is amazinly quiet, my case fan is louder than it, my temp went from 80 C peak to 42C peak. Now the only heat problems I have are my VGA...working on that now. That is what reminded me to write this review.SO IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A SINGLE AIR COOLER for your CPU. Buy this. You wont be disapointed. Just use a diffrent thermal paste."
1,"Don't Use their ""EZ mount""","Keep getting out focus when scanning 35mm negative films? The hint is NOT using EZ film mounts that comes with this i800 scanner. The mount lifted films like 2mm from the glass, which makes it getting out of focus.How come they can ship the mounts with the scanners without testing before?"
1,Expensive Piece of Junk,"This is one of the most disappointing pieces of junk I've bought in a while. We bought this scanner for its negative/slide/photo scanning capabilities. It did all of those things well until the warranty ran out. Then without warning it just stopped functioning. I can turn it on and it sits and makes a high-pitched squealing noise and that's about it. It did great quality scans, but for the price I'd expect a bit more life out of it.As far as actual use goes it has quite a few issues. Its really large and takes up a whole lot of space. The cover doesn't stay up on its own, this is only a problem because a)its really large and b)sometimes you need two hands for setting up the stuff you want to scan. It is very slow. I assumed that that was just what it took to get a high-quality scan, but it is really a pain if you're doing multiple scans. Attempts to find a way to get it fixed have all failed."
1,Lousy printed instructions,"I have yet to get this scanner working. Granted I have not spent more than a day working on it but it is not intuitive. I have e-mailed Microtek with several questions (you cannot contact them any other way) and have received a response advising me to look at several downloads on their website. The downloads are the same instructions included in the box with the scanner when purchased. At the moment all I want to do is to use the scanner as a copier. There don't seem to be any instructions for that process, only for scanning, and those aren't great. At this point, I'm very disappointed in my purchase."
4,Beautiful and interesting but a bit short on written content,"I just read it last night. The pictures are beautiful, intimate, and candid. Everyone looks so relaxed. But there was not actually that much content in the written part of the book. I was surprised because it looked like a long book with lots of info from the outside, but has huge print. It was more like an essay than a book.What makes it great is to hear from someone that was there, and to see the Beatles in unrehearsed moments. I loved it!Beautiful!"
5,Stunning pictures of the Beatles,"The images in this book are truly amazing. To see The Beatles in such casual poses and such an informal setting is a true treat, especially when compared to some of the more 'posed' and 'managed' photographs of them in the later stages of their career.Saltzman's intimate observations add depth and perspective in ways that very few other books even attempt. Widening the range of his observations and comments to include the people who surrounded The Beatles - Mia Farrow, Donovan, wives and girlfriends - lends a view to their 'real', everday lives that is a rare treat.I highly recommend this book to both the serious collector and the casual observer of The Beatles' phenomenon."
5,Great reference bok for our Talmud Study course,"This is a great book for our Talmud Study class. Our Rabbi directs us to various portions to illustrate points he is making while teaching us about the Talmud, the Oral Torah."
2,Disappointing,"I like Greg Palast's work as an author, but in this DVD, he's just plain awful. He walks around in a trenchcoat and fedora (you know like a ""real investigative reporter""!) and it's really hard to take him seriously. Some of the more emotional interviews he gets are good, which is the only reason I'm not giving it just one star. Everything else is old news, no new ground is really covered, unfortunately. Stick to writing, Greg, you're much better at it."
1,Greg Palast is an idiot,"I knew renting this movie was a mistake the minute the DVD menu came up. What's with these documentary makers? Do they think we have the attention spans of lobotomized cocker spaniels? Why does every damn documentary produced in the last ten years look like it was edited by someone with Tourette's syndrome...on speed? By chance, I saw ""The Great Dictator"" and ""Dr. Strangelove"" right before I saw this stupid movie, and if you want to see biting satire and mockery of the powerful, go see those. (For all you knee-jerk Bush haters, I am reviewing the movie, not the allegations made in it.)"
5,Tell your Republican (+ undecided) friends to watch this!,"This is such an important movie to see before the 2004 election, especially if you are undecided! Everyone needs to see the damning evidence presented in this DVD of exactly how Bush and his cronies stole the 2000 election! It's amazing that he was allowed to stay in office! Why was nothing done to impeach him?!?! Once you see this, you will definitely want to vote him out, no matter if you are a Democrat or a Republican."
4,a little large,"I have the larger mens version of the Casio atomic watch, and I love it. so I wanted one for my wife, and was excited to see the ""baby g"" line. However, its still a little large for a dainty lady's wrist. She wears it to work (in the Elementary school), and it really holds up to the abuse an active teachers aide gives it. She doesn't wear it out to dinner or a show, but definitely wears it almost every day for her busy workday.Overall: Happy with purchase, but consider when you would use it. An active outdoor lifestyle is well suited for this rugged watch, but on a petite woman (like my wife), the size is a little awkward at times."
3,Not So Tasty Science,This is a super fun project for kids and allows them to use their imagination while learning. Some experiments are complex and need adult supervision. Overall a good product but some of the flavors included are funky and leave a bad aftertaste.
5,FUN,This has fun cooking experiments and is what was advertised. It is interesting and the directions are easy to follow. It is not something a child should use by themselves and requires adult supervision and assistance. I has been a great way to spend time with my son.
3,Not for kids with food allergies,"I bought this as a gift for my nephew who has a severe peanut allergy. When it arrived, the first thing I looked at was the nutritional/ingredient list just to make sure. There is nothing in the ingredient list, but it says that it is processed in a facility that handles allergens. I checked the company's website, but they do not mentioned it at all there either. Unsure what ""allergens"", but not worth the risk."
5,A Most Disturbing Book,"'Men Behind Bars' is not a novel, it is not flashy.What the book does do is relay prisoners' actual tales of sexual assault in prison to the reader as part of an attempt to record and study the level of sexual abuse behind bars. The authors wisely stay out of the way and let the prisoners' words convey the terror and hopelessness of their situations.This is not a pleasant book to read, but you'll never forget what those interviewed in it have to say."
3,Interesting,"This is a very infromative book in regards to hat happends behind bars. However, I have to admit it reads like a text book material locker room/[prision] [...] projection fantasy. But work reading."
1,Terrible Frame,"This is a bad frame. Poorly made, the black hinges on the back, which hold your picture in, show throught the crystal frame. One expects better from Reed & Barton"
4,Uppababy basinet stand,Solidly built. Attractive styling in the walnut color. It has the attachments so the basinet locks in place as it does on the stroller. Clever that this can turn into a laundry hamper so not just one of the throw away things you buy for babies. The downside is it is quite expensive and you have to pay extra for the hamper bags.
4,Series,This series would have been much better if it had all three street fighter movies instead of the alpha that came with it it. Messed up the experience alot
1,Thanks for all the reviews,"After hearing a review of the book on the radio, I was thinking of purchasing this book; however, after reading the reviews - I think I'll pass!!!If it's full of ""LIES"" - no thanks - I'll spend my money on something more worthwhile.My thanks to Mary ""Southie Born"" - I'll believe you before I do Shea - again thanks for your honest input."
2,Interesting from a clinical perspective,"If you would like a guided tour through the mind of a dim-witted sociopath, this is the book for you."
1,Worst book I ever read,"All I kept thinking while I tried to read this dumb book was that if every crook who committed a crime and went to jail wrote a book when he got out, we'd have libraries filled with lousy books. But few could be worse than this boring, stupid book. I tried to find one good thing to mention but I couldn't. I wasted my money and time reading this piece of junk. The least I can do is help others save their money. Something's really wrong when a book like this gets published. I'm interested in everything to do with Whitey Bulger, but this book told me nothing I didn't already know. All I know now that I didn't know before is that I'm as big a dope as this guy Shea. He wrote the book. But I was stupid enough to buy it and read it. Don't follow in my footsteps."
1,"bottom of the barrel for ""Southie"" books","I agree with most of the complaints of the other reviewers here. The constant macho posturing. Not really much info about Bulger in here. Its mostly about the author. I've read many books on this subject and this guy is never mentioned. The first four pages are telling, I think. Bulger has long been rumored to be gay or at least bi-sexual. I suspect the opening of this book may be related to this guy maybe being talked about as one of Whitey's punches. It would explain a lot."
1,Corrupt egomaniac rants,"I bought this book to learn about the criminal underworld in Boston. This book is just a rant about one guys sleazy life and his twisted loyalties, not to mention, it is very poorly written. He is adept at using expletives and describing how he takes advantage of young girls, but not much else. I think he made it up as he went along. Stick to a more factual book like Carr's for some real info."
3,very good,"This video is very good if you don't have a lot of time and want to do a condensed but relaxing yoga session. After doing this tape a few times, it prompted me to join a yoga class at my local park district, and now I've been practicing Yoga for 3 years. I still use this tape when I'm pressed for time or when I miss a Yoga class even though I'm no longer a beginner."
3,great insights,This a great overview of the depression and how it impacted government decisions. It also is a fresh look at many of the government programs and how they started.
5,Keeper,"My first read of this book was from the local library. I read part of it and then ordered my own copy in paperback. This book is one to get in hardback, because it is a keeper."
4,This is great,"Sand And Water is a beautiful tribute to the artist's love, loss and recovery from the tragic death of her husband. How courageous of her to share such a personal experience with us. I'm glad she's back. Be sure to get her first album if you like this one, it is a masterpiece."
2,not what I was expecting,"I was hoping that this was a card game that included and built upon the concept of urban escalation. Instead this is a very very simple card game based on numbers.....simple numbers....and the cards have pictures on them of urban trouble makers. There are 13 different pictures...several of which are gun related, not that I am against that in a satirical perspective of urban angst .....just that...I guess the artist ran out of ideas.I think that even a second grader wouldn't want to play this game more than twice."
3,Tea Tim Anti Againg cream,This cream goes on nicely and it is not greasy. It has a light scent. If you want it for anti aging buy a different product. This not not get rid of wrinkles.The seller does ship fast.
4,As a teacher and Czechophile I found this an amusing read.,"One may wonder why a reviewer would take the time to write an insightful negative review nearly as long as the book itself. Some people just want an amusing read.From Chapter X: ""Beata was of the opinion that present-day Prague was Paris of the Twenties for the Americans. I would see, she said, that something really great would emerge out of that explosion of creativity (it struck me that it wasn't so much an explosion of creativity as an explosion of private joy at the rate of the crown to the dollar, but I held my tongue)..."""
3,idiot's guide to eclipse repair,"This book is simple if you don't know a socket wrench from a regular wrench, but when you need details to make the repair you just did not need a professional mechanic later, chilton's lacks. usefullness."
4,Baby's fave,"My kid has read this book multiple times a day for months (he's now 14 months) and loves it.Granted, it isn't building vocabulary or teaching some moral lesson, or introducing him to a new ethnic food, but man, does he love this book."
3,VERY SHORT BOARD BOOK,My 20 months old baby seemed surprised that the book ended to quickly! This board book must be no more than 10 pages as it counted 1-10 dogs.
3,Boring,"I give this book a 3-star only because my son likes to read it...again and again and again and again. I find it really boring, and not very interesting. You spend so much time making silly dog noises that the whole counting idea is forgotten. I will read it to him only if he finds it piled in the bottom of his book bin. But then I will try and hide it again so he won't find it for another couple of weeks. I know he won't learn to count from this book. Boynton should have just named it ""Doggie Sounds"", and forget about the counting."
2,Doggone Dissappointed,"Usually I LOVE Sandra Boynton's books (as does my son, age 12 months) but I found this one to be quite annoying to read. The illustrations are great, but I hate barking for 10 pages. My son loses interest too. Perhaps he'll like it better when he gets a little older and can ""bark"" along with me. I know, I know ... and by then maybe I'll lighten up a little!"
2,Better Doggie Book Choices,"Doggies Books are generally for young toddlers undergoing a short-lived phase where they are obsessed with doggies and barking noises. However, if your child is in such a phase, there are better choices out there. This book does not have very good illustrations. Real pictures of dogs, such as those found in ""Busy Doggies"" and Matthew Van Fleet's ""Dogs"", are better choices for children 10 months - 18 months. The only very good Boynton books out there (in my opinion, of course) are ""Blue Hat Green Hat"" and ""Not the Hippopatamus"" otherwise, this series is rather dull."
2,Not the best book of Sandra Boynton by far,"My 2 yr old, who normally loves Boynton's books, will not even pick this book up. As for a parent who has to read a story over, over again this book is a nightmare!! I am thankful that my son does not like it anymore than I do."
2,Annoying to read,"I love most of the Boynton collection, but this book is really annoying. Barking page after page is boring. My daughter, who is now two, has never liked it either."
4,Cute and daughter loves,"My nearly two year old loves this book and it it fun to read, for me, anyway. My husband is not a fan, but he is not the target audience either. There is no story, it is a book about dogs that bark for the amount of the number: eg. 2 is arrf, arrf, 6 is bow wow, bow wow, bow wow (or something like that). It is just a lot of fun and goofy so little ones will love it."
3,Hope you can bark and bark and bark.....,"We adore the majority of Ms. Boynton's books, but I cringe when my son decides he'd like to hear this one. It is simply barking in different volumes and ""languages"" and drives ME crazy....and I have 7 dogs!However, Ms. Boynton knows children and my son enjoys it everytime. He doesn't choose it as often as some of her other books...like Barnyard Dance or the The Going to Bed Book."
2,Not a good example of Boynton's work,"I love Sandra Boynton's books in general. Barnyard Dance and Dinosaur's Binket are two of my son's favorites, but I don't recommend this book. It's just not interesting (and never has been) to my 11 month old son."
3,doesn't heat much,"-heats a small area near the heater, not much more-can only be turned off with the remote!+easy to move around the house-very light weight-I paid about $20 for it, glad I did not pay more because it does not throw the heated air very far"
1,Electrical Hazard,"I owned this heater for one day and it fried the wiring in the bedroom it was in. When the heater turns on and off from the thermostat, be prepared for it to pull so many amps that it fries the circuit. Stay far away from this heater. If I could give it zero stars, I would."
2,Died after 1 year,"It was a fine heater, I didn't love it. I hated that you couldn't move it with out it reseting all the settings. It just died after one year (one and a half winters, so really only about 4 months). I called customer service to ask about replacing it and they said just because it was just over 1 year that wouldn't replace it even tho it was only a few months of actual use. I won't be buying another DeLonghi product."
2,This book's language is Brahmin-centric -- use with caution,"I gave too much weight to the Amazon reviews when deciding between this book and Ron Asher's Colloquial Tamil. As a complete beginner who will soon spend a year in semi-rural Tamil Nadu, I want a book that will get me up to speed as soon as possible. Hart's book is very good for learning to read. Unfortunately, a lot of the basic vocabulary (like ""how are you?"") is used only by Brahmins. It wouldn't be a problem if Hart specifically noted this, and also gave alternate phrases, but she doesn't. Although I'm a Brahmin, I want to be able to communicate with all types of people without giving offense. So, I ultimately decided to go with the Asher books. And, unlike the reviewer of Asher's CDs who found that the speakers spoke too fast, I think they are very good at approximating native speech patterns. However, the Asher book and CD should be used in conjunction -- which is not clear from the Amazon page. If I hit you you will die."
1,Unacceptable - leaky bags!,"It is unacceptable that a product made specifically to keep your breastmilk frozen until you need it would leak. We used these bags to store frozen breastmilk, and 50% of the time the bags leak when they are defrosted. If you are pumping exclusively for your breast fed baby, you know how heartwrenching it is to see that breastmilk wasted. I strongly encourage anyone NOT to use this product. The best bags we've found so far are Lanisoh."
1,Ruined 52oz of milk!,"I stored 5.5 days worth of milk between these Gerber Seal-n-Go bags and First Year storage bags. Everything in the other companies bags was fine, just like previous times I used them, however I lost 52 oz worth of pumped milk that was stored in the Gerber bags. How you ask, all of it was spoiled. All the over 100oz of milk was handled and stored the exact same way, and only the bags of milk stored in the Gerber bags were spoiled. Thanks a lot Gerber, for producing bags that spoil milk!!!!"
1,Lousy Bags,"I saw these on sale so I thought I would try them. Wow...what a mistake!! They are too thin, leak easy, and don't seal properly. I use the Lansinoh bags and have much better experience with them. I especially like the double zipper on the Lansinoh bags; gives me 'warm fuzzies' to know I successfully closed the bag. The milk it too valuable to risk leaky and inefficient bags. I won't try other bags anymore...Lansinoh all the way!"
1,DON'T BOTHER!!!!,"these bags leaked terribly....milk was only frozen for 2 months or so....most of these bags leaked....if you plan on freezing breastmilk, GET THE LANSINOH BAGS!!!! they are thicker, they have a double seal, and i don't think we've had a single lansinoh bag leak yet. the gerber bags are a joke, gerber should be ashamed for even putting them out for sale. you'd be better off trying to freeze your milk in a sandwich baggie."
5,Best step ladder around,This is the best ladder. It is so light and yet so sturdy. I have 2 of them and they both get plenty of use.
5,Fantastic,"Sharp witty comedy about self-centred people at a television show production company named Pyramid. Very smartly written, charcters you will love and love to hate as they work to stab each other in the back and to gain the approval of their boss (Alan Roy); a man who got his start in producing trashy soft porn flicks and thinks The Sting 2 was a great movie. Highly recomended"
2,"Slow, hard to make it through","Usually, Salvatore can pull me into his stories, but Wulfgar's wallowing is not something that I could stomache. I love the high action, scimitar twirling and dynamic antics that I've come to expect from Salvatore. Personally, I'd rather have seen Wulfgar stay dead and keep me from trying to wade through page after page of self pity and drunkenness."
4,Good Book,"I thought that it was a pretty good read. This is definitely different than other RAS books within the series. It had a slow start; but that is probably due to the fact that I am too accustomed to the fast paced starts of Drizzt and pals. The ending was pretty good. Left a nice opening for sequels. And like everyone esle who reads RAS, I can't wait for the next book in line. I hope RAS writes it soon."
3,Not what I was hoping for,"I was a bit hesitant going into this book, what with it being about Wulfgar only. It was good to focus on a character other than Drizzt, but it could have been handled better in my opinion. I think that the Auckney parts of the book could have been lessened. Are these characters going to be recurring? If they are not, then spending half of a book on them is kind of a waste. I'd rather that there would have been more Wulfgar ( like three-fourths) and then spend a bit of time discussing what Drizzt were up to. I read it in a day, but not because it was a page turner. I think it was more a feeling that once I finished it I could start to anticipate the next one."
1,Salvatore's worst book i read,"The series' name is ""legends of drizzt"". drizzt do'urden is a magnificent character, any one of the books about him is better then the previous.The name of this book should have been ""the legend of wulfgar"", which is a charachter that I personally don't like.I finished reading this book in five times the amount it took me to finish it's previous one, and I finished it only because I wanted to read the next one, which I started reading a short time before I have started writing this review. I hope that the 13th book of ""legends of drizzt"" will be good enough to make the reading of the previous a wise thing.Hope you felt otherwise,A.H"
2,not one likable character,"The main story is alright at best.It often cuts to a long winded and bland story about peasants and a ""king"" all of which have no redeeming qualities, even the one ""interesting"".The main story moves nowere then suddenly to the only logical path, ffs. cutting back to the peasnts, as he often does..."
1,Maybe Stretching Isn't a Good Idea,"When Wulfgar is the most interesting character in a book [and only about half of it to boot] you know you're in for a snoozer. Don't waste your money people.Has anyone else noticed a disturbing trend of ""transitional novels"" where nothing happens but the ending guaranties that a grand adventure is in the offing? Another pathetic example of stretching those post-Thanksgiving turkey surprises into literary tryptophan."
3,Not Salvatore's best work.,"I was disappointed w/ this book. Salvatore has set such high expectations in his other books that I expected this story to flow much more smoothly, and overall be more entertaining. The book meanders through a dark and gloomy Luskan setting, then bounces to an equally uninteresting love story between new characters. I found myself not caring in the least for the love-stricken Meralda or her peasant family. Overall, Salvatore's description of battle scenes is still elaborate and vivid, but the action in this book is few and far between. If you can get past the mostly dark and non-dynamic story line, then following Wulfgar's tortured spiritual and mental journey is somewhat entertaining. Though I feel like this story was somewhat forced and less engaging than most of his books, I would still recommend it to Salvatore's fans. (but don't set expectations too high)"
1,The Spine of the World is a waste of money & time,"I'm a loyal fan of this series, but was greatly disappointed with this book. A whole novel on romance, and Wulgar's boring problems. Come on!!! I just hope that Salvatore writes a better book than this one, cause I ready to never ready one of his novels again. I was so bored, that I almost gave up half way through the novel. Basically, you should avoid this novel!"
5,THANK YOU!,"Mr. Salvatore, thank you for finally writing a book that's actually ABOUT something!In the Spine of the World RA Salvatore shows a great leap forward in his ability and maturity as an author. This book goes so way beyond the stereotypical action/adventure of his previous Drizzt books . . . it was a pleasant surprise and has made me look forward to the next one more than I have since The Legacy. GREAT BOOK!"
3,"Okay, but not great","I prefer this style to the mesh ones because it's easier to grab loose tea out of a bag and the hinge tends to be stronger and stay closed better. However, for some reason, it's harder to find - both in stores and online. I've been borrowing one of my mom's that she's had for ages, and decided I needed a few of my own, but this brand doesn't seem as high-quality as the old one. As other users have said, it tends to have an ""overbite,"" plus the metal is a bit thinner and weaker. I still prefer it to the mesh ones, but I'll keep looking for the ""perfect"" version."
5,Good,"This tea spoon works just as well as the ""tea infuser"" spoon. I purchased both at the same time to compare each other especially since one is two dollars more than the other."
4,A warm read,"I like this book because its an easy read and the instructions on how to contact my angel was simple.One concern I have is that Kim O'Neill mention that Marilyn Manroe is an guardian angel, this is veryhard to believe cause Marilyn was not exactly an angel on earth, she was involve in drugs, sex, alcoholand partying having affairs with married man. I can't see these type of behaviors would be angelic."
2,Kindle ≠ Print,"Similar to another review found on here, I was comparing the text locations for my kindle edition and the page numbers of a print version, and found that they did not match up. The kindle edition is not the same Aug. 2010 version as the print version. I'm highly disappointed, as I needed this book for a class--wasted my money needing to now buy both versions. If you're looking for specifically the new, updated version of this book, don't buy the Kindle edition."
1,Requires nothing more than .5 stars,"This movie was nothing more than a plagurised bowl of horses pizzle. This drivvle wasted some 95 minutes of my life and now I going to die in the unfortunate knowledge that Directors are creating this type of dung and that, due to false advertising, people like me die a younger age. This is the type of a movie that turns potentially famous directors into withering wreck and thereby making it bankrupt. These movie should be made illegal. Thank you from ruining my life."
3,So-So not great compared to Naked Gun Movies.,"I love Leslie Nielsen Movies. But felt this compared to The Naked Trilogy felt very little to be desired. it was still funny. and I love that it spoofs that stupid fugitive movie with harrison. Also, Adam Walsh makes a Kick butt small cameo appearance. it's okay movie but don't expect much."
5,A hilarious movie that will make you laugh till you choke!,"This movie shows the best of Leslie Nielson's comedy ability, from a drama about revenge to Mission: Impossible's computer room. You'll find yourself constantly saying, ""This reminds me of this one scene in Wrongfully Accused...""!"
2,postage due,Sadly this caused the recipients (my daughter and her boyfriend) a lot of trouble. It came postage due and wasn't redelivered even after they paid the extra 59 cents or whatever. Don't you have a post office with a scale?
4,QuickTime Videos!,"I bought this CD just for the promise of videos! You get 4 QuickTime movies of their videos: ""Barrel of a Gun"", ""Home"", ""It's No Good"", and ""Useless"". Each one is about 40 MB. Fair resolution and sound quality. The audio tracks on the CD of Home and Useless are average, nothing outstanding to write ""home"" about (ha ha). I good value for the fan if you're looking for something different."
4,<Dimensional>,"""Home"" is a unique song, I like the album version best. The other mixes are not bad. ""Useless"" is cool and the first remix is phat. It's also a CD-ROM that has 4 great videos. DM got it goin' on..."
2,Nothing new here,"This book is more or less a repeat of the introduction to the Complete Price Guide to Watches, by the same author. Save yourself time and money by buying the latter work, which is much more informative on watch pricing and contains all the information in this one."
4,Nice book - good info,"I bought this with a few other books on the same subject. The material is presented well, but I'm still deciding my interest level, so I'll use it for reference more than for current information."
4,Noon on his watch,"Beaucarmen shows noon on his watch. I'm getting groceries. Sure, I want to wait, but not until we marry. Can show the date not being interested in fakes of anything, Beaucarmen might sing Allentown only in the shower. Doing this risks the ruin of his tan line. Difficult to catch the bus without boasting a timepiece, the bearded time traveling only disciple capable of a Class-D license sees the display, spits out. These contenders. Tricky slider windows of pull-in, push down. The last day with graded papers into it goes shrubs. But those final drafts."
2,Disappointing,"Gargoyles is a minor work by a great writer-it teems with the kind of obsessive intensity that makes his prose great, yet at the same time it isn't good at all. Thomas Bernhard sets his self-consciously Kafkaesque fantasy with the journeying of a father-physician and his son as they encounter a number of grotesque patients throughout the wooded terrain. The main section (or Gargoyle if you life), involves an extended monologue with a Prince who is losing his dynasty and his mind. The book revolves around these passages, and yet they are infuriatingly repetitive (not in the deepening way Bernhard normally employs). For all its oddities, this novel is a lesser achievement from a remarkable prose stylist."
4,Hell yeah!,This is a great rendering of the JPJ story. He really was an American hero. He really was great at it! But the book doesn't just build up a famous guy. It also explains the trials and problems he caused during his campaigning. It also explains how much of his success was because he was lucky. And he was lucky. But every American should read it to understand one aspect of how we became a great power. Every Brit should read it to understand how we kicked their butts too! You really can't let yourself get complacent.
4,navy historian's view,"Mr. Callo is an excellent writer who analyzes Jones' carrer with many of the special insights of a naval officer. Dealing with his men, tactics in battle and the interface between the navy and the political bosses. Quite a contrast to Evan Thomas' portrayal of Jones attacks on England in a political context."
3,She is a fantastic saint. The book is not,The book was a story not a book on a Saint. I would not recommend buying the this book. Save your money
2,A Good Few Hours Wasted,"This is another fishing book that moves away from fishing, and into the life tale. I guess that might excite some, but it is not what I was hoping for in a book. I mean, really if I wanted funny stories I would call my dad, and not waste the price of this book. Pop is far funnier. What I wanted was stories about guiding sports through days of fishing. There is only brief mentions of this activity. The bulk of what is discussed is just his sad excuse for living. It's a lonely business and one in which he makes dumb decision after dumb decision. As it was, there was just not enough fishing to make me love this one. I wonder based on his other book if all this stuff was lived or just thought up now I think of it, but anyway it was not a favorite read of mine. Avoid!!!!!"
3,"Most excellent information, but...","This book is quite thorough, as mentioned in the other reviews. The ""but"" is major, though.... The type font is VERY DIFFICULT on the eyes. I absolutely love pearls, drool over them, even. I gobble up any information on them. If the GIA offers a specialization in them, I will get it. But the lines in this font are so thin, and the size is so tight and small, I haven't been able to finish a fourth of the book, and I've had it over a year!Every time I try to read it, I have to put it down after only a few pages. By the way, my vision is great, corrected to better than 20/20. Perhaps my copy (bought at the Metropolitan Museum of Art store) was printed when the ink source was running low..."
4,too long,"a very good cd but towards the end it starts mellowing out big time, could easily cut about 4-5 songs out and then it would be nothing but hits"
1,Not Satisfied,"I placed this order in food faith, expecting a product that would be consistant with other used CDs I had ordered from other sources. What I got was a CD in a good used case, but the CD will only play on one of my three players without skipping. I cleaned the CD but its use is still limited, unlike the other used CDs I have ordered. I immediatly wrote via email to this seller and asked for another copy of this CD, or to exchange it or get my money back. The seller never bothered to answer. I will not buy from this seller again, and do not recommend them at all."
4,"The greatest ""Greatest Hits"".","Sometimes it just takes a few collections released to get it right, and I guess that's the case with Pat Benatar. Finally here we get all the hits, five more than on ""Best Shots"", and remastered as well. This was much needed since she was one of THE female rockers of that era. Even today it's so great to hear ""We Belong"", ""Shadows Of The Night"", ""Hell Is For Children"", and ""We Live For Love"". And now they all sound even better. I personally love ""One Love"" also, and am glad it ends this album. Pat still released good music after the 80's, but there's no doubt that during that decade she was ""Invincible""."
5,Great Compilation of Hits from An Incredible Vocalist,"I recently purchased this CD and was pleased with how many of Pat Benatar's hits were included. This was certainly a great value. There were many songs I had forgotten that she had done and was pleasantly surprised to hear them again.The CD sounds great too and you can really turn the volume up in the car and rock out.My favorites are:We BelongHeartbreakerInvincibleLove Is A BattlefieldShadows Of The NightAgain, a great collection of songs which covers Pat's incredible career!"
4,SEXY FLAME,"Mr. Benet came out with no bars! With his sexy first c.d. true to myself Eric Benet shines like a diamond in the rough. He's different from others that sing with his heart open and his soul on his sleeve! I liked the fact that he made a song for the ladies that describes us to a T ! Also with songs like Lets Stay Together and True To Myself your sure to bump this in your c.d. players everywhere! So give it a try, because you won't be let down!"
5,A much needed book to reclaim the sacredness of our bleeding.,"I teach classes on the blood mysteries and Lara Owen's, 'Her Blood is Gold' is the foundation for my work. Lara brings forward information on the magic and richness of menstruation, taking us deeply beneath the layers into what's really happening to us when we bleed. So much has been lost to us in the way of rites of passage for young women, and teachings of how meaningful and powerful our bleeding is. Lara returns much of this to us through her beautifully written book. I cannot recommend this book highly enough - it is truly life changing. I applaud you Lara, for your courage and your wisdom. The circle of wise women is coming back!!Shonagh Home [...]."
4,"interesting, but . . .","While many of us find Virtue Ethics an oddly intiguing, if perhaps atavistic, field of study, I wonder if we are not falling victim to a wishful nostalgia. In an era when morality is confused at best and non-existent at worst, Aristotle's views are comforting, to say the least. Not many in the field know the subject as well as MacIntyre, and I would suggest this book to anyone interested in Virtue Ethics; however, does MacIntyre pose any answers for the contemporary moral agent? Well . . . Also, MacIntyre spends far too much time arguing against analytic philosophy and the like. Any sophomore philosophy major could do the same."
5,Excellent insight to San Diego's geology,"An excellent book! I find myself continuously recommending it. Fascinating from a geology and local interest point of view. I'll never look at La Jolla, Mission Bay and Point Loma the same way again."
3,Starts Out Slow; Informative Throughout; Exciting Finish,"I'm afraid ""The Greatest"" is not the greatest book on Muhammad Ali. It is tedious in its construction and rather boring for the first couple of chapters. However, it does manage to pick up some steam in the middle chapters, granting the reader some excellent insight into the behind-the-scenes happenings of Ali's boxing life. The author delves into his days with the Nation of Islam, his early marriages and even the intimacies involved in the boxing world. The final chapters of the book are very good, as we are given an almost round-by-round account of some of Ali's greatest matches, against Joe Frazier and George Foreman. If you can endure the slow beginning of this book, the finale is well worth the wait."
2,Why so expensive???,"This looks like a great book. And it must be, for $177 dollars!! That makes me sad."
3,just okay & and a little too preachy,"This was a quick book to read and full of adventure, but the characters sometimes bugged me. The characters always seemed to escape danger too conveniently and just in time making the story somewhat predictable, but it was a tolerable story with a happy ending. The main character Tillie was a overtly preachy - almost to the point of being too good to be true, which was one of the things that annoyed me when reading this book."
4,This book isn't idiot proof but...,"As a lazy guy I would like to see a cd rom full of predeveloped excel .xls & powerpoint .ppt preformated files so that I only have to input numbers to spit out presentable data, charts & graphs. I think the later edition has a cd with some preset math / data files. However, this book is a start. I would recommend the reader to read (purchase?) other statistical quality control books & material to complement this book. If you are math heavy it would help in understand SQC & SPC. As the only book that is titled specifically for the food industry I will treat this book with respect & TLC (until my company's audit is over)."
4,Research Methods,I used this book for my Research methods class and found it somewhat useful. The book came in great shape
5,fuel line repair kit,Exactly what I needed to repair my Craftsman blower.And prompt delivery from the dealer.
1,What's with the price??,"I have seen the EXACT SAME mobile in three other online stores at HALF the price of this one! Unless it comes wih a person who will go in and wind it WITHOUT waking the baby, I'll happily order it someplace else at half the cost!"
2,Tea for Rarefied Individuals,"This book instructs in the use of tea, with all its accoutrements, for fine living. This is useful for people who have room for collections of pitchers, teapots, wooden trays and fine linens. It helps if you have a ""buttery"" off the kitchen, as does Alexandra Stoddard, where you can store items such as your glass swizzle stick collection. Ironing those lovely linen napkins needn't trouble you. Make it part of the rituals. Iron on rainy days while you listen to lovely music. No problem! An added bonus is the suggestion for spending hours in bed while you drink tea, write letters and read. This book reveals that Oprah filmed Stoddard doing just that."
1,"poor information, no research, and kind of egotistical","This book ends up being a personal account of Ms. stoddard's day-to-day life, which is really far from interesting. As far as information on tea, it is sadly lacking and even, on occasion, presents inaccurate information; a much better choice would be Jane Pettigrew's The Tea Companion. If you want a disorganized, ""dreamy"" little book about nothing, this is it. The question arises: who would compose a work that is so self-absorbed?"
3,A Fair Piece of Equipment,The first resistance cable I bought broke on me. I am glad I did not get hit in the face. It looked as though the tube was cut with a knife. Amazon was nice enough to send me a new one.
3,Basic,"I personally liked the book for its history section, the kicking tecniques section and the ""fitness"" section. The demonstration of the form was in my opinnion not wery god, it consited of a series of pictures without text wich makes it almost impossible to understand the movements. All in all an interesting book from witch tou can learn a lot about Kung-Fu in general but not the forms.."
4,Excellent,"Room were a late 60s jazz rock band. This, as far as I know, is their only album.But what an album. Pre Flight features big band jazz, heavy blues, and hard rock. Room had a female lead singer, and recorded with a big, open sound. The singing is above average. The vocalist has a big voice that reaches the upper ranges, and her phrasing is geared towards jazz. She is not, like many other of the period, a Janis Joplin clone.The guitar playing is red coal hot, and the rhythm section moves the band with a jazz propulision. Most of the styles on Pre Flight are styles handled by progressive bands of this era, but Room has the ability to make these sound fresh and vibrent.Great album for fans of Cream, Zappa and Soft Machine. Room does it all and does it all well."
1,rip off,"Very disappointed. There was no options for English sub-titles in spite of product discription saying there was. The first Disc was defective would not play in any of my DVD players. The other Disc played but did not offer a set up option. Could not enjoy it since I don't understand Cantonese. Thought of sending it back, but not worth the time effort or aggrevation. So I just threw it in the garbage. I'll never buy a Chinese TV series online."
1,"HAW, HAW, HAW!!...great for a few chuckles...","...published by ""Bodacious Publishing"" no doubt because no legitimate publisher would touch it with a ten foot pole...just a typical ""personal success"" book of which there are literally hundreds available...and if you like Tony Robbins no doubt you'll like this book as well...but has anyone ever verified any of the claims the author makes in the book?...I doubt it...but goodness knows she's good at marketing -- she's got a blog plus at least two other websites pushing her stuff and her services as a ""motivational speaker""...by the way you can get this book FREE as an ebook from her ""gobodacious"" website by providing an email address."
2,Back to the drawing board,"While the author clearly offers some interesting channels of thought, the whole picture needs to be shaped up quite a bit to justify more than a 2-star rating.While the storyline has some interesting ideas to offer, the characters are flat and see no development throughout the story. The language is rather coarse at times, and the book features so many typos that it can be considered a miracle in itself given these modern days of automatic spellchecking.With regards to the progression of the story, many areas are opened up and left unexplained. Likewise, large gaps occur in the timeline."
4,Dourado a Dane Maddock Adventure,Dourado is the first in a series of books by David Wood involving the main character of Dane Maddock. Not going into the actual story; if you like authors such as Jeremy Robinson who blend history or mythology and present times and science and adventure; I think you will enjoy this book. Following a figure from biblical times leads Dane and his group to unearth a long lost secret the some might not want to bring to light.
1,Disappointing,"I received this item as a Christmas gift. It worked when first received, but it turned on even when a bird flew by and then it wouldn't stop, so we had to quit using it. We tried again this spring and it wouldn't work at all, even with fresh batteries. So it has been a waste."
5,First Time Amazon.com DVD Buyer,"I purchased ""The Two Worlds Of Jennie Logan (MGM Limited Edition Collection)"" from importcds. Since I had ordered this during the Christmas holiday I expected to have some delay in delivery; much to my surprise I received this rather quickly! The quality of the dvd was great; I only wished it offered Closed Caption as my mother has a slight hearing problem. We both love this movie and are so excited we were able to add it to our DVD collection!"
3,Two Worlds of Jenny Logan,Disks were obviously copied from a VHS tape so it is grainy! It was a made for TV movie so I was glad to find it but it is not the best quality viewing!
5,"Smart, Romantic, Time Travel - the ultimate Chick Flick","I have no idea why this movie is so hard to find. Everyone that I know who has seen it, loves it. It's well worth the effort to find it. It's not a major release, so some of the production value leaves something to be desired, but the story is beautiful. Lindsey Wagner is perfect in the role of Jenny, bringing a special sense of romance and intelligence to the part. I can't imagine anyone else in this role. Marc Singer is the sexiest he's ever been in his role as a tortured painter from a bygone era, who draws Jenny back into the past. If you feel like falling in love, this is your movie."
3,The Two Worleds of Jennie Logan,I have always loved the idea of time travel and how love transends through time. I enjoyed this movie when it first was shown many years ago and was pleasantly surprised when I could purchase it now.
5,Great Video,"This movie was really great and sooooo beautiful, will watch it again and again and again. The video was really good quality also. thanks."
5,ITS OUT ON DVD!,"I wanted this movie on dvd but amazon didn't offer it.. So I did some searching online and I found a website that offers old movies on dvd. Jennie Logan was one of them, I was soo excited... [...], and they use paypal.:o)"
1,Big disappointment!,"I loved the movie ""Somewhere in Time"". So, when I read the reviews that this movie was simular, I bought it. This movie was so cheesy. Most of the reviews are usually accurate but the reviews for this movie weren't even close."
5,1980 Chicago Session,"Remastered direct to digital, this Norman Dayron produced 1980 Chicago session has Michael in good form backed by an excellent band including Mark Naftalin."
5,Perfect Gift,The necklace is beautiful and it was a gift to my girlfriend. She absolutely loved it! The customer service is also fantastic. They resolved every issue I had. I will definitely shop here again in the future.
4,Advanced reading for Franklin mystery detectives.,"David Woodman's research for this book is exciting to think about -- carefully turning the thousands of pages from journals written over a hundred years ago -- could he see the fear of frozen fingers (and more) in the marks of thick ink? Woodman's retelling of Sir Franklin's fascinating story is built upon an amazing act of pinning down the oral histories from another culture to the pages of ours. Above all, this book pays tribute to this wonderous art of the Inuit. And speaking of 'our' pages, my paper back edition has come unglued from its spine in just one month! Serious readers my wish to ante up for the hardcover."
3,Item is fine but not Made in USA,"I specifically searched for Made in the US items and this driver was in the results I whittled down to. Additionally, the description says the origin is USA. The product I received was marked made in China. I have numerous DeWalt products and they are quality but I was disappointed as I was specifically looking to buy US made products."
3,This is a drill...,"I went to the local tool supplier to compare this to the panasonic model cordless screwdriver. I was holding the dewalt in my hand and then walked over to pick up the Makita 9.6V drill I already had at home. The drill was lighter.For me the panasonic, being lighter and smaller, is a better fit. I've got two cordless drills, including a Dewalt 18V, for the bigger jobs."
5,"Flagship, No --Starship level cordless power scwerdriver.",Let's put it this way ................It's about time. All the rest belong in the trash...Luke Skywalker would be envious......
3,Never Received Product,"I did receive an email telling me that no one was here to accept shipment. If delivery was made after 4:30pm this is possible. But, we never received any notice telling us that an attempt to deliver was made. This I blame on the Post Office. This is not the first time this has happened to us with shipments delivered by U S Postal Services.Can't you resend this item by using UPS?"
4,one word robocop,This is one cool tool. The only thing that kept me from giving this tool a 5 star rating and pay attention dewalt engineer's is that it doesn't bend to a full 90 degree for those tight spots.
3,One important defect in design and one lesser convenience item.,"I have been an electrical contractor for over 35 years. I have experimented with many powered screw drivers as they became available. This DeWalt 920K is quality built like their other cordless tools. What I don't like is that the bit holding mechanism most often spits out the bit when you try to push it into a ladder top tool holder hole or into your pouch with other tools. Very poor holder as compared to the Panasonic cordless impact driver that I always use just as frequently on installations. Also, the forward/reverse should be more accessible and easier to operate for one handed operation. A forward/reverse all in one rocker switch would be ideal, like the Black & Decker cheaper version with the LED light on it. The switch locking feature is nice for when tool is bunched in with other tools for transport. Of course the power of this DeWalt makes me want to use it instead of the B&D."
1,Total screwup,"First one copy, then its replacement wouldn't play past 19 seconds - then they flipped back to the beginning. In addition the DVD edition of a great 1957 movie of this work - one of Molière's and Lully's greatest - started out with some insipid music and images. Since I could only play a snippet of completely irrelevant prefatory material I have no idea if the DVD transfer was any good."
3,Good but off the mark.,"This book was an easy read with characters that were very realistic. It did, however, seem to lack something and I really could never get excited to turn the pages. I was ready for the book to end and was a bit let down with the abrupt ending. It was like, ""what happened?"" '"
5,Consistent and solid,Tested this with a projector and display using different length Cat5 cables and multiple cables and we saw no signal attenuation or degradation of image or ghosting. Gefen makes a pretty solid device.
3,Disappointing...,"Although I liked Karen Bentley's other books, Glory's Rival disappointed me. The book never really got very exciting and I found myself forcing myself to read the book. Cindy usually is not bratty, but in this book all she cares about is Glory winning the Breeder's Cup. She is rude to Samantha and everyone else at Whitebrook. I thought the storyline was horrible and the conflict was not very thought-out. I would not recommend buying it, maybe instead rent it at the library or from a friend, if you feel you have to read it."
4,Ok but It Could Have Been Better.,"i think that the book was ok but it could have been better. Like the fact that Glory won the Breeders Cup Classic by 31 lengths! I mean not even most REAL racehorses today could do such a thing. Also Cindy is a brat and that is something I can agree with. it's like ""oh Samantha are you going to be mad at me if my ""WONDER HORSE"" beats you second class nag? All in all i think that the other books containing Glory are better that this one but i still have faith that they will come out with better ones!"
4,Glory's rival,well i liked the book and i am happy that Shining won the distaff but i really wished that sammy would have entered her in the classic because cindy would have deserved to lose. she is such a spoiled little brat. in some ways she is as bad as the townsends! she always wants things her way. and she usually gets them. She would have deserved to lose. i like glory just fine but to win by 31 lengths??? come on! But wait! cindy thinks that wonder's champion will be the fastest whitebrook ever had?? yikes this is gettin ugly! ne whoo i liked the book but i wish it was a teensey bit more realistic...
1,too wordy...,"Too wordy, never straight to the point. The explanations are very minimal on every concept and also add a very bad organization as other reviewers said."
2,Only knowledge list,I think this book is just a list of knowledge without good organization. Too many typos.
4,Very entertaining sci-fi,I read this perhaps 17 years ago. I remember that my copy became quite ragged through rereading before I gave it to a friend who equally enjoyed it. I'd like to think it's still being circulated amongst friends.Others have summarized the plot. I'll just reiterate that this book is a great way to spend a few hours if you're a sci-fi or fantasy fan.
4,Hunters of the Red Moon,"I read this fine novel many years ago when it was first released to paperback and was pleased with storyline and plot. As science fiction stories go this one was more plausible than many others while avoiding any sustained ""hard science"" to explain ""the how"".What you find instead is a very well written tapestry of gender, culture, and race along with certain abilities or potential of ""otherness"", to go further on this line would spoil the story for potential readers. However, I will say that once the story gets past the introduction and build up it is continuous action with riveting changes."
5,Very Entertaining,I read this book about 10 years ago and went searching for it so I could read it again. Too bad it's out of print. This book is very entertaining. It's a worthwhile read. I couldn't put it down.
4,A lost favorite,"I originally bought a printed version at a garage sale. Having read several times over the years, lost my copy. Was great to find it again and was just as good as I remembered."
3,picky about dvd-rw,This works great with dvd-r discs. However it is very picky about -RW. Still haven't found any that work with it.
2,Electronic variable speed stoped working,"I bought this router to use in router table I had a problemwith the variable speed, it just stoped working. The router would onlywork at full speed the electronics are not cheap to repair. If you own for longer than the warranty it would be very expensive to repair. Otherwize it is good router."
5,Why is this book out of print?,"Joseph Stalin is a fascinating subject. Alex de Jonge is an outstanding writer. They combine for a great book. There are other biographies of Stalin; Deutscher is a bit dry, Conquest is excellent, but perhaps a bit short. De Jonge covers his subject thoroughly, but not with so much detail as to overwhelm or lose the reader. De Jonge is an excellent writer, and he combines his talent with useful information and a plethora of fascinating, sometimes hilarious, anecdotes. He doesn't get bogged down in Marxist theory, but he does give a brief synopsis which will benefit the average reader; a scholar might wish for more. Perhaps the most outstanding and useful part of the book are those sections dealing with foreign affairs, especially in the aftermath of World War II. Brilliant analysis...."
1,Robert Louis Stevenson's St. Ives,"This movie made absolutely no sense whatsoever, and I fast-forwarded through most of it. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, and am not keeping it. No fault of seller, Amazon, etc., but the movie-maker. Awful!!!"
3,IT'S JUST OK,"Ok, Heres the real scoop on a just a ok product. You better be good at reading directions because if you don't you will be lost. I am a professional punch tech and have years under my belt working with Bondo. the product did very well as far as blending in and repairing a hole in the shower floor in which I was working in.But i found it very difficult in matching the color to the shower floor. My advice would be now that I have used the product is use the white base and use only one drop of color (yellow/brown)at a time. mixing well after each drop until you get a close match. As far as the sand paper that comes with the kit you would sand for hours just to finish one job. invest in a random orbital sander and you will be pleased. and the blending of the product turned out much nicer.I do LOVE the stenght of the product and do feel it will hold up over time.just make sure your cilant knows there could be a difference in color."
5,IT WORKS and looks good.,I had a crack in my tub where you put your back againist the tub and floor. We repaired the fiberglass and this kit worked great. The color match was a bit tricky but the color is very close to the tub color. Its only been in place a few weeks but looks like it should hold. We also resupported the tub to help correct the weakness in that area.
2,Video PR release,"I saw Keith Olberman and Bill Maher's interview and I was intrigued.This video is just a nothing but a PR bio. No science. I had thought it was something in the Carl Sagan mode. Two stars for my bad, and his."
2,Junk,"This cover is not resilient or durable at all. Using it to cover my grill in the MN winter, it got brittle and the wind almost immediately ripped it. Your money is better spent somewhere else."
1,Antisemitism in the Form of Pseudo Scholarship,"I bought this book thinking that it would be an interesting and informative study of the history of antisemitism. Just by reading the lengthy introduction, it is apparent that this is a very slanted work, whose purpose is to diminish the impact of 2000 years of antisemitism on the Jewish people, presented under the guise of scholarly research. The author is very opinionated, and apparently threatened, in that he wastes no time in criticizing the works of well known researchers in the field. He appears to be a history revisionist in the same school as David Irving.If you are an antisemite, this will be music to your ears. If not, don't waste your money on this thinly veiled excuse for research. It is just another vehicle for conveying hate."
1,Agree with the other reviewers - cheap packaging,"The promotional picture of this set is completely misleading. The books come in a cheap cardboard box that doesn't look at all like the one pictured except in the most distant sense. It's promoted as ""collectible trunk-like box with sturdy handles and privacy lock""... in reality, it's a flimsy cardboard box with a couple of shoe strings for handles. This is a total rip off, and the company should be ashamed of lying so blatantly in their promotion."
5,HP SERIES - AWESOME!!!,Are you kidding me? What you still waiting for? Just get the books and read them already! Then come back and write something so you can move a few others to read them as well :)
4,Harry Potter,Books came in a very good condition. A very good third party seller. THe books are fullof plot twists and mystery. Everything is good. Only problem was the wait. It wasn't the seller's fault though.
4,half blood prince,"so far this is my favorite one of the series, the changes as harry & the gang are coming of age and the dark lord getting closer. Couldn't wait to get to the end and find out who the half blood prince was.!!!"
1,harry potter box set,Never recieved product and as of today still dont have my money back. Doubt I will order from amazon used again
1,AVAILABLE ON AMAZON!,I want to buy the Harry Potter books for my kindle app with my amazon card. JK Rowling is like the richest woman in the world but she won't let Amazon sell the books so she can make more money! BIG DISLIKE!
4,Harry Potter audio CD,"Very enjoyable audio book. However, one CD did have some skips in it,(Book # 3). Still listening to the CD's, but overall from what I have listened to, I would rate it 9 out 10 (because of the skips!)."
2,Very poor binding,"After years of our original Harry Potters' being over-read to the point of destruction, our daughter decided she wanted a new complete set. She had barely got to chapter 2 before the pages started coming lose from the binding. I appreciate that kids can be rough on books but I assumed these would withstand at least a few years of good reading, as the previous copies we owned did. Very disappointed with this set as it just will not last the distance in this family of avid readers. The covers are flimsy and the binding is just too inferior to cope with books with these numbers of pages. Santa made a poor choice this time!"
1,Bollix,"Like many others, I clearly recall the pre-order advertisement stating that this was a wooden box. Obviously, it is not. It is cheap cardboard not worthy of starting a decent fire. I had the books in hardcover long before this atrocity arrived at my door and had I known that the company would switch the promised product with this rubbish, obviously I would never have ordered it. What truly infuriates me is that this was supposed to be a birthday present for a beloved friend of mine. As it stands, I wouldn't give the box to her cat for its litter.(The books are quite nice, the one star relates only to the box.)"
2,"Great books, horrible set...","I wanted to emphasize what other reviewers have said about the ""chest."" It is very poorly made. I saw this set in Borders (thankfully I hadn't bought it). The chest really is flimsy, folded cardboard that won't hold up to being handled much, or to holding the heavy books enclosed in it. I lifted the set in the store and the chest seams bowed open! The picture on Amazon is much better than real life. I'm not expecting wood, but this could have been made of hardened, bonded leather. If you just want a set of HP hardcover books, this might be worth it but I'd check the individual hardcover prices to be sure you're getting the best deal.The books, of course, are phenomenal."
3,Cardboard oh no,"Of course, everyone who loves this series probably already owns all of the books and even in hardback form. So, how about for a few dollars more, offering the trunk in a classier material than cardboard!? Even a plastic would have been nicer or how about a thin veneer? I am disappointed and wish I had waited to order this set before I read the reviews. We already have the whole set and now we have 2 sets and a cardboard box. Boo"
4,The paperback edition looks better.,"Like many of the people below, I agree the Harry Potter series is one of the best in the world. Easily 5 out of 5. But I gave it a 4 because of the Hardcover edition. Most people thought that the Hardcover edition (100 dollars) was totally worth it at first, and that it was worth paying the extra 50 dollars for packaging (compared to Paperback edition). I havent even bought it and I could tell by the comments below and the pictures that it is not worth it. Cardboard... I think that the paperback edition looks better... and its ALOT cheaper too."
3,Everything arrived on time from seller,Everything arrived on time. Like everyone stated the case is cardboard and will rip apart in no time. Don't get it wet.
1,"Spelling mistakes,poor printing quality.","There are spelling mistakes and a very poor printing quality in places.By the time I found these it was too late to return the books(30 days is not enough for one book,let alone seven!).The publishers have been very unhelpful skirting responsibility or being downright rude(one e-mail was blatantly sarcastic!)and have done nothing for me.WHAT ABOUT YOU ,AMAZON,WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT?I have yet to bother trying to read the last 2 books.And to think,I was going to pass the set on to my grand daughter!"
5,Great gift!,"I ordered this as a gift for my daughter, and am very happy with the presentation and quality of this box set. It definitely will be with her for a long time. I recommend this to any Harry Potter fan."
4,Loved the books since i was a child,"I have loved these books since I was a child. Harry Potter was what first got me into reading anything. I had bought all the books as they came to shelves. Unfortunatly i lost them all sometime after I moved from my parents house. So i decided to buy this box set. Let me start by saying that I was fully aware when I purchaced this from reading other reviews that they would be ariving in a cardboard box. Personaly, I am not impressed with the box but that is not why I bought this. I bought these books to read them. So if your looking for a collectors item, this isnt it. However, if you are looking for some wonderful books to read or have already read Harry Potter and want hardback copys, this set is worth it."
5,Ships in box with Harry Potter Labels,"These books are great. The presentation box is neat and my son is not hard on things so the box should hold up just fine. Unfortunately the shipping box is labeled with the words ""Harry Potter boxed set 1-7"". My son greated the UPS guy in the yard, and was thrilled to know what his birthday present was going to be. All is fine, but just be aware the shipping box will reveal the contents. All seven books in hardback make this a great deal!"
5,excellent value!,"books arrived within days, despite public holidays! I'm very happy with them, and glad to have found them at a much more reasonable price than in stores - one bookshop wanted to charge over 4 times as much as I purchased them for from amazon. Thankyou!"
1,E-X-T-R-E-M-E-L-Y- Disappointed,"The box I received is FAR, FAR, very FAR from being what I saw on the picture displayed in Amazon. I would MOST CERTAINLY NOT buy this for a child younger than 12 for it would most certainly not hold together for long. The picture/comment from B. Philip (Scotland) is right on.I bought it for decoration purposes in my personnal library and I must admit that I'm not sure I still want to put this in display.Whoever designed that mockery of a trunk could at least manage to put the joints in the back instead of the front..."
4,6 out of 7 first american editions,"I had eyed the paperback copies of this series (6 of 7 books) but prefer the hardback version which in this case contained all 7. That fact is why I settled on this set. I was disappointed with the cardboard box which is part of the cost of this set. I was really hoping for something to keep my books packed closely together that would last. The publisher really dropped the ball on that as it is one of those times that two versions of the series would have been best. I think they should have put out a cheap version of the box (this one) for those that just want to pick up the books together and a quality box for those that want the whole package. I know I would have gladly paid more for a good display box. Another fact to note is that those looking for first editions will find that Harry Potter Order of the Phoenix is a second edition. Overall though, it is a convenient way to pick up all 7 books and usually cheaper this way."
2,"Harry Potter ""Box"" Set","I was hoping that the box set would atleast be decent enough to be called as a collectible. Sadly, the final ""box"" looked nowhere close to the original advertized item. The only silver lining here was that I landed up getting a good deal on the books. My final price came out be $111.14. I had preordered this book about a month ago on Amazon. However, when I checked out the site on October 7, 2007, it said that orders placed at that time would have an additional 5% discount. So, I canceled my previous order and preordered it again to get the discount. So much for the preorder price guarantee!"
3,Packaging and binding don't do the books justice,"Scholastic did a great job designing the U.S. editions of the Harry Potter books. The illustrations are outstanding, far better than in the British edition. Unfortunately, the quality of the binding is terrible. I've had to tape the spines of three of my books, some after just a couple of readings.If you would like to buy an heirloom set, try the Special Edition set still available at amazon.co.uk. (Sorry, but I can't insert a link.) It's significantly more expensive and you have to pay overseas shipping, but the books have genuine cloth bindings with place marker ribbons and come in a nice, cloth-covered case. By all appearances, they should last a few decades. I'm very pleased with my set and plan to buy at least one more set to pass on to my children. I don't think you'll be disappointed."
3,Stay away from Prime Fulfillment !!!,"I ordered The Harry Potter Box Set on 13 June 2011. All books was to be received by 5 July 2011. I did not get the seven book until 20 August 2011. And that was only after leaving a negative feedback did I hear back from Prime Fulfillment. I sent four e-mail to Prime Fulfillment about the missing book and did not get nothing back from Prime Fulfillment. But after I posted a negative feedback, did I hear back from Prime Fulfillment. I will not be buying anything more from Prime Fulfillment. But if you have a problem with Prime Fulfillment, just post a negative feedback about Prime Fulfillment. In doing this you will get an e-mail from the company right away."
4,Love it,"The books themselves are beautiful. I love the covert art and the book look and feel.Very happy with the quality here.I also like the Hogwart's chest as a container. I agree with all the other reviewers, thechest is slightly stronger than cardboard and the latch is flimsy, but it does look nice.I probably wouldn't recommend for kids, as they'll tear it apart in no time, but as a containerto store the collector set, very nice.Overall, a 4/5 stars. One point removed for the misleading cardboard like chest but overall, I wouldbuy this set again in a heartbeat, regardless of the chest.PS. I would have recommended they made a slightly stronger chest and included a wizard's wand for fun.I would have paid quite a bit more for the addition of these 2 features, just for fun."
5,Harry Potter Hardcover Boxed Set of 7 Books,"Harry Potter Hardcover Boxed Set of 7 Books arrived safely and on time, as promissed. My daughter was anxiously waiting for the books, she finished the whole set in less than a week, it's so interesting."
1,Disappointed,"Sigh. I am very disappointed. I saw this item online back in the summer and I waited and waited for it. I know it said that it was in a wooden box/chest. I did expect a wooden box. I didn't expect a fine hardwood, but I did expect wood not cardboard. As for the price argument, again, I thought it was wood since it was almost $200! Granted Amazon offers everything on sale, but for that high price, yes, I did think it was wood. I do think it was false advertizing."
1,wrong books,"I searched for the British version of Harry Potter, found these sellers, and bought the set. When I received them I found that they were the American version and asked the seller if I could return them. They said that was not possible."
2,"books are great, treasure box not so great","The books are great, however the treasure box is not at all what the picture suggests. The closure is plastic and the cardboard cracks and breaks at the fold when opened. The inside colors of the box are off as well. Mine are very dull, not at all like what the picture shows."
3,Harry Potter Paperback Box Set (Books 1-7),The paper is not the best quality although the cover art is much more delicate than in the Latin American version. I would have liked to know more paper types before buying. Regarding the history is incredible.
4,Nice book,"The books are very good, but one of the cover jackets came freshly torn. But, the box is made out of cardboard, and it seems like a miracle that it can even hold all of the book (the books are very heavy)."
2,Not as described,"It said it was a boxed set of Hard cover books, when they arrived the first two books were paperback."
4,Collection of Harry Potter books,This was a gift for my 14 year old grandson and he loves the books. The shipment came fast and we were all happy with the product. Great value for the money.
3,paper could be so much better,"I like the books. I did get them all. BUT---they are all very poorly made as far as I am concerned. The paper is very brittle and the bindings are poor. One good read through them could destroy them. When you buy a set, you expect to hold onto it or pass it on to others. I don't think these books would hold up. I am afraid of ruining the binding or ripping a page as I carefully read them. Paper could be so much better."
3,"Great Books, Bad Packaging (x2)","GIFT WARNING!! The brown shipping box that this item is delivered in says on the outside - HARRY POTTER BOX SET 1-7, DO NOT OPEN UNTIL OCTOBER... So a word of advice, if you buy this for a gift, have it shipped to yourself or somewhere they won't see it so you can wrap it later. (-1 star)The books are great. Having all the hardcover editions in a collectible box set is what every fan craves. But this? This is box set is just embarrassing to display. It would have been better if it was just a normal box set cover, but to add a cheap lock and cheeky packaging? (-1 star)Other than that, the hardcover books are still nice to display on the bookshelf by themselves. I recommend this for any fan of the series, as long as you know what you are getting ahead of time."
5,I would tell my friends to get it,Well i like it and it is great my books are safe and they won't get damaged at all. I would tell more then a friend about it. I am gonna order from here again.
1,Sending it back,I too was disappointed in my set. I thought it would be wood but when I opened it and saw the cardboard box I immediatly got on Amazon to get a return started. I wonder how many others are doing the same thing
3,Potter's what?,"The H Potter books are excellent. It is just most unfortunate that publisher chose such a cheap and tacky way to preserve and show the collection. C'mon now....cardboard. I paid the price willingly but a note to the publisher, I would have paid even a higher price for more class!"
3,Deeply discouraged,"OK here it is, my wife already owns three complete sets of Harry Potter. My family and I love the Harry Potter books and movies. So I wanted to provide her with something that she would charish and save for years to come. So I thought purchasing this bookset with an authentic looking Harry Potter book case ""WHAT APPEARED TO BE REAL WOOD!!"" would have been great. I am deeply upset that the box is made of cardboard. If I had known this, I would not have purchased this set and would have made a box. I cannot find where the company has misled us in writing, but clearly the photo makes the box look like real wood. The company should make this right and either purchase wood chests or have them made."
2,It said box set...,"It said box set and said that it would have a box with stickers and all with it. I did not have that. All I got was the books, I'm happy about having the books again. Not happy that it didn't come with the box it was to come in. It clearly says boxed set. That is what I was hoping to get not just the books."
2,Know Why You Want It,"Before you buy this set, know why you want it. If your primary interest is in an affordable set of HP books in hard cover, this is your deal.If you are are looking for that exciting collectible...... well, not so much.The argument is not about the books themselves (there is no question that they are fabulous.) It is about *this* set.I was disappointed. For the price, I didn't really expect more than cardboard, but I DID expect better cardboard and hardware that was not plastic. Even a child's cardboard jewelry box has a clasp made of metal.I received this set as a gift and I will keep it and love it for the thoughtfulness and generosity of my son. If I had bought it for myself, however, I would return it."
4,boxset was the best thing,I believe coming out with a box set was a wonderfull idea and i had been waiting for a boxset. My only problem was that the box the books were in wasnt better quality. I belive they should have made it out of something else other than carbord.
2,MISSING 50 PAGES!,"I bought the set as a gift - it took a few months to get it to the intended - and when she got to THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX, more than 50 pages were missing!! And Amazon won't exchange or return because it's past the 30 days....FOR SHAME AMAZON!!"
5,Wonderful Birthday Gift!,"This is a handsome collection of the hardback books -- packed in a Treasure Chest complete with handles, a latch, and a label for you to fill out with the giftee's name. Very elegant and fun!"
3,Faded Printed Pages,I was disappointed with the last couple of books in the series. There were too many pages where the printing was so faint that I was unable to read the print. I had to guess what was being said by interpreting the parts that I could read.
3,"Buy it for the books, not the packaging","I bought this from Borders, in person. I'm sort of embarrassed about that, considering the cheesy quality of the packaging, but I wanted to have the full seven books, and I like that they are sealed to keep them in mint condition. When I first saw this product on Amazon.com, I thought it would be an actual box. You know, with wood. But, nope. The cardboard may have once been a tree - or at least near one, but this is not quality craftsmanship. There is already a dent in the top of mine! You are paying for the books... consider the corrugated cardboard to be a nice storage container with fun print on it. This is the perfect thing for a pre-teen, but not the quality that a serious adult fan would appreciate."
5,A GREAT overview,"A strong sampling of some of the best martial arts books around really speak to the reader. There are 4 sections, titled:Part 1: Culture and Conflict: The HistoriesPart 2: Master and Students: The PhilosophyPart 3: Training and Discipline: The WayPart 4: Other AspectsEach section includes some of the finest writing on the martial arts I've ever read. I own many of the books that are exerpted here and was introduced to others in these pages.Authors include E.J. Harrison, C.W. Nicol, Eugen Herrigel, Herman Kauz, Maxine Hong Kingston, Dave Lowry, Terry Dobson, T.T. Liang, and Linda Atkinson."
3,Fascinating Footnote to Classical Studies,"Kudos to David King for bringing us the fascinating, bizarre tale of Olof Rudbeck, who took Swedish patriotism to dizzying extremes. I must say, Rudbeck's theories, his reasoning and conclusions are strangely convincing, and King does a terrific job of laying them out for us. I couldn't help but think, however, that what would have been a few interesting chapters of a broader study on the many off-the-wall theories on Atlantis had been padded unnecessarily into a full-length book. It's a short book, certainly, but not one without its dry patches. The lengthy digressions into Swedish politics (as well as those at Rudbeck's university) can get a trifle boring. But when King sticks to Rudbeck's obsession with proving that Sweden was, among other things, what the ancient Greeks referred to as Atlantis and Hades (!), this is a mesmerizing study of a quirky, delightfully eccentric individual."
4,Received in time and product met my expectations,"look forward to read this book!Read two other books by David King, he is writing history in a most entertaining way."
1,JUNK do not buy this toy,I really wanted to like this toy. My 4 year old son couldn't do much with it to make any of the sample projects so my husband had a go at it. When I heard his grumbles of frustration I came and took over. I finally got the thing built but it was very rickety and as soon as our son started to play with it it fell apart. You should know that both of us are designers and very very handy so this is not in any way a personal flaw. I would think this would be an educational toy but if was only really a lesson in family frustration. Not Fun At All. My husband said that real tinker toys had these issues worked out so at least the pegs stayed in the holes and didn't fall apart like this ...Junk. Sadly truly a flawed design.
4,This USB Card Works!,I have read reviews and tried other PCMCIA USB cards. My laptop(s) were USB 1.0 and therefore significantly slower when using an external USB hard drive. THe other brand of USB card was neither detectable by Windows XP Pro without or with the supposed driver. The Belkin USB card installed and operated right from the start. It has been in use for the past two months without any issue. I recommend this brand and source for those looking to stretch their older laptops a while longer and also get a performance boost.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS TELEPHONE,"I bought a sister telephone (8700) with two handsets about 9 months ago and both handsets are now basically useless: I can't see who I'm dialing or who is calling me on the information screen and my callers have a lot of trouble hearing my voice, which drifts in and out. I called Coby Electronics to ask for replacement handsets, which they acknowledged were defective. However since their miserly 90 day warranty period has expired they are charging me $31.00 for the handsets which is only two more dollars than I paid for the entire phone in the first place. To add insult to injury, payment must be made by money order. Money orders are costly and involve a trip to the bank. In sum, due to the hassle and large expense, I can only assume that Coby is trying it's best to discourage anyone from obtaining replacements. I am not the only person who feels this way. They have a terrible record according to the BBB."
3,Great Photos,I was very disappointed with this book. Even though it had some great pictures it lacked in information. It just wasn't what I thought it would be. This book would be great to have just for the photos....but thats it.
5,Great Little Known Western,"The fictional story of a buffalo hunter turned showman (sound familiar), this movie is very entertaining and has a ton of machismo. Sam Elliot is perfect as Colonel Hugh Cartith (sp?) and the supporting cast is huge. If you like a western with quick banter, like Tombstone, this one has it. There is even a great cameo by Dennis Hopper as Doc Holiday."
1,looks nice but it's really uncomfortable and even gives back pain,"As the title has said, this product looks nice but it's not comfortable at all. I had feet pain and back pain from these shoes. They're in the trash now."
3,I wanted to like it more than I did,"This kid named Selig gets nicknamed Wordsworth at school by kids who call him an oddball, but he eventually goes on his quest and grows into the name. I just didn't get the appeal of a lot of Wordsworth's favorite words. ""Jibber-jabber"" I can see, but ""melted""? ""Hit""? ""Shoes""? Maybe the author wanted to include words that kids of different ages can read, but it would have been better if some reasons for his choices had been given - the sound, the meaning, ""the perfect word for the occasion,"" or whatever. I did enjoy when he threw bickering words down on the arguing neighbors, then kindly words after they grew still, and the illustrations of arguing people turning cheerful and cooperative. It was regrettable that nobody introduced Wordsworth to the pleasures of the dictionary."
5,Magical piece of Literature.,"A fellow teacher insisted I read her copy of this book. It is a positively magical, sweet, intelligent story. I love words! I would say that this is appropriate for ages 2nd grade to adult. Every intelligent household with school age children should own this incredible book. I bought three!"
4,It recreates beautifully the atmosphere of Imperial Vienna.,"Anybody interested in Viennese culture before World War I and between the wars ought to read this book. It portrays the atmosphere of a city that was one of the most influential centers of European culture, where contributions by the Jewish community were epoch-making and masterful. A must for anybody wanting to understand the marvel that was Europe."
5,Thought-provoking,This book is an excellent read. Very accessible and full of insight. It is subtle in its observations and friendly in its tone. The people you meet and their stories are fascinating and the generational dialogue is worthwhile - anyone who seeks to understand how relationships and lives are changing will enjoy this. Bravo to Ms. Bateson!
5,Great Fun,"I got this game years ago for Christmas, and it has been one of my favorite computer games ever. I love this game."
5,backyard mama,My husband used this bucket to make me a pond with plants and fish. Love the versatility of use for this bucket
3,Good but not quite as good as the 1st Mirrors,"I enjoyed the movie and it was well worth the price I paid for it, but with that being said like most sequels It didn't stand up as good for me as the 1st one! But like I said for the price I paid overall it was well worth a watch and I am happy to add it to my collection!"
1,"""Mirrors 2"" is Huge Let Down!!","""Mirrors"" was a creative, atmospheric movie about demons and contained quality acting, suspenseful moments throughout and superb special effects. ""Mirrors 2"" was a major disappointment on all levels. The acting was lame and the story was overly predictable with no surprises or shocking moments. The movie could have been part of Night Gallery's ""Sixth Sense"" series--more of a esp-crime show than horror movie. I'm glad I checked it out from Red Box for a dollar. Even at that price I feel I was ripped off. If you liked ""Mirrors"", save your money and avoid ""Mirrors 2""."
3,It was....ok.,I'm feeling extremely generous this morning.I'll give the movie three stars because of Nick Stahl.I really liked him in T3 and it's kind of sad to see him wasting his time on movies like this.Ok......the good.I sort of enjoyed the first Mirrors.So I was curious what they would do with this one.Well...the FX are decent.Nick is good.There are a few decent scares in the beginning.The music is done well.The bad?The first Mirrors was good but was it good enough to warrant a sequel?I'll have to say no.The gore was phony and total over kill.The senseless nudity which sorry adds nothing to the film.The story line dissolved into complete rubbish by the end of the movie.It was watchable but I can see why it didn't make it to theaters.I'll recommend a rental to anyone who loved the first one or people like me who can't help but watch a train wreck once in a while.I hope the souls trapped in the mirrors have enough sense to do away with anyone who tries to make a third movie.
1,wrong item,I can't review something you keep sending me when it's the wrong bible. you don't have the one I ordered. you don't have the one that you have on your sight. so you send me a diffront one the one I ordered was printed 2/3/1994 and you send a book printed in 2003.
3,No Dawn???,"How can anyone claim to have the very best of the Four Seasons with the song, ""Dawn""? Even another reviewer mentions Dawn... first... and yet it is not on this album..."
3,2 out of 3 aint bad,"This triology of novellas is not as compelling as Transpotting or The Acid House. The first story was a little unbelievable but enjoyable for all that. The second story was utterly compelling, but would have worked better as a full length novel (the story could have done with a bit of flushing out)- but good, despite that. The third story is boring and pointless."
2,Disappointed,"After Trainspotting, which was one of the best books I had read in a couple of years, Ecstacy was a letdown. The great thing about Trainspotting is how the characters all come to life through their distinctive voices. Unfortunately Ecstacy misses it. The first two stories especially. The dialogues are flat, the characters are stock characters, the plots themselves are stale. Kind of like a bad tv detective show where they throw some kinky sex and drugs on top of tired cliche, so it seems ""hip"". The last story was a little better. LLoyd was OK. At least he had some life in him. But over all, not really worth it"
3,"tales of love, drugs, and raves","this was an interesting book. it involves the lives of people what are into the UK club scene. there wasnt a ton of chapters about the partying, and thats why i gave it 3 stars. i expected a little bit more from it."
3,Good read if you can do just that,"If you're a Welsh fan and have just came from one of his previous books I believe you'll enjoy this one. It's got 3 witty short stories that include great characters and even better situations. However, since this is my first book to have read from Welsh I found it extremely difficult to follow along with the strong dialect. In turn the book took me forever to get through.Although the book was well rounded with characters and a great story line, I don't believe I'll come back to Welsh."
4,Irvine Welsh does it once again!,"With Trainspotting and The Acid House you would have thought that things could not have gotten much better for Irvine Welsh. But things did. Ecstacy is a well thought out, fast paced novel. Quite dissimilar to The Acid House it does completely center around depravity but rather it almost seems to encorparate happieness. Of the three stories, they all are extremely good, but I'd have to say that the Office Romance is the best. Unfortunatly each one follows a similar style of writing quality. They dissapointingly start off with just an acceptable writing quality, and then always finish in Irvine Welsh's fantastic world renowned way of either leaving you in a state of disbelief or awe. Brilliant."
3,They don't seem all that sturdy...,They seem to be made of plastic. Every time I use them they seem to feel like they are going to break. They haven't yet.
3,Harbinger padded push up bars,These work fine. They are a little light on the padding and depth ability but stable for wide push ups. The price is right for what they offer.
5,The pushup bar standard,"Solid bars, provide great support and are sturdy. These are exactly what you need for those push-up workouts. Use them for all kinds of variations of push-ups without any issues."
2,Very Uncomfortable To Use,I was very disappointed with this product. I found the grips to be very uncomfortable for my hands and wrists. I couldn't do more than a few push-ups with these without my hands aching incessantly. There just isn't enough padding on the grips for these push-up bars.
2,"Cheaply Made, Not Sturdy - Inferior Bars That Slide","I'm disappointed with these push-up bars. From the picture, you can't tell they're cheaply made - lightweight plastic. I used them on a hardwood floor and once was enough. The bottom of each one has rubber pads to keep you from sliding, but they are poorly set and feel flimsy. They're positioned to stick out slightly to provide some traction but once you put your weight on them, they get compressed and become one with the bars. As a result, they can't keep you locked in place. I used them once and already I was concerned they would slip out from under me. I was hoping to replace my old, trusty push-up bars, but not this time."
2,A little disappointed,"I am currently attempting to complete P90X and bought these push-up bars after reading a few reviews. I am disappointed with them in two areas. One, they are not nearly as comfortable as I would have thought. When using them they dig into the heal of my hand. These are the first push-up bars I've ever used, so maybe this is normal, but the handle is not completely round and so has a corner (all be it not a sharp one) that can dig into one's palm. Two, when using them in a wide push-up position, they have rolled on me. The base is not wide enough to adequately stabilize wide push-ups. I don't use them for this particular exercise any more. However, I do use them for standard and military push-ups. It is still nicer to use these than to use the floor. More range of motion and not nearly as much stress on my wrists."
2,Falls short of expectations. . .,"Not the bargain it's cracked up to be. I'm using them, and they'll suffice for now, but I really wish I would have coughed up for the Beachbody Power Stands. These push up bars are small, the incline is very subtle and unfortunately they are not very stable. If your hand/wrists waver slightly, they flip over which is very dangerous and painful. When you're really working hard at a push up, you need more stability than these provide."
3,push-up bars,"They do the job, but they are cheaply made--all plastic frame and the foam padding is very thin."
2,disappointing,"Bought these budget bars, but wish I hadn't. They do OK for regular push ups, but try to go lateral and they will roll out on you -- no lateral stability. The grips don't feel as good as they should."
3,"Work well, fairy comfortable and cheap, but missing parts!","These definitely seem worth it for the price. I noticed they were kind of slipping on my wood floor. It ended up that that one of the push up bars was missing the 3 rubber circles on the bottom. I called Harbinger and their support seemed pretty lame. I was hoping they'd just sent me the rubber pieces and I could pop them in myself. They said I'd have to mail them in at my expense before they'd send a replacement part. I'm going to just go through amazon instead. I would rate these a 4/5, but am giving them a 3 for manufacturer support."
2,It's Made in China,"When you buy Milwaukee you expect it would be American made. While it seems to be a nice drill every time I use it I am looking at the tag that says ""Made in China"""
5,Great Time Saving Product,"Just line your oven or toaster oven with this product and forget about it. It works so you don't have to. Catches crumbs, spills and splatters so you don't have to keep cleaning your oven. Just remove as needed and wash it off, dry and start all over again. Lovely. It lasts FOREVER. Buy them and give as presents for the Holidays. They will thank you after seeing how much cleanup you saved them."
3,Nothing to write home about...,"I expected something a little more substantial, this is literally paper thin. Can't imagine why something this thin cost ~$8...?I was also surprised when it arrived and was black instead of the beige pictured.We'll see how it lasts...."
2,Poor description,"This product is what it is, but the description was not sufficient for me to make the right decision. It is very thin, stiff instead of pliable like I expected. Cannot use it for what I wanted, but may find another use for it."
5,Non-stick oven liner a Time and Energy Saver,The liner fit perfect in my oven and is great in collecting all spills from cooking.It wipes off easy and I don't have to clean my oven now!
3,Good software that needs work,The concept of this software is very good. If you are using raw files or DNG files it works fine. A major flaw in my opinion is that it will not import large JPEG or Tiff files into its Library.It crashes. For me this makes the software useless. I am not able to use this in my workflow until the problem is fixed. So right now the program goes unused.Steve H
1,This printer using a cartridge that can not be refilled,"It is sad to see Canon started join HP and Epson to spend time and money putting chip in the ink cartridge. With the chip in the ink cartridge, you can not refill the ink any more. Canon saying that is their new ""ink notification technology"". I say that is bad for the environment and bad for the consumer.If it is really a innovative technology, Canon should allowing people to reset the chip in the software driver, after the cartrige being refilled. But NO, they joined HP and Espon to force you fill our beatiful land with all these plastic waste,take more money out of your pocket! That is against Japanese priciple that no wasting resouces!Please buy Canon printer with BCI ink tank, not CLI cartrige that preventing people from refilling!"
1,"faulty product, terrible support","Failed after 3 uses. Amazon cust. serv. kept me on the phone for nearly 1/2 hour while agent, i assume, learned how to parse english sentences. After having to ARGUE with this person about whether or not i actually placed this order, finally, i received help -- the 1800 number for canon. Thanks Amazon!"
2,A good idea not carefully thought through,"The Romance Reader deals with important religious issues and the struggle of an oldest child in an old-fashioned household. The quick, undetailed situations that was the plot made the reader lose interest quickly. The idea of a culture clash is evident, but the under-developed characters make this a very disappointing book to read. It had strong meaningful themes that could make a suspenseful, heart breaking story. Unfortunately, it fell too short."
3,readable but not exactly a classic,"From a literary point of view, this was basically a ""teenager complaining about her mean parents"" novel, written at a teenager's level- moderately entertaining to read but not exactly a classic.From the religious point of view, I think it is important to note that the characters in this book are NOT typical of Orthodox Judaism, or even of ""ultra-Orthodox"" Judaism. They are the right wing of the right wing of the right wing."
4,"Piercing Film, Sparse Release","If you're familiar with Criterion you know it's rare that they put out a 'bad' film. Any contention is a matter of personal preference. The few times the label can be faulted are when the special features, generally abundant, come close to none.Apart from a short interview with Michael Redgrave, and a slightly longer one with Mike Figgis, who helmed a contemporary remake of the film, the extra offerings are few.I found it a worthwhile purchase for the film alone, a beautifully understated classic well observed by the other reviewers. But those who buy Criterion releases with high expectations for extra features may find themselves disappointed."
1,ether,The only thing in common with a field theory is ether. Although I support independent publishers in spirit my body and mind are annoyed by the price i spent on this pompous vanity press product.
1,Comment on J. McGovern's comment,"The reader of J. McGovern's comment should be aware that this could be the author's attempt to raise the overall rating of his book. However, judging from most of the previous customer reviews, his literary attempt is still a miserable failure receiving the lowest possible score."
5,Work very well!,I recommend buying this product! I never got to user ovulation tests but I did use the pregnancy tests. I used the pregnancy test the day I was suppose to miss my period and it was positive :) I'm 10 weeks pregnant now :)
2,cheap for a reason,"Good: Order arrived VERY quickly, was well packaged and no issues w/ order.Bad: This brand of OPKs are extremely streaky. The control line and the test line have varying levels of dye within the line. So some parts of the line could be darker than the control, other parts are lighter. A positive should show as dark or darker than the control line but how am I supposed to tell when it's so streaky and varied? I will not buy again. I liked the strips from Early Pregnancy Tests much better:Combo Pack of 20 Ovulation Tests and 5 Early Pregnancy Tests"
2,"Not The Brand As Advertised, Its A Brand Called Wondfo, not earlypregnancytests.com product strips","These are not the brand as advertised. These are wondfo brand tests and these things are tiny as hell!! These are not the brand called [...] brand, these are wondfo brand and i hate these brand cuz Ive used the wondfo brand before. My name is not L. Rhodes either my name is Shannon, i don't know why they have my name as L.Rhodes. Great customer service from us health tests though. I even had a nice man call me and apolgize for the shipping problems i had they even sent me out another set of tests for my troubles. Wonderful seller, crappy product!!"
1,Almost any other book is better than this one,This is satanicaly inspired trash disguised as 'theology' and 'alternative spirituality' the theme is disgusting and I am surprised that there are not more people condemning the publisher and the writer.
2,Not as durable as I thought,"I bought this after reading many articles and reviews about it. It seemed like exactly what I needed. I like the screw on cover as opposed to the normal snap on ones making it harder to lose the cover or the drive itself. The problem with the one I got is that I accidentally dropped in on the floor about 2 weeks after I got it and now the drive is permanently damaged. I cannot access the drive no matter what pc I try it on, even after formatting. I would think that something that is waterproof, fireproof and bulletproof could survive a 3ft drop to a tiled floor. Guess I was wrong. Now it's just a cool looking paperweight. Also be wary, I noticed a few sellers are offering this drive for $60+ which is twice the normal price."
4,Works as advertised ..,This is my fist A/B/Y switch so i went with the least expensive model I could find with good ratings. I use a Martin acoustic and a ukulele in the same sound system. It works great and no noise or loud clicking sounds when switching instruments. I only gave it 4 stars because it only works on battery power. There is no way to power it with a power cord. I almost sent it back because of this .. But I kept it. I used it at a gig and I'm thinking that the battery should last a while not to mention I already have three other things daisy chained to my effects board. SO the battery power my help to cut out hiss and other noise...
2,Fastway - 'Bad Bad Girls' (Capitol),"Originally released in 1990,this was the follow-up to their 'On Target' disc(see my review).I'm sorry,but 'Bad Bad Girls' is just too pop-like for Fastway.This effort is BARELY mediocre,sounds sort of like maybe a third-rate Quiet Riot.It's apparent that by this point,Fastway has clearly run out of steam.They were good while they lasted.For Fastway and maybe Motorhead completists only."
5,The Weirdo is an excellent novel for the science classroom.,"I have used The Weirdo with my eighth grade science students. I found it easy to incorporate environmental issues, ecology, math, language arts and local history/geography lessons using the book. In addition to the academic realm, the book teaches acceptable ways to deal with conflict, as well as how important it is to look past the physical or outward appearances of both people and the environment. It stresses the necessity of being open to educating ourselves on issues before forming opinions. I found the example of honesty in the story (Tom Telford's refusal to alter data to get a particular result) refreshing in light of some situations in our world today. With the trend in education moving more toward interdisciplinary units, I strongly recommend The Weirdo as a resource for the eighth grade classroom teacher."
1,DW6617 is NOT the item pictured!,"The replacement collet shown is either a 1/2"" to 1/4"" replacement collet or a 3/8"" to 1/8"" replacement collet. BEWARE the item you will be sent (DW6617) is a 3/8"" to 1/4"" collet adapter for a DeWalt cutting tool (not a router) and does not match what is shown in the picture."
5,Terrific TV,"I was a little hesitant to buy a brand that isn't advertised heavily, but am completely happy with this terrific TV, especially at the price. Great picture quality, very good sound without add'l speakers, easy on-screen controls, the best designed remote control I have ever seen, lots of expansion features for HDTV and computer connections. The only down side is DirecTV doesn't have a remote code that works with it, so I use 2 remotes. Love the energy saving feature. Very happy with my purchase."
3,L.L. Bean Ultimate book of Fly Fishing,"This book is very well done and has a wealth of good information. Unfortunately it is presented as the Ultimate ""Fly Fishing "" book but a great deal of the book is devoted to Fly Tying not Fly Fishing . Had I know that this much of the book was on Fly tying I would not have bought the book..John A. Kinsfather"
1,Broke First Time Used,The car charger fell apart the first time I used it while evacuating from Hurricane Rita. You can imagine how disappointed I was as I was in the car for 23 hours trying to get to my destination.
2,Disappointed,I was disappointed in this CD. There are two guided meditations and only two songs; 4 tracks only. I did not think it was worth it.
5,If you own only one copyright practice aid . . .,"I used this book to learn Copyright law while in school. I have since found that is the essential guide for practice as well. Not many of my law school text books have made it to my office shelves. . .this book is not only in my office, but it is on my desk whenever an IP issue arises. It is excellent."
3,Ok,To many characters. Rather obvious ending. Did not like the way Rebecca and Leo 's relationship ended.I do enjoy the writing of Ford.
4,Good Reading,I have enjoyed all of the Leo Waterman series. Well written and keeps you guessing. I would recommend this author to friends that enjoy mysteries.
3,The new adventures of Tarzan - Roan Group version.,"Certainly not the best ""digitally remastered"" serial I have ever seen. Video and audio are poor in quality throughout the serial. Having said that the video portion is watchable, and does not bounce around. I suggest wearing a quality headphone for audio clarity. I enjoyed watching the serial itself, as Herman Brix plays a great Tarzan. 5 stars for the serial content. Minus 2 stars for audio/video quality."
2,"Okay, But Not Earth Changing","Maybe it's just because I've been teaching this way my entire life, but I found Felman's memoir pretty useless. As a memoir, it would be okay, but that is not how it is marketed. Her examples are ""hard-won,"" come at the end endless struggles, massive amounts of self-doubt which, to be perfectly honest, are really second nature to anyone who is even a mediocre teacher. What sounded like a really cool idea ends up being a self glorifying mess of nonsense.If you are brand new to teaching, _Never a Dull Moment_ might have some insights (if you are willing to dig for them), however, if you are already making a calling out of teaching, past this one by."
5,Worthy cars,"The monkeys are boring to my son & daughter, but the lion car is, alone, worth the price.Taught my 1 1/2 year daughter to roar!"
2,Not compatible with Thomas!,"My son loves these cars, but they don't fit on his thomas track so he gets frustrated. They are not as good quality as the others. I thought they were made for the thomas line since they say sodor zoo."
1,This software is garbage.,"This software sucks, the commands are not intuitive, the auto formatting obstructs the input of information and the company is utterly worthless when it comes to help and support. Unfortunately this seems to be the standard for software from PTC INC. I had to purchase this software for an intro engineering course, and I hate every single thing about this software. It was like the designers spent years trying to figure out how to make this software the least useful that it could possibly be, and because each version is significantly worse than the last, I wouldn't be surprised if their goal was exactly that. This program is hands down the worst and least powerful computer algebra system offered, falling way behind matlab, maple and mathematica. I only had to pay $39 for this crummy software and that was still way too much. If I ever meet any the people responsible for this turd, i will spit in their faces and shove the cd down their throat."
3,more than you might want to know about stir fry,Step by step how to directions in an easy to follow format that should inspire anyone to get busy in the kitchen.
3,Needs an hour hand,"Mediocre watch. Hard to see the hour hand day, or especially, night. Luminosity has very short life span. Still like Casio products, though."
1,Battery dead in 6 months,"Title says it all- it keep good time for 4 months or so, then started to lose time. stopped completely after 6 months."
3,okay,"only one train makes the giggling noises unlike how it is name and adverertised, however i am very thankful for that after hearing the giggling the one train does... soooo annoying!!!"
3,The book is good for young players,"This book is good for players below 1600.Every players should play masters games.They way these game is annotated,this book is the best.Ok,Many page are wasted with history but i beleive : if you know more you love more.And then there are very few games in the book but each moves are filled with notes.Maybe,after read this book,you can read other books with shorter comments but many games.If you are a beginner buy the book.If you are an average [below 1500] you can buy or not the book.If you are hinger that these,you can skip the book"
5,"Pesto Is the BEST of Aidells, but they Discontinued it!!","This Pesto sausage is THE most versatile meat I've ever used. I used to buy 10-15 packs at a time and keep them in the freezer. Eggs, soups, pasta sauces, and wonderful just plain. They are precooked so all you have to do is warm. Perfect for RV travel. I just ordered more, and was told by the Aidell's rep that they are no longer making the Pesto. Typical....they come up with a winner, and decide to discontinue it!!!!!!! go figure."
5,Great comfort and reassurance for the non devout,"Upon the sudden death of a very close loved one, I found this book in the library, in my search to find out what death is all about. That's really the subject of this book. Holzer, who I believe is now in the great beyond, was an intellectual of the highest class and devoted his life to the study of paranormal psychology. Well written, compelling, enlightening, and not at all new-age, this book was a great comfort to me in understanding death, why we die, how life goes on. The title says it all, he tells you and then shows you through stories how he has arrived at his conclusions. This book was written towards the end of his career. All but the most dogmatically religious and die-hard haters will appreciate and be enlightened by this book."
3,later works by this author more comprehensive,"I absolutely respect Hans Holzer and consider him the groundbreaker of serious paranormal studies, and since I have read a lot of his books, the information and cases cited in this book simply make it obsolete for the new generation of paranormal enthusiists. A very recommended read for the rudimentary level info for the new student of paranormal studies."
2,Great Thin Look with a Cheap Crystal,"I really like the look and feel of these watches, but I have had two where the crystal cracked for no apparent reason after less than two months of owning them. I guess that is why the crystal is not covered under warranty."
2,Another shattered crystal..,"Wore this watch for one week, went to put it on one morning and crystal was shattered - similar to other reviews - mine had a missing piece about the size of a nickel - almost a perfect circle. Great watch with a crystal design flaw. Boo!"
1,Bad smell no improvement,Well I have tried just about everything to help my tendinitis. My acupuncturist suggested this remedy as acupuncture was not helping at all. Why I though a topical ointment was the cure-all I was missing was probably misguided on my part. In any event this stuff smells bad and has a mild tingling sensation. For the $10 I could have gotten 2 tubes of generic Bengay for the same affect.
2,Not Much To It,"The cash register looked like a great idea for my 3 year old. The only thing is that the pieces that pop up when you push a button don't stay up, there is no change with the money, and it cracked after she pushed it over on accident once. I should have thought deeper and known to get one that has a scanner. Neat thing about it is that it has a calculator, but she is too young to appreciate it yet. I will get another one."
2,Great saw with a flaw,"Powerful saw for heavy duty jobsite cutting, but noticed the one I bought didnt plunge cut very smooth (kind of bogged it down. Found that the blade wasnt square with the plate (I wouldve had to set the saw at about 2 degrees to cut square).I exchanged it for a new one, same problem. Checked out the display model at a local home improvement store, same thing.3 strikes , its out"
3,Northern Adventure,"This exciting story takes place in the rugged wilderness of northern Canada into the Arctic Circle. It follows an archetypical American hero, a strong loner who is a man of principle. He befriends an injured wolf, and reconnects with an important member of his own family."
4,A great idea!,"I have been using one of these feather-locs on my DeWalt DW746 tablesaw with great success. The ""feathers"" have just the right amount of stiffness to hold my stock tightly against the fence without leaving scratches. I also love how easily adjustable this tool is. As for downsides - if you use any sort of spray-on saw top protectant (I use T-9), it will make your miter slots a bit slippery and take away from the effectiveness of this tool until you clean and dry the miter slots. However, when the miter slots are clean and oil free this thing holds just fine. Coincidentally, I have the Bench Dog cast iron router table wing on my tablesaw and this featherboard doesn't work nearly as well in that miter slot as it does in my tablesaw slots. Go figure...Anyway, this is a good tool that in my opinion is slightly too expensive. If it were $19.99 or less I would give it five stars!"
3,Good but could be better,"This featherboard does a pretty good job. I use it mostly on a Bosch 4000 Table Saw. The fingers hold the workpiece OK and do not seem prone to breaking. Slight problem: Only one of the locking bolts spreads out the shoe in the miter slot, and it does not grip very well. It takes a lot of tightening to get a grip. To help it along, I glued small bits of sandpaper on the shoe, where it spreads out inside the miter slot. That makes it easier to anchor down without over-tightening the knob."
3,Qualified Good Product,Generally a good product but I find the feathers to be a bit too stiff for the purpose. Also the price is twice what it should be for a simple molded part with a couple of pieces of hardware.
2,Just OK.,"This product is a great idea, but it not as helpful as I thought it would be. It has a very limited range. It is only useful for ripping relatively narrow boards. As a result, I found myself not using it nearly as much as I thought I would. I reverted to using my own shop-made feather board that has much great flexibility."
2,Falls short of a dark chocolate experience.,Looks like they didn't really taste test this product. Nothing in the realm of dark chocolate springs to mind when drinking it. We were disappointed.
1,YOU HAVE TO BE KIDDING,This price is twice what one can buy this product at the store. What gives? Nobody should consider this product at these prices.
5,Best Fat Free Hot Chocolate,I was so excited when I found amazon selling the Nestle Hot Chocolate. We used to purchase it at our local stores but they only carried it seasonally and then this last year they quite carrying it altogether. It was very disappointing. It is a far better product than the Swiss Miss Diet Hot Chocolate. As someone who does Weight Watchers it also works great with my diet as one beverage is no points. Thank you Amazon for carrying this product and Thank you Nestle for continuing to make it.
1,Rich Chocolate Mix,The taste of this product in my opinion is NASTY to say the least.Nestle's should bring back the recently discontinued (Milk Chocolate) flavor 50000 11164Nestle's you BLEW IT by dropping the Milk Chocolate flavor.Not everyone likes coffee or hot chocolate that is so thick or taste like MUD!!!
5,So rich and tasty!,This is one good way to treat yourself for cold winter weather. It is absolutely yummy and so rich! Only 80 calories and 25 fat per envelope too. I wouldn't forget to pick up another box next time for sure cause I'm almost running out of it! :^)
1,You have to be kidding me...,"Why the hell would you pay this much when a grocery store is within a few miles from home, costing much less. Someone please explain."
3,"Good product, price not so hot","If you cannot find this on the grocery shelf, this is a good source. At $1.38 per ounce, it's actually pricier than buying a box of 8 packets at my grocery store, where the price is $1.28 per ounce. Weird."
5,JULIA LOVES THOMAS THE TRAIN,"My granddaughter loves this wooden railway. Now she has added Emily to the set. Make sure when you add to the set that it belongs to the ""wooden railway""."
3,"basic, nicely made, easy to use",ur 3 1/2 year old daughter seemed big on trains and enjoyed the track for as long as she could keep it out before little sister pulled it apart. It was easy for her to assemble herself and equally easy to take apart and store. It's a simple track and doesn't get much play in our house
2,These girls are not nice,"Wow. I can't believe how catty these girls on in this DVD commentary. They talk about a fight that happened between them and the original Girls Next Door, they make fun of Holly's age and laugh and they say that Bridget has a mean side to her. These episodes are not nearly as entertaining as the older seasons."
5,very good tv show want more girls next door season 7.8.9.10 im a big fan of playboy,i have all 5 seasons of the girls next door im waiting for season six to come out on dvd i really enjoyed all 6 of the girls next door seasons. i also have a lot of playboy magazines and bobbleheads i went to hollys peepshow at planet hollywood in las vegas i really loved her show the music was good hollys very pretty in person would go back to see her show again i really enjoyed it
4,The same CD with another title,"It is the same CD also called ""Eu e a brisa"", already rewied by myself in this site.The only diference is that it does not contains the title song, changed for ""Cao Xango"", as it was originally released in vynil in 1966. If you want to know more about Johnny Alf, try the Ruy Castros's book ""Bossa Nova"" wich recently had very good reviews in New York Times."
4,Fury,"Enjoy G.M. Ford's Style, first person. Also, throwing in some words that I need to ""look"" up.He includes some interesting characters, also.Jean Teste"
2,This may be the one,"After using the same belt for twenty-plus years , and keeping up on what waas out there . I decided to replase the ""old warhorse"". What I have now is going to take some getting used to but after a few weeks I am getting useed to it. The quality seems to be there , and the fact all the rivits are stainless will go a long way towards keeping it together. Only thing that bothers me is that the new one seems to have less pockets than the old one. That in itself was was an eye opener. Will write a new revew after six moths , by then I will know if I can get used to it."
2,Still Searching,"I've been in construction for 12 years and am still looking for a tool belt that has what I need. I thought I found it when I purchased the DeWalt D5101. However, the pockets are undersized. Having to work with gloves on, these pockets made it difficult to get fasteners and difficult to house a 35' tape. In addition to being too small, the individual pockets for hand tools seem to sit too high and make tools prone to falling out or getting hung up on things. I hope to find what I need soon."
1,5 K-cups for $50?,"I hope this is some sort of mistake. I want to order this, but being unfamiliar with this packaging, I'm afraid to get ripped off and only get 5 k-cups instead of 5 packs of 24-kcups."
3,Color fringes. A bad sample?,"I recently purchased this lens, after much thought, to replace my 50mm 1.4 lens.Before taking any ""real"" pictures, I made some tests at close range, with My Canon 5D Mark II body, using a tripod, the subject were small and large some objects on a table.I used available light for all the pictures, and for comparison, I also used a Canon 50mm 1.4, and my Canon 24-105mm. L lens, the one I use the most.At every lens opening I was surprised to see that the 1.2 lens showed color fringes (chromatic aberration) on the edges of the items I was photographing. I soon realized that my zoom lens was the ""cleanest"", sharpest of the three lenses, followed by the 1.4 lens, and then the 1.2 lens.So many people have spoken highly of the 50mm. 1.2 lens, I am wondering if my 1.2 lens was just a bad sample, a bad batch, which you could get in any product, even when buying a $200,000 Bentley. For now, I am returning it, and maybe in the near future I will buy another one, with better results."
3,Not an impressive birthday present,"It would be so easy to make this train more birthday impressive and have it do something, but it's just another car."
5,Great for Thomas Fans,I remember watching Thomas the Tank when I was a kid. It was a great show then and it still is. Kids who like the show will love this Thomas the Tank and box car. The car can be decorated with stickers it comes with. Perfect as a birthday present! You can either run these on one of the many Thomas wooden railway sets or just on the floor.
3,Good series about the Vatican and its history,"If there was a 1/2 star rating for me I would give this 3 1/2 stars, but since there isn't then I gave it 3 stars. I'm comfortable with that becasue while it has outstanding and beautiful photography of and around The Vatican, at times it is more for promotional tours than actual history and ""secrets of The Vatican"". Some of the stories of this DVD series are VERY interesting especially about St. Peter ""the 1st Pope"" and how his remains were discovered in the ""grotto"" below the main altar at St. Peter's Basillica in 1948. Other topics are good as well though they take too long and instead describe the walls, flowers, and some non-necessary details. I supppose I was looking for more historical facts about the Vatican then this had. That is okay. It is not a bad series, and it is informative, I was excited when I ordered it and kind of disappointed after viewing it."
2,Amazon shipped a second/blemish,"The book ordered from Amazon came with 7"" long a cut across its face that nearly went through the cover. I think someone is selling seconds as new. Since it is needed and only paperback, its not woth returning to Amazon."
5,Who knew a patchbay could have so many features?,"Excellent unit, very dependable, and feature-packed for a patch bay. The ability to select each channel's configuration via a switch is brilliant and for the price, this unit can't be beat. Most patchbays at this price point require you to disassemble them and swap each individual input board around to change the patching configuration, substantially more of a PITA than just flipping a switch."
3,too much work,"I have no time to clean these tiny little parts! Then it's easy to lose the microscopic bottle brush. It's also annoying b/c it tells you not to shake, but stir the formula. Well, when you have a screaming baby the last thing you want to do is stir a bottle. I was using them here and there if baby was still hungry after breastfeeding. I guess the only good thing about them is they forced me to continue breastfeeding b/c I didn't want to deal with cleaning and assembly all the time. They do work to prevent gas though."
1,Not happy at all with Dr. Brown's!,"My son has been very gassy and not only did these not help the situation, they only made it worse! I made sure the ""even flow"" nipples were level 1 and they flowed to quickly. My son choked on the formula and consistently showed distress when drinking from the bottle. They made for a miserable feeding."
