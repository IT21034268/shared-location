3,bless its heart...At least I'm in good company...,"Princess Margaret,hm? At least I'm in good company. Since I'm black, I'll never be a KKG, either. I read this book, and it was exactly as I expected: bittersweet, and amusing. I found myself calling my mother -- who confirmed that I did indeed have a silver pattern (and did I want to use it for Thanksgiving?), and that I could use the devilled egg platter too, if I wanted. My mother was never call herself a 'Belle' -- 'belles' were the women in whose tea rooms and kitchens my aunts worked in -- but she believed (as I do) in the same strong femininity that is espoused here. I attended a private southern university, too, and got to see a lot of the beauty queen/rush week behavior I read here -- and found a lot of it terribly silly. I feel about this book the way I mostly do about the place I call home: conflicted, but nowhere else (well, maybe the British countryside) would ever do."
4,Just what I was looking for!,I have purchased these shoe at Macy's and JCPenney's but it was a couple years ago. Trying to find them again was difficult because they no longer carried the Piers style. When I saw them on the Amazon web site I was thrilled and I have now ordered 5 pair.. They are just what I was looking for; shoes that are comfortable and at reasonable price.
1,"The seller, Shoe Station sent me two different shoe size of shoes as a pair","The seller, Shoe Station made a big mistake by sending me a wrong shoe size. In the box, a shoe size was 7 and half, the other one was 8. Who can wear two different shoe size as a pair? Two different shoe size cannot be a pair. I think the seller is inconsiderate. It was a gift for my friend. When I heard form her that Shoe Station sent a wrong pair of shoes, I was so embarrassed."
3,Works well. Does not meet the exact description. But is efficient.,"Will probably not have any problem purchasing again. Would like to note that the product received is not exactly as described (quality is fine) different brand, dimensions, etc..."
3,They were as expected,"This was my second purchase from Amazon.com but my first purchase is still sitting in the box because I can't figure out how to return it. I was told that I could return it to Toys R Us but when I did, they said they didn't carry it in the stores."
5,MY K&N #1,I have been looking everywhere for this k&n Well I got it on my truck about three weeks ago. I do notice the change in how it is running much better. But I have a few other things added as well. I am pleased with my pruchase and the price was unreal. What a real value. Great shipping time. Product was as stated. I am very pleased. 100% HAPPY.Updated 1/30/13 it is working very well on my chevy ssr. Better gas mileage.Updated 2/13/2013 I took a drive about 350 miles and the gas mileage was great.
4,Generac 9777 Generator,Met all expectations - a terrific value - order and deliveryprocessed without a hitch - would definitely recommend forpurchase.
5,best generator made,easy to startquiet operationlong runing timesteady voltage no need for a voltage line conditionerprice is right for what you get.
4,fun a many levels,great b/c you can take off the sorting lid and let them drop the shapes in when they are very small and can't possibly get the shapes right on purpose. if you get the other tomy ball party things you'll have billions of balls to drop in this toy too since they are the same size.
5,Really entertaining read,"I was born and grew up in Wichita, and now live out in the sticks near Udall. I loved the stories in this book, and I thought the author did a really great job in telling them.I always looked for stories close by hoping for a chance to investigate them myself. Definitely recommend this for people looking for a really creepy ghost story to get them through the night."
2,Not for me,It's my fault for not learning about the kinds of blues I enjoy. I won't ever listen to this. Most of the songs were torture for me.
5,Amazing,This is an amazing and delicious compilation of the most ancient Rumi works.I truly believe it is well worth owning. ... Great for a gift too :)
1,Pseudo spiritualism,"This is a junk product, a ""murder of culture"" as one review (too) nicely put it. A group of pseudo spiritual characters gathered to stuff even more money into their already fat bank accounts. Madonna? Demi Moore? Topped by Shallow-ak Chopra? Gimme a break...P.S. what the heck was Martin Sheen thinking?"
3,A short note,"My congratulations to the many reciters in this CD, a job well done. However, one has mixed feelings when something written about ""love"" is packaged and abused and mis-used by the Dr. feel- goods for a dollar of the world (The ""Doctors"", in the river of, ""money is good"". By the way ""Dr."" Chopra, Rumi is not from Lebanon as you have claimed (go learn about Persia/Iran, and Persian literature)."
4,Pleasure to read,I got this book along with a few others to allow him to see how people react in certain situations. I hope he finds that it is better to do good than not. I still to this day find it facinating that books can take you to where the story takes place. This book will remain with us for a long time.
2,not Senco's fault,"Received box of staples loose in larger box with piece of unattached wrapping material floating around in there. Staple box was open, several clips of staples missing. Really, Amazon? The 2 stars are for Amazon, not Senco."
5,A Surprise,"I am a big fan of all the bone cds, but bizzy bone's solo cds havent always been the greatest, the best release prior being the beginning and the end. This cd was definitely a surprise, it is a cd listenable from front to back, mr.criminal was a great addition, the only bad thing i can say about this cd is that they reused beats too often"
5,worth every penny,"This performance from David Byrne is near flawless. His band is Damn good. The percussion is really fun and the bass player is as solid as they come while delivery the harmony vocals perfectly by himself. There are some great versions of Talking Heads classics plus some of his best solo work. There is a bad ass string section that really puts the fresh twist on these songs although my only criticism is that they may have been used a little too much but i understand why he would want to use them that much....because they are that good! David Byrne is a national artistic treasure. He makes you think, dance, & want to cry all at the same time."
1,Caffeine junkie cooks a meal.,"It took me a good bit of time to get through this book...i had read others in the series...but this!...Goldy Schulz needs to have a talk with that rude child of hers...and Ms. Davidson needs to fill in some of the blanks....and who in the world uses the word ""pickaninny"" to describe a main character's hair style? Ms. Davidson does! And this character - Goldy - is one caffeine junkie. No wonder it appears as if she is preparing 6000 meals at once. She probably is on enough caffeine to go into orbit! Coffee is wonderful...but i would suspect Goldy has burned out her taste buds by this time. Please start a new series, Ms. Davidson, and let this one go."
5,Excellent Culinary Cozy,"Goldy's catering business has taken off and she's exhausted. She caters an event at an expanding shopping mall and disaster strikes, as it usually does when Goldy is present. The worst part is, her dear young friend Jullian is arrested for murder. Goldy sets out to solve the crime and get Jullian out of jail. This is an especially well-plotted story that moves along at a rapid pace. Never a dull moment. The regular cast of characters are present and as enjoyable as ever. A multitude of nasty suspects gives the reader plenty of opportunities to boo and hiss. As always, many wonderful sounding recipes are included. I made the Spice Of Life Cookies and they turned out great...soft and full of flavor like a good molasses-type cookie. Davidson's books should come with warning labels. Caution: May cause weight gain."
5,Riveting Riddle and Recipes,He who has a rapaciious appetite for the extraordinary in the culinary arts and in a mystery publication will be well satisfied after having read this book.
3,This recipe needs Dr. Spock,"Goldie the Colorado caterer is back - this time investigating strange shenanigans in the land of Shopoholics: the upscale local mall. Diane Mott Davidson's recipes and regular cast are back too - which is both good news and bad news for her devoted fans. Tom, Julian and Marla are great fun. Son Arch needs to go off to college - or the military would be even better! (See the reviewers' consensus here and from the previous installment of this series, ""Sticks and Scones."") His whiney attitude and sense of absolute entitlement due to over-indulgent parenting are getting in the way of the stories - enough to make some of us reluctant to revisit this series. Davidson is so busy trying to deal with this brat that there are loose ends at the end!Dr. Spock - No not Leonard Nimoy's character on Star Trek- the OTHER Spock -Dr. Benjamin Spock -the one who told Boomer's parents how to raise us, would not be amused. ;-)"
4,A new Voice!,"It is so refreshing to finally witness a fresh voice in such a young author! I heard Rick Beaty read in Boston and I was surpisingly impressed in the relationship he has with language. So many poets today have nothing to say, it is nice to read a little beauty, culture and intelligence in the place of nonsense for a change. Cheers to a new VOICE!"
1,XBOX TURBO CONTROLLER,"FIRST OF ALL ON THE ADD SAYS THAT XBOX CONTROLLER THAT'S WHY I ORDER AND I RECEIVED THE CONTROLLER AND WAS ONLY FOR PS AND PS2 NOT ""XBOX"", I HAVE NO USE FOR A PS TURBO CONTROLLER.HORROBLE."
3,History,It was a look into the past teaching of faith. It is truly dry and cerebral to me but would recommend it for the scholarly.
5,incredible recipes,"I love the cake recipes in this book.It has the best chef's cake recipes from restaurants.I can make the best cake at home and eat the whole cake, not just a slice!"
3,Eh...it's OK,"My kids are HUGE Backyardigans fans, and we had watched commercials for this DVD for weeks. I finally gave in and purchased it. We could have easily done without it.The details: 36 minutes long, 21 songs. Each song is only about a minute or two long. They did put the words on the bottom of the screen so parents or little ones that can read can keep up, so that was a nice touch, but otherwise this seems like kind of a goofy DVD. This is partly my fault. It says right on it: ""it is simply a compilation of songs from previous episodes"". I was expecting something ""super cool"" as my son would say, and this just isn't it.If your little one likes to dance around to the Backyardigans songs, which granted are very cute, then this would be a good purchase. I suggest finding it used though, as $17 for 36 minutes of quickie-clips is a bit outrageous in my book."
1,All here are correct: It was not Jefferson,"Please remove this item. Unless, you believe pushing bold-faced lies is acceptable...? I hope not."
1,Bad Form,"This quote is fallaciously attributed to Thomas Jefferson. He said no such thing.I would like to repeat something said by that great philosopher Frederick of Honolulu. He said ""Repeating silly quotes is the highest form of bad form."" Only a liberal nut-job would consider ""dissent....the highest form of patriotism"", not reasoned and rational dissent, just mere dissent. Using that sort of messed-up logic would make all the enemies of my country (the USA), patriots, since they certainly are dissenting. It is a silly saying. Dissent from anyone that so highly regards this absurd and ridiculous motto."
1,distinct taste of mainsteam political correctness,"To start the transfer quality is about zero. It is exactly what it say on cover-celebrity skin and as such the maximum you see are tits and smiles. My guess is woman's smile is why we pay anything otherwise why everything falling apart after in a while? Other problem the producer tells us and shows us their happy family lives after they hit 60th and its not what I wanna know or see. Generally the DVD is suitable for guys under 15 and visible political correctness just turn me off. Off, and out of my life! Another 20 bucks wasted!"
2,Very disappointed,"There is no menu or scene breaks. No way to find a perticular actress. Do not recommend. If you want user friendly version of Famous celebrity nude scenes, get the Citrus Cinema vrsions of 70's and 80's that are out."
2,Fun but Cheap Quality,"I bought these for my 5 year old monster truck lover, he loved painting them and the idea of designing his own monster truck but was very disappointed that they fell apart and broke after not being played with that much. Very cheaply made. I would not recommend this item to anyone."
3,Nephews Christmas,"My nephew has not received this toy yet, so I have no feedback from him or his mother about how well he liked it. However; it is what he asked for so I will assume he likes it very much."
4,Absolutely Wonderful...Squared,"I wrote a review of this some months ago with praise and admiration for this book. I thought that the book would end up on my shelf along with piles of other technical and instructional manuals. However and to my surprise, I've discovered that for the past 4 months this book has been a constant companion. I've turned to it for many small facts that slipped my mind from time to time.The well-worn pages are testimony to a well-read book."
4,Caged Bird,"Buy this entire album for the track, Caged Bird. I guarantee that with each bird you see, whether free or caged, your thoughts will take flight and remember Ms. Lincoln's melodic phrasings."
1,"Get ""That's Him"" & ""It's Magic"" before you get this oddity..","The music is very hard to listen to, Abbey is trying to be a little too artsy here, buy her 1950's classics reissued on CD ""That's Him"" on OJC and ""It's Magic"" also on OJC. Start with those then get into her wierd more recent stuff."
2,A Vietnam Vet You Won't Like,"A well written memoir, an engaging woman's search for self and the father with whom she could never communicate, but this vet has more problems than PTSD, not the least of which are ingnorance, obstinance, unwillingness to learn from mistakes, inability to express love or feelings, and destructive alcolholism. What's fun about reading about this guy, a classic horrific father, and the damage he has wrought in his family?"
2,A Memoir Lacking Insight,"My dad's a Vietnam Vet, too, and so maybe my expectations were too high for this book. The author writes some appealing scenes but she lacks insight into her life. There is a promise of honesty in the kinds of stories she is telling about her family, but a lot of it seemed made up, especially at the end. I was just, like, yea, sure, even if this is true material-- where are the connections I need to see? I feel like this is the life of someone who doesn't understand life very well yet. I didn't like the flipping back and forth between war stories that seemed too crafted and literary, and scenes from the author's life, which were more interesting, but not quite getting to the point, if there was one. Essentially, this isn't a story I believe, though the writing is polished and literary."
2,Out of date and incomplete,"Honestly, this book is pretty poorly made in comparison to the later edition called Dark Ages Vampire. The art is sketchy, and lots of the disciplines are too vague. I could rant on endlessly about it in detail, but it would be much easier just to get the 2nd edition. The only thing I found useful (and yes, I have both versions, and every Vampire book ever made by White Wolf including the exotic ones most will never hear about) in this book that the new edition didn't cover is a price list for weapons and armor, using Resource dots."
4,Good product,"Good quality product, but did not fit the fire pit I bought it for. It was a camp chef 29 LPG."
4,portable generator,"I bought this generator primarily for use with my 29' travel trailer in primitive camping situations, and occasionally for use for home power outages. Primarily my review is related to the initial package and set up. Overall the package was drop shipped without problem and setup was easy. I was however disappointed that the generator DID NOT include a battery as this is and electric start equiped generator. The inclusion of a 25$ battery seems like it should be automatic to me. However the system starts very easily for a 13 horsepower engine manually and runs quiet for such a big engine and really compared to much smaller generators as well.---overall a good buy"
5,Every bit as good as his book Positive Classroom Discipline,"Fredric Jones has done it again. He shows educators outstanding instructional techniques in a clear and detailed fashion. Difficult math concepts that I couldn't get children to master in months, I now can do in weeks. His ideas for helping children are a must read for any educator. This is the best book I've seen on improving instruction in the classroom."
4,Just buy Tools for Teaching by Fred Jones instead,It seems that everything Fred Jones has to say in Positive Classroom Discipline and Positive Classroom Instruction is much better formulated in his newer Tools for Teaching. So I probably wouldn't buy either of the first two books if I had to do it again. Tools for Teaching is GREAT! and it has all of what Jones has researched and put together for his workshops in one place. That's the book to buy instead. Wish I'd had it 20 years ago when I started teaching.
1,"It's sad, so sad","I totally agree with the other one here, this is just terrible, should not be allowed to sell. Elton is the greatest, this is the worst. So sad"
1,"HOW ABOUT, NO?","I was really excited to hear that an Intec monitor was coming out. I really like Intec products, and I think they are a good brand. This little product changed my mind. Okay, lets start. 1)It's friggin' huge! 2) Only a 4"" screen for something this big? Come on! SONY's screen was bigger, and its a smaller set, which brings me to my next point. 3) IT'S 5 POUNDS!!! 5 POUNDS!!! That's the weight of most laptops. Combined, its about 6.5 pounds. SONY's is about, what, a couple of ounces? A pound, maybe? Oh well. I can't make up their mind. They already made this hunk of metal and plastic. It does have a FEW good points. It does have an AV in jack that doesnt require a kookie cable, and it has good sized speakers. But even these good points don't amount to much. It [stinks], no matter how you look at it. Save the money to get a SONY. SONY stands for QUALITY. Spend the extra [money] for an AV cable and toss this crud out the window. You have my word."
3,car adapter problems,My son has enjoyed this when it works. We had to return it as soon as we got it as it would not work in car. Now a month later it does not work again and we have figured out the problem to be the car adapter. Does anyone else have these problems with this particular item?
5,Perfect Gate,"This is the perfect gate for our home. It is easy to open and it closes itself. It is extra wide which we needed at the bottom of our staircase. I would recommend it to anyone needing an easy to use, extra wide gate for any type of opening."
4,POWER!,"Being only minimally eletrical, I installed this unit with ease. My only problem was the reach of the supplied PBX, but I safely worked around that. Last summer I used the generator with extension cords for power outages - a real pain compared to the transfer station. This fall, when the low has been 8, I sleep a bit better knowing that I have easy backup power. I gave my kerosene heaters to my son."
4,Good Overview of Fuel's Opus,"Totally satisfying exhibition of Fuel's work for those like me, finding their music recently, and wanting to hear a cross-section of their best stuff."
4,so far so good!,My hubby works over 60 hours a week and just needed something for his night time job where he is on his feet or driving a lot! He really seems to like how they are supporting his back. It has only been a few days but so far so good! Thanks for the fast shipping as well!
3,Great for young transplants,"This shade house is perfect for protecting a few tender plants from bright sun. It is 48"" long, but the sides slope greatly near the ends, which tends to squish plants taller than 3"". It is very well made, and the collapsing mechanism works very well. It looks like an umbrella when collapsed, very compact and easy to store."
4,"Worth a listen, at least","Before you begin to compare Anastasios new work with his other ""artistic ventures"" (re: Phish) listen to all of his new cd. And don't make judgements off the single, Alive Again. Trey Anastasio finds plenty of album worthy material with his new Latin-funkster friends. Although sometimes a tad excessive and pop influenced, such as Cayman Review and NSTAW, the outfit sounds great and achieves some advanced musicianship. The instrumentals are incredible, with At the Gazebo and Last Tube deserving of special mention. Perhaps the finest cut is Push on 'til the Day, however, a combination of clear Phish influence and Trey's new latin sound. The tune manages to top off an incredile instrumental groove with some of Anastasios finest lyrical verses (""the sun always comes up much too soon"") and a driving, yet brief, chorus. This is a great, laid back album."
2,Boring after about 2 hours of play. Too easy-NOT realistic,"I was really looking forward to trying out this game. I am extremely disappointed. Every single 30 to 50 foot put goes in the hole. Which means I essentialy one put. Now is that realistic? My golf handicap would be a negative 20 and I literally have hit a 58 on 18 holes with this game.It gets extremely boring once you finish the total of 4 courses and play them more than 3 times each. Sure you can switch players with different abilities, but they all essentially have the same stroke but mildly different distances.I would recommend buying a used copy and then reselling it after a week or so when you get bored. In fact, I have one to sell if you want."
1,Nothing cool but the...................,The only cool thing about this game is the box and thats the truth for everyone. Go ahed waste your money if you want. I don't really care
4,A fine biography and a compelling story,"This book traces the unusual and dramatic life of the extraordinary anthropologist Katherine Routledge, who was the first to conduct a scientific field study of the strange and isolated Easter Island, famous for its giant stone statues. The story has all the elements of a major novel, such as unrequited love, exotic places, wars, schooners, spies, rebellion, archaeological mysteries, and much more. On a personal level it is a tribute to the courage and genius of Katherine Routledge who in the end sadly succumbed to mental illness. Her legacy is the profound knowledge we have today of Easter Island and its strange history. Finally, I think that this book would make and excellent subject of a major motion picture!"
4,A Travel Adventure,"Among Stone Giants tells the story of the husband and wife who conducted the first archaeological expedition to Easter Island. The book is three stories in one: the history of a privileged but dysfunctional 19th century British family; an adventure tale of a dangerous journey to a mysterious destination; the account of a difficult scientific expedition. It is also a well-told story, engaging through its well-researched and gracefully presented details, penetrating in its psychological insights into the major characters. A must read for those who want substance to their travel literature."
2,It doesn't always work on CD,"Maybe Barbara is a fine performer, but she isn't a fine singer. What you see on stage isn't what you hear on CD. And I got nothing out of listening to her on this mess of an album. She sounds unsure of herself, there's no conviction in her singing, and there's so much breath coming out of her mouth I was almost expecting a tornado warning. If you've already bought this CD, use it as a coaster. If you haven't, purchase a Nancy LaMott CD off Ebay. Now there's someone who knows how to sing."
5,great toy,"my infant daughter loves pooh and all his friends; she can be crying and I'll play either pooh or one of his singing friends(it also comes in piglet, tiger or eeyore) and she'll stop crying and just stare at them."
2,New Mom,"I bought the Sing 'N' Giggle Pooh and Tigger and the sound is horrible. It sounds very tinny. They are cute, but I would not buy another one because of the sound quality. I'm glad they were on sale."
3,Nice pattern . Arrived Broken,I purchased 3 sets of these dishes. Out of three sets only 2 were not broken all the rest were chipped & cracked. The shipping dept. does a very poor job on packing. I had this experience with another order of dishes same thing happened. Customer service was great but really would not want to deal with this issue in the future.
3,Nabokov's magic Russian shabily treated by a fat fisted hack,"""Insomnia, your stare is dull and ashen. My love forgive my apostasy.""So Vladimir Vladimirovich Nabokov begs forgiveness from his beloved Russian for revealing its secrets, its depths, its magic, to dumb Americans. Magic. Magicians. And here comes Mikhail Afanasevich Bulgakov, all thumbs, stuffing an annoyed rabbit back into a hat; removing him with equal trouble.His magic cloth is polyester and tattered.His characters are stock selections (has he NEVER been to opera, buffa or seria?) And what indelicacy! A red-haired goat-like butcher named for his Azazel paradigm. Tired broom stick, bore of toddlers; multiple realities, the mode of Russia in the twentieth century.Worth reading. Then burning. Then switch to Nabokov, and never leave him."
1,Do not buy this rubbish,"This is the worst electronic item I have ever bought. I have had it for 4 months and I now cannot transfer any music to the Jukebox, despite repeated attempts to resolve the problem with Creative.Do not buy this, save up for something else instead. By the way I only gave it one star because I can't give it no stars !"
3,Hard To Comprehend Due To The Time It Was Written,"Aristotle's Poetics is touted as a ""Must Read Bible"" for writers, and though it's core principles do warrant merit, they are hard to decipher because: they were written so long ago; they reference plays, instruments, even words, that are no longer in use - and sometimes the words are not even translated; they are spelled out with symbols.I read it, and found it difficult to follow, but it is a quick read. At least I can tell people that I read Aristotle. That is definitely a conversation starter."
1,valium please,I need one to get thru this album. BlechI have heard better singing in the shower from my grandma.
5,Beautiful singing,I give this 5 stars. Peisha's beautiful singing and the harmony of the piano makes this a truly great Cd. It has passion and love and warmth. She has a wonderful gift. She has grace and style. Her voice range is outstanding because she has such a huge range. Mel plays with a lot of emotion and grace. I have enjoyed this music and I recommend it highly. I've seen them in person at the Cinnagrill and together they are magic.
3,ok but uninspiring,I keep hoping a ballroom dance CD will have music that really makes me want to dance. Alas I can only add this one to my collection of useful (for the strict-tempo) but uninspring ballroom CDs.
2,Not a good textbook,"I don't see how anyone could approve of this book. I'm taking an udergraduate class in optics and the professor chose this book. It is the worst textbook I have ever had. And everyone else in my class agrees with me. If I don't understand or miss a lecture, there is no way I'm going to get up to speed by reading this book."
2,Picture error,The picture used is not the picture of a rear mount helm. The picture is of a front mount helm. The question is what is being sold. The front mount is usually not as expensive. I would not be able to order with knowing what is being offered.
2,charmed but not impressed,This is a cute little book and gives you some of the cool spells from the show but not quite what i was expecting
4,Lighten UP!,"My son and I have been reading Junie B. for a year now. He loves her. He laughs at her grammar, laughs when she misbehaves. He has NOT, however, picked up her 'bad habits.' I've never had to stop and say ""Now we don't say I hate you"" or ""We don't do things like that, right??"" He already knows these things, and Junie B is not going to take that away from him. I think many of you are not giving your children enough credit. They're smarter than we think they are. They're not going to turn out to be a 'bad seed' simply because they read a Junie B. book. Sure they may be easily influenced, but that's OUR job to teach them right from wrong before they ever pick up a Junie B. book."
1,Bad Influence on Young Daughter,"I've been reading these books with my 4-year-old for the last month. I'm really disturbed by the name calling in the book and the overall bad behavior by Junie B. Jones. The author also assumes that children are stupid. Especially in the book ""Monkey Business"" when Junie B. Jones thinks her mother has given birth to a baby monkey because the grandma describes the newborn as cute as a monkey. Come on! My 4-year-old knows that a statement like that is just an expression and that humans don't give birth to monkeys. And I'm also disturbed by the bad grammar used throughout the book. My daughter keeps asking me why Junie B. Jones is using the wrong words. I also have to keep reminding her that we don't call people ""stupid"" and ""dumb,"" which the main characters seems to do quite often."
1,Horrible for little ones!,"I too am at a loss as to why these books are such a huge hit. My daughter loves them, but as my husband and I were skimming the books we were shocked at the content. And we are not little narrow-minded prudes. I know the books are a big hit, but the title character could not be more of a negative role model in my opinion. Junie. B has a terrible, negative attitude about everything. And the bad words are free flowing (stupid, idiot, dumb, darnit, etc.).Everyone has a different idea of what is appropriate. But there is no question that this is not the kind of garbage we want our children reading.I don't get it!"
5,Good books,My niece is a huge Junie B Jones fan. These books are easy to read and easy for little girls to relate to. They encourage independent reading which is crucial for a good education base.
1,The junk food of children's books,"The Junie B. Jones books I have read are a sad example of children's literature. The grammatical errors are excessive and detract from the stories. The errors would be expected in a child of 2 or 3 years of age but not a 5 or 6 year old. We have three books that my daughter and I have made corrections in but I will not be purchasing any more. There are many other choices in children's literature to satisfy a child's imagination and encourage a love of reading. Stupid is not cute. This junk is pumped out for the masses to gorge on like McDonald's. So enjoy, we've had our fill."
1,It's not just children's behaviors that are a bad example here.,"In a world of sitcoms we have become all too comfortable with sarcasm, biting remarks, and with people being just plain mean. I began to Junie B. Jones with my daughter and stopped after the mother said something sarcastic and insulting to the father. Most people reading this will probably think I overreacted, that's ok. With the divorce rate over 50% for first marriages and over 75% for second marriages, we should all be striving to set REALLY great examples of what a husband and wife relationship is, a healthy one. Not one modled after sitcom characters, but one full of honor and respect!!!"
2,Kids don't talk like this in real life...,"My daughter is in [...] and doesn't talk or act like Junie B. Neither do any of the other first graders I know. While some of her comments are funny, for the most part, I find her offensive. My daughter has a really hard time reading and understanding these books because the grammar is so bad and Junie B doesn't have a linear train of thought when she speaks. Try other series like Cam Jansen, the Littles, etc"
1,Ms. Park tries too hard to sound like a kid,"Being a real kid--I am 8, but my mom is typing--I think Junie B. Jones is not a good book series. Ms. Park tries to sound like a child, but it doesn't work, and she should know that kids know better grammar than words like ""bestest"" and ""runned."" Junie B. is not the kind of girl I would like for a friend. She watches too much TV, is rude to everyone and thinks she's the ""bestest."" I think Junie is not a good representation of today's kids. Do not waste your time on these books."
1,Yuck!,"We made the mistake of bringing Junie B Jones audio books on a recent road trip. Although our 3 and 5 year olds thought they were great, we cringed through the entire book. From the terrible grammar to the atrocious behavior of the main character, I could find little of redeeming value in these books. In fact, my five-year old asked ""Why don't her grownups help her learn to speak properly?""The narrator in the audio books is particularly annoying... I would recommend that you stay away from this series!"
2,fun MoM,"I agree with the Mom on ""bad humor"" learning begins at home and everything we read or say (accept as right) builds our foundation of right and wrong. I really appreciate the review ... stupid is #3 on our family list of inapproiate words we don't use. THANK YOU !!!!"
1,Terrible role model,"Junie B. Jones books are terrible. The insults, the intentionally bad grammar, the mean plots, the poorly behaved kids: all bad role models for children. Common Sense Media goes farther and writes, ""[Junie B. Jones] behaves outrageously, which is the source of the humor, but the author never really lets us know why, which means the reader is usually laughing at her, rather than in sympathy with her."" Junie is obnoxious and similar to real live bratty kids -- not something we should be encouraging.My daughter and I actually really like Pippi Longstocking. She has bad behavior too (like eating a whole cake or cutting her pasta with scissors), but she is funny, kind-hearted, over the top, magical, fantastical and completely made-up.Another book we like a lot is Judy Moody - moody but charming and sympathetic."
4,Recognize,"From a future educator, I found the entire series of Junie B. Jones books entertaining. Apparently the author has done something right for the books to be so popular. In regard to the language and behaviour of Junie, the author is simply trying to portay characteristics and grammar that are unacceptable in society (hence one must practice opposite behavior and grammar). A parent or adult reader who is able to recognize that the author is not trying to imply that the grammar or behaviour is acceptable will be able to differentiate good literature and teach the children what is acceptable. Must read books!!"
2,Stupid and Dumb,"I should have read all of the reviews before ordering this set. We are a very laid back family, but I wince while reading this to my 3 1/2 year old who is generally very polite. She agrees that Junie B. is rude, but I'm not sure she knows this is a joke. Even I am offended by these books.In our house we are far from being sticklers with manners, however, I would be horrified to hear any of this language from another child, nevermind my own daughter.The stories are cute, but would be MUCH better told with more appropriate language. The writing is actually very good--except for Junie B's rotten attitude and language. I actually think it's kind of funny, but not for a child who is still learning about the world.<BR..."
5,This will retain your child's interest!,I have a seven year-old boy who has always been reluctant to read. I decided to try these books as I knew many schools were using them in the first grade. My son absolutely loved them! Even though the main character is a girl she is as mischevious and gets into many interesting situations which my son finds hilarious. This is the first time that my son has actually enjoyed reading on his own and has completed a chapter book. Absolutely wonderful!
1,I won't let my kids read this garbage.,"There are a lot of really nice children's stories out there that are more like true literature than this nonsense. A neighbor lent me one of these books for my daughter and we gave it back before we finished it. I would never let my kids act the way Junie does or speak the way she does. I don't get why people think this is funny, she sets a terrible example and it is NOT okay for kids to act the way she does. I would be horrified if my kids thought the way she does about things."
4,Triggers good conversations regarding the use of nice words,"We purchased this box set for my 6 year old daughter. I read a chapter a night to my 6 and 3 1/2 year old daughters, and they always requested one more chapter. My six year old can read them on her own and I would also find her distracted from getting pajamas on because she just wanted to keep reading to find out what happens next.We do not allow the girls to say ""stupid"" or even ""hate"" in our house, and the book does use this kind of language. After we read together, we talk about how we should always use our nice words with friends and grown ups and that Junie B Jones needs to work on it also.The whole house enjoys how the books are written from the 5 year old perspective and there are lots of laughs coming from my daughters when we read together."
1,Very surprising...,"These books are so popular, I was very surprised to read them with my 5 year-old and have to edit out entire paragraphs. In the Yucky Blucky Fruitcake, Junie actually stands on a table and tells a fellow kindergardener that she could kill her if she dropped the fruitcake on her head. The other girls runs away, Junie is happy, and the parents don't even notice this interaction. Whoa. I'll definitely NEVER buy or read another book in this series."
1,the girl that loves junie B. jones,thire should be moves to go with the books i am a relly huge big fan of junie b jones i THINK THAT THESE BOOK ARE GOOD FOR LIILE KIDS THE BOOK ARE RELLY FUNNY SPESH;E JUNIE BJONES AND THE SPED SEMLL SCHOOL BUS WAS RELLY FUNNY THER RELLY SHOULD BE MOVE ABOUT JENNY B SHE IS A BIG HIT TODAY ALL OVER THE WORLD...
2,Very disappointed,"The first one I ordered arrived cracked in two places and all scuffed up. Customer srvice was very nice, offered to pick up the damaged table and send out another one. Well, the second folding table arrived with one big crack which I am going to return. However, they still haven't picked up the first damaged one, so I now have two damaged tables in my garage waiting for pick up. When I asked the deliveryman who delivered the second table if he was picking up the damaged one, he said he didn't know anything about it. If you noticed the description of the table, it said won't chp or crack like a wooden table. I am going to order a better quality table from a different manufacturer."
2,Not what I expected,"This book is composed of somewhat random stories of events in the British Navy. It is in no way a history. It is not bad, but the title is very misleading."
5,A MUST READ!!!!!!!!,"Words cannot express. Mrs. Jackson is a true romance novelist. She has a way of brining her characters to life. The Ties that Bind is a profound love story. I'm glad to see that there are still some romantics out there. You get tired of seeing books written in such graphic detail. I couldn't put this one down. I have since bought all of Mrs. Jackson's books and I am awaiting new ones. Thank you, Mrs. Jackson!"
2,Incompatible with Windows 7,"They may be showing you the current version box for Chicken Systems Translator Pro, but what I received was version 2.9, build one from 2003 of regular Translator, not Pro. The installer has run-time errors in Windows 7, and the registration dialog is not big enough to enter your information.I had an earlier version of this software and absolutely loved it. The program could translate all of my old Akai and E-MU discs into GigaSampler format! I'm using Kontakt 4 now, and it has support for that too. My only problem is that this CD refuses to install and register in Windows 7. I recommend purchasing this directly from chickensys.com(You can download partially functional demos from [...]"
3,ok ahirt,this shirt is ok dont think it was worth 50 bucks i am often confused on how one company 5xl is another companies 4xl or 3xl. this was too small for me to wear without it being unbottoned and I normally wear a 4xl to 5xl I wish that some of the shirt companies on line would carry more 5xl and 4 xl shirts that are cool and look great.beware of this one if your big guy.oh and you should dry clean this shirt.
3,DEATH SWAP is the original title of PAWS FOR ALARM,"I'll bet the reason the reprint has the title change and a cat featured on the cover is that Ms. Babson has several popular books featuring cats. There is a very nice cat named Esmond, but he doesn't have a big role. The swap in the title refers to a house swap. The adventures of the English family in the American house for the summer may be read in the first book, A TRAIL OF ASHES (reprint title: WHISKERS AND SMOKE). The American family's name is Harper. Nancy Harper, the mother, is our narrator. She has twin children who obviously come from the same mold as Calvin of ""Calvin and Hobbes"" fame. The husband in the English family was recently killed in a car accident. Or was it an accident? Nancy's husband, Arnold, soon starts having a series of near-fatal accidents. Why would anyone want to kill Arnold?"
4,Good Family Entertainment,"I love movies that my whole family can watch (which is getting more and more difficult these days), so I was excited this was on demand at Amazon. This was an entertaining family movie. It's really about the two women who were once very close and then drifted apart coming back together and reminiscing about a special summer when they were girls and the things they did as kids. Let's just say the girls stirred up some trouble that made us laugh. It kept my 6- and 9-year-olds interested and was not too slow or chick-flicky for my husband. When he read the synopsis, he said ""boring!"" but then he really got into it and enjoyed it. As for me, I would definitely recommend it!"
2,OK,"Some parts of this movie are ok, but there is a bizarre segment in the middle that really turned me off."
3,Worked good...when it did work...,"This adapter did what it was supposed to do. But every now and then, it lost connection in the middle of a game forcing me to disconnect, then reconnect it. This occurred maybe once or twice within every hours time. Its good if you refuse to pay $60 for a ps3 controller but eventually...you will lol"
4,Its awesome,this ps2 to ps3 converter is perfect it works for the DDR pads which i use it for and its cheap i reconmend this strongley!!!!!
1,Froze the whole system,i bought this so me and my buddy could play games without me buyin another expensive controller. everytime i plug it into the usb of the system. everything freezes. i mean everything. i have to restart the whole system otherwise. i say don't trust this item. suck up and get a controller and don't be a cheap skate like me.
1,This adapter doesn't work with DDR,I was very unhappy with this controller adapter. I got the impression by reading reviews that it would work with my DDR dance pads and DDR PS2 games on my PS3. It does not. The only controller adapter I have every found that does work has been discontinued by the manufacturer. What a bummer!
2,It truly is ABC. Very basic,"This book is VERY basic and just a guide to surface grandparenting. If you are past this and looking for solutions to issues, it is not very helpful. Becoming a Grandmother and Essential Grandparenting were much more helpful w/ offering solutions for me. I agree that it is a great gift for a first time grandmother before the baby is born, if given by a friend. If given by a daughter or in-law, it could require some real diplomacy in the presentation!"
1,Do not buy this CD!! It is not Vangelis!!!,"If you're wondering why this CD is so cheap, the answer is that it is rubbish!! These tracks are not from the orginal recordings produced by Vangelis himself. They are played by what sounds like an untalented 10 year old plinking out the tunes on a cheap keyboard. The result is so bad that the CD doesn't deserve to bare Vangelis' name! This CD is an utter insult to one of the most brilliant composers of all time and should be avoided at all costs!!"
3,Works just fine,"I ordered the HGW to help fill in the gaps of when I'm not in the mood, but my wife is. After much web research, I find it work as recommended. It's not an over night miracle pill, but you will notice it working when it kicks in. I was taking it for about a week and a half before I felt the difference. It wasn't a ""blow your top off"" type of difference, but enough to for me to say ""heeey""."
3,"Not a lot of real ""secrets""","This is not a bad book for us beauty junkies, but don't expect to be overwhelmed by dozens of true insider ""secrets"". The info in this book is almost like a mash up of tips, tricks, and hints from the various beauty magazines. I have read a lot of what is in the book before, though some was new to me. There are no pictures to go along with their hints and tips, which I would have preferred. It can be hard to replicate some aspects of makeup application when it is only in words and not pictures. A good book for the teenage years."
5,Leaping Lanny is a Jump Above the Average.,"I especially loved the poem ""Just Say No."" This book is a book for all ages with an insight and sensitivity that only a man of intelligence can possess. The subjects are real; the information accurate, and the content above average. I would recommend this book for anyone, not just a wrestling fan, and it makes a great gift for a young reader as well as an older person. If you love poetry - you will love this book."
1,Where's Robert Reed?,How can one have a Brady Bunch book without Robert Reed??? Not onepicture of Mr. Reed or anybody resembling him in the book.
2,Where's the head of the household?,"I wasn't very impressed with the little book for the main reason that RobertReed was excluded. I don't see why he was left out. He was as part of the Brady Bunch as anybody else on the show and if anything, he was known to always be saying ""wise things."" I don't think that it is very nice to have a book or movie and to act like somebody didn't even exist on it. To me, the book didn't seem complete without him. He is one of my favorites!"
5,A high quality product.,"A high quality product. I have no negative comments about it, or complaints to the seller or the product, I am pleased with the purchase. I'm happy because it was exactly what I expected, I love it."
2,Doesn't work on all guitars,"This product does not work well on all guitars. It's OK (not great) on one of my guitars and not the other, where I cannot get the high E string to stop buzzing. For this product I recommend trying at your brick & mortar store using your guitar.I had no problem attaching it to either guitar but I know people who have had problems figuring out how it works."
5,"""Bad Things""",This is a great song. The music and lyrics are perfect for the show. The song sticks in your head. You can't get rid of it. GREAT!
2,It didn't work,"I bought this used and it did not work. I don't believe the guy that sent it was trying to cheat me... and because I gave it as a gift I didn't know that it didn't work for a while. The real reason for buying this was because one of the characters in the movie now owns a cool guest/cowboy/dude ranch off US 395 about 100+/- north of Reno NEV. Spanish Springs Ranch is a GREAT place to get away from all the stuff in one's life. They have some great food and music, a beautiful ranch, cabins, horsesback rides...I met and married the most beautiful woman there... truly magical. STILLShould you ever travel on 395 (about 30 miles north of Susanville) stop in and say ""HI"" to Gary/Bonnie. They are on the east side of the highway. It's really worth a stop."
5,Must Have!,"I'm fortunate to be able to take Stephanie's classes and this dvd is just like being in her class! If you're looking to change your body and get toned, Stephanie is the way to go! There are many fitness experts out there but not all of them are genuine like Stephanie. Not only does she look great, know how to challenge you and get you into shape but she really cares about her students. Thanks Stephanie!! What are you waiting for?? Go buy her dvd!!!"
5,Bought it as a part of Total Body Slimdown DVD for $12.00,"It'a great DVD and you can buy it as a part of Total Body Slimdown DVD here on Amazon for about $12.00 (or about $15.00 in Target). Total Body Slimdown contains Vitorino's other DVD Body Target 60, and 2 more dvds by a different instructor (which I haven't done yet). I always wanted to get this dvd but found it little bit expensive."
2,Absolutely Horrible Audio Transfer,"Love the show, but whoever did the audio transfer on this one needs a new career. Barely got past through the first 5 minutes. It's like they threw it in a busted VHS player."
5,Trekkies Love It,"Contains several of the best shows of the TNG series, which is the best of the several good Star Trek series."
4,Better in Region 2,"Well I love TNG but I won't give another list of my fav episodes. But I will tell you, the packaging of these box sets is much better in the Region 2 version. Also, the region 2 sets are a virtual Rosetta stone with audio tracks in German, English, Spanish, French, and Italian, an astonish 10 languages in subtitles: Danish, German, English, Spanish, French, Italian, Dutch, Norwegian and Swedish. Kind of like a univeral translater, you might say. And to top it all off, even with the declining dollar, the Region 2 sets are cheaper. So if you've got a region-free player, skip the us version and get the R2."
2,Bring back Wesley Crusher,Wesley Crusher was the best character on any Star Trek series. Since his departure TNG hasnt been the same. He was the ultimate SciFi hero.
3,Missing DVD,"Over all, I am satisified with season 6. I would have given it a higher rating but the boxed set I purchased has two DISC 5 in it and no DISC 6."
3,The Collector's Encyclopedia of Hull Pottery(B Roberts),"Though a fairly thorough bibliography of the Hull Pottery organization, this book is way too old(circa 1980!) to accurately depict today's collector market. Perhaps a collector's item now in itself, this book is in dire need of updating and revision. Referring to this edition as an ""Encyclopedia"" is an insult to readers and collector's alike. It also makes no mention of the extremely popular Marcrest ""Daisy and Dot"" line, for which I had hoped to finda complete product listing. I believe Jeff Snyder's ""Decades of Design"" publication will provide me with this important information."
2,Too Dim,"One of the things I was worried about this product before purchasing was that it would be too dim and it is. It barely lights up a feature 3 feet away. it was cheap so you do get what you pay for. If you have full sun, it may work a little better but expect dim illumination from this one."
2,Weak light,Even when placed in full sun it never really puts out enough light to highlight landscape elements as I hoped.
5,Medieval Spectacle,"Bessmertova must have been in her forties when this was recorded and she dances like she's sixteen, the energy and delicacy and her execution are unbelievable. I can only agree with everyone else's raves. A great addition to anyone's library."
3,Beginners book on Falconry,"This book was written in response to numerous inquiries at the pet shop where I worked from 1966 until we started writing it in 1969. It was coauthored by my friend and fellow falconer, Kirby Moore. There were virtually no American books on the sport at the time, only British. We wrote this to inform people that the sport was alive and healthy and also to inform people that these birds needed to be protected. It was written in a very simple language with no major falconry jargon so that anyone could understand it. It is 54 pages long and contains several black and white pictures. Kent Chidester"
1,Crazy Pricing - Wait To Buy !!!,"This initial Love Boat series is doomed to commercial failure with an absolutely absurb pricing of $ 115 !!!Only the biggest stars appearing on this TV series would waste that much money on the DVD's...I would LIKE to purchase this Season 1 and 2 set WHEN, and if, it is realistically priced around $30.Not until then..."
1,Waaaayyyy Over Priced,"I can't think of many TV series where I have paid over $100 for just two seasons. Love Boat is one show I was really looking forward to having on DVD but at this price, looks like I never will."
1,Wanted to get this as a gift for my Dad...,But this is a pretty ridiculous price especially when you consider that you can buy seasons 1 and 2 separately with a total price of around 50 dollars which is still about 30 bucks cheaper than buying this set.
4,MAD!!!!!!!!,"Great album, though choppers rap abilities arent that good, the lyrics will turn you into a psychopath. Plenty of good aussie rappers on the cd, some poms and the deathrapper Necro from the USA. If your looking for some Australian gangsta rap, BUY THIS!"
5,Train case is great when travelling,"This case works so well for transporting a good number of Thomas cars from one place to another. Easy opening latch, beautiful graphics. Love it."
3,The land of Milk and Honey,"Pete Decker is on the case of a missing child, but he finds is much more disturbing then the blood of her PJ's.There is quite a lot of character development on Pete Decker in this novel and also a lot happening with his girlfriend Rina and it detracts from the mystery and tones down the nail biting thriller it could have been.But if you are in to the books for the series it is all worth it.Even though the book wasn't a thrill a minute I still read it in two days as it was relatively fast paced. The characters are deep and the mystery deeper. A very good read."
2,Disappointing,"This film or miniseries is not quite what I expected when I purchased the video. Ava Gardner is definitely not in her best role as the Kadin, Omar Sharif seems bored by just being in this movie, and Art Malik as the rebel is not at all convincing. His perfect british accent makes you wonder why he even returned to his country to start a rebellion. Nancy Travis seems to accept her fate with nonchalance. Sarah Miles, as the wife of a sheik! . Give me a break. Who wrote the screenplay? Well, I purchased this video, watched it once and put it away...."
5,Best season of the series....,"In my opinion, Season 3 is when the Next Generation came into it's own and established it's own identity apart from the original series. Most of the characters have fully developed and come into their own. As enjoyable as her character could be, Dr. Pulaski has been thankfully replaced by Dr. Crusher's return. Pulaski provides memorable moments but she was clearly a ""Bones"" pastiche. As another reviewer has noted, the Second Season ended abruptly and on an uninspiring note. Season 3 hits the ground runnning and doesn't stop. This season contains several of my favorite episodes and establishes several story arcs that will span the next several seasons, such as the Klingon/Worf saga. Standouts: The Defector, The Hunted, The Enemy, Sins of the Father. Seasons 3-5 represent the ""peak"" of the Next Gen in my opinion and you cannot go wrong with any of them."
5,Star Trek Next Generation Season 3 is outstanding,"I love these episodes in Star Trek the Next Generation Season 3. Despite the advance technology of the future they have, they deal with many of the personal and ethical problems we deal with today. That makes each of the stories relevant to today's world.One thing that I do personally disagree with in these stories is that the crew completely ignores the possible of God. I think this is clear in the episode ""Who Watches the Watchers"" where Picard tries to show what disastrous effects believing in God causes. And although I agree a lot of bad has been done in the name of God, I do believe God is the creator and that he is ultimately in control of our lives and the universe.Aside from that difference, I do enjoy the story telling very much and do recommend these DVD videos."
1,Bad video quality,"This video is not properly de-interlaced, it's almost unwatchable. Where's the quality control? Would have never had these problems on Netflix..."
5,Great no how many times seen,"I love this series. I pick up something ""new"" every time I watch an episode. Can't wait to purchase the last two years of the series (I now posess season 1-5). Will then start to work on Voyager and Deep Space Nine."
2,Not a good resource for technical documentation.,"Was really hopeful that the book would help me with layout and design of technical documentation. But it focused more on ads and one-page design documents. It did a thorough job for those types of documents, but not for designing reference documents."
4,Rolie Polie Olie:Rolie Polie Christma,"Rolie Polie Olie is one of the best shows. They are colorful, bright, high spirited and best of all the furnature is alive. How could you go wrong with that? They teach good lessons also."
1,HORRIBLE,it was boring the story line had so much potential but in the end it disappointed me and i cant understand anybody liking such a dull story. the lovemaking left much to be desired. the story itself was unimaginative enough. come on these people are from a different world and they come and visit earth and there are no differences between them and average earthlings??? dont waste your money even if its a cent. borrrow it from some library!!
2,"This book is just ""fair""","A compilation of short stories. Several had endings that were unsatisfactory--kind of ""left me hanging"". Some stories were real ""duds"". Some were very simplistic. A few were fairly good."
5,As painful as growth truly is,"Aubrey finds her way through her pain. Up against a powerful and abusive husband, some days is seems there is no way out for her and Sammy. All these years of waiting for someone to offer a hand, it comes in the form of stranger who instantly feels a connection with Aubrey.True to the art of storytelling, Inglath Cooper gives us another fine piece of work with a nasty villian, a couragous heroine, and the knowledge that love waits for the best parts of life."
4,Good music,"Didn't realize from the description that this is instrumental only. It's all great music, but would have been more festive (afterall, that's what Mardi gras is all about!) with vocals. Still, for the price, a good value."
1,"It's Bad, It's Bad, You Know It!","Trivia buffs, movie buffs, movie trivia buffs. Whatever you like to call yourself, feel free to skip this awesomely boring etude to bad film. The lines are bad, the films are bad, the book is bad, bad, bad. And not in the Michael Jackson sense of the word, either!"
3,Problem on Disk 1 - Brothers episode,"I bought this set at (...) and had a problem with disk one during the episode, Brothers. The picture would freeze and then jump forward in the episode. In order to eliminate the possibility that it was my player, I played the other disks and found the same locations on layer 1 on each, but the others played fine. I exchanged the set for a new one and encountered the exact same problem on disk 1 with the exact same episode. I again played several other disks, finding the same points on the same layer, but had no problem. (...)"
1,Danger Will Robinson!!!!!!,Dr. Zachary Smith is a great character. Nobody on The next generation even comes close!!!!
4,Very organized packaging,Like that they have a booklet inclosed to tell you what each episode is about and that you can pick what chapetr you would like to see.
3,A Bit Better But...,"The picture seems to have improved over the third season and there were (as yet) no sound dips but as I am watching disc 3, episode 86, the colors are all wrong! The skin colour turned to green and the (command) uniforms color went from pinkish to crimson red, which is what happened when I watched those episodes live and tried ajusting the colors so that the uniforms would look more red, at the detriment of ending up with green skinned actors because until I saw the first DVD of ST:TNG I didn't exactly know what was the true color of those uniforms. They are indeed pinkish from the first DVD of season three up until now! Not buying any more ST:TNG DVDs. I gave it a three stars rating, since I gave two to the season 3 box set, but I am so disappointed by the poor quality overall that it should really be a two and a half. My last word on the subject."
5,Great product well designed,Great product and well designed.Would reccomend to anyone in need of or installing a tranny cooler.
3,Zip it up!,"The biggest problem with my order was that I ordered a crate way too big for my GSP. However, if the smaller had suited her, I would have returned it based on the difficulty in zipping the mesh sides and top. The teeth of the zippers didn't line up and the mesh was so tight that it was a struggle to do. Of course, I could have just had the one defective unit - all else seemed sturdy and well-made."
4,Polarizing Filter,Filter is well made and packaged well. Installs easily and rotates with good resistance.
1,Not what you might expect,"This book is NOT a detailed step-by-step guide on how to set up a web server as it's name or summary might suggest. While it provides a good overview on some of the features that make up a web server, the way the material is presented leaves much to be desired. If you don't already have at least some idea of what each of the topics being presented are about, this book will not help you understand them conceptually. In my opinion, this book is poorly written, incomplete, inconsistent, superficial, biased, and repetitive in style, making it almost painful to read. The summary states that it ""is the complete reference book..."" Don't believe it. This book will be in the recycle bin before it finds a permanent place on my bookshelf as a reference guide."
4,Useful and informative publication,"As a relative newcomer to server setups, I found this book to be very helpful, exactly what I needed when starting out as a web server administrator. It is an excellent overview and a good introduction to the type of hardware and software required to run a web server."
1,Sadly misguided,"It is wonderful that the authors are taking on a topic of real importance in the psychotherapy field. What is much less impressive is their approach, which basically harkens back to 30 years ago in the field of therapy research. The authors search for common factors in therapy (which is fine), but at the expense of recognizing the enormous value that evidence-based therapy models play. There is a reason that evidence-based models have taken the field by storm-- that is because they consistently outperform ""treatment as usual"" which is what most clinicians practice (i.e., making it up on the spot, depending on their whims and biases). The authors take a highly one-sided approach-- not valuing the enormous strides that have been made in the field by evidence-based treatments, and the advent of the empirical testing of them."
2,Wizard Unicorn Puzzle,"Wish the title area would have stated this was a puzzle, HUGE oversight. Only a small section towards the bottom states that ""finished puzzle glows in the dark"". I purchased this thinking it was a picture-so it was useless to me as I wont be putting this one together. The description needs to be more clear--AND it should be stating how many pieces because there are ALOT!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Worked great for 4 months,Bought this and was pleased with the way it repaired disc but the motor burned out and doesn't have any booklet on warranty. probably 90 days though. It was made by Phillips and this doesn't say that but the picture is identical and I got it from Amazon for this price. Hope I can find a better one.
1,Disappointing,"I spent a lot of money on this old book expecting to get more information on shadow people. There is nothing really supernatural indicated in these accounts. There are typos and mistypes, etc. The seller is not to blame about the price as it was a very old book and out of print, so the price was probably based because it was a rare book. It was a used book so I did not expect it to be in pristine condition and it's condition was good. However, the content sucked."
5,Reliable!,"I have this same exact model, I purchased it in the summer of 2002, and it is nothing less than the most stable hard drive i have yet found. I have had zero confilicts resulting from fault of my hardrive the whole time I have had it, and belive me I use my computer alllll the time, this is a really good harddive to buy, even though you may think it's cheap for a high quality hard drive, that only makes it better, I think this is the best hard drive to buy that's widely availiable right now!!"
1,Low-quality color Xerox. Don't waste your money.,"Your first clue should be that it the poster is 11x17. This ""company"" basically scanned an old graphic and now they print these ""posters"" themselves with a cheap printer. It's not officially licensed merchandise by any stretch. You'd do better to rent the Criterion DVD, go to Kinkos, scan some of the pics from the pamphlet, and print your own poster."
5,Gorgeous earrings!,"I must have looked at 500 pairs of peridot earrings set in sterling silver before I ordered these. From the picture, I wasn't sure how big or long they would be, but when they came today and I tried them on, they were perfect! (I have small features, and the earrings' size isn't at all overwhelming. The stone setting part hangs about a quarter inch below my earlobes.) The stones are a deep shade of green, not too yellowish, and the backs fit on the posts snugly so I won't have to worry about losing one. They came in an elegant black box with a black bow on the top--a beautiful presentation for a gift."
2,Too EASY,I was a little bummed as I put a picture of the item and the money he(age22) was supposed to buy the gift for himself. He figured it out within 10min. At least he can reuse it for someone younger?
3,cool device for sure but a bit too complicated,cool product and good service from the seller and i know that its not supposed to be to easy to solve but i think it is definitely too hard to solve.
4,Not that hard,"After reading other reviews, I figured that it would take my friend at least 30 minutes to figure it out. Seven minutes later, he had it open. Dumb luck? Maybe, but it was still a little disappointing."
3,Disappointment,"The Bilz Box I ordered came promptly after I ordered it. However, I found that one corner of the box was ""warped"" and would not stay together. Since I wanted to use it right away, I decided not to return it. The box worked properly and was still fun, but I was disappointed that I had to tape the corner together before giving it as a gift."
5,Good stuff,"This stuff is so creamy and moisturizing. Great for a winter face wash. The smell is nice too, light and slightly fruity. Washes off well and leaves no residue. I wear black makeup (mascara, shadow, and eyeliner) and this does a good job removing it without using a makeup remover prior. Now, I'm just patiently waiting for the Earth Science toner to get here in the mail from amazon. Can't wait to try it out!"
4,card game,"Had played this game before and it was fun. found that it is better (and more fun) with more than 4 players, but fun regardless."
4,Good protection for my Nexus 7,I use this whenever I take my Google Nexus 7 outside the house. I put it in my backpack without worrying that my tablet will suffer wear and tear. The soft liner provides cushioning and keeps the screen clean. The size allows a slim case to be left on the device. I'd love to see a real leather version offered.
5,WORKS GREAT!,"Works perfectly. The low price $12 when I bought it was a steal, compared to the RCA similar product at a local hardware store that was $28 and had an annoying power/adapter/cord.This one comes with a straight plug in and no separate transformer .... which is one less than my already overcrowded surge-protectors/Power Strips can handle with all the electronics these days that need the large power converter."
2,Philips rf modulator,"I bought it because I was advised that with the new DTV converter box TV setup you would need the Modulator in the hookup sequence along with a DVD VCR recorder to be able to record and play DVDs and VCRs. After many tries of wiring and re wiring I haven't been able to get the job done. I have given up on my quest and probably have to go Cable.Tha sale and delivery was good, No ComplaintsI'm sure the Modulator in the right circumstance would work OK.David"
1,Fountain City Never Delivered!,"I ordered this item on Dec 11. Fountain City says it was delivered on Dec 17. It is now Feb 6 and I have still not seen the rf mod!!! So I cannot review the item, but I strongly suggest you do NOT do business with Fountain City!"
5,You're My Glory CD by Terry MacCalmon,Terry MacCalmon is a very gifted worship leader; he plays the piano beautifully and sings equally well. I highly recommend his CDs for worship/adoration of the Lord.
3,Could Have Been Better,"I was not overly impressed with this tape. You're instructed to move numerous parts of your body and when I'm trying to relax, I don't want move anything! I tried to listen to this tape in bed and found it distracting when trying to fall asleep. I prefer to work more on relaxing my mind than my body at that time. In addition, I learned that I personally find deep voices more relaxing."
2,ARE YOU NEW TO JEDI MIND TRICKS??? PLEASE READ THIS!!!!!,"I COMPARE JEDI MIND TRICKS' STYLE TO SWOLLEN MEMBERS, NON PHIXION, OR DILATED PEOPLES. IF YOU LIKE THOSE GRAB THIS ONE. OTHERWISE.... FORGET ABOUT IT.NO WU-TANG AFFILIATION. THE STICKER IS A FAKE ATTEMPT FOR PUBLICITY.JEDI MIND TRICKS IS MOSTLY A FAT WHITE RAPPER (WHO SUCKS) AND SOME OTHERS WHO JUST CAN'T QUITE BALANCE OUT THE DIFFERENCE.P.S. I TRIED ONE HUNDRED PERCENT TO LIKE THIS GROUP, AND I ALMOST AUTOMATICALLY LIKE A GROUP THAT ISN'T COMMERCIAL...BUT JEDI MIND TRICKS SUCKS."
5,great album,"After listening to the entire cd all I can say is ""wow"". The dvd is a great little add-on too, you get to see these guys perform live! Great production by Stoupe as always, Vinnie's lyrics are nice and raw, and some pretty sick cuts by Drew Dollars. To any underground rap fan this is a MUST have. Even if you've never heard of these guys, at least give it a chance! People that don't even like this type of music think JMT are dope. Get yours now!"
3,"Okay, nothing special","With Wackies reissues costing $16-$17 for 40 minutes of music, I don't know if there is enough of a wow factor here to warrant paying full price.This is routine dub. Nicely recorded, but missing something. Someone else may come along and have a much greater appreciation of this.Unless you can get really cheap, I would move along and vote with your dollars on other more worthy releases on wackies: Prince Douglas, John Clarke, Meditations, Wayne Jarrett, Sugar Minot, etc,"
5,awesome heater!,This heater is great! Built in the USA! And works awesome! I looked at how small it was when I purchased it and I was like wow that's too small but was I ever wrong! This little heater heats my 21x21 easy.
3,Embodies the true hardships of being a Filipino in America,I haven't read this book but I have read a piece of it in my English class in the Philippines. I myself are one of the people who have experieced what Santos have written. I force no one to read or be bored by this book but being a Filipino gives me a true reason to appreciate my country's talents.
2,Disappointing,"I have loved other books by Wendy Corsi Staub in the past but this one took me for ever to finish. I hate abandonning a book so I persevered. The book is way too long with too many boring descriptions. The end is strange with almost nothing to do with most of the book. It left me with the impression that Corsi Staub did not know where she was going with that one (just as the reader will feel). However, I am not ready on giving up on this author.(just not recommending this piece of work)"
2,Couldn't finish...,"I couldn't finish this book...Not because it was bad really, but because it did nothing to pull me in. I tried twice to pick it back up,then flipped to middle and the end. The ending left alot to be desired also...It partially may have been the characters,who felt empty and shallow. The ""heroine"" was really good at looking the other way, and was too hung up on her bad luck in the past to seem to really enjoy anything, and at the same time took everything for granted. Despite being stuck with a bad ex-husband and a bratty teenager,she was from old money and lived on their own island almost. It was hard to be sympathetic...I wouldn't recommend this..."
2,"Way, way too long for content","I finally finished this book, but was tempted many times to abort it. Nothing happened until the last 25 pages. It was easy to guess who the murderer was---gross descriptions in those scenes. All in all, it was just okay, but really hard to finish."
5,EXCITING! MULTI-SURPRISE ending!,This is one of the most interesting and exciting mysteries I've read in a long time. I plan to order more of her books.
1,"Horrid, horrid book!","It's unusual for me to rate a book this low. But this one definitely deserved it. I was especially disgusted because I took this book on vacation so I hauled it all the way to the beach!1. Way, way too long by at least 150 pages. I couldn't believe I read 475 pages of awful book.2. Way, way too many details about exactly what someone was wearing or fixing to eat, etc.3. Charlotte was oblivious to the real world and Lianna was a brat.4. Crummy, crummy ending which didn't even make any sense. The murderer was someone who was barely in the book at all and who we did not care about; and another someone who seemed to be one of the good ones and turned out to be lying, manipulative, immoral, and dishonorable.I wouldn't even suggest getting this one from the library, it was that bad.I've read two of her books before this one which were both 3's. Unfortunately I still have one more to read. Then I'm done with this author!"
2,Don't like it,"I don't like this book at all, there are only a few good recipes (this is the reason why I'm not giving it one star) but it's too heavy on soy and soy-dairy."
5,remembered TV series,"Item was a gift so I have not seen it. However, I saw the TV series when originally aired. It was exceptional."
4,Great fun,"To begin, Joan Hickson is marvelous as Miss Marple--even better than Margaret Rutherford--no easy task!The three story's in this set are quite good-though I found the first story-""The Body in the Library""-moved along a little too slowly for my taste. No such problem with the other two stories however. ""A Murder is announced"" is the best of the three episodes--in which an announcement of a pending murder is placed in the local newspaper. ""A Pocketfull of Rye"" is also an excellent story--which I especially enjoyed because of Peter Davison--better known as Tristan in ""All Creatures Great and Small"" as well as portraying ""Doctor Who""These storys are great to watch in a group setting--trying to figure out among yourselves ""Who done it"""
3,But is she Miss Marple?,"And, alas!, the inevitable answer is ""No!"" Miss Marple was once and forever created on film by Margaret Rutherford, the massive, triple-chinned Goddess of Crime and Detection, who bore a remarkable resemblance to Agatha Christie! (I once glimpsed the author in the Reading Room of the British Museum.) Miss Hickson is a fine actor and will always have her partisans; but to me she is a bit too ""refined,"" too school-marmish, and reminds me of too many terribly limited Anglican church ladies. Rutherford for me."
4,Verrry pleased,I am a fan of Agatha Christie and Miss Marple is my favorite. I enjoyed the DVD. I received the Miss Marple DVD fast and I am very pleased.
5,Linksys PSUS4 works as advertised,"A number of people rating this product stated it was difficult to install. I found just the opposite. I am running Windows XP, SP3 on my three computers (1 desktop and 2 laptops). My printer is an HP K550. I use automatic update to keep their software up-to-date. From the time I opened the box to the point I was printing from all computers was about 20 minutes. The install CD executed exactly as described in the Quick Install guide. While I will go back and change some parameters to be consistant with naming/numbering in my network, the out of the box install did everything necessary to start printing."
1,Save your money!,This print server would not work with any of my printers (I have 2 Dell's and 2 Hp's). Linksys support was worthless. They were not even able to give me a list of printers that were compatible with this server. Take my advice and spend the extra money for a network ready printer.
1,Linksys Print Server PSUS4,DO Not buy this product...it is not for multifunctional printers. Linksys just launched the WPSM54G at the Las Vegas Electronic Show 2007. Go to Linksys for details....and Google the product
2,Good while it lasts,I have owned two of these products and both worked fine for about a year and then they stopped working. They were easy to set up and easy to use but reliability seems to be poor.
1,Switch good Server Bad,Wouldn't work with Lexmark X1100 Series all in one printer. It appears this unit will not with multi task printers. Switch worked good/
2,DO NOT BUY UNTIL YOU READ THIS,"After calling in a (computer knowledgable) friend to help me install this print server; and spending 6 hours trying to install the Linksys PSUS4, we gave up and called Linksys Service. This unit got two stars for the polite and hard work the service person gave to this situation. After one hour with Mark at Linksys, we were told that this PSUS4 WILL NOT WORK WITH ANY MULTI FUNCTION PRINTER. Linksys gets zero stars for not printing this info on their box, installation papers, or the enclosed CD. Linksys knows this will not work on most multi function printers, the most common today, but will not tell their potential customers. Save yourself a lot of time and DO NOT do what I did, ordered this for a Multi funtion printer. You owe me a beer for this."
4,"PSUS4 GOOD UNIT, CAN BE DIFFICULT TO SETUP","This unit works great. Good buy for the money. I gave it 4 stars because in my situation I use Static IP addresses rather than DHCP Dynamic addresses. The unit is intended for users with DHCP where your system obtains IP addresses auttomatically. There was no written warning or instructions that it won't work with Static IP addresses. I called Linksys tech support and the tech was very helpful. Even though they have no written documentation for Static IP's, he knew how to do it and he worked me through it (which I wrote down all the steps). Most regular home computers use DHCP and would have no problems with this."
1,Piece of Junk,"I have just gone through the same drama that other reviewers have written about. I called ""support"" after failing to get this hunk of junk working with my Lexmark X85 printer. I was floored when he told me that my printer was incompatible with this print server. He asked if I would like him to send me alist of compatible printers. I agreed thinking I would get a link to a long list of printers that DID work with it. Instead this dude starts hand typing printer makes and models in. What a joke! No list anywhere that a consumer can look at, and nothing on the box that indicates you might have problems. I will never by another Linksys product!"
3,Good Start - more documentation required for Mac,"I bought thisdevice hoping i would be able to share my Samsung 1710 printer between a Mac (OSX) and pc. The installation was straightforward for Windows XP and I was able to print from the pc in minutes. However there is very very little in the way of Mac support on the cd, or on Linksys's website.I beleive that i will be able to get the print server to talk on Appletalk eventually, but the process is not clear. For the moment it is working with the pc only."
1,Not compatible,"After hours and hours on the phone with Linksys support, we finally had a rep inform us that this print server IS NOT compatible with Windows 7 or Windows vista. They could rig it so it MIGHT work, but could not assure us that it would work reliably. Save your money, and time, and do not purchase this print server if your computer is running vista or windows 7."
1,printer compatiblity,"We purchased the PSUS4 largely on the reputation of Linksys. There is a major flaw in this product. It only supports a limited number of USB printers. The list of those printers in not published. According to tech support, it is an internal document. Well that does not to the buyer any good while trying to find out if the device will work before buying it. We were using the very common HP 1022 and 1012 printers. Neither is supported. The unit is being sent back."
1,Won't work with Canon MultiPass,"I received this unit and could not get it to work with a Canon Multipass F60. Customer service at Linksys tried for about an hour to talk me through setting it up before admitting that it probably wouldn't work because the printer was a multifunction or ""all-in-one"" model. I was referred to one service rep after another and finally got someone to tell me that this unit WILL DEFINITELY NOT WORK with my particular printer. I appreciated their coming clean about it but I wish they had mentioned that in the production description posted on Amazon.com. I got my money back from TigerDirect.com but I had to pay for shipping which I thought was unfair. You may want to do what Linksys advised me to do after-the-fact, call your printer manufacturer and ask which USB printservers will work with your particular model."
3,should have been better,"I liked a lot the look of this movie, very hyper realistic CGI , lots of action and a resident evil set, the problems with the movie is the flat script and dialog, it looks fantastic but doesnt feel human, it feels more like a video game than a real movie, lacks a good plot well developed, one to rent"
4,Great hd movie!,"Besides the story holding it down a bit the movie looks and sounds amazing! The scenery looks pretty close to real life. Great scenes amazing sound, definite worth renting"
5,Oliver & Company Good Company,Fast shipment and product arrived in good shape. This was for my granddaughter who loves all things Disney and this CD didn't disappoint.
1,Absence of logical and systematic thinking,"The ideas in this book, to my mind, are far too philosophical. TOO FLOWERY; WITHOUT SUBSTANCE. Genius isn't achieved with hyper imagination alone. Though the concept of METAPHORMING would hit the jackpot in a handful of instances, I wouldn't count on its useability in general."
1,ye ch,"people like this make me hate the name ""psychologist"" becuase I am ashamed of any association with this nonsense. Who are the goofs reading this fluffernutter junk?"
4,The rapier wit of B. Hodgson...,"Ms. Hodgson has become a favorite of mine..she has several works in print. Opium..was pretty well done, but I don't think she ever actually tried toking opium. Sad that this illuded her fine mind;she is just reporting facts,however, it is done well. My favorie work of her is: Italy,out of hand;she really comes alive and sparks fly;romantic,cunning and flirtatious.I hope she has read my book.Gypsy Tales:a biker love story.by Gypsyjoe DiPasquale"
5,Such A Good Book,"I started off being critical, what does a man know about writing a romance novel. But a few pages into it and i was hooked. I was being critical as the author is one of my friends.....but how can you be critical with this book.I was so touched by the developing romance through out the book i recommended it to the women i work with.......and they all loved it also.Come on Joe, we want more."
5,Pregnancy Relaxation: A guide to Peaceful Beginnings,"I very much enjoy this CD for many reasons. It addressed completely my need for relaxation. The techniques; guided imagery, music and breathing exercises were excellent. I found the references to my unborn baby comforting and empowering. It seems Dana Schardt is a consumate professional and very passionate about the need for relaxation during pregnancy. She has filled a long standing void.I am ordering a CD for my sister-in-law with the confidence she will benefit from it as I have. Thank you Dana!"
4,The Whole World Over,"Contrary to some of the other reviews, I actually preferred The Whole World Over to The Three Junes. I thought the book was extremely well written, with complex and interesting characters as well as complex and interesting relationships. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who likes character driven novels."
4,Sad that I'm finished!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this novel--it has a rich variety of characters. Especially wonderful was the character of Saga. I'm hoping that Ms. Glass, in continuing her tradition of re-enlisting characters from previous books, will make Saga the main character of her next book. I said 4 stars instead of 5 because of a lingering criticism--I didn't care as much as I felt I should about Greenie and her marriage. I agree with the other reviewers who said she was too selfish to be sympathetic--I thought her reversal (in light of world events) at the end of the novel felt un-earned and came out of nowhere. That said, I couldn't wait to pick this book up before bed every night--not because the story was a page-turner (it's not exciting in that way) but because of Ms. Glass' skillful prose and the way she has of drawing you into her characters' worlds. Brava!"
4,An enjoyable Western enhanced by Cinemascope,Stewart Grainger did not make many westerns but the ones he did make were good. Nicely matched against Rhonda Fleming the story is about the problems with cattle drives. Fine western photography and Burl Ives singing a song in the opening credits.D. Corbitt (Western Movie Buff)
1,re-stating: Do Not Buy This!,"I have experienced everything that everyone else has regarding this memory card. You can't use the PS2 in the vertical position, you have to insert the cd before every game (which gets especially annoying if the game locks up and you need to restart.) You can't transfer files to another card without them being corrupted, and now the card seems to have stopped working so I can add no more saves. Please do not buy this, just get the standard 8mb card and be safe."
4,Cascadian Farms Cinnamon Raisin Granola,"fairly simple and straightforward: tasty, crispy but softens nicely, good with milk & yogurt. can be improved by adding walnuts."
2,Over Generalization,"I found this book extremely generalized and narrow minded.I agree that the fact that eating disorders among minority women should be exposed and written about in order to give those women a voice and a place to turn to for answers. However, the fact remains that the vast majority of eating disorders are suffered by white, middle class young women. Instead of addressing this, calls those who suffer from eating disorders and happen to be white and middle class vain. However when minorities suffer, the disorder is socio-economically created. She also draws generalized conclusions from a study of only 32 women. I feel the book was grossly over-generalized. The only part of the book that I felt was useful, was the fact that it brings the issue of minority eating disorders to the public's attention."
4,Castle is a good show,i watch several different crime dramas and each has it's own unique property. with Castle it has all the elements of a good drama with just the right amount of comedy. i also enjoy the dynamic between the characters.
3,Better than the last season,"Though the 3rd season of the show isn't my favourite the DVD is definitely better than the one of the 2nd Season. There are more extras than previously, I'm glad both with the bloopers and the missing scenes. I have two complaints: first, there are no BD edition, and second I miss the audio commentaries from the main cast very much. In the age of digital distribution buying any kind of solid media is the expression of devotion - ABC should respect these viewers more providing really rich extra content and quality."
5,GREAT SHOW!!,This is one of the best shows on tv! I never watched it until it started on TNT but I have fallen in love with ALL the characters!!!
5,One writer girl,"Beckett and Castle investigate the death of Olympic swimmer, A new mystery writer who is Castle's protege tries to lure Beckett the Muse away, Then Beckett confesses to Castle she is ALWAYS a one writer girl."
5,my husbands man crush,Firefly is my husband's all time favorite show. He was so pleased to find Nathan Fillian in a new show. He especially loved the random references to Firefly. I bought these for him and he is engulfed. Great show with a great story line.
4,"Excellent advice without a ""doomsday"" outlook!","Lots of good suggestions and advice, especially for those of us who don't think very much is going to happen on January 1, 2000. I have revised much of my thinking on the issue though as a result of reading this book, and will start to make SOME preparations. I like CarolJoy's attitude of ""if I am never going to use something like a generator again, I am not going to buy one now"", and that if nothing happens on January 1, then think of it as an adventure with the family in preparedness. Thanks CarolJoy for making the Y2K Crisis seem to be a manageable event, not catastrophic!! I'll go get a camp stove and fuel tomorrow!"
2,Cure for insomnia found,"Cinematographer Sven Nyquist, best known for his work with Ingmar Bergman, delivers some gorgeous visuals for this otherwise unremarkable film. _Siddhartha_ runs a mere eighty minutes (not counting the interminable closing credits), yet feels too long by half. Dull, dull, dull."
3,Marvelous Music and Cinematography,"After a long wait Siddhartha was released on DVD. The first impression after watching this movie was-disappointment. I had read the book numerous times and knew the ups and downs of the story very well. But the stregnth and depths of major chracters was not played with the intensity as was portrayed in the book. Some of the sequences which were brilliantly concieved and told by Hermann Hesse lost its way in the movie. The relationship between Siddhartha and his childhood friend Govinda was shown very superficiously. The character of Vasudeva which is very deep and intense in the book was not taken seriously. The most memorable part of book where Siddharatha meets Buddha was shown in a hurry.Although movie doesnot live to the expectation of one who has read the book but still it has some very positive aspects. Cinematography and locations are extreamly good, the rendering and music of Tagore's poetry is absolutely marvelous."
3,Siddhartha,"Different version of events around Buddha's life, this version has the main actor (Shashi Kapoor), as a Brahman first becoming a Siddhu (holy man), then renouncing it for love, wealth and comfort. Ends up becoming a ferry-man who believes everything returns. Very average caste as per previous comments. Wonderful scenery & singing. Film based on the novel of the same name by Herman Hesse. Wait til you can get movie for $5 special."
2,Beware Non Christian Homeschoolers,"As I am often a harried homeschooler, the title of this book caught my eye. There was nothing on either cover that suggested it was written from a Christian point of view. I absolutely don't think there is anything wrong with being a Christian, but we all weave that into our daily lives (and homeschooling) in differing amounts. This writer is high up on the weaving scale! I don't mind some references to prayer and God, but find it distracting to have it on every page. I just want to get down to the nitty gritty of ""Balancing Your Child's Education With the Rest of Your Life"". A non-Christian person will definitely not like this book."
5,small house but made room,"I live in a very small house with large boys, and this one is worth keeping on the shelf-- leans toward Conservative Christianity, but as a liberal Christian, found it tolerable-- worthy buy -- even as a new book!"
3,a good read,"I was interested as CMCH was very near where we summered as kids. Also the principle lawyer in the story grew up next door to my sister in Philadelphia. I read the book in 2 days. The ending was a little disappointing since they never nailed the guy on criminal charges. He is still practicing in CMCH. I took a ride past ""Sunshine Dentistry"" today. It was great though reading about a product liability lawyer taking a 400K bath. I would like to know if the product liability lawyer sued Thomas since he lied to him, and if the deceased's parents sued Thomas and what was the outcome. I don't think anyone who would read this book would go to him to have teeth worked on. Stranger than fiction would be my comment."
2,The world would have been the same without this book,"Plain and simple showcase of business cards, with no particular attention in selection of shapes/materials, with no letterhead companions.Many business cards are pretty standard, probably you can find some more creative cards on your own desk.However, what do you expect from a business card book? Life keep being beautiful with or without this book...."
3,"Not ""original,"" don't be deceived","I bought this copy of Uno thinking that ""original"" might mean something other than the contemporary graphics. The box did not contain the word ""original"" as advertised here, and a user-uploaded image of Uno is nothing like the one shipped. The cards were smaller than the traditional version of Uno. While I'm happy to have a set of Uno cards, I'm disappointed that it didn't have the original artwork or the original sizes for a product advertised as ""original"" on Amazon. Just be aware.EDIT 12/14/2010: It looks like Amazon has changed the image. This is the image of the game we received. Now you know.EDIT 1/5/2011: It looks like Amazon has changed thei mage back. Sigh."
5,uno rules,I love Uno because it's challenging and fun. It's fun to change the color. And then the other person changes the color with a wild card. And then somebody skips you and and then they reverse it. And it's fun to trick people.
3,High Round,Many redundant moves with only a slight variation. Can get more results doing squats and lunges with a little weight.
5,Happy Camper,"I was very pleasantly surprised by this bra. I am hard to fit (36g). Finding bras that fit and support that aren't ugly is quite the challenge. These bras rock it all the way around. They are sexy, supportive, and true to size. I ordered a second one and my boyfriend is ordering me a couple more. They are affordable and so pretty. Enjoy!"
3,too loose for sizes over G,"I am in the process of losing weight. I am a 36 H normally, but I have been shrinking, so i went with the 38 G considering I could adjust the back band. this is a very dinky bra for a woman with my size chest. it covers well enough, but it has WAY too much give and stretch. I'd have gone with a 34/36 F if i could do it again.the straps are thin. they are also way too stretchy, too. the strap itself slides through the plastic stay, so it's not that adjustable.the other bra my boyfriend bought me was amazing. wish i had another of it, but it was $84 and well, there is a reason. it's AMAZING. this one?underwhelmed."
5,Awesome,"I saw Garrrison a few weeks ago at an instore in Portland and she was awesome. Her new album rocks. So glad she redid ""Superhero."" That was always one of my favorite songs. Standouts include ""Onesided,"" ""Gasoline,"" and of course ""Superhero."" I have her first major album and that rocks, but she has matured so much."
3,The power of design,Images of Australia published this book in 2004 and in 2007 'Vignelli: from A to Z'. Lars Muller published 'The Vignelli Canon' in 2011. There is a similarity between these three books: approximately the same size and a lot of duplication with the images.'Design is One' is no more than a photo and caption sampling of Lella and Massimo's work from 1955 to 2003. The 'A to Z' as the title suggests uses each letter to tie in with some of their work. 'The Vignelli Canon' I thought was the best of the three. The contents are divided into two sections: The Intangibles looks at the intellectual basis of design; The Tangibles provides some basic practical observations.For much more comprehensive look at the Vignelli's work check out Rizzoli's 1990 published 276 pages overview: 'Design: Vignelli'.###LOOK AT SOME INSIDE PAGES by clicking 'customer images' under the cover.
5,HEART CONDITIONS is memorable and magnificent.,"Sara Lewis' characters are so genuine, they live in your imagination long after you've finished the book. This novel made me laugh, and it made me cry. It is real and deep, but a deceptively easy read. I recommend it without reservation!"
5,Nicely Done Double-Reed Christmas,"Smith gives eleven Christmas offerings (actually Psalm 23 is not traditionally considered in this genre). Smith oboe and English horn provide the main instrument, aptly accompanied by string orchestra, harp, keyboard and guitar.These are nice arrangements by Smith's friend James Prigmore, and conducted by Daniel Hege.Especially fond of the ""Away in a Manger"" arrangement, ""O Holy Night"" and the harpsichord with oboe/EH harmonies on ""Good King Wenceslas""."
3,Doom 3,I bought this just for the original Doom. It takes longer to load on Xbox360 VS Xbox.It is just like I remembered it.
5,thrilled with Amazon purchase(s),"got this for gr.son but he had gotten it in the meantime...he kept the one I got from Amazon instead and returned the one he bought..he said my find was by far the ""greatest"", tne most complete and the cleanest of others he had seen...needless to say I am thrilled he was so happy with my purchase and am always happy with all my Amazon finds...everyone should check Amazon first..you will be as happy as I am with their site and service...ladybookie"
5,MST Vol. XX,This set is especially good being that it includes Joel on all 4 DVD's. Joel was the originator and in my opinion way more naturally funny for the series!
3,Good product but the labeler is programmed to use more than necessary and I have not found way around it yet.,Good product but cost and amount used by labeler even if you run many numbers in a row without spaces it uses a fair amount at both ends of the run. If you run one at a time it uses it very fast.
2,No-go area!,"Was very disappointed with this DVD after watching it and I warn people who even think of investing in it.Shnaut is not even a competent Turandot, missing high notes and not even singing some!The ending is not even worth the price of this DVD, give it a miss"
5,The UK Strikes Back,"I recently saw The Storys play at a major open air concert, as the support band. Whilst the atmos was lacking, nevertheless, I was struck by the fantastic harmonies produced in their live act and determined to invest in this, their debut CD.No regrets! As good as I dared hope for. All tracks stand up. Harmonic sounds (both vocal and instrumental) produced through studio production are amazing.The band may well resent the comparison but reflect on the harmonies of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young. Blend this with some of the finest from The Eagles and you're getting somewhere near the impact of this CD.Just great music. Well worth the punt! Enjoy!J.D., Plymouth UK"
3,Cubby Broccoli Biography By Donald Zec,This is a incredible journey in Albert R. Broccoli with his past producers includes his relationship with all of them.The author slam dunked George Lazenby performance..then had a change of heart..due to cubby's talks in his wheelchair...This is abridged edition.
3,"OK as a reference, not as complete or user-friendly as I'd like","I bought this book to help me in some small animal classes and in clinics. It provides some good information and isn't hard to use, but the organization isn't entirely intuitive to me and some of the drugs I've tried to look up aren't included. I'd advise taking a good hard look at a copy before you spend any money on purchasing your own. If I had known exactly what this book was before I bought it, I probably wouldn't have. It has helped out a time or two, but I could probably get the information from other sources without much trouble."
5,excellent!,"Great book and a fun story. I love the string instructions included in the back. My one caveat is that I'd buy an intro to string games type book (anything by Camilla Gryski) to get a better understanding of how to do string games, as the instructions in this book are not always super clear.Overall, a total winner. I'd love to see more string stories from him!"
5,bit information by the famed Herm Sprenger company,"Covers Herm Sprenger philosophy, jaw anatomy, and bit fit. Herm Sprenger bits, stirrups & spurs. Research. 90 pages."
2,not as good as expected...,"vicki iovine seems to have a reputation as being extremely funny, wise, etc. i dont agree. her book has funny moments, but its not that laugh out loud funny, like i was lead to believe it would be. this is definitely not a book to learn about how to raise your toddler. i dont know exactly what it was, but this book just did not captivate me at all."
2,Good Laughs But Poor Editing,"Am I the only one who didn't get a complete book? At first I noticed there was some poor editing - lots of typos. But then after page 180, where page 181 should be (Sleep chapter), it goes back to page 117 (Discipline chapter that I already read). It continues to repeat pages 117 to 180 (a whole 63 pages duplicated!), then picks up again on page 245 in the middle of the School Days chapter that I don't have the beginning of. I'm completely missing pages 181-245 (67 pages).Other than that, good for a few laughs and a handful of ideas."
4,Thank you for making me feel normal!,"I love Vicki's books, her sense of humour and sometimes outrageous comments help me feel sane in this otherwise insane parenting ride. If you're looking for the politically correct, always attached parenting book...please save yourself the bother, you'll only get hot under the collar! If, on the other hand, you struggle to do your best, have a load of parent baggage left over from your parents, feel life has got to be more amusing than it currently is...then read and enjoy!"
2,like working a puzzle.,"The item will do what it is supposed to do (restrict the stride, thus forcing more emphasis on using torso rotation and the good things in a swing). However, you have to figure out how it works as you just get the ankle cuff and a strap. Instructions ? You don't need no stinking instructions. So you don't get any."
1,Do not waste your money,"I read this book because I had to: I was reviewing it for The Edmonton Journal. My conclusion is simple and straightforward: while beautiful, this book is so filled with glaring mistakes, howlers and omissions, its authors and editors should be ashamed of themselves. In fact, if it were possible, I would give this volume no stars at all: the first thing a book on history must have is its facts right."
5,If You like the Matrix,"This book nicely filled in some background that was needed for the Matrix in Shadowrun. I felt that it was well thought out, and would be an excellent addition to anyone's Shadowrun game. For those of you who don't believe that Decker's can integrate into a normal game all that well, I beg to differ. This book can help."
5,Jay Joe Jeans and the Jelly Beans,"My son loves it and thats all it takes to make me happy. As an adult, I also groove on some of the tunes. The ""J"" Song (aka Joe Jeans and the Jelly Beans) is especailly rockin. Only complaint is that its not long enough (its only 30 min)"
2,there are better videos to teach the ABCs,"While this video does have catchy songs, i did not like it that much. So far my 3 year old daughter has not learned the alphabet from it, although she watches it very often. This video spends too much time explaining why the bear wants to learn the alphabet and not enough time actually learning the alphabet. The video is 30 minutes long and i guess they only spend 15 minutes actually learning the ABCs. Although I have to admit the children enjoy it very much, for the catchy songs and the familiar characters.I suggest Dr. Suess's ABCs. My 4 year old learned the whole alphabet from watching it just a few times. I also like that it mimics the book. My son is thrilled that he can read the Dr. Seuss's ABCs book."
1,GARBAGE!,The dvd teaches children to pronounce words wrong. One of the characters has a pronunciation problem and is pronouncing words wrong. If you want your child to be pronouncing words wrong then buy it. Shame on sesame street. I thought this dvd was going to teach my children better pronunciation.
2,"A nice video, but not a good alphabet video","We bought this wanting a video that reviewed all of the letters in a way that would help our son learn the alphabet. The emphasis seems to be more on singing the abc song (which most kids learn as a song way before they can recognize a letter), than learning the letters. Only some of the letters are reviewed, and in some cases only the lower case letter is presented. If you have access to the show, there's no need to purchase this video. There's nothing wrong with the video -- it the usual good Sesame Street -- but it's not a good alphabet video."
3,It's not the best.....,"I bought this for my son with 2 other Sesame Videos. Out of the 3, this one is his least favorite (and mine). It just doesn't hold his interest for some reason. I wish I would have chosen a different one."
5,Sesame Street - Do the Alphabet,"The Sesame Street DVDs: The Best of Elmo & Elmopalooza were kind of true, and continues with DO THE ALPHABET, When Baby Bear has trouble remembering his letters, he goes to the one bird in the world who can help him. Big Bird's amaing learning ""method"" which has songs featuring Do The Alphabet, D (Dee Dee Dee), J Friends, Alphabet Songs ft. Billy Joel, T Dance, the Boogie Woogie Piggies, Alphabet Blues and Alphabet Jungle Song. and features games and special surprises, makes learning the letters as easy as A B C. It's 26 times the fun when you learn the alphabet with Big Bird and friends in 123 Sesame Street!"
3,"content great, but sound is awful","What is not to love about Sesame Street? It's a typical wonderful Sesame Street Production. However, I was very disappointed about the sound quality. I have to turn the TV way up and there sounds like there is a fuzzy hum. Very annoying to me, but my daughter is mesmorized by the content, so I doubt she even notices."
5,excellent - my 22 month old now can say the alphabet,Songs are good. Billy Joel appears sings the ABC song
2,Annoying,"The ""Big Bird Method"" is annoying. Baby Bear is really annoying. They present the letters in a kind of random way, and I don't really like that. Baby Bear keeps trying to recite the entire alphabet and gets hung up somewhere, and I think it may be confusing to kids."
2,not a good introduction to the alphabet,"my twin boys hated this video - it was boring and on top of that, the letters that they DID learn were never pronounced correctly! they ended up learning the alphabet from the leapfrog letter factory."
5,I'd vote for it twice!!!!!,"I would give this video 10 stars if I could-it is the most wonderful of all the S.S videos I have bought(and I have about 20) The characters are incredibly adorable, and make the process of learning the alphabet fun, not just a task for kids.Unlike a few of the other reviewers who think Baby Bear and his ""lisp"" should not have been the focus, are being ridiculous-there are alot of kids out there with speach impediments who talk just like Baby Bear or even worse-I know of 3 in my daughters Pre-k class. Sesame Street shows kids in wheelchairs and kids with Down Syndrome on the show, I guess they should not be on the show either????So, I think he is a welcome addition to the video. Check your attitudes at the remote before playing the video for your kids if you feel that way-it may be annoying to adults-but it is what the kids can relate to and understand that matters."
4,Survival in the jungle,"""Five Came Back"" was an entertaining grade B 1939 production featuring a 27 year old Lucille Ball in an expanded role for her as gal of questionable repute Peggy Nolan. Ball was among a group of 12 passengers aboard an airplane flying from California by way of Mexico to Panama City.During a severe tropical storm the pilot played by Chester Morris and co-pilot played by Kent Smith are forced to crash land in the remote Central American jungle. The group are compelled to cooperate to survive the rigors of the environment and to repair the plane to fly it out of it's confinement. The group including C. Aubrey Smith as a professor and Joseph Calleia as a prisoner escorted by malcontent detective John Carradine help make life tolerable.When repairs are completed, the plane is too damaged to manage to fly with a full payload. Only five passengers will be able to escape out of the jungle just as the unseen natives brandishing poison darts are closing in. But who will be chosen?"
2,Depresses me,"Richards Simmons diet is far to hard to do. He claims it is easy but I have not been able to do it because I feel hungry all the time. I think it is sad that he believes people have to eat this way in order to lose weight. No one can live hungry all their life and when I saw he has a book called ""Still hungry after all these years"" I knew it would never work for me.Still Hungry After All These Years: My StorySo I became a little depressed by this and have gone in search of help else where . Good luck to you if you bought this book, hope it works for you."
3,fun pictures but not fabulous recipies.,"My kids like to look at the pictures in this cook book, but I don't love the recipies. It is just OK."
1,This Video is UNWATCHABLE!,"Save your money MMA fans, despite some great fights this dvd is unwatchable! It did not convert well from the european PAL to US format(ntsc). The result is about 4 frame per second and a nasty wobble. After about a minute my eyes hurt and after 5 I had a headache and shut it off. I am surprised EliteXC would release something of this quality."
5,Contents:,"Blind Love and Other Stories by V.S. PritchettMr. Pritchett's third collection of short fiction. His works have been compared by reviewers to Evelyn Waugh for their wit, to Chekhov for their shrewdness, to Fielding for their comic exuberance, and to Dickens for the authentic peculiarity of their characters.Short stories are:Blind LoveThe Nest BuilderA Debt of HonorThe Cage BirdsThe SkeletonThe SpeechThe LiarsOur Oldest FriendThe HoneymoonThe Chain-Smoker"
5,My son loves it,"My 3 year old is very into puzzles, so we got this for him for Christmas. He works it ALL the time, it's very durable (often we'll leave it on the floor for him to play with later and it holds up to him walking on it). Even after working it dozens of times, he still comes back to it, the image is stunning!"
4,Beautiful puzzle for teaching sea creatures,"My eighteen-month-old son and I love pouring over the beautiful scene in this puzzle. He points to the different creatures and has his favorites, such as the clownfish (thanks to Nemo) and the sharks. We've had this puzzle for about one month, and he is just learning to put the pieces together with some prompting. I think we will enjoy this toy for many more years. It is just as attractive to adults as toddlers."
5,So much fun!,"My 3 1/2 yr old LOVES this puzzle. He even stays in his room after ""quiet time"" is over to complete the puzzle! Quite durable, just hard enough to be challenging. Great price. I'm going back to buy the Dinosaur Puzzle!"
3,I wished I could have seen it first,"This was the first cookbook I bought in a long time without seeing it. I was very disappointed. I don't know....I guess I was looking for something else. I really LOVE the ""Shake Awake Smoothie!"" I have that every morning. Nothing else has jumped out and said, ""MAKE ME!"" I wouldn't buy this book again."
3,God Will Make a Way: The Best of Don Moen,"Bought this item because of a friend's recommendation. Personally, I think the songs are great, especially ""God will make a way"" and ""Give thanks"" but somehow it's the ""live"" part which I do not really like. Prefer the songs to just flow smoothly from one to another."
4,Collection of SOME of his best,I knew all of the songs on this cd before I bought it but there were some I hadn't heard for as long as 5 or 6 years and I longed to hear them again rather than look for the individual cds. This collection is wonderful but there are still so many songs that could have been added and too many recent songs.
1,Disappointed,I installed my camera on a 2005 full size pickup truck hoping it would help me to see behind my truck. Unfortunately the interferance (black horizontal lines) on the monitor is so bad it's difficult to really see what you are trying to view. It is only 12' from the camera to the monitor. Perhaps if you spent the extra money and purchased the hard wire cable it would become acceptable.
3,Works ok,"Works ok.We have two of them, on truck and van.the one on the van stopped working after about two year. (Water fogged up the camera)Same thing happened to my truck. now the picture is foggy.However, when it was new, it worked well. They need to have a better gasket for the camera on the license plate. Also, the sun seems to yellow and spider crack the rear camera lense."
1,Great Toy Greedy Retailer Buy for $34,"We bought this truck years ago for about $20. It is still ticking after 4 years staying outside in the Florida sun, rain, storms, and my son. We are adding to the collection this year however this very truck has a suggested retail of $29 from Hasbro and is available at your local Toy R us for $34! Shame on the resellers selling through Amazon! THIEVES!"
5,Tonka truck mighty and tough,"My grandchildren ages 3 and 1 love this dump truck. It is big enough for one child to sit in it while another child pushes it around. Considering the usual rough and tumble of running around like mad while pushing a ""mighty dump truck"" with another child sitting in it, I can definitely vouch for its toughnest. The kids may have a few scratches but not the truck."
5,Don't pay more than $35...you can get it from Toy's-R-Us or KMart for $30!!!,"This is a great toy, but don't buy from any retailer asking more than $35.We found them at Toy's-R-Us and K-Mart for $30 - $35!!!!-----------------This is by far one of my son's favorite toys. We originally got it for him when he was almost 2. He is now almost 5 and loves playing with it more than ever.At his pre-school this is the most popular toy on the playground. There are on 3 or 4 and almost all the kids (boys and girls) rush to get one.It's rugged and well built. Although it has been left in the elements (rain, sun, hail) for almost 3 years now, it has not rusted, faded, cracked, or broken.We are so impressed with this truck that we have decided to buy several a Christmas gifts."
1,Getting teeth pulled more fun than this!,"In all my years as an Amazon customer, I've never written a review before. This stinker of a movie changed all that. STAY AWAY!! The cover of this DVD, which depicts dragons attacking a castle with the text ""In the dark ages, when dragons ruled the skies, one knight was the last hope"" is a bunch of cowpucky!! The movie is actually centered around an English or New Zealand television series of the same name. The acting was horrible, the special effects lame and, all in all, this is just a horrible waste of even $10."
1,I make all my friends watch it.,"This is my most prized DVD, for the simple reason that I know it will not be possible for me to find any form of entertainment that is any worse.I've started to enjoy inflicting it on my friends, saying ""no wait- it's getting to the good part"" just to keep them watching and then laughing when it gets to the end that it still was bad.Basically, it's just like Hercules, but Ivanhoe instead, British, and has worse special effects.I think everyone should own a copy, just so that they can watch something bad, then say ""at least it wasn't as bad as Darkest Knight."""
4,pretty useful,"I first bought this as a half joke, thinking that it might be fun to read some stupid suggestions on how to be like Bond. But to my pleasant surprise, the information given by Paul Kyriazi are quite applicable to real life. In it he gives advice on women, jobs, cars, clothing, vacations from a Bond perspective. My favorite chapters are on the bond personality and appearance. Its not the image that your used to thinking when you imagine Bond. The chapters are short, easy to read, and able to illustrate its points clearly. Paul's writing style is friendly and a little humorous. Overall, definately a nice book to read, at least once."
1,wrong order,"Well, it was the wrong order. You should have my note that went thru costomer service because you responded by giving me a credit back to my account in the form of my gift card. My order was ""The Dollmaker"" with Jane Fonda."
1,disappointed,"I was disappointed in the length of the songs, the best part of my favorite songs were cut short. Always go for the original of anything! You will not be disappointed.Thanks"
3,Senseless details,"I liked the book and was intrigued by the story, though frequently I was bored by useless details, so I would skim entire paragraphs. The reader must suspend reality of the rigors of med school and all associated costs and the demands of raising children. It is a page turner, but it is also grusome."
3,lover96,"I had no idea what i was getting into when i read this book, and yes the book took me a bit more trys to get into it because im so much younger than the Laura, but as soon as i got into the first few chapters i didn't want to put the book down. You get to know Laura for more than what you think she is, there are so many unexpected things that happen in this book, and as soon as you hit the first twist you wont want to put it down. It was a great book, and i loved it."
3,Error in filling order,"I thought I was ordering a map of the US, but instead received a world map. I was naturally disappointed as this was a gift to my grandson. It may have been my fault, but I thought I had stayed with the US selection throughout the ordering procedure. I will be more careful in the future."
5,Excellent educational video full of great songs and visuals,"This video is one of the best I have seen from Barney. Great stage production which manages to keep the attention of the very young audiences it is intended for, although it even makes the adults want to keep watching to. My daughter loves Barney and all his friends and has learned quite a bit from Barney."
2,From a former student,"She has alot of wonderful ideas. If it is a new concept for you to have play and joy in your marriage, pick up this book.She is the pide piper .The ride with her is a blast.But reader be warned of what is behind her teachings.She is simplistic and even cruel.She has no respect for anyone who disagrees with her.She puts down feminism,therapy,medication and 12 step programs. In her view,addiction,abuse,even depression is a choice.Her worshiping followers hide the fact that they get help from other sources than her,for fear of reproachment.And if you disagree with her,you are called a loser.And by the way,she is getting a divorce."
1,A machine that doesn't work,"I bought this machine according to the link given on the site called Bakingbites - the one I like very very much. But unfortunately it doesn't work. It has a problem on the stir paddle attachment. t's compressor is ok but the motor top is out of order. The seller preferred to send a new motor top but to a friend of mine who lives in US as they can't ship outside US. Now I am waiting my friend coming home from her holiday then we will give the address, then hope the procedure will begin and nearly the summer is ending.Isn't it tragicomic?Dr. Nese SavranTurkiye"
3,My kid loved it,"It is great, but I think there should be more episodes. It lasted very little while and my kid wanted other chapters"
5,Excelente selecion!,Esta colección de varios artistas es excelente! Artistas originales con las canciones originales. Tal y como debe de ser. 100% recomendado para aquellos que aprecian la musica del recuerdo! ~DJ Lupe Ayala
3,Okay,"I think this is a fine music/light show, however, I only wish it would stay on longer. You have to turn a dial several times (crank) for the music box and I often over crank it and it make a bad sound (like I went to far). The music goes for about 5-7 minutes and then just shuts off. I just wish it went for about 15 minutes and no cranking. Otherwise the light is nice when it is on. My son enjoys it enough."
2,barely OK light show,"i could live with this toy's need for wall proximity in order to see the visuals because no matter what, my baby enjoys the spinning light orb it when i place it directly in her crib. however the amount of time this runs - 3-4 minutes, NOT even the 5 minutes it claims - and the loud POP everytime i accidentally over crank it, make this toy not very practical. it doesn't last long enough to soothe my baby (i bought it when she was 2 months and she is now 6.5 months - still a problem) and the inevitable POP sound actually disrupts any relaxation she'd been able to achieve. but really, you don't want to put it in the crib anyway. i agree with the customer who said you'd need to put it on a wall shelf right right next to the baby's crib, and even then the visuals would be partially blocked, so there isn't much to say for this toy. OH also the first one bought was defective, it only would run about 15 seconds."
1,Unusable Product,"The cotton cover on the tabletop ironing board I use everyday has become stained and frayed, so I thought I'd be clever and buy a replacement cover instead of buying a whole new board. What a mistake. After wrestling with the Household Essentials Replacement Pad & Cover for close to an hour, I just gave up. There was absolutely no way that cover was going to fit at all, much less properly. I tried from the top, from the bottom, from the sides. I tried stretching the tightly made cover to buy some extra 'give,' all to no avail. The product is useless and headed for the trash. By the way, the dimensions that are on the package (fits...) are exactly the measurements of the mini-board I have. Save yourself some money and fruitless exertion, buy a different product"
5,GREAT family fun!,"My family and I played this game often when I was young, and now I play with my mom, brother, his wife, and our oldest daughters! This game not only helps teach young ones to count backwards from 15 and to think critically and strategically, it is great fun for them to catch grown-ups making an error (it happens--the adults are chatting and enjoying watching the kids!)This game accomodates from two to eight players, so the more the merrier.......have fun!"
1,Just Buy Decks of Cards,"We play the same game and call it Peanuts, we just buy decks of cards with different designs on them and score by who has the most cards played after 1 person goes out.Purchasing your own decks of cards are also more durable and you can replace each deck as needed - not the whole game."
4,gift,I bought the card as a gift. They were well recieved. Other than that I can tell you nothing else.
5,Flinch Brings Back Memories,Flinch is still a great family game even though there is no technology involved. Playing it with my grandchildren is as much fun as it was with my children 30 years ago. It is educational (learning numbers sequences forward and backward) for a fairly broad range of ages and it is simple but challenging.
5,Great change of pace,"My fiance and I have enjoyed this game. It made a great change of pace from other card/board games we played. It's easy to learn, and there is a good bit of strategy. I will note that you have to work on compromise with this game, which is a good thing to practice."
2,"Helpful, but outdated","This is a very helpful book, complete and well-written with a sense of humor. However, it is not significantly different than the 2002 Edition. There has been no updating to speak of. The most telling fault is the lack of information on the new B+ motorhomes on the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter Chassis. The fastest growing category of RV's and not a bit of information on this important development."
3,Attempts at Humor annoying,This book has lots of great information....but it the writing style goes overboard in its attempts to be funny. The book would be half its size if you cut out the silliness.
4,Somewhat more serious than typical ABC Afterschool Special fare,"Probably the only thing Lorenzo Lamas has done that I was able to take seriously, Takedown is a solid portrayal of a lower working-class teen trying to balance attending high-school with the need to work in order to help support his family. Maureen McCormick plays a classmate who Lamas hopes to...er...'take down'(hee hee). No, actually it's a bittersweet movie about growing up among the have-nots, but finding that what you need was within yourself all along (or some Hallmark card-inspired nonsense like that). Might as well purchase it on VHS, since the likelihood of it ever getting updates to dvd is essentially nil."
2,Ryan T,"this kindle book is not well adapted. For example, the pages number are still there (a lot of time it's in the middle of the text) and there's a missing exercise chart. I haven't finish reading this but felt cheated when there's no exercise chart."
2,Not really a Sherlock Holmes story...,Don't buy this if you are expecting a detective story featuring Sherlock Holmes. It is an adventure story with Allan Quartermain as the central character. The story was too convoluted for my taste and the ending was not satisfying.
1,It's totally a waste,"I really regreted not to read other reviews early.I paid $50 for ityesterday with high expection. But it thoroughly disappointed me.The scope movement is jerky, lots of time you can never focus onyour target. And you have to adjust your TV to very uncomfortablebrightness to make it work. It's much much worse than the originalcontroller of xbox. What a waste!!! I am going to return it today!If they don't allow me to return, I will put it on ebay to sell toanyone paying more than 10$."
4,G5 Montec,"These may be small, but they pack a big punch. Ive killed four deer this season with the same broadhead. And not one went past 60 yards. This is a great product."
3,Great reference but grammer and correctness needs work.,This book is a great reference. I think that it is geared more towards the counter-forensics rather than forensic. That did not change my mind on how great a reference it is. This book shows me where to look and how to obtain the information I want.The links are another story. I understand that some links change but there are a lot of grammatical mistakes and link mispell errors. I think an errata needs to accompany this book - just a suggestion.
1,don't buy it,own an apple hi fi and love it. never had any kind of problem. bought 2 of my daughters bose sound docks and love them no problems. bought one of my daughters a jbl radial. love the sound but the system will lock up your i pod. have seen several reviews with the same problem. called jbl about the problem. spoke to 3 different people in india who you could not understand. got an american on the phone and jbl denies they have had problems. ask around and you will find out. buy a bose or an apple hi fi if you can find one. i will never buy another jbl product.
4,It is a quality product,I like the fact it is easy to remove and clean. The main problem I see is small particles are easily lodged in the pleats and are hard to remove. It is a good filter and I love the fact that the DeWalt vacuum is a very handy item for cleaning up small areas where work has been performed.
5,I Miss These Guys!,"I aquired this CD ages ago but its effects still linger. It's an interesting psychedelic compilation of desert inspired musings. The sound is a little more lush than some of the groups previous efforts, and thats a good thing. Some of the tunes have a real singer-songwriter feel yet others are pure band stomps. I wish this group was still together. Or are they? Hmmm"
1,The cards fell apart,I bought these for my grandparents who have been playing Rook for years and this particular set bent easily the first use and were pealing by the end of the second use. The previous set my grandparents had for 10+ years and the new set they bought elsewhere are not having this issue. I was extremely disappointed.The backs of the cards also had a different design than shown in the picture.
3,"Nice set, but card durability poor","The box set is nice, the score pad and huge instruction booklet on the many ways to play the game, how to keep score, etc...BUT, the cards are not like the cards of even 10 years ago as far as durability. I bought these thinking they might be better than the Hasbro brand I had been buying at Wal-Mart, but they are very similar in durability. Very easily bent, flimsy, and wear out quickly. They will wear out after a few nights of playing, of course depending on how much they are played and shuffled each night.Nice set if you want a nice rule book and score pad, but if you know the game already and just want the cards, there are cheaper priced options out there that are the same in durability or better."
4,Deluxe Rook,"This isn't a toy, it's a card game for goodness sake! It's a game of Rook, that our family has played for years, and enjoys very much. These paticular cards are ok, but I would REALLY like to find plastic coated. Although these are supposed to be rated ""tournament quality"", they don't last very long."
2,Deluxe Rook,"I have been playing with the deluxe version for several years, recently bought 10 decks and im on the seventh one and after about three are four games cards begin to come apart on all the corners, and im playing on a felt top card table. This is the first ones ive had to do that, think i have a bad bunch."
2,Not a special book for EDI,the content of this book is not the same as the name of the book.its content is too general and it is not good as an EDI dictionary.The technical content of the book can be easyily found in other computer dictionary.
3,Paddle review,"The paddles are great, but not terribly easy to erase and get clean. The eraser is okay, but you need to use a cleaning wipe to get it really clean for the next group. I hope it lasts for a long time, they are great to use. Clever with the paddle, pen, and eraser on the end of the pen."
2,Disappointed,"This is a very attractive shoe in photos. Unfortunately it is cut deep over the vamp of the shoe, and does not fit comfortably on my size 7M, high instep foot. I really wanted a navy shoe like this, and I couldn't walk comfortably in this style. Where have all the navy shoes gone???"
1,This book holds the honor,"This book holds the honor of being the only book I have ever thrown in the garbage in anger before finishing. It's a terribly written book with a mediocre plot. Checking the author's personal web site revealed why he painted the characters the way he did. The plot just seems to ooze with the author's personal socio-politcal beliefs which might not be a bad thing if such beliefs furthered the plot along. It's not enough for the author to paint women as strong and influential (which is often done, and done well, in the Warcraft universe). No, the author also has to paint nearly all males in the book as mean and/or ignorant. I'm not hard to please when it comes to fantasy novels but this book was unbearably bad. If you're craving some more Warcraft lore, go back and re-read one of the books by Knaak, Golden, Rosenburg, or Grubb. I read them and enjoyed them all. How Blizzard let this book slip by their quality control is simply beyond me."
3,Review,"It is hard to say how effective this product actually is, there are so many external factors that could influence the desired results. The main ones are the amount of Dieting and Exercise the user participates in.You cant blame a company for marketing a product to appeal to peoples dreams, but lets just say, I'm no Arnie! Despite my work in the gym each day. The label on the container is a ridiculous cliché.I'll keep using the tablets and monitoring any progress.I doubt I'll buy any more"
1,Didn't work twice,I ordered this DVD two times and both times it wouldn't play on my TV or computer. I was very disappointed.
3,trying this out myself,"I am testing this product on my blog on cystic acne to see if it works. I have pics up and will have ""after"" pics also.[...]"
2,Lunarosa Women's Jatem Studded Low Heel Pump,"Cute shoe, but too wide at the heel. My feet slip out when I walk."
3,Nice coat for people with short arms.,"This coat is certainly made of great quality, all around great ... if you're arms are real real short. Or of course if you don't mind that when you lift your arms, even say to out in front of you, your sleeves are now half way up your arms! Compared with another coat of the same size the sleeves are shorter but the problem with this coat is where the seam is placed which is what causes the issue with the sleeves. We returned this one, didn't want to because of it's quality but just don't have short enough arms.*Gave it 3 stars because of it's quality, otherwise I would have given it the lowest possible."
5,Beautiful Photography,"There is no color. The B&W images are so good, they capture the true essence of beauty. Enhancing the female body by ten. This book made my wife (she is not impressed easily) stop and admire the quality of the photography and the beauty of the women."
3,Two Marines versus The Lightning,"Lee Powell and Herman Brix (later, Bruce Bennett) had been the last of five ""suspects"" as being the Lone Ranger in Republic's first serial featuring that radio hero. Here they team up again as a pair of Marines fighting a mad scientist called The Lightning, whose overblown manner is fun and whose headpiece may have been the prototype for Darth Vader (but I predict you'll have trouble guessing his identity). The cliffhangers keep both heroes in dire peril throughout."
5,i love the video awasome videp,stela! the storyteler is on her bathrobe again orher vodeps are the same thing i love babby bop and stella the storyteler carlos tosha barney and the other group that i love the video i love the john jacub ginger haret smight his name is my name too it kind of scared naimi when the queen was crying she was runonh to mef ive never seen her get scared like that tryed it again she had no proublam being affraid this time the once upon a time i love with stella and barney on a jorney into story lamd to here a tail from long ago once upon a time once upon a time means a story to tell a fairy tall but with everybody everywhere omce upon a time means a story to tell a fairy tall when you here the words once upon a time
5,No Disappointment Here,"I was a little concerned with the product ordered until my friend opened the package. She loved it, thought it felt great when put on. If she is happy, I am happy."
5,sexy and affordable,"I like this nighty, its very sexy and will fit a size 6 to 12 and if you have a tummy it will hide it. But it didnt hold up in the washer/dryer well so hand wash & dry flat. I have red,black & white."
3,Much Too Small For Me!,"For side sleepers like me, the Bi-Pod Bivy is way too tight in both the hip and shoulder areas. Also, I use the Therma-Rest NeoAir mattress which when fully inflated takes-up three inches in height.I have reordered and have received the heavier but far more spacious Tri-Pod Bivy. Its size is just right for me.The quality of both models is excellent.I have two complaints with both models. First, the zip-up opening is much too small. The opening should have at least one more foot to facilitate entry into the bivy. Second, I don't understand why the outer seams don't come pre-sealed from the factory. Instead you are sent a tube of sealer and a syringe and must seal it yourself."
2,Disappointed listener,"I have been listening to military band music for years, and am rarely disappointed. However, this compendium of music by the U.S. Navy, Army, and Marine bands and associated choral groups is not to my taste. Many of the arrangements are strange, and there is much too much vocal music when what I want to hear is the bands play. I would not have bought this album hhad I known beforehand what I know now."
3,Great diagram,"As usual this topic is all about advance abstract details, the book helps to clarify difficult issues.Excellent as a study text. Book was in great condition."
5,Outstanding,I have seen some previous comments that came along with 1/2 stars. The only thing I would like to say is that books that havedepth are not always easy to read. These require some effort from the reader.
4,Excellent but expensive,"I really liked the book. I think is a pretty good book and it came in a great shape. however, I also consider its kind of expensive."
3,Builds a good foundation for more complex books,"This is meant as an introductory book to the operating system concepts, and some applications. Most of the materials covered in this book have been covered even in books written in the 80's and 90's. It includes some supplement chapters on Windows 2000/XP and Linux. If you're just learning for the first time how an OS is suppose to function, then those supplement chapters won't make much sense to you. Since this book is a cooperation of three authors, you'll notice some inconsistencies and contradictory claims through out the chapters, especially in the first 5 chapters."
4,Very good,I didn't read any other book on operating systems. But I think this is one is very worth reading. (This is also a test to see if Amazon.com will post this message for me!)
1,worst packaging,"When I opened the packet, the book was broken from three corners. Especiallay, the back of hard cover was broken too. I am so disappointing. I just bought brand new book. My friends bought the used ones and they were way better then mine."
4,Son loves it but....,"I ordered this to replace the one that got broken in our home. My 3 year old son loves it even though it does have some pretty spooky content and it scares him a little! He's pretty skittish so I'm actually surprised it didn't spook him more...I would definitely suggest watching it first before your kids---I wish I had! I may have waited another year or so to let him watch it. But overall, another typical Thomas video..."
3,Too many talking heads,"This gives a good summary of JFK, Jr.'s lifeHowever, I was frustrated that the footage of him speaking as an adult was always cut short. This meant that I never got a good feeling for what he sounded like or how he moved as an adult.The people who were speaking about him were often annoying. They appeared to be trying to tell the viewer what the viewer's opinion of JFK, Jr. is as if the viewer would not be able to figure this out for him or her self."
4,awesome,"Original, wide ranging , metrical ambience with trance overtones. Don't be misdirected by the word ""symphony"" in the title. While quite sophisticated, this is not classical music--although some day it should be."
1,Easy Break,"If you buy this product,you are wasting your money. I had it for my cell phone for only a month nd the plastic clip broke off making the case useless since it could no longer clip on to my belt. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS LEATHER CASE."
4,"Daughter loves it, wood set is less quality then other melissa and doug products","Wood is a little cheaper quality then normal melissa and doug products, which made me kinda iffy on keeping it. My daughter loves it though so will be keeping!!! I just have to keep it away from my teething son or he could bite the numbers and ruin it."
2,"Good Advice, Poor Approach","The heart of Mama Gena's advice is this: Know what you want AND Ask for what you want. This is something that women, and I'm one of them, seem to have a difficult time doing. It can work, not always, but often it can work especially if you are unwilling to tolerate anything else or to do it yourself. However advice is only good if it can be heard and accepted. The tone of this book is one of, its difficult to classify, but some type of ""hip,"" urban, lingo between ""sister goddesses"". The level of familiarity made me uncomfortable, the number of vague vignettes were unhelpful, and the focus on feeling your sexuality also a bit vague. That is my biggest complaint: lots of general advice, little concrete suggestions and examples even though there are numerous ""exercises"" throughout the book. This isn't about ""men"" this is really about women and should be marketed as such."
2,Mama Gena's Owners & Operating Guide to Men,"Not exactly what I thought but has some insight into fun, pleasure and facing the world with a positive attidude."
1,Operate like a Parasite,"Do you want to learn how to be a parasite? Mama Gena can show you how.She not only show's you how, she also trains you how to fool yourselfinto thinking parasitic behavior is an intelligent approach to life.If manipulating others and 'living for your crotch' is your goal, this teaches you how. If you are uncertain how to feel about yourself when you behave this way, this book is for you.If she trains you that acting in this way is not the way a parasite behaves, then she controls your mind, just like she teaches in this book.I feel bad for the people who follow this advice.How will they be viewed when their beauty is gone, and they need to rely on their friendships? How will others treat them after they've lied and manipulated others for their whole life? Women who follow this advice will end up being the creepy aunt who goes to weddings alone, left alone to have fun by herself, a pathetic site to those around her."
4,Great toy for a curious young mind,"My 2+ year old likes this toy because he can manipulate its parts AND learn about the unseen. I like the toy because it is entertaining, durable, color-coded, educational, and can be played with again when he is older.Right now the toy is helping me to explain where a heart beat originates and where juice disapears to. The accompaning pamplet will help me answer his questions when he is older and more sophisticated."
1,"NOT ""full size""","When upgrading to a proper acoustic piano, I discovered that this keyboard is actually not full size. An octave on any acoustic piano is 6 and a half inches wide, and the total width of the key area is therefore a bit over 40 inches wide. On this keyboard, the octave is 6 and a quarter inches wide.The quarter of an inch difference may not sound like much, but the result is that I frequently accidentally hit the wrong key or an extra key. The difference in finger placement of a quarter inch causes a finger to land in the space between two keys, rather than on the center of the intended key.This error was designed into the keyboard. Each and every key is a bit too small.Buy a Roland keyboard instead. They sound better, feel better, and Roland knows how to use a tape measure."
2,3D-2D/Designers Republic,"I am a huge fan of the designers republic's earlier work and let me tell you, this is NOTHING like what I had expected. I purchased it right when it came out hoping to get a great book with great design and I must say that I was sorely disappointed. If you're looking for the old style TDR design with the fun icons and arrows this is not the book. Decent design, but nothing amazing by any means. Get the Futura book or a Ryan McGuinness book instead."
5,"cheerful, amazing,","this is a gem, the music is just gorgeous, refreshing and... old - real (if there is something like that) Gypsy music. I played it over and over. and it still good. Mishto!"
4,A Good Update,"This DVD is a good update from the ""Life Beyond Earth"" DVD that they put out eleven years ago. They know more now so it is more informative. I highly recommend getting it if you are interested in space, life beyond earth, and the like!:D"
4,A good movie that doesn't get enough attention,I used this to teach middle schoolers about bullying and cultural stereotyping ... I wish the Italian stereotypes weren't as prominent
2,Disseminates urban legends as factual,"I'd had high hopes for this as a humorous source book for use in teaching caution and warning labels.However, before incorporating material from this book, I'm glad I checked the credibility on Snopes; warning label stories cited in the book include false, proven urban legends.It's a shame that the book doesn't come with a warning label: ""CAUTION: Contents may be fictional""."
4,not as good as the hype,"Ive had this hammer drill for about 7 months now and can say it is the best cordless drill on the market for endurance.The company claims it has 600in lbs of torque in actuality 600in lbs of torque is not near enough to be compared to a corded drill.the drill will power a 2-9/16 self feed bit and I did get thru over 20 holes in redwood 2x on one charge but the motor stalls many times trying to keep that bit turning.The fit and finish of the tool are not milwaukee impressive and the cheap chinese plastic pieces integrated into the tool are unacceptable for a $400.00 tool.Overall you are paying for the battery which is very impressive but the tool itself is not. Milwaukee says ""cut the cord"" but they need to add about 200in lbs of torque to make that happen. the drill is larger than 18v units and slightly heavier.If you dont earn money with your tools and you dont have it to burn I would pass on this one."
3,"milwaukee 28volt drill, powerful but poorly built","I use this drill everyday, and i can tell you its a powerful drill. I bought this drill approximately one month ago and since that day have had the trigger sticking on a daily basis and have had the chuck screw fallout numerous times. I have been lucky enough to find it when it fallsout nearly evertime and i just put it back in. My supervisor owns the same drill and had to send his in for repair for the same problem but when his fell out so did the chuck and the chuck then broke.Well now i have lost the screw this time and decided that this is enough. Brought it back to the store i bought it from for an even exchange. Hope this drill changes my mind but as far as im concerned this drill is a safety hazard and its not just an isolated incident. Dont buy this drill if you want to keep your fingers and dont wanna waste the 400$ this high priced finger hazard of machine will cost you. BUY A DEWALT"
1,3rd use started falling apart,"After the 3rd use the valve started falling apart, at the 4th use it stopped working completetly. now I have to buy a new one, very inconvenient. would not recomend."
3,Black Tiger Backs Print,"I absolutely love the look of a deck of cards , and almost no deck looks better than the Black Tiger sold by E!. I have all of the E! prints and all appeal to me for different reasons, but this one appeals in its simplicity. It's understated and simple. That stands out when framed properly. It gives these cards the respect they deserve , anyone can look at this print and appreciate it for what it is , you don't have to be a magician to see that this piece of art is a visually appealing simplistic piece of eye-candy. It fits in no matter where you put it , it is one of those pieces that goes well in a dorm room , or a library and everywhere in-between. It is classy and subtle all at the same time. Like Brad Christian said ""simple hits hard"" and it most definetly applies here."
5,This video box set came in the mail today,"I got this in the mail from MPI Home Video. It was great, nevertheless."
4,read this.,"I have milwaukee's 18v version for two years and then this saw for about 7 months, it is the best cordless circ saw on the market right now, for both power and endurance.BUT: it is not a replacement for a corded saw as milwaukee advertises, it will do on 1 battery what the 18v's do on 2.IT's fit and finish are very good and the tool is about the same weight as the 18v. this is a good buy."
5,Gems of Wisdom,Eugene Peterson has done a wonderful job of locating and organizing the promises of the Bible. A quick way to find solace and help when needed or to be reminded of the things God promises to us.
5,Time Travel,"What a beautiful book! Hardcover and full of the most deliciuous information. Mr. Burness has compiled, from his own collection of original railroad advertising a real time travel to explain us in the words of the railroads themselves (and some related industries-even Lionel), the evolution, successes and problems of American rail industry. The ads are sorted in alphabetical order by company name. From the 20's and 30's going through that heroic period of WW II and the postwar years and coming to Amtrak, you will witness the introduction of dome cars, the new trains like the California Zephyr, new technical achivements and so on. Reading this book you will feel the fallen flags so alive that is difficult to realize that most of them disappeared 30 or 40 years ago.And it is not only the trains. Reading these ads you will be back in time in the United States of yesterday. The problems, the people and their fashions, etc. You will really enjoy this book."
3,"There are better ways to go than ""starter kits""","I have a Yamaha RBX170 electric bass guitar, which is basically just a slightly better version of the guitar that comes with the ERB070 bass guitar ""starter kit"". I've always been impressed with Yamaha's quality, and these lower-end bass guitars don't disappoint.However, I'd recommend going with the RBX170 bass, and save the rest of your money and pick up a decent amp. For the same amount of money, I got a slightly better Yamaha guitar (with a better agathis body, better pickups, and with more choice of colors), and an amp that is better than just a practice amp."
2,All about Romance,"Desiree was signed to Motown during a time when they were reinventing the label with acts like The Boys, and Johnny Gill.What's striking about this release was the lack of any real late 1980's hitmaking songwriters/producers. **The Boys and Johnny Gill had label debuts produced by Babyface, and Jimmy Jam/Terry Lewis.This disc is filled with dated, forgettable songs; with the exceptions being Romance & Until Tonight.""Romance"" was a wonderful way to start the album. Although not a star maker, the song has great lyrics, and incredible vocals (a plus was having Levert back her up!) and has aged really well.""Until Tonight"" was written by Peter Lord 3 years before he wrote/produced ""Rush, Rush"" and ""Promise of a new day"" for Paula Abdul.Had Motown given Desiree a stronger start, she'd be a huge star today. Her gospel recordings are nice, but you cant help thinking what a waste."
5,Excellent reference,This book serves as a great reference and a good introductory text as well.The fourth edition is supposed to be released soon so it's probably worth waiting for it.I recommend owning this book along with High Performance MySQL.
3,This is not the box you get at amazon.com,"This is not the box you get! It dont even look like this one, the right number for the outide box is LW002GRU i got two of these, this is the wrong pic. (its a good inside box) got it at amazon.com."
4,Great ideas; check open days/time on line,"Just finishing a month in Paris with my 7 year old and used this book daily as a starter for planning our activities. As with any travel book, double check the opening times and days on-line for EVERY place you want to go. Even with the big museums, various exhibits are often closed on certain days even if the museum says they are open. (Ex: Louvre doesn't have enought staff to keep every gallery open every day. Their website tells you what's open when so you don't take your future Egyptologist to the Louvre when most of those rooms are closed.) If you are from the United States, also take with a grain of salt when a commercial venue (not historic monument or museum) is rated as 'great' in this book. As my older boys observed on a visit to Paris with me 13 years ago: Europe does ""old"" really well and the USA does ""new"" really well. You don't come to Paris to go to water parks and toy stoys!"
2,Not for VX8300,"This didn't work for the VX8300 for which I purchased it. The plastic plug has a different pattern than the VX8300, so it doesn't fit.I give the seller 5 stars for responding immediately to resolve the situation (e-mailed at night and they responded by morning). I think they should update the description next. :-)"
5,This will get his attention!,"I broke out the ""Weekender Kit"" and found that even the most unimaginative guy will develop some creativity with this Set! You cannot go wrong with anything in this box -- I think the Honey Dust is definately my favorite. 5 stars for anyone who wants to liven things up a bit!"
3,Rated for size,"I bought this as a gift for a bachelorette party, thinking that the variety + price would equal a great little something extra. I wasn't expecting a full size item, but I did think that they would be about the size of a travel shampoo bottle. I couldn't open it as it was a gift, but the box everything is contained in is about the size of a deck of cards. I hope that the item is enjoyed, but for the price I expected a little bit more quantity. The item was well-packaged and looked pretty classy, but I wanted to note that the box is that size just so people are aware."
1,This product is a rip-off.,"This product is not worth your time. The ""samples"" are not large enough to make a decision whether you like the products or not. The packaging leaked, honey-plus massage oil does not equal an enjoyable experience, it equals a gooey mess in the box that is smaller than a deck of cards.I was not satisfied with this product at all."
4,Very Entertaining,"You'll laugh till there's nothing left in you. Though you will cringe quite a bit. These truly are real fights that people thought to record. People are being hit or kicked in the face, and being flug through parking lots. Black women are taking their shoes off to smack one another crazy with, or pulling out each other's weaves. When a fight breaks out in a neighborhood every nearest person and then some flock like ants to watch, in 40 seconds or less. You will be truly amazed when watching this. In some places a street fight is the highlight of the day.Well worth to watch."
3,"Good, but not the best in the series!","I enjoyed the book, for the most part. It was extremely boring at first but at it progressed, it finally grabbed my attention. This isn't the most exciting book in the series, but to understand the rest of the series, you have to read it. You'll enjoy it by page 60 or so, but it's a ""SNOOZER"" before then."
1,Needs help to work,"I bought this thinking of the movie Pollyanna and wanted to share it with my daughter. It does work but only after I manually start it spinning. It does not spin on it's own, I have to start it every time. It will spin for quite a while even without direct sun light. But it should spin without having to activate it every time!!! Bit expensive for not working on it's own."
2,Gears quit working after a few months,"This is a great idea and completely delighted my daughter and the cats as well. Unfortunately it is cheaply made. The plastic gears inside began to slip after about a month. Within 6 months, the gears inside spin like crazy but the prism doesn't move. I called Marshall Field's to ask about a replacement and they absolutely refuse after 90 days. So based on the list price, you can decide if it is worth it for 6 months."
5,Rainbow after Rainbow!,"I love this solar powered prism. It turns my kitchen into not just an ordinary kitchen, but a rainbow disco. I have ordered and given away about 6 of them. They are my favorite gift to give. thank you!"
5,Love that Rainbow Maker!!!!!,"I have two in my home and give them for gifts. They brighten up my day, shooting rainbows from floor to ceiling. I give them to people in the hospital and as hostess gifts. Everyone is thrilled to receive them. I just ordered 4 more. A real deal - on sale with free shipping. Thanks to whoever invented this incredible, delightful gizmo."
2,Worked for a month,"I got this as a gift at Christmas and put it in my baby's room. It worked great for a month and she loved it, then it stopped working. It no longer turns and some of the gears are broken."
2,Bad sound quality ruins a good production,"Be warned. The sound quality on these CDs is very poor. They sound like highly compressed MP3s. Why they would do this is baffling, and if I was the narrator of the set I'd be furious with the finished product.There's another unabridged Anna Karenina CD set by Blackstone books read by Nadia May that has better sound quality, though still not great.On the other hand the 2 volume unabrigeded War and Peace set by Naxos AudioBooks, 2006 has a great narrator and crystal clear uncompressed sound. It's more expensive than this set, but a magical experience to listen to. In contrast, this set should have been great, but I soon gave up since it sounds like I'm listening to the narrator through a lousy modem instead of in my living room by a warm fire."
1,Dreadful Signs,"In his book, Alan Caruba abuses the malicious influence of fear and anxiety in order to establish his baseless ultra-conservative ideas. He mixes fact with fiction to come at conclusions that are far from reality. Our world would have been a much better place today if it wasn't for these so-called ""Warning Signs""."
1,"Poor research, political blinders, and no new content","First of all, this book's entire contents is already available online at the author's website for the National Anxiety Center, so there is no reason at all to waste $12 on a print copy.Secondly, Caruba can't tell a fact from a hole in the ground. Go through any of his columns and try to verify any of the ""facts"" upon which his opinions are supposedly based. He frequently gets the basic facts wrong, very wrong. Not everytime, but far more often than is excusable. It's hard tell to if he's a liar or just stupid.Finally, Caruba is about as conservative as they come-not that being a conservative should, by itself, precludes someone from doing good journalism. But in Caruba's case it does: all his conclusions are entirely in step with conservative dogma, and more often than not, out-of-step with established science. If Caruba occasionally had opinions contrary to conservative dogma, I'd be more inclined to believe he is an indenpendent thinker."
4,Love all the tips on finding treasures.,"I would recommend this book to all who are looking for great inside tips on what to look for, even down to what should you wear when going to garage sales or flea markets or Estate Sales.Loved the book and would buy other books from this Author. I would rate this 4 stars ****"
2,Not as good as Moon Handbooks,"If you're going to South Korea, I suggest you buy the Moon Handbooks guidebook. I took both it and the Lonely Planet book to Korea and I didn't use the Lonely Planet book. The Moon guidebook has more information and history on the sites, plus they have more places in it. I found a description of almost every place I visited even if it was just a small memorial off the side of the road. The Lonely Planet book does have more about places to stay and eat, but I found the Moon Handbook to be sufficient in this area, so I left the Lonely Planet book at home."
2,"Accomodation info: OK, other things: could be better.","This book, like the other Lonely Planet series are generally quite informative and quite handy. The first thing that you will find lack in this book is the name of the places in Hangul. With most of the names in Korea are written in Hangul (except in big cities), this is obviously a big oversight from the author. The part of the book listing the different expression to use in the restaurant is not that helpful either because they're too general and will bring some funny look when you show that to the restaurant owner. If you like hiking, then you will get a lot of information for where to go, but if you're more like the cultural-acitivity type of a person, then the book may not be the best bet. Beware of the maps, some of them are just totally wrong! and some of the information for transports are completely outdated. The accomodation info is good though, cheap and in general pretty nice places."
3,Where is Johnny Was or Tin Soldiers?,"On my cover of the DVD the last song has Johnny Was. I was looking forward to listening to it, but it is not on the DVD. Tin Soldiers is another great hit which is not on this DVD. I've been a fan for 30 years, and was disappointed not to see these tracks on there. It really teases you on the cover track list with ""Johnny Was"" and then you don't get to see it.Always A Fan.The Dustman"
5,"Lovely! My three year loved it, so did I...",This beautifully illustrated and wonderfully written book is that rare children's story that teaches and says something important while preserving the wonder and magic of how children (grown and otherwise) view the world.
3,Ideas to spark imagination,"This book is geared more towards people building a new, custom house or remodeling, which is not what I expected. I was looking for decorating ideas without tearing down walls. In addition, it gives you a glimpse of the room and leaves the rest up to the imagination. The book assumes you're working with an architect and interior decorator and they'll take care of the details. It is packed with amazing kids room and has sparked ideas of my own for my decorating his playroom."
2,"not for the home owner, but the home BUILDER","This book has many creative ideas. But, they are mostly ideas that would require major remodeling, would be impossible, or would only be helpful when designing your blue prints. There are decorating ideas, but overall, this book is geared more toward the architect. An example is an in-the-wall loft, and another is a split level bedroom. Also, the rooms are rarely your average square bedroom but instead have very creative floor plans. SO- the book is creative and attractive, but not very useful."
3,"Good reading, general cooking","I too thought the book was funny, although not known to be a comedy book. I liked the stories Dave's mom had to tell. The pie crust failed miserably though. What's with [modern] women these days? Have we forgotten how to cook?"
3,funny as hell,"terribly amusing quick read. everett has a very witty tongue-in-cheek writing style that will keep you smiling throughout this thinly veiled work of ""fiction""."
5,My God!,A definate must read for anyone who appriciates healthy doses of twisted humor. Quite witty. I can see this book as a movie....
3,Repeat episodes,"My daughter really enjoys the series, but lately has gotten bored of watching the same episodes. We loved the Christmas DVD, but this DVD had two episodes which were already shown of TV. Only one episode was new. It was rather disappointing."
5,"Truly ""magical"" Christmas album","Takes christmas a step beyond the music box albums... a glorious shambles of mechanical boxes, ""disc pianos"" (?), choir/handbell performers, tower bells, and warm, warbly street bands. The variety of performance media is unique, but the arrangement is also fascinating - many of the famous tunes are passed from one kind of device to the next, building cumulatively in a way that a single music box cannot do. A great success."
2,"I never received this product, but I did order it","I was sent two of the animal magnets instead of the dinosaur magnets that I ordered, so I can't really give this product a review."
4,Fun magnets,Our son likes to crawl around the kitchen while we're prepping dinner or whatever. These give him something simple and colorful to play with. The quality is descent and the designs are fun. Just be prepared to go fishing for them under the fridge.
1,don't order any big ticket merchandise,DISCUSSING THEY SEND ME 2 TOPS OF THE DESK AND THEY SAID THEY ARE ONLY ALLOWED TO CORRECT IT TWICE SO NOW I HAVE TO DESK TOPS BECAUSE SOMEONE COULD NOT READ OR UNDERSTAND THE ORDER SO IF ANYONE NEEDS A DESKTOP I HAVE TWO. I AM VERY UNDERSET AND I THINK I WILL TAKE A YEAR BREAK FROM ORDERING FROM THEM BY THAT TIME SOMEONE SHOULD BE ABLE TO READ
5,Solid wood desk and hutch,"Although I am very pleased with my new desk and hutch, I am very unhappy with the way Amazon presented the hutch. When purchasing the desk, I was looking for a desk that was affordable but nice. I also needed some storage above the monitor. The hutch was perfect. However, Because of the way it was presented, I believed the desk also came with the hutch. It does not. The desk is an additional $100. I was very upset. I would have sent back the hutch, but I would have lost my original shipping as well as the shipping for returning it. Like I said the desk is beautiful and will last for a very long time. It is well put together and solid. The hutch looks nice with the desk and they are both quality, worth the money. I love the desk, but I am upset with Amazon's representation of the hutch. There needs to be some extra clear specification that the hutch is separate from the desk."
5,A Must-Read for Anyone Who Wants to be Sex-Smart,"Forget the ""Rules"" - Here are the facts!! This is a clear, concise, fun-to-read book that will open your eyes about the real rules of sex - everything you need to know about sex and dating, marriage, affairs, what women and men really want, saying no, saying YES! Share it with your friends, read it in bed with a lover. You won't believe how much fun learning can be."
4,GREAT HEATER TO EXTEND THE SUMMER ON THE DECK,"I HAD THIS HEATER OUTSIDE ON MY DECK FOR OVER 8 YEARS AND GOT MANY HRS. OF USE OUT IT. HOWEVER IT DID STOP WORKING SUDDENLY(10/25/12). I CAN APPRECIATE ALL THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS ABOUT THE TRIANGLE HEAD SCREWS. I TOOK A PHILIPS SCREWDRIVER AND GROUND IT TO FIT THE TRIANGLE TIP SCREW SO I COULD TAKE IT APART EVEN THOUGH YOU CAN BUY THAT TOOL ON AMAZON,I JUST DID'T WANT TO WAIT FOR IT TO COME. I OPEN UP THE JUNCTION BOX FIRST AND ONE OF THE CONNECTIONS BROKE SO I JUST FIXED IT AND PUT IT BACK TOGETHER WITH #8X32 STAINLESS SCREWS SO IT WILL BE EASIER TO REPAIR AGAIN. IT WORKS GREAT AGAIN, MAYBE I'LL GET ANOTHER 8 YRS. OUT OF IT.I WOULD DEFINITELY BUY THIS AGAIN BUT TAKE ALL THE TRIANGLE HEAD SCREWS OUT BEFORE THEY RUST AND REPLACE WITH THE 8 X 32 STAINLESS SCREWS RIGHT FROM THE BEGINING.WE LOVE THIS HEATER BUT MAYBE ITS NOT FOR PEOPLE WHO AREN'T HANDY,BUT THEN AGAIN IT DID WORK FOR 8 YRS."
4,Good little heater,"We installed this on our patio to protect our plants from the 10 freezing nights we get a year. Installation was really easy. We have had 3 freezing nights and so far so good for our plants. I worry about the pull cord, it seems kind of thin and over time the string may get weak and break. I think I will have to find a solution to this issue. Price was right. Looks good."
1,Amy's Joy,"Not every woman's. I am totally disapointed in this book. Shame of it, Amy's Joys aren't the same or close to mine and I consider myself normal. Honestly, how can anyone write that many pages of dribble. Save your money, if you are dying to read it, try the library! Thank God I did and can take it back tomorrow!"
1,awful!,"The author spends the first 13 chapters convincing the reader how hideously ugly the hero is. So, you end up with an image of a lovely young woman married to a grotesque oaf of a man. There are a million ""mix-ups"" which become tiresome and annoying. A complete waste of 384 pages.Huge thumbs down."
1,A great dissapointment,"Unfortunately, this book is not a revision or improvemnet of the original sixth and seventh books of Moses as originally translated. It is an improvemnt on the De Laurence editon only becuae it has better type setting. It has no proper scholarly atributions nor are the seals corrected. For someone who is the least bit familiar with this magical work, it is not worth the money."
3,Good for price,"Quality could be better. I would pay a few more dollars if this was sturdier.We bought two (they stack) to have at our front door. They hold about 8 pairs of shoes each, but when stacked, the 'tower' tends to be a little wobbly. Not too bad, but not too sturdy either. Each rack by itself is sturdier than multiple racks stacked together."
4,Sturdy File Cart For Normal Home/Student Use,Once assembled the cart appears very sturdy for normal day to day student use - not recommended for any heavy usage as in an office. I took the suggestion made by others to glue the bottom of the drawer to give it some added sturdiness - Haven't received any complaints from my daughter yet (2 months) so I guess its OK and withstanding abuse.Assembly instructions were adequate - just follow the pictures.
4,Easy and Sturdy!!,"I think this file cabinet is GREAT. It was very easy and quick to put together (remember that its real wood so its heavy and it takes some strength to put together). Once together it was very solid and sturdy. It didn't wobble at all and the drawer worked fine. I also have the computer desk in this line of furniture (Mission) and it is of the same quality. (However, due to its size, it was a little more difficult to put together...more like a 2-person job at some stages of the assembly.)"
3,looks good,"seems like a great idea, easy cheap bonsi garden. my little seedling started to grow right away but so did something else. i had a rampant out brake of a thick white mold which swept though and killed everything in the dome. this think also came with no instructions, which could have helped prevent the mold epedemic."
4,Spot on,"Very good for those starting surgical training. It's a good introduction to the techniques you might have to do as a surgical SHO, and it's got some good general prinicples. The content is very well organised, and it is a good guide to the basics of several specialities. One thing I like about it is that it covers most of the aspects of surgery that the beginner may neglect, such as medical problems in the surgical patient. Definitley a good move for surgical trainees"
2,A cross-section of handbell ringing in England,"This recording includes contributions by four handbell ensembles in England, all very different. For the most part, the CD consists of English folk tunes, carols, and change ringing. The change ringing group is well worth a listen, as it is the latest incarnation of the ancient art form that made England the ""Ringing Isle."" The other ensembles very much reflect the ""community band"" concept, with all that entails: much enthusiasm and excitement, but rough around the edges. For the collector, though, this is an important piece of handbell ringing history and well worth having."
3,Infinite variety,"I first heard a track from this album on BBC Radio 3: it was Treble Bob, Sixteen In, and it was magical. But when I came to hear the whole album, it is thematically all over the place. Beautiful ringing, but it doesn't seem sure of its audience.I'd love to hear an album entirely like Treble Bob, Sixteen In - changes rung on handbells. It would be a wonderful meditation background."
1,Worst investment book I've ever seen,"I can't believe this 260 page book has appendices that start on page 117!! Over half of this book is lists of stocks included in the ETF's...easily obtainable on the web. We didn't need to kill trees for this! I thought the author would discuss sector swapping strategies, etc. , but not in this book. This book just contains some basic information about ETF's in today's market."
5,Great Book,The three stories in this book were very enjoyable. They all had a sense of humor. I really enjoy historical romances.
2,"Eh, not great","I have used this product several times and have consistently been disappointed in the results. The little brush is useless, nothing has come out sparkling clean no matter how long it soaks. The container leaks, I tossed it."
5,Great Product,"Quality karaoke tracks as well as demonstration tracks. It is a really nice product. However before buying this from the seller I got it from I want to let you know I was very disappointed with the service from the seller. I ordered it for a two day ship and was charged almost as much as the dvd for the shipping and it did not arrive when I needed it. I even took the time to write them an email letting them know when I needed it and why. According to the post office it was not shipped on time, therefore it did not arrive when I needed. Love the dvd. Will never purchase from this seller again."
4,Graphic Guide to Frame Construction: Details for Builders and Designers (For Pros by Pros),great book. Recommend it to anyone how would like to learn about framing.
2,Doesn't live up!,"For a book called Frame Construction, Mr. Thallon spent a lot of pages on NON-framing issues, foundations and roofing, and forgot to put anything in about the math of framing. Just take a look at the section on framing stairs, nothing there but some basic diagrams.Sorry but for every good drawing the should be an equally clever formula for the calculations of the art of framing. I am not all that fired up about this one."
5,Framing,"This is a wonderful addition to any collection of carpentry books. Good clear explanations, precise drawings, and a great resource for experts and novice alike."
4,Good Reference Book,For a layman home owner like me this book is very detailed. I want to know pros/cons of each options specified. I would like to see Good/Better/Best options for each construction method or material recommended.Having said that I want this book by my side when I am doing addition so at least I know what's going on. Definitely recommend this book but not as a main book but as a reference book. Don't expect best practices clearly defined.
5,Great reference,A great reference for the DIY homeowner. Lots of drawings to show you the right way to do things from foundations to framing.
4,Good Glass - Good Price,These glasses aren't going to change your life but they are a great set of glasses for the money. They are not thick clunkers like some of the restaurant style glasses of the same size. The base is moderately thick and the lip is a nice medium thickness - which I like.I like the fact that they are rather compact for the 20 oz size but don't taper so they hold a maximum amount of drink.My shipment arrived on time and I had no broken glasses. I am pleased with this purchase.
5,Superb! Don't Miss This Movie!!!,"This is a superbly written and superbly acted ""play"" transformed into a movie. This must be among the ""Ten Best Movies of All Time"". If you haven't seen this one, PLEEESE get it. You won't be disappointed. Comments to email: boland7214@aol.co"
1,Vendor Provided Poor Quality Product,"The vendor I purchased ""A Raisin in the Sun"" from misrepresented the product. I was overcharged for shipping, the product was damaged and not viewable. I asked for a refund and have not received a response in at least 3 weeks if not longer. I will never buy a product from that vendor again."
5,great video!,"This video is great. There are 4 or 5 different videos on the DVD. They are fun, full of music, and movement to keep kids' attention, and even have a good moral theme in them."
3,It is fun to watch but not too excitingfor my 3.5 years old,"Although, the characters are fun and colorful, my daughter did not find the DVD too exciting. She could not watch the whole DVD, only one or two episodes at a time. She enjoys the Little Einsteins or Mickey's Club House much more than Johny."
3,"Excellent likeness, well done, not very posable","This Jessica is indeed a good likeness of the movie character, but it's not very posable, just a bit of arm and head swivel, and the clothes don't come off, so you can't change her or have her posing. At least they did give her that little bit of movement, I suppose. She's a fun gal, just limited."
4,Trip Down Memory Lane,"A thorough and loving ode to horror movies from Psycho to the early 2000's. I enjoyed re-visiting some of the flicks I grew up on. I never found them scary, but that didn't detract from my pleasure of them.Matthew Goodwin"
3,"Commendable, but slight...","Rockoff clearly loves the genre and his behind-the-scenes tales on such slasher faves as ""Nighmare"" and ""Maniac"" are very interesting...I just wanted more...The book barely cracks 200 pages and leaves out a host of deserving slashers (Where's Madman?The Final Terror? Hide and Go Shriek? Rockoff mentions The Burning as having spawned the most future stars of any slasher, but the Final Terror had Joe Pantoliano, Darryl Hannah, the incomparable Adrian Zmed and Rachel Ward, not too shabby!) The book is a good appetizer, but it will leave you wanting more (especially for that price...ouch!)"
4,Works well,It works nicely. Can even add your own things to its library. Cons are is that it should be quiet when you speak into it and it doesn't shut off. Otherwise it's great
1,Not as advertised,We purchased this Model SS101 when it first came out and would not recommend it for the following reasons. It has a difficult time recognizing voice entries and it burns through batteries very rapidly in spite of the fact that we don't use it that often and only print out a list once every 2 weeks. Hopefully newer Models have made improvements in these areas but this Model is not a bargain at any price.
3,"Had Problems, So Have Ordered A Replacement.","Really like it when it is working right. Got it for my wife for Christmas. After a period of time for her to become accustomed to it, & for it to get use to her voice, she really liked it.Problems started almost immediately. When she would try to add an item, the cursor would jump all over the screen making it a real chore to load 1 word. Then it would start to print lists without commanding it too. These problems started within 2 weeks.We just ordered a replacement, hoping we got a lemon, because it can be extremely helpful. Will post another review on the new one once we work with it for at least a month."
3,My smartShopper Burps at me,"Well , I really did want to like this but it didnt turn out that way. Oh well , I will be putting this on ebay for $30 bucks now! It also burps after I add something to the list. Too wierd and it scared the living cr@p out of the first time!"
3,Smartshopper,Its hard to recognize items but the ones it does recognize it goes smoothly. Wish I would have waited for the new and improved one that came out two weeks later.
1,"Great idea, bad execution","I bought this for my wife and it quickly became her least favorite Christmas present. It does not recognize even the simplest items. Neither one of us could get it to recognize ""Milk"" I've already contacted the company and am returning the unit since it does not work as advertised."
3,Works OK>>>,"Yes it is cool, but it does have a difficult time picking up words. It also has some random words preloaded and also missing items I think are basic.go figure."
5,I LOVE this thing!!!,"I've had the Smart Shopper 101 for over 1 year now and it's fantastic. At first I had to repeat a few things but it got it and now I can't imagine living without it. Things cross my mind quickly that I need to pick up at the market and I just run to my SS, push the button and say the item and it's saved. Then before I got to the store, I print out my list.I didn't even read the reviews that other people left because I know this thing is great and believe me...I'm really picky!!!"
4,Great Buy,"I first saw the SmartShopper, Model #SS101, in an upscale shopping district store which first sold for over $100. This is now such a greatbuy when purchasing from Amazon and also makes a wonderful gift. I've only discovered a very few times when the item recognition failed, but when spoken in a normal speed and tone of voice using clear syllables, the SmartShopper performs very well. I don't need reading glasses since the text is large enough and there's an automatic light which brightens the screen during use. No more hunting for pens, pencils or paper to make up a grocery list. The internal magnet sturdily holds SmartShopper on my refrigerator which is convenient for face level operation. The printer works well except it could use some extra speed, but is sufficient with a little patience. Overall, I love this grocery list helper and would not want to be without the SmartShopper."
4,Smartshopper's not dumb,"The product concept is excellent, the product itself is very good. The voice recognition is good, not excellent, and when you input a non-listed item, the input method is a bit tedious and the cursor jumps around unprompted. This happened on two different Smartshoppers because I sent the first one back because of it. But when the voice recognition works, which is most of the time, it is excellent. It saves time and printing the list out is a no-brainer. Love to see version 2."
4,I bought it anyways and love it.,"I bought this product despite the reviews on this site, and I must say it's a great buy. In all fairness, the Smart Shopper did not recognize when I said ""ham"" (must be my Hispanic accent) but all I had to do was record my voice saying ham and labeling it. It took less than a minute to program and now it recognizes when I say ""ham""! I also programmed brand names I like to buy.If you want to cut down of the time you send crisscrossing though the supermarket then buy the SS..."
5,Love this tool!,This is a fantastic tool to have in the kitchen. It is very easy to use. Most items are already included in the list. It's so easy and the printout makes it a dream for quick runs to the grocery or to remember other errands.
5,The Coolest,This is one of the best gadgets! It makes grocery shopping/errand running fun and organized; it is easy to use and worth the price.
1,BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The super shopper is by far the biggest waist of money, if you want another refrigerator magnet just go to a hardware store, voice recognition software is awful, set up an item, record a voice tag then try the item, still does not work, very disapointed, just too much of a hassle to return. Live and learn. 1 star, just because you can't send a review for anything less."
5,Don't know if it was a great product or not,"My SO is an eternal list maker but never can find the lists. I thought this would be a great birthday present since it was listed in Parade Magazine as one of the tope 10 gadgets of the year. I gave it to him and he wouldn't even open the box, so I returned it unopened. He is an techie and is closed minded to gadgets that he hasn't researched endlessly on the Internet."
2,"Love, hate","I have had this item for over a year now and some days I love it, some days I hate it.Some days it won't recognize ANYTHING I say. It never recognizes anything at all that my son says. I have added a few items that it recognizes but it is stubborn about new items.I don't like that you can't edit where an item is in the store. Peanut butter is not a snack, it should be with condiments. I think of snacks as cookies and chips.I bought it before the price reduction. I'd probably love it more days if I would have paid less. For what I paid I think I should love it everyday."
4,"Takes a lot of set up time, but then very helpful","I found that I have had to reenter most of the products I use with the names I call them and in my voice before the voice recognition would pick them up correctly. This has taken a lot of time, but it is paying off now as I now only have to say the name of the item once or twice to get it to go in."
1,Don't pay this price!,Chick Hicks is one of the hardest cars to find but keep trying. My nephew wanted this car for Christmas. My sister had everyone she knew looking for this car for 3 weeks. We finally found it at Toy R Us for $3.49 a week after Christmas. We had managed to find all the other cars before this one. Don't pay this price for it. Now that Christmas is over there will be a lot more of these around.
4,Stick Welder,"Again I have received great service from Amazon. I have purchased other Campbell Hausfeld items in the past and I am very pleased with the quality and value I get from them. The reviews are more than helpful when I decided to buy this welder. I encourage everyone who buys from Amazon to take the time and state their opinion of the items they get.The welder does what I need it to do. I am not a professional welder but I know enough to see it was well worth the low price. If you are thinking of buying one, remember it is small and requires small welding rods. I found 5/64"" #6013 rod to work the best with this welder.Thanks again Amazon for the great service and product.KHOP"
4,Fun Now and Later,"I purchased three ""Paint the Wild: Puppies"" kits for my daughters, ages 5, 8, and 10. They very much enjoyed the process of painting the puppies to match their favorite breeds, as well as some newly created breeds straight from their imagination.The puppies are a lightweight wood (likely balsa or soft pine) and are durable enough to play with after the paint has dried. There's plenty of paint included to complete your masterpieces.Satisfaction with this product has inspired my decision to purchase other ""Paint the Wild"" kits. The horses were also a big hit with my children.This is a good choice to fill a rainy afternoon. Also is an excellent gift item."
5,Howling fun!,"We got this puppy kit for my daughter's birthday party. She spent more time on it than any other toys she got (maybe 20 gifts). It is a good, classic toy and I was suprised how well she can paint (she's 7). The only thing I would like to have more is a couple additional paintbrushes so her brother can do it at the same time with the other 2 puppies."
5,wonderful,Grace and beauty of mixed sound from East and West make this CD a fascinating moment of joy. The world is filled with bright colors of cherry blossoms.Eri Sugai gives to a listener harmony of a world that we desire and that is just a dream.Filippo Zizzo
5,Heirloom quality museum piece,This was the toy nobody wanted. Mattel created this piece as a collector's item but it is a legitimate toy. This Pinocchio is a real marionette puppet made of real wood but they made only a few due to the fact that it did not sell well. The quality is unsurpassed. Not only is he made of real wood but his darling clothes and painted face make him a joy for children and adults. I remember when Amazon.com had the last batch of these puppets in the outlet section and were selling them for $40. I bought one (not really needing it)just because it was cheap and cute. I think Mattel was selling them for $200 originally just for the hardcore Disney fans.Because of the rarity of this item they only show up on eBay about once per year. Not sure how much it is worth monetarily but it is priceless becuase of the quality and enjoyment one can get when playing with it.
2,Tube filled with gas?,"Squeezed my tube today, and about 1/3 of the tube came out with some kind of air (probably some gas that doesn't cure the silicone). The metal tube says 3.35oz bu weight, but there's no way that this pre-sized metal tube can be filled to 3.35oz with a third of its volume being gas.What would YOU do in this situation? Tell Amazon to take it back, or just suck it up?Otherwise, it's the same RTV goop that we've all used on our cars."
1,housewife scratches an image and calls herself artist,"This a book dealing with nothing more than a technique and has nothing to do with art. Her Polaroid manipulations are awful, demeaning the entire creative process. It tries to be a how to book and it is. But, like I said, her work falls tremendously short of good."
3,it's okay,I ordered this with the hopes of being more in clusters versus being granular/flakes. The taste was good but I ended up giving it to a friend to make cookies with...I received it quickly...thank you
3,"First pack out of 4 tasted great, the second tasted raw - also higher fat content","I ordered a four pack of this product and the first pack had a great tasting stuff, but the content of second one was probably under-toasted as it tasted rather raw.Also, for those who watch their fat intake, please note that it has higher fat calories percentage than a typical granola cereal (40 out of 130), and canola oil is listed as one of the ingredients."
2,Fair but I would not buy again.,I was not very impressed by this product. It was not horrible but I prefer the muesli made by the same company.
4,Real Coconut fla,"As with all Bob's Red Mill products, I got what I was expecting. A great quality product. Low sugar, high protein and a healthy, quick snack. This had a very coconutty flavor."
5,Worked out great!,"I loved this vanity cabinet. It was the exact color in the picture and the black top was stunning. My bathroom remodel was great, but wouldn't have been without this piece. Thanks!"
2,Terrible quality,"I have originally purchased this item for its sleek design and an affordable price. To start, assembling the unit was a frustrating experience for my husband, who is usually very handy, and this table seemed like it would be a piece of cake to put together, and it wasn't. Also, even though the base of this changing table is wood, the shelves - including the top one where you'd lay the baby - are extremely thin.Overall, nice design, but very poor quality. There are much better options out there, for about $[...] extra, which would be well worth it. I am disappointed and would not recommend this changing table."
1,As cheaply made as possible.,"This company has good customer service which is important since you'll constantly be contacting them. As shipped, the wood is cracked and the paint scuffed. After multiple interactions you should be able to gather enough pieces to assemble the table. At that point you'll discover that the pieces don't fit together well. For instance, the bottoms of the shelves will fall out since the fit is so poor that they aren't supported on all four sides. These aren't the hassles you should have to deal with when you have a baby on the way."
1,Arrived BROKEN,"We received this as a gift for our baby shower. When we opened the box, one of the legs was cracked. We will be returning and not exchanging for the same item."
1,"Stay Away, Awful Item","This is an awful piece. It is cheaply made, unsafe, and completely not worth the price.I was appalled when I started to put this together. The pieces are not made to fit together well, and the entire unit felt like it was built in shop class. I WOULD NEVER TRUST MY CHILD ON THIS ITEM.Stay away, that's my advice"
5,"History of Art, Revised, Janson","I purchased this book to prepare for an art certification exam. I used this test back in 1984 while earning an art degree. It traces the history of art from the Ancient World to the Modern Art. It has four sections stating the primary sources which serve as a self review. The illustrations are beautiful, and the text contains plenty of interesting facts and descriptions of the art and their meanings. I found the typeface size slightly small, but it is clear and precise. The book weighs seven lbs. and it has 1,032 pages. It is a hardback and it comes in its own hardcover pocket."
5,"I'm just a casual player, but love these cards",These cards make card-playing more fun ... they have a great quality feel and lightness that is a joy to use!
1,what a disappoinment,"i have no idea why, but i have been wanting to read this book for quite a while. i finally bought the book and started reading it right away. it is now in it's bag with the reciept waiting to be returned!!! i read 3 of the stories and i don't know if it is just me but i just don't get it. what is it about this book that i missed?!?!? i actually struggled to get thru each of the 3 stories that i read. i don't want to say that i am super DEEP but i usually like and understand books with deeper meanings but i failed with this book. i still think i will buy ROCK SPRINGS because i really want to experience a Richard Ford book."
2,a dud,"Ford is really straining this time. The labor shows in almost every sentence. This book is full of fakery and contrivance, and it's dead at the core."
5,"Twinlab L-Methionine, 500mg 30 cap","I have been buying this at the local health food store & it is a wonderful product. It does for me exactly what I need it for, however the cost locally is getting to be more than what I can afford. I am now able to buy the product again since the price is affordable to me. I love the product & really missed it when I was not able to afford to buy it. Great product at a great cost & very speedy service."
3,"Good info, ragged book","The information is good and I received the book on time. The book itself had several pages that were irregularly cut and some pages have stickers on them that look like some kind of tracking number. Others just have plain white stickers like they are covering up something but they aren't. The edges of several pages have stains, like spilled coffee or something.I received a note from the company, with my order, regarding the book's ""new condition"" and ""minor imperfections"", saying they would issue a partial credit to my account. I don't know if they did - I haven't checked. I will keep the book because it is useable and frankly, it's just too much of a pain to bother with returning it.I have purchased many books and products from Amazon and this is the first time I have been disappointed!"
3,so-so read,"If you like greek mythology you'll probably appreciate this modern twist.I'd recommend this book if you're looking for something light and humourous. This certainly wasn't an ""I can't stop reading it's so good"" kind of book."
1,DISAPPOINTING,"Zeus and Hera were amusing and enjoyable. Armond was a hunk and the love scenes were hot. But Callie got on my nerves. I thought she was portrayed as much too naive and childish for a grown woman, especially one who is pregnant and was not a virgin when the child was conceived and who is obsessed with the gorgeous Armond's bod. Perhaps her charm was intended to be child-like innocence. If so, it didn't work for me. And, her vocabulary! Give me one good DAMN instead of her wimpy ""dang"". I won't be in a hurry to purchase any more Kathleen Nance books."
3,Might be too violent for the little ones,"Based on some of the reviews I read here, I bought this movie for my four year old daughter because she is obsessed with the ""old school"" Mothra.The production is pretty well done and I pre-screened only the first half of the movie (my mistake) before letting her watch it. She looooved it until the end when the wacked-out Ghidrah 2 or whatever it is ""killed"" the mom Mothra and started biting the baby Mothra and gallons of yellow blood started pouring out.She became very upset and didn't like it much after that. :-0I would not let kids under age ten or so watch this movie because of this one sequence."
3,Pleasant and colourfull monster movies,"Gratefull monster movies, with a suberb cinematography full of Japanese colours, and a good music. Perhaps too childhood, but with an interesting ecologist subtext."
4,Bible Trivia,These are very nice and I think the kids in my family will enjoy using them. It's nice to shop online.
2,"Very short in lenght, not that great","This dvd only lasts 43 minutes, not enough time to ever really get things going. Not very in depth, a quick skim over things, what is shown is pretty but I've seen much better elsewhere. Something like this should be a least 90 minutes to really be worth the money. The cdrom that comes with it only works on windows xp, so if you don't have that, then the 2nd disc won't work. Look into other avenues like Jacque C. stuff or things made by National Geographic for much better, more extenisve coverage. Not to say this is horrible, just too short."
5,Best Underwater Video ever!,"This is an important piece of work. If you care about the planet, check it out. I went to Fiji many years ago and saw the most amazing underwater sights. I have never forgotten the vibrant coral colors and abundant sea life. This DVD captures what I saw on what I think of as the most incredible sight I have ever seen in my life. You may just not believe your eyes."
2,"""Coral Reef ""or ""Let's go Diving""?","This was disappointing because the potential was there to do some wonderful work. Like many of these films, it becomes about the people making the film instead of the fascinating subject it pretends to show. I, personnaly, think there should be as little as possible human depiction in these nature films. If I am buying a film on Coral Reef, I do not want to see diving gear, boats, people plotting courses etc..."
4,Very Satisfied,We are very happy with the video. The graphics and music is awesome! I found it very entertaining as well as educational. Thank you.
5,coral reef adventure,"This DVD was very educational. The water was so clear, like you were almost there. The music was fabulous. It was also great that I could take it to others to show on there computer. I bought the DvD for my college Marine Bio. student. He was very interested in it and would like to get in touch with the film makers of the DvD. He would like to get a grant and work with them. It was just great."
2,Coral Reef,"I was very disappointed with this video. I was looking forward to seeing footage of coral reefs on the ocean floor, but what they gave was an ecological view of what happens when ""man"" doesn't take care of what is there. I'm always looking for good educational videos. If I had been teaching ecology, that would be one thing, but I was looking for live footage of coral reefs."
1,it's okay,I thought it would be about coral reefs... truly beautiful places. Instead it is about people and their quests....Not what I thought... will probably give this DVD away.
4,One of the best single novels from the Star Trek universe.,"Back in early 1980's when Pocket books started issuing Star Trek novels, (even before they numbered them), Black Fire stood out as one of the best. Based on the then new premise of Spock as a savior of the Enterprise and the Federation.Brilliantly written, Black Fire stands out still in my mind as an exceptional rendition of a Stra Trek story (even after reading several hundred Star Trek universe novels over the years)Buy it if you can find it."
1,Dissapointing.,"I'm a big Star Trek fan, but I didn't really like this book at all. I didn't even finish it, because reading it felt like the piece of metal that was wedged into Spock's back. And I know that the ST novels are set outside the regular Star Trek continuity, but the jump from Original Enterprise to first movie Enterprise in just a few months after an onboard explosion? Give me some credit.I'm planning to release my copy via BookCrossing at a movie theatre after Star Trek Nemesis opens, so I hope it'll end up with someone who'll like it more than I did."
3,Needs the text and translation!,"If this disc came with the text and translation for the chants, I would give it five stars. The description of the history of such chants is a good introduction, and the recording itself is crisp and clear.However, if you don't already know a lot about chants or don't know Latin (mine's too rusty), the disc is little more than beautiful singing. If that's all you're after, I'd easily recommend this disc, but the text and translation are important enough to me that their absence is worth two stars.Maybe the text and translations are available somewhere on the internet - I haven't checked yet."
2,Seven Chakras & Elements by Alan Roubik,"I had expected more of a relaxation kind of music. It's OK, but would not have purchased if I had known better."
5,GREG'S CD IS GREAT!!!,"I am a big fan of Greg Evigan!Greg is a great musician and singer!!!He is a very talented man and he has such a beautiful voice!!!I love this CD and I have 3 copies(2 autographed from his fan club,CA,).My favourite songs are: ""Make You Stay"" and ""Change"",but I love every song!!!GREG YOU WERE GREAT ON YOUR ""LIVE MUSIC PERFORMANCE"" ON THE CRUISE!!!!!!!!!I hope to listen to soon your new CD!!!Fiorella"
4,Great Biner,I was very surprised at the quality and how nice this biner was i love it. Defiantly recommend this product.
4,Carabiner - Black Diamond,"Solid product, Highly recommended. I purchased this item for climbing and for use with my light-weight pack hammock. Completely satisfied."
2,Great for ONE day!,"The unit worked well for the first day. The following morning I plugged it in to wash another item and nothing. I think the GFI is faulty. While it's a pain to repack and drop off at the Post Office, Amazon is so customer friendly it's easy to return. I have to hunt out another smilar unit but will not risk another Campbell Hausfeld."
2,First use = GREAT! Second use = Blew a fuse!,"First time I used this pressure washer it was wonderful and easy to use. I cleaned my entire house. But my finger was numb for one month afterwards!Second time I used this pressure washer, I turned it on and it immediately blew a fuse and now it doesn't work anymore! Must get fixed!"
1,My worst purchase on Amazon,"First off, I received an open-box item instead of a new one. There was a soapy residue all over the washer. When I hooked up this flimsy machine, the connection to the water gun was not working correctly. The instructions that come with it are lousy to say the least. The bonus car kit looks like something from a dollar store. I tried everything and the brass (or brass imitation) fitting was just no good. I cannot recommend this item at all. The nightmare returning it with UPS was even worse. It seems like a deal, but you're getting less than what you pay for on this one."
1,Bought two both worked once then died.,It is simple enough to say that if you buy this you are wasting your money. I found the device worked once and then after stored it id not. I took it to a local shop that wanted 150.00 to fix it so I just got a new one from Amazon. Same story a year later. Do not waist your cash buy a real gas washer.
5,the basics on liberalism,"I read this book in 1979. It is a classic. Mr. Burham's observations on liberalism have helped me to understand the liberal mindset through the intervening years. Some chapters will not help the modern reader, as events have overtaken them, but the analysis of the liberal mistake is still valid. Mankind will not be made perfect by laws or governments. The world is not imperfect because we have failed to write and enforce our laws correctly. No system of carrots and sticks designed by man or government will replace the dictum: teach them correct principles. Read also Michael Oakeshott on civil association."
5,David DeAngelo approved,"I first heard about Marc Jacobs from listening to David DeAngelo's monthly interview series (October). I went out to the mall to get a whiff of this stuff and it is incredible (If there was only a way to smell stuff over the internet :) ). If you could smell confidence then this is what it would smell like. It smells very different but warm and comforting, or as David D would put it...different in a positive way. Its a serious upgrade from the Nautica I have been using due to it being a very unique smell. This is how a man should smell."
1,Old Butter Scent,"This was one of the the worst cologne's I have ever purchased.I purchased Marc Jacobs Bang which I like.Then like a fool I order a large bottle of Marc Jacobs reg. cologne with out testing it first.I have put this on my wrist a few times thinking I might change my mind,but no way.This stuff smells like old butter left out to long in warm weather.Its fine for the guys who like it,but this is not for me.I think this crap stinks. Rod."
2,One hit from the whole album,"Although Joyce ""Fenderella"" Irby has a great, distinctive voice, she was much better served as the lead vocal for Klymaxx than opting for her solo. This is her first solo release, and I think I would have prefered that she stuck with Klymaxx. This album has exactly one song that I like, ""I'll Be There"", and it's a duet. ""I'll Be There"" is not a song that people remember by title so much, but almost everyone will eventually recall hearing it after listening to the song. If you don't mind the typical synthetic and disco-esque sounds of the '80's, then you may enjoy some of the other tracks on this album, but for me, I think I'll stick with Klymaxx. If you're not familiar with Klymaxx, then perhaps you'll just skip through this one altogether."
2,"""Terrible""-complete garbage",Recieved it promptly that's about the only good thing I have to say about these lights. I recieved them and it took me a while to install them because I had to go to a automotive bay on base to install them. Once installed I found out that the Projector lights were wired backward. It took forever to install them and I did not want to have to uninstall them. I came home to check out the return policy only to find out they (Autoparts Train) only gives you a month to try out the product from the date that it was shipped in order to find out if it is going to work properly. Needless to say that was very DISSAPPOINTING! I WAS NOT HAPPY! I'm still trying to figure out what I am going to do with these lights.
5,SIMPLY EXCELLENT,"Simply an excellent book. This book convinced me of the importance of loving God with my mind and showed me practical steps I could take to do so. For example, it got me to cut down my TV watching and set goals for completing certain books withing certain periods of time. As a result, I have grown deeply in my knowledge of and hence love for God. I have also grown towards becoming the person he intends for me to be.This book is a must read for every Christian today--especially in light of the huge problem of anti-intellectualism plaguing the church today."
5,BEST EVER ON THIS TOPIC!,"I have read just about every book published regarding developing a Christian mind and worldview and this is by far the best. I have told every Christian friend I have to get this book and read it immediately. The final chapter is particularly good because it has several outstanding practical suggestions to help encourage local churches in developing their people in discipling their minds. I plan to teach this book in my Church as soon as I can. If you only read one Christian book in the next five years, it should be this one. Thank God for JP Moreland!"
2,WASN'T WHAT I EXPECTED,"This book was not what I expected it to be. To me it was alot of information that most hair stylist could tell you. The book was ok, but it just wasn't all that. Oprah's hair stylist has a book with much more information than this one. What really disappointed me was the fact her book didn't recommend what she thought was the better products to use and more helpful for your hair, nor did she mention (naming the products) that was the worst stuff for your hair. I was sought of disappointed after reading it."
5,How About That.........,"I would like to see if the author can ""HOOK"" my hair up like the lady on the cover of her book. I might not have a lot of hair but I sure hope she can work with what I have. I TRULY enjoyed your book Mrs. Moss. I'm from Mesquite, Texas and you will see me soon. Keep up the good work and may the Lord continue to bless you with this talent. Thanks for such a informative book about ""MY"" hair. When I see you I will congratulate you personally."
3,A TREASURE,"THIS BOOK IS WHAT I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR FOR A LONG TIME. FINALLY SOMEONE WROTE A BOOK THAT TOLD ME WHAT I NEED TO KNOW ABOUT ABOUT MY HAIR TYPE,AND IT WAS EASY TO UNDERSTAND. I CAN NOT AFFORD TO GO TO THE BEAUTY PARLOR ALL THE TIME. THIS BOOK TAUGHT ME SOME THINGS I CAN DO FOR MYSELF AT HOME. ALL OF MY LIFE I WAS TOLD THAT I HAD BAD HAIR BECAUSE IT IS VERY KINKY.THANK YOU MRS. MOSS FOR WRITING A BOOK THAT WILL HELP SISTA'S LIKE MYSELF OUT. I AM LEARNING TO LOVE THE HAIR THAT GOD HAS BLESSED ME WITH AND I THANK HIM FOR ALLOWING YOU TO WRITE A BOOK THAT WILL HELP BLACK WOMEN DECIDE THAT IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT TYPE OF HAIR YOU HAVE ( ALL HAIR TYPES CAN BE VERSATILE AND BEAUTIFUL.)"
4,Healthy Hair Care Tips for Today's Black Woman,This book had great hair care tips for Today's Black Woman. My daughter's hair is healthier and so is mine!!!
2,Basic common sense,"I was very disappointed with this book. What I read, I already knew and learned from a magazine. The reason I did not give it one star is because the information in the book was true but plain old basic common sense."
2,"Ok, but...",This is very much like a textbook rather than a guideline for tips and information for the test. I'm reading it but finding myself confused rather than refocused. We'll see if that changes but this is my experience so far...
2,WARNING,"I like to think that I would love this camera, IF I had it yet. I ordered the thing on the 7th of September, paid for two day shipping, and still haven't recieved it on the 15th. Just let this be a warning to you the consumer. Read what you are paying for. Make sure 2-day shipping acutally means 2-day shipping. If not, write an email, request an apology and a refund, and if all else fails take your business elsewhere."
4,Perfect for the Windy City or if you are not Mary Poppins!!!,"Great little device to keep your tie in place during those windy days of the year. I like my tie to stay in place and not become an appendage flying all over the place as I walk. This tool it's job well. I do not like tie clips and this is practically invisible, just remember to take them out before washing. You get 5 in the package in case you forget a few times."
3,"Maybe it works, but not for newer PS3's","I was excited to have a cooler, more efficient PS3. I already lost one PS3 to heat exhaustion. So I ordered this for my new 160GB PS3 model, well somewhere along the line Sony changed the layout of the PS3 backside. This product will not fit on newer PS3's. Not sure when the change was made, so I'm not sure which models it may or may not work with. It definitely fits my dead 40gb PS3 with the hardware PS2 compatibility, but not my new 160GB PS3. So three stars, because I don't know if or how this product works, only that I can't use it."
3,air cooler,"This product seams to work alright. My PS3's emergency fans have not operated since I attached this. Very quiet, can hardly tell if its blowing any air at all. But you have to plug it in separately and turn it on and off yourself. It is not an automatic thing."
4,Perfect for my needs,"I read some bad reviews about generic brands, so I went with Kingston for the memory upgrade for my Sidekick 3, and it has worked out great. Don't know what would make this a five star, I mean, it's memory, it works."
2,Don't expect to get what you ordered.,I ordered the 2GB expecting to get 2 gigs on the memeory card. The card is actually 1 gig. I'm very disappointed in the product. I will never order this brand again.
2,Not what I was expecting.,"I think this book has a place for a certain niche, but I unfortunatly am not a part of it. The tone is angry almost whiney, I think that there are certain claims in the book that are valid but they are often substaintiated with a single anectodte. These anectodtes on occassion ""prove"" to the claim, but most times I felt like the author didn't fully prove his argument. He repeadtly looked at only the side of the argument he see's failing to understand why others may hold a different point of view. Not a page turner, which is unfortunate becuase I was excited about this book."
2,Easy Money,"This book provoked a strange reaction in me. I read it quite quickly, mostly because it annoyed me so much! Strange I know.I think I was just curious to see if the author could come up with something original. In fairness, he did in the end, just about. To sum, bar the last three chapters where there is some attempt to introduce some original thought this book was extremely disappointing. The author basically demonstrates how the vagueness of language can be misunderstood. Some revelation! He picks a politicians statements and dissects it, pointing out the inherent lack of logic. Ad nauseum! Many people, in my opinion, would spot the flawed logic being demonstrated without any explanation whatsoever. I dont know, I too am surprised by the rating, not a patch on Freak......"
4,Great work.,"This is a great opening book to Logic. It is really helpful in opening our eyes to some of the hidden dangers to language. I wish that more people could be aware of these topics; it would make us better voters and informed citizens. The only drawback is that the author is a little full of himself. It is a little irritating at times but as pompous as he is, he is correct in my book with what he has to say."
3,Misdemeanors Against Logic,"This book is a fairly interesting read but the points it make may be obvious to readers who are careful thinkers or debators. There were few, if any, surprising points. Still, it may be worth reading for people who do not think about such things often or who would like to be ""reminded"" of the points contained in the book. It is clearly written and easy to understand. In addition, the book is a bit more interesting when it attempts to explain the reasons why individuals and entities commit their ""crimes against logic"" in the course of a debate. Indeed, being able to discern the motivation for the crime is probably a rarer skill (in the heat of a debate) than being able to recognize that a crime has occurred. Overall, an interesting read but it would not be on the top of my recommendation list."
3,Excellent Ingredients That Are Half-baked.,"Whyte has the right recipe and excellent ingredients, but it's half-baked. His tone reminds me of high school seniors who know it all but have almost no fund of experience. His book has this adolescent quality to it.Still, the part about tolerance is worth the price of the book. Advocating tolerance truly does beg the question. I'm keeping the book for this alone."
2,NOT Stainless Steel,"I bought the remaining stock of these with the apparent misconception that ""S/S"" meant stainless steel. They were most certainly not."
4,I like the player,"I wanted to counter the other review.I just bought this. I am very pleased with this purchase. I use it for promotional pusposes, so I wanted a sturdy product. I like it's very long battery life. It comes with all the cords you need, many do not. It has a swivel screen, which is cool.Very good, very sturdy, good price"
1,Nearly Ruined My Glassware,"I bought this detergent with high hopes and was very disappointed with the results. Not only did it leave junks of the detergent behind, but it left a film on the glassware, and seemed to etch my glasses as well. I thought for sure I would have to replace my glassware! Needless to say, I tried it a few times thinking the next time would be better but it wasn't and I ended up tossing the detergent and going back to liquid Cascade. Only after a lot of intense scrubbing and several cycles with Cascade did my glassware return to its pre-Seventh Generation condition."
1,This doesn't work!!,"I have a box that I am ready to throw away, after using half a box and having to rewash the dishes EVERY SINGLE TIME!! It is truly the worst dishwashing detergent ever!"
2,Not dissolving in our well water,"This product is just not working for us. We use our own well water which gives us no problems with anything else, but this product is not dissolving and we are left with lots of white specks on most of the dishes.To test, we ran a load of dishes through twice with this produce and still had the white bits after the 2nd load. Then, without changing the load or cleaning anything, we popped one of those cascade tablets into it for the 3rd load. Everything came out clean and looking good."
2,Enviro-friendliness is only reason for second star,"As another reviewer noted, this detergent left all of our dishes and utensils covered with a white residue. Perhaps it's because our water is hard. Nonetheless, we have to stop using it. Back to Palmolive. Unfortunately, not as eco-friendly (though more so than some other big-name brands), it cleans better."
1,Hard water? Don't bother.,"This soap did not dissolve in our hard water. It left dirt and soap all over the dishes. I hate to waste an entire box of soap as well as the water to wash a load of dishes, but that's what happened. Ecover seems fine with the hard water."
3,average product--leaves residue,"I was disappointed that this detergent did not clean better. I have been using for awhile, since I had to buy a case of it from Amazon. It seems to have trouble getting really dirty or greasy dishes clean, and leaves a residue on the items in the top shelf. My silverware often still has bits of food on them. Even my stainless steel cookware does not get sparkling--it leaves spots on them too, with bits of food. I wish it worked better, because I appreciate the environmental impact, however, it's not saving the environment if I have to re-wash 1/3 of the load."
1,What a waste!,"I tried and really liked other Seventh Generation products, but this was just terrible. Yes, I have hard water. I filled both cups like the instructions said to do with hard water and also used a rinse aid (instructions recommended for hard water) but it left white scum all over everything! I was very disappointed. I wanted to use something eco friendly, but at this rate I'll be using my electrosol again."
2,Not enjoyable and not educational,"I would have been okay with not having fun if the game was at least educational, but I honestly don't feel like I learned anything I hadn't already. Without giving too much away, I was incredibly physically uncomfortable the entire time. It was incredibly unrealistic--the regions being completely cut off from one another without ""traveling"" seemed silly for something that was supposed to be a ""society"". There were a few good nuggets, most of which involved bargaining and compromise with other groups, but all in all it was nothing we hadn't learned in everyday life. I was bored almost the whole time--not because I was being lazy, but because I literally could do nothing. I came away frustrated and annoyed to have wasted so much time on something so unnecessary. If you're an educator, make sure to read through both manuals and really think it through before doing this project. If you are required to take part, just do the best you can."

4,Great Read,This is a great read. I've had this book for a few years and I'm always referring back to it from.
1,HORRIFIED!!,"well, i must say, form the outlook, thgis book seemed to be a good read, but as soon as i picked it up, i had to put it down in the name of the Allmighty! WOW! i dont know how something like this is allowed to be published - this woman encourages interaction with demons and encourages 'chanting' and so-called 'sacred incantations'. i would not reccoment that anyone read this book. it is the handywork of a common witch, and i want nothing to do with it!Be Blessed Peace&Love Yaa Nana Nyamakeye Sankofa"
5,Simply Praise & Worship Personified,"Words cannot describe how good these two CD's/DVD's are. ACT I allows you to knock down the ""Giants"" in your life and then give thanks in prasing ""God"". ACT II gets you into several testimonials with ""God Is"" and ""It's Your Time"". And all the other songs just complement these songs with perfection. God is good and all the time and you can feel his presence in these two CD/DVD's."
2,No Joy in Mudville,"My favorite song here is ""Valium Waltz"", though I would have preferred it to be the exception rather than the rule. This album isn't bad exactly, its just not what I'd hoped for from these guys. Where are the tunes? Where are the hooks? Where are the clever lyrics? Even their early indie albums had catchy choruses, so I don't buy that comparison. And the poppier albums balanced Miller's tales of woe with perky tunes. Murky and mopey, too little of this grabs me. I'm with the reviewer who hopes for a live album next. I saw them in concert just before this came out and they still rock with a raucous abandon that brings out a giddy joy in their best material that sometimes gets lost in the studio."
1,Pretty poor book,"Lack of temps, surfaces, firing schedules, and insight. I found nothing useful about this book. It does not live up to its claims at all. Very disappointing for me, and I would never recommend this to artists at any level."
1,Not very useful,I find the materials covered in this book very theoretical and tangential and thus are not very useful.
2,Bit Overreaching,"I felt Mr. Grandin had some very interesting insights into U.S. history in Latin America and its relevance on current administration policy and our involvement in Iraq. I thought that the background on Nicaragua and El Salvador, in particular, was very insightful as was his description of the ""PR Campaigns"" that have been waged domestically. I found Mr. Grandin's linkage of the militarists and the Christian right to be an interesting perspective. However, particularly towards the end of the book I felt that the stereotypes and judgments in the book were overreaching and that Mr. Grandin offered plenty of criticisms of U.S. foreign policy without offering any meaningful solutions."
2,Utterly bias,"This book provides a view of American Corporateness in Latin America. Although the book sheds light upon particular injustice perpetrated by the American government, Grandin villifies American Evangelicals and Catholics in Latin America citing these groups as simply oppressors. This short-sightedness is simply not comprehensive in scope and it needs to be carefully edited in order to paint a more truthful picture."
3,"Short show, no great sound, no great video: average","In order some reviews and the great announcement ""high def video"" I expected to get that. Nop, no big deal.Tha songs and the performance are just ok, but the show is less than average (all the time with the lights like a sunny day, always on, not a good idea, seems like a children party).The sound it's right. Mr Plant was the best singer of all times, ever...many years ago."
3,A let down from Robert Plant,"Not at all what I expected. I expected more old Zepplin and more of the Plant songs that we all lovebut surprise, they weren't on this one and If they were they were changed up and ruined!"
4,Beautiful Bassinet,I love this bassinet. It you are looking for something beautiful and unique this is the one. If you're wondering what the color Ecru is like it's darker then egg shell and lighter then tan.The bassinet itself is white and the pleating and bows are white. The color looks like an ivory wedding invitation. I hope that helps because it's hard to tell on the screen. The assembly was easy. I did it myself at 7 months pregnant. You can go online and order extra sheets at Badger's website. They only come in white. You can't find round sheets at the the store.I shopped around and this was the best price.I did have a problem with my first order.One of the bassinet bars was broken. I contacted Amazon and they picked up the broken order and replaced it with a new one in days. I was very happy with the service. They could probably avoid shipping breakage if it was packed a little better. Everything worked out and I love this bassinet!
1,Barbie W-T cheap,"I got the Barbie Walkie Talkies for Christmas from my Granny. They don't work. I was very excited, but they are bad. Lots of static (that's what Mom says). I couldn't hear my best friend unless she was in the same room as me."
2,Dissapointed,"We got these for our daughter for Christmas and were very dissapointed in them. Voices are hard to hear and turning up the volume just turns up the static! Also the buttons that make Barbie talk get bumped if stored in a toy box and wear out the batteries even faster, not to mention how anoying it sounds! I had better walkie talkies when I was a kids! I suggest spending the extra money and getting the Motorola or other brand family radios."
5,sundancer cheyenne series,Another beautiful book it was another book even though other books I've read have been written by other authors this is another beautiful story that I couldnt put down this another book that makes you feel your there with them and another great movie story I didnt want the book to end.
1,"PRETTY, BUT CHEAP",THE SHOE BROKE AT THE ARCH AFTER THE SECOND WEAR. (31 DAYS AFTER BEING DELIVERED TO ME)
5,A practical pan for everyday cooking!,"I bought this pan for the hope of having a great stainless steel pan for everyday cooking and I am glad I did. It is very practical to use for quick cooking, it distributes heat evenly and quickly yet the handle doesn't heat up and it's user friendly since it's not heavy. I love using it in searing meat and cook the sauce after searing the meat in the pan. It is a very good buy that's why I bought other sauce pans with the same tri-ply material by Calphalon.It's a kitchen basic if you love to cook!"
1,"Lost out on $165,000 in Fantasy 5 using this book!","I purchased Gail's ""How to Wheel a Fortune"" years ago and decided to buy ""Lotto Wheel 5 to Win"" only because there were more wheels for the 5/39 game...and how sorry I am that I did! First of all the formulas for wheeling 12 numbers for a 3 of 4 win guarantee in the first book I purchased were NOT the same 3 of 4 win formulas found in this book. Secondly, if I had known the formulas were different I would have stuck with the ""How to Wheel a Fortune"" because I lost out on winning $165,000 in Michigan's Fantasy 5 game on March 30, 2005! I wheeled the same 12 numbers but the results were different in each book. I wish the author had included a note or something about the different formulas in this book as opposed to her previous books. I am so angry that I bought it. Which is why I gave it a 1!"
5,Outstanding Work of Audio Art!,This is an incredible collection of audio gems by the songmaster Jimmy Webb. The songwriting and production is unsurpassed. Cloudman and Asleep On The Wind will bring tears to your eyes. These are songwriting masterpieces; such beautiful imagery and sound that Jimmy has created in this amazing album. Very highly recommended Webb.
4,Essential for Webb fans,"While Webb fans love both his songs and his performances, the general public is mostly aware of this amazing tunesmith's covers from artists as diverse as Glen Campbell's country versions of ""Wichita Lineman"" to The Fifth Dimension's soulful ""Up, Up and Away.""Only one song from ""Land's End"" received a cover of significance. That's ""Crying in my Sleep"", which appeared on Art Garfunkel's ""Watermark,"" which is a collection dedicated to Webb's work.""Crying in my Sleep"" is one of the best songs on this CD, but add to that, ""Lady Fits Her Blue Jeans,"" which deserved more attention than it got, and the amazing orchestral ""Lands End"" closing with ""Asleep on the Wind"" which is a lovely story about birds that never touch the land.""Land's End"" probably isn't the best introduction to Webb's work, if you are only familiar with other artists' covers, but it's essential for any Webb fan who loves both Jimmy's performance and his orchestrations."
2,Two bad adapters is enough,"I purchased this adapter as a replacement for the original. The first one lasted less than a year and the second one less than six months. Each time the plastic connector on the end that plugs into the camera fell apart. I do plug the camera in about once a week, but this seems to be shoddy workmanship. The only reason I didn't give it one star is because it seemed to work fine before the connectors fell apart."
4,Just What I Needed / DCR-SR47,"I hate to think of any purchase as bein' ""luck"", but from what other reviews have said, I can only assume that's what happened. Some people said they thought their camera was listed, but it didn't work, others just had it not work, etc, etc. I specifically saw my model number, though, and as it turns out, it worked. So if you have a DCR-SR47, this should work just fine!(My wife got it fast, too, in time for her to deliver our baby, so I was especially happy seein' as how I was deployed overseas....)"
3,a tad dry...,"This book seems to be a bit outdated. Some stories were interesting,while some did not make sense to me at all. To tell you the truth,this book did not seem to measure up to PAPERBACK LIBRARYstandards. The clue is in the full title- TANDEM. It was lifted tobe made into a PAPERBACK LIBRARY book. In most cases- SMART.But in this case- NOT SO SMART. Cool cover, though, which didnot have anything to do with the stories."
4,Not enough,"Good movie, I'd say it's worth watching if not buying. Funny, and they do try to work the satire angle by having the girls as ""go-go"" dancers, not strippers, although this cuts down on the nudity. And, that's the biggest problem with the movie, three hot babes, and only one gets naked--although she does so a few times. She's blonde, she's hot, but she still only one out of three. The acting, the writing, the stunts all work and the movie actually makes sense (in it's own world, of course)as opposed to a few large buget, over acted theatrical releases of late. I'd rather watch a cheap bad movie that's funny and has nudity than an expensive bad movie any day."
4,Sting reinvented,"Great version of famous works of Sting with orchestral arrangement, giving new life to the successes of always. Great quality record."
5,Great experience,"The book, ""Paper Airplane"" came in excellent shape and arrived when it was expected. All in all it was a great experience."
2,"Good choice for the lover of ""ALL"" things about FILMS","This book was a disappointment to me because I think I expected more info about the stars. Honestly for whatever reason, I expected something like Hollywood Babylon. However, if you are a person who enjoys the intricacies behind Film Making---this is a book for you. But if you lean towards the more personal human side of film making, look further."
3,Fairly good not great,"This knight that Raven has loved since the age of 12 is not all that! I felt the black knight was every bit as dispictable as Ravens disgusting room. She begs him for help so she won't be forced to marry a creep who she feels killed her sister, (his first wife) and he refuses her. Then after the wedding he decides he'll sneek in her room and rob her husband of her virginity! Raven doesn't mind because she would rather have him than her groom. The black knight then readies himself to leave and let Raven face a furious husband alone. He comes to his senses and decides to help her flee to become his leeman. Be still my heart."
3,"Not the greatest, but pretty good...","Okay, so Connie Mason isn't the most ground-breaking of romance novelists. She does crank out books left and right. But she's a pretty good writer and this is the kind of book worth your money or the time getting it out of the library if you're looking for a good weekend escape novel. I liked Drake and Raven and the general plot line, love scenes were fairly hot, the emotions were pretty genuine. I'm a sucker for medieval novels in general so ""Black Knight"" was worth it for me to read, just for some fun. Don't want to spend the money? Find it at a used book store. ""Black Knight"" is a fun read with a pretty hot hero and I can put some of the historic discrepancies aside for those facts alone..."
4,The only reason I gave this book a 4 star is,"because the hero/heroine names bothered me. Raven and Drake, almost on the cutely coincidental side. You wouldn't think it would get to you but their names are together through all 400 pages. She needed more diverse names for me. Don't even get me started on the villain's name. Needless to say, I thought the where's waldo scenerio was a children's book little did I know I'd be playing it here. I read this book years ago when it first came out and just reread it. It's still a good read despite the names."
2,Much cheaper in store,"I bought the same strip at my local store for 6.99 + tax = 7.67. The only difference is that the cord is 3 feet long, otherwise all the same specifications. On amazon, I couldn't find 3 feet long cord strip. So, if 3 feet is ok for you, I guess you can check offline in your local store before buying from Amazon. I guess this is the first time that I found on Amazon overpriced. And maybe this fact has enthused me to write my first review. Otherwise Amazon rocks, I buy so many other stuff from Amazon! Happy Shopping!"
4,great multi use grill,"We bought this as a gift for my husbands father. I chose this one because it was both a grill and griddle and most importantly, had removable dishwasher safe plates. He has used it a few times and says he loves it, it is easy to use and easy to clean."
4,My tables are too thick for these clips.,These are great clips but my picnic tables are too thick for them to be effective. I'm still hunting for a solution...
2,Was shocked by reviews but was to late to cancel order,"I didn't feel it was necessary to read the reviews before I purchased the watch~ this is Disney and Tinker Bell!. The word ""Flirt"" didn't bother me either because Tinkerbell was a flirt. Wow after reading the full product description with hot and saucy on the wrist band I was shocked that this watch is under the children's section. I needed this for my grand daughter's birthday. Like it was said before, I could have given this five stars but HOT and Saucy for a young girl, oh no!"
5,Misleading title...,"...This book has nothing to do with nudity. The gist of the story is actually about a statue that is lost, and so the way the title can be interpreted is No Nudes is Good News. The content of the book tops all the funny books. The book is hysterical in its own way; the story is very satirical and has many twists and turns. Any one who reads it will enjoy it. :)"
2,anti aging magnetic therepy eye mask,"The eye mask is not the same as the one on the picture. It is much smaller. More importantly, the magnets all stick together and it is almost impossible to get them apart and in the right place. Would not recommend."
4,good band,"Heard them in person, which led to this purchase. Doesn't include a lot of the songs I like, but they are a very good band. Go see them in person, if you get the chance."
3,Pretty straight forward RTS,Generic RTS set in the Star Wars universe. Nothing new here. It is based on the old Age Of Empires setup just with Star Wars. Recommended for Star Wars fans but not recommended for RTS fans because you will get bored quickly because it has been done before. There are many other RTS games that are much better.
3,So-so,"The game is, well, so-so. I feel as though some of these comments are obviously those of the producers', etc. There seems to be two kinds of reviews here: 1. Honost--giving few stars, or several to be kind or open-minded. And 2. Dishonost--all out ""THIS IS THE BEST GAME I EVER PLAYED!!!"" Ah, yeah, RIGHT! Surrrre...Anyway, the game isn't bad. It can be a fun game if, like me, you're a big Star Wars nut. But as some reviewers have said here, if you've played AOK, it might be a waste of time (and money!)"
2,"game out in 2001-2002, still the graphics are horrible","it lags a lot in graphics. the gameplay is neither good. interesting if you want to know more about the Star Wars stories from Episodes I, II, IV, V, & VI.i'd suggest to wait for the new RTS ""Star Wars Empire at War"" coming in 2005 made by the creators of ""Command & Conquer Generals"" (i'm not talking about publisher EA or Electronic Arts, i'm talking about the once Westwood Studios' programmers)"
3,Just download on iTunes or Mp3 players,Just because it is a greatest hits doesn't mean it's really good. I should have listened to most of the songs on my iTunes before I purchased this CD. It's not worth the $$$.
3,Great--but not definitive--List of Best of Human League,"It's always nice to see a really deserving band--especially one from the early-to-mid 80's--receive some 21st century recognition. I love every cut on this album, but could never recommend it to someone unfamiliar with their work as the definitive collection. The failure to include ""Seconds"" is nothing short of sabotage by the marketing manager of Human League's record company. Buy the original remastered DVD copies and skip this inadequate set list altogether."
5,Terrific,Really good book I could read it over and over again I especially liked the ending of it and how he came back to her
4,For the working stiffs,Here's an older movie that will leave you laughing. I believe that this was Henry Winkler's breakout film from playing the Fonz for so many years on Happy Days. His deadpan humor is a 180 degree from the Fonz. Michael Keaton's nos-stop mind bending line delivery is funny as heck. Worth watch'n in the dead of night.
3,What happened at Borley Rectory?,"Fictional account trying to explain the mysteries behind Borley Rectory, the most haunted house in England. Originally published in 1941, two years after the rectory burned to the ground under mysterious circumstances."
4,Sweet Case,"This is by far the best cd case I could find. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the outside of the case could be more scratch/scuff resistant. Besides that, it's extremely well made. The hard shell keeps the discs very protected. Little perks like the cleaning cloth are appreciated. Sleeves allow you to place album inserts to keep things organized and presentable. Beautifull product!"
2,Great while it lasted (clip broke),"It was great while it lasted. I can still attach it to my belt with a rubber band, but the plastic surrounding the hole for the metal pin snapped after just 3 months of light use. I found accuracy to be quite good and consistent (when compared to my coworkers models, with my bicycle odometer and counting steps). I'm disappointed it broke so easily."
1,Unreliable & Inaccurate,"At first it appeared to be functioning properly although we had some difficulty determining and then setting our correct stride length. Then, the second time we used it, it said we had walked .90 miles when the GPS on our cell phone said the distance was 3.82 miles. We reset it, walked 20 steps and looked at the display. It read 14 steps. We will return it today."
1,Poor Performance,"I purchased two of these and one does not work at all, and one is not monitoring correctly. I need to return but have thrown away packagining and paperwork."
1,it doesnt work,It doesnt work. I walked for an hour and it calculated that i burned 9 calories. I didnt have time to return it. not worth the return postage either.
5,Great learning tool!,"This is actually very helpful if you're trying to teach phonics to your toddlers! ""Look at the picture- what is it? That's right, a bus! What letter makes the 'buh' sound and also fits right here? That's right, a 'b' makes the 'buh' sound and fits. What sound is next? That's right, 'uh' is the next sound. What letter makes the 'uh' sound and fits? That's right..."" If you work with your tot, they learn the shape and sound of the letter, with hands on activity that helps them learn. Great for school aged kids too to help them remember how to spell words. Great product!"
3,Better for older children,"This is a wonderful way to encourage learning to spell. My only issue is that the letters can easily become lost and are a choking hazard for younger kids in the house. So, it is best to play with this toy WITH your child. Fun and cute. My suggestion, ideal for 4+ years of age."
5,Great for learning lowercase letters and early reading,"Our 3yr son loves these puzzles and can do them fairly quickly. Though he can't spell the words yet, he is gradually learning which letters he needs to for each puzzle and I'm sure will soon learn that ""cat"" spells cat and so on. As others have mentioned, I do wish there was a cover for the letter storage area. We kept the plastic cover from the packaging, but it's flimsy and keeps falling off."
5,My daughter LOVES it!!,My daughter is only 2 an this toy entertains her for an hour! She already knows her letters and so seeing how they go together to make words is WONDERFUL!
2,Splinters,"This toy is built upon a good idea, but executed poorly. I purchased this puzzle and was very excited to use it with my son. However, I realized that the letters were giving him splinters because the wood was peeling off the sides. I returned the toy, quite dissapointed.Additionally, I feel that the letters are a bit difficult to find because they are all in one small spot. The child will have to organize the letters first before spelling. Or, have the patience to sort through the letters to find the one they are looking for. I believe the montessori sandpaper letters will be of higher quality as well as take care of the secondary issue."
4,Loved the toy/not the lid,"We got this toy for our 4th and 5th child, 4 years old and 2 years old. We love the toy, but there was no lid with it. Our other Melissa and Doug Toys have a lid with them. I had to put the letters in a ziploc bag. Other than the no lid, we love playing with this toy, reviewing letters and spelling words."
4,Pretty good,"I like this puzzle set. The only complaint I have is that it comes in a nice wooden box, but there is no lid for where the letters go. It is just an open box..which makes it pretty ackward to store."
5,Best book I ever read!,"This was Merton's favorite book (of his own writing), and my favorite book as well. He was a scholar and a poet, and his essays reflect that: he does not write down to his audience. Merton was that great rarity: an existential mystic. He had incredible insights; his writing had a profound influence on ME. These essays are meant to be disturbing. Written in the Sixties, they are as meaningful today as then."
2,"the product is half-done, requires assembly","Inner plastic boxes do not come as pictured, you need to spend 20 minutes (which adds to the price) to build them and put the white stickers on. After built, they look cheap and not durable. Disappointed, will not buy again, but, perhaps, it will do the job for now (that is why 2 stars, not 1)."
5,Just What I Wanted,"I used to be able to find this product locally at craft stores in my neighborhood, but they no longer carry them. My first place to look was on Amazon.com... I found them and got an even better price than at the store with a coupon. Perfect condition - Brand New, Shipped fast and Just What I Wanted right to my doorstep!Thank you!"
1,Don't be a sucker!!! This movie sucks!!! Horrible!!! Negative 5 stars!!!,"If you find ""Full House"" to be hilarious then you might be entertained by this movie. This movie is painfully unfunny. Whoever gave this movie more than 2 stars is mentally challenged or under the age of 10. Don't get suckered by all the 5 star reviews like we did."
5,A Dog's Breakfast--David Hewlett--funniest this century!,"David Hewlett is very talented as actor, writer, director and comedian. Principally known as MacKay, the arrogant scientist on Stargate Atlantis, has a talented bunch of friends and colleagues supporting him in this really fun movie. Fans of the Stargate shows will recognize many of his co-stars."
4,Good job,"Was quite a funny movie but a shame that Mr. Hewlett was a little too revealing untoward his fans. If you watch the movie you'll know what I mean. Met Paul McGillan in Calgary May 2010 and seemed a little shocked by the movie (rather subtle) but nothing that a little therapy can't cure. 8 out of 10 if you enjoy Dr. Rodney McKay when ever he was a little upset. There is an aspect of SciFi but not really the same as SGA. For those who look forward to the planned SGA movie, A Dogs Breakfast is a nice appetiser. Guess we will have to settle for the appearance on the SGU special as the goodbye role for the brilliant Dr. Rodney McKay."
4,This is a great film,"I loved this film and I can definatley see why it became successful despite being a low budget independent film. It is highly creative, pulling traditional sight gags and slapstick comedy mixed in with some very unexpected (and dark) twists. The humor can be enjoyed by everyone and serves as a good lesson to or about those that are set in their ways and make judgements too quickly. The use of camera angles and sight gags v. expensive special effects is excellent and works very, very well - without being sophmoric, cheesy or corny. And Max steals the show!"
4,Another RARE release from Vania Abreu,"Vania's second CD, not as good as ""Seio de Bahia"" released 3 years earlier. But it was long awaited by me, this lady can sing a ballad like no one else, her delivery is so smooth and natural. She is fabulous. Her style is diametrically opposite from her sister Daniela Mercury. She is directly comparable to Astrud Gilberto, Bebel Gilberto, Lisa Ono and Marisa Monte, and she is better than all of them, this lady is the REAL DEAL. I just can't understand why she does not sing more, her talent is world class, one of the best ever. On this CD I liked 5 tracks, Minha Alma, Beca, Eu Sou A Multidao, O Amor Foi Inventado and Pra Falar De Amor.This CD along with Seio de Bahia are definitely 2 you want in your collection."
3,So So Compilation,"My major interest in this CD was in the selection entitled ""Robin Hood And His Merry Men"" (duration: 4 min, 28 sec), conducted by John Williams, and performed by the London Symphony Orchestra. It turns out that this is a re-issue of the track from Sony Classical SK 62788, 1997. Surprisingly, this performance is poky, ponderous, and prodding. The conducting is, well, somnambulistic. Miking/mixing/processing yields a sonic brick deficient in instrumental nuances while sounding like way too many musicians were shoe horned into the recording studio. As for the rest of the tracks, it's hard to believe, but Silva America offers better compilations! Best to skip this one."
1,Where's the yoga?,"The video has a lot of stretching exercises, but by the time I turned it off in frustration Foster had yet to get to any real yoga poses. Not good instruction on breathing, spine lengthening, etc."
2,"A good stretch, I'd call it beginner.","An intermediate practice normally would include some poses such as Shoulderstand, Wheel, Crane, Headstand, or at least preparation for these. Nope, not here. This is a very nice tape if you want to stretch out thoroughly, but it is definitely at a beginner level."
3,Time to Fly- a review,Time To Fly is number 10 in the series Wild at Heart. Its main character is a girl named Zoe. In the book there are Parrots being smuggled from South America to the Untied States for money. A truck full of birds tips over and releces hundreds into Zoe's little hometown(unfortunatly a large portion of the birds die). But thankfully Zoe is on the case!! Then Zoe's mom shows up with some great news or is it not really so great after all?
1,Horrible,"I bought this to connect to my university wireless network. It connects for 2 minutes and then suddenly disconnects. The signal, even when connected to the network is either ""low"" or ""extremely low"". This card sucks! It's a waste of money."
1,Good concept poor implementation,I purchased this item based on the idea of having a PC card that would not stick out like a sore thumb. I've been using a Linksys 54G card that works great but I always knock off the end cover when I slip it into my computer bag.After installing and using for a couple of weeks I decided to ditch this thing. The reception is worse than bad. The ability for it to keep a connection is also substandard. I/O should offer all of it's customers a refund or offer some kind of fix.Unfortunately I sent in the rebate form and now I'll have to wait 10-12 weeks for a check.If your familiar with 802.g or are new to wireless networks save yourself the aggrevation and purchase something else.
2,Solid card but lousy signal,"I had a Dell TrueMobile card in my Dell laptop, but my wife kept bending the big antenna sticking out, to the point of it almost breaking. I saw this card and thought ""what a great idea!"" and ordered it. My signal strength went from EXCELLENT to POOR. And get this, my router is about 6 feet away through a wood floor. If I move the laptop off my lap and out around my knees, I get a GOOD signal, but a laptop is made for, well, laps.Well made card but lousy implementation of design. I doubt you will be happy."
1,Works for 30 seconds - then dies,"If I restart the card (disable/enable), it will connect for about 30 seconds (if I'm very close to my router) - then the signal strength drops to nothing."
3,lindbergh,Im very unhappy. I never received the item.Gerd KnoteBiography - Charles and Anne Lindbergh: Alone Together
4,A well-crafted historical novel of Genghis Khan,"For Taylor Caldwell's legions of fans, this novel provides her usual wealth of historical detail and finely drawn characters. The book covers the early life of the great conqueror, focusing primarily on characters: his stern and indomitable mother, the cynical and outcast uncle who educates him, his manipulative wife Bortei, the boyhood friends who become his generals and paladins, and his blood brother Jamuga, who is both his dearest friend and bitterest enemy. Caldwell provides considerable rationale for the Genghis Khan's later spectacular career of conquest, which is not covered in the book. The novel draws a hugely colorful and very detailed portrait of life in Central Asia during the Middle Ages: from nomadic desert tribes, to wealthy and decadent cities like Samarkand, to the decaying empires of China. For lovers of colorful historical fiction, this book is quite a treat!"
5,Great Historical Fiction,"I randomly came accross this book when gaining some interest in history's true barbarians. I decided to give it a try and was pleased I did so. The book covers the earlier part of Genghis Khan's life, tracing many events and relationships that help the reader understand how Genghis Kahn came to rule and terrorize most of Asia. The book also provides interesting insight into the nomadic lifestyle during that time. Caldwell does a great job of mixing in spirituality into the story, which also contains plenty of action. I flew through this book......."
2,Not impressed...,"I purchased my scale at Target about 6 years ago. I'm packing it up to send back to the manufacturer for the third time.First time the batteries died after about two months.Second time the plastic cover cracked at the base after about 2 1/2 years.Third time the plastic cover cracked again at the base after about 3 years.The company honors the lifetime warranty.The good news is that for the cost of return shipping I get a new scale every two or three years.The bad news is that I have to pay shipping and return the scale every two or three years.When this return/replace cycle gets too tiring, I'm going to spend a little extra and get something a sturdier."
2,brand new but still inaccurate,"after resetting it, i weighed myself several times in a row and got different readings. returning it tomorrow. just pay extra and get one that's accurate!"
2,Dangerous but not inaccurate--so far,"I've had this scale for a week or so and haven't had any problems with accuracy, but it is very dangerous as it isn't skid-proof."
1,Cannot be used at high resolutions without an amplifier,"Before ordering this cable, take a read of [...] -- it explains maximum length/resolution/refresh rate limitations of DVI. In my specific case this cable did meet expectation because it did not support 60hz on a 55' television at 1920 x 1080. I experienced either a blank screen or very low quality output. To enable this scenario correctly, you'll need to purchases a DVI signal amplifier/repeater."
4,Hours of Fun,"My five year old daughter received this as a gift. While she had difficulty actually adding and totaling the ""purchases"", that didn't diminish her fun at all. She has definitely enjoyed this toy -- she has played with it a lot even after the ""new"" wore off. Even though she can't read, she can punch enough buttons to play with most of the features. The ""microphone"" and the pretend money were probably her most favorite features. I recommend this toy highly. I think it's worth the money."
4,sunniegrl67,"My daughter loves this toy, she finds it exciting and fun. She does need my help occasionally to scan the cards, but overall she loves it."
3,Second opinion that is too difficult for non-reading child,"My four year old got this last year. Although she loves the microphone - and all of her friends do too - they are all unable to properly work the register. It is difficult to run the cards through the card-reader and to figure out what they need to do next. I think it should be recommended for children 6 and up, 4 is much too young."
4,Barbie cash register,"I would reccomend for children over 6. It is pretty detailed for young children. My daughter has a hard time swiping the merchandise cards. Good for learning to count money, etc."
1,peice of crap,i had this when i was like 7 or 8 and the on of switch broke off. i had to stick a pencil in it and turn and wait till it turned on. if i were you i wouldnt even think of buying it
4,Cool toy!,"this is a cool toy especially for younger ones. I used to play with it, and i remember it was fun. And you could learn a lot actually! I think it helps in math. You could learn to count and add and subtract. Also it is fun because almost everyone loves shopping and this is almost like shopping in your very house! You could use any item in your home and turn it into an item for sale at your ""store,"" You can choose your own price, whether its on sale or not and more! I remember i used to have much fun with it especially when friends came over. In general, it is a great toy! But one thing i dont really like is that the cash register (barbie) does all the talking. IT says the price, and welcome, and all that stuff. So the ""clerk"" doesnt really do much but check out and give money back and stuff like that. But other than that its great!"
5,Perfect,"I can't believe how hard it is to find a SAFETY collar for a cat. I'm not sure why anyone makes collars that aren't. It's not safe. Cat's necks aren't as strong as a dog!Anyway, I wanted a collar that would breakaway if needed but was also sparkly and pretty. Plus, I needed a bell so they stop sneaking into areas where they aren't allowed! (Sneaky cats!!) The white one looks great on my white/grey cat and the black one looks awesome on my black cat. I tried alternating it so the black one was on the lighter cat, but I think it looks better to match the collar to the cat so the rhinestones show up."
1,Fell off within days,"This collar was cute, but it would not stay tightened around our cat's neck. It fell off within days, losing all of her tags with it."
2,Black history analogy?,LOL! I know nothing about this product but have the Black Panther Party and Malcolm X been resurrected and started writing computer programs now? Is this a coincidence? The package has the exact same cover design as the Spike Lee film!
2,Is this money-ripping pressure really necessary?,"$129 every year for something that has a 20-day upgrade policy? What a JOKE! QUITE obviously, Apple marketing and I do NOT earn our monies in the same company.On top of that rip-off, it obviously has bugs, as I have learned to expect from the company that somehow every year manages to churn out half-beaten butter for our Macintosh ego-bread. Well, don't know about you, I feel that one predator is quite enough in my household for at least two to three years.Good luck, and buye buye (not misspelled)."
5,A pleasure to cook with,"The first thing you notice about this pan is the weight. This is due to the thick bottom and solid sides. This construction allows for very even heat distribution and excellent results in cooking. With no ""hot spots"", there were no burns and clean up was easy. This is not the cheapest 8 qt. stock pot sold by Amazon, but it is one of the better ones and is a very good value. For boiling water, the cheap pots are fine, but for soups and sauces, invest in a good pot like this one."
2,didnt last theat long,"i bought it in july 2012 it went in good and worked but it dec and the bearingsare already going out wouldnt recomend . i dont know how the warrenty stuff works on amazon . would be better just to buy it at your local auto parts store , at least you knowwhat to do if it goes out ."
1,worst movie Ive ever seen,"Boy,, This movie really takes the cake,This Movie is the worst movie Ive ever seen in my life. 1st It didnt even show the veiwer there was an actuall affair,you didnt find out about that till a couple sceens after it supposibly happened.Then they showed more blood than what was nessesary.Its like they dont even bother to tell you that they had sex(or one time stand)when it happened,But what they did bother to do was show all the gross bloody stabbing and killing that this dissturded girl did.I didnt even bother watching the whole thing,I skipped straight to the ending,Then returned it to the video store.Im glad I rented it before Buying it.I cant imagine who in their right mind would actually rate this a 5 star movie,If you do Im sure they got plenty of them to buy on amazon or at other places."
3,Ehh... It's okay...,"It looks nice and the whole concept behind it is nice, with all the different options available online for what you can track with the Orb. Of course, the colors are also nice.However, I've had the Orb for about six months and paid for premium service to track my local weather... and according to the Orb... it's only rained once in the last 5 months (and coverage isn't an issue, being near a major city). And so you know, aside from the weather in about 4 cities, and the generic Stock Market tracker, you need to subscribe to the premium service to have access to he other options ($6.95/month or $19.99/quarter).It's sleek, stylish, and a great conversation piece, but if you want up-to-date, accurate info, this probably isn't the best way to go."
3,big and fun!,"First of all, this is a really large toy and it does take up alot of space. I had to wait for spring to take it outside and inflate it. The inflating would be easier if it came with it's own nib to be put on an air compressor. Because it is outside, it fills up with water and it requires cleaning before use. All that being said, my children love to play in it! I have a 30 month old and a 14 month old who cry when its time to get out. They jump, climb in and out, and have asked to sleep in there over night! For us, it is worth the extra work. One note of caution, if not completely filled, two children can cause it to tip over if they are both leaning on one side."
4,great basics,"This is touted as the Bible of stand-up. There are very good exercises in here as well as funny anecdotes and bits of comedians of the 80's and 90's. It is a bit of a trip down memory lane with the pictures and comedic bits of old but still very helpful. If you have any interest in trying stand-up, I recommend this book. Thinking you are funny and creating funny are two different things and Judy Carter's book helps you learn the difference."
3,Use Me by Elissa Schappell,"The book is very well written, with excellent, well observed descriptions of places, people and events. The first few stories were absorbing and they drew you into the book, but after a short time, the main character, Evie, became tiresome because of her complete self absorption. The death of a parent is always a traumatic event, but Evie's total disintegration in the face of her father's illness and death became less about him and all about her. She was self destructive, and took out her pain and fear on all around her- her husband, her children and herself.Evie expresses her feelings with clever remarks and wiseguy comments, which give the book a light and amusing tone. However, her self pity and inability to accept the inevitable is incompatible with the writing, so in the end, instead of sympathy and understanding, the reader is left feeling annoyed and dismayed."
1,Revolting,"........................... I just have to believe that the author meant this as bleak satire; so much of the character Evie's obsession with her father (who not only must deal with cancer but also with his daughter's Electra-complex), and later with her little son, upon whom she transfers the unnatural-leaning affection prior felt for Pops (though her daughter was all but neglected and mistreated by overdoses of 'elixer'), are just disgustingly incestuous and certainly obsessive. I'm sorry, there's just no point in reading this book, unless you want to be grossed out."
5,Great DVD!!,I'm really glad I purchased this DVD. Alan Moore said a lot of profound things. Definitely something you can watch again and again.
5,IT WAS A LEARNING EXPERIENCE,The book was like Billy Joe's music; honest and to the point. It was great reading about his relationships with Waylon and other country stars. The lyrics to all his songs was a wonderful bonus. I only wished there was more.
4,a treat,The sound quality is a treat. The choice of music pieces are delightful and a warm cheerful addition to my sound collection.
2,Performance let down,"Bought this machine from Amazon and it worked 3 times and then died. Used a powerful blender, Vita Mix, and was excited that it made perfect smoothies, however; very short lived! After making 3 smoothies in 3 days, the machine just died on me. Checked the fuse and it's alright but changed it anyway just to make sure. Still not working! Very frustrated. Tried a 200w transformer and thank God, the Vita Mix is sluggishly whirring but this tells me that my blender works and not the 3000w transformer. Googled PowerBright and their website is down. Where do you contact the manufacturer for a replacement. It's driving me bananas! Problem is it was bought 3 months from US and we are now in the Middle East.... and this thing is very heavy for shipping. Is it worth is to spend more to ship it that what the product is worth."
4,cool robot,"I am a 12 year old boy who has just got into transformers. The only thing that's wrong is that his big mixing barrel becomes the arm which makes it kind of hard to stand him up. It tips him over. I like his minicon because it can attach to his contols when he's a truck and I've seen it on the show. When you put his key in, it shoots a little missle yay! Enjoy"
1,Expired Food Items,I orderd this for a gift and I am so embarrassed. It was for my mother-in-law and the food items were way past their experation dates. Also the cookies were smashed and soggy. I am so disappointed and humiliated to have given a gift with such poor quality. I am surprised at Amazon for including them in their site.So far I have not heard back from the company on what they intend to do about this.
5,Excellent Kindergarten Resource,"As a Kindergarten teacher, I have found the Starting Out Right book to be one of the best resources that I have ever used in my classroom. The text is very easy to read and very user friendly. The activities are great for any teacher making the changes in education. I only wish that I had found this book years ago. I would recommend this book for any teacher who is teaching reading strategies. In fact, my district is purchasing this book for ALL kindergarten teachers for our personal resource library."
3,"Great, but too predictable","I really liked this book and thought it was well written, but it had an identical plot to Jenny. The guys in both books were keeping secrets. Plus, the girls in both books thought the guys (Kurt and Trevor) liked some other girl, when there turned out to be a reasonable explanation for the guys' realationship with the other girl. I really loved Jenny and thought Kathy was great too, but they're just too similar. It made reading Kathy not as exciting because I could predict Trevor's secret, since it was so much like Kurt's. You'll have to read both books for yourself to see the similarities. I definately recommend them."
4,Great deal,This is a great deal. It is a lot cheaper when compared to the prices at the local pet store. Just watch out for charcoal dust coming out the bottom of the box. It can make a mess.
3,Good Value,"I think these are a better value online than buying locally, however over the years the floss seems to have gotten thinner and their is very little carbon in them. I'm using them a pengiun biowheel 350 and for the price the filter performs well, however if I can talk my wife into a larger tank I think I might go to a canister filter."
1,Worst EMS book every written.,"J.A. Karam is obviously an amatuer writer who graphically overempahiszes every part of this book and every person. Anyone with a mediocre level of intelligence can picture a bunch of overweight underachievers eatting ""cheese whiz"" and ""eight White Castle burgers"" while contemplating the ""what if's"" in life. Don't waste your time on this book if you are considering entering the world of EMS. EMS professionals do not abuse new employee's nor do we plan on spending our lives on the streets. We move on to educating the new EMS professionals, management or other positions within the healthcare industry with a future."
4,An eye opener,"All of my life I thought my problems stemmed from comments people other than my family made. I never thought that my father's alcoholism would have such an impact on my personal life. This book is a good starters book. It gave my a basic idea of different personality traits that adult children of alcoholics tend to develop. I rated this item with 4 stars and not 5 because the author writes about ""a cure"" many times. I don't consider myself sick or to be in need of ""a cure."" I do need guidance and help on how to succeed despite of some of the personality traits that are hindering my recovery."
5,Informative Guidebook,I found this book a very informative and thought provoking read. It raises tough truths for adult children of alcoholics. Had to read this book in stages as the content was confronting for myself but I encourage all adult children of alcoholics who want to better themselves to read this book.
3,trip the light - maybe not so fantastic,Ordered the Tripp Lite APS 2012 to replace 11 year old Exide 2000 inv.charger which got fried with lightning strike.I was amazed that 2011 technology didn't have a better appearance (yes I saw it online but was still hopeful). Unit is also heavier than the Exide.The connections leave something to be desired. Accepts only #2 wire for DC input (Ok if close to battery(s); #10 for AC; really too small for long runs.And. the available adjustments for system control are limited.The first unit arrived & didn't work properly. Took several calls & explanations to get replacement; + out of pocket shipping back to OEM; but so far it's up and running.Time will tell.GRW
1,A bootleg at twice the price?,"This ""Greatest Hits"" compilation is currently being offered by two different distributors under separate titles, one ""44 Greatest Hits"" and the other ""Some Enchanted Evening"", but with one selling at almost half the price of the other and both albums exactly the same! All tracks appear to be bootleg versions not sourced from original recordings. The credibility of everyone is at stake with this apparent contradiction and Qualiton ( the higher priced distributor ) refuses comment! I wonder why?"
5,good quality,i bought this for my cubicle and it is a very high quality print for the price. shipping was fast and i am satisfied with my purchase.
3,"Pleasant, enjoyable reading","I have been a follower of Marita Golden's work. While this novel does not hold the reader on the edge as her previous works, it is enjoyable. I truly enjoyed how she held my attention surrounding the child's death. Many times the reader will believe they have figured out all of the details to only find their conclusion was false. However, it depends on what character is describing the events. I read this book in three days and enjoyed every moment; especially the conclusion. It was realistic. In fact, the tone of the entire novel is ""believable"" . One can readily identify the characters."
5,I like it.,The CD was just what I expected and I very much enjoy the music. I like to put the CD in my car and just blast it on my way home from work. I don't know why I needed to put 20 words when I could have just said it was great.
4,Stephen Calt is very annoying,"According to Stephan Calt, Charlie Patton could walk on water, invented sliced bread, and would have single handedly won WWII for the Americans if he had lived long enough....However, if you can get past Calt's tiring badmouthing of anyone who was not Patton, you are in for a fascinating read. The research done by Gayle Wardlow is excellent, making the reader feel as if they have been transported to 1920's-1930's era Mississippi. Interviews with Patton's contemporaries are very interesting, and accounts of other blues muscicians (including Memphis Minnie and Willie Brown to name but a few) complete questions about their lives that CD liner notes leave out.This ""bible"" of Charlie Patton's life would have received 5 stars, were it not for Calt's amateurish writing style."
3,Nice but very limited selection of repertoire,"Nice work by the all male US Army chorus on the excerpt from the Testament of Freedom. A superb men's chorus is the most welcome aspect of this disc. But much of the standard patriotic repertoire is missing from this collection. Indeed, the disc contains an odd and rather paltry collection of recordings that are also available on CDs which I have gotten directly from the Army and which are which are distributed by the Army without charge to the public. Where are the National Anthem; Eternal Father; and so many other patriotic standards which are featured on fine patriotic discs by the Robert Shaw Chorale, the Washington Men's Camerata and the Morman Tabernacle Chior?"
3,Photo Misleading,The product is fine but the photo is really misleading and the description is not clear! YOU get ONE bottle of their choosing .
4,Buck,"Good product, works well, good value. Picture shows 3 containers of media, this can be a little misleading, one container is all you get."
2,"This design works with other brands, but not here","The design for these kinds of food choppers is a good one based on our previous experience so we bought this to replace a long lost food chopper of a different brand. After using this my wife and I are very disappointed. The plunger sticks on almost every ""chop"" and has to be pulled free of the plastics. Speaking of, the plastics are thin and appear to be budget workmanship, which is not what we would expect from Kitchen Aid. Will be returning this for a better (and unfortunately more expensive) brand name, probably Pampered Chef."
2,Not the best quality,"It chops up the food, but the blades get stuck and won't turn. It is harder to chop up the foods than other choppers I have had."
1,Chopper A Bust,"Had a Pampered Chef chopper before that wore out. Wish I would have bought another one of those instead of this one. Does not chop evenly, probably because it doesn't rotate. Pampered Chef choppers are worth the difference in price."
3,KitchenAid Food Chopper,"I had a Pampered Chef food chopper for many years, but it finally broke. I thought I'd try the KitchenAid food chopper. It works okay, but not as well as the Pampered Chef one. The blades don't rotate without help, and it seems flimsier, not as sturdy."
2,Didn't Last,"After only 5 months of limited use we started finding bits of plastic in our food. Even brand new it had only lackluster performance. I tried to save a few bucks over the pampered chef model, but it was money wasted."
3,Just OK,"This product was purchased based on reading other reviews for this particular product as well as similar product reviews. I generally like KitchenAid brand products, and when you add the word Pro to the title, while you just expect something more. I found chopping onions rather cumbersome -- you have to slice them no more than 1/4"" and then halve or quarter them so they will fit inside the container. Not any faster than chopping by hand; by hand I would have been able to dice them finer. On the positive side, it comes apart easily and cleans up in the dishwasher, and I like the color (although it costs more). Overall it's just OK."
1,This book is the worst drivel I have ever read,"I tried - I really did, but I could not bear to finish reading this book. It was so awful. The dialogue was unbelievable. The characters were worse than cliche - no human beings exist like these in nature. Avoid this book at all costs."
1,Left scratches and swirl makes on my LCD monitor,"I have a beautiful 24"" 16x9 Dell monitor, and this left swirl marks and scratches across the surface of the screen. I can see them distinctly when the monitor is off, but not when I turn the monitor on. The cloth on the applicator creates a hard surface and the dirt accumulating on the cloth in combination with the hard surface leads to the scratching.You are better off with just a good microfiber cloth and some cleaning solution; e.g., Monster. Monster adversities it has no alcohol and this product contains just that. Maybe another reason for the scratches."
2,I thought it would work a little better,"This cleaning kit, consists of a brush to wipe off dust off small edges and between keyboard keys, and that one works well. The plastic at the bottom of the brush, is soft and has little or no edges so no scratches when brush is pushed all the way down.Cleaning liquid is supposedly applied to other end of brush, where it has a small cleaning cloth, this didn't work well at all, no matter how much liquid you put on it it just doesn't clean the screen well. My Screen now has a thin residue cover all over it, which almost seems like ""grease"". I think computer-wipees are a better option than this kit, and less expensive too."
3,"Good for the price, but not the best cleaner around","First of all, the fluid in the bottle is just rubbing alcohol so don't get tricked into buying more of it for an exorbitant price.The cleaner works well for my 22"" computer monitor, but on my 32"" LCD T.V. it leaves streaks and is much too small to use and a microfiber cloth does a much better job. Overall though I would say it is good for small screens, but be careful with the duster side of it, it has semi-sharp edges and could scratch your screen if you aren't careful."
2,disapointment,"I bought this for my daughter last christmas. I thought it was so cute. We spent half of the day she opened it putting it back together. We ended up super glueing all the pieces together. She plays with the dolls and the slide some, but it is not what the ads promise at all. I would recomend this only to children above the age of five."
2,Not Recommended,"I've found that this toy falls apart very easily, and is very unstable to use for little hands. My daughter cannot put Kelly in the swing and ""buckle"" the safety strap; it's difficult for even an adult to secure the strap. The slide is constantly coming apart from the swing-set base. Kelly's ability to play peek-a-boo is limited; her arm barely reaches her ear, let alone her eyes. We have yet to be able to coordinate the noises from Barbie while Kelly swings. My daughter is playing more with the dolls themselves than the swing set. I would not recommend this toy."
1,A little tough for my toddler,"I give you (Amazon) 5* for giving this the recommended age rating of 6months to 2 years. Though I agree with you that this is a completely infantile game, my 1 1/2 year old was a 'little' stumped."
2,Boooring,"This game stinks! I am a huge survivor fan, this game was so dissapointing, first of all you need a lot of poeple for this game to be fun, someplace like a party, except once you start playing the game goes on and on and gets really boring. Not even close to as good as the real Survivor"
3,good pump bad sizing,"well i order these pumps in pink which is a rally pretty color but i usuley wear 7 or some shoes 7 1/2 on this they only had size 7, 8.1/2,or 9 avalibel, so i order 7 but when i got it and put it on its really tight and pinches my foot the right foot for some reason more then the left one, but over all its really cute and sexy looking pump and i would buy it again but a size bigger.: :)"
3,Opteka Voyeur Review,Awkward to use. Takes time to get used to. Image quality is good and lens is light.
2,bad instructions,The only thing good about this shed is that it is no maintenance vinyl. The instructions are cumbersome and the framing material is soooooo cheap. I would never put this shed out in the open.
5,Black Diamond Owl Optical Wallet Light,"Ordered July 9 and received August 17 - seller claims it was shipped previously and UPS lost it but graciously reshipped - ok, as long as I got it I'm happy. Product is exactly as expected, in great condition, and shipped in sturdy box to protect it."
1,This item sucks,"This is the most ridiculous item I have ever seen, the only thing more ridiculous than this so called ""invention"" is the commercial that supports it. Seriously, have Americans lost their ability to create something good? What a crappy invention. Whoever created this has way to much time on their hands, first to create it, and second to come up with all these reasons why you would need it. Give me a break, and stop feeding me all this B.S. about all the use's. It is a magnifying glass with a light. They have been around for ages. Please I beg you stop selling crap like this on T.V. and wasting my viewing time. Invent something good. Have a beautifull day."
1,One out of three bags leaks,"Despite handling each bag carefully, flattening it so there are no sharp edges...approximately 1 out of 3 bags has a pinhole leak. Makes a mess in my fridge and forces me to waste an entire bag of milk. Buy Medela even if you don't have a Medela pump.Medela bags are reinforced with a more durable plastic that has not caused any problems for me thus far."
1,Leaked upon defrosting,"At first, I thought these bags were great. However, after making the time to pump everyday for months, I found that 75% of these bags leaked upon defrosting. The seams on the edge of the bags split (or had holes), and my precious breastmilk leaked all over the fridge over and over again. I do not have a recomendation for a better product, but if you are considering using these or if you are currently using these, I would consider something else . These are extremely dissapointing."
1,LEAKS!,I pumped for a couple months and put all the milk in the freezer. When thawing in the fridge the majority of the bags leaked horribly. Bad design with seams that come apart very easily. Many other reviewers have noted the same problem so it wasn't just a fluke.
5,Excellent product,The Lansinoh 20435 Breastmilk Storage Bags are easy to manage. No leaks. Great design for easy storage and the tabs with the dates are clearly visible once they are in the freezer.
2,Leak out 1/2 the time and inaccurate measurement,"These bags are ok, but do tend to leak out when you freeze them! Also, the measurement on the bag is deceiving. The bag showed 6 ounces, I really only had 4!! I would stay with the Medela plastic bottles for freezing milk. They last longer in the freezer!"
1,DO NOT BUY THESE BAGS!!!!,"Do not buy the Lasinoh bags! They are not freezer safe! I dont know about you, but I work hard to pump and get the breastmilk my baby needs. When it comes time to defrost in the refrigerator, 1/2 of the milk leaks out! So upsetting. I do NOT recommend these bags under any circumstance."
2,Unhelpful,"I bought this book because I wanted somebody to better explain some of the hard topics in C# instead of just re-typing what I already have in the MSDN files that came with my copy of Visual Studio DOT NET. I thought this book would clarify all my questions about Delegates and Events for example but it did not.After getting frustrated with the book, I turned to the Web to find help about Delegates and Events and I found some very good articles. This made me think I could have saved a few dollars and headaches by using the Internet. I found that they start talking about some important topic and then they say ""Well if you really want to know the complete story please buy another book that talks more about it..."" And they haven't even given you at least a basic working example!!!.I am sure this book has its pearls here and there but so far I haven't spotted any!!!"
4,Little late but good service,Book came little late but in good condition. I will buy again from this merchant.
3,Needed more menu selections,"I am 47 with iffy knees so I wanted a beginner stepper dvd. The stepping is fine but I thought Debra needed to give more warning when she changed steps. If you don't pay close attention, you'll miss her cue on what's coming next.Also, I wish the menu would let you select a workout based on time. Maybe break it up in 10 minute sections."
3,shilo,I am an advance stepper and this DVD is deffinately for beginners. So it is quite slow for me. If you are wanting to learn how to step then this one is for you. So I would rate it has a 4 for a beginning stepper. Have fun.
1,chinese checker(s) board,"MY DEFINITION OF PREMIUM, DIFFERS BY AN INFINITE AMOUNT. LAYERED TOILET PAPER IS THE CORE THAT WAS EXPOSED BY THE THREE DAMAGED CORNERS. COME ON, THERE'S ONLY FOUR. THE ONLY LIKEABLE FEATURE,BUT STILL BOGUS, IS THE RUBBER FEET INSTEAD OF FELT. CHINESE MADE. THEREFORE, CHINESE CHECKERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,******,"Great read. I read it twice and enjoyed it much. I learned a lot from this book. Not too elaborate on technicalities of screenwriting, but good all the same."
1,I got the album Lake Shore Drive instead,"I got this CD thinking i would add it to my listing for the fur babies when i travel. Imagine my surprise when i popped the CD into the computer to load into iTunes and it asked if i wanted to import the CD ""Lake Shore Drive"", a country folk album by Aliotta Haynes Jeremiah. I looked at the CD again , which was clearly labeled Songs to Make Dogs Happy, with all the right CD cover in the case but after imported to just make sure, Yep, it aint squeaky deaky. went to the site listed and sent them a note. IF their quality control is that hosed, I don't want anything else from them. I think i'll re-look other options, like the ""While you are Gone"" and Through a Dog's Ear"" series of CDs. it's more soothing to them and me.unbelievable...."
4,Woah?!?................,"Ok I got this game 2 christmases ago and must say Im so dissapointed!!!!!The idea is dumb,youuse battle cards and all you do is wait to be pulvarized by the impossible bosses and can like never use your special attack.The graphics suck and the battle idea is stupid.I have never wrote a bad DBZ review but this one.I wouldnt spend a dollar on it.Just get taiketsu instead thats much better.If you want a good Ps2 game get budokai2.Trust me I guarentee youll not like this game."
4,dbz game,"I recived this game about three or four days ago and so far it is pretty good. You start as Gohan right after Raddiz is killed and Goku is sent to the after life, you learn how to fight by Piccolo and then you fight him. From that point it follows the series. The only real faul in this game is that it is too true to the series and it is usually just a bunch of talking, fighting a bad guy, then you might get a chance to move around but that happens rarely. Also, the game gets a little hard when you go against Freiza. Even though you're Super Sayian, he still is very strong. I've lost to him about eight times."
1,"Roses are red, this littler box isn't blue!","This litter pan is exactly what I wanted for inside my cat's bigger box, and I would have given it 5 stars, except that it is not blue! The title and description say that it would be peacock blue --- too bad the product that arrived is beige. Not a big deal you may think --- after all it's only a litter pan.I wanted a small blue litter pan to go inside the navy-colored big litter box that is located in my blue bathroom. If I was willing to settle for just any color litter pan I could have gone to the local discount store and bought one there.Perhaps aesthetics are not important to you, but I just wanted to tell other potential customers that what you see is not necessarily what you get."
3,Great movie if you're not particular about historical accuracy.,"I've been a Nathan Hale fan for most of my life. I had to just let that go and enjoy the movie for itself. The acting was good, but the girl's makeup made her look really creepy. And my husband laughed when Hale appeared at the inn in a huge cape. No, no, I'm not a spy. Not at all.The early color effects were really amazing, though."
5,great,"excellent product for cleansing and balancing the sodium in the body, good for the Gerson Therapy and really seemed to help achieve positive change in the body"
3,Close shave but not the best for moustaches.,"Gives me a noticeably closer shave than my old triple head units, but does not shave effectively next to my moustache. The triple head shaver was able to get closer in without cutting the moustache hairs I was hoping to keep. The sideburn trimmer is not as easy to use as it should be, but cuts well if you get the angle right. The cleaning system make a racket but the fluid has lasted well, perhaps because I only use it once a week. I've never come close to running down the battery even with the weekly chargings."
3,"Good, but not great","I like the shaver, but my biggest gripe is the trimmer.. It does not come as close as other razors I have had.. It is HORRIBLE on my side burns.. The razor it self is great and I love the cleaning is great also.. I can really tell the difference between a shave with the razor after a few shaves without cleaning it.. I really like the LCD, it tells me how long it needs to charge for and how long cleaning is going to take.. If only the trimmer were better I would have given this a higher rating for the trimmer plays a large role in the razor score.."
2,Too much additional $$$,Overall the unit shaves good but that's about it. The foil & heads don't last as long as indicated so need to be changeed often. The cleaning solution is also a constant purchase. Also after a while the cleaning portion stopped functioning !! I initially bought it to save money on constantly chaning razor heads but in the end quality razors are cheaper to replace than maintaining this unit.
1,Refund Please,"Are these guys serious? It's almost like an entire album of sea shantys. I can't get that stupid Popeye theme out of my head. If you want to buy this album, go to a used CD store, I'm sure you'll find plenty. Then you too can experience the thrill of wasting money."
5,I like this. It looks good.,"I really like it. It is also funny when it talks and looks like a good toy for all ages. Again, I really like it."
1,saddam biography by an israeli,"this book is very biased,not hard to understand seeing this book was co written by an israeli.israel and iraq has been arch enemies for a long time,how can a person who was taught to dislike and hate hussein write a non biased book on the man.i'm waiting for a biography of saddam hussein written by an iraqi author who can tell us what it really was like knowing saddam hussein and living under saddam hussein years in power in iraq."
3,nice but ..,"1. Love the small form factor.2. The Motion Eye is a nice concept but the image quality is not that great, it is also slow to refresh the image. You can only turn the cam up and down - very limiting3. The case is plastic ... and for the kind of money I put into this gadget, I kind of wish it feels alot more solid ...4. CDROM sound is pretty loud whenever you put a CD in.5. Sound quality (SUCKS BIG TIME) with the tiny speaker ... yuk!6. Screen is bright and crisp7. The fonts are WAY WAY too small for a 30+ years old man. For long period of use, I find my shoulder and eyes screaming for help ..."
4,"motion eye,camera, problem","all the reveiws i read were from the 2003,2004,airer and did not refer to the problem of the magic eye going poof even if not used as they are always on when computer is on,they draw their power from the usb circuit the only thing you can turn off is the program.sony is aware of this problem and stick their head in the sand when it comes to admitting it.their are more tr series out there with bad cameras.i had mine replaced under warrantee used it once when i got it back,worked great.three months i tried it again and poof again.you can buy 5 or 6 web cams for the price sony wants for replacement.i gave this a 4 star rating as i don't use the camera .also the keybord leaves a bit to be desired.also the speakers are a little high pitched. all in all a great little computer."
1,Unreadable Text. It's WAYYYY TOOO SMALL TO READ,"The text is so small a normal human being can't read it. I was so excited to get this book and the text was so small. I tried to read it but was getting headaches and serious eyestrain. Why are these publishers so cheap? Why not have legible text? Why do they print these classics too small to read? No wonder kids hate reading these classics. I search high and low for text that big enough to read comfortably. I'm a young guy and there is nothing more frustrating than small mouse sized text.I'd pay a dollar or two more for legible text... but it's way too small to read... and the whole point of a book is to ""READ"" it. It's like making a car with no windows... or a tiny little one inch windshield. It's silly... BIGGER PRINT, BIGGER PRINT, BIGGER PRINT (CHANT) ON CLASSIC BOOKS!!!!"
5,sherlock holmes volume 2,"awesome book, even though i like the first volume better . i like this book a lot. the insights into the life and skills of the great sherlock holmes and his methods of decduction and catching the criminal no matter what."
1,just another black history book.,"this book like all black american history books that took place around or during the civil war try to make all other races seem inferior by trying to say its all the fault of the anglo or hispanic americans.that was a long time ago and i personally think that blacks have evolved into what they have because of other great men like martin luther king , so to me it almost wasnt worth the effort to blow the dust off the cover so i could get to its totally boring contents."
4,Not what I expected,"I haven't finished this book yet, but it' s one of those books I think about because I can't wait see what happens."
5,In self-knowledge there is liberation.,"The title of this book might imply a certain hopelessness or a sense of being trapped by Fate. Nothing could be further from the truth. What this book reinforced for me is the knowledge that when we begin to comprehend the necessity behind our existence, there is liberation. When we get down to the bedrock of who we are, we see that our true individuality makes us participants in the journey of our life, not helpless creatures stuck in a vast spider web of someone else's making. The Astrology of Fate reminds me of James Hillman's book, The Soul's Code, which also showed me that in accepting and understanding who I truly am, I can be more than the facts of my life--or the configuration of my stars."
2,"Beautiful, but SO much work","I would agree with the other reviewer that this 8 gallon tank is not for goldfish. I was a complete novice and received the tank as a gift, with little or no instruction. I mistakenly overloaded the environment with, originally 9 small goldfish, but now have 5 left. I must frequently clean the tank, on average once every two weeks, and at this point, I get algae blooms on a regular basis. The goldfish definitely overload the weak filtration system constantly, and there is no way of avoiding this mess. Only buy this product if you wish to have one or at most two very small fish. On a last note, if it wasn't so much upkeep, the product itself makes for a lovely small tank."
1,Disgusted,"This fish tank killed my fish. You can only use the specialty rocks that come with the tank, and my fish got trapped under them. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
1,Leaky,"I have had it for less than a year and it's now leaking out the bottom. I screwed it in a little tighter, and it's now leaking faster? There is also water in the line. I contacted the manufacturer so we'll see if they're helpful. Sort of a bummer because it does look nice. Although it's expensive to maintain.."
4,Surprisingly realistic fantasy,"Picked this up on a whim--I think it won a children's book award--and read it in a day. Nice little contemporary (20th Century) fantasy about a Jewish girl in Hungary before, during, and after WWII. ""Fantasy"" may be the wrong word, for while there are some fantastic things going on, the happenings are startingly realistic. In some worlds, this one might be considered magic realism, except that the characters are surprised and awed by the fantastic. They seem to accept it as natural, however. The really surprising thing about this book, though, is the changes of the lead character and the time scale. I didn't expect the character to ""grow up""; I didn't expect a lot of what happened. A non-predictable fantasy? Yes. How rare."
4,Bauer's Greek-English Lexicon,"Excellent resource for any Greek scholar. The only reason it deserves a four-star is because new editions have since been released. I'd recommend an up-to-date edition; however, the earlier edition has not hindered my academics."
2,DONT WASTE YOUR TIME-READ ENGEL'S MEMORY BOOK,"this book was such a disappointment, I almost didn't readMemory Book which is yes, set in the same hospital but as Howard says, from a different set of eyes.This confused experiment with Wright is flawed. An interesting try and a dismal failure. To then go on and write Memory Book, well Oliver Sacks should know when an achievement is outstanding.Life is short - skip this - read Memory Book which deserves every award possible. Go Benny, go!jb"
1,What an sorry story,"What an sorry story! the last part was part OK, An complete lost of money! Dawson,I Love Halo 1 and 2 but not this"
5,Gotta Love The Guys At Rooster Teeth,"The Blood Gulch Chronicles is one of the funniest shows I've seen in a long time. Very good story line, Perfect characters, great use of Halo 1 and 2's multiplayer actions. I recommend for all Halo series fans."
3,It was okay,It wasn't like new the box was quite tattered. But the DVD's were in good shape. And the person was quite happy with the gift so I am satisfied.
3,don't get rid of your single disc edition of Lifeforce,"Just picked up this triple feature because I wanted Burnt Offerings, and for the price, I figured I might as well get more bang for my buck. I already had Lifeforce in a single disc edition, so my thought was that I could get rid of it after getting this. For starters, Lifeforce is in need of an anamorphic transfer (maybe the blu ray will get released?), but here, you get the same letterboxed print as on the single disc. HOWEVER, the big difference is, on the single disc version of Lifeforce, the audio is in 5.1 surround--on this triple feature, it's only 2.0 stereo!!! Bummer."
2,At least the blue lights look good...,"I bought these expecting at least some bass in them, but it's as if the bass on an amplifier was turned all the way down and then some. The only differences between these and laptop speakers are the quality of the sound and the cool-looking blue lights on the sides of it. It's pretty portable also and connects to the USB port on the laptop for both the electricity and the sound.Pros:very portableconvenient to storeclearer sound than laptop speakerscool-looking blue lights on the side of itCons:no bassnot very loudConclusion: If you're looking for convenience, portability and a clear sound, these are good. If your looking for speakers that aren't as portable, but at least has SOME bass, then I recommend stereo speakers that cost about the same price as these ($30.00)."
1,Forever Yours Wedding/Anniversary Gift Basket,"For the price I expected much better. It was packaged well, but the contents were definitely not worth the price. The bow was limp and lifeless and I was almost embarassed to add my gift among the other beautiful gifts there. When I called to give my opinion to the Forever Yours company, they did reimburse my credit card for 20% of the cost. It was too late to return it as the event took place in just a few days and I would have had to pay an additional cost of shipping so I chose the reimbursement instead."
1,Poor Quality-Don't Buy,"Within 30 days of buying, the paint is coming off of the inside. This means the paint comes off on my daughter's hair. Unsafe! Don't waste your time on this unit, very POOR quality."
3,it's ok for the price,"No its outstanding but it gets the job done. I had a chi and had a problems with the lack of heat settings, This one has 20 heat settings but its highest is not as hot as the chi which I like but other people might not. The black coating started to chip after about 3 month and once that happens it begins to snag on your hair. I'm about to retire it and get another one with no coating so that I don't have to worry about chipped coating. But I will miss the fact that it's soooo pretty."
5,A great book,I love the story! Of Jesus from birth to dying on the cross to His resurrection! I also love the extras at the end of the book. It provides a recipe and two other decorating ideas.
2,Misleading Size,"I bought these grills to replace some old ones on my boat. I had one existing grill from the original speakers so I used that as a basis for size. When ordering these I was careful to measure twice with the measurements given on the website, comparing that to the existing grill. When I received them and went to install them they were too large to the speakers. Be careful of the size if this is for a replacement grill."
4,Artful Cards,Just purchased this book today and am amazed at how many great project ideas are in this book. Photographs of the projects are lovely and directions are pretty simple. I'm looking forward to sharing it with my rubber stamping friends!
4,My Wonderful Indoor Grill!,"I bought this pan about 3 years ago. It hangs on a side of my cabinets where I can reach it easily. Today, it looks as new as the day I bought it. Cleans up so easily! Just a little soapy water and a soft dishrag or plastic pad... and it's looking new again! I cook on a gas stove and the handle of this pan does require me to use a potholder of some sort. It's not exactly hot... more, just uncomfortably warm. Since the description says handle stays cool... I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. All in all, this pan is a workhorse, it doesn't hold odors and it's one of the best kitchen pans I've ever purchased. I love the ability to grill indoors on my stove without having to give it any thought! I can easily grill four steaks on this pan. Or 2 large steaks. Think I'll have a nice grilled steak tonight!"
4,The Black Bear,"This little Black Bear is really cute! I had not seen of this Webkinz until I found it on Amazon.com. My daughter had asked for this for her birthday. She was very glad to receive it. Its nicely designed. Was so thankful that Amazon.com had exactly the items I was looking for. My first experience with Amazon.com was very pleasant, and I will utilize Amazon.com again in the future."
2,Didn't like it,Had problems with cd player after just a couple of months. The cd's would work in my other cd player.
2,tape never worked for recording,i DID RESEARCH A Many things to try and find a decent recorder for daughter who likes to record singing I was no happy with it I knew the price was little but it was in a way a waste of time and a few dollars. I think it may have been fine just to have in an office or something thats why i gave a 2
2,Emerson PD6548BL AM-FM CD Cassette Player,CD player became inoperable after one month. I was past the deadline to return the unit. My loss. Everything else works fine. But I am clearly unhappy.
4,Perfect for our needs,"We bought a similar product at Target for our son (birthday gift) and were so disappointed we ordered this one the same day he opened it. Very happy we switched, it's perfect for his needs. No need for anything fancy at this point. Surprised there are still models out there with a tape deck!"
4,success,I bought this boombox for my son who was very happy with it. It looks beautiful and plays as well as expected.My only regret was not being able to receive free delivery.
3,Good,I expected it to be brand new but it did have a dent on it. So it wasn't exactly as described in the ad but it's a great radio!
4,webkinz cat,"Fast service, good fair price. Mt daughter loves her webkinz cat, Amazon is the best place to buy webkinz for variety and quick service!!!"
1,You will need a magnifying glass too,"This is a very small clock not much bigger than a wrist watch! The width of the clock face is only 1.5 inches so buy yourself some magnifying glasses too. I stuck it to the bathroom mirror and it stopped within minutes, its just too small and once it is stuck you can't move it to put it somewhere else if you don't like where it is. Also it is difficult to adjust the time or do anything with it (to see why it has stopped working) because it is stuck to the mirror. Probably my worst internet shopping purchase ever."
2,An Entertaing Book,"About two years ago I started doing research about moving to Costa Rica. I began by reading every tourist guidebook on the subject. Next I read three books about living in Costa Rica and made two preliminary trips to Costa Rica. I've been residing in the country for over a year and really was helped by all of the guidebooks I read about living here including ""Living Overseas"". However after much trial and error I have reached the conclusion that one person can't live on a budget of $1,000 monthly and have any kind of a decent lifestyle. It is impossible for a couple to live on said amount as the author claims on the back cover of this book. With their rent they would have to survive on $100 per week. I'm a single retired person and have to spend at least $1500 monthly to get by."
5,"Helprin is brilliant, sensitive and hysterically funny.","I have read nearly everything Helprin has written. All his books are absolutely stunning; but Antproof may top them all ... Helprin has begun to find a way to portray his women characters with almost as much depth and wit as his male heros. More books by Helprin ... please, oh please."
3,Dissapointing compared to his other novels,"I loved Soldier of the Great War and Winter's Tale, so I was dissapointed when Helprin covered the same ground, only not as well. The main character was not nearly as interesting as his other creations, and the plot structure seems to follow a formula that was better utilized in his other novels. Very little of the creativity that characterized them showed through here; it was replaced by laborious ramblings and unnaturally strained eccentricities."
4,great study guide for an apprentice electrician,This study guide was an excellent tool to me passing my electricians exam! I would recommend it to anyone going for there journeymans license the only down side to this guide if you don't understand certain calculations or formulas it doesn't elaborate a lot on math Or how to find the answers to calculations so you may need a formulas sheet so you may need some previous knowledge in the calculations to use this book to 100 percent. All and all this was a great study guide paid for itself passed the exam 1st attempt .
4,Dewalts cordless drill,"This is an excellent drill for contractors because of it power, the design of the handle to apply more presssure (Nessasary for concrete drilling or driving screws into hard items.)The runtime and torque are excellent. My only complaints are the cheap plastic feel of the drill casing. The casing is too weak to handle its torque. The tabs on the batteries wear out too easily.Dewalt is aware of this problem but I believe they wont change the battery mounts due to the compatablity issue with older cordless units."
3,Another good member of the series,Lots of fun - showing its age now of course. Played a lot of hours on this baby a few years ago.
1,Poor Quality,Quality is very poor. You can't see that from the on line images. But the towels start coming apart on their first use.
4,Liked,"They look and feel nice. Durable as well, I've had them for about 2-3 years and the big ones are still in good shape. The smaller ones are a little less inviting because the design on them takes away from the plush feel on the washcloth. I kind of don't like using them. But the 4 bigger sized ones are great :)."
2,"Smart design, epic fail","When i first purchased his product, i was a new turtle owner of 4 red eared sliders. I bought the dock at Petsmart, thinking it was a good idea as a basking area for my turtles. Unfortunately, once I installed the thing onto my tank, I noticed how slim the chances were of the turtles actually getting on to the device. Their little claws don't give them much purchase and they are unable to climb onto the dock. It has a small angled descent that is supposed to help the turtles climb on but it was not enough for my turtles to make it. Yea, the price is somewhat decent but its a lot more cheaper and more wiser to just grab some rocks from the backyard and make a dock oneself. At least that is a guaranteed way of knowing your turtles will be able to climb it."
1,Please don't waste your money....,"Wow, this was awful! The best thing about this DVD is that it doesn't last long. My boyfriend and I sat down to watch this together (in the mood to begin with) and both of us were completely turned off by it. The woman is not even naked, and wears a nightie throughout the DVD. She also is extremely hairy (a matter of personal taste I know, but this was very extreme). The tone of it was decidedly unsexy, more of a strictly how-to than a way to excite the watcher(s). It seemed to me to be very low-budget and unimaginative. Spend your money on something else if you're looking for sexual excitement..."
1,Waste of money,"I bought this video based on the reviews it had. I must say, this was the worst video I've seen in a long time. Boring, boring, boring. The most interesting part was the first 5 minutes, but the problem was the next 25 minutes was the same as the first 5. The DVD jacket said ""detailed, explicit demonstrations, and descriptions of female orgasm"". I didn't see any of this. What a waste of money."
4,"So Ridiculous, It's GOOD!","You eat people, you destroy things (like in Rampage) and have a fair amount of sandbox freewill (like in GTA). Oh yeah, and the first boss is Shamu from Sea World (seriously!) It's so freakin' crazy weird, that I can't help but to highly recommended it!!!!"
1,A WASTE OF INK,"As a medical doctor, I can tell you this book is filled with erroneous information. I refer to chiropractors on a daily basis. This book is grossly outdated."
1,A PUERILE ATTEMPT AT EXPLAINING ADOLESCENTS,"This must be one of the worst books I have read since Nancy Drew mysteries. The book is meandering and meaningless. The reader has no sympathy for a spoilt, arrogant little twerp. Holden spends his high scool years being thrown out of every institution he enters. He hates everybody from teachers to his parents, schoolfriends and girls.He is capable of erratic behaviour, drinking binges and spends money as if it was water. He comes from a wealthy privileged background but hates that fact. He is at war with a world which he thinks has betrayed him - everybody is a ""phony"" (a word which the author uses so often that it loses its meaning). Holden is absorbed in self-pity. The reader is compelled to take an unsympathetic stance to the whining main character (also the narrator). Net result-a big ""thumbs down"" for this one!"
2,"Not bad for the price, but kinda fragile","This tripod worked great, but it only took a month of barely even being used to wear down. In fact, I think I've only used it about 5 times, and now the strings have been completely smoothed out so now the head of it cant move without falling off, rendering it pointless to use. This is all due to the fact that the top of it is plastic, and the supporter part is metal. This is why it wore out so fast. Try and find a better material tripod if you plan to use it and keep using it."
4,Bravo Vivitar!,"Tripods should be reliable, inexpensive (c'mon, it's a tripod) sturdy, and easy to set up... this 'pod offers it all. An attractive little number, it is very lightweight, only 30 or so dollars, a snap to set up, and very sturdy...especially in this ""snap and go"" world... a good cheap buy!"
1,can't believe it doesn't use Hebrew script,"When i learn a language, i want to learn to write it at the same time i learn to speak it. It makes little sense to just learn to talk and not to read or write. One re-enforces the other. This book is completely based on phonetic spelling of Hebrew. Absolutely useless."
2,shockingly full of ghastly errors,"It's a good thing she doesn't use Hebrew writing. On the inside cover, she does for the shehecheyanu prayer, and makes six writing errors in it. She mispronounces often, and makes errors in meaning and word form (mistaking verbs for nouns, etc.). I've spent only a few minutes looking at the book, but found stunningly many and ghastly errors, in addition to very poor translations. Can you imagine, if you know Hebrew, accenting the word ""koach"" (strength) at the end, instead of the ""ko"" part. I could add a long list of such items, in spite of the fact that I've only looked at it for a few minutes.It's not only ""for"" dummies, possibly, but also ""of"" and ""by"". I am giving it two stars based on the impression that it could be useful to some folks such as tourists. But don't trust it."
1,You don't learn the letters,"The book is 100% in English, hence there are no hebrew characters. You don't learn the letters because you can't. Some sounds don't translate well and the English characters make it hard to remember what sounds the word is. There are a lot more resources out there that teach you the letters and still really a lot on English"
2,100' Steel Tape,"I'm a real estate appraiser and used this tape gently for about 3 months before the end snapped off this morning. A major dissappointmnet since my previous tape lasted nearly 3 years. It did wind quickly which was nice, but should have lasted longer than 3 months."
1,Doesn't Work,"From the day I got this product, I could never use it. Just keeping the battery in and the battery door on was a challenge. It kept popping out of place, but if I pressed in the very top of the battery cover the lights would come on. When I finally found a way to hold the battery down, the belt did NOTHING. I'd turn it on and stare at it, waiting for it to do SOMETHING, but it never did. Then the lights would all go off and I'd have to turn it back on again.I can't say that it doesn't work at all, since the lights came on, but it didn't do anything when it finally did turn on. A waste of money, but if I'd gotten one that worked right, maybe I would be happier?"
2,Its an OK product.,Its an OK product to start with. Though the plastic used is cheap but it works. And the price is also cheap except that I had to pay almost equalant for the shipping. I would have been happier if this product have been shipped free.
1,one start is too much,"what a SCAMM!! this crapp is the worst thing i bought in years!! amazon please take this down!i try to used once and i got rash!!! it looks like a joke,"
2,not nearly sensitive enough...,"I got this mic, because I do a lot of work conference calls via Skype, and I got tired of using an uncomfortable headset. Unfortunately, even when talking loudly from about a foot away from this mic (and the Windows microphone volume turned up to its max), the other people on the call can barely hear me. They say I sound like I am very far away. I'm not at all impressed."
5,Nice Microphone,"I got this microphone today and I used it with Skype and MSN. My friends told me that the sound was very clear as if I sat next to them. It's good that it's not USB microphone because I don't have many USB ports. Moreover, it's very easy to use. Just plug it in the mic port (pink one) and set the driver for microphone and use it."
3,A mixed bag...,"These stories were really hit or miss for me. I found some of the stories hard to get through, and others I absolutely loved (The Best of Betty, Under the Bed, Mr. Lazenbee). The humor is clever and at times quite grim. I enjoyed about half of the stories so much that I may return to the book at some point and give the other half a second shot."
5,This book gnaws at your brain,"I was blown away at these short stories. They are almost indescribable, I couldn't help feeling thru reading several of the stories that I was literally reading someone losing thier mind. I'm not saying the stories are garbled or unclear, very far from it. The author brings a mental picture into sharp focus and does it in a subtle way. Another reccomendation is these books by Banana Yoshimoto...""Lizard"" or ""Kitchen"" . In ways her writings remind me of Jincy Willet though on a diffrent scale.Check them out!"
3,14.4V DeWalt batteries are nothing to brag about,"I bought the 1/2 inch DeWalt hammer drill because it uses the same 14.4V batteries as my older 3/8 inch drill. Since the batteries had gone dead on the smaller drill, and replacement batteries alone cost about the same as the 1/2 inch hammer drill kit with 2 batteries, I decided not to change platforms. The batteries do not hold a charge for more than 20 minutes after a year of moderate use. Otherwise, the drill itself functions well. It is probably no better nor worse of a bargain than cordless drills from other manufacturers, since I think they all are struggling with battery technology. I do not know if the 14.4V battery platform is better or worse than others. I suspect that they all have their failings."
2,my phone,|I love my new phone. The price was the lowest I found for this phone. The service was great and the delivery was very fast. It was great doing business with Amazon. Thanks
1,Doesn't even hold a turtle,"I bought this product from my local pet store and returned it the very same day. The suction cup side is the only side that's supported by anything, so when the turtle climbs up onto it the whole other side sinks in and your turtle falls off. Don't waste your time or money with this product."
2,Gets turtle out of the water... but then he ate it!,"I bought this about a year ago so my stinkpot turtle could get out to dry his shell. Like others have said, it is not that aesthetically pleasing, but it did the job. After a few months, the lower suction cups stopped sucking to the glass, and it grew algae very easily. Even after scrubbing, the algae came back soon. Then my turtle chomped it up- gross! I hope he doesn't get sick! This time I will pay more to get a higher quality product."
2,"A prize winner, really?","Really hard to understand how this book won the coveted Edgar award. It got off to a reasonably promising start, but by the end I found myself skipping whole paragraphs -- they were just that dull, serving only to fill pages but doing nothing to advance the plot. This in a suspense novel. And the ending was just silly. Overall a big disappoinment."
5,Best Novel I Have Read This Year,"This is the most compelling novel I have read this year. The author's efforts fully justify the front cover endorsement by writer Vince Flynn.The Faithful Spy is gripping, suspenseful and ingeniously plotted. The characters are all well developed. The perspective provided by John Wells (the faithful spy) is both enlightening and uniquely refreshing.I encourage all readers of ""espionage-thriller"" novels to enjoy Mr. Berenson's inaugural novel. Hopefully there will be more to follow."
5,Great Page Turner,I now have read all 3 in the John Wells series and they just keep getting better. Looking forward to the next one.
1,Dissapointed...,I bought this player last week and im really dissapointed. It's skipping all the time and during 5 days i haven't heard any whole song. when it's starting to skip you need to stop for a while otherwise you won't be able to hear anything. and forget about running...
1,I got a failed unit,"Unfortunately, I have to say, I'm a Philips product owner.My dad bought me a Philips Expanium 201 mp3-cd ....For my deception, when I started to use it, strictly following the users manual instructions, I began to experience problems when using the unit.The sound quality is poor, sometimes the unit doesn't read new CD's in perfect conditions, sometimes when i skip two or more tracks, the unit start locks up and then turns off, and what's worst, often the unit starts to play audio at high speed, like getting crazy.I'm really disapointed, because i thought that Philips only make good quality products, but this unit doesn't work for nothing.... i think it was really money for nothing."
1,Dead monitor after 6 month,"I bought this monitor in December, 2004. Initially it works fine. But I noticed that the power can not be turned on sometimes. I tried several times, and it worked. Then about one month later, the monitor would never work again. There is no contact information on the product box neither on manual, I contacted the amazon and got a support phone number.TRG (aka Corian)Telephone: 1-703-533-8555However, when I called this number, the company is not the manufacturer and the lady who answered the phone said she got a lot of phone calls on the same issue that happened to me.Amazone did not even have a correct manufacture contact info!"
3,Nice monitor; probably no support,"I received the LCD monitor yesterday. Set it to 1280x1024 and watched a Divx movie. Pretty good picture. No dead pixel.The only thing makes me worry is the warranty. he box, user manual and warranty card are so generic. There is no company name/logo/address printed anywhere. From the Chinese version of user manual, I noticed the monitor is made by Chi Mei in Taiwan. Chi-Mei is one of the largest LCD monitor OEM in Taiwan. I think the quality should be ok. But if the monitor breaks someday, I really don't know where to send it for repair."
4,Very accurate microphone,"Though there is no calibration file to go with the microphone, but I ran calibration test to verify the sensitivity for the MM1 at 1KHz using 94dB and got very accurate values.Manufactuer : 15 mV/PaMeasured using ARTA: 15.0065 mV/Pa"
3,the smell too strong for me,"everything is good except the smell too strong when I spry on my hair, but it can reactive my curly hair after one night sleeping."
5,Best book I ever read - Where is volume No. 2 ?,"I bought this book 10 years ago and I have read it ever and ever again. It has only one disadvantage: where is volume No 2 ?It covers JFK's youth only....Hamilton promised to write a second volume, which would cover Kennedys years as a sentor and president too, about 10 years ago. I have been waiting for volume 2 for 10 years. I am mad at the author, that he keeps me waiting.What has happened to Hamilton ? Is he dead ?The first volume was a bestseller. Has he retired with the millions he made from volume one ?"
4,Good Product - one complaint,"I purchased this as an economical alternative to a power case trimmer. It works great. My only complaint is there is no method to control how deep the gauge screws into the cutter. If it is too loose and you screw it in tighter, the cutter begins to cut the gauge piece. I actually took mine apart, set the correct depth and super glued the gauge to the cutter. This was done after filing/sanding the gauge surface to repair the damage done by the cutter."
3,"Works well, but...","The cutting tool is hard to hang on to when cutting large caliber brass. Lee sells a separate cutting tool with a wooden handle that's easy to grip, but the lock stud doesn't come with it - kind of annoying that you have to buy both."
2,Clunky and Mannered,"First of all, Robert Olen Butler is an excellent writer, so when he undertakes a project you know there has to be some real potential in it.Unfortunately, ""Tabloid Dreams"" seems to be the exception. The gimmick here is that he has fashioned a dozen stories to explain a dozen tabloid headlines (real or made up? It doesn't really matter.) The problem is, with such outrageous premises, the stories do little more than expand on an already-ridiculous idea, and the reader is never fully ""vested"" in the story. There are some clever turns, and here-and-there he approaches the tenderness and compassion of his earlier short stories, but on the whole this collection falls flat with a resounding thud.Now that one of the stories (""Help Me Find My Spaceman Lover"") has been expanded into Butler's next novel (""Mr. Spaceman"") I'm revisiting ""Tabloid Dreams,"" but I'm afraid my opinion of it hasn't mellowed any since I first read it 4 years ago."
1,There when it's needed ..... NOT!!,What Can I say ..... Loud.... and the first time it was really needed ... It Failed. Piece of $%$ Now I have a Brand New house with a basement that has a 1/4 inch of Water
2,Archangels & Ascended Masters,Some of the text in this book seems like it's not so true. I've read a lot of books and I've experienced a lot of unexplainable experiences but some of these are just way over the top.
3,More information,I appreciate the intro by Doreen. I wish she would writea part 2 which described the active or opening abilities ofthe angels and masters of her book. Thank you.Jessye
4,Who knew???,"I need to research Doreen Virtue to find out how she knows so much! Once again, she presents information in a easy to read fashion. This book is a great resource. I had to purchase another one because my sister wouldn't give mine back!"
5,I'm really learning a lot!,"I already have Doreen's Angels and Ascended Masters card deck. The history, background information and invocations are adding great depth to my knowledge and awareness."
2,I expected better!,"She has a great voice and all but i just keep skip those tracks that didn't make sense. The only ones that got my attention was ""oops..."", ""dont let me..."" and ""Lucky"". The entire cd should have brought more energy, more up beat...something like *N Sync's! But then again i dont want her ever to put a cd just like *N Sync's No String Attached, because i dont want her to have the #1 spot on the Billboards. Only *N Sync should have the #1 spot! HE HE HE! No offense, Broccoli!"
2,Awkward,"The case itself looks and feels nice, especially for the price. Nice if you are left handed but I find myself always wanting to unclasp the leather strap with my right hand and when you do this it opens upside down. It's just kind of annoying. Perhaps that's why this one is so [inexpensive], I don't know."
2,Dan,"After you put your credit and some other cards and your checkbook you'll have problem to close this case - it's so bulky. You can't put this case inthe pocket - it so big. More of this, when finally I closed it - it turned on my Visor (all night it was turned on!!!) and I saw battery low warning on the next morning, when I opened it!!!"
1,disappointing,"The book's full title is ""Overturning Conventions and Shaking Up the Marketplace"". It neither shows, however, how to overturn conventions or how to shake up the marketplace."
4,a small book to treasure,"Thomas Merton is one of my favorite seekers of Truth...although, he was a devout Trappist monk, his vision went beyond his monastery, to embrace insights from the East, whilst mantaining his own position...if you are looking for a scholarly translation or intro to the Chinese philosopher, Chuang Tzu, look elsewhere...this is rather a free interpretation from one who identified with him, sharing some common perspectives, although both were from two very different monastic traditions...you wil not find the complete chuang Tzu here but rather small selections that will be richer with repeated readings..."
1,Just what the heck is being promoted here?,"I don't quite know what to make of this...""toy."" Knobby balls that apparrently bounce and hop in all manner of unknown directions, with a title called ""color my class,"" that is dangerously close to ""color my"" you know what. Then this picture to go along with it, with this very young lass harboring no less than SIX of them? This toy's creator has some serious issues and I would be extremely cautious about buying something like this for a child in my family."
1,Just the facts madam.,"I read this type of book for the facts, not to be entertained with war stories. This book is all stories that adds up to less than a page of facts. Read the preview, that is what the whole book is like."
1,Bad Clutch,Today 5/24 I'm returning my 4th drill in a month due to the cheap clutch Dewalt uses in this drill. My old Dewalt lasted 7 years and a complete home remodel before giving up.
1,Major clutch slipping problems,"Contrary to most of the other reviews, i've had the opposite problem w/the 983. The cluth is constantly slipping. The first couple of times that i used it, i had no problems. But the last couple of times of use, i've had to go with my old milwaukee to complete the project because the clutch was slipping so badly on the DeWalt. Torque setting or speed makes no diffrence. This was the first DeWalt drill that i have purchased, and will definately be the last. Drill is still under warrenty, so maybe i will not be out [the money]. I would not recommend this drill to anyone. Save yourself some frustation and go with a Milwaukee or Makita."
3,Poor chuck mount and gear selector make for a weak showing,"With Bosch being made in Mexico, and Porter Cable in Taiwan, I was left with two brands: Milwaukee and DeWalt. I chose the DeWalt because of the third gear. I got the unit home, charged it up, and placed a bit holder and bit in the chuck, pulled the trigger and noticed a considerable amount of wobble. If you are looking for an accurate drill to make clean holes, or drive screws without the bit slipping out of the head, this is not it, others have mentioned the same.Second, the gear selector gets jammed, and is not as fluid as it should be. A minor quibble, but enough to make me return it for the Milwaukee 0516-22. Now that's a power tool! It has 10 less lbs of torque (negligible), but the chuck on this unit is beautiful. If you absolutely do not need the third gear on the DeWalt, the Milwaukee is a far better tool. It's made in Germany where precision is a top priority, which clearly shows."
4,More heavy weight fights!,"Kimo, once again an excellent performance, but losing the fight. Kosahka is fantastic, he should face Belfort or Shamrock. What happened with the Bohlander/Shamrock middle weight final fight?."
5,Excellent PDA Case,"I've owned one of these cases for about 5 years, and it's finally time to get a new one. I first had a Handspring Visor Deluxe, then a Handspring Visor Neo, and now have a Garmin iQue 3600 in the case. I originally had the Visor Deluxe belt-clip case made by Handspring, and lost the whole thing. I have never had the Targus case fall off. It has worn extremely well and still looks great. The belt clip is just as tight as it was when new.I'm not sure why people are having problems with the belt clip; perhaps they have a thicker than normal belt. Targus does make a ballistic nylon PDA case with a belt loop, model CHUS01, which should fit any kind of belt."
2,Belt Clip Broke,"Its a nice basic leather case - great for quick access to your pilot/handspring, but i've just owned this case for about a month and the belt-clip broke off today. I just emailed Targus about getting it repaired...hopefully its not a hassle."
4,Love Poems to Live By,LOVE Poems is a very interesting poem book that can be enjoyable for anyone. Nikki did a great job at capturing the essence and spirit of Love. I love her earlier works and I love these pieces just as much. I enjoyed every poem in the book.
5,Product works,"Very cheap replacement for other PSP chargers, I'm just confused why anyone would buy an expensive charger with a brick attatched when this is smaller, cheaper, more convenient, and does the same job. Great product."
3,Needs a longer wire.,"Simply put, it does work as advertised. Leave your psp to charge for awhile and come back later. However it isn't designed to allow constant play with the wire as short as it is."
1,Wish it would work correctly,"would not illuminate... called seller, he sent another one and it still doesn't illuminate. Yes; I've had it in the direct sun for the 8-10 hours. For some reason the batteries won't charge. Oh well, live and learn. I can't recommend it for that reason."
4,Delicious!,"A lovely warm, funny, cosy book to read when you need cheering up,makes you want to make a cup of tea or coffee and read it in one sitting. A book full of real people doing real things.In a word - DELICIOUS!"
3,Pretty Good,"There were times in this book where I wished Ruth would grow a back bone! With that aside, the book was cute and entertaining. I loved reading about her making the cakes. I could totally get involved in the process. Liked the recipes at the back of the book. I may have to make a couple!"
4,Mid-Life Trials and Romance,"This is a charming little book that shows how a woman copes by baking cakes. In fact, the ""safe"" place she goes in her mind when under stress is inside a nice warm cake. Ha! The plot is fairly predictable, but it's a nice little story about coping with middle-age and family life. The characters are all lovingly flawed, although exceptional human beings. It's a fun read."
2,Typical woman in mid-life crisis book,"I read this for a book club I am in. Didn't really enjoy it. Too much emphasis on woman in mid-life crisis. I wanted fiction, not psychology of life."
4,My First but not my last!,This was my first book by this author and I will be putting this author on my list of books to read. Fast paced great summer read.
5,The Hard Way was a fast read and Reacher is back!,"First, I admit I am a true fan of Lee Child and his Jack Reacher series.... I've even read the short story with Reacher in it. It is not his best but it's still worthy of reading... and I'm sure I'll read it again before the next book in the series is released.Jack Reacher is still a flawed but honorable man..... I didn't quite get the constant references to 'Mirror on a stick' and thought the book might have been better without them....and I was disappointed that the other 9.5 million dollars wasn't retrieved for use in reparations....I wish we didn't have to wait so long between books... I'm anxious now for the next episode..."
2,Slow and Boring!,This is the worst of Lee Child. I really enjoyed all of his other books except this one and I am quite surprised that others found it enjoyable. There is zero action and suspense until the very end of the story and what little action there finally is is quite tame compared to his other books.
2,Up and Downs,"I read this series because I consistently enjoy Jack Reacher. I sometimes do not enjoy Lee Child,however, and this was definitely one of those times. Reacher's comment, could he read The Hard Way, would be unprintable, one feels sure. Smarmy? Reacher? And Child just doesn't seem capable of consistently producing the sparce, driving prose of books like Killing Floor, The Enemy, One Shop. Pitty. When he's good, he's so very, very good. Kind of makes the bad one's hard to forgive."
1,The Hard Way,"I am not sure whatever possessed me to buy this book. Honestly, it was a complete waste of my time. To quote a friend, it was not the best use of my entertainment dollar. If you are a fan of pedestrian writing, lack-luster plots and hackneyed character development, this is your book."
4,Good entry in a great series,"Taut, well written and pacy thriller. A excellent entry in the series but not the best."
4,Jack Reacher,I really enjoy the way this author writes and describes his detail. Jack Reacher is so cool and whatever he does just seem to work out.
4,Good Thriller,"In this novel, Jack Reacher is on the case of a kidnapped mother and daughter. The action swings from New York to rural England. The first time, to the best of my knowledge, that a Jack reacher novel has not been set entirely in the USA.I felt the storyline was good, throughout, and I was hooked from the start. There was always something at the end of each chapter, that would make me want to keep on reading. The characters in it were interesting, too. Having said that, there are better Jack reacher novels out there, but, this one is still very good and certainly worth a read."
5,Re-read,I wish I'd kept the paperback. Good enough to buy again. Classic Reacher. Before he seemed to get so hard and angry.
3,Gateshead composer top of the pops after 200 years,"It may not be everyone's cup of tea but Millennium Prayer went to the top of the UK charts on 27 November 1999. The tune, to which the Lord's Prayer is sang in this song, was composed by William Shield who came from Gateshead in the United Kingdom some 200 years ago."
4,CHARLOTTE GREENWOOD IS FANTASTIC,"Charlotte Greenwood is one of my favourite actors. She was superb in the Cinerama film:The Wonderful Wonderful World Of The Brothers Grimm. Anastasia,Oklahoma, Admirable Chrichton and many more."
3,Uneven collection of shorts,"This is an incredibly uneven of shorties. Some are one to two pages. The Herbert West story is the longest and one of the best at 16 pages. If you are not familiar with HP Lovecraft I am not sure that this is a good representation, other than the Black Cat, which is very reminiscent of Poe's Black Cat and the West Story. There is nothing here that will really give you a flavour of Lovecraft's depth or his renown descriptive abilities other than the title story."
3,Nice guitar for the price/amp is no good,"The guitar is beautiful and built well enough for an adult. For the price I paid I didn't think it would look that good when it arrived. However, the amp has never worked and I've tried repairing it with no luck"
2,"Close, but no cigar","One of the reasons I selected the Palm Vx was for its slender and streamlined style. I liked the way it fit comfortably into my coat pocket without adding too much bulk.With slots for credit cards and businees cards this case represents a great concept. However, after filling each of slots with credit cards and adding some business cards, the case became so bulky that it defeated the entire purpose of owning a streamlined Vx.Also, I found the loop closure very cumbersome and inconvenient."
3,Outdoor lighting timer only,"This looked like exactly what I was looking for: protected outdoor enclosure that would meet current electrical codes; GFCI protection built-in; receptacles; and a timer! But wait, this timer is just for night use! It will turn your lights on at dusk for 2, 4, or 6 hours, or all night, but nothing else. Forget about timing your fountain pump or whatever. If you need something for your nightime lighting, great, but for timing anything else, forget it."
3,"More maturity, but lost some of their oomph","With this album, Sanctus Real definitely shows an increased technical maturity, but they seem to have lost some of the raw power that made them unique. I loved the driving guitars and raw but uplifting lyrics in the last two albums, and this one just doesn't have either of those. It isn't a bad album, but I find myself either getting down or introspective from the lyrics of the songs, or just ignoring the music because it isn't captivating. Unfortunately, I don't listen to it much for those reasons, and find myself going back to the past albums, which always put me in a good mood. I understand that people go through phases, but I hope in their next album they're able to recapture some of the driving optimism and God focus that made them such a great band to listen to."
2,Will the real Sanctus Real please stand up!?!,"This is the most disappointing album I have ever purchased. The first two albums were characterized by upbeat, voluminous guitar distortion which fueled the soul. Unfortunately, in most of the songs on this album, the guitars took a back seat to subpar vocals. Gone are the beautiful and intricate sounds and high production quality.This album is clearly about trying to ""rebrand"" Sanctus Real to appeal to a larger CCM listener base. But unfortunately, this has alienated me and no doubt countless other fans. I just can't see how one can love the earliers albums along with the current one. Aside from ""I'm not alright"" and perhaps if I stretch ""Trying"" this album did not live up to expectations."
4,Different but good,"This album is quite different from the first two albums from Sanctus Real. It is more darker, more emotional and less upbeat but it contains the best songwriting from the band so far as they address personal issues and events. Fav tracks are 'I'm not alright', 'Don't Give up' and 'Benjamin'"
2,Hardly &#65533;essential&#65533;.,"Great book if you're a manager and you want to understand every 3rd word of what your tech geek is saying.Good book if you haven't the slightest idea what a network is. You'll still need a tech geek to set it up.Terrible book if you're a tech geek. Doesn't give any information about configuring networks or troubleshooting. Plus the hardware is changing so rapidly that I'm not sure a technical guide in a book would be of any real use. Even the hardware companies refer you to their websites for current information.A friend in the biz gave a copy to me. He probably thought it was a waste of space on his bookshelf...If you're just starting out, visit PracticallyNetworked on the web. It's free and much more up to date."
4,Had the player for about 3 months now... my 2 cents.,"1) The 3 hour battery life is not too bad. I usually carry around an extra pack of batteries with me.2) I do appreciate that the player can read Joliet long filenames, unlike others which read only ISO9660.3) The resume features have been touchy. Sometimes (at random) the player would resume at the beginning of the track or sometimes at the exact position i turned it off.4) My main problem with the player is, for some reason, the battery would drain when left in the player, as if the player was on all along. I emailed philips about this problem, but I still have not gotten a response. I don't know if this is a common problem with others, but it's a major drawback with mine.5) If have any other questions, feel free to email me."
4,Pocket eXpanium delivers!,"Overall, I liked the simplicity of the product, its portability, the coolness factor, and the sound quality is above average. I'm very happy with it, and so far it hasn't given me any problems. It may not be able to display MP3 ID3 tags but who's got the time to look at, much less read scrolling text, when you're running or working out? This portable mp3/mini-cd player delivers the goods very well, and that's the bottom line. For next year's model, I strongly suggest longer battery life."
5,wonderful,we are very pleased with this item.it is sturdy and easy to hang. Only down side is they do not include hardware to hang it from ceiling so we had to purchase 2 planter hooks and some chain. you might not need chain if your beams are exactly over the brackets ours werent hense the extra chain. but we are happy with screen it was just an inconvenience to have to run out to the store and get stuff they could have included for the money we spent. pet peeve i guess
1,Read with caution,"One can read this book 'cause there are not many others available - Western publishing houses publish mostly accounts by Western journalists. This author collected a lot of sources and hearsay but shows inability to fully understand the truth. Hence come inaccuracies, sensationalism, outright mistakes. As an insider of Russian politics and knowing Mr.B personally I would advise to discount his importance by 40% and not believe all facts stated. Still, one can get a partial picture of our infortunate situation."
4,A work that is now even more important,"Any question about the accurcy of this author's research, or the validity of his conclusions?Mr. Klebnikov's horrific murder establishes clearly how important it was to silence his attempts to get at the truth. Libel suits were insufficient. Villifying attacks on his character by critics, who served as defenders of the faith for the new reign of oligarchs residing (at least part of the time) in Russia, were not enough. This was an assasination, and a patent warning to anyone who would dare to expose the mottled monied corruption of Russia's select few ""capitalists"".Mr. Klebnikov's work will ensure that his life, and death, had meaning. His murder ensures that someone will pick up the lantern and refuse to be shooed away with suits, smear, or assaults."
1,Where's the beef?,"I was looking forward to reading a grand tale of the ""Rape of Russia"" but instead got this collection of first person and mostly unattributed second person anecdotes by someone who has been in a long-standing legal dispute with the subject of his biography. If I'd known this before buying this nasty book, I would have taken pause; it's a little like buying a biography of George W. Bush by Tipper Gore!The facts presented by Paul Klebnikov don't even strike me as being particularly well-researched. When he states that Berezovky ""rose out of nowhere to become the richest businessman in Russia and one of the most powerful individuals in the country"" he seems to forget that Boris Berezovky was quite a well-known and powerful figure in Russian academic and political circles well before Perestroika--he wasn't exactly a businessman from ""nowhere."" This rather breathless tone dominates the book, and undermines the credibility of what could have been a fascinatingly sinister story."
2,keys are too hard & heavy,"My son got these for a gift. He's 4 months old and loves to reach for and pick up other small toys, but these keys are too big for his hands. They are heavy too, he can hardly hold on to the ring when they are all on. I tried hooking the ring to the diaper bag when I was doing errands, but the ring is flimsy and lets the keys slip off. The keys look cute, but aren't fun for him. I don't recommend them."
3,Too heavy,"This is my first review. My daughter got these for Christmas and she is now 4.5 months old. She still can't lift them comfortably as a group. I think they are too heavy and clumsy for the age group they are listed for. 6+months might have been better. She's hit her self in the face trying to lift them and, trust me, that is not a pretty sight. I agree that the white ring they are on does not stay shut and they fall off all the time as well."
4,game for homeschoolers,"This is a fun, low tech game with historic roots. I put it on my coffee table to see if my home-schooled grandchildren would enjoy it. Since I think they are electronic game ""addicts"", imagine my joy when I heard their banter while enthusiastically playing my ""Shut The Box"" game. Am hoping they are equally thrilled when they open their own ""Shut The Box"" game on Christmas.I had to download the game rules from the internet. No big deal, but would be nice to have them included with each game."
2,Drill works great for 4 months and thats it,This is my second Dewalt drill the first one was in the 5 Combo Pack. All of the other dewalt tools work great to this day but the darn drill broke with in 4 months. When I bought the second drill I needed some more batteries so I bought dewalt again. Once again a couple months later the drill started acting up. I would pull the trigger and it would operate at half speed like the battery was dead. I am done with dewalt drills.
2,Adequate Torque But Too Damn Heavy,"I'm a contractor. I lift heavy things all day long, so I'm no 90lb weakling. But, I have to admit, I sold this tool after three months because I found it too heavy and cumbersome for all day use. The torque was adequate, but I find my 12v Porter Cable drill equally up to the task at a fraction of the weight. (Unfortunately, the chuck on the P/C drills are a total piece of crap, which is a whole other story!) Oh, this drill is fine for driving a few screws here and there, or the occasional heavy duty drilling tasks. But due to their weight and size, I now believe 18v drills in general are not versatile enough for professionals to use on a full day-to-day basis. In fact, many other contractors and builders I know have also dumped their 18v+ drills for lighter, smaller 12v and even 9.6v models. Plus, whenever I need a little extra power, I just pull out my 1/2"" Milwaukee Hammer Drill, plug it in, and bombs away!!"
2,"A Glorified Workbook, Nothing More","Taches d'encre is merely a glorified workbook. It probably cost $2.00 to print. The publishers must be making a huge profit. Additionally, the book is not even very well written. Albeit, the book is not horrible, but if any professors are reading this review, please do not make your students purchase a book that is this expensive. Any good French professor can create his or her own handouts and paper prompts that are just as effective for students."
4,Marvelous children's book,"Bobo is a young orangutan who discovers a violin in the jungle and learns to play it. Tragedy strikes when a crocodile eats it; Bobo's father visits Uncle Darwin and brings back a variety of replacement ""music makers."" None of the other musical instruments satisfies Bobo, so his father takes him to see Uncle Darwin's cave of mysterious treasures for himself. They do end up finding another violin, which Bobo plays. The story is well-written and the wonderful illustrations add volumes. I would not have thought it possible to draw a young orangutan playing the violin in such a way that the playing position is actually fairly accurate and the orangutan is irresistable. My 19-month-old son is riveted by the pictures, and loves to find Bobo and/or his violin on each page; the somewhat older children it is written for will enjoy it as well. I highly recommend this book!"
5,Strange ventures in Synchronicity,"Watch your step, and remember what the tele says. Witchcraft can be harmful to health. Openning up to the femeine can lead to distressing situations. Mabyr even complete insanity. I believe the bible. I watch the news. Magick is bad. Synchronicity is ""God's will"" we have no control over our own fate.But seriously though, sorry for the sarcasm. I don't mean to offend anyone, except (???). This is a truly intriguing little love story. I mean it's a journey into an ongoing attempt by the planet earth to recruit vertically stable mid-wives. I mean It's a detailed account of the impact of the Harmonic Convergence of 1987. Wait no It's a story about interstellar alien space beings accepting earth surrender rites to spare 11% of it's population from the great collapse. Or does this detail the carreer of an aspiring writer/cyber-punk of new age cultural back ground. Well what ever this book is about, give me a couple more reads and mabye I'll get it. Der huh."
5,Uros Petrovic YU,"Ovo je stvarno dobra knjiga koju nazalostnisam procitao :))).Ali kad je procitam cu sigurno da se zacudim kako je neko mogao da napise takvo sranje. Glupost nad glupostima.!!!!Mozda je knjiga i dobra ali ja za nju para nemam,dobra za gubljjne vremena"
5,Entertaining!,My 9 month old son loves these blocks. On each one there are things that spin and can be moved. He is teething and also likes to chew on the push button on each block. Great toy!
4,Good,"I got these for my 9m old for Christmas. Of course I couldn't resist from giving them to him right away. They live in the toy drawer that he is always digging through. They make an apprearance at least once or twice a day, and get a couple minutes of playing time each time."
2,Stickers come off too easy,"I bought these blocks for my 11 month old son for Christmas. I gave them to him to play with the next morning. After about 1 minute (literally), he was able to pull off one of the stickers on the blocks whole and eat it. I was able to retreive some of it from his mouth. He swallowed the rest. I called Fisher Price and put in a complaint. I am not thrilled with the idea that the stickers came off that quickly and have returned this item."
2,Fair,thank you for this wonderful gift. This will make a great and wonderful gift family/ friend enjoyed and will enjoy watching
1,disappointing and disturbing,"I had high expectations from a love story which looked complicated on paper, but honestly I found it disturbing and a bit disappointing. The characters of Sam, Tessa and Allie are written well but the love triangle seems to be stuck in the past for ever and then it is suddenly resolved out of nowhere. It seemed the classic approach of appreciating something more when you are about to lose it. I still fail to understand the marriage and how it worked so long with this major baggage. I guess I just did not like it. The ridiculous way to add a third romantic interest so that everyone is happy is a bit of a letdown too."
2,Not all the characters were likable,"I saw the great reviews, and I really wanted to like this, but I did not like Allison or Sam. Neither character seemed to take Tessa's feelings into account, all they seemed to do was make poor excuses about why they betrayed her. I wish the book would have concentrated more on Tessa, and spent less time on Sam and Allison."
3,So-so,"I enjoy Barbara Freethy's writing style. It's light, easy to follow and the plot is interesting in this one: two sisters fighting for the same men. It was just very, very hard to like the characters because they were so annoying! The younger sister, after seducing her sister's boyfriend came across as insecure and whiny. She was too busy justifying her actions than truly trying to fight for her marriage. How many men would actually put up with that, no matter how honorable they are? The older sister, even after seeing how conflicted the younger sister was about the marriage, still thought she had a shot with the ex-boyfriend after being apart for many years because 'it's her first love'. Come on! So much for sisterly love. Overall, it's an OK book. I will still read books from the author because she is a good story teller."
4,What I expected,I always like the read these books when I want something light and it did the trick. I quite liked the storyline although it was a little far fetched! All in all a good book if you're after some chick lit.
2,The Way You Are,"This book is very ordinary and predictable. Not worth ones's time to read it, I do not think anyone who reads worth while books would want to read this one."
4,Ouch,"All I can say is I just had to finish this book so... It's almost 1am, my eyes are sore and my nose is runny. Just make sure you're staying in the next day and get a box of tissues. ;-)"
5,Great and Wonderful Read...,I really enjoyed this book! Kept me interested to see what would happen next... make sure you finish to see who gets the pearls!!! :)
3,So so,"This book was nothing special to me, it revolves around a man and 2 disputing sisters and a sick grandmother. It was just okay for me."
2,Disappointing,"This book COULD have been a vital link between disciplines--anthropology, cultural theory, sociology and linguistics. Instead one gets the vague sense of incohesiveness from the work as a whole.But that problem is eclipsed by another more insidious one--the book has countless spelling, syntax and general native language interference errors, to the point that even the most sympathetic reader mistrusts the message as well as its execution. A shame; I had great hopes for this book. One expects better from this press, which has produced such useful texts as Jack Child's Introduction to Spanish Translation.Translators, translations theorists and their students are not alone in being discriminating readers, but they are especially so, and deserve better."
1,Really poor quality,"The quality of this shoe is really bad. The ""leather"" feels like cardboard, the tongue is held on by some flimsy cloth, just flops around. They would be trash after the first time worn. Bargain basement shoes are better. They are going right back. Thankfully Amazon has free returns on them."
1,So NOT the Australian Idol,"It was a sign of how far Australia has come when they voted Guy Sebastian the winner of Australian Idol over this ""Aussie Bloke"". Whilst I don't have an issue with the kind of person Shannon seems to be, or the fact that his blend of Aussie-Country-Rock has it's fans, it is insulting to the Australian public and the talent of Guy to list this CD as the Australian Idol Winner (with or without a question mark). If you want some standard Aussie country rock, and aren't too fussed with pitch, diction or tone - buy this album. If not, and you want to experience the best that Australia has to offer - buy Guy Sebastian's ""Just As I Am"" (which can also be purchased through Amazon."
2,At least is not Michael Bay!,"Hollywood made in Finland. In the sense of small budget independent-like Hollywood. A little tale, overlong but lightweight, about a crazy father and four sons that looks like they've come out from a Coen Bros. movie. When you think that there's a corny moment and in any minute you're going to listen to violins, they appear (or pop music, is the same thing). At the beginning of the film there is an overdose of jump-cuts that make the experience over conscious, to say the least. Some scenes could indicate some indictment of the culture of consumism, but more could be said about ""Dawn of the Dead"", at that film doesn't amount to much either. Finland is a strange country: there doesn't seem to be a crime problem, but is expected from young men to be somewhat violent, maybe because of the alcohol. They don't act very different from Israelis, but their houses are nicer (like in Patagonia)."
2,Slow and unreliable,"This drive came with my computer in 2001. It worked okay for several years, although it became slower with time. One day it just refused to boot. I was lucky to be able to connect it peripherally to my computer at work and recover my data. But it is worrisome to have your drive just fail suddenly. Admittedly, this happened after 5 years of service, so it might be within the expected life span of a hard drive."
1,Noisy and Not so Reliable,This HardDrive came with my Dell PC. Both were noisy and the last one crashed. Maybe it is my luck but I am not getting another one.
5,worked as descried,"The drive was sold at a good price and was very easy to install and worked as described. What more can I say, it's an internal hard drive for a desktop PC. The price was good and the drive worked and installed easily."
4,Great Product,I love this product. It is very well made. Looks expensive. I have had more than 5 people at my office who asked me where I got it. Perfect size for my Palm IIIc. Recommended.
3,Great resource for the seriouss practitioner,"The first several chapters of this book seemed something of a waste of space to me. While information like the generic ""models of reality"" may be great for beginners, by and large, this book distinguishes itself as a quick reference book for a more experienced magician. I would have rather seen more info presented about specific traditions and schools such as wicca, alchemy, kabala, spiritism, etc. and a more complete dictionary of magical symbols used by these variouss traditions. That said, this is a great book, giving the practitioner or potential practitioner an over-view of the entire occult world while freeing up space on one's bookshelf for works addressing one's specific field of interest. I highly recommend it to everyone involved in paganism, heathenism, witchcraft, or the occult."
3,Defective Clutch,I too have found a defect in this product's design. The clutch does not work in the low (high torque) speed. This is the speed you most need the clutch. Other than that a nice product. For the price it should work as advertised!
2,Why would she put up with his treatment of her?,"This was the first Elizabeth Lowell I read and I was absorbed by it. I did enjoy her writing style and thought that some of her images were almost poetic; for example, sailing a boat across the incandescent eye of God. However, I wonder whether Cat has any self-respect at all. How could she go back to someone who attempted repeatedly to buy her affection and her time, called her a whore, attempted to buy their child, abandoned her and left her flat on her back in bed, and thinks that money can buy anything? She should have told him to take a hike--or rather, a sail. Being called a whore by someone you love is the equivalent of physical violence and is absolutely not acceptable under any circumstances. This problem marred what otherwise would have been a fine book. And why the heck was she supporting her ditsy mother? Couldn't her ""green angel"" have put some pressure on the rich friend who was going to marry her in a few months?"
2,Great grovel at the end of a REALLY bad book......,"I only give this book two stars because it has a really long, protracted grovel scene at the end that could have only been improved upon by the heroine dumping the bum anyway. Oh well. The rest of the book was so bad it was painful to read....the whole Cathy, Cat, Kitten, claws, scratching references...ugh!And the TSTL heroine is overworked, underfed and sleep deprived in part to pay for her mother's wedding? I had no sympathy for her at all.Dialog between the main characters was so unrealisitic, one of the worst I have ever read."
5,WOW .... more please,"Just discovered this author - written a while ago but with Kindle all these ""Old"" authors are being discovered by me. Loved it. Very atmospheric, beautifully written - OK Travis is a bit of a dog with some of the things he says to Cat but sure we all love a mean-ass hero (at least I do) especially when they redeem themselves in the end. Off to check out some more of Ms Lowell's work."
5,This has got it all,"I loved this book! I, like others, stayed up all night on Friday reading it and after I woke up on Saturday I read the whole thing again. (I'm not kidding you)This book was about two grown-up, independent people, who fell in love at first sight and were terrified by it. Ok sounds pretty human to me. They have misunderstandings that come about from a lack of communication and once they realize it, they TALK about it. They talk about it like adults, not stupid romance novel characters. It was really refreshing!Combine a great story (ok maybe a little overly dramatic but that's what we read romance for anyway) with a really great romance, some very steamy scenes, and good writing and you have a gem of a novel.Thumbs up!"
2,a Sympathy basket. Not really!,Did not correspond to the picture on the web site. This was supposed to be a sympathy basket. The basket was not the same as in picture (inferior basket). It had a bright yellow ribbon and bright orange leaves inside the basket. The food in the basket was fine.
3,Heavy Pail has a boo-boo factor,"I got the Fisher-Price Ocean Wonder Pails for my 6 month old son. He likes to toss the small pails around to chase after them. The largest pail is very heavy and he dropped it on himself. The other two, smailler pails and the ball are great for babies to play with and have little things inside the rim and on the bottom to look at and play with."
3,Very durable,"This is a nice, durable toy, but it is pretty heavy, so if you've got the type of kiddo who likes to fling things around, beware."
3,not workout friendly,This product is fine if you are not using it in the gym. My sweat ran down the cord and into the unit ruining the electric components. Having AM/FM stations along with you own library of media was nice.
2,Our knob too broke off,I'm on line trying to find a replacement for our now-discontinued V-2800 tripod. The crank broke after limited use.
2,very weak...,I just used it one time... But it's knob was broken...I can't understand how can it be happend...
3,nice but not on par with other Tivoli products,"Adds nice, SUBTLE, bass amplification. Unless you really listen for it, you won't notice. This is not a unit for thumping bass - it just drops the frequency range a tad.Styling and quality is nice.Don't hide it away or under furniture because, unless you switch it off first (don't rely on its own Automatic setting), it will put out a really loud thumping sound if the source powers off first. We have it in our bedroom connected to a Model Two radio and I have to remember to reach under the bed and turn the subwoofer off first.We like it but, compared to the numerous other Tivoli products we own, it's the only piece of Tivoli gear that I can't whole heartedly recommend."
5,TIGHT-A@@-SHI@ THIS IS REALEST DOG 4-SURE !!!!,"YO, IF YOU'RE EVER GONNA FIND A REAL RAPPER WELL LOOK NO MORE CAUSE DMX IS THE REALEST RAPPER OUT THERE. I PER-SONALLY THINK HE IS THE BEST EVER.NO-BODY COULD EVER BE AS REAL AS HIM SOSUPPORT THIS DOG CAUSE HIS THE BEST.BY: ""BIG"" MIKE RIVERA whatz up and peaceout!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,"Mellow, melodious music",Beautiful music from a beautiful instrument. Glass notes float down from the sky. The piece by Bach is notable
2,Get me off this boat!,"I loved book one of this series and was quite excited to purchase book #2. It's an incredible let down. Slow to the point of not moving, and the characters just don't act true. We take a long, slow, boring, boat ride to China with the dragon. It's brutal in the detail. The author tries to stir up something interesting by having some assassination attempts but never really follows through with them. Most of the characters just shrug, oh well, nothing we can do about it. REALLY?I got about half way through the book and put it down. I just couldn't make myself plow through anymore. Very disappointing."
5,Also a great book,"I loved the first, I loved this one,and I'm reading (and enjoying) the third in the series."
3,Throne of Jade,"Enjoyable read -- not deep or thought provoking, but a very easy read for the summer. I read it during down time on travel off the Kindle -- excellent for stop and start reading."
3,good but with a few flaws.....,"while Throne of Jade was a good book, it was not as good as book one in the series. There seemed to be less interaction between Temeraire and Lawerence-which was a big attraction of the first book. That vacancy made the book drag a bit for the first 100 pages, and in the middle. Luckily, the engaging, dramatic, and moving parts of the story are done very well, so you want to finish the story.Book Two doesn't throw me off wanting to read later books, but I'd only suggest it to fans of the series, as you do get some vital information about Temeraire that I'm sure will prove important in later books. So, I'd only recommend book 2 for fans of the series, as I'm sure it would be confusing for anyone to follow as a stand alone book. 3.5 stars."
5,THIS STUFF ALMOST WORKS TO GOOD,"THIS STUFF WORKS ALMOST TO GOOD. AFTER USING THIS CARNITINE FOR ABOUT 2 WEEKS, I WOKE UP TO GET READY FOR WORK ONE MORNING, AND LOOKED IN THE MIRROR AND ALMOST SCARED MYSELF, I WAS SO RIPPED AND TOTALLY LEAN.VEIN AND MUSCLE STRIATIONS WERE CLEARLY VISIABLE, THIS STUFF WORKS WHEN YOU DO HIIT CARDIO ALONG WITH KETTLEBELL WORKOUTSS"
4,Let's see results,"Great product, arrived as describedStill to see results, savor is incredible, if this works as the pills so it will be unique"
5,Great pre-workout formula,I use this before I workout to P90X and Turbfire and it gives me energy through the roof! I will keep using this product as long as I need an energy boost from fat cells. This is also the cheapest price per quantity out there. Highly recommended!
4,Very comparable ; )',"We usually purchase another brand of L-Carnitine that is Rasberry flavored, which we liked very much. Thiswas a pleasant change in flavor & a great savings in price will definitely order again!"
1,Leaking container,"The bottle arrived leaking and improperly sealed. When I reported this problem the first time to the seller, I got zero response/feedback.I sent a photo, etc.I wanted a refund because I can't use this product.But no response.Terrible service."
2,L carnitine liquid,"it makes my stomach upset 10-15 min after i take it and i didnt like the taste, i have to drink water to wash the after taste of it. some people say that this product gives them a boost of energy but i didnt feel energized at all. but then again, every body reacts differently to any food/substance we take in. I changed to the pill/tablet form"
3,Dog Bed,"I purchased two of these beds to take to ""camp"" for boarding when we're on vacation. I had to take the cedar chips out. The smell was overwhelming.I replaced the cedar chips with standard size pillows.The felt-like backing is a fur grabber. It is almost impossible to get all of the fur off of it. These are fine for the boarding facility, but not for everyday use."
3,Uneven prosecutor's brief,"A lawyer takes local and state government to task. Kinda like a journalist taking the federal government to task (Bovard's books). Both these guys write adversarial briefs, selectively picking and chosing their material to paint a picture. Useful propaganda, since I support zero government (you can privitize everything, including the military, post office, justice, etc).One example from page 8, which you can check out on-line: Federal expenditures are listed as less than $1 trillion, which is less than state and local expenditures, but in fact federal expenditures are greater than $2 trillion. So how did the author get away with this statistic? Easy. He stripped out ""entitlements"" like Social Security, Medicare, which account for roughly half of federal expenditures.This is but one example.In short: useful propaganda, but nothing more."
1,Not worth it.,"We chose this stroller because we were looking for something that was easily maneuverable. We walked all around the store with it - but there's the problem. The store is perfectly flat and even. The stroller pitches forward any time we hit any kind of bump - we don't even like it on the sidewalk, let alone anywhere else. It is dangerous!In short, this stroller is perfect for mall-walking. Nothing else."
5,Great Perspective,"Fergus Kerr gives us a very much needed overview of twentieth century Catholic theology both before and after Vatican II. It is especially needed because too many, on both the theological ""left"" and ""right,"" tend to distort the state of the Church at the time of Vatican II. On the one hand, theological liberals often tend to view the state of the Church as dire just before Vatican II. On the other hand, some theological traditionalists tend to view the Church just before Vatican II as being a utopia. Neither caricature is accurate. Kerr gives us the balance that comes from seeking out history, instead of making it up for ideological reasons. Especially good is Kerr's treatment of the great French theologians who were intent on the reform of the Church before Vatican II."
4,KOBE!,"I will rate this game a 4 out of 5 stars. This game is a must have if your a basketball fan. You can do some awesome dunks over people and stuff it back at them. There is brilliant dribbling moves, post ups, and alley oops. Theres arcade mode where its almost like NBA StreeT. I rate it a 4 because the defense is hard to play. But you still must get."
2,Not as good as NBA Live 2002,"I have to admit that when I got this game I was so excited to see the great new graphics. Well, as soon as I started playing it I was disappointed. The players look hunched over and their movements and actions are less than smooth. The game is also unrealistic. When was the last time that you saw Steve Nash slam one home over Shaq? I have played NBA Live 2002 for PS2 and the graphics are smoother (especially their jersyes) and the actions more realistic. And what about a franchise mode for once, hey Kobe? I was diappointed to say the least."
2,Tepid Tepper,"This slight, so-called novel is deftly written and uncommonly humorous for fifty pages or so, but then falls victim to a ho-hum story line and predictable, flat ending.Its most intriguing question-- Why does Murray Tepper spend so much time in his parked car?-- never seems to get answered, though the Trillinesque brand of humor would not seem to preclude the attempt.One probably will have to look hard to find a character in a current novel as potentially as interesting as Murray Tepper-- and as sketchily delineated.I like Murray Tepper immensely, and applaud Trillin's choice of subject mastter, but at the story's end I am left with a sense of loss, and repeating to myself: ""Murray, we hardly knew ye.""Tepper seemed happiest when alone in his car, waving by disgruntled motorists who wanted his spot.I am left wishing the author had somehow developed the reader's understanding of Tepper more fully-- or let him stay there."
4,The Inscrutable Tepper,I would recommend this book to anyone who lives near a major city and who has to contend with the rather byzantine rules regarding parking their car.This is a very funny novel. I highly recommend it.
2,"Nice to have, not my favorite","I really liked the spatula tool when I first got it. It's a lot better than trying to use my fingernails to get the paper off the sticky mat. But if the paper is delicate, or a delicate design, it crinkles the paper, and doesn't keep it nice. I also feel that it scrapes off some of the stickiness of the mat, so it doesn't last as long. Later I bought the cricut 'tool set' (not sure if that's exactly what it's called) but I like it a TON better! The tools are smaller and work Great! If I would have known, I would have bought those only and not the spatula at all."
3,cricut spatula,This item was a gift. I can only review the speed in which I receved it to give. It came just in time for the birthday
3,"Does the job, but could use some improvement","Although having an ultra thin spatula is a must when using the Cricut, I find that this product could use some improvement. During the first use, I already noticed how the spatula would also pick up the adhesives from the mat, and that's probably not good for the longevity of my mat. Also, I would prefer that the spatula blade be longer, especially when working with a larger piece. But for the price on Amazon, it's better than buying this tool at a craft store."
5,Cricket Supplies,I got this to help my daughter take the image off of the cutting mat while my daughter was cutting more items. We work together like that. We both love the cricket machine. But seeing it is her machine she controls that. Will deferentially re order cricket items again.
4,Good Product,This product is good! Did just as the description said and works very well with my circut! I am pleased with this product.
5,If you own cricut you must have!!,It is a must if you have a cricut. I didn't have one at first but I love using it!! It is so much asier to remove smaller items off the mat.
3,"Mandatory accessory for 3d printers, but breaks within 3 months","Loved the spatula at first, it made it extremely easy to remove printed small-medium 3d parts from klapton tape....however, the metal of the spatula isn't that strong and just breaks after a few months of use."
3,Too much surface area--gets sticky,"I love my Cricut, but this spatula really isn't worth the money. It was to designed to help you remove what's been cut off of the Cricut mats, and while it does help you do this, it also picks up a lot of the sticky adhesive from the mats, which can then interfere with the effectiveness of the tool for future cuts. I tried to clean it with finger nail polish remover (what I always use to clean stickers off anything) but it never really was like new again. Additionally, with normal use, the large spatula area became bent. I prefer my Creative Memories tool, that has much less surface area and does a better job of picking up my beautiful letters from the mats. My friends prefer using the ""hook"" tool that comes in the Cricut tool set.Cricut 29-0004 7-Piece Tool Kit for Cricut Cutting Machines"
5,Cricut spatula tool,"This little tool is all I hoped it would be. Just one word of advice in ordering any product online: make sure you realize how much it will cost including shipping and handling, so you don't get any rude surprises."
1,my spactual broke!!!!!!!!!!,The product was bent but it was still useable after a week it split where it was bent the metal part meets the rubber part i still use the little metal part with out the handle
5,Cricut Spaula - Scrapbooking,Highly recommend this great tool for removing die cuts from the Cricut adhesive sheet. The price is a plus also!!
1,"I Can make a Better movie then this, all I Need is some Cheep Hookers.",I rather see b movies from Japan. To bad I cant get a refund or credit towards another movie that make me happy.
5,Beautiful Story!,"I have read all of Barbara Freethy's books, and i think this is my favorits. The dialoge in this book is unbelievable. I Loved the character's, they were fun, witty, sarcastic, and so human. I am definetly re-reading this book!!"
1,very disappointed,"The beginning of this novel had so much promise...mystery, family secrets, a new relationship...but it really went downhill after the two main characters starting sleeping together. Sure, there was chemistry, but let's be honest, people getting married after knowing each other for a week just doesn't happen. And if it does, they end up like the Kardashians."
3,A nice read,"This is a nice romance filled with likeable, down-to-earth characters. The storyline is at times humourous, and at others, touching and moving. The author manages to keep you interested as she weaves her tale and takes you to the anticipated happy ending.Overall, an enjoyable bit of light reading, with a touch of the paranormal."
5,THE TITLE SAYS IT ALL!,"This is a definite keeper! I've treasured every one of Ms. Freethy's exceptional romantic novels about the compelling power of true love, the healing gifts of reconciliation, and the challenges and rewards of family. Each one is truly memorable in its own right. She never disappoints, and she has another absolute winner with this poignant and heartwarming tale of an unlikely pair who have ""parenthood"" unexpectedly thrust upon them. I read it from cover to cover in one sitting. SOME KIND OF WONDERFUL is irresistible from beginning to end with just the right splashs of humor and a hero who is bound to run away with your heart. Grab this one!"
1,I almost didn't finish this book,"I really like the Power Play series. Its hero, Rodger Gordian, seems like a great example of a concerned businessman. Roger who? His appearances in this book were at best unnecessary. Or mabe it as necessary for him to play a REAL part in the plot instead of trying to build a wall at his retirement home. This book was just plain awful. I was more than half way through it and realized that I didn't even know what it was about. A salesman gets killed. Why? I don't know. His girlfriend gets killed. Why? I don't know. Somebody has some incredible gem stones and is worried about where they came from. Why? I don't know. And so it goes. I agree with other reviewers that this book could have been a very credible short story. Either that of we should have been told earlier why whatever was supposed to happen was so allegedly dangerous. Sorry, I really wanted to like this book, but I didn't and recommend that you don't buy it. Not worth it."
5,American Diesel Locomotives,If your into trains and I am this book is a must for every railroad buff you won't find a better one.
2,A Poor waste of time and money-,"This book was not very informative, and wasn't much morethan an author's personal flag waving about the facts thatmaking packages are possible. The book comes without the cd,no code dump's/listings, and much worse, doesn't reallycompile most of the time. The content is confusing at best,and I was quite frustrated that the author was audaciousenough to put the name Java on the cover. Not even good asa reference-Don't let the cover image fool you, the author should stickto cover design, ...if that.Take some advice, don't waste your money as i did.Buy a better reference like:Constructing Intelligent Agents Using Java: Pro. Developer's Guide, 2E;ISBN: 047139601XI have personally perused the Constructing... book in a localbookstore and found it much more worth my time and on point.This better help-"
2,Listen to the majority of the other reviews,"Just in case you didn't believe the other 8 negative reviews posted here, I thought I'd chime in with one more. THIS ROUTINE IS UNNECESSARILY COMPLICATED. I'm no beginner - I've done tons of step workouts and can pick up all kinds of routines, but this one is ridiculous. One quick move after another - hardly any teaching and you don't build on the moves you've learned. The moves are not very natural or intuitive either. It just doesn't end up being effective. Even after you learn the moves (at least 3 or 4 tries), you still end up taking too many unnecessary steps for the overly complex routine. The extra step time would be better spent on some power moves or squats or something that would give me more bang for my buck, so to speak.I bought the DVD of this, which was bundled with the Crunch Fat Blaster. It's a good thing the Fat Blaster was also on this DVD or I'd return it. The Fat Blaster is a MUCH better workout."
5,Gottshall: Making Antique Furniture Reproductions,"This is a great book for those interested in making period furniture reproductions. Gottshall wrote about 5 books on this topic, all of them excellent, must haves. Perhaps his best, my favorite, is Masterpiece Furniture Making, not to be confused with one of his other books, Making Furniture Masterpieces, also very good."
4,Christmas in the Aire Gift Basket,"pleased, loved the vhs (although it did feel a bit 90's but that is when we truly became fans) and cd; have not tried the chocolate. was gotten as a family gift"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Biggles is the too good to be true dashing war hero/sleuth/adventurer/agent written for boys. This book has a bunch of Biggles stories, where he solves bunches of problems, stops rotters, and all that sort of absolute boys own stiff upper lip sort of flying ace thing.One such case does indeed involve a pirate treasure."
1,BROKE WHILE INSTALLING,I bought this thing and literally broke it within seconds! I have used other Mini compact lamp from this SAME brand and they were fine. YES I know how to handle these. The 6 in/10W is much more durable and well built.
5,"Enjoyable, nice plot twists","... Bought it, read a couple of pages and put it down. Came back to it...went along...thought ""I'll never finish this"" when all of a sudden the vortex opened and sucked me into a non-stop read. Completely enjoyable and surprising at the end. Highly recommended. And when it gets slow is when you will be tempted to walk away. DON'T DO IT!! READ ON!! A great E-Ticket ride."
3,Ehh....,"I found this book in the library one afternoon and decided that it looked intriguing. When I started to read it, I realized right away that the ""good guys"" weren't the good guys in reality. THEY STOLE THE MONEY!! Geez. They should have been scared, they should have gone to jail, they should have lost their jobs. C'mon!I figured out a lot of the plot twists before they were revealed and found myself actually rooting for the main characters to get killed (even though it was written in first person...which was strange to begin with...). And then the ""invention"" was bizarre and the concept was just weird.It was a quick read (I think mostly because it was written on a 10th grade reading level). I was anxious for the ending, but then the ending was soooooo long and contrived. I liked it, but wasn't crazy about it. Then I read The Tenth Justice. I'm just glad I didn't read that first, or I would never have read Meltzer's books."
5,Meltzer's Best Yet!,"This is the first Meltzer novel that didn't really jump at me off the shelf. I figured, how exciting can banking be. Boy was I wrong!!! Meltzer, once again, weaves a masterful web and the book gives you a ""behind the scenes"" take of big time banking, money laundering and Disney World. (I can't wait to go there to scope out the secret tunnels). I read the book staight through and was actually upset when I realized I was near the end. Meltzer has really cemented his status as one of the best authors around. GET THIS BOOK!"
1,This.book.is.awful.,"I created the ability to review just to stop others from reading this book. It's truly awful. The characters are annoying, the plot is completely unrealistic, and the ending had me imagining his editor calling and saying ""Okay, it has to get to the printer by 5:00, wrap it up...""Most annoying was the dialogue between the two, often written as ""I.am.telling.you.no."". It's mind-numbing.On top of that, these two jokers are able to overpower two Secret Service agents throughout the book. They hit each other with 2x4's, fists, glass blenders, kicks to the groin, shards of glass, etc, and no one misses a beat. It's like the bad guy in Terminator 2, except the Secret Service is the most well-trained law enforcement agency in the history of the world..."
2,Muddled and Confused,"This was the first of Meltzer's book that I've read, and I'll not likely read another. The Millionaires failed to create any real credibility with the subject matter, feeling hastily or poorly researched. And while the basic premise showed promise, the plot quickly unwound in a series of increasingly unbelievable turns. It was difficult to relate to any of the characters, who lacked any real depth and had few qualities worthy of attention. I found the story convoluted and confusing, perhaps because neither the story nor the characters were sufficient to generate any real interest in trying to figure out who was doing what, and why."
1,You can skim this,"Don't think when reading. That will help get thru this shallow, TV grade plot. Even the Disney World finale doesn't redeem it."
2,Let Down,"I have never read a Brad Meltzer book until now. At first, I was gripped and was pleased to find an author similar to Grisham. The first 100 pages were great, but all of a sudden it became very predicatable and silly. How much pain can people take in a day or two? As much action as there was, I felt bored through most of it and just wanted it to end. On a positive note, some of the dialogue between the brothers was very well written and funny, but overall, I felt let down. I AM willing to try another one of his books and give him the benefit of the doubt, but it has challenged me to become a bestselling author. If this is all it takes to become a famous author, I should have it made in the shade!"
3,"Fun read, nothing earth-shattering","As a financial thriller, this is an okay book, but nothing outstanding. I mostly enjoyed reading it because it moved fairly quickly.The positives: Quick and painless; Different subject; Exploration of the ""gray"" areas of crime (when you think no one can get hurt, does that make it right?).The negatives: Dialogue is a bit too cliche at times; Meltzer still has some work to do to perfect his craft as a writer; Unbelievable plot (but that's okay for a quick and painless read); Flat characterization (the villains) or over characterization (the main characters) a bit annoying at times.Overall, neither bad nor good. Just okay."
3,Hardy Boys meet Nancy Drew once again.,"This is my second Brad Meltzer book and I still don't get it. Just like ""The 10th Justice"", what could have been a good thriller was once again ruined by pubescent dialog among the main characters. Take out the violence and these two books would be on every ninth-grader's summer reading list.How appropriate for the denouement to take place in the magical world of Mickey and Pluto."
2,Not John Grisham,Although this book was entertaining please do not fall for the John Grisham comparisons. It became down right annoying at points. Not enough to keep me hooked on the edge of my seat. As an avid reader this is not one of my favorites and again no where near Grisham !!!!!
4,another,This title is not as deep as the others but keeps to his style. The recurring characters throughout his works keep the interest up. Definately an author to follow for the lighter side.
5,a page-turner that i'll never forget!,i have always been a fan of brad meltzer. the way he is able to create a story that makes me feel like i am actually with the characters during all the events they go through has never ceased to amaze me. this book of his started off a little uninteresting at first then made a complete comeback throughout the rest of the story. also know its off subject but anyone have any ideas for me to start a blog or discussion about?
3,Disappointing,"I discovered Brad Meltzer after buying his first book while away on vacation. I loved it. I waited patiently for his second and third books to be released. I loved them too. Definite page-turners! I was thrilled to see his most recent book at the bookstore and couldn't wait to dive into it. It was disappointing. Meltzer should stick to books about the field of law. He knows it so well that the background information he offers just flows. In ""The Millionaires"" it is as though he is giving information about the world of banking as a teacher would."
1,The Millionaries,Don't look for this on the big screen. Or the little screen. As a matter of fact don't look for this anywhere. Awful.
1,Save Your Money,"&#65279;I wanted to like this book. I really did. I read a lot of books. Perhaps just having read Corrections, it's unfair to judge this book against Franzen's novel, but, I can't help myself. DO NOT waste your time or money on this book's overly simple, poorly developed characters and story line. I guess if you're reading the book out loud to your 9 year old, it probably would be OK; otherwise, don't bother."
4,A good read and hard to put down...,"I bought this because I thought it would be more like the financial novels of Stephen Rhodes, but it is not. However I am very glad that I picked it up since it occupied a rainy weekend very well!It starts off like a book that will be about financial situations, but quickly becomes more of a detective and suspense action drama with only light references to the financial theme.It was creative, well written, had a suspenseful plot, and was entertaining.I enjoyed it immensely. The only problem was that I stayed up until 1 AM. on Saturday night because I wanted to see what happened!"
4,Electronics parts are plentiful on the web,"Music girl stated that the book contains hard to find parts...not sure if she means older outdated parts or simply because radio shack and other electronics stores are no longer serving electronics hobbyists.There are many web resources for electronics parts. Some with small minimum order requirements. Mouser, electronics express, digi-key are three of the ones I use.Please search the net for electronic components. If you are serious about the hobby these larger electronics companies will serve you well.The companies above also have print catalogs they will mail you which is handy for seeing their product lines and they also have very good online ordering sites."
2,See it for James Shigeta,"The story opens in 1935, as an unsophisticated Southern gal (Caroll Baker) meets a suave Japanese diplomat (James Shigeta) at a Washington party. They fall in love and spend the war years in Japan, where he works for peace as she adjusts to a new culture.This movie is based on a wonderful, sensitive memoir and could have been great but, for me, the miscasting of Carroll Baker almost ruins it. She's gauche and unlikable with a shrill, twangy voice and limited acting skills. James Shigeta, on the other hand, is perfect as the handsome and charming diplomat and gives an excellent performance. It's a pleasure to watch him.The movie feels rushed and shallow, never taking the time to explore the couple's feelings in depth. I recommend the book by Gwen Terasaki instead."
3,Dell laptops,"Dell laptop features large screen view capacity, easy lay keyboard, room to upgrade/expansion and an excellent 5 star customer service and tech support. Quality of Dell computer systems have been noted by many companies that supply systems for employees. Whether it's a refurbished system or brand new, you cannot go wrong."
5,"Bluegrass, James Taylor and D.C. go-go all in 1","With a great mix of influences ranging from bluegrass, James Taylor, and D.C. go-go, how can you go wrong??? The first time I even hear these guys was when I at the last moment went to see them live, and I haven't been able to put this cd down. Bright Machine, Atchafalaya, and and eveything else are all songs you can't skip over for the next track."
2,not really songs from the movie,"Quite disappointed when I got my copy.Immediately sat down and played on my piano, only to find out that, most of the songs are the original ABBA songs arrangement, not accordingly to the movie -MAMMA MIA ..Overall, still worth to buy though."
2,Not great for guitar,"Says Piano, Vocal, Guitar. I bought this for guitar. The arrangements are not good for guitar (cant vouch for Piano, as I don't play, I'm sure they're great as it was probably written for Piano with Guitar as an afterthought). Also wanted ""thank you for the music,"" sheet music, but it wasn't included. Not what I was looking for."
3,"Not ""easy""","This is titled ""easy piano."" It would be easy only if you are highly proficient on the piano. It would be better if it were sold as ""for intermediate"" players. If you have been playing for less than 5 years (and that is a dedicated 5 years), then you should not buy this book. If you have been playing off and on for 10 years, you still should not buy this book. I've looked for a true ""easy"" version, but have not found one yet."
3,"Fabulous, but extremely uncomfortable","I fell in love with these upon first seeing them, and they were a good price. I bought them in navy, they are very uncomfortable. If I had gone up a 1/2 size, my feet would have kept slipping out the back. They squeeze the heck out of your toes, but they are so beautiful, I couldn't return them. I even got complements on them from strangers, even though I was hurting inside. I guess beauty does equal pain."
2,"initially too sweat, then loses flavor quickly. Hard to chew","Initially too sweat, then loses flavor quickly. The flavor actually lasts long enough but comapared to the initial ""too sweet"" flavor it gives you the impression it has lost most of it. It is too hard to chew."
3,nice but could be improved,"Being a guy that chews gum everyday i was looking for a healthier alternative to my usual ''dentyne ice'' those small rectangular hard pieces of gum. I found spry and thought i hit the jackpot. When you open the container , first thing you will notice are the gum pieces are much smaller than dentyne ice , then when you first try it the flavor is very nice like a milder version of ''big red'', but thats where it stops, the flavor is sucked out of it in about 20 seconds and you will need to pop about 3 of these just to feel like you are chewing on something. My suggestion is make them about 1/3 bigger and do something to make the flavor last a bit longer. They're supposedly good for your teeth so ill use up my order and possibly order them again if i dont find a better version of this gum."
3,Xlear Spry Cinnamon Gum,"This gum is good, however, the flavor does not last long. This is not a problem as there are 100 pieces BUT, and I warn you, be cautious when consuming more than a few pieces in a day. You could be in for an eventful surprise. The sugar substitutes that end in ""ol"" (like ""Xylitol"") are sugar alcohols and these can pull liquid into the bowel and cause diarrhea and other digestive upsets. Google for more information or try for yourself!"
4,Great And OK For You,"For years, Spry has been my favorite gum. Now I can buy it in bulk. I love cinnamon the most, though you should note that it is strong and good."
3,Nothing to do with the Speed Graphic camera,"I bought this book on prepurchase with the idea that it would largely concern itself with the Speed Graphic camera. I grew up in New York and met Weegee, and other famous users of the old Graphic (and a few of its subjects too: need I drop any names when two initials suffice: MM!) and always wanted to use one, but by the time i was old enough to buy a real camera the Nikon F had replaced the Graphics completely.It's a book on fifties era Minneapolis, ""as seen through"" the Speed Graphic, not on the camera itself. I have no beef with Minneapolis, but unless you live there, who else would care?I donated it to the library here in New Jersey. The photos are excellent, if you want to know what happened in Minneapolis. Maybe someone does."
5,Larry Millet is a gold mine!,"Larry Millett has put together so many amazing books on the history of the Minneapolis and Saint Paul. Strange Days, Dangerous Nights is my favorite. If you like photography, history, journalism or any combination of the three, this book is for you. Amazing photos with beautifully written descriptions bring you back in time to the 1940's-1960's."
2,The book that never stops..,This book is poorly written and has very little historical value. Clearly the author failed to take out his biases for the scope of his argument. I also found it to drone on endlessly.
1,waste of time and money,"he starts off funny tellinh jokes and then turns into some fanatic philosipher and the rest of the show is him trying to convince people his veiws are right, should have stuck with the jokes, i hate i wasted my money on this"
5,Worked perfectly,I love this DVD. I've seen his standup and definitely recommend this DVD to friends :) :) :) :) :)
2,pretty terrible.,"these are not that great.nylon ""sheath"" is not manufactured to very tight tolerances, mount points on back are pretty much useless.the needles themselves are not very well balanced.they do not keep an edge either, being cheap chinese steel.already dull,and looking really worse for wear. not really worth the money."
3,The 1965 edition is better ...,"Many kids (including me) who grew up before the microwave learned to cook with this book.I guess it's only natural to prefer what you grew up with, but I really prefer the 1965 edition. It's larger with more recipes, and it had the advantage of a second round of kid-testing.Great gift for a child old enough to treat it gently (and, obviously, old enough to be safe with stove, sharp knives, etc.)"
3,Pretty,This is a pretty vase and the size is very nice. I agree that it is not as purple as the photo shows. It has more of a rosy iridescent color. I would prefer it if it were purple but it is still attractive.
2,Disappointed,I was disappointed with this item because it was very small. I guess I should have paid closer attention to the dimensions.
4,delicate and pretty vase,"This vase is very pretty, petite, delicate but not as purple as the picture appears. The color is closer to a rosy color. But it is beautiful."
1,No Tech Support,I bought a Compaq Presario 1200. A few months after I had it the battery circuit and the motherboard crashed. I was told by Compaq that the warrenty would not cover the repairs. Now I am stuck with a laptop that is not worth spending the money to fix. I would encourage anyone considering purchasing this product to think twice. It's definitly not worth the cost.
1,Skip this book.,"This book really has nothing to do with what Santeria is really about. Mostly it is English translations of spells written in Spanish booklets available in Botanicas. If you want to learn about Santeria, skip this book."
5,Fascinating Book for the Open Minded,"This book, by the controversial British biologist Rupert Sheldrake, is stimulating and fascinating. The first part of the book goes over anecdotal and more rigorous scientific evidence of psi, which sets the stage for more detailed discussion about the sense of being stared at. Sheldrake goes over accounts and studies of animal/human interaction, human/human interaction, and concludes that there is a kind of knowing beyond the traditional five senses. The sense of being stared at is fairly common, and Sheldrake posits a biological/evolutionary explanation for how it works, and why we have it.I found the book to be very interesting reading, especially the accounts of animal/human interactions, citing cases involving dogs, cats, parrots, and horses.Well worth the price."
1,"Wack, except for Haylie's cameo","This DVD is kinda wack because the episodes are lame and pathetic, I guess the Erik Estrada one is funny in a way, but still wack. I should give it 0 stars, but I give it one star because of Haylie Duff's cameo in ""Xtreme Xmas"" she has like a couple lines in it. Haylie rules!"
3,Not nearly as good as I expected,I bought this thinking it would be as good as nupercanal or better. It's not nearly as good as nupercanal. Won't buy it again.
3,Jury still out on this one,"I am going to purchase this item one more time as I am almost done with the first bottle. I figure it may take a bit longer to get into the system to really see benefits, as I do not see a difference in my hair nor my nails as yet. It is not bad when mixed in apple juice. I use about 10 drops a day. I will wait until I use another bottle before I decide whether to recommend to a friend or not."
3,not sure,Did not seem to do anything for my nails. I am still giving it to my son for his enamel. I'm not sure if it is having an effect.
1,How does this work,OK lets review. There is one ounce of product. It costs $14.79. How can it cost $0.92 per ounce. Should we be suspect of Amazon or 911 Health Shop? Pretty disappointing.
2,It has little flowers!,"Yikes, the purple bag has 4 little flowers attached to each corner; looks like a little dollie pillow or something. Not what we expected!!"
5,Good quality,"I have used Senco fasteners for some time. I had previously been purchasing them at a big-box building supply. These are the exact same products found in the store. Amazon had them for a better price. I was doing a shed with board/batten surface, and the battens were pressure treated 3/8"" stock, so these staples fit the project ideally. They work perfectly in my Campbell Hausfield Stapler/Nailer. Like other reviewers mentioned, they were packed rather loosely inside a large box, and the package of staples had almost opened before it arrived to me."
4,A very young talent in progress!,"Yundi Li really promises to become one of the most prominent colorists of this new century. Its sound is not precisely expressive but suggestive. In this sense he would be regarded a player whose style possesses something of the incorporeal vitality of Gieseking, the introspection of Radu Lupu and the phrasing of Guiomar Novaes. His next recordings on Debussy and Ravel must be first order performances.Personally I think his Mozart must be polished and matured (because Mozart is not Haydn), his Scarlatti is plenty of admirable sharpness and wondrous vitality; his Schumann is hovered by that enigmatic atmosphere that embosses and enriches the Romantic mood of this well known Op. And his Liszt possesses that flaming elegance with abrupt concessions of virtuous splendor. Somehow he reminds me to the young Brendel in the late fiftiesThe Italians have a fortunate expression: Augury. So, don't forget him, because he will be one of the masters in the next years to come. ."
2,Symbolism over substance,"The jist of this book is simple; write down on pre-printed forms what it is that is bugging you from anger to a lost relationship to whatever and then burn, bury, or flush the paper and abbra cadabra that little problem is gone! WRONG! There are no techniques for solving these problems other than making a list of them. The last third of the book is nothing but these pre-printed forms you can write on and then destroy. There are many really good books out there that give solid solutions to whatever is bugging you but this is not one of them.I only gave it a star because it is full of good quotations.Save your money on this one!"
5,"If you can find it, get it!","This first, independently released album from the Virginia Coalition may not be as slick as their later releases, but it remains my favorite--somewhat more eclectic and interesting, to my mind, than the later albums (though I'm quite fond of them, as well). Both the melodies and lyrics appeal to me. ""The End of the Road"" remains my favorite track, one I nearly always feel the urge to repeat. ""Spare Change"" is probably the catchiest tune on here--the one that persuaded me to buy the album after hearing the band live in 1999. This is one of the few albums that I can listen to all the way through, without wanting to skip over any tracks. If you can get your hands on this album, do so!"
2,Not for heavy babies,I bought this carrier before my son was born and it worked great for almost two months. I liked that he could face forward but... he put on weight very fast and wearing the baby bjorn was simply unbearable! I then bought the Ergo carrier and my son and I are comfortable and happy and we can continue to comfortably use it until he is 50 lbs (not that I will...lol.) I would not recommend buying this somehow very popular product because there is no telling how long you will be able to use it and it is very hard on the lower back.
2,Uncomfortable and Uneasy,"I only used this once or twice. I found it hard to manipulate. I never felt safe with it, and it never felt secure. My baby cried the whole time she was in it."
3,Good for a little while only,"We got the baby Bjorn as a shower gift, and were able to use it for only a short while. It worked well from about 1 month to 4 months, but after that the my daughters weight was not distributed well, and gave me terrible backaches after only a about an hour of using it. We recently purchased an Ergo baby carrier and are much happier."
4,Two babies later - still going strong,"We really enjoy the baby Bjorn carrier and have had this classic style since 2008. We recently brought it back out for our four month old and often use it in lieu of a double-stroller when we're on the go. I have used it to take both of my children to the grocery store. I find that less people try and touch your child when you're holding them close in a baby carrier! plus it allows me to place my toddler in the seat and go shopping without waiting on someone else to come home.Our only complaint with this carrier is that as the child grows the pressure on your neck and shoulders can really take a toll, which is why we will probably put this away by the time she's 20 pounds. It is really just too uncomfortable to carry them for long periods of time once they pass that weight mark. I would still consider it a good buy though."
3,great until about 14ish pounds!,"This carrier is truly a life saver! It is easy to use, comfortable, quite handy. Until your child hits about 14 pounds!! I have tried adjusting the straps a number of ways, it just doesn't fit comfortably anymore. For me, it causes mild shoulder pain and difficulty breathing. It makes me feel like I'm pregnant again!! However, I must say that until about a month ago, this product was so handy, and an absolute necessity. My baby just outgrew it quicker than I expected she would."
5,Love these carriers,"These carries are comfortable to the wearer and the little one they are holding (my 6 month old told me plain as could be that he loved sitting in it--obviously not, but he sure seemed happy when strapped in it on several occassions). Works well to free up your adult hands for doing whatever you need to. It is well built, and will not leave you with any concern about your child not being safely held and supported."
5,Love it!,"This baby carrier is wonderful! It is super comfortable. We use it for long walks, hanging out at family events, etc. We take it with us everywhere and due to its size we can fit it in our diaper bag when not in use. Baby also falls asleep comfortably when out during naps and cant be put down in a crib. Baby also loves facing forward and will stay put without fussing for hours at a time. I am so glad I purchased this carrier."
4,Good for younger babies,"This carrier is great for very young babies. The good things about it are it's really easy to get on and off, it's really easy to put a sleeping baby down since the whole front comes off. Also, I my baby felt very secure in it...there was no way she would go anywhere.The negative is that it really hurts your back and shoulders after you wear it for awhile, even with a young baby. Also, once my baby got older than about 5 months, she got really heavy in this carrier. Now I use an Ergo and love it.I have heard that different carriers are better for hip development than the Baby Bjorn...carriers that the infant sits in, rather than having their legs hang down.It sure was great for that 5 months though!"
3,Good Product,"Overall great product, could use a little more back support...my daughter only weighs 14lbs and it hurts my shoulders and back after about 15 minutes."
5,Cannot rate this highly enough,"Like the title says, I honestly cannot rate this product highly enough. I know that the BabyBjorn is more expensive than most carriers but I would gladly pay double for it. My son loves to be held and carried and will not sleep for very long if I put him down. Luckily, he has taken to the BabyBjorn so I can carry him around, he gets sleep and I get work done. Plus it distributes the weight evenly so when I use it my back doesn't hurt as much as it does when I just carry him. At first the instructions to use it seemed daunting, but it only takes a couple of times putting it on for it all to make sense. There are a few things that have been worth their weight in gold since my baby came and this is definitely one of them!"
2,"If you are into back pain, this is your baby carrier","Sure, baby will fit nicely into this carrier and you will have your 2 hands back.. but at what cost? Back pain, strain, and feet pain.Our baby fit into this until 20lbs.... up to 10lbs it was fine. He felt light as a feather. But over time, as he grew heavier and heavier, it was more difficult to wear without feeling the pain.The max is 22lbs anyway, so we had about 3.5 months useful life for this carrier.It was the very first baby carrier on the market, but by no means the best. Which is why so many used bjorns are on auction sites these days.For a carrier with better ergonomics and longer useful life, try the Ergo or Beco carrier.... worth the investment."
5,I can get more stuff done!,"I have other baby carriers and not one can compare to this one. It's easy to use. I do not have to have any help to put on or put baby into, Baby is very cozy in this. My baby usually falls asleep within minutes. I like this product also because I can get stuff done...while toting him around! And the best part.... i can open it up and lay him down, without waking him!!! Super easy and a comfort for mom to wear too! Would hghly recommend"
4,"great, but expensive","This carrier is very easy to use without additional adult help. The straps are soft, easy to adjust and it's simple to clean (lots of slobber from my son chewing on the flap when forward facing). My lower back begins to hurt after about an hour with this on but I can't imagine any front carrier is going to feel all that good after that long. I am not rating this a 5 simply because it's expensive. I would recommend trying on a few more inexpensive brands if price is an issue."
4,Easy to Use and Compact,"Our Son likes being in the Bjorn, especially facing in (he even get sleep for hours in it). This carrier is easy to put on and take off and quite condensed. He is still two months so I am not sure if it will be this comfortable as right now if he is already over 15 lbs.What I like having it is that I can go for walks and get errands finished around the house. I tried it at the store and at the mall, but after a while my back started hurting. My son was actually pretty happy in it. My husband wore it a few times to and he said it was comfortable."
1,"Lame,There are Better Options Out There","This carrier is overpriced and uncomfortable. If you are thinking of buying this carrier, you should upgrade to a soft structured carrier. The ergo is a viable option or even better is the Angel Pack Baby Carrier. It is made with organic cotton and designer fabrics. I own 2 and they are great."
1,Scratched my baby's leg!!!!,This stupid carrier scratched my baby girl's leg TWICE!!! yes she was the correct weight to be in it but she never liked it. She seemed very uncomfortable and stiff in it and thick stiff material scratched her leg up TWICE. im so upset. Returning this item immediately.
3,"Good product, suitable for infants upto 3-4 months","We bought this product after reading reviews for our 6 month old daughter. She liked it since she is so attached to us. After putting her for few hours, we saw that the product was too tight on her thighs and she got rashes. I believe this product is much more suitable for kids up to 4-5 months only. Again that's my perception...."
3,okay carrier but hurts my back,I received this carrier as a gift from my mom at my shower and was excited because i had heard all the great things about them and had seen them everywhere. It worked great at first and my son is now 6 months old and 22 pounds. It kills my back and i have never had back problems before. I can't wear it for longer than 20 minutes. I just don't think it's worth the money.I would highly recommend the ERGO baby carrier which is great and in the same price range. I wish i would have known about it before! I have no back pain whatsoever with it! It's awesome!
3,Convenient,"Very convenient, especially for a quick walks. Enjoy! I HIGHLY recommend this product! Wish the color (black) was deeper. I'm afraid that if i do wash it the color will fade."
2,Please get off the El-P pee pee,"Are you serious? 4 1/2 stars? are you people related to El-P? One thing i must say about El-P fans is that they're loyal. so loyal they lie to themselves. This self-serving, ego-driven, ""I'm better than you"", ""I can be the only white boy rapper so I blackball any other MC not down with my crew"",,,blah blah blah album is not as good as it should be. Sounds more like some fat kid found himself a Psychology textbook and a thesaurus... you know, i was a big fan of the FUN CRUSHER plus until I grew up and moved out of moms house into a place of my own...."
2,way too overated,"el-p is no doubt a talented producer and a very good business man. however, this cd is not a very good reflection of that. the beats (all produced by el-p himself) can only be described as noise. sure they fit the lyrics to a tee, but just about anyone producing for themselves can acheive that. despite what many others may imply, there is no profound content here. the lyrics are nothing special, nor is el-p's flow. if you want a quality def jux album, look elsewhere. if you want better el-p beats, look elsewhere. maybe Mr. Lif's ""I Phantom"" would be a better starting point."
2,Sounds like metal garbage cans falling down my basement steps,"I'm not a real big fan of Def Jux, I bought this album based on good reviews and so far I like almost any kind of alternative/creative hip hop ex.(Blackalicious,kool keith,busdriver,deltron,mf doom ect.) Some people cream there pants over this just cause its different,and I know some of you are thinking ""your ears just arn't mature enough to appreciate it"" listen kids I know good hip hop when I hear it and this is just amature lyrics with wack beats. Mabey if I was still taking acid and mushrooms I could appreciate it better, but iv'e been out of high school for 7 years."
4,ben,i don't know why this is not rated higher. It is a good counter and does its job as its supposed to. My only complain is that my hands smell like metal after using it for a while (30 mins +)
2,Breaks easily,"Mine was larger than expected, but broke after less than 30 days of very very light usage.Otherwise - it was simple, did what I needed it to do."
1,Poor Condition,Not a bad read but book was in terrible shape. Pages were ripped and there was writting all over the book! I would never sell an item in this condition nor would I give it to my son to bring to his class for a book exchange. Seller should be ashamed!
3,Joke,"This book was not what I thought it would be. My sons read through some, but became bored quickly. This book is a great idea on how to write jokes, but I wish it was written differently to where its more enjoyable. Maybe as my sons' get older they will enjoy it."
4,great in the kayak,The product the Kwik Tek Dry Pak was what I need the week before I purchased it when I dropped my new Iphone into Lake Berryessa It was in a plastic seal type lunch bag. I decided that I would not loose another electronic device that way. The case did work great after dumping my kayak again and it saved my new cell phone it is a very good purchase if you are near the water or snow. I like it better that the hard plastic cases because it is easier to pack and carry in a pocket. Maybe someday when I stop tipping over I might not need one. I doubt that will ever happen
1,Not for the Sony Ericsson S710a,"Despite the description on Amazon, neither this product's package, nor the software seem to support the S710a mobile phone. An attempt to install the software, just on the offchance that it might work, resulted in an endless, reboot/install loop."
4,Works if you use it properly,"This product works great if you actually follow the installation instruction and do not use the USB cable in a USB hub.The cable communicates with your phone very slowly through a USB hub, you have to use it with a USB port connected directly into your computer.If you don't follow the software install instructions properly, it will not work at all.You can't call Sony's or Sony Ericsson's tech support for a product they didn't make! You have to contact Mobile Action-since it's their product.This review may only legally be shown directly on Amazon.com"
1,poor construction and packaging.,I ordered two safes. They arrived in damaged boxes. The safes inside were severely dented/scratched. One of the metal support legs broke off. The door to the safe comes off the hinge if you flip the safe upside-down. I was able to return both safes through amazon with no hastle.
4,Works Well For Being Used,"It works pretty well for being used, but for some reason the timer keeps running late. But other than that it seems to be in good shape and I've had no other problems with it."
2,Poor quality control; timer feature was useless.,"the product has decent layout and features that would make it a very compelling option for many aquarium/terrariumm keepers looking to automate lighting, CO2 and other functions. Plus the fact that contains 4 ""always on"" plugs could make it the only power strip many would need for the set-up. However, the quality control is poor... I set the timer function in the evening and it looked good at first... but then the next morning the clock was already one hour late! I insisted for a little longer but then after a couple of days the clock was so out-of-whack (5 to 7 hours behind) I gave up and returned.From what I've read the quality and durability of the timer function in power strips is unreliable for many models from many makers. I've just ordered a similar product from GE (product has mixed reviews - and comes from an American icon!) and I will post it what I find."
3,works well but very noisy,"After using this timer for a few months it became very noisy in an irritating way, so I'm replacing it. Otherwise, it works well."
3,Doesn't last,"I have had this product for about two years and about three months ago the dial timer stop working. Until this point, it operated fine without problems."
1,"Garbage, Don't Buy!!","For a product whose sole purpose is to automatically time aquarium electronics, this item fails miserably. It lasted about 2 weeks before I noticed it losing time, between 5-10 minutes a day which got progressively worse. Finally it would randomly get stuck and not trip at the designated time period. WeakI used for day/night cycle on a 55 gal freshwater tank. The power strip was mounted underneath the cabinet, completely unexposed to anything that might cause it to malfunction. It looks as clean as the day i bought it. I even tried adjusting the trip tabs to no avail, just in case one of them was causing the problem. Nope.I had initially disregarded the negative reviews on this one, chalking it up to a bad batch, but maybe there's a bigger defect going on here. I'm just lucky that I didn't use it for anything vital. If you give a crap about your tank critters, for the love of god, pass on this one."
1,Avoid! This timer is likely to fail.,"Poor construction and/or quality control will cause this timer to fail, most likely sooner rather than later. I have been through several of these and similar units and in all of them the timer mechanisms have failed. Several were defective and did not keep proper time right out of the box. Others began losing hours every day after a few months. The one that lasted the longest worked for about a year before it failed.Look for another product."
2,Disappointing,"Too many numbers without enough explanation. Shandler seems to assume that you have been reading his books for years and have a thorough understanding of all of his metrics.However, I do believe that the approach is sound. Including more commentary on players would be useful.The primary advantage to this book is that it has one of the earliest release dates for books that discusses the coming season. Without much competition, what else are you going to read in the cold of winter?I doubt if I will buy it again next year."
3,you get what you pay for,How else can you find egg protein powder at this price for free shipping. How good it tastes depends on how hungry you feel and how much you think you're saving. Good for weight loss because you probably cannot down enough to gain weight. You may want to add sweetener. Not BAD for you. Doesn't mix extremely well. Overall reasonable product.
1,the ruined this powder with stevia,"this is no longer unsweetened, it has stevia and contains 4 grams of carbs per serving so its incorrectly labled as 0 carbs on in the items description.i dont know why they changed it, it used to be great the way it was, im sorry i ordered it."
2,like drinking sand with water,"This product doesn't dissolve well at all, it scratches my throat when I swallow! The taste is rather unremarcable. I bought it because my favorite Universal Egg Pro Ultra seems to be discontinued... :(The only reason I give it two stars is because it doesn't contain artificial sweeteners."
4,VABSB 2,"The first and as yet only time I saw this film was on VHS with no subtitles back in 2002. It was so bizarre and brilliant in a disjointed, insane and stylized way that I had been searching for it ever since. It's essentially about a trio of dysfunctional(in all ways) young people who get themselves tangled in manslaughter, blackmail, gun violence, suicide, murder, and karaoke. Oh and the main character is a bisexual transgender man/woman. I didn't know that watching the film without subtitles though, which I suppose is a triumph for her (formerly his) surgeon. Before finding the actual title of this film I could only sum it up as ""The Violent Adventures of Bisexual Snapple Bitch 2"" which pretty much describes the arch of the film."
4,Lives up to the title,This book provides a very useful coverage of the subject material. It is a great book if you are looking to understand the trickiest (but most useful) things about C: advanced pointer manipulation and memory managment.
1,Poorly written book,"After reading the reviews, I purchased this book only to be severely disappointed. This book does a poor job explaining casting, pointer to pointers and scaling. The author included a lot of code in the text (and on disk), but very few comments within the code or text. In source 5.6, he has a 1 sentence explanations for 6 pages of code. I read the first 100 pages and that's all I can take. This book stinks!"
4,"Keeps reds, RED!",I recently dyed my hair red and saw this product at Walmart on clearance for $3 so i thought i would try it out. Basically what is does is add slight red pigment to your hair to keep it looking fresh. It is easy to apply when shampooing your hair and will color your hands red but is easily washed out with soap and water. It definitely does help keep your hair red and is a great for red dye since its the quickest to fade but as for the price of $7 for a small tube it's really not worth buying. You are better off just paying $7 to re-dye your hair.
2,"Lid not the ""top""","I purchased this Steamer as gift that I have yet to give, so I'm not exactly sure about how well it works. I love that it has a faucet to pour out the broth--thereby offering the ability to make two different items at once. That's so efficient! I love the volume it holds at 19 quarts--and it's so festive with the lobster printed on it--although it looks just a bit better in the pictures. My problem with what arrived was the lid. The lid was dented in two places--even though both the outer and inner boxes were not banged up. The lid felt very flimsy and not sturdy at all (actually very different from the pot itself)."
4,Watch out N'Sync and BSB!,Why haven't I ever heard of these guys! Can we say talented? Yeah they are!Buy it! (My fave song is FREAKY!)
3,Cheap but it works,"I bought this 9 months ago and used it on two Maxtor hard drives. It works great out of the box. I have two things to gripe about:- The AC adapter is big and clunky.- Since there's no active cooling, I fried a hard drive during the hot summer months. I usually turn the unit off after each use, but I occasionally forget. When I did forget, the drive failed.Just some things to watch out for."
1,Didn't work; junk,"Tried it with two different disk drives. Doesn't work -- actually, doesn't appear to power on (disk doesn't spin up). I really don't appreciate being used as the manufacturer's quality control department. Avoid this one!"
5,Making Watercolors,"Harrison defines and employs standard language used in identifying watercolor effects. She also identifies watercolor usages and materials and is consistent in this regard. Her illustrative material is literally a survey of the watercolor world, with no histrionics, from abstraction to the tightest realism. It is a beautiful book and gratifyingly complete. She has no 'method' to push. With her insistence on planning as the key to realizing one's concept, she leaves the reader in peace to enjoy the experience the book offers of seeing how accomplished watercolorists plan their work.The index is excellent. I will admit disappointment that Harrison touches only lightly on the qualities of now very expensive materials that would enable one to make useful choices. Her remarks on paper by type and maker I find useful and I wish this knowledgeable woman had given the reader more insights on other materials."
3,A good resource book,"I think the material in this book is good, but widely available in other resources. I think it is a good book to have in my library, but I probably won't refer to it often."
1,Almost half of this book is a reprint of a previous edition.,Some years ago I purchased the previous edition of this book and found it very useful. When I saw what appeared like a new edition of this book I decided to purchase it. On the cover it is marked REVISED AND UPDATED. The techniques are described well and most are new material but Part 2 - Themes is exactly the same as the first edition and this was very disappointing and will make me think carefully about purchasing a book unless I can view it in a bookshop.
4,Politically Correct Dolph,"I respect this movie because it deals with the problem of landmines in Africa. Whether or not you like Dolph or his acting, this movie is relevant and politically correct. It starts out pretty slow but ends with lots of action and has a couple of surprises in it. Dolph and his costar (Clarie Stansfield) look really good. The problems with the film are that Dolph's voice sounds like he had larangitus during the filming and the landmine they are in search of is supposed to be very sophisticated technology but is really kind of pathetic. On the other hand, in real life, by the time you get as close to a landmine as Dolph's character does in this movie, you are already dead or have at least lost a limb."
1,Boy Black Metal Is So Origianl,"Garbage Pure Garbage,Buy one Satan Rocks And You Bought Them All.Come On Kids Isn't It Time To Grow Up A Little"
4,Really comfortable,"The crutches are really comfy but the only disadvantage is that it has a distinct plastic smell that may annoy you for a little while. And your hand gets that smell too when you hold the handle for a while. Getting that smell off your hands is a little hard. But that smell soon goes away in a week or so. Else, it's the best crutches I have ever used."
