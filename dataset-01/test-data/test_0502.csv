5,Praise for Capcom^_^,Street Fighter Ex plus alpha is an exceptional game with complex polygon graphics and fun interactive gameplay^_^ This game lives up to its name and then some with it's unique menus and hidden characters^_~ I highly recommend this game to all Capcom fans^_^
3,An interesting account by a B Grade actor,"An interesting book not because of his life, but because of the other famous people he writes about. Obviously written with a sequel in mind, but no sequel can I find."
1,Zeroed Out,"Unfortunately this CD lacks originality and quite frankly was not worth the money. If they tried to do something different they might sound better, but dont waste your money."
3,interesting but no chemistry,"the best thing about this story is the peek into the tv business. I don't doubt the author has faced some of the complex politics and back-stabbing in her career as a sitcom writer. The romance, however, reads like a dull sitcom. corny jokes you can't help but laugh at, flawed characters you can't help but like. but i found myself not really caring whether the leads got together or not. more interested in whether they got to write for a good show. maybe i was looking for a bit more fantasy."
4,Parent's 'Texas' is bigger than life!,"An impressive pictorial tome--for sure. ""Texas"" by Laurence Parent is an impressive pictograph of the Lone Star State. Parent is an acclaimed and accomplished photographer whose lenses have found some rather enchanting shots. With an impressive--and dramatic--essay by Elmer Kelton, the book is more than just ""coffee table"" subject matter. This volume shows National Geographic and Architectural Digest quality reproduction of its photos. A real treat. Thematically, however, Parent doesn't seem to have a real pattern for his photos, rather they appear as they strike his fancy. But no matter. Each picture is worth far more than a thousand words! (Billyjhobbs@tyler.net)"
3,Great product when properly calibrated,"Well, I'm semi-happy with my purchase. I bought two of these items because they were cheap compared with the shipping cost. Luckly, one of them registers the ""correct"" temperature with the other being something like 3~5 deg too low (depending on ambient temperature checked by a high-end digital thermometer).The product works perfectly and offers excellent visibility and is a snap to install.I'm just not happy with the product variability. No point in having a thermometer that's not particularly accurate!"
3,Art of Preserving-Is it safe?,"The recipes are well balanced and interesting. My problem with this book is the method of sealing. Jars are often sealed after the ingredients have cooled, so no true seal occurs. Covers such as parchment and cellophane are used. I would certainly want to use USDA approved sealing methods with these recipes. This includes sealing the jars with rubber rings or Ball/Kerr type jar covers and screw lids and processing the jars in a hot water bath from 10-30 minutes depending on the recipe ingredients. (Check web site canning sites maintained by university home economists) I would not feed these recipes to my family without using standard (USDA) food safety precautions for preserving."
3,Scrappy collection of unpublished writings,A somewhat scrappy collection of unpublished writings of Daphne du Maurier including her original plot outline for her most famous novel. One gets the impression it was put together to capitalise on her fans insatiable desire for more writing from a very successful but reclusive author.
4,Bringing the medieval middle class and poor to life,"These are genuinely endearing stories of individuals of medieval Europe who were not royalty or aristocracy. Power gleans details of the lives of these people from numerous sources, and, at least in the case of the peasant, Bodo, uses these sources to create a composite character, due to the lack of sufficient historical information about one individual.Powers describes the lives, homes, general living conditions and practices, the towns and villages, and the working and leasure time of her subjects. With varying degrees of success, Powers is able to bring three-dimensional figures to life, and at the end of this work, one feels like one is leaving new friends.Highly recommended to anyone who enjoys cultural history or simply wants a better idea of medieval life."
4,Slide Copier For Kodak EasyShare,I'm pleased with my purchase. I converted my old slides into digital pictures that my family has not seen in many years. The pictures are clear and the conversion was easy. I'm sure a scanner can do more slides at one time but at half the cost it's the wasy to go even with doing one slide at a time. I'm happy with my purchase. If you don't want to spend to much and wnat to convert your old slides into digital pictures I recommend purchasing this adapter for your camera....it's easy to use.
2,"Probably going overboard with the crunchy, but....","I didn't like this book because of two illustrations.. 1. The very young baby is holding a bottle (I would prefer to see him nursing), and 2. He is being fed strawberries. (Babies that young are not supposed to have strawberries due to allergies.) Sure, your toddler doesn't know that, but chances are some adults don't bother with research and this just reinforces the wrong behavior."
1,deceptive listing,"I bought this item to fill out an order. The listing showed three pads. If it had listed one pad I would not have bought this item. I have searched for somewhere to complain about this listing but Amazon only lets you leave feedback for other sellers, not for items sold by AMAZON. DO NOT BUY THIS unless you only want one random lily pad."
2,misleading ad,The ad is very misleading. I thought I was getting 3. grrrrrrr.. I hope people stop buying them so it will encourage more honest advertising. shame on them. I am sure they know what they are doing.
3,"Some misplaced emphasis, but still exciting","In my review of the first book of the Alexander trilogy by Valerio Massimo ManfrediI said that all 3 books are a great read. That said, as often happens, this middle book may in some sense be the weakest. I think there is too much misplaced emphasis on General Memnon. Most historical accounts do not accord him as much importance. Nevertheless, readers will enjoy all 3 books as an integral unit. This version of the story deserves greater recognition among English-speaking readers."
4,AZO,"This product enables me to check my urine, discreetly at home for any signs of infection. A good way to cut down needs to make an appointment with a doctor."
5,"""Miller never lets you down""","Susan Miller's memoir NEVER LET ME DOWN is a poignant, deeply felt emotional journey told in clear, forceful, sometimes vividly poetic language. The book has something disturbing but ultimately comforting to say to anyone who didn't grow up in a ""perfect family""; in other words, Miller's book will enrich the lives of all readers."
3,Bug urferd whomsagtureicher? Dassi Vien,"Semvloighe treissta The Picketts ""Paper Doll"" vlaivo de huiner ghouja un diufghy exploutivant o fiuy vien. Uferdeerfe o ryuta yuib ""best made"" thi de fligrinugre ""basement"" o djioja.Enjoy it!!"
2,sorry album,"Judging by the artists contributing on this album I expected it to be a little more creative. It is bland, boring, and way to ""dancy"" than I imagined. If it wouldn't have been for the first two tracks the album would have only gotten one star."
1,This is not a real instrument,"Contrary to other reviews here, this is not a real instrument. It is not possible to accurately tune this guitar. If you purchase, realize it is a toy, not a musical instrument. I bought this for my youngest son to play with his older brother and sister, but am returning. Because it can't be tuned properly, he can't play with his sister and brother, so it is useless for our purposes. Quite disappointed."
3,hunter,"Good knife. Second one I have owned. Lost the first last hunting season. I didn't know it came with a sheath and amazon recommended that I purchase a sheath. So I did and now have 1 knife and 2 sheath, and both are exactly the same."
5,An Extraordinary Performance,"This DVD concert only reinforces my belief that Kylie Minogue is the world's greatest female pop entertainer. As good as her studio recordings are, listening to them is nothing compared to seeing her perform. Kylie's stage presence is utterly amazing. Her music is fun, spirited, and will make you want to get up and dance. Even the song ""Can't Get You Out of My Head,"" that was so overplayed on top 40 radio, sounds fresh and new on this DVD. And even if you don't like all the music, just watching Kylie strut across the stage in those red, high heeled manolos is a treat in itself. My only complaint is that the music isn't more representative of her career as a whole. It focuses on her newer material. But if you have her Sydney, Australia and Manchester, England concert DVDs, this will complement them nicely."
4,Bought for High School Student,"My niece was studying Homer in 9th grade and I thought Professor Grant's insights might be helpful. Also a good introduction to basic mythology: Cupid and Psyche, Pyramus and Thisbe...the list goes on and on."
4,once in a lifetime,"i know that's a song by the Talking Heads but it is how i feel about Bryan Ferry's 1985 masterwork ""Boys and Girls."" I know there are reviews which say it got lost in the hectic year 1985 but its release was announced on Entertainment Tonight. As for the content, Ferry complains without deadlines for release, he wouldn't put out as many records so glad he did, as its haunting refrains and melodious instrumentation makes Boys and Girls a real keeper. ""Slave to Love"" is maybe the love song people thought the Police's ""Every Breath you Take"" should have been and ""Boys and Girls"" left no doubt where the former Roxy Music front man's interests lay. From the cover art to the liner notes, it was perhaps the classic Bryan Ferry album and now, 25 years later, he will perhaps put out another with his upcoming Sept 2010 release. I definitely hope so and i hope he tours, where his lyrical brilliance really shines."
4,Cheer Up Mr Ferry,"The album is somewhat similar to Avalon but it remains a rather melancholy affair. The songs are often romantic but very distant, and not very warm at all. Ferry is so awesome, he should cheer up, throw away his keyboards, and go make a great rocker. Or something else than this stuff."
3,"not a bad book, but limited in scope","If you're hoping for a detailled breakdown for accomplishing finished renderings, there are much better books on the market. The author recommends some good starting markers and sets some color recipes down, but he rarely works 'tight', so if you're looking for a step by step process leading to a tight comp (as most aspiring commercial artists) shop elsewhere. Even in the better rendering books (arch. rendering books), they rarely address problems of flesh tones and getting edgelights, so I give this book 3 stars just for being in color and trying to cover the material he did. I just wish he took some more time with his 'examples'. He's so loose, he's bad."
1,English - Tagalog Dictionary (Languages of the World),Why is this book listed for $350.00?Is this some kind of consumer trap? Amazon needs to investigate and ensure book prices listed are valid.
4,Good for the price,"Not really top notch quality, but really good for the low cost. Considering one pair German pliers or Xuron could cost more than this whole set. I also use them for model building purposes."
1,Useless,"Used this case for a while on my Toshiba Gigabeat, but don't use it anymore. Badly designed. Didn't work for me. You're much better off without a case..this was a waste of my money."
4,"Decent cord, does what it needs to","I use this to connect laptops to my 19"" 2nd monitor through a KVM. Nothing fancy. The cord was good quality, not too thin like some projector cords, but not insanely gurthy. Connectors are easy to use, and its black - so it hides itself well. Signal quality is probably a factor at 10ft, but due to my setup there is nothing I could blame solely on this cord - it works perfect for me."
4,My New Favorite,"I've heard her songs before that were sampled on compilation CDs. But, I was not aware of the artist. I really like her voice, as well as, the soulful Brazilian rhythms featured on this album. My favorite is ""Dona Musica""."
4,Wonderful Read - Connection to Borderlands a Coincidence???,"An excellent story, set in the Return of Faerie genre. Immediately upon finishing The Last Hot Time by John M. Ford I rushed to my bookshelf and grabbed my worn copies of the Borderlands series, suspecting to find more than just a similarity of theme and topic. After a few minutes, there it was. Rico and Linn, characters in The Last Hot Time, also make appearences in the Borderland series. Coincidence?? Has John M. Ford ever been seen in the same room as Will Shetterly?? No matter. Fan of the Borderland series or not, this gritty coming of age tale, where no one is what they seem is an enjoyable read. The only thing I found lacking was a listing of future titles by the same author. Give me more!!"
1,"Don't Waste Your Time, Instead Read Weigel's Superior Book","Before reading this book, be aware of the agenda of the authors. Also, be aware that the accusations carelessly repeated in the book (and book description and review) have been thoroughly investigated and proven false.Rather than reading a destructive book full of false accusations, read a sober, constructive book on the same subject by a faithful Catholic scholar. George Weigel's ""The Courage to Be Catholic"" is the best assessment of what went wrong in the Church, what led to the scandal and where we should go from here."
2,"look out here!, inferior reproductions,badly reproduced","The package looks good but is an ovious re production and not ver well re done looks like a kid burned these discs and even the setup is badly done, they play but not very well, and that is if you can push it past the amiture menu. I am not satisfied and will place this seller on my bad list."
5,Port Case,"This case is great. It is simply the sturdiest, most user friendly case with the best erogonomic straps around. I don't know why, but their shoulder strap lightens even the heaviest of loads. It is tough, but it is truly the most comfortable case around. No straps that dig into your shoulder here! The soft neoprin shoulder strap is the most comfortable one I have used. I use it daily and it is always jammed packed with files, it works great. Trust me I have tried them all, this is the best!!..."
1,Packaging needs reworked,I have ordered this set twice and have thus far been unable to try it out because both times it arrived at the door as a broken mess.
2,Poor print quality,"I was very disappointed by the print quality. Very pixelated and with muted colors. I bought this poster after seeing another identical poster (but of higher quality). They must be printing these per order, but without the proper poster printing material, if that makes any sense. Think how a photo would look from your color printer, but printed on regular typing paper, and with toned down coloring. Furthermore, the frame it was shipped in was warped. Customer service from the vendor was excellent however. They gave a full refund without the hassle of repackaging the return."
3,A good guide to a great region,"Glad to see Cadogan is paying attention to this terrific part of Italy. We spent two weeks in Bologna and visited Ravenna, Ferrara, Florence, and Siena (latter two not covered in this book) during that time. Cadogan specializes in giving a complete and very valuable historical and cultural picture of the regions covered in their books. The background is very informative; the only thing we could have desired is more logistical information, buses, trains, opening hours, etc. This information changes frequently but would nevertheless be extremely valuable--perhaps a once-a-year E-Newsletter for people who buy the book? We wasted a lot of time trying to juggle opening hours with public transport schedules."
5,Quickport blanks,"used a few of these to fill in a few holes on a quick port wall plate. These are high quality but my wall plate isn't so I had to file a few edges to get it to fit, but they were perfect on a different wall plate that was much higher quality. Would buy again."
4,Greg Vickers - Folk nostalgia for those of us from the 50's & 60's,"Greg Vickers provides great folk nostalgia for those of us who are folk groupies from the 50's & 60's. Lively, original songs reminiscent of the humor of the likes of Pete Seeger and Arlo Guthrie and very Guthrie-like in voice.Not Quite There"
5,GREAT CLASSIC METAL,I love this album and i cant believe the guys are still together! This is an old album but its really good. If your a Classic Metal fan check out Dio! The best track is The Last In Line...Its old but it still sends a rush throug you body!
3,Good for its time....,"but dated now.'80's Heavy Metal is now so dated that this album lost all its fire only a few years after it was released, and most of those bands from that period have gone the way of the Dodo. The sound of this album is only one part of the problem: the guitars sound thin compared to the heavy albums of today, and the bass and drums are just completely lost in the mix.The other problem goes to the songwriting: nothing wrong with the subject matter, but musically the world has circumnavigated the sun too many times for these standard '80's riffs to cut it anymore.It gets 3 stars simply because it stars RJ Dio. I'm honestly surprised it's even available these days!"
5,Excellent show!!,"Firstly, WB released the volumes for this first season in sets of 4: season 1, vol1, season 1, vol2 and season 1 vol. 3 (to be released in a couple of weeks). People cried foul!, because of the pricing (about 15 bucks, sometimes 11). Now, WB finally listened to its consumers, released a complete season set (a barebone one, but I digress) and people are still crying foul!! Unbelievable.Look, this is a nice set. If you are a fan of the series, buy it. As this title racks up more sales, chances are that they will release a Blue-Ray, with more stuff at some point."
5,World's Sexiest Song,"This has been a favorite album of mine for 40 years!!This is the highlight of both Evie and Chip Taylor's careers, and that's saying something since Chip is also responsible for ""Wild Thing"" and ""Angel of the Morning""!! Evie's voice is remarkable, and Chip's production is lush and deep without burying the vocals.The highlight of the album is the remake of the Troggs song ""Any Way That You Want Me"", which is quite simply the sexiest song that's ever been recorded.Every fan of the '60s should own this album. Every fan of the really good female singers should own this album.(If only the album included Evie's take on ""Angel of the Morning...)"
1,NOT HAPPY,I bought these as a Christmas present for my Dad. When they arrived all the glasses were completely shattered. SO UPSET.
3,Pilsner glasses,"After receiving the first box with 3 broken and 1 glass intact, I contacted the co. and reported damage. They promptly took my info down and processed another order with a credit coming for the first. The second shipment was packed 100 times better this time. It had 3 intact glasses and one with an internal crack from the base 3 quarters up the side. At least I have a total of 4 which is what the original order called for..."
1,Bad Choice,"These glasses are cheap, however, quality is really poor. Highly recommend paying more and buying some other brand."
2,Bottom line: only two songs not available on other DM albums,"There is a lot of good music on this album. Problem is, nearly all of it can be found on other, better Depeche Mode albums, rendering this an unimportant item in the band's discography. The only songs unavailable on other albums, ""Now This Is Fun"" and the peppy, industrial tinged ""Work Hard,"" are not strong enough to warrant spending money to buy this album. Additionally, all of the album's best songs (""People Are People,"" ""Love in Itself,"" ""Get the Balance Right,"" ""Leave in Silence,"" and ""Everything Counts"") are included on The Singles 81>85."
2,Extremly 80s,This CD.... Is OK but not that good. It has some okay songs like People are People and Pipeline but thats about it. Every song has annoying sythenizers that sound really crappy. This band aint that good so dont buy this cd just download the song People are People.
2,Wish it was better..,"The writing style is fine, the research is fair to good compared to others in the field, but he does anyone who is interested in real history a great disservice in promoting this work, because of his horribly shoddy jumps in logic.Even on points that I would agree with him on, or that have been explained and researched much better elsewhere, I can not support him on because of his almost purposeful misreadings as quotes, his constant ruling out of alternatives, and dictums that this is 'necessary' or 'obvious', when it is no such thing.Any first year philosophy or debate student could rip him and his case to shreds, which is a shame, since some of the research is on the right track and quite good.So, I'd skip this one.. his presentation style makes it too hard to be able to tell which points are ludicrous and which are valid."
1,Wish I would have read the Negative Reviews,"This book wasn't at all what I had expected, the 1 star reviews are pretty much dead on, unless you want to read about society's plot to overthrow christian beliefs then there's nothing worth reading in this book."
1,"terrible, just terrible","This book is nothing but pure drivel from a Christian fundamentalist point of view. The author is obviously poorly educated and his rhetoric makes a mockery of academic practice. He claims to quote a variety of authors in order to support his conclusion, and clearly he succeeds, for the works cited are those of either obvious charlatans, right-wing paranoiacs (Nesta Webster! ), anti-semites and obscure writers. Very poor work from an intellectual standpoint.The conclusions in this book are reached only through wild leaps of logic which manage to make light satanic...If you are a fundamentalist Christian like mr Ep the so-called writer you will probably enjoy this book and start living in fear of satanic freemasons after reading it. However, if you feel that paying for a pile of quotes from a bunch of hysterical fanatics to support views that obelisks are evil, you're better off not getting this book."
5,Some of the best rail photography you'll ever see!,"This book pictorializes one of the most fascinating and best places to watch (and photogaph) modern railroading. The author who is also the photographer, expertly captures the drama, the beauty and the complexity of this mainline trackage running through the Tehachapi mountains.The photos are large, colorful, sharply detailed. The vantage points are unique. The lighting in many are simply spectacular, lighting not often associated with this subject matter. The narrative is the icing on the cake.Railfans visit Tehachapi from all over the world. Most of them own this book."
1,WARNING: Sinus attachments don't work with ALL Waterpik dental jets!,"I purchased the Waterpik NA-2 gentle sinuse rinse attachment, expecting it to work with the Waterpik Professional Ultra Dental Water Jet, since that is what was advertised. THEY DON'T FIT IN THIS MODEL, SO DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME PURCHASING BOTH TOGETHER! The sinus attachments are too short, so they can't ""click"" into the water pik. The end result: Water leaks out, and there is no pressure through the sinus attachment. I had to return both items since the Amazon rep couldn't find any sinus attachment to work in the Waterpik Ultra model. It's a shame because I love the small footprint of the Waterpik Ultra, and it comes with a lot of cool attachments. Hopefully Waterpik will come up with something in the near future!"
4,helps with sinus problems,"battling sinus problems for years, I've found this sinus irrigation attachement for the WaterPik device to be very helpful. It keeps sinuses moist and clean - I'd recommend for those that have seasonal sinus problems"
1,DON'T BOTHER,The resolution of this TV is painful to look at. Spend a few more bucks and it will be money well spent in the end! The great deal I thought I got will now be offset by return shipping and exchange costs!
2,Don't waste your time.,"Although it is a very attractive design and price, I have never had glassware so prone to breaking. Within two months, four of the glasses had shattered...while being hand-washed...not touching anything but the sink and a washcloth. Another thing that bothered me about these glasses is the very bottom of the inside of the glass. If you let used glasses set out instead of washing them immediately, the liquid will dry at the bottom of the glass and is very difficult to reach with a sponge or washcloth. The pitcher has been great. I haven't had any problems with it at all. The glasses are such a waste, though. They've convinced me to steer clear of Libbey glassware in the future."
5,The best SAM-e Out There,I really don't know what I'd do without it. Nature Made's SAM-e is effective and reliable. A hundred times better than the prescription meds.
1,Crushed packages,"The product took forever to arrive. Perhaps it was on sale because the packaging was so crushed, one would never buy these tablets from the store. The boxes were packed in suitable bubble wrapping; the package/envelope itself was fine. It was obvious that the boxes had been crushed before mailing. Quite honestly, it made us afraid to use the product as the packages were so distorted we were worried about the integrity of the contents."
3,My puppy's blanky,"Very kute little blanky, but too small for my pup. Nice to have just to have it. Kute little dog ear on the blanky flaps. If it was bigger, it could be more useful for the doggie bed."
4,Essential addition to PC reference library,"Excellent photographs with some of the best ""noncrafty"" projects I've seen. Wide range of information. Only improvement I can suggest would be more specific instructions. Personally, I was looking for a lapis imatative technique, but was not among those covered. But with these minor shortcomings I still would definitely want this book in my library."
5,McDougall Book Lean and Clean,"Dr. John McDougall is that rare doctor in American medicine: One who tells the truth about the drugs or surgery stance of the AMA. Most refreshing is his absolute candor, leading the reader to wonder at times why his medical license is stil in tact. For those who seek medical truth, it doesn't get any straighter John McDougall."
2,Rehash of past postulations,"I read this book before in a different order named ""The McDougall Plan"". It was useful then but I got nothing I can think of new from this book."
5,Reliableon land or Sea,"I carry this knife while diving in the pacific as a Scuba Instructor. It allows me a potent probing tool and anchors me to the sea bed while swimming against currents. also while walking home one night three thugs tried to rob me with a knife. I heald up my Tigershark with a grin and they fled. ""now that's a knife mate"""
3,"Good, but not great","I like a lot of the tracks on this album, particularly I Feel for You, This Is My Night, and Through the Fire, but it started a trend that R&B has not yet recovered from: there is a different producer for almost every track. The presence of exec producer Russ Titelman on almost every track helped to unify the album, but all in all it's not in the same class (to my ears) with my all-time favorite Chaka album, Whatcha Gonna Do for Me. I bought this in album form when it came out, so naturally I'm gonna download the mp3s."
3,chaka khan,"being a chaka khan fan from way back when, this is a must for my cd collection as i have the album"
4,Best way to get started with linux asm,"After looking around for an introduction to assembly in linux, this is the best book I found (well, there's not much competition). I had heard asm is hard, but you'll be up and running very quickly with this book - it's actually quite easy. I have no intention of doing any real programming in assembly, but after learning the basics I have a better idea of what code in a higher level language compiles to, I finally really understand pointers and the difference between the heap and the stack, etc.It loses a point for trying to be an introduction to programming in general. There are better books for that, and better approaches than starting at the lowest level (actually, you *could* build your own chips..). It is not a general reference to assembly, will not take you very deep, and is not intended to. IMHO, it should have been.Anyway, this is the place to go if you want to get started on asm and you use linux (in particular, it's better than the Hyde book)."
5,Just Right,"This bag does just what it was designed for, plus most people don't realize I'm carrying a laptop. My laptop has been well protected through all types of weather and (I must admit) a few bumps and falls. It is the right size to be used as carry on luggage for flights, I have had no problems so far on planes. Carrying the bag is a breeze for the design makes it very comfortable on your back. Very strong material has been used on this bag, I give all my bags a rough time and this one has stood up to all my abuse going on at least six months now. The zippers are very good and have held up well to the overloading this bag takes. I would recommend this bag to anyone."
1,Disappointing product.,Product comes with a polishing cup head (mentioned in text descriptions and pictured on the box) which does not rotate. The bristles not rotating is a disappointment in itself but I feel that the polishing cup not rotating is a deception. :( I will try to return it and don't recommend it despite its low price.
4,war is a racket - it sure is,"Okay people, listen up. Smedley Butler from West Chester, PA was the most decorated marine at the time of this book being written. He tells the truth about why military actions are taken and who benefits.But only thinking people will understand. All others may as well save their money because they will not ""get it"".I am glad that I now have this little book in my library and I know why I believe as I do about this subject."
2,"Kindle Book ""War is a Racket!""","This somewhat historical text may well have it's merits but potential buyers should be aware that this ""Book"" consists of a total of approx. 18 pages. (In words eighteen pages!)What more do I need to say."
3,TO HELL WITH WAR !!!,"My title is how General Butler ends his comments. I liked it and agree with the other reviewers. We all know how profiteers earn big $$$ during wartime, and even during peacetime, as they do well with research,and the routine requirements of training and preparedness. The soldier often pays a deadly price. My only complaint that the book is about the same size of a pamphlet, and the buyer should be made aware. And now, of course, if you search about, you can find it for free on the internet. This is one of the very few times that I felt I had overpaid at Amazon."
1,Horrible Video Quality,"Remember when you used to have a VCR and would sometimes try to watch a video tape that had a picture that kept bouncing up and down until you adjusted the tracking control? Well, that's what this DVD is like. Which is simply PATHETIC.I'm not a videophile by any means, but even so, watching this DVD was a horrendous experience. I turned it off after fifteen or twenty minutes as my eyes and equilibrium could take no more.The narration seemed to be fairly informative, but who can listen when the picture is this bad? What a waste."
5,great value,I WAS A LITTLE HESITANT ABOUT ORDERING AFTER READING OTHER REVIEWS ABOUT THE GLASSES BREAKING SO EASILY. AFTER USING THEM EVERY DAY AND WASHING IN THE DISHWASHER THEY HAVE DONE GREAT. SO FAR NO CRACKS OR BREAKAGE. LOOK GREAT.
2,glasses are too large,I hoped for an assortment of sizes -- starting with juice glasses. These are 16 and 20 oz glasses. Useless to me
2,Over heats,I bought this product thinking that it had good ratings then I put it in my tank the water was always over 80 degrees F even when it was set at 75 degrees!!!!!
3,"Heat output too low for what I needed it for, had to order another product","Got the item - it looks good. I have used many visi-therm products in the past and sooner or later manage to break them when they come out of the water still hot and I forget and the glass gets cracked. Anyhow, I got this to heat up a barrel of water that I was using to recirculate hot water - and it didn't even alter the temperature of the ~40 gallons of water more than 5 degrees even after running overnight. I spent the extra bucks to buy a more industrial product - the heater may work great in an aquarium setting; but I had to be honest and share my disappointment about how much heat it put out for the use I had intended it for when I purchased."
1,I should have read the other review and not buy this,"I brought this for my new 56 gallon tank, thinking that this is a simple device and nothing could go wrong. I ignored the other reviews about the temperature setting. Big mistake. Temperature was at 82F even I turned the knob all the way to the lowest. I cannot return it since I did not keep the packing (thinking nothing could go wrong with this simple device). I will spend more and buy a reputable brand. I will read the reviews."
2,Great Product Fallen On Bad Times,"Have ALWAYS had great satisfaction with every SONY product and have always been willing to pay the higher price for products. Have used the Walkman AM/FM radio for years. Finally, needed to buy new one. During 2001, had to buy THREE (3) of these items. Each ""lost"" the A M stations, the F M stations became limited and finally, the batteries (2 AAA) needed replacement with 15 hours of use. Returned to retailer. Was told to contact manufacturer. The SONY company has not responded. As I said...great product but... something has gone wrong with latest production quality."
3,Poor product from Sony,"Coming from Sony, I expected a very good producthowever I was disappointed. The unit is quitelight and compact but the FM reception is verybad. In Local mode, the audio keeps fading in andout. When switched to DX mode, there is unbearablehissing and static. Got fed up after using it for3 days, am returning it. I used to be impressedwith the general quality of Sony products butnowadays I'm going for other brands like Panasonic."
2,so disappointed i returned it,reception was very poor (constant hiss on favorite local station) power button placement/design poor for real-world storage - put it in a backpack and you can count on it getting bumped and powered on
2,Low Quality,I purchased this 2 years ago for $ 50 which is a ripoff. This radio gets a terrible connection and has static like crazy. Plus it's so small you might lose it and also lose the money you paid for it. Don't buy this am/fm radio go out and get a better and more reliable one.
4,a small gem,"Well-written, honest and engaging telling of 20th century monastic life. Rougeau presents a complex portrait of the monks in all their humanity while focused on the divine. I look forward to his next book and hope it will advance the story of this community."
3,Good but Not Great,"I would agree that this is more of an appreciation than a biography. De Wilde tends to overwrite a bit, but his enthusiasm is infectious."
3,Child of a Rainless Year,"I enjoyed the descriptions of the southwest especially and the storyline for the first half of the book intrigued me, but the mysticism of the ssecond half sorta lost me. However those in my bookclub (it was our monthly choice) who like thie type of book loved it. The colorful descriptions of the people and the house were its strength. I found the book and ordered it easily through Amazon when it became our monthly bookclub selection."
3,OK Movie,"This movie plot was wonderful and true, but the acting of John Lithgow was a bit disappointing. Morgan Freeman was great as always but his role was very limited. After seeing it once, I doubt I will ever take it out of the cabinet and watch it again. I think the story could have been told much better by another actor."
4,good movie,"This was a simple yet good movie. All actors did real well. I would've liked to have seen the ""answer"" told in a flashback so that we could see why his men were keeping quiet. However it was still a good movie."
1,No Good,"Well, I have to agree with the last few reviews in that MTV sure does want to make a buck and ruin another part of our culture. Well we won't let them. First Amp was ok, I own both, but the only attractive song on here is Fatboy Slim and if you like that song you should already own You've come a long way, Baby, so don't waste your money and buy some real electronic music, moonsine records, or uc music if you like hard house. Let's hope they don't make Amp 3."
2,Just Another Remix Comp....sigh,"Having already bought Amp 1, I was looking forward to its sequel, even after having read that it would be an album focusing on the hip hop/electronica influence. I hate to admit, but I was pretty disappointed with the album as a whole. I did enjoy the new Fatboy Slim track, but the remainder of the album seemed to lack any real electronica or techno influence, aside from a bit of scratching and sampling. True, there was the Adam F drum n' bass track, but I found it wearying and taxing to have to listen to Method Man and KRS-One. After all, I wanted an electronica album, not just another remix comp..."
4,"not exactly electronica, but just as good","although this compilation isn't what most people would call ""electronica"", it's just as good. maybe this is what electronica has morphed into, maybe not. all in all, this is a great collection of MUSIC, no matter what genre you define it as."
4,Who defined electronica anyway?,"I don't know why so many of you guys are slagging down this CD for not being ""electronica"". There is no such thing as ""electronica"" anyway - as far as I can tell, that word is simply a marketing term dreamed up by MTV in an attempt to package the UK dance diaspora to the US. Ask any of the big ""electronica"" artists and they will ALL tell you that they count hip hop as one of their greatest influences. KRS-1 and the Jungle Brothers are only getting due respect when people like Goldie and Aphrodite want to work with them. This is a cool album and a pretty good sample of some of the sounds that are shaping music in the UK right now."
4,For all students of the warrior ethic,"For those who don't know, the legendary US Army Rangers are the most highly trained infantry unit on earth. The Rangers are also the proudest unit in the US Army due to their long and colorful history that dates all the way back to the 1600's. This book is an exhausting and detailed history of the US Army Rangers. By reading about the horrific battles the Rangers have fought (including the one at the beginning of Saving Private Ryan) you will instantly respect the heritage and culture of the Army Ranger. So read this book and then knock out a hundred pushups for the Rangers! Hooaah!"
2,HELP,I cant figure out how to make takoyakis-- makes me want to throw this game out of the window.. this is NOTHING Like animal crossing and was a total waste of money!
2,music match is a no go with this player,"This player will not handle encypted WMAs that are found on Music match pay service. Company promises fix in 2 weeks. We""ll see.1/1/2004 Still no support for encrypted WMA files for Musicmatch and other pay per download services,"
3,it'z okay~,"I bought this player 6 months ago and now I have to buy a new one. Something is wrong with it mechanically...and it won't play anymore. It worked yesterday, so I don't know what could have happened. The player is very light and you will be sure to get lots of stares. The sound is great and the earbuds are satisfactory. The battery keeps falling out though, but it'z nothing a little piece of duct tape can't fix. The program is also very easy to use~ I would buy this player again."
4,almost perfect,"This littel player is GREAT! its a lot better than other players. the only snags are: you have to be carefull of the battery door, it looks u could brake it ezly. and the 128mb memory is good but i would have preferd more space(im a teenager, i listen to LOTS of music), i would have gotten the 256mb, but the more memory the more the price. the FM tuner is GREAT. the only thing is u cant do anything on it while u r recording. but other than that its an amzing littel pice of equiptment. i love the looks of people when they see it and say ""what in the world is that?"" cause its so small but holds lots of music. it has EXELENT sound. and u can change many options in the player. so... i hope u found this helpfull. BUY IT!"
1,Dee-press-ing film,"I don't EVER wake up thinking about movies, bur this one did it to me. Sooooooo lacking any adult thinking or wisdom. Hope? Nope. Second chances? Nope. Facing consequences? Double nope. Would not recommend."
3,"Good, Not Great, But Horrible Editing!","Of the two books I've read in this series so far, the storyline is pretty good. Unfortunately, the editing in the electronic version of this particular book was awful! I'm used to a few gramatical and typographical errors in books, but they happen so often in this one that it is a bit distracting. I don't know if it's the same in the hard copy, but if so, amazon may want to run some sort of editing program on ebooks before posting them for sale."
2,Unfortunately Addicting,"I can't believe I invested the time to read the second book in this series. It is a time waster, but hard to put down. I'm fighting off the urge to continue reading the rest of the series, but I know I'll regret wasting the time if I give in. Ugh!"
2,"Fun, but aggravating to read","Even for $6 I would expect not have to mentally rewrite as I read. If the Kindle is incapable of presenting a piece of work without even a modicum of editing/proof reading, perhaps it shouldn't try, or add a warning and stick it in the Penny Books. Doesn't the author care how his work comes across to the public?If you can fill in the missing blanks, work out the correct replacement words, realize that a century is a hundred (not thousand) years, deal with bad grammer and formatting, this is a fun sci-fi.mutantbead, PA"
1,"QuincyJ, I Said-- Bobby Darrin, not Bobby McFerrin","""Mack the knife"" hurls as it sounds like ""don't worry be happy"" at the beginning. Don't waste your time, be happy with the other sinatra classics."
3,Tastes good however.....,"Certainly this syrup tastes very good. However at the risk of TMI, I became extremely flatulent because of this product. As a result, this is a one time only purchase."
5,Best sugar-free syrup!,"I have tasted all of the sugar-free maple syrups on the market -- none of them even comes close to Joseph's. Once you try it you will never be satisfied with the others. My husband and I first had it at the Original Pancake House in Falls Church, VA. (We both follow a diabetic food plan.) When we first tasted it, we grabbed the bottle to make sure that it was really sugar-free (it is!). The consistency is rich and thick and the maple flavor tastes just like real maple syrup. I don't know how they do it, but Josephs had made an amazing sugar-free syrup. We buy it at the Original Pancake House or Whole Foods."
5,Great Taste,I just received my order of this syrup today along with a few other low-carb items. I made pancakes using the atkins flour mix and both tasted great. I am a amazon prime member and was very pleased with how quickly my order was delivered. I will be recommending this item to friends and ordering more soon.
3,"Tastes great, but BEWARE!","This is easily the best tasting sugar free breakfast syrup I've ever had. I couldn't really tell the difference between this and regular maple syrup. The key to it is the sugar alcohol in it called maltitol. It has nearly the same chemical structure as sucrose (table sugar), and almost the same amount of sweetness. However, maltitol is not easily digested, and I paid the price for it. Being the moron that I am, I decided to put a ton of this stuff on my Eggo's because it tasted so good. However, not long afterwards, I developed the worse gas, bloating, and cramping that I've ever experienced, and it lasted for at least 6 hours. This is a warning: CONSUME THIS SYRUP IN SMALL QUANTITIES!!! They really should put a warning on the bottle. Anyways, as far as taste goes, this get 5+ stars compared to other sugar free syrups, but it gets knocked a few stars because of the extreme intestinal discomfort it caused me. So, once again, tastes great, but BEWARE!"
5,I buy this by the case!,"This is, by FAR, the best sugarfree syrup I've ever tried and I've tried them ALL, I think! In fact it might be the best syrup, bar none, apart from pure maple syrup. If you're doing low-carb, or diabetic, or just try to avoid sugar in general, this product is excellent. Others I've tried have been either sickeningly sweet, artificial-tasting, gloppy, or too thin. This is thick, luscious, and delicious!The ONE caveat is that it IS, as another reviewer has pointed out, a sugar alcohol (maltitol) and if used in too great a quantity may well cause ""gastrointestinal distress"" to put it nicely!I never have a problem with it when I stick to the recommended serving size of 1/4 cup - which doesn't SOUND like much but is very adequate for a serving of pancakes or waffles (low-carb for me please!) or added to recipes such as barbecue sauce or others requiring maple syrup. I even use it to make a delicious pecan pie!"
2,Head is fine; hose is way too stiff,"I got a pair of these for our new master bath setup, and ended up swapping the hard white-plastic hoses for the chrome-colored pseudo-metallic hoses on our old Shower Massages. The white ones were inflexible, wouldn't straighten out, and interfered with the hanging rack that my wife's shampoo, etc. sit on.An older model that we got at Costco had a slightly different head, which had a ""spray and stream"" setting this one doesn't have. If you like having a concentrated stream as well as a spray that gets you wet quickly (and don't want the massage feature running), try to find that model."
3,Sometimes frustrating for my toddler to open the container,The egg carton is very difficult to open. It is supposed to be educational but he would rather throw the eggs and shells around the house. Oh well it was cheap so I can't complain much.
5,Suprisingly great toy!,"My 9 month old daughter really enjoys this toy. While she's too young to be able to use the ""learning"" aspects of this toy (putting the chicks into the matching holes, matching the outer shell faces to the chick's faces), she thoroughly enjoys taking the eggs apart and playing with them. This is one of the few toys that can occupy her for 20 minutes solid, and my husband and I enjoy it too - we've made a game out of trying to put the eggs back together faster than she can take them apart. Money well spent! And hopefully this toy will grow with her, since there are many aspects to it!"
5,Love these glasses!,"These are the perfect everyday glasses, especially if you have kids around -- they're sturdy and weighted (bot not TOO heavy), and hold up to years of use with no problems at all!"
3,Mehh,"Was sent correct book, but there were LOTS of markings/highlights/bend pages/papers left inside of book..You pay for what you get, just remember that!"
4,2 bowling ball roller bag with handle,My ONLY complaint is not the space. It's the lack of a good handle at the top of the case for picking up. When locked down the sliding handle slips because it doesn't lock tight enough and there's nothing else to do but grab the center (layed flat) handle when moving stairs. Other than that it's a fantastic buy for the price.
4,Solid roller bag,This item was as described on the KR website. Handles two balls easily and has room for my shoes and a few items in the side pouch. Rolls easily. Wish there was a separate pouch on the other side for other items.
1,I guess I got what I paid for...,I bought this bag a little more than a year ago. Shortly after purchasing it I had to re-cement the vel-cro on the strap. Then there is the problem with the sliding handle. It slips and doesn't lock tight enough and two weeks ago the side-pocket zipper slipped off track and I couldn't put it back. That was the final straw so I do not recommend this bag.
1,Banta Genealogy----A hard to figure out compilation,"I have read a former review of this book. Perhaps I don't have the same book; but I found the text to be very poorly written, difficult to connect the genealogical dots, and filled with a numerical ancestry formulation which is NEVER EXPLAINED. My copy is called: ""The Banta Genealogy---A Frisian Family"" By Theodore M. Banta (NY: 1893); Reprinted by ""Bergen Historic Books"" (NJ: 1997).I am at a loss to figure out the numerical cryptic codes in this book. I feel this book lacks comprehensive historic continuity. It is confusing. Yes, I have found my ancestors; but this book lacks clarity."
1,Terrible Book!,This book is simply terrible and not worth any money let alone the money being asked for it. BOTH authors are venomous loud mouths who rarely have anything nice to say about anyone that does not agree with them. One of the co-authors is so vile one has to wonder if he is even a Christian.
2,the castle sunk,what time is it? is there best and ice cream castle is there worst.aside from jungle love and my drawers this album lost the magic and vibe of wtii.needless to say the group was never the same without jam&lewis.
2,BAD TRANSFER TO CD!!,"This album was FANTASTIC in CASSETTE format.Unfortunately it was transfered to CD in analog instead of being digitally remastered and the sound quality is AWFUL,I only gave it 2 stars because of the sound quality.Had this CD been digitally remastered however,I would have given it a 5 star rating.What a shame,guess I will just have to enjoy it on cassette.As for my CD of this album.....guess I will just use it as a drink coaster."
5,Excellent Documentry,"This movie addresses many issues the US financial system dealt with. This is one of the first documentaries that show the solution to many of the problems society deals with can be fixed by the individual taking responsibility, rather than looking to the government to the solution.There are many great interviews. My favorite is with Salem Abraham; however, all of the interviews are very informative. I have recommended this movie to many of my old professors to show their students. Also, many of friends who don't work in the financial industry found this movie enjoyable to watch.This is just another great product from Michael Covel. This is a great office gift for the holidays.Buy this movie!"
1,Save ones money & time and read a book...,"Just don't bother.There's ZERO to learn about trend trading. The rest is drivel.Just about the most boring, off topic movie i have watched.Use the time from not watching this movie and read a book. Any book."
5,By Far Best Shower Head I've Owned To Date!!!,Great Showerhead for the price! Easy to Install. Nice water power! Would buy two more if Amazon still sold them!!
4,Romantic and Fun!,This was my first Lynsay Sands book. This was one of the most intertaining romance books that I've ever read. The chemistry between Hugh and Willa was fantastic! They had a lot of passsion and they were just plain fun. The mystery surrounding Willa's birth and name was just as interesting as the romance between Hugh and Willa.Overall a highly intertaining read.Sensuality rating 4 out of 5
4,Eye horizontal; nose vertical,"A beautiful and inspirational film for those (like myself) who are relatively new to buddhist zen practice and thought. The film is a celebration of the long lineage of teachers and practitioners of sitting meditation (zazen) as a path to the relief of suffering for all beings (""To study the self is to forget the self""). The film focuses on the life of Dogen, a 13th century monk whose search for authentic zen teachings and practice moves him to bring the practice of sitting meditation to all people. The fundamental elements of zen buddhism teachings....that the essence of enlightenment is accepting what is rather than grasping for what we want or pushing away what we don't want... is beautifully illustrated in this film. Even a cursory reading about Dogen via Wikipedia or some similar source will enhance the meaning of the movie by giving the events portrayed some historic context."
1,No service,"My cardio cruiser made lot of noice. The pulley cable was brokenafter a year of use. I called them and placed an order for a replacement, but it was never shipped. I called and emailed them many times and never got any reply. It looks like them don't want to provide any service."
1,coyote stories markings disapointment,"Coyote Stories book received was a discard from a library and had black stamp marks on book page inside stating that, other library markings on binding. Just was not nice looking. Would not have order it, if they had at least share that. Condition was not what was expected and we were disapointed.."
2,Don't Believe The Hype,"This CD is boring- somewhat original but boring. The only good song on it is ""Glamorous Life"" and I downloaded that. Skip this unless you're over the age of 40. Definetly skip Trina's ""The Glamorest Life"" which is 100% trash."
2,Higher Authority too much about Mormons,"Stephen White is a good suspense writer. However, I find in this case White did do his homework, but reading the book I found it to be way too much about Mormons and not enough suspense. I am more interested in the story line and not so much in the background information which is what White did."
1,GET OVER IT!!!,"At first I thought the Mormon bashing was sort of funny, then it got old. Real old. I've lived in ""small town"" Utah for 37 years and I've never heard myself or anyone else refered to a gentile. As for the plot; lame, unbelievable story."
2,Slow moving and boring...,"Wow, I can't believe this was the same author who wrote the previous Alan Gregory novels. I am usually half way through one of Stephen White's books in a day or two. It took me 2 weeks to finish this book. It was nice that Lauren was the main character in this story, but I missed reading about the other characters that are usually present in Alan Gregory's life. I am hoping that the next novel is more like Stephen White's previous efforts."
4,An Interesting Adventure,"I found the book interesting an replete with information regarding the setting and attitudes of the characters. Though I cannot say that it is the best book I have read, it certainly held my attention to the end."
3,the soundtrack hasn't aged well,"back in 84 this soundtrack was tight but today 15 years later it's average at best.while when doves cry,babby i'm a star,and purple rain still sound good the rest of the disc haven't stood the test of time.for me it's no where as strong as sott,1999,dirty mind,prince,or even as good as lovesexy."
3,Music from Purple Rain review,"Songs were the same as the motion picture, but not fully extended like i would have wanted. I was a bit disappointed about the songs being shortened, and my CD case was cracked even before i opened it. i wasn't very happy"
3,Has Some Great Moments.,"I remember hearing a lot of these songs years ago when this album was first released. Listening to it now, no doubt it's got a good production, musicianship and some exceptional tracks--but there are also some songs that sound a bit like filler though. ""Computer Blue,"" ""Darling Nikki,"" and ""Baby I'm a Star"" aren't that great. That aside, some of the best are ""I would Die 4 U,"" ""The Beautiful Ones,"" and ""Take Me with You."" Not a classic in my opinion, but does have some great moments."
2,Missing Best Song!,I was so excited to find Purple Rain on DVD and CD through Amazon. I was listening to the CD and waited patiently for the last song PURPLE RAIN to play and it stopped just before it started. This is two times I have received a CD from Amazon that the CD seemed to be missing songs.
1,Is this considered music?,"There are a couple of clever songs here and the band sounds okay, but frankly I just don't understand how anyone could enjoy this album that much. In a couple of the songs, it seems that the lyrics are just being screeched or screamed out. Who wants to hear a bunch of screeching? Prince (or whatever he calls himself now) is too weird for me and there is so much more good rock music out there that this just isn't worth having in anyone's collection. Maybe this was hot stuff at the time it came out; I just acquired it recently and after only one listen I am dumping it."
5,Another Winner!,I have found this book to be a valuable addition to my classroom. I have used and/or adapted a number of the ideas and plan to use almost every idea in my classroom this year. I teach second and third grade and find the ideas acceptable for all my students.
2,Not what I expected,"These are not what I was expecting, I was expecting to get the larger tapioca pearls. And it was not the ones shown in the picture, will buy from somewhere else next time."
2,Not what I expected,"Nars is a high quality product. However, the color of this lipstick was not as described at all and now I have 3 tubes (because I couldn't buy just one) that I will hopefully be able to give away."
5,Classic and Hefty,"These classic and durrable mugs are both attractive and heavy. They frost well and keep beer cold nicely. They arrived packed well, and none were broken or cracked. I purchased them for a gift, and the recipient was just as delighted with them."
2,Broken mug,One mug arrived broken. It was a gift so I was wondering if it could be replaced. That was the only problem with the order.
3,"Good product, but one is damaged","The glasses are great, but one of them is damaged... undecided if it's worth it bothering with the returning these.They seem a bit heavy, but I like them"
5,Ester-C,"This is a great product for those who's stomachs cannot handle regular Vit C. It doesn't taste great, but is easy to cover up taste in a juice, etc. and is worth it so that you get adequate Vit C daily in your body."
4,Surf and Turf for Godzilla,"I don't get the giant Lobster except even Godzilla has to eat sometimes. NOT one of his better flicks.I like the Megalon folick, though. It reminds us that the story of a sunken continent with an advanced civilization (in Asian cultures the island of MU) is almost universal. The premise as that violence never solves anything. MU is being destroyed by nuclear tests so it unleashes its protector, Megalon, to stop the destruction. Godzilla comes to the rescue. Very ironic since the lizard was created from nuclear tests. The robot is interesting but unnecessary. Still it's a nice flick to watch on a rainy afternoon."
4,Colony,This book is by one half of the team that brought us the Red Dwarf TV Series and books. This is a funny book set on a multi-generational space ship. If you enjoyed Red Dwarf I think you will enjoy this book.
5,A must have!!!,"My 3 year old daughter is OBSESSED over this movie right now! She knows all the songs by heart and talks about the characters. There isn't a day in this house that I don't hear her singing ""I'm just like you, you're just like me..."" The CD is a great bonus!We've never seen the other 3 movies so I can't compare to those. But I find it interesting that one reviewer mentioned the lack of the Kelly dolls. One of my daughters favorite parts is at the end when they appear. I wonder why they weren't in the movie more if they are loved? Still a GREAT buy!"
3,Barbie movie (Princess and the Pauper),Entertaining movie but I was expecting it to stick to the original story line of the Princess and the pauper.
5,I can't wait to see this one,I have seen all of the Barbie animated movies and they are wonderful. I expect this one to follow the same path.
5,Everybody loves it.,"This is my first ever Barbie movie bought. I got this from a store while browsing other things and my 3 year old daughter saw this and would not put it down so Mommy gave in and bought it anyway since it was a bargain. I would say, I'm glad I got it as my kids love this movie. I'm surprised how good the animation and the singing is as good as Disney movies. I have this on my dvd player on my car and have been playing over and over but my kids still love it and keep them quiet. I should say, it saves my sanity while driving :)"
2,Made me feel broody and cranky,"Don't be fooled by the fancy-pants pink cover with the kitschy coffee cup on the front - C&KF; is no chick-lit offering. Brooding, sad, frustrated, unhappy, disgruntled - all adjectives which describe the main character, who is going through a shift in her life where she is being forced to finally decide what she wants and needs to be fulfilled.Most readers will see the end coming, and there are no surprises here, other than the fact that I'm surprised I was able to finish this dry novel. Not particularly recommended."
1,Minor work,"Altman made some great films, but this isn't one. There's too much tuneless 70s music to pad out the time, the 'story' is slight and unsubtle, Paul Dooley is fine but Marta Heflin seems to be in a daze for the film. My dvd copy had such wobbly sound it was unlistenable, especially the classical stuff."
5,A GREAT BOOK,again another great book i read as a child and have so since bought for my daughter....a great read for kids!!!!
5,Remembered it from childhood- Always rememebered!,One of those books you read as a child and always remember. Reread it and still enjoyed the book! Great book for anyone to read as a child or again as an adult!
3,DVD,Good video. However in the video Daffy pretends to be a monster and scares the other characters. This scard my 3 year old especially at bedtime.
5,"An excellent tool, one to buy","This book was reccomended by tutors as one of three books to buy at the start of our Fine Art degree course. I sort of chuckled, slightly bemused when I skipped through it for the first time, but I am now in the middle of my second year and I find it more and more useful as time goes on. I now understand more about what goes on in the world of art and in the mind of the artist and what I am now reading makes more and more sense, the reasoning behind artistic approaches and the thought trains behind individual artist's work I can now follow using this book. I highly reccomend the work even though it takes a while to take it all in, afterall there is not much time to fit in the social life at Uni never mind actual study ! This book will be invaluable in my third year. It is well written and has enabled me to understand other peoples work so valued in art study and now accessable to myself having read it."
3,Good but not great...,I thought the video was pretty good. Some of the exercises worked great and so me not so great. I have a 1/2 black lab and 1/2 beagle. The exercise on walking the dog did not work for me because I had to bend over so far to give him a treat. They use a tall dog in the video and it worked much better. I would recommend it to anyone before they signed up for classes. It is definatley worth spending the $15 before you spend $100 + on classes.
3,Pretty basic,"This is a nice entry level video for a new dog owner. I was hoping for a little more advanced training and/or tricks. All the basic obedience training is there and it is well explained and demonstrated. If you teach your dog most of these commands, you will be very happy with your pet. We had already taught our dog most of the commands on the video before we got it, but still picked up some valuable information."
4,Limited clicker training,"While this has good training instructions,the on-line review over emphasized the clicker training aspects. The DVD talks about clicker training but does not show actual training with it, as it does with other ways of training."
4,Great training tool,"This dvd is one of the best training tools out there and worth every penny. If the previous negative reviewers would have spent their time watching the training techniques and not the set design, where it was filmed or the professionalism of the photography, they would have picked up some valuable insight in training their dogs. This wasn't a dvd movie for entertainment, it was an instructional dvd that did just that and I actually found it entertaining and I thought the instructors were very clear and easy to understand. Our dog was responding in the first 5 minutes. I was pleasantly surprised at how much information there was. Again--great dvd--worth every penny."
2,Fun but..,My son and I had a great time building the radio and he learned alot. But the speaker volume was so low you had to hold it up to your ear to hear it. We had to return it. I don't know if all the speakers are like this or mine was defective. If you get one and the speaker works let me know and I will buy another.
5,Will she ever talk again?,This is about a girl who will not talk. She has been through a tramatic deal.Her mom has sent her away to a private school. She didn't make progress at the hospitol so this is where she finds her self. Will she ever talk agen? Will she be releaved of the stress this berden has given her?
2,so much to tell you,"The first time I read this book was in English class. Myteacher made it out to be a great book with an excellent plot. Whilethe plot was enjoyable, I was not amused. I am not saying that this is the worst book I have ever read in my entire life, however, I have read better. If I read this book on my own for, lets say, summer reading, I would have never continued reading after the first entry. The fact that I read it with my class forced me to understand each entry and realize all the examples of symbolism. Perhaps the book was just not my type. Or, on the other hand, maybe the events were just a little unrealistic. I WOULD reccomend this book to anyone who likes to read about real life encounters. This book, like any other, is worth a chance."
1,I Have So Much To Tell You,"The book ""So Much To Tell You"" is about a girl who had an accident. Since this accident the girl, Marina, will not talk to anyone. Due to this fact the book is not written in dialogue but instead it is written in the form that Marina's English class journal is written. This format makes the book very confusing. Because of the confusion that the format causes the books intricate plot is very difficult to follow. In conclusion, I did not like the book ""So Much To Tell You"" due to it's hard to follow plot and confusing journal like text."
2,Horn Co.,"-::-.'`..' `..'`.-:|:-l[* I do not feelthat ""So Much To Tell You"" is as good as everyone glamers itup to be. I did not enjoy this book as much as I thought I would. The event that the story was based on did not stop my hunger for an amazing storyline. If you are into books that make you never want to put this book down, ""So Much To Tell You"" is not the book for you. I felt that this book was one of the most boring books I have read.*]l-::-.'`..' `..'`.-:|:-"
4,Church Elder,"Fabulous Book on Christian Faith and and excellent model for the Christian Walk. This is a deep theological book, where each chapter builds a deeper understanding who God is and how He fulfills all man's needs and desires. The author does an excellent job of mixing bible verses and personal applications, plus puts the readers interest at the forefront. The author also combines the trials of faith with the rejoicing of overcoming temptation. This is not a book you can say I am going to read it cover to cover. After every few pages you will reflect on how this fits into my life story and your faithful journey.Excellent book for early believers to very mature christians."
3,"Inventor, Astronomer, and Rebel","Galileo Galilei was one of the world's greatest scientist. He developed the telescope. With it, he discovered Jupiter's moon and hundreds of stars. He declared that Earth was not in the centre of the universe with the sun revolving around it. Galileo proved that the Earth was acctually revolving around the sun. The Church found out and home arrested him. Galileo's methods was the birth of modern science."
4,Works but takes a little getting used to,"It keeps the bed comfortable on cold nights, but the wires in the pad do take a little getting used to. Also, the connectors for the thermostat controls are right at your feet. All in all, I'm happy with the pad, but only after getting used to the odd placement of the connectors."
5,a diy person,"I have used Autolite products all my life, and this ignition wire set is a very good product. From the appereance to the performance, it is what it does very well.. And not to mention the price, i am a very happy customer.. I will do it all over again.."
3,One nozzle split in our hands - other two are great,"Nice grips and overall seem like a good value when first taken out of the box but the small nozzle literally split during first use - sending for a replacement as it was obviously manufacturing defect. Other two nozzles; the hand wand and variable sprayer are nice but VERY strong on some settings. For example, the hand wand is capable of sending out a 20 foot stream on one of the settings. Literally! If not careful, it will destroy your plants on all but a few of the settings. I'm giving the set one more try as originals obviously had defects."
4,Just great music,"A livelier and equally genuine follow-up to their almost perfect album, South San Gabriel, Love You Just the Same is another piece of strong song-writing, singing, and good old rock and roll. Blends bitterness with country laziness, a sense that however angry any of this might make you, none of that will matter anyway. It will remind you of Uncle Tuppelo or the best Wilco, without being at all derivative. These guys are too good to be unknown, but they're probably not packaged commercially enough to get the kind of distribution their talent deserves. Centro-matic's strength is just great music."
3,Spyderco makeover,"This knife and the serrated edge version i just bought are not the same quality or exactly the same design as the ones i bought at a hardware store 2 or 3 years ago. The main noticable difference is the checkering on the handle is much rougher than that on the older ones. the the blade has a higher rise to the finger hole, too. Overall the quality seems to have slipped a bit from what i have expected from Spyderco. More like the Chinese knife i bought from Wal-mart for $1.00."
5,A BONE CRUNCHING ACCOUNT OF REAL LIFE IN THE DARK CONTINENT,Capstick has done it again. The only author I've read that can put you in the thick of the hunt and the jaws of the beast! It doesn't matter if it's the story about maneating lions or being dragged down under in the muddy depths by a croc. By the time you read the first paragragh your hooked. And the lights are on all night long..... again!
5,A CHILLING YET FACTUAL ACCOUNT OF LIFE AND DEATH IN THE BUSH,"Africa has indeed moved into the modern world in many respects,yet a part of this mysterious land remains a dangerous environment for man. Indeed a place where man is also prey as well as predator.Mr Capstick has provided a window through which we can view this world from the safety of our own home.It is exciting to see through the eyes of one who has been there and done that !"
3,Richard Benjamin appreciation,"Just respects to Richard Benjamin. He backed up bigger comedy stars superbly. This is a great example. He is put upon as usual, doing the heavy lifting. He's easy to underestimate because he truly ""supports"" as a supporting actor. He provides the grounding and the logic- the relatable guy..."
5,Uni-vests weights,"I bought the vest and additional weights as a gift for my nephew. I have not personally seen the items, but they came in a timely manner and were as described."
2,If you don't want a thorough review of Spanish...,"I found this book to be succint and easy to comprehend, but it left out some important grammar and vocabulary topics. In fact, the majority of the book was composed of practice tests, which were way too easy. When I took their tests, I ""scored"" a 760. However, when it came to the actual test, I got a 640. It was pretty disappointing, especially since I've had four years of Spanish. I reccomend Barron's book. I bought it to study for a retake and found it to be much more complete. It helped me to get a 760, but this time for real."
4,Larry Coryell's Funky Good Time,"This sounds like Larry and the boys just wanted to plug in and have some fun, and that they did! Some of Larry's greasiest, bluesy funk ever put down on tape, he snarls, growls and moans the blues in his own inimitable fashion with great support from the other musicians. The real highlights are the last 3 tunes, ""Tyrone"" (a Larry Young piece), ""The Jam With Albert"" and ""Organ Blues"".Nowhere near as complex and wild as his Eleventh House stuff or things like ""The Restful Mind"" or ""Spaces"", but VERY worthwhile if you like to hear Larry get down and have some fun with that universal language of musicians, The Blues, check this out!"
2,Our experience with this double stroller,"I have a 4-month old and a 20-month old, and I needed a double stroller that was light weight and compact. This one seemed to fit the bill, but we've constantly had problems with it...The first one we got, the rivet in the back broke after a month, we were in the process of getting our baby out of the stroller when the rivet broke. The baby fell out of it and landed on the ground. A few scratches, but nothing serious ! We took it back to the store and they replaced it with another new one, exactly the same model. Once again, a month in, and while I was trying to unfold the stroller, the kickbar in the back that you need to step on to fold and unfold the stroller bent ! Now, it's almost impossible to fold and unfold the stroller.The design is great. It's well thought out and it's actually a neat little stroller. The problem is that it keeps breaking !"
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS THAT THIS IS ATB'S WORST TO DATE.THE OTHER SINGLE RELEASE ""HUMANITY"" IS GREAT.....I HOPE THIS WAS NOT ATB VOCALS......IS WAS BAD...I COULD SING BETTER THAN THIS!ATB STICK WITH THE WOMEN SINGERS....I LOVE ATB,,,,NO SILENCE WAS GREAT....THIS JUST LEFT ME ILL...HE SHOULD HAVE LEFT THE SONG ALONE...IT WAS GREAT THE ORIGINAL WAY...."
3,It was not done that well,"Just a short note to inform other readers:. It is obvious that information from many sources are put together in this book without a careful review; consequently, there are quite a few inconsistent info.. This book is not well organized.I do not recommend this book."
3,wanted the WHOLE game not a season's summary,"I spent a lot of time surfing trying to find THE GAME, and the advertising of this product made me believe it so. So it is nice but not what I was looking for. Does it actually exist? If it does, I would still buy it."
2,One-sided...,"I have bought the ""Superbowl I-XL"" along with this and I have to say that I didn't enjoy this review as ""Superbowl I-XL"" season reviews.This disc covers only the Colts season and Superbowl, and you don't have a clue of what is happening in the league, making this only a pure celebration of the Colts.In Superbowl I-XL you have the complete coverage of the season, at least from the main teams, the ones that head to the Superbowl.Buy it only if you are a Colts fan, otherwise wait for a balanced review from NFL films."
3,You get what you pay for,"I needed a cheap chain for my pocket watch. This chain is just that. It is what I expected and preformed its function. My watch has a key for winding which must just be slipped on the same ring as the watch. It looks the part for the most part and is strong enough for what I am doing when I have my pocket watch (coat and tie type affairs, not ever day)."
2,well-written but uncritical look at climate change,"As the climate change hysteria begins to unravel this book continues to lose its legitimacy and credibility. The book does give evidence for global warming but the evidence that it is manmade is lacking. Surprisingly, the author does not resort to political hysterics til the end.The book is well written. The author writes in a captivating way that kept my attention and sympathies throughout. It is divided into chapters that possess different 'evidences' for the 'inevitable' climate catastrophe. Some of these chapters are interesting.The author does write with an air that the 'science is settled' which I always find disturbing and disingenuous. The truth is, is that climate is a vastly complex phenomenon that we understand very poorly as do our feeble attempts of modeling it.My recommendation is to read it, but also read a book critical of reality of manmade climate change."
5,The Red Sea Rules,A wonderful book for study and quick application to everyday life as well as times of trouble. I's one of those books you'll want extra copies to share with others!
5,"An eye opening book, that you will read again, and again !","My Niece told me about this book, and once I ordered my Kindle Fire from Amazon, I downloaded this book. I found/am finding my self thinking of my faith, and how much more I need to believe in my Faith and the Lord more. I love this book, and think that everyone would benefit from reading it."
1,Low Pressure,"Could not get over 3 PSI and was closer to 1 PSI. Engine would not run over an idle. Called Holley tech line and they concluded the pump was defective. Returned the pump.On the positive side,,,, Amazon did promptly refund the cost and shipping, as well as return shipping.Although the Holley pump was defective,, I am very happy with Amazon and the return action."
2,breaks easily,"I bought and used until the housing broke where it latches (latches at opening to insert batteries). I tried to repair, but this is not easily fixed. The plastic piece cannot be glued. Because of the odd shape it is not easily taped. I am a person who breaks few things, because I am gentle and cautious. I think this product is made of plastic that is not durable. This probably held up for 50 or more frothing uses before breaking.As a frother it works well if kept in the middle of the container, but not if it is held at the sides."
1,Impossible for me to open & close,It took 2 of us to get the frother apart and then we couldn't get it back together. We couldn't get the holes for the release buttons to go over them. This gadget takes strong agile fingers. I'm returning this and getting another like we already have. somehow I didn't find it yesterday when I ordered this one. Do not recommend!
5,Great little gadget,I had my wisk for over a year and it performed wonderfully. The batteries last quite a while and even though other reviewers found changing them complex I think that reflects on them more than the unit. Mine died only after I was careless and got it very wet; don't do that. I'm going to buy another one now.
5,Amazing lattes,I purchased this latte frother over a year ago after some research. I had the big and expensive latte machine which I never used because it was so large to keep on my counter. This little frother works so well. I sometimes use it just to add froth to an inexpensive cup of coffee and milk. I gave my big machine to my daughter and now just use this!
1,Au Revoir to BonJour,I purchased this BonJour to replace my older Bodum Frother which I had for several years before it stopped working. The BonJour I had for a little over a month before it stopped working. In short I am now looking for a new frother and it won't be a BonJour.
2,Alas! Maybe another brand?,"I bought this a couple of years ago and used it infrequently. Until the last few weeks, it performed beautifully. The froth was just right and it only took seconds to create ""espresso-like cafe."" This morning I took it from its stand to ""froth"" another cup of coffee. Alas! The rubber housing had rotted exposing the batteries. When I touched the rubber it crumbled and fell into pieces. I am doubtful if I will buy this brand again. The life is too short for me. Another brand would surely outlive this one."
4,frother,"The BonJour Primo Latte Frother works well. I am pleasd with its ability, quietness and ease of cleaning. I would buy it again."
5,THE BEST!,This is perfect! Just what I had been looking for. I plan to buy another to take when I travel.
3,Design Flaw....but I LOVE it,"I had never used a frother before, and I love it. Makes stirring drinks a snap. My kids used it for hot chocolate, tea, etc.... I use it for latte's.ONE PROBLEM:The battery release buttons are on the side. My kids seem to hit them and release the bottom half into their drinks at least once a week.It finally died--after 3 months of 10-15 uses a day. But--I'm replacing with a different model."
5,Possibly the most apt soundtrack ever made.,"Without doubt a 5 star recording. The movie may not work so well without the assistance of Cooder, but this soundtrack stands well on it's own merit. To get the most of this music you should see the movie, if only to capture the mood intended, and of course to appreciate the hypnotic dialogue in 'I Know These People'."
2,Waste of money,"We all blunder into an ill-informed blind buy now and again. I confess that this was mine for 2001.The film was an exceptional piece of work and so, by and large, is Cooder's music. The recording quality is superb too. Pity it includes a huge swack of film dialogue, and too little music (less than 26 minutes total when you subtract the 8:38 dialogue track, less than you'd have got with an LP in days of yore).Cooder's music is wonderfully dusty and melancholy, and even given the reiteration of a couple of main themes, well worth hearing. I find the only way to even tolerate the CD is to program it to skip track 9 and Harry Dean Stanton's blather."
3,A suspicious book.,"In the opening chapters of his book author,Stanton Friedman, represents his case for a government conspiracy and UFO's very well. But when he relates the story of how he attained his plethora of information, in my eyes his credibility is completely eliminitated. Friedman, psuedoscience writer Bill Moore, and a no-name film producer Jamie Shandera got their information from a roll of film dropped off at Shandera's home. Either Friedman is a mis-informationist or has been duped by a professional con artist. The probability of his story being true seems unlikely to me."
4,a convincing argument for the existence of little green men,take a glance at this book as it is an interesting look at martians and flying saucers. i used to not believe in them but now i do. after looking at this book that is.
5,fantastic,"We love this spout guard. It is very thick, sturdy, and has the bonus of pouring soap into the head of the ducky. Our son loves looking at it.One time he jerked his head backwards while playing and bumped his head on it and it did not even bother him.Great to have and so cute."
4,Forget the book!,"This 3rd part doesn't follow ANYTHING from the book, but it is creative and has the same feeling as the other movies. It was fun to continue to see the same people in the same roles again. If you enjoyed the other 2 movies, you'll love this too!"
3,lacking in it's core appeal,"I think that the main attraction to the Anne series (books and films) is the distinct Canadian feel as well as the PEI setting. Both of these are lacking in this film. It seems like whoever made the film just took the famous Anne and Gilbert and plunked them down in the middle of an mystery/adventure film. It does not suit the characters. Anne is about small town friends, homelife, and rambles in the woods. Not searching for her long lost love in the terrors of war torn france while being persued by spies. It just doesn't fit."
3,At least they made another!,"I caught this third Anne movie on T.V. and thought at first it was just some movie with Megan Follows in it, but was very surprised and pleased to discover it was another Anne movie. I own the other two movies and have enjoyed them for many years. Although this movie was a departure from the originals I thought it was still good- any fan of the series should see Anne III. It was disappointing, but they couldve done worse,hey,they did use most of the original cast(they didnt look SO old!), which made me happy. I hope this means more Anne movies will be filmed; ones that are true to the books and show more of the timeless love story and kindred spirits that make the Anne series so wonderful!"
3,A Truly Beautiful Rendition,"I don't find it hard to recommend this to anyone, especially if you love Howard Shore's orchestral pieces and are looking for a new spin on the original. Some call it mediocre, but I call it wonderful. This is good for a Roleplaying soundtrack, and/or for listening to while reading the books. If you purchase this, you won't be dissapointed."
1,Cheap imitation - labeled to fool you!,This isn't even worth $5.00. Everything about the packaging makes one think it is the soundtrack from the movie. Sadly it isn't.
5,The is the best bird guide book I've ever seen or owned!,"I own a few bird books but this is the best and most handy one to identify a bird I'm not familar with. I love the arrows pointing to the areas for quick identification. It shows me what I should be looking for and sure helps when the bird won't stand still. The book is so light, I can have it on hand at all times. I even have it next to me in my own backyard. If you want a book to start out a new hobby of identifying birds, this is the one to get. Then start collecting from there. In fact, I'm considering buying another one for my car for spir-of-the-moment identification away from home and leave one at home for the backyard."
2,Overtaken by the competition!,Great in its day but now far surpassed by the Sibley guides. The females of the species tend to be the tricky ones to identify so in a field guide why oh why hide them behind the males so that the features can't be seen in the plates.A great guide 30 years ago but it is time to move on...
1,Tastes Awful,I don't know if this works or not. I took one sip and it was horrible. Ugggghhh. It says you can mix it with something but no way will I drink it again. Ugggh.
3,This is a though one,"This movie is very creepy and the clown killer is awesome, very creppy and provides the best parts of the film when he actually shows up. But the cover art is rather decieving, it looks amazing but to show a cool graveyard with a clown & Machette full of blood makes people rather dissapointed after seeing this film. Over all a strange film that as the previous reviewer stated is unsure of exactally what it wants to be, if the Clown was in it more and had more scary parts like he was limited to this film would have gotten 5 stars."
3,Advice & Consent,"Albeit very topical and relevant to the meat of the cold war I found the structure and order of presentation a great help in getting through this longish and often boring novel. It touched on many elements of the Senates' procedural business and that was good but the conflict seemed too much of a soap opera to carry the weight that is the serious business of the legislative branch of the United States. Further, the ""tipping point"" of the conflict (homosexuality) may have been ""shocking"" enough for the era but I had a hard time as a heterosexual being drawn in."
3,Not the typical Clubbers Guide I'm Used To...,"Especially when comparing this CD to the CB to 1999 or Ibiza V2, this CD doesn't even compare. Although, the style and mood is definitely similar, its just a lot borrowed from last year and not enough new head-turnin tunes that MOS is known for. Sorry, but it isn't one of my favs. Galaxy Mix and CB to Ibiza V2 & 1999 are my 3 top favs."
3,Mainstream Alternative,"There's no doubt that this is an unusually eclectic mix of artists, skipping blithely across some three decades of alternative music. Outside of the fact that it's all a rather generic sampling of alternative oldies-but-goodies artists, there really isn't much of a cohesion or theme to the album. Do the Talking Heads really qualify as cult rockers, given the top-10 successes of some of their later releases? Aren't the Smiths a little more mainstream than rebellious? And how exactly did a `60s garage band like the Seeds end up here? There's really nothing wrong with this album; a rather good introduction to ""college radio"" music of the mostly-`80s for the uninitiated. For those in the know, there's probably not much here they haven't heard quite a few times before."
1,Annoying,"I wanted to like this book, I mean, disasters in my state - cool! But, this book demonstrates the worst problems with children's books. It's written without details to keep from boring the little tikes, it's repetitive, it's poorly organized, and worst of all it the author kept taking nouns and placing little graphics between each letter! An example might be ""a&m;&p;&e;&r;&s;&a;&n;&d.;"" Well, let's face it, it doesn't take too many of those before your eyes begin to hurt - it just makes reading the book too much work.No, this is not a good book, it could have been but it's not. I recommend AGAINST this book. (Or should I say b*o*o*k?)"
1,Garbage,"Wish I read these reviews before I bought from ACE hardware.... just installed in yesterday, and already I hate it. It has gone off 4 times with it's obnoxious ""testing"" voice, for no reason at all. I thought it was the remote control (stupid feature anyway) but even when we weren't watching TV it goes off. Who knows, I guarantee it will end up in tiny pieces within the week. What a horrible product and a waste of money."
1,IT TESTS ITSELF IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT!!,"There should be a class action lawsuit. 85db self-testing at 1am and other random times of day simply trains owners to ignore this piece of garbage until they finally throw it away. Which is what I'll be doing tonight. So I'm out $60. If I were like First Alert, I'd have no hesitation to go ahead and sell this horrible thing to someone else.But some of us have morals and don't like waking people up with scary false alarms at 1am."
1,The bane of my existence,"I had no idea this thing had an infrared ""feature"" until today, when I went to turn on Blue's Clues for my little boy to watch. Instead of finding paw prints, I found myself having a friggin' heart attack. The unit was on a table in the bedroom, instead of its usual place in the hallway, cause it's been randomly going off when I turn the shower on. Every time it's gone off, I've been too busy scooping up baby and cat to understand anything other than ""WARNING! EVACUATE!"", but the alarm shuts up after about a minute, so it must not be serious. Or maybe it just assumes that I've died already."
1,AHHHH I HATE IT!!!,"Seriously, this a terrible product. Sure, it may save your life on the ONE instance that it goes off when something is really wrong but you'll probably bash it to smitherines long before then after you hurt yourself trying to get out of a non burning, non gas filled home because the stupid thing is running one of its random ""tests."" You should buy this only if you hate your neighbors and/or love the adrenaline rush that comes with an alarm screaming at you."
1,Never had the pleasure of being able to use it,"I keep putting fresh batteries in it, 5 minutes later it alerts me the batteries are low and that I should replace them. After 3 sets I gave up."
1,I am ready to smash this thing,"We bought a few of these for the house and positioned them in different hallway areas, one being right outside our 3-year old son's room. For some strange reason, First Alert included a feature in which the volume button on any TV remote will set off a test on the unit. The unit is so loud both beeping and voice which would be great if there was a fire or carbon monoxide leak. The issue is we watch TV at night in a living room outside his room and every time you go to turn it up or down, this alarm goes off and wakes him up. I have no idea why they put this feature in. Plus the infrared receiver on this thing must be the best quality one known to man as somehow it picks up the remote from distances that the TV won't even pick it up and it seems to go through walls sometimes. I am done with this unit."
1,Model SC07,"First Alert SC07 smoke/CO2 detector nearly gave me a heart attack when out of nowhere it began to ""test"" itself 1 day after I installed it and randomly since. I had to refrain myself from beating it to death with a baseball bat. I can see no use in a device that randomly spits out 150db of beeping and what sounds like a kid screaming to evacuate the premises. In fact I'm surprised First Alert hasn't been sued for causing heart failure and hearing loss. This toy is useless as a real detector. I am returning to Loews who for some reason only carried this one brand."
1,"Add it to the list of ""Wasted Potential""","I really wanted to like this product. Voice alerts, combination smoke/CO detector, IR testing feature, AA battery operated, what's not to like? Unfortunately, as has been explained already by many other owner reviews, the fatal design flaws of this product make it not worth your money, hassle, or time. Stay as far away as possible from this product!"
1,Terrible,"Awful CD. It was full of corny, cheap, mindless pseudo-love songs. Oh L'amour at least had nostalgic significance and kept me from throwing this CD out after one listen.Update: I burned Oh L'amour onto a compilation CD, so now I can use this CD for its most useful purpose: a coaster."
5,Rock-A-Billy Dwight,"Classic this is a great album! What more can be said.The Mean Eyed CatThe Rock-A-Billy ReviewKNON 89.3 RadioDallas, Texas"
5,This is good stuff,Sticks and stays stuck. The longer it is on the better it stays. A little pricey but not bad for a quality product. I would order it again.
4,Quality product,Worked well to glue trim back to the car. I made the fix about 2 months ago and it is still working like a charm. Only didn't give 5 stars because the trim was bent out and the tape wasn't quite good enough to keep the trim from bending out a mm or so. Excellent price for what you get though.
3,No 'Walking with dinosaurs',"Yes, the CGI is more advanced and at times impressive, but also sterile and unengaging. Unfortunately, the narrative structure of the original BBC series 'Walking with dinosaurs' has been abandoned in favour of a succession of random facts and scenes. Combined with surroundings that are now completely digital, it just doesn't feel like you're there any more. It's not Walking With Dinosaurs, it's Watching Clips Of Dinosaurs.Next time, bring back story arc, emotional involvement, actual backdrops, Kenneth Brannagh and composer Benjamin Bartlett."
5,Great basting spray,This is a great product for making things move a little quicker when quilting.I find it to be very useful in many capacities. Now if I could just get it off of the floor...stick...stick...stick....
4,Practical Dictionary,"This is one of the better Spanish-English (and English-Spanish) dictionaries around. The book is concise, plain, useable, and portable. I like that it provides valuable information on verb conjugations, spellings, irregular verbs, etc. It also includes a list of common idioms and some information on the differences between the language between nations. A weakness for some readers is the smallness of the print - hardly unusual for translation dictionaries that fit into your pants pocket. Still, overall, this is a decent choice."
3,Rengoku is an awsome game depending on who you are,"Rengoku is about a robot trying to get to the top of a tower. On each level of the tower you enter a map wit rooms containing enemies. after you reach the rooms (there are very few in each level) a warp is opened to the next level containing a boss. The game repeats with a new level them boss and so on. The maps aren't repetitive and in the begining the game is a little hard. But as you progress through the levels you aquire more weapons which make the game easier.Rengoku is a great game about strategy and weapons with great controls. the controls are the controls that you would figure you might use, nothing more nothing less.Personally i think it was a great game but kids under the age of 12 might find it difficult and abandom the game. So don't get if for kids under that age. I hope I helped you."
1,What a let down..instant trade in...stay away,"Ok here it is, I was anticipating this game b/c the description was very cool but unfortunatly that is all thats cool about it. First off you have to use the D- pad to control your character when the joystick would have been alot easier to use. The controls are horrible. From the first screen there were lost pixels and glitches. All the rooms look exactly alike except there might be a few more crates in one then the other. Anyways you cant save whenever you want and if you die you lose all your weapons that you picked up so you have to fight hand to whatever weapon your enemy has wich is very unfair. Anyways long story short...DO NOT BUY THIS GAME... I did and am going to get pissed when I go back to trade it in when all they will give me is 10 bucks after I wasted 40 on it."
5,Great For Cosplay,"If you're looking to use this for cosplay, I definitely recommend it.I used it to cosplay a homestuck troll in May and it held up very well despite the heat. Sealing it isn't necessary as it's water based, but it will make it last longer. Ben Nye is good, but it's so oily and you have to powder and seal it every day.Overall, I think this is the best paint for conventions."
4,Couldn't put it down,"I enjoyed this book very much, it had romance, intrigue and danger which makes for a really good read. This is the first book I have read by Mr. Higgins but it won't be my last."
5,Excellent!,"This is one of the best thrillers I've ever read. Fast-paced, well-written, exciting. The characters are alive, the story is perfectly woven. Read it if you want a good thriller!"
3,Solo,"This book was well written. Kept me on the edge of my seat. The hero, Asa Morgan, would be great in a series of mystery novel!"
4,solo review,very entertaining and still relevant after all these years character development is what makes higgins books stand out and this one doesnt miss
2,so-so,Could have been a decent read with a little more detail and a more complete story line. Just mediocre at best.
2,A third rate copy,"I guess Jack Higgins was a one hit wonder. I liked 'The Eagle has Landed"" but 'Solo' is just poor ( or as they say in Texas, 'sorry'). Read 'The Day of the Jackal' instead, it is the same plot but much more interesting.James K"
2,weak effort by Diana,"Diana Krall has a less than classic voice but it works for her. What doesn't work for her are the musical results of anything associated with Elvis Costello. She has recorded many excellent songs, but I am really and objectively angry that she wasted her time with Costello--maybe her love for him trumped her judgment."
5,Very cute series,"The Jenny books are great. I read them all to my younger son, who is ""into"" cats. The stories are charming and well-written, with realistic portrayals of various cats' personalities and New York city life from a bygone era."
1,cute but doesn't work,The clock is cute and priced very reasonable. The only problem is it does not keep time. The shipping is almost as much as the clock so returning it would be more than the price of the clock.
2,Confusing and poorly organized,"The content of the book is generally good. However, without some sort of audio examples of the techniques shown in the book, you will be unable to recreate the riffs -- unless you are already familiar with them, in which case why would you buy this book?If you are thinking the included CD will somehow be relevant and match the content of the book, think again. It is an hour of of 16-bar blues continuously looped with Jon Gindick giving words of encouragement over the top of the music.I recommend instead going out and purchasing some Sonny Boy Williamson albums and skip this book."
3,Three For Three,"Having wrapped up the trilogy, I think I would have been served reading them years apart on summer holidays rather than in one push. That said, still a good bit of mostly innocent fun even though it lacked the slightly darker tone that made The Finer Points of Sausage Dogs so much fun. I'll check out his more famous series sometime, but will probably give it a year or two to cleanse my palate."
4,A Lot Happens Quickly,"This is the third in the German Professor series by Alexander McCall Smith.As in all the other books in the series, the Professor gets into all sorts of mischief, including here a revolution in Colombia. This one is different in that the Professor decides to do the nice thing more than he has been known to do in the past.A lot happened in this book in only about 100 pages. Might leave you a little exhausted.I wonder if there will be a fourth book?"
3,Charming but not engaging,"Fun, simple read but not enough to make me want to read more of this series. I was never really sure what the point was and yes there is some satire to be found, but maybe just too subtle for my taste."
4,Bravo for von Igelfeld and friends!,"Another fabulous frenetic story of von Igelfeld and his pals. Once again, McCall Smith astounds with the ability to put someone so staid in such unusual circumstances, and make him stay true to character. Bravo!"
4,Beware-Not a Series for All Tastes,"Like many readers, I came to the Portuguese Irregular Verbs series through Alexander McCall Smith's charming ""Number One Ladies Detective Agency"" series. Right off the bat, beware that this series has nothing in common with his beloved detective novels set in modern day Botswana. It is hard to believe that he wrote too such different types of books.The Portuguese Irregular Verb series of which ""At the Villa Reduced Circumstances"" is just one book can best be described as a droll send up on the absurdities of academic life. McCall's style can best be described as extremely dry and verging on the absurdist. This type of subtle humor is not for everyone.The books in the series do not need to be read in order. I would recommend that you start with ""The Finer Points of Sausage Dogs"", the best book in the series. If you like this type of humor gone onto the other two books. If you like your humor dry and way over the top, this is the series for you."
4,It's racing without the ridges,"This is the first game I bought for the PSP and it's a great one. It really shows off the power of the system, the sound is incredible, the graphics jaw dropping, and it's immensely playable.One minor gripe though is that the basic tour is waaaaaay too easy. Your car easily outpaces anything else on the track and finishing in first place, a mile up the road from the competition in all 30-odd races is no problem at all. Knowing you're going to win every race and spending every lap out in front on your own gets a bit tedious. The Pro section is a bit better however - although could still be a bit harder to get that podium finish! The controls are nicely customisable and intuitive and the cars have suitably different handling characteristics to make the game challenging.But overall a great PSP game - really playable and a huge 'wow' factor from all my mates - well impressed ;-)"
5,very fun game,I got this game yesterday and it's very fun.The controls are ausome and the graphics are the best. Get this game.
4,Got PSP? Get Ridge Racer,"If you have a PSP then this is one of the few games from the current crop that are worth buying. The graphics are decent (better than DS graphics) and the gameplay is smooth unlike the DS version.The game is pretty easy to slide into and as your comfort zone increases, the difficulty also increases...after about 5 hours you will be winning races still BUT some of them will be down to the last 100 meters...Nitrous usage will make or break your race...The hardest part of this game is avoiding opponents while making turns...they get in the way, slow you down and the bump gives them a boost...AVOID them!What will win a race for you is effective management of nitrous and the ability to fill up those bottles quickly without losing straight line speed...GREAT game!"
2,Too Many disreputable characters for one story,"The message was clear about all the ugly Americans running around like insensitive idiots in Europe; nevertheless, all Americans are not like that. I find it implausible that a glamorous person like Amelia Jackson would get involved with such a shady character and then actually allow him to weazle his way into living in her villa! What a lowlife. The East Somarian kidnapping plan was completely ridiculous. But the one saving grace of the story is the wild and funny wedding banquet. Actually, the only interesting character in the story was the filmmaker Elliot Simon, but he wasn't developed enough.Ladyfingers, to me, was a very strange story."
3,"A so-so, book full of unresolved issues!","Ladyfingers is an interesting story about life on the French Riviera, but there are several things that concern me about the story. First, the author cannot blame Puerto Ricans for what the East Somarians are doing. It's a travesty!Secondly, I am not sure, whether the author is implying that Jean-Claude is actually responsible for the deaths of the tiger and the two trapeze artists. Thirdly, I find it entirely implausible that Amelia Jackson would date a man for six months whose business card only has his name and cell phone number on it.And finally, why would Elliot, the filmmaker, marry someone that no one had ever met? There are too many holes in the story for me, but the scenes of the South of France are pleasant and well described. It make you want to vacation there."
3,"Funny story, ridiculous people!","It is apparent that the author agrees with the theory shared by many of us non-Americans, which is that even an idiot can have money in America. The main characters in the story are simply some white trash women from the States who wander around aimlessly in France, insulting everyone, including their own contrymen. The only intelligent women in the tale are the two friends Amelia Jackson and Desiree Simon, both who are hard working women in exile in France, apparently trying to escape the very characters they meet up with on the French Riviera.The wedding banquet at the Negresco was quite amusing. Personally, I feel that the story would have been more successful if it had less characters. I think that the transexual characters were superfluous. Nevertheless, it was an enjoyable read."
4,"Darkness, you been told!","I'm not a rabid Laymon fan, but his books are usually a good bet for a fun spooky read. Still, a couple of his novel's have muddled endings. Laymon claimed to write without an outline, and sometimes it showed.But not this one.DARKNESS, TELL US is a read that I finished in a sitting. A rollercoaster ride through a house of horrors constructed by axe murdering architects and chainsaw wielding carpenters. It gets deeper and murkier as it goes. There's a bit of the supernatural, in the form of the Ouija board and Butler. Laymon often steers away from this side of things, being kind of finicky about ghosts and the like, but this one has its share. A fun read. I passed it onto my wife, Belinda, which is always a sign of my approval. Buy it. I did, and I didn't regret it."
2,Bad for Laymon,"Boring. Thats the only way to discripe this awful novel. Boring. It started alright, with six kids and a teacher contacting the dead with an ouiji board. A quest for treasure, alone in the woods. Sounds creepy, right?Wrong. I have never been so bored with a horror novel. The villans were awful, the dialog second rate, and no suspense. The usual Laymon trademarks were a little shallow.The Travling Vampire Show was creepy and great. Island was a funny blast. In The Dark was chock full of suspense. Pass this one up."
4,Laymon Gives Us another Reason to Miss Him,"Wow. Once again, I found myself out of breath when I finished a Laymon novel. Darkness began a bit on the slow side, but like a true horror novel took me under its spell slowly & before I knew it was riding along with the characters til the wild end.What starts out as a seemingly simple tale of college students, the occult, and psychopaths soon twist and turn into something much more complex, but not so as to take away from the great pace Laymon sets for the reader.The characters are likeable, grow with the turn of events, and even the oddest plot twists worked because of them.I've gone out of my way to find most of his books - this is a good one to start with, but don't stop here!"
2,unfortunately I expected better,"The quality of the actual characters was a little rough, I expected better. The film in total was very short, about I was actually glad when it came to an end. I guess I expected a disney quality film. There are Scriptures every 3-5 minutes or so and I had to read them outloud for my 3 year old to understand, she kept asking ""is it finished?"" she assumed they were the ending credits each time. Overall I would not have purchased this film."
3,Passion,We had this for our young grandchildren. They enjoyed it but was a little too long for their attention span
2,Great first Half,"He had me enthralled until halfway, and then abruptly changed point of view. After that it was downhill. The sexual fantasies I could have done without as well, ho hum. It started as an action thriller and finished as a family secret outage."
5,Only takes three words to describe this...,Dee - Lish - Us!!!Great tasting and a more healthy alternative to other caramel coated popped corn treats.
1,NO GOOD,"Bracelet broke when putting on the first time, the leather came off the middle silver part. Bracelet does not look like its worth more then 20 bucks."
5,Good Decision,I though it would be a good idea to purchase a learn how to book to help my son pick up on some techniques . This book turned out to be another good purchase . It's easy to follow and understand . Thank You !!!!
3,Needs tuning,This book is good but for starting out it needs some tuning. If you have some knowledge of guitars then this for you.
1,No CD in my copy,"Not written by a left handed guitarist, and generally not very informative. One reviewer reports a CD accompanies the book. I bought mine new, and it did not have a CD. I wouldn't recommend this book."
5,Fantastic item.,This vacuum is fantastic. It has so much power it can pick up anything that would be in your car. The long hose is great if you need to vacuum outside of your garage. I can't think of anything wrong with this item.
5,Great vac for the garage!,I love this vac. It's very sturdy and fits nice with my storage cabinets and work bench. I have it mounted towards the front of the garage and can clean out our cars in the driveway without any problems as well as reach every corner of the over-sized single car garage. Suction is plenty sufficient for standard shop cleaning...I never expected to pick up boulders or 2X4 lumber. I'm glad I picked this over the other options. And it got here SUPER fast as well!
5,Best Vacuum for my shop,This thing works great and looks very good in you work shop. I got sick of dragging around my shop vac. This hangs on the wall out of the way.You should buy one!!
1,sorry I bought one,"I bought one of these a while back and was unhappy with it for the following reasons;extremely loudmotor ran very hotin removing the filter element dust and debris flew all over the place.....When it fell over recently, the motor shrieked and smelled like it was burning(wasn't much of a fall either)upon inspection I found that the rotor was shorting out against the stator because the form used to hold the assembly together was all plastic, so a simple fall of the vacuum snapped the mounting points for the screws.....sorry, but when you're running that much current through a motor it should be able to sustain a small impact. Thumbs down, hoover."
1,Hoover L2310 GUV 10 Amp 5-Gallon Garage Utility Vacuum,"Purchased the product which was highly rated, looks good, mounts easily.All of the high rating gave me nothing but a dissapointment.NOT ENOUGHG POWER, PERIOD. A SHEER WASTE OF MONEY.CLOGS TOO QUICKLY, AND THAT'S THE FIRST TIME I USED IT. NOT A HAPPY CAMPER.ANTHONY, BURLINGTON, MASSACHUSETTS."
4,Super Power & Super Quiet!,"What a POWERFUL product and SUPER quiet! Only wish it was a 'wet' vac too, that is the only negative with this product!"
4,strong performer,We purchased this when our central vac of almost 20 years stopped working. It was easy to install and works well for our needs which include vacuuming out our cars and keeping our carpeted garage clean.
5,Fabulous -- best $$ I've spent,This vacuum is fabulous. I just remodeled my garage and installed a new floor. This performs way better than I expected. A great value. The hose lets me clean the laundry room too!
2,JUNK UNIT,Had this Vac for about 2 years. Ran it very little. Just died on me today. Motor burned up. Stay clear of this one
4,I Need Some Help,"I have had the Hoover GUV for at least six months and am pretty pleased with it. It keeps my garage clean and also does a good job on my car. I recently had some work done in my house, and it was necessary to clean up sheetrock dust. The vacuum did a good job, but then I needed to clean the filter as it was clogged with sheetrock dust. I got the filter out and cleaned it (a very messy job) but now I need help getting the filter back IN! I have tried and tried but it won't go back up the way it was. Can anyone help me out with this? There must be some trick to it that I have't discovered."
4,We use a bunch,"We use in a commercial application, used at least 10 times a day in a quick lube. We get about 9 months out of one, so would last a lifetime for a consumer."
5,ViViD,"First the book opens with a great chapter about observation. Then it goes into the different senses, and shows how they relate to emotions and feelings. It gets into a lot of great mechanics of writing. If someone doesn't get something and most likely a lot of something out of this book...well let's just say I'd be shocked. This did so much for my writing. It's fast paced, no nonsense and great!"
5,Great cable,Needed a longer cable for my older Macbook Pro to convert from DVI to HDMI. Works great no issues. Excellent quality product.
1,Dead on Arrival,Bought this to replace a shorter cable of the same type. But it did not work. No signal was getting from my Mac Mini to my TV.Zero Stars!
1,Does not work for my application,"I was hoping to use this to send a signal from the laptop/PC to my monitor. However, my HP 2311x monitor would not recognize this as an HDMI input. I also tried it on my HDTV and it did not work either."
3,Didn't work for me,"I'm to lazy to return a 15 dollar cable. The price was right. Same with the DSL Modem I bought That ATTnT said was compatible, it wasn't"
1,"NOT 24 PINS, ONLY 18. BUYER BEWARE.",The picture of the item shows a 24 pin DVI cable. I recieved an 18 pin DVI cable. How about a correctly pictured product?
1,defective junk,"Hate defective junk? I do. This cable produced red pixelation on dark images and video. No-Go to the 15ft premium HDMI to DVI cable at step one. So, here is my review - this product gets a zero rating. I don't like junk, nor having to go through the process of returning for a partial refund. Save yourself the hassle and aggravation and don't order it in the first place. By the way - illustrated pin configuration is 24 - wrong-o!, it only had 18. Not sure if that was the cause of the issue, but the image is misleading."
5,Works perfectly at a much better price,"Yeah, it's not fancy, but it is a high quality cable that has worked perfectly for me for over six months and I have noticed no loss of quality or diminished picture. There will always be people that will argue that the more expensive cables will give you better performance, but they are probably just defending their decision to pay much more for a similar product."
3,It is what it is.,"I love Delerium through all it's incarnations, especially Kharma and Poem. Here you have dance remixes of that style music. The music is good, but there is nothing essential here unless you are a rabid fan. The content can get repetitive but that is the nature of the beast.I enjoyed it the few times I listed to it, but I have no great desire to put it in my regular play pile. The standard Delerium LPs get much more play. They could have made this better with a bit more variety, but all in all, it's not bad. Just not great.For something similar, yet infinitely better (in my opinion) get the Sarah McLaughlin Remixed album. THAT gets a lot of play.Look for their new album, Chimera, to be released 6/24/03.Thanks for reading."
3,"Practical item, but arrived damaged","This item looked adequate for its purpose, but it arrived damaged in shipping and I had to return. Looked like it is built for light to medium duty, and it's easy to transport. To sum up, it works, and it's inexpensive. I sent it back to Adorama, but have not received any acknowledgement that they received it (x2.5 weeks), and I'm still waiting. They told me they couldn't sent a replacement, and would refund my payment, but that hasn't happened yet. When all this clears up, I'll probably order a replacement."
2,Ouch.,"Sorry to say I found nothing new, nothing that hasn't been said/written a thousand times before. After listening to these CDs I had the distinct feeling the other reviewers had either been trying to put themselves on the same level as the two authors by endorsing them, a bit of 'fame by association' kind of thing, or it was the very first book/tape on writing they had ever read/listened to. Sure, sure, everyone has their own opinion, but unless you have trouble falling asleep at night, save your money. I wish I had."
1,A Fallen Angel,"For someone who was the most hyped person ever to come out of the U.K., Charlotte Church's performance here had to be one of the worst ever on the small screen. She looked frightened all of the time and looked as if she were reading her lines from a prompter. According to one TV columinst, when she had to be corrected on the screen by Della Reese, that was not in the script but was left there due to time constraints and made to appear to be part of the show. Fortunately, for this episode, they limited Charlotte's screen time to about 1/4 of the show.The episode itself is not too bad and was well written. In any case, this may be the only chance you will ever get to see Charlotte Church on any screen. After failing the screen test for Hermione Granger in the Harry Potter movie, she is reported to be limiting her future entertainment activity to singing. For curiosity seekers only."
2,A Suedo Angel,"I must agree with the many here who conclude that Charlotte Church cannot act. Her inclusion here seems more a charity case or an accomodation to someone in the industry. However, I will disagree with those who feel her inclusion in this program is justified based on her ""angelic"" conduct. Based on my many years of following her, nothing could be further from the truth...Roma Downey saves this show with some brilliant individual acting including being intoxicated. This bit of brilliance will give this episode a saving ** rating, in spite of Charlotte."
3,Great 1950 Pulp Detective Story!,"Cliff Bartells comes back from WWII (the Big War!) to find his little Florida gulf coast city has been taken over by the Mob. Of course, he won't play along and ends up on the outside, that is until a rich tourist is murdered for her jewels and Cliff's company is left holding the bag for a $750,000 insurance claim. Ckiff has to play a dangerous game to recover the jewles, earn a huge bonus and win the woman of his dreams.This was JDM's first published novel (I think) and a good example of the hard boiled detective genre. It's a quick read and well worth finding in the used book store. JDM uses a lot of ideas here that get further development in his Travis McGee novels."
5,Met my expectation,it meet my expectation. the right size for my Treo 650. it fit the handset and i was able to type or press the bottons with the cellsuit on.Good product. i surely recomend it for all Treo 650.
3,decent.,"The chain feels light, compared to others I own. It feels somewhat flimsy. I'd say this is a chain for looks, but I wouldn't want to drop the thing it was attached to."
3,Humorous but Invalid,"After reading through the book there are many comical comments. Many, however, are twisted statistics, un-amusing facts, and some others are just plain out wrong.An example:Jordan says Nero did not burn rome, but in fact was well away from the fire playing the lyre. (Not in the book, but the source of the phrase ""fiddling while Rome burns"" and ""Get me a fiddle"").While Nero did not start the fire, he did not play the lyre during it either. He was out helping to extinguish the fire (read: grabbing a water bucket, filling, tossing, and hoping for the best).Another:Jordan states that not all games the object is to go forwards - that in tug of war, you go backwards.I enjoyed reading it - it definately makes you think about things. Just be careful before quoting them at a party or re-structuring your pitiful existance around them."
5,Helped me change my life,"Thanks Dean for this wonderful book. After reading your book, I finally took some action and have made some major changes to my life. I would recommend this book to anyone who has had trouble ""getting it done"" in the past. Thanks again."
2,very cheaply made,"My grandson enjoyed this item, but I thought it was cheaply made and not worth the money. I would not purchase this item again."
3,"Hey, what's that song?","the sweet one from when she first meets the guy... a chick sings it, but i don't think it's J-Lo. Maybe it's the wedding song, i'm not sure... but it's the first sweet song in the movie. if you know what it's called or who sings it- please e-mail me!"
1,Not what U R looking 4,"Odds are what you are looking for is not this ""soundtrack""! The vocal songs in the movie are not on the ""soundtrack"". One of the songs in the movie is ""Today's The Day"" by Aimee Mann on her CD ""Lost in Space"" released on SuperEgo Records in 2002. Aimee has several CD's out and on the soundtrack ""Magnolia"" nine out of thirteen songs are by Aimee Mann."
5,Highly recommended pocket knife!,"First off, I'm happy that the knife I received from Amazon was an authentic Spyderco - much more than I can say for ordering from eBay. Counterfeits are all over the place on eBay, so do your research and ask for photos.Anyway, this little pocket knife is perfect for me. I use this knife more often than you'd guess, as a stay at home mom. It's great for opening all of my Amazon purchases. ;) The blade is really sharp and the knife fits in my front jeans pocket and isn't bulky. I really like the curved blade and the overall shape of the knife.If you're looking for a present for your lady, I'd highly recommend it."
4,very happy - but could be sharper,"for an all round elegant ""office knife"" I dont think you can beat this. My only gripes are 1) I really expected to arrive sharper and will attempt to sharpen it myself and 2) the way the clip points, you have to rotate the knife 180 degrees after you pull it out of your pocket in order to open it one handed. No biggy, but I would have designed the clip direction differently. It indeed can pass as a bill fold or just clip it in your breast pocket. Looks very smart.As the 4 stars suggest, Im happy and would purchase again if I lost it."
5,Great Value and great product!,I needed a lot of CD's because I like to listen to audio books in the car and some won't play on my iPhone. This was a great value for 100 CD's and I'm glad I bought these.
5,Repeat Order...again!,"I've been partial to Maxell products for well over 30 years--since the days of analog cassettes--UD90s, even before XL-1, XL-2 & MX came onto the scene. The tapes were well-constructed and nearly all are still in my collection enjoying service with no loss in fidelity. I am a discerning audiophile. So far, I have had no problems with any of the CDs I have burned using this product. I will continue to trust the Maxell name for my musical archiving and recording needs. So, since my spindle is getting low, it's time to order again."
1,Maxell CD-R 100 pack,These CD's are junk. We have purchased this same CD in a smaller package and we were satisfied with the product. We have a recording studio and use a professional CD Burner to make copies of our recordings. We threw away every one of these. The ones that did record skipped at some point on 'every' CD. I would not recommend these to anyone they are a waste of money.
2,Disappointing Video,This video was very disappointing. The cover leads you to believe that footage from the Klosters 2000 ski trip is on the video. Which made me believe that footage from all of the Princes outings in 2000 would be included. Their is no new footage from 2000 included. It is a recap of info that was previously put out on a video called Princess Diana's Legacy. Only diffence in this video is the cover.
1,Olympus Adaptor-Great Product,"I have been looking for a way to eliminate costly batteries for my Olympus camera, as I take a lot of pictures of products I sell at home.This adaptor works like a charm! Only wish it had a longer cord (4ft)."
5,Errors have been corrected.,"I was hesitant to purchase the reissues due to all of the reports of pressing errors, but after purchasing Brotherhood at a record store and seeing that it was fine, I went ahead and ordered the others through here. I have all of them now, and I just wanted to let everyone know that they've been fixed. We all know that these are all worth five-stars, no need to elaborate on that. If you haven't bought them yet or had faulty ones that haven't been replaced, it's worth it now."
4,Brilliant image and fantastic customer service.,"I've owned this Westinghouse LCD for less than a year. I bought it because it was the cheapest, but to my surprise it also had an absolutely brilliant picture. Unfortunately, it died three times, possibly due to storms. Oddly, the power supply was fine while the monitor itself was completely dead. I lost my sales recept but Westinghouse honored the one year warranty and paid for shipping after the first incident. Service turnaround has been about 10-14 days."
2,something gave,I own this movie and it remains one of my favorites to this day. I couldn't wait to get the soundtrack but it did disappoint. Many of the songs from the movie are on here but not all. Without Nancy Meyer's wonderful movie in tandem....this soundtrack can just be a lot of noise.
3,Complete List of Songs,For a complete list of the songs in this movie: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337741/soundtrack
3,MAROON 5,I was disappointed to see that Maroon 5 was not included on the CD. They are on the Love Actually soundtrack. Best bet is to buy their CD. Saw them live with summer with John Mayer as an opening act. They are awesome. Their music has been showing up everywhere - check out the ads for the TV show Las Vegas and have also been background to Mon. Night Football plays.
3,missing songs,Terrific movie and great soundtrack. Trouble is a few songs are missing....does anyone know the name of the Paul Simon song from the movie. It's definately NOT on the album.
4,"Great movie, but missing a great song on soundtrack","The movie was great and so is the soundtrack--for the most part. I agree with the people who have posted reviews before me...the soundtrack is missing that great song from the Diane Keaton/Keanu Reeves scene in her kitchen. I hate to post such a question here, but does anyone know what the name of that song is and who sings it? It isn't ""Sunday Morning"" by Maroon 5 as a previous poster suggested. I am sure that it wasn't Jamiroquai, as I did not see it listed in the song credits after the film, but it sounded a lot like him. If anyone can figure it out......please post!"
3,Love the movie; music choice ok,Several of the songs are great...but was surprised that there were so many french songs. I really don't remember those in the movie other than a few scenes in Paris. If you're into french songs..fine..but not entirely my choice.
1,Disappointing follow-up,"This album pales in comparison when measured up against his west coast classic ""Doggystle."" There is one memorable moment in ""Midnight Love,"" but the rest of this aimless disc falls flat."
3,this album is tight,I THINK THAT SNOOP DOES IT AGAIN WITH HIS MELLOW FLOWS AND TIGHT BEATS. ON A SIDE NOTE --- FREE SUGE KNIGHT AND LET DEATH ROW BE REBORN ONCE AGAIN!
5,Snoop Dogg Tha Doggfather,"Everybody hates this album, but I think it's awesome! The beats on Vapors r awesome, and there's other good tracks like Doggather and Up Jump Tha Boogie. This whole album is great, though most people would disagree, I think that this is Snoop's best. If u don't own this, and u want the greatest gangsta rap album in the world, then just pick up Snoop Dogg's Tha Doggfather."
2,Use this for ideas ... only!,"I can say that I am a reasonably competent home chef with an above-average knowledge of technique and most necessary equipment to get the job done. Having said that, I was impressed with the photos of nearly every featured recipe in this book and find the recipes to be admirably aggressive in their taste and texture contrasts. The recipes, however, are nearly all flawed in some significant manner in that following them verbatim will result in poor results. Even when this is not the case, I find these recipes to be ""out of whack"" from a taste perspective by any gastronome's standards and in need of serious tweaking. If you have good kitchen skills and seek to be inspired by the ideas in this book, then I would suggest it (USED!!) ... otherwise, there are much better cookbooks that will yield far superior results. I purchased the Charlie Trotter's Seafood and Dessert cookbooks and came to the same conclusion."
4,Needs a better case.,"As other have stated the tools are grea, and a great value. But the case needs huge improvements. Needs to be made sturdier to hold the tools."
2,Terrible Case - peices fall out all over the place,"I do not suggest that you buy this set. I was expecting a case that would snap each piece into place to securely hold it there when you transport the case. That is not what I got. When I received the item, all of the pieces were all over the place inside the case. So far, I have managed to carry it fairly carefully, and I have not had to re-organize again, but I'm sure the firt time that I forget and pick it up by the handle, all of the pieces will fall out of their spot and I will have to reorganize the case all over again."
2,Extremely disappointing after having used the real EB,"Being an enthusiast of the EB, and already owning a softwareversion and an old paper edition, I was very thrilled by thepossibility of having access to the EB on my pda as well. Nomore would I be left musing about a strange place nameon a book read in the cafe, or wondering what the currency ofa country might be called... It was a disappointment, then,to find that the ""Concise"" in the name of the product is aneuphemism for grossly abbreviated; many articles do little morethan state the obvious about their topic. Moreover, one wonderswhy this needs to be the case, as current SD cards have becomecheap and have enough capacity to contain a lot more text. Isit the desperate need for claiming 900 ""illustrations""?"
1,Baloney with a smile is still just baloney!,"Every 500 years a technology revolution? Henry Ford innovating generation vs. Bob Hope civic-minded generation? What am I, the Kurt Cobain cocaine generation? Give me a break. Dent practically salivates over his own worked-up extrapolations. Poorly written, with some of the most bizarre graphics I have ever seen, this book isn't worth the paper it's printed on. Save you 15 bucks for a couple of e-trades..."
3,Classic case of manipulating data to serve your own purposes,"While Dent has much useful and relevant data, he presents a fair amount of data through his own filters which make it appear they support his conclusions. Someone else could use the same data and arrive at very different conclusions. He may be right on some of his conclusions, and I think he is, but he is certainly no prophet."
5,Excellent Reference Book,"I was recently diagnosed with Lupus. I was relieved to finally have a diagnosis, but I had a LOT of questions. I read it cover to cover. It helped me to differentiate what was part of the disease and what was not. It also helps me to know WHAT to ask when I go to the doctor.I have already used it as a reference since reading it. I highly recommend this for anyone who has been diagnosed or suspects that they have this disease. Or even those who have a loved one with the disease. It really answers a lot of questions."
3,Fall Brawl Wargames 95,Fall brawl 95 had both good and bad.The good was a terrific johnny b badd vs brian pillman match and the first ever meeting between ric flair and arn anderson.The bad was ddp vs renegade and the horrible wargames.
3,Flair vs. Anderson and Pillman's last fling,"Damn, AA is the only person who could make Flair a heel in N. Carolina. I love Flair vs. Anderson and it's the only reason I bought this tape. However, Pillman vs. Badd is also good if you like old-school, drawn out matches."
1,Very disappointed,"I was excited to get this table, as a friend of mine has one and loves it. All the welds broke on the legs, and the screws holding the braces to the table top pulled out. I never even got to use it before it fell apart. Don't waste your money and time on this one! As well, the pad and cover for pressing, literally shredded upon installation."
2,Very Unstable,I bought this table to be able to cut fabric. It is very unstable. It moves every time I touch it and there is no way to secure it. I definitely regret purchasing this table.
4,Good table if you're short on space.,I just purchased this table at Jo Ann Fabrics with a coupon so I ended up paying only $74 and I feel like it is a great table for that price. You can feel a little flex in it so it's not as sturdy as a more substantial permanent table. However I wanted something that would fold down and take up as little amount of space as possible when not in use. I think this is great! It gives a huge cutting space and I have no complaints.
3,dissenting view,"How appropriate is it the cover shows our boy gazing at his navel? Because, for the second outting in a row, Rodney Crowell hands us a ponderous set that's more verbiage than soul. Schooled in the songwriting tradition of Townes Van Zandt and Guy Clark, Crowell used to be a solid practitioner of ""more is less"" when it came to delivering meaning in song. Now, his albums deliver long-winded observations about the human condition, political thought and freedom of expression. His Zen philosophy may deserve kudos -- but it's not ""easy to dance to"" or even pleasurable to listen to. My hunch is five years from now no one will remember these songs. But, plenty of people will still find the power in the simplicity of songs like ""Leaving Louisiana in the Broad Daylight"" or ""Ashes by Now."""
3,Change from 500 mg to 400 mg,"When did they change from 500 mg per capsule to 400 mg per capsule? Would have been nice to know I was taking a different dosage. I took Myomin at max. dosage of 3 capsules 3 times per day with max. dosage of Revivin for 4 months and fibroids reduced in size by about 10% at a cost of almost $1,000. Or were the fibroids reduced because I discontinued using a coffee maker that put hot water in contact with plastic?"
5,EASES THE PAIN/BLOATING,PERIODS LESS PAINFUL WHILE ON THIS MED BALANCES ESTROGEN LEVELS AND MAY HELP EASE FURTHER GROWTH OF INTRAUTERINE FIBROIDS IF YOU HAVE. TAKE 2-3 CAPS XTID. REALLY HELPS EASE MY PAINFUL MENSES
4,A disturbingly good book,"I had to read this book for an English class, but I am thankful I did. It is a good book, and the story moves pretty quickly. You get a sense of playing the roll of the alien, as Juani, is both a Cuban exile in AMerica and Lesbian, both of which make her an oustider of Main Stream American culture. Objeas, did an excellent job letting the reader feel how one might feel if they were a stranger in their native land, and treated as an outsider in their new home as well. A good read..."

5,My two cents,"There are obviously two polarized sides to the issue of how good this game is. I started off in the camp of people saying ""A card-based Metal Gear...wheeeee"". Luckily for me, a friend of mine allowed me to borrow it from him, to experience it for myself (I like to try things before making my mind up about them). As soon as you learn a few basics (nothing in the game told me that another gun with the same caliber ammo counted as ammo for loading purposes), this game becomes incredibly engaging. The strategy aspect brought about by having only 6 of your myriad actions available to you at any time, and those 6 decided by chance, really adds a different intensity to the game. I have played regular MGS games, and this is different, but it's a good different, you just have to be willing to give it a chance. As a side note, essentially this game hasn't left my PSP since it's purchase over a month ago, as it is still fun to play even after I've beaten it more than a few times."
1,warning cheap immatation,"When I got this game I couldnt wait to play it.This game is probably the worst one in the series. The 1st problem was that they talk for about ten minutes before you get to start.The 2nd problem is that the set up is completly different and they make you play it like a card game, and you also have a limited number of moves until the enemy moves. You don't even get to shoot. So if you like the previous games DO NOT BUY THIS GAME"
1,How is it possible?,"It's a shame that the Kindle version (on mac) doesn't display any figure, any graphic. How is it possible to release a geometry book without any graphic..."
4,no complaints. it works.,"No complaints. It's a battery tester. It's cheap, and cheaply made, but it works. Cant tell if the battery is good or bad use this and it will tell you... green = good red = bad yellow = not so good How much simpler can you get.?"
3,"Great Product,Poor Packaging",The price was right the name LIPTON was great but the packaging of this item was a big disappointment as most of the tea bags were damaged and not usable. Hopefully the shipper will improve their boxes so that the bags arrive in one shape....good shape.
2,dont really need it,I took of the head unit of the factory stereo and put in the wireharness but did not function so its no use I just clliped all the wires and found wich were speakers and the rest.
2,"Interesting idea, poorly written","This book was a required read for A. K. Pyatt's Feminine Mythology class when I attended Western Wyoming Community College. I figures this was the only way to get book sales, and after reading it I stand by this assumption. Especially seeing how many of these reviews are written by people from Rock Springs and Green River, Wyoming. Although I thought the idea for this book was interesting, it was very poorly written. The sex scenes which probably aimed at being controversial were laughable soft-core porn scenes which some high schoolers I know could have written better. She should have had some one who was not a friend edit her work before publishing."
5,Great Bonus Tracks,"As every DM fan knows, Black Celebration is a catharsis! Definetely one of the best DM Albums. This one contains bonus tracks, that can also be found on the BC single. Breathing in fumes is kind of a ""Stripped"" remix, and Black Day is an extract from Black Celebration, it is also like a remix of the song, only slower and only with the lyrics: ""to celebrate the fact, that we've seen the back of another black day"". If you don't have the single (or the original CD), this is definetely a way to have 2 on 1"
4,A bleak beauty!,"I still remember being completely entranced by this album when I was in high school. And when the mood hits, it's still the perfect CD for a late, lonely night. The synths, though dated and perhaps even unsophisticated by today's standards, are still incredible. The songs resonate with cold, digital beauty. The message of the songs seems to be that life is meaningless, and the only comfort to be found is in the warmth of a lover's embrace. This is most poignantly felt in ""Here is the House"" and ""But Not Tonight,"" two of Depeche Mode's finest songs. And ""Black Celebration"" and ""Stripped"" are chill-inducing classics in their own right. This is 80's synth-mope-rock at its finest."
5,Catch 22: 2nd only to Slapstick.,"I'm sorry, but Slapstick is my favorite band of all time. Catch 22 is definitely a close second though, and the reason is because of this CD. Keasbey Nights is just...too...I dunno, there's not a lot of energy in it. The singer's great, but the band's just...there. This CD remedies this though. The songs have much more Oomph in them, even with the new singer. Apparently, the singer quit, and now the horn players take turns singing the parts. This is by far the best Catch 22 CD out there. I had to give up a chance to see them live at the SF Pound, but my friends assure me that it was an excellent show. BUY THIS CD!!!"
4,Rock Critics Are Self-Important Jerk Wads,"I'll Keep it short. I downloaded a couple of Tracks from this album and a few other O.C. records and really dug this one. Maybe it is not a perfect carbon copy of the era from which it was inspired, but who cares. It rocks and has cool psychedelic imagery. In addition, this album seems more sonically adventurous than the others I sampled. Rock out..."
4,Nevermind the movie.,"The reason why this was one of Prince's more underrated CDs is becasue (almost) everyone think 'Under the Cherry Moon' ... To me, it was alright. But never under estimate Parade because of that movie. This is a fun CD to listen to, not the best, but worth listening to. I like the catchy drums in 'Life would be so nice' and ""Christopher Tracy's parade"". I also liked Girl and Boys and I Wonder U. And I'll never forget about Mountain and Anotherloverholenyohead, my favorite two songs on the CD. Casual Prince fans should at least have this album, right?"
5,under the cherry moon reponse,"Im very familiar with the Artist when he was Prince,I have all of his works& rare productions,Madhouse series the The Time,Apoloinia,Vanity,The Family,etc.You get the idea this copulation Under the Cherry Moon was one of his most creative ventures ahead of his time,during that time,one of his best ever,I encourage all that dont know to become familair with the talent of Prince,nobody has the talent he possesseses................Andra Wise......"
4,Heramos 8 hermanos,All I can say about this album is that it is a great project of sounds blended and mixed beautifully into quite an original finish.
3,"Not as funny as ""I Love Lucy""","It was okay, and I'm pretty sure this is the episode where Lucy get's drafted into the marines.Lucy was working late with her boss, and she gets this notice from the military that she's been drafted, but it wasn't really her, it was supposed to be a man named ""Lou C."" As it turns out, she has to stay in the military until they can find a way to get her discharged from the army.If you know about that one show called ""Gomer Pyle U.S.M.C."" You'll understand the ending, and why it's so funny."
5,My favorite Van Halen album.,"Ok, so it's not really a Van Halen album--it's better than a Van Halen album. Do not get me wrong: I love the DLR-era Van Halen. During Roth's tenure they cranked out album after album of peerless pop rock, but sometimes the relative seriousness of Eddie and Alex threaten to overwhelm Dave's loony sleaze. You can almost hear the brothers telling him to calm down so they can play their synthesizers. Not so on this disc.On EAT 'EM, Dave reaches his apotheosis. The opening to ""Yankee Rose"" distills Dave's musical persona to its joyous, leering, and strangely wistful essence. He clearly hasn't been taking his pills, and his backing band are the best hired guns in the business. Steve Vai's virtuosic noodling is the perfect complement to Dave: it's excessive, it's masturbatory, and it's frickin AWESOME. But one of the album's saving graces is that the band never upstages the frontman. This is Dave's show, ""and [it] is WILD!"""
1,Crap,Got this as a gift. Picked all the oranges off my tree excited to use our new juicer.It sucked-there isn't enough room under it for a regular size glass. Had to juice into a coffee cup.-isnt big enough to juice a regular sized orange. Have to cut into 1/8ths and carefully juice each piece. Otherwise it leaves a ring of unjuiced orange around the edge. Also juice squirts out the sides.-I hope you like pulp because the holes are so big hunks of peel and pith make it through.- pieces fit together poorly. Cheap construction.It was an inefficient messsy experience. There are better more effective products out there.If you want a decorative retro piece. That's about all this is good for.
4,Very Nice,"A very good overview of how an innovative company should work. Obviously the IDEO recipe is not detailed, but the reader can get some vey good ideas about work-flow, environment, motivation, team working and so on. If you have in mind to start-up, this is the book that can give you some good advices in order to keep the right innovation momentum."
3,"Not bad, but couldn't keep me interested through all of it","This book is packed with tips on how IDEO carries on its creative process, which is interesting, considering the design firm's prestige. The section on brainstorming, for example, I found very useful. However, the book as a whole doesn't quite make it neither as a management book nor as a book aimed at designers. I would say this is the main flaw the author had: trying to cater to two extremely incompatible publics, he looses focus. This made me loose interest in the book halfway through it..."
3,Can all companies become IDEO's ?,"If one company should be able to tell what it takes to be innovative it's IDEO. A very 'readable' book from the masters of innovation. Not a single dull moment reading it. However I must say I ended up being sort of jealous, having read the book. Will this also work for large companies ? Or is it better to set up different units to host these creative people ? This sort of stuff isn't answered by Kelley. A book that looks more into established companies and the process of innovation is for instance Webs of Innovation by Alexander Loudon.Conclusion; an interesting read but not to sure to what extent it's applicable to all sorts of companies."
2,"IDEO may be great, but this book isn't...","Tom Kelley is vastly more impressed with himself and his company than I am. The only reason the book doesn't get one star is because it does contain some useful information. The useful information is about one-fourth of the book, can be found elsewhere, and probably should be. The other three-fourths is endless self-congratulation and pointless anecdotes. Any ideas he presents are given with no real suggestions for implementation. If you have no background (absolutely NONE) in product design or are just curious about IDEO, it might be worth a read. Otherwise, buy something with real content instead of recycled management bromides."
3,Thinking 101,"A good business read - nicely organized with numerous examples of innovation that surround our daily life. Some of these stories begged for more depth and as a result, would likely have been more interesting than the somewhat chatty style of text that filled the rest of the pages."
4,For anyone designing this is a MUST READ!,"I bought this book because the synopsis led me to believe it would be a good read and might help me with my design work. I wasn't disappointed. I read it in one week on my spare time - and I don't like to read that much! The information was clear, well written and made me take a new look at design of everything around me. Of course, that could make me a cynic really quickly as I began to see the flaws in various designs and processes. That's a good thing! I would recommend this to anyone interested in or working in design. It has some interesting stories along the way that help frame (or unframe) your thinking about design. GOOD STUFF!!!"
1,missing clubs,"I never recieved these clubs for christmas. Someone in the wharehouse took them before they were shipped. Even though I was refunded my money, I am still bitterly dissapointed in not recieving my clubs. I cannot afford expensive golf clubs and, after searching for months, finally got a deal in my price range. I doubt that I will ever use your company again. Thank You, Carl Stallman Jr"
5,where?,"I bought this one a while ago and then bought more as gifts because they are great. However, now I can't find them anywhere :( Help me!!"
3,Lair of the Lion,If you are a Chrintine Feehan fan you will enjoy this story that is slightly paranormal. In it the heroine arrives to the lair to find an interesting and secretive man she hope will save her brother. His home and people are surrounded by secrecy and guarded by lions. She becomes part of the legend surrounding him and his people.
5,"nice change from Dark series, but equally satisfying","Having read all of her Dark series (more than once), I found this an interesting change from her Dark and Wild series. Didn't care as much for the Wild series but have read 3 of those and enjoyed. This books had some elements of the Dark series and I can definitely see how her storytelling has progressed since the Lair of the Lion. Would recommend this for anyone who loved the Dark series. It was a fairly quick read and had a satisfying end."
1,Don't buy this book.,"I have read most of Christina Feehans books and enjoyed each of them immensely. This book by far is one of the worst reads I've suffered through in a long time. In fact, I wouldn't have finished the book except I wanted to find out what the malevolent spirit was."
2,Hard to Finish,"I purchased this book even though other reviewers warned me. I like Feehan's Dark Series so much I didn't believe any of her books could be bad. Well, I was wrong. I could barely get past the first 100 pages without skipping over an endless array of boring passages. Then I wound up skipping entire chapters and finally skipping to the end. This is an extremely dull read that moves at a snail's pace with so much angst and pseudo-terror that I could barely stand the story line. Maybe a true lover of dark, gothic tales would like this, but that's not me, so I would recommend skipping this and saving your money for Ms. Feehan's Dark Series which are absolutely great reads and breathtakingly sensuous."
3,An okay read. . .,"Lair of the Lion is worth a read, but it's not up to the usual standards of Christine Feehan. Isabella is a little to headstrong and doesn't always use common sense. I own all the Feehan Dark Series and have read them over and over. Can't wait until Dark Symphony comes out. Hopefully it will be back to the usual ""can't stop reading"" excitement."
2,Boring-Save Your Money,"This book was a big disappointment as well as a waste of time and money. I have read the entire Dark Series which was interesting as well as exciting and very difficult to put down. Lair of the Lion was just the opposite dull, boring and I had to make myself continue to read. There wasn't much chemistry between the main characters and I did not care about them or their problems. Also, the evil presence should have been more fully developed. I hope Ms. Feehan's next book will be written with the flair and style that I have come to love an expect. This book was rated two stars because I finished it."
5,Feehan's best!!,"I know everyone utterly adore's Christine Feehan's Carpathian Saga's, and I am a fan as well, but I think she really shows her true talent in The Scarletti Curse and now this this one.She single-handedly brings Gothics back into fashion with an updated style, giving us the brooding hero, the fearless heroine and all the spooky shadows guaranteed to keep the readers on the edge their seats.The story is basically a beauty and beast redo...the cursed Don Nicolai DeMarco doomed to destroy the woman he marries and Isabella Vernaducci defying everything to save, first her brother, and then the man she loves.Feehan breathes life into the faded Gothics and Faerytales alike and I say MORE MORE MORE!!So fans of the old series Beauty and the Beast - here is a treat for you!!"
2,Lair of the Lion,"I buy my Kindle books based on the publication date. I read so much it is impossible to remember the titles of all the books from over the years. I feel VERY MISLED by the publication date on this book. The publication date is labeled 2012, but it turns out this book is a re-print from a 2002 book. I had already read this book.Not happy at all with Amazon right now. They owe it to their customers to warn us when something is a re-print."

3,Somewhat Disappointed,"Today I received the Ameristep 814 hunting blind and set it up in my living room. Concerning the set-up, it did exactly as advertised and was an extremely easy process. Taking it down took a little more effort and some on-line research, but after a relatively short time, that wasn't a major obstacle either. My only concern is based on the fact that the window screens are held in place by velcro. Unfortunately, the reason I purchased this particular blind was because I believed it used all zippers rather than noisy velcro. Other than that, this appears to be exactly as advertised and I am OK with it (I guess). It will just be necessary that I ensure there isn't any of the game I am hunting anywhere nearby when removing the screens or that noise will cause them to hightail it out of sight. I will update this reveiw after using it in the field."
3,Ameristep 814 Tangle Camo Doghouse Blind,"Does the job but not the ""tuffest"" construction you will find but for the price... not bad!"
4,Oh Yeah!,"This Alien figure is great! It may not have as many joints as the Predator the Hunter figure that's also in MM6 but the articulation makes up for that! The tail is endy, the legs are ball joints, the wrists move, the neck is a ball joint... I also got a Kenner Alien figure but it dosen't come close to this. The articulations go right down to the tiny tendons on the alien's cheeks and detailed ribcage. The only problems are the tail might snap off and the aliens don't exactly fill someone with knowledge"
5,"Finally, an Alien figure ""done right""!","Trust McFarlane to give fans a decent Alien figure. Excellent detail and articulation. Nice and creepy. The ""bendy"" tail is a great touch. Well worth the...price.However, make no mistake-- this is NOT a toy! It's not fragile, but definitely a ""display"" piece.I just wish that the original/classic Alien (H.R. Giger's original design) was available as an individually packaged figure-- instead of part of a ""deluxe"" set."
3,Not used for a toy,I purchased this crown to complete a costume for a children's Christmas play. It was received in a timely fashion. The foam lining made it more comfortable. The closure was difficult to manipulate. It served the purpose and will be used again.
3,Cost-INeffective,"With just over half the tracks of last year's five-star Rhino ""Mascara & Monsters"" CD at about the same price, this collection begs the question : in what way is this CD ""essential""? Even the most rabid AC completists will probably find this one resistable."
2,What you don't know and your boss won't tell you,This book really didn't tell me anything that I didn't already know. Kind of dry.
3,Average At Best!,"I thought No Hiding Place by Maureen Jarvis and Dennis Allen was an average story at best...sorry, I really wanted to like this book more than I did. Based on all the rave reviews I could hardly wait for this book to arrive from Amazon. Don't get me wrong No Hiding Place is a good story just not as great as I was led to believe or hoping it would be. Would I buy another book by this author? Maybe."
4,Outstanding book,"I live in Southern California, and work with and around illegal aliens (or undocumented workers) on a daily basis. This is one of the best works written by an Anglo-American on the subject I have read. Conover took the time to really get to know these people, and not just from an investigative point of view. He worked the fields with these men, lived as they did and currently do, and even took a beating for it. Actually knowing and physically feeling what these migrants do gives him credibility far beyond other reporters/journalists who ask only questions, and feel that they are ""in depth"" after spending a week with their ""subjects"". Conover makes his experience personal, and the reader feels like this is a story told over dinner. The next time you are at the grocery store, after reading this book, you'll have a greater appreciation for the bag of oranges you are buying, and the story behind them."
3,"ARE THEY REALLY ALL ""TOTALLY HITS OF 2002""?","The reason that I bought this CD is that it had the top hits: What's Luv?- Fat Joe F/ Ashanti, What About Us? - Brandy, Oops (OH My) - Tweet F/ Missy, and Wherever You Will Go - The Calling.What I didn't like about this CD is that they had to put songs from 2001: Get The Party Started, Everywhere, A Womans Worth. I thought it said 2002.Another thing why did they put in here, Wrong Impression, We Fit Together, Young'n (Holla Back), and Youth Of The Nation, Anything, in here. News for you, they aren't a totally hit! We fit together didn't chart, Wrong Impression made it to #67, Youth Of The Nation #28, Young'n (Holla Back) #33, and Anything #28.All in all I like it.Piece of advice: PUT HITS IN HERE, DON'T PUT SONGS FROM LAST YEAR, AND KEEP ON NOT PUTTING HERE BSB, AND BRITNEY SPEARS."
5,You won't be disappointed!,This CD surpassed my expectations! It is one of those you can listen to over and over again and still be moved. You can visualize the movie events as the music plays. This is truly one of the best CDs I have ever purchased.
4,get it if you like TRF,"This is one of the older songs from TRF. It is also the ending song to the anime ""Da Da Da"". If you have heard of TRF before and liked their style, you will not be disappointed by this one."
2,Deep Forest Review......,If you have their CD's you don't need this one. The originals are better and not so techno. I did not enjoy this CD at all and I love Deep Forest.
4,needs more,"a good game, alot of fun, but neesds more game variety. there is only two games you can play, colors or animals. its a great time, but the game would go farther if it had more game cards with something else, so you could have more variety."
4,Moments of captivating brilliance....,"Some of the songs on this are better experienced in the film (the version of ""Language is a Virus"" in the film is some of Anderson's grittiest and best work - the version on this disc is over-produced and glossified), but many songs here stand perfectly on their own. ""White Lily"" and ""Radar"" cast beautifully haunting moods (each in less than three minutes!). And the ending of ""Late Show"" gives you chills after even a hundred plays. Not her best album, yet it contains some of her finest, simplest work."
3,"Get it if you are buying the collection, but not a must have","The Princess of Cambodia Barbie doll is pretty, but not as nice as some of the previous princesses. The doll is wearing very plastic looking jewelry, which is kind of ... plastic. I know Barbies wear plastic jewelry, but some of the other dolls look so much better. I think that my favorite Princess in the series thus far would have to be the Princess of Ireland and then, the Princess of China. However, it is a nice collectible and I do think that the doll is pretty."
4,FreeBSD 4.4,"With Apple's adoption of BSD in it's OS/X operating system, BSD is more widely used than unix. Recently, Microsoft put up a site advocating NT/Win 2000 as a platform to use in preference to UNIX, but the site ran on FreeBSD! They quickly pulled the site off the net.This book is an excellent compilation of man pages, with some embellishments. You can't go wrong if you want a rock solid platform for your web server, FreeBSD will fill the bill."
2,Low quality DVD,"While the movie is good, thanks to Yul Brynner, this DVD is very bad. It looks like it was transfered from a worn out VHS tape to DVD. My old VHs version of it plays better than this DVD. The jacket has a few mis spelling names! Yul is Yel and other typos. I am almost sure that it is not released by MGM."
5,Johnny Wolf turns in an excellent performance!,"Johnny Francis Wolf turns in a polished and entertaining performance as GABE, the hapless antihero in this creative, entertaining and visually stunning tongue-in-cheek stab at the/a darker side of Christmas. If they ever remake Rocky Horror, Johnny a shoe-in for BRAD..."
1,The ugliness of Bob Mackie at an expensive price!,"Ewww....Bob Mackie is a terrible designer! Who hired him? His dolls are very ugly, and, oh, so are the clothes!I wouldn't buy another of his dolls as long as i lived!!!"
5,A desert island must!,"Every few months, I make out a Top 15 ""Desert Island"" list of my favorite albums. There are a few who always make the top 10 and this BoDeans release is one of them.Catchy melodies, great lyrics...with not a dull song in the bunch (you know the kind--you skip it on the CD player or leaving it off when you download the album on to your computer.You can't go wrong with this terrific CD. The Strangest Kind is one of my all-time favorite songs!"
5,Hunt This One Down!!!,"I just got this toy and it's great! The Spear is actually six telescoping segments... you could just sit there and make the segments go in and out for like a half hour. The Predator also has a wrist blade that can slide in and out of his armor and a wrist computer padthat can fold in and out. The only problems with this figure is that the spear segments can pop off the rest of the spear, but its easy to fix. I also don't see whats educational about a Predator. But besides that, this figure's awesome!"
5,Only God could improve on this!,"I have thinning hair. Color helps and gives my hair more body and texture and DRYNESS! This system gives my hair a second life! Not only does my hair have more body and shine, but it seems thicker (a true miracle) and doesn't even look dry. Love this stuff!"
1,Nioxin Not Good as it use to be,Nixion product is not good as it used to be. The product is very cheap now. I have seen the owner of the company has been changed on the liable and it is no longer Nixion.
3,Fomula & country of origin have changed,"Not sure why this has happened but my orignial and smaller bottle of Nixon 3 Cleanser (10.0 fl. oz)was made in the U.S.A. while this larger (33.8 fl. oz.) size is made in Mexico.The small bottle's first 5 ingredients: water, tea-lauryl sulfate, sodium laureth sulfate, hydroxypropyltrimonium honey, cocoamido-propyl betaine.Now it is has changed to: water, sodium laureth sulfate, sodium lauryl sulfate, citric acid, sodium citrate.I'm not a chemist but, it certainly appears to be less natural without the tea and coco ingredients.Changes have been made to the formula structure and I'm not sure if it is a better formula or a cost saving measure.I'll give it try to see if it continues to be useful."
2,Knock-Off,"This appears to be a knock-off product. The bottle is different. THE INGREDIENTS ARE DIFFERENT. It feels different on my scalp and it has a much stronger menthol smell than the original Nioxin products that I purchased in a salon. It might work just as well... only time will tell. But either way, this is not the ""real"" Nioxin product."
1,Absolute Nonsense!!,"Clarkson is out of his mind, no serious evangelical leader is talking about a theocracy."
3,"Good Music, But Lacking The Best Cuts","On the positive side, this album contains some very good songs and would make a good ""intro CD"" for someone just getting into the blues. However, the obvious omission of the final guitar duel between Ry Cooder and Steve Vai was too bad. I would suggest picking up Ry Cooders ""Get Rhythm"" CD for a better example of his music. There isn't much available by Steve Vai (""Passion and Warfare"" is pretty good, but not bluesy), and who knows--maybe he and Cooder will get together and re-record the duel! About the best thing that can be said is that Ralph Macchio isn't on this album!"
3,a little disappointed,"After searching for many years I was extremely happy to finally find this soundtrack and found it very enjoyable, however the main reason I ordered the cd was for the final ""guitar dual"" that takes place during the movie's finale. I was very surprised to find that it is not on the soundtrack. It severly lessened my satifaction of this purchase."
3,What the f**K,One of the previous reviewers was going on about real blues and all that but im just guessing people weren't buying a film soundtrack for real blues they were buying it for what you expect to get - music from the film. The complaints arent about the type of music but that fact that a piece music that plays a big part towards the end of the film was missing. If people wanted real blues theyed have ended up buying albums by BB King etc (if they didnt already own a few).
5,Great book!,"Whether you are a novoice or have been practicing TDD, this book is worth reading. It is really well organized, has great examples and explains how to use available TDD tools.Great job, David!"
5,"A very good cd, even though it is a remix cd.","This is M-flo(Mediarite flo)'s remix of their first album, Plannet Shining. Overall, it is a very balanced cd with excellent remixes. M-Flo did a great job of diversifying the remixers, getting the best remixers from all over the world(America, Japan, and France). I especially loved the Quantum Leap Dj Watarai remix(Track 2), but some remixes are not as good as the originals. I also liked the fact that for the remixes, all of the vocals were redone, showing how much M-flo really love their fans.I recommend listening to Planet Shining first before buying this one to get a feel for M-flo, the only downside to the cd is that some of the remixes are old remixes from previous singles."
5,Nikon MB-E5000 battery pack,"Wouldn't leave home without it. No more having to wait to charge the batteries, just pop in fresh ones from the store."
4,Jim,"Perfect earphones for iPod with remote control.I have so many headphones and earphones, thisone sound very good and reasonable price."
2,Not as good as original IPOD phones,"These are well engineered and sound good, but do not improve base over the original IPOD phones. I returned them."
4,Great for the price.,"I picked these up from Amazon for $30, a twenty dollar discount over the fifty dollar price you see in most retail stores. At that price point these are fantastic headphones. The sound is clear, the bass is ample for my taste, and they are actually fairly comfortable to me. I normally do not like in ear headphones at all but I can stand these for an extended period of time. A great addition to an iPod nano."
5,The sound quality is poor!!???????? WHAT!!!,People should abstain from writing reviews when there DRUNK!! or Stoned!!I haveSony MDR-E828LP Fontopia Earbuds with Winding CaseandSony MDR-EX71SLA Fontopia Bud-Style Headphones with Case (Black)andSony MDR-EX90LP Stereo Earphonesand the 71's are by far the best fit and SOUND period!!
5,Excellent,"I mainly use these for listening to audio while I sleep.In the summer I have 2 fans running an these do a good job of blocking the noise so I can hear the music.they don't look high-end but they sound like it!clear highs, even mids, just the right amount of bass in the soundThe now new non-Y-cord design isn't problem depending on what side you place them."
4,Excelent quality for the price,"I bought these for my T-Mobile Wing and they really sound great, there are sounds that I didn't even know where there! Good job Sony!"
3,Good sound quality,"The sound quality is good and, when riding a bike or the subway, these are the smallest, best, outside-noise-excluding headphones I've worn. But Sony just can't figure out the cords! This one comes with an extension, but without it the cord ends at mid-torso: unless you're wearing a Shuffle and don't plan on moving your head, you will need the extension. The extension is of course too long and, being in two parts, is bound to get fouled up. Another disappointment from Sony."
1,Amazon shipped the wrong product,"Disappointed. I ordered with 2-day delivery, the package came on time but inside was the wrong item: I received cheap sony headphones for seven bucks instead of the MDR-71. when I requested to have the correct item overnighted, the answer was that if I place the order today (Thursday 4 PM EST) it will not arrive until Monday! they claimed it was tool late for overnight (at 4 PM... give me a break), and they don't deliver on Saturday. What a joke. That's what you get when you buy online instead of a real store like CC which has unbelievable good service."
2,What's the appeal other than a cat toy?,"I've been constantly seeing these beans at my daughter's toy stores so out of curiosity I decided to buy a pack. My daughter really had no interest in them other than looking at the front of them for a few minutes. After a day or so she left them on the floor for our cats to find and believe it or not, they love them. They go crazy over them!"
1,Why oh Why did they make this?!,"Hi, .... my mom bought these ""THINGS"" for Christmas this year. I thought it was cool and would be fun, but guess again. These things dont even do anything. Unless i'm dumb or sumthing what do these things do? Please tell me! Anyway, why did they waste the plastic, i mean little kids around the world might need plastic for some reason, so why waste the plastic used for ""Mighty beanz"""
4,Collecting Mighty Beanz,"Mighty Beanz are great. They are little collectible plastic beans that you can collect and put in a giant collectors box. You can buy 3 packs and 6 packs and it comes with a guide about Mighty Beanz that will tell you about the secret club greeting, the Mighty Beanz points and the rare Mighty Moose bean. I am 8 years old and I love them and so do my 5 year old sister and 3 year old brother. They can be very fun but be careful not to lose them because they are pretty small."
3,Beans are back in.,"The Mighty Beanz from Spin Masters are a very intresting toy indeed. Each set has six beanz. Each marked with a character print. Some are worth more than others. which makes them perfect for collecters. The actual bean is very sturdy. Holding up to lots of play. Yet the same cannot be said for the character print which is easily scraped and torn away. Yet kids do have quite a time watching them roll and bounce around. Thats not all either they also come with a guide of games to play with them. So it will keep them busy for hours. Yet kids also seem to get bored with them after a week or so. So I am not sure how long this item will last on the market. I would say it is more for collecters than children. Their marked for 5+ but i would say it was more for 7 to 10. Cause a little kid is not going to care if something is collectible or not. They have big plans for this line of products, and this is only the first series. ..."
3,Well my daughter likes them..,"The Mighty Beans have various painted faces of animals, people and er...'things'.. as well as jump around (with a little prompting) by what we assume are repelling magnets inside each one. My daughter loves to collect and trade them and they are all the rage in the neighborhood...HOWEVER, I find them a waste of money..another junky collectible (wouldn't even call these tiny wood things a collectible!) that will soon lose it's popularity and be tossed aside like the Ty Beanie Babies which now sit in a dusty pile in the corner of my children's bedrooms. They are way overpriced considering what they are and what they do, and I detest that the female beans have breasts painted on them. If these are made for children, why on EARTH are there breasts..and even breasts with moles for gosh sakes..painted on these beans?!?!?! I protest the whole idea of these toys but reluctantly admit that my daughter has fun with them. Ugh!"
4,Mighty Beans,"This is a really fun toy.I mean really.You can wrestle 'em,,down- hill race 'em, and trade 'em. But their is kind of a bad thing about it. It doesn't teach little kids a thing, the paint chips off wicked bad, the price of them swallows your wallet whole,and if you don't have the spiecial tracks to them,they're totally meaningless! So despite the bad things, it is not so bad of a toy. When I got my first pack of Mighty Beans,I went scyco over them!!!!"
4,Cigarette Lighter Locations,"The product works fine, but everyone should be aware of where there cigarette lighters are on their cars. I was unable to shift gears when the product was plugged in because my lighter is right below my radio, and my gearshift is in between the 2 seats... so just watch out for that. I had to buy a lighter extender so that the product wouldn't be in my way. It works great though, and the sound is very close to CD quality!!"
2,Very interesting premise but flawed by bias,"The book is well written and the premise is that neocon's (as he defines conservatives) have taken over the military-industrial complex to the detriment of the country would have much more conviction if he kept his snide comments out of the book that clearly shows his liberal bias. If your political leaning is liberal you will read over them and hardly realize they are in the book. But if you are a conservative you will begin to doubt his arguments because of the bias. While he did attend West Point so did Wesley Clark, and I am sure they would agree with each other politically."
3,Hard to understand in parts but okay overall,The author knows what he is talking about however there are parts of the book that you have to re-read because they are hard to understand. Especially if you don't have any military background or aren't familiar with the politics that revolve around the issues of the Vietnam and Gulf Wars.
3,"Good, but doesn't go nearly far enough; and neglects Peak Oil","Bacevich rightly points out that we are in the midst of an ""American Empire,"" military basis and all, and that many Americans are indeed seduced by that. That seduction includes the semantic denial that we could even be an empire, since we're not ruled by an emperor.But, Bacevich, in his prescription for solving this, seems all too willing to settle for ""Empire Lite."" And that's not good. It's like using methodone maintenance for heroin addiction rather than getting off it entirely.No, scratch that. It's like using powder cocaine for crack addiction rather than getting off it entirely.Also, in his analysis of today's highly mechanized American armed forces, and the fact that the locus of empire seems to be the Middle East, it's a huge oversight for Bacevich to not even discuss Peak Oil and its possible imperial ramifications."
4,Makes many valid points about America's desire for war,"This book, although written by a Conservative, gives plenty to think about, by Liberals, Moderates, and Conservatives. Mr. Bacevich lays out the uses and abuses of military power, by the civilian leadership, over the last 20+ years, and does so with skill. He makes many valid points, including, how Congress has abdicated its responsibility, to declare war; based on the notion of supporting the ""commander in chief"" (i.e., The President). He also lays out a course of action that should involve using war as a last resort. He does not say that America shouldn't defend itself, but use war more effectively. While one might not agree with all of his ideas, he provides more thought out strategy (something the previous administration especially did not do, when going to war, and which has partly [partially] led to our current problems.) Worth a look."
2,Flip Flop,"It said it was good for small/medium flip phones, but its an extremely tight fit for my phone. Every time I put it in, it hits the buttons on the side and sets off voice commands, or turns it to speakerphone. It was a waste of my money. My phone is a small Samsung flip."
3,Gets the Job Done,"Initially, when purchasing this item, I thought it was an authentic LG manufactured charger that would be identical to one I was trying to replace. However, when the item arrived, it turned out to be a cheap no-name brand charger made in China. Although I am not happy about being misled by the description and promotion of this item on Amazon's website, the fact is that the charger works fine, and for the price (approximate $10 with shipping) it an excellent value. Try replacing this charger with one from the Verizon store and you will pay $30."
5,Excellent,This book was something I have been looking for for a long time. It answered questions and filled in the blanks for so many aspects of my life.
5,Looking in your window,"I was raised Catholic then converted to Islam in my twenties. My constant search for understanding our purpose in life, was given great insight through this book. It helped me not only to understand my purpose but to see others as the same. I can now see how the people in my life are so important to my growth on my spiritual path. I see people through their eyes, into their souls now."
3,"Completes as a ""Part 2""","A must-read for anyone who absolutely enjoyed the first book, Journey of Souls, which was a fascinating, captivating read. However, as with any sequel to an original which had set such a high bar, I found Destiny of Souls slightly harder to follow-thru past the ""reader's block"" at the midway point. Nevertheless, the delivery of additional, complimentary information on the subject matter is what kept the book ""alive,"" so to speak, and was happy to have pushed myself through the 50% marker (Kindle) to find what I was looking for - or maybe I was just in a mood for a few days, who knows. Overall, a good 4 had it been ""the original,"" but because of composition and style, or content, or my patience being tested, I gave it a 3 for purely personal objectives alone. If you enjoyed Journey of Souls, then I will say 5 to buy this sequel...understanding that it is a sequel, and as sequels go, anyone's guess. If not, then go get Journey of Souls first, and enjoy!"
5,I loved this book too,This is sort of part two of 2 books. You don't have to believe everything you read for a book to offer you something of value. This book is very stimulating and can get you to think twice about many things you do in life and how you view what others do. Like what is really most important in life and in all your relationships with people. And that is the value of reading it [Not trying to prove whether it's true or not]. Read Journey of Souls first. It's written by the same Author. I'd buy both again !!!
2,Not for a Beginner...... Trust Me,I have had lots of how-to guitar books/CDs/Videos over the years. This book is not for a beginner. It quickly skims over the teaching points as though you should know it already. You can do lots better by going to Youtube and checking out the beginning blues lessons there.... Just my $.02 of course.
2,not impressed,I've been playing for six months so when I read the reviews it seemed like this would be a decent place to start looking into the blues. Half the book is easy enough for my twelve year old son and half is way past me. I just wanted to learn some popular riffs and a couple songs but this book can not deliver. Spend your money somewhere else.
1,Seriously?,"I bought this book new because I needed for my biology class, got the book and the book was not even put together correctly. I had to fix about a hundred pages because it was still stitch together."
5,Cracking good read,"It's a long time since I read a book in a day, and it's a long time since I read a novel that made the hairs on my legs stiffen and my skin shiver with fear, but I did with this one.Pat Barker has always appealed as the author of novels of nuance and subtlety but which don't become over-literary in a ""school of creative writing"" way. But she excels herself in this book. It's about lots of things: why people cover wars and what covering wars sometimes does to their minds; about love and loyalty. But it's also a very good yarn. Pat Barker has an old-fashioned and utterly welcome belief in plot and comprehensibility. Double Vision is a very good read - plus a lot more."
1,Dissapointment !,"Just another Marketing book about Excercise and Nutrition. No specific Plans pro bodytype, vague guidelines, a lot of repetitions of known things. It seemed me like a copy - paste from other excersice and nutritional books...My personal recommendation: do not waste your money here ! (This review reflects my personal experience with the book)"
5,Beautiful Enticing voice.,"One of those folks you've never heard of, but are overwhelmed when you discover them. Marina has the voice of an angel and amazing guitar styles. My personal favorite is track #3, ""Con Te Partiro"", however ""La Vie en Rose"" is a close second. Not that I speak eight languages but it seems through her mastery of the various accents that Marina does. Can't recommend this enough."
3,"Good Music, Bad Case","The music is good. The only critique I can give is about the case of the cd. It was so hard to open until we broke the cd case. There was no way of getting it open properly because it's so tight. I guess the plastic got stuck with each other. Otherwise, this could have been the best if the CD case opened properly."
3,Fabulous Fifties: Those Wonderful Years,This CD was good but it doesn't have a lot of songs that I like. I purchased it for a couple of songs that I wanted and had not seen on other CDs. I am satisfied with the CD because if had the songs that I was looking for.
2,Functional but could be better,"The concept of the container is good. The most annoying thing is the small compartment on the top will not stay closed. This makes it mostly useless to store anything in. Also, the main compartment is a little too small and will not hold longer rolls of paper."
3,The book is OK,"This book is OK. It has some good advise and ideas, however when it comes to very important issues, like using music in your videos, it avoids the topic entirely.It doesn't really tell you ""if it's really ok"" to use regular commercial music with your videos. This is important for a business to know. It just says YES and NO and lets you wondering."
4,Surpised!,I was surpised at this movie. I thought it would be more of a girl movie but it wasn't. This movie had action and a love story. It had a good message too. That love is the answer. I really enjoyed this. This movie is rated 13 and up.
5,"Beautiful, masterful anime classic. A Must See","I have never seen Ah! My Goddess before. I borrowed this DVD from a friend, and just watched it this Sunday afternoon. Basically, this is one of the most beautiful anime movies EVER created. It is different from your usual style of anime, but will touch you in a completely different way. The pictures are gorgeous, so were the music and the storyline was top notch. This movie has just become my all time favorite movie ever. Everyone owe themselves 106 mins and see this masterpiece."
5,Amazing graphics and impressive sound,"I saw the VHS and VCD version of this movie before. The DVD is much better than all the versions and formats I have seen before. The wonderful illustration and graphic presentation is breath taking. The color is rich and free of defects on my Proton monitor. The audio is also very well done. I played the movie using a Pass multi-channel amplifier, Elite DVD player, Lexicon sound processor and B&W N803, N805 & HTM1 speakers. The sound is warm with full bottom, not dramatic yet smooth transition between 5 channels and good depth. The voice duping appears to be the same as the VHS tape, OK. The subtitle has mismatch to the voice in a few areas, I turned it off. It would be great if the subtitle is more accurate so I can listen to the original Japanese voice and read the subtitle.I was delighted and highly recommend this DVD to you."
4,Its was good,This movie was good but the serise was better. The people we not the same looking. over all i liked the magic parts of it. this movie expanis more about bell and her sisters. there is more magic used and i like it.
3,Hmmm...,"Well, it's a fairly competent job (Although the copy protection was HORRIBLE for anyone who still uses their VCR to pipe their DVD player to their TV...)...The dubbing, was, as usual, craptastic. Especially the Mini-goddess dub...it was even more pathetic than the half-hearted attempt at the movie voiceover.As for the movie itself, you'll find it's the same old plot used in the manga (about 20 times...)... Keichii gets taken over by a powerful spirit, damn, who saw that coming?Anyway, if you don't have anything else to buy, then yeah, go for it. Otherwise, buy yourself a real movie."
1,The Worst Computer Ever,"I was too poor to pay for an expensive computer and too impatient to wait for a Dell to be delivered, so I bought a Compaq Presario. It was one of the worst choices I've ever made. The computer is slow, slow, slow--and right after the guarantee expired, everything that could go wrong, did. First, my keyboard started having trouble, and one entire line of the keyboard died: so I had no `9,' `o,' `l' or periods.Then the computer stopped charging. First I thought it was the charger, so I got a new one. Nothing. Then I was told it was the battery. I got a new one. Still not working. So now I have a computer that has no power, all my information is stuck in my dead laptop, and I have made a resolution to never, ever, buy any product from Compaq."
4,Need more Beach Boys or Beatles with a touch of The Byrds,"Young and Inspired artists from war torn Isreal find an outlet for their musical inspirtaions (Beach Boys, Beatles, The Byrds) in each of their albums over the last ten years. Their english music is good and the hebrew is even better. If you are a 50 something looking for some good new songs pick up this album, or if you want to just listen to good music instead of noise."
5,Really amazing book,"11 year old reviewer: I really loved this book. It was really entertaining and quite immersive. You could almost feel like you were in the actual book. I really liked the main character a lot, because I could relate to him. I can't wait to get the second one. It was as good as Artemis Fowl which was my very favourite book before this one."
2,Creepy and overrated,"I was so disappointed when I received this book, after seeing all the high reviews it's received. I agree absolutely with the reviewer who said ""Great...if creepy ideas are part of our bedtime routine.""It's possible to dream of creative things without being strange or creepy. But of all the infinite possibilities, this book skipped the fun/creative ideas and went for the really strange ones. The ""Ifs"" in this book are so random...things that no child or human would ever imagine, or want to imagine for that matter. Such a disappointment."
5,Creative and Fun,"I read this book to my daughter's kindergarten class and they loved it. The pictures are wonderful, but the best part is its imagination. It encourages kids to think in new ways and inspires creative thinking (and hopefully an interest in the arts). I enjoyed it and heartily recommend it."
1,Don't bother with this if you want to have a conversation,"I have tried to use this so many times and it just doesn't work. If you have the speaker up loud enough to hear the person on the other end of the phone, the microphone picks up the voice and then cuts out the sound. If all you want to hear is yourself yelling into the phone ""Are you there?!?!"" then this is the product for you."
1,"Good idea, the one I ordered didn't work.",The set up for this hands-free kit is good. You can mount the micropone on the visor and the speaker is out of the way in the cigarette lighter. The problem I had was that I had to shout to be heard and I could barely hear the speaker. There was definately something wrong with the unit. The volume control had no effect. It came with no paperwork or instructions.
5,school teachers as heroes,"this mystery story features four teachers as unlikely heroes in a story that has everything; believable characters, an absorbing story line, and a style that is easy to follow. The book is a real page-turner from beginning to end."
1,"Fast Horses, Dragging Book",I didn't like this book because the story dragged on and the story ended to abruptly. The good thing about this book was the race at the end. I read this book for a class assignment and I really didn't like it. I don't really recommend it for anyone except horse lovers.
1,this book confused me but I'm not the one to ask,"never judge a book by its cover! please!! with its beautiful, detailed cover it turned out to move a fast as the cover looks good(thats pretty fast!)! and it's just all around weird. one minute you're here the next you're there and then you're talking to kubali khan. I could barely keep up with it! and when it was slow (rarley ever) I had no idea what was going on because all the important parts happened when the book was going fast. as I said before this book was very confusing to me."
3,An ok Horse Of Milk White Jade,"I give this book 3 stars. It was an ok book. It was a little slow in some parts because she described everything so thoroughly. It is not as exciting as Harry Potter, but it was exciting in some parts. She had many little adventures that were all tangled in one, which made your heart sometimes skip a beat. I would recommend this book to horse lovers."
4,"Horse, Adventure, Good Book","This book is about a life of a girl who is in search of her own destiny. She is also in search of a horse that can win the big race that will bring good luck to her and her family. Bad luck seems to follow her everywhere, until she learns you can pull your own luck out of the air. Oyuna, her horse and her faithful cat go on many adventures together before they can fulfil there destiny. I liked this book and I recommend it to older kids and adults. It is a very good book!"
3,I Rode A Horse Of Milk White Jade,"I think that this is a a good book. If I hadn't read it in class, I probably wouldn't have picked it up. That would have been a wasted book because it was good. This book is about a girl who leaves her home to search for her dream. This book is based in China and Mongolia so you might like to read it if your studying China or Mongolia. Also, if you like adventure or historical-fiction books, then check it out."
2,"Mongolian Dictionary, please?","This book was annoying. It had alot of Mongolian words that weren't in the mongolian glossary. Some times there were some crutial parts that all of a sudden had a word that wasn't in the back, or that was in the back but didn't make sense were it was put. I reccomend this book if you can speak fluent mongolian."
5,I absolutely love this book!,"I just wanted to write in and say that I bought this book years ago and loved it and I loaned it to my sister. I never got it back. I bought another copy of the book and I eventually loaned it to a friend. She ""conveniently"" lost it too. I think she really just loved it and didn't want to part with it, just like my sister. I am now buying my third copy because I can't bear to be without it either."
3,Useful -- a little expensive,"I like that this will hang over the rim of a teapot or mug when infusing tea, or pot when I'm using it to infuse herbs and spices into a soup or stew (like juniper berries, cardamon seeds, cloves... stuff you don't want in the soup itself). It's a little small in capacity for the latter use, and a little awkward to fill. But it does the job. It's kind of expensive at $20 for such a simple gadget that probably ships from China at $1 each or thereabouts!"
2,"Great concept, but too porous","I love the combined functionality of scooping & steeping all in one. I also like the stick design as opposed to the ubiquitous ball design. However, I disagree with the product description in that the holes are not small enough to handle small leaves. Every cup of tea that I've made ends up with quite a few leaves floating about. Probably works just fine for medium leaves. I gave it two stars because it doesn't perform it's primary job -- infusing -- as good as it needs to be."
3,"Lovely cards, but hard to read","I gave these and the Victorian Cottage set to my mom for Mother's Day. She loved the cards, but had trouble using them. The graphic on the card face as well as the back is rather confusing, especially to a bunch of little old ladies playing bridge. Oh well, better luck next time."
3,A good read.,"This was a fun quick read. A realistic portrayal of an armored battalion. The story was a little far fetched, but the detail of the tactics with realistic characters made up for it."
5,TIN SOLDIERS,"A novel about armored warfare by a writer who knows armor. Michael Farmer talks the talk and walks the walk. He is a tanker and knows the beast. His novel put me right back in the tank, hearing the sounds of the vibrating steel, the whomp of the main gun, the pungent smell of burnt cordite, the sight of enemy armor in the gunsite, the bark of fire commands. It's a book I couldn't put down. I loved every minute of it. God help me but I miss the steel beasts. A retired Tanker."
5,Best buy ever......,"This is really the best spend money ever!!!! Im really happy with my Satin Ice, I cant believe how easy it makes depilation. Im in love with it!!!!!"
2,Not for those in a lot of pain,I think this would be a great video for those who want to strengthen the back or may have back strain ... not for those with ruptured discs .... I was unable to do any of the moves without causing more pain.
1,Disappointed,"I was excited to try this cart. Unfortunately the wheels are held on with bolts that tighten as the cart rolls, bringing it to a dramatic halt! Really annoying and bad design. I missed the return window so now am stuck with a $60 albatross, still shlepping my own bags at the market."
5,Magnificent Chess,Keres' games and notes offer keen insights into the mind of one of the greatest chessplayers in history. They repay careful study.
3,Conversation piece,"A good conversation piece on your coffee table. Give it a look when you want that twinkie, yo yo, or box of chips."
3,Not exactly as pictured,"I am satisfied with what I received, however it is not the same item as in the picture. This one is attached to a white piece of plastic to sit flat. I would have preferred the one pictured. Either way, it's a pound of fat replica and is perfect for show and tell.Thanks!"
1,PURE JUNK REPACKAGED,"Now look at the cover of this DVD...looks pretty creepy...pretty scary...pretty sinister, right? Well take a good long look because it all goes downhill from there. This film was one that used to be show with some frequency on the old ""Up All Night"" on USA with Ronda Shear. Yes, this movie is some 16 years old and is being re-released with the hopes of fooling a few suckers into buying it. It's advertised as being from the co-producers of ""Return of the Swamp Thing"", as if that was supposed to be some kind of ringing endorsement. Then again, that was better than this hunk of junk.It's a cornball film about some aliens and armaggedon and some such nonsense. This isn't even one where it's so bad it's good...it's just plain awful. Even the T & A scenes are screwed up since they are played by body doubles who are supposed to be the same main character, and yet have noticeably different sized breasts. Truly horrible. Avoid at all costs!"
1,At Swim - Alternate lifestyle preacher,"I found this book a huge disappointment. Rather than reading about Irish history or Irish Nationalism, the pages were full of ridiculous fantasies surrounding the gay lifestyle and child molestation. The author went to great lengths to try and humanize the main protagonist, as well as justifying his immoral and criminal activities. ..."
3,Beautiful but Frustrating,"I did not enjoy actually reading this, but I truly loved the story. The main story about 2 friends that swim together and discover that they have fallen in love with each other is very well done and I think quite original how it plays out. However, there are some side stories about religion, politics and war that actually just distract from the main focus of the book. Several times I wanted to take scissors and just cut out chapters of the book (the pregnant sister in law, the intrusive aunt, all unnecessary and frustrating). Also, just skip the entire first chapter, it has nothing to do with anything. The language was quite difficult, perhaps because I'm not Irish or it's not 1915. However, I could look beyond that because of the beautiful story and a few very sexy moments. Despite my complaints, I really do recommend the book, but wait until you have a summer to really take your time with this one, because it's not an easy read."
5,Love it!,This book is just one in a long series by Christine Feehan. It has everything you need to stay interested and thirsting for the next book. Dark Melody can stand alone or be read with the rest of the series.
5,5/stars fosr sure,Chritine Feehan is a gem beyond compair.I read her books from start to finish whether on my Kendle or in book form. Ecellent author.
1,Enough Already,"Enough already!! The first 3 were really the best because they were different. Now I am pretty sick of the Carpathian males who are all carbon copies of each other. I think that is why they have problems breeding, these males have all been cloned. The women are the worst though. I don't know about everyone else but I have never met anyone I just wanted to have relations with the very moment I met them. Wouldn't it be nice to get to know each other first, even just a little?? I thought this one might be a little better because the last one, Dark Symphony, was much better than they had been. Then this one, Dark Melody, back to the same old same old. I don't think I will be buying anymore of these."
2,Formulaic and dull,"The Carpathian series is slowly but surely petering out. The characters in this book are carbon copies of prior characters (the brooding, sexy, dark, handsome male paired with a weak-but-strong female) fitted into a predictable story line: meet, face a bit of danger, mate, convert, end. It's as if nothing happens to these couples once they are bonded, to wit, the bit about Tempest and Darius that pops up here. We're told Tempest has only been brought over for two weeks, yet she's fully adjusted to her new life. Sheesh, it took me months to get used to being married, and I didn't have to give up daylight and real food in the process! Time to put this to pasture - it was a good run while it lasted."
2,Disappointing,"Dark Melody is boring, mainly because I kept thinking that I had read entire passages lifted directly from her other books, and while I didn't actually get check book to book; I'm pretty sure that about half of the book was her regular spiel about Carpathinians - much like her last two Dark books. And I'm tired of it. She was one of the most exciting new writers to come out in the last couple of years, and now I don't think I will bother to pick her up again because though her story could be interesting -- her telling of it no longer is. I wish Feehan would take a break so that she could write something original and fresh again rather than giving us the same hero and heroine over and over again."
3,"Middle ground book. Played it safe, CF","This is Dayan's story of finding a lifemate.Despite Feehan's avid description of Dayan being brooding and a manly man Carpathian, he held no attraction for me. Maybe it's because I'm loyal to Gabriel. I dunno'.Corinne was too wishy-washy of a main character for me. I like my heroines with a little more fight and flavor. She was a bit plain, both in attitude and description.Average book, with an average story."
4,nice sequel,"holly and amanda are continuing their feud with the devereaux warlocks. nicole on the other hand has fled to parts unknown to escape the magic that nearly cost them their lives. holly is now the lead of the coven and her powers are growing past anything she ever expected. this book is not quite as good as the first one, but it will keep you enthralled with evil plots and schemes, lots of history lessons and life and death situations. i read it in 24 hours so it was not all bad."
3,"2nd game in series, perfect for fans","I watched the series a while back, and fell in love with it. Upon beating the first game a while back, I bought the second game in the series. If you are a true fan of the series the DVD itself is worth the purchase. I have not beaten the second due to this game gets old. I would be surprised anyone who is not a die-hard fan get more pass the second game in the series. I may come back to this. So this is for real fans only, after the second of the series."
3,repetitive,"this game was easier and shorter than the first. this game is exactly like the first, not too much more was added but i guess the story must go on."
4,Best Series Game Ever,"I've never played a game like it, you have a good base line of characters and an awsome fighting system. Man I can't believe such a game this good exists! I dont want to spoil any ""surprises"" in this game, so I need to say that this is a must have game. If you have a birthday coming up after May, definetely include this on your birthday list!!!"
2,Not impressed at all,"The book is not completely bad, but I wish it had more complete and accurate information -- there's much better material on the marketplace."
1,disappointed,I order this product thinking i was getting what was in the photo and they sent me something totally different from what is advertist wasn't happy wit the product...
5,Super helpful,I purchased this book as a gift for my husband. He has absolutely loved it. It is very helpful in planning out our garden based on what works best for our climate. We highly recommend it.
3,"Does the job, but a bit of a pain to install","It does the job and it's slick looking. The LED gives a nice touch. The only complaint I have is that these are a pain to install: The contact screws will not stay ""popped off"" once you unscrew them (they're screwed to a plate that moves freely inside the whole assembly). As a result, it becomes a total pain to ""hook"" the wire around the screw. Tip: During installation, block the inner plate by inserting a piece of wire into the push-in terminals. Just make sure you use something thin enough to make it easy to pop out later."
5,A brilliant journey to self-discovery!,"Jennifer's book is an eye opener to anyone that wants to make a difference in their life. She is witty, challenging, and intelligent. She requests you to think about the things you've been afraid of. She teaches you how to take appropriate risks along your journey of Work Less, Make More. She understands that within each one of us there is a burning desire to have more, do more, and be more in our lives! It's a great read. I highly recommend it to anyone who may be searching for the simple answers to life's big challenges."
2,big title - little delivery,"Mr. Haught's book initially raises great expectations for the reader due to his supposed familiarity with his subject material. But IMHO nothing was delivered. He seems skilled in introduction and critical appraisals. But he has nothing tangible to offer except vacuous prose. I would say the book is worth reading for those interested in what an opposing view to Dawkins or Dennett might entail. In my mind one of Daniel Dennett's footnotes from Darwin's Dangerous Idea nicely sums up such an attempt to offer an alternative view to real darwinism in a criticism of Paul Tillich's theological approach as ""bombastic redescription."""
2,Misleading....,"The description and look of this case is not what you think. I thought I would be getting a nice pink sturdy leather case to protect my phone but instead it was an ugly mix of purple and pink with bled purple stains on the back. If this was the only problem I might have kept it but it was SO flimsy and light, i think my phone would be more protected without it!!NOT happy at all w/ this product I paid 10 + shipping for!! What a waste!!"
3,Controlling Crohn's disease,Another interesting book on how this woman has been able to live w/ Crohn's. Would be a very difficult diet to follow and would require your whole families co-operation.
5,This is a very helpful book for a new mystery writer!,"If you have ever read a mystery & thought that you'd like to try writing one, then buy this book! I am a new mystery writer and this book has great pointers on how to write a mystery. The author gives a great outline of the essentials in writing and what is necessary in a mystery novel. The book doesn't waste your time. Each subject is organized in sequel order under it's own headline so it's easy to look up information quickly. She also provides examples from well known authors. Now when I read other mysteries or novels I pay closer attention to the outline, the plot, the point of view, and the sequences of cause & reaction."
4,A fascinating look at elections before the 12th Amendment,"Recent years have produced some very interesting works on specific US elections, and this book is a fine example. It's particularly enlightening on political gamesmanship applied to the pre-1804 electoral college system, with its bizarre feature of every elector getting two votes, not differentiated between President and Vice President. It hadn't occurred to me that ""President Pinckney"" had ever been considered a reasonable possibility by anyone in 1796 or 1800. The viciousness of the partisan attacks in this period has been described in greater detail in some recent books, but here is properly set in the overall political context."
1,Demons...Another so terrible single from Brian,"As if the so terrible ""Real to Me"" singles and his so terrible ""Irish Son"" debut album arent bad enough. Now comes Demons, another totally bad single from a very bad singer Brian McFadden, only Westlife Fans like. I'm lost beyond words, and advise any descent music fan to skip on this single, the same as to all works of Brian McFadden."
4,Canvas Brief Case,"This is a pretty good product. Material and workmanship were what I expected it to be. The only suggestions that I have are personal preferences. I would have liked the handle to be about two inches shorter, so it didn't feel like carrying a purse. I would also suggest adding some type of plastic framing around the interior of the case to help maintain its shape. Such a feature would make the bag even more attractive than what it is. I would also suggest that the outer pocket be zipped instead of velcroed. The interior pockets are sturdy and have a solid feel to them as well as the inside divider. I would add either a zipper or velcro to the inside pockets to keep items secure and not have them fall out inside the case. I got the black case. It is a good color. I would add charcoal gray to the selection as well."
4,wonderful,"the story instills desired values of ""money doesn't equal happiness"" and the illustrations are absolutely beautiful."
1,Another horse book,"Sharon Byford's The Arabian: A Guide For Owners is an account of the modern Arabian horse. Although it contains nothing new about the breed, some novis horsemen may find it worthwhile."
4,History - A Different Viewpoint,Very interesting view of history. Many of the things that we were not taught during our formal schooling are both thought provoking and entertaining. Looking at history through the eyes of these editors will truely enlighten our understanding. I enjoy this publication more each time I pick it up. A fine addition to any personal library.
3,The Book of Beanie Babies September 1998 by Lynn Dralle,"I purchased all the sets I could for this book plus the extra binder, but nothing after the September releases have been issued, I feel this set is incomplete as nothing was published after that date. What happened to all the releases and retirements after September 1998? Now I bought this set and can't complete it."
4,Transfixed 16 month old,"They say that imitation is the highest form of flattery - well this video series is a very close immitation of Julie Aigner-Clarke's 'Baby Einstein' video series (Disney). Same theme (although with food), and music, etc.Both my 16 month old son, and 2 1/2 year old daughter love the video and will watch transfixed for the full length. My son especially loves 'Chef Beary Good'.We have managed to introduce some new foods to our kids, because they had seen them on these videos."
5,One of her best!,"For those who thought that this book should have a ""moral"" or that there should be ""apologies"" at the end, I say, ""Welcome to the real world!"" I read this book in my elementary school years, and it was one of my favorites. It is honest, funny, disturbing, and interesting. It candidly dealt not only with bullying but with racism. Don't be afraid to let your kids read this. It shows that in the real world not everyone gets their just deserts."
4,Rembering Fifth Grade,I loved this book. I felt like I was stepping into that girls classroom and life. It was very realistic and it had a good lesson. I am going to have my daughter read all of Judy Blume's books. Her writing really relates to kids.
3,No more at this point,"Although I had bitter feeling after I read this book which reminded me of my schooltime with bullying girls, I found this book still depicted bullying and how things get worse easily between kids in a cute way. They are no more at this point."
1,Fry pan very light weight.,Did not care for the pans. They were very light weight and felt cheap. We returned.
1,Ken's a dud,"What happened to Ken? Mattel has turned out really terrible Ken dolls over the past few years, but this is rock bottom. I don't agree with the reviewer who objected to Barbie sitting on Ken's shoulders, but I do agree with everyone who hated this doll's face mold and hair style. The only guy dolls I buy now are the My Scene boys, who I love because they aren't all blonde Barbie colnes, and the Happy Family Alan and Grandpa, because they have distinctive faces also. I've seent he new Blaine doll, and he's much more intertesing to look at than this poor guy. Mattel, please give this guy some more thought and a makeover!"
3,ken was dissed again. :(,"poor poor ken. he defintitly did NOT deserve all this bad rap he has been getting. barbie and ken were dating for 40 years, and now..barbie has gotten to ""cool"" for him. how could you do this to us mattel? you broke up the power couple of the century. shame, shame, shame on you."
2,Unsafe and unfair!,"We bought this for my son who turned one. He can walk, crawl, get around and is pretty coordinated. When he uses his one arm to press down on this truck to move it across the carpet the rear wheels of the truck quickly buck up the front of the truck and hit him in the forehead. After this happened three times, we removed it from the playroom. So many tears....not a nice way to introduce your son to trucks! We are sending it back to Little Tykes. We were really surprised they didn't think this one through. Did anyone the age of 1 actually test this out before it hit the shelves?"
2,Why is it in english when its a japanese movie?!?,I was amazed by the fact that I recived the movie so quickly but I was unaware of the fact that it didn't have japanese audio although it was a japanese movie which really dissapointed me! Mainly because i like the movie very much and it best in japanese!!!
5,The one and only,"This is the one and only cook book my mother ever had! And boy, did she learn! This is the only ""Criollo"" style cookbook that I know of. It helped bring back the memories of Cuba. Needless to say, she became a first class cook. Highly recommended, knowledge of basic Spanish is a plus."
1,Terrible,"I have found this product to be a complete bucket of guano. Although it hasn't ""Hung"" my computer it creates CD's that are not recognized by the computer they were created on, let alone a remote box. It creates CD's that stop in the middle of a track, or ""hang"" not playing the track at all. It is consistent in that it creates an unreliable CD in either CD Copy or Data mode. I won't use it again."
1,Hope this is the end of the series!,"What an absolutely horrible book: ridiculous plotlines; characters you want to smack for being so stupid, mean or selfish; and a sense of ""Thank God this book is ended"" when you're finished!"
3,Not Bad...,"We received this dumptruck as a gift. My son is 11 months and seems to enjoy playing with this truck. Had I read some of these reviews before giving him the truck, I probably would have returned it to the store for something else. However, I must say that we have not had any incidents of ""malfunction"" when he has been playing with it. He seems to enjoy putting things in the back of the dumptruck more than pushing it around. We also have the FisherPrice ""Rollin' Rumblin' Dump Truck"" which I would HIGHLY recommend over this dumptruck."
3,Better when he was with New Grass Revival,"Sam is a great picker, but I enjoyed his music with New Grass Revival more. Still a good album."
1,This book was NOT a winner.,"I enjoy Heather Graham's historicals for their rich detail, and memorable characters. Drop Dead Gorgeous had neither.The characters were as shallow as a 1 inch pool of water,and their dialogue lacked that spark that keeps one interested. While I didn't guess the killer until the end, and I though the sex was pretty good, I was constantly turned away from the story by the vacuous ""heroes"" and ""heroines"". Also, Ms. Grahams constant repetition of the phrase ""DROP DEAD GORGEOUS"" throughout the book was way over the top.Sorry Heather, I just wasn't feeling it."
2,disappointed,I was very disapointed in this product.The plain has at most one minute of air time.they could of just stated on the box and save me [some money].
1,What A JOKE!,"This cheap foam plane is probably only worth a few dollars. I bought it for a 10 year old and it never flew. It crashed and broke the wing off instead. It was actually more stressful than enjoyable, and I think SpinMaster should compensate people for having to deal with their defective product. I was suspicious when I opened the box because of the repeated warnings not to return it to the store - which is a sign of a poor product. Don't add any more stress to your life by buying this item. Since it breaks so easily, you may not be able to return it the next day after you realize it's not useful. Buy a stunt kite instead - they don't break as easily and only need some wind to fly."
4,flying high in texas,"With a ranch and plenty of open space to fly, we had a blast flying this plane. We had cousins trying to fly a Cox beginner plane costing over $... that ended up in pieces after two unsuccessful attempts. The Intruder needs LOTS of room to fly and you really must read the directions and watch the video to understand how it works. While it is taking off immediately push the thrust up so that when the 5 seconds of self control are over you have it gaining altitude. We had plenty of hard landings with no damage at all. We did however need our 4-wheelers to keep running after it to stay within range of the radio controller. Now all the cousins want one of these!"
1,GARBAGE! DO NOT BUY!!!,"I am 34, and I bought this to use with my kids. It flies OK, but THE BATTERY CHARGE NEVER LASTS MORE THAN ONE MINUTE!!! THis thing is a joke. It is not worth the money. If even the slightest wind is present, the plane will crash or go way off course! BUYER BEWARE!"
3,Calm Winds Only,"You can only fly this plane successfully in winds less than 5 mph. Completely calm days are best. Let the plane fly itself and only use quick momentary pulses of the stick to turn, sharp turns will put the plane into a spinning dive, resulting in a crash. If the plane remains in a turn, pulse the stick to straighten it. Remember that left is right and vice versa when the plane is coming toward you. I've spun it down more than once turning the wrong way to straighten it's flight after it changed direction. Overall, I'd say it's a fun toy and a great inexpensive intro into RC flying."
1,no control,"I had high hopes for this one...Could never get control. Maybe something was wrong with it?Did not really seem to have a lot of power either. Needed to have a pretty calm day.It did seem to be very durable -- it needed to be since it flew wherever the wind took it.I tried on 3 different occasions, but evetually returned it and was told that they have had a lot of them returned.I am surprised so many others gave it such high marks."
4,Cali girl Review,I think the Barbie is really good and enjoyable even though i am ten it is sutible for any age and all of the little ones i bet there having an execlant time because i have a great time
3,Do u like ur Barbie Well Done? or Medium Rare,"Cali girl wouldn't be the word i'd entitle this doll. Maybe something like Hang tan Barbie or Beachbum Barbie would've been more appropriate. I have a few complaints about the doll she's just too dark almost as dark as the Christie doll. Second her hair doesn't really work almost ragged especially the coloring that was used. On a good note I like the design on her eyes which is wide and big. The shape of her body is also a plus and she's cheap. Personally if ur looking for a cheap yet decent looking doll out of the ""cali girl"" line I'd purchase her and maybe rename her SHEENA. I bought one anyways b/c of those factors."
4,For serious historians.,"Prodigiously thorough American history from 1754 to 1800 but no humor, irony or drama. Makes it a rather gray read. And he might hate Hamilton."
3,guitar pickup covers,"I needed DiMarzio pickup covers for my Fender guitar in white because the DM pickups that I owe are black. It was a dissapointment that DiMarzio don't want to sell the covers outside the US / Canada.If I had know it before I never had bought DM pickups.Anyway my cousin in The States had bought it for me and handed over to me in The Netherlands.After all it appears that the covers are to narrow for my DiMarzio Vintage pickups.I still can not understand that DiMarzio treat his customers outside the US so bad, it' s shamefull!"
4,A Fascinating Story of Courage and Perseverance,"I purchased this book for a young friend after reading it myself. It is is a fascinating story of a young girl who survives a terrible time in American history with courage and perseverance. I would recommend it highly for young teens, individuals interested in American history, and anyone who enjoys reading children's books. My young friend recently wrote me to say she also really enjoyed it."
5,Fever 1793,"Fever is a great book for readers that love to read about families. Also if you love history books, you'll love this book. It's sad and touching. Fever takes place in Philidelphia. Yellow fever is spreading and people are fleeing. Read this book and find out what happens. I recommend this book."
3,It's Ok..,"As for as historical fiction for kids, this book is ok I think. It gives a very good description of the yellow fever and what happened when it hit in 1793. It has it's ups, but I believe it could've been better. It wasn't a book that I couldn't put down I more or less felt I had to finish it. (although I do not know why I forced myself to do so)"
4,Historical fiction,This was a good book of historical fiction and would be a good read for junior readers and adult readers alike.
3,Fever 1793,I liked this book fo various reasons.It kept me on a thrill ride throughout the book.There was also some bad parts about the book.Like it would have to much diologue.I give this book a three out of five.It's a good book to read but i couldn't read it every day.
3,Fever 1793.,I give this book a 3 stars because there were about 3 exciting parts in it. This book {Fever 1793}is about a girl named Matilda. Matilda is trying to battle yellow fever and find her mother at the same time. I would not recommend this book because it was very dull and boring. I did like how well the author painted a clear picture in my mind of what was going on.
4,Fever 1793,"Fever 1793By Laurie Halse AndersonThe book Fever 1793 is a good book. It is about a very deadly that is going around Philadelphia. The characters call the fever, ""Yellow Fever"". It is said to come every late summer around August.The main character's family owns a coffeehouse. The main character's name is ""Mattie"". Mattie is the hardest working employee in their family coffeehouse gets a lot of business because George Washington's house was built two blocks away.Yellow Fever is a bad illness. The fever has been mostly caught by the river. It has been scaring people away from the shops near the river. The people being scared causes the coffeehouse to get more business.Polly was the 1st one to die from the disease. A lot of people died because of the Yellow Fever. Even Mattie's mother died. This illness caused a lot to move away too.I hope you choose to read this book and enjoy it as much as I did. I give this book a 4 star rating. To find out the end, read this book. The ending is great."
4,Fever 1793 by Aneisha,Fever 1793 was a good book about a fever thatspread in Philadelphia.I gave it 4 stars becauseI started to lose interest but it was avery goodand I really like it.
4,This Book Is About A Girl Who's Family Members Get Struck With Yellow Fever.,"The book ""Fever 1793""is a very good book for many good reasons. I rated this book 4 out of 5 stars. I'll tell you why.I think Fever 1793 is a 4 out of 5 star book because it's a great book, but I'm not to crazy about the olden day language. (Like Ma and Pa and yawl.) Other than that it's a great book. It's about a girl who's family gets struck with YELLOW FEVER. Matilda has no father and her maid Mistress Polly Logan gets struck with YELLOW FEVER and she doesn't end up making it through. Along the way her grandfather gets YELLOW FEVER, but he makes it. YAH!!! So if you think this is an interesting book, you should read it."
2,Tried to read it...,"I originally wanted to read this with my students, and it was recommended to me by a colleauge. However, I found it very dry and a dragged out story. I think it would bore my students, even with the interesting background of the Yellow Fever in Pennsylvania."
1,"Low, Low Budget","Give this one a pass. The sound is terrible, the girls can't sing, the ""humor"" is weak, and the songs fall flat. If attitude alone were enough, they might get two stars."
4,Review- Dragonball Z season 1 DVD( Vegeta Saga),"It started out as battle with Goku & Piccolo team up defeating Raditz. When Goku dies & he spends his new upgrade training with King Kai. Piccolo takes over training Goku's son Gohan. This season entire covers Nappa & Vegeta battle. You can witness some deaths of the Z warriors, growing up of the weak Gohan.Pro:Remaster with clearer vision.5.1 Digital master English surround soundVery cool cover Dvd boxset, Pages preview bookletSpecial Features of the remake from original dragonball featuresMaraton ModeCons:The english subtitles is 99% wrong from the DVDThe japanese music in each series is missingThe japanese music starting & ending theme is only feature in special FeatureOverall:I would still buy it because for just less than $30, you get 39episode/6disc from season 1. The series is 5* because of the music, i am giving 4*."
1,WARNING: Not For DBZ Purists - Image is disgracefully cropped,$cumimation blows it once again. One begins to wonder if they continually release flawed versions in order to keep milking Tori-sama's great cash-cow.
2,Widescreen format ruins otherwise welcome release,"This version of DBZ season one has been re-mastered and has the unprecedented option of listening to the Japanese music with the English voice cast. However I would recommend NOT purchasing this title. It is in a wide-screen version which cuts off the top and bottom of the original picture, and adds in incidental footage on the sides. I suggest waiting for a proper full-screen release."
3,"If you were hoping for the ""Rock The Dragon"" intro theme, you will be upset","I was really hoping to hear the ""Rock The Dragon"" theme at the beginning of these episodes. But they all have the Japanese intro music. All the reviews I had read said that the English dub had the US music, but they meant the music during the episodes, not the intro. I remember watching DBZ on Cartoon Network, and the main reason I bought the season 1 orange box was for the intro I remember, but I was sadly surprised.As for the widescreen, I don't mind it. So many are screaming that it cuts out a lot of the picture, and there are parts that you can tell are cut off (people's foreheads, feet, etc) but I don't mind. The sound is good, also.My main gripe is the lack of the intro I remembered from Cartoon Network. That is basically the only reason I gave it such a low review score. Other than that, the episodes bring back a lot of memories and I'm having a great time watching them!"
2,Disappointed,"The item shipped really fast and was here the first day possible but as soon as I opened it it was tattered and there were stains that could have been easily removed but no attempt was made to. I checked out all the discs to make sure they were clean and the first disc was incredibly scratched so I played it and twice my DVD player said could not read disc. Sometimes it's skippy as well, how annoying! The other discs were pretty much okay looking but who knows. Gunna be pretty hard to watch the whole season if you can't get past the first disc."
4,Dragon ball z season one,It contains the full Saiyan saga and the z fighters struggle to overcome them. The fighting is full with action and intense. Episodes are all in great quality. It's as good as the other seasons in terms of condition and quality. Overall very good purchase and a good watch.
3,the old & the new,"This book I first read as a youth, and found that although it was written in an era gone by, it still packed a punch. It becomes easy to follow despite terminology and is hard to put down."
5,Perfect way to learn the alphabet and animals,What a way to teach your children the alphabet and love for animals. Very creative and fun filled. My 4 year old boy can't stop playing it.
5,Love the Show?,"This comic is amazing! My daughter has Vol. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5! She loves the show and comic. The graphics of the novel and comic are identical actually the same! I would recommend this book to a friend who is interested in this kind of genre."
4,Sounds of the EARLY 90's,"Most of the songs were from the early 90's....But they were great songs. It immediately took me back to my college days and the club scenes. Many of these songs just aren't on any of the radio play cycles for one reason or another..making them all the more enjoyable. Some of the songs aren't on the radio because they were so played out..but i am ready to hear ""Can't touch this"" and ""Ice ice Baby"" now..a 10 year hiatus is plenty enough!!"
2,Crib Mobile,Music is too loud and when you wind it up all the way it only spins for about 60 seconds.
1,doesn't matter how good it can be it it busts,"We have had two of these, they both stopped working. Razer pretend they will exchange them but they won't. This is bait-and-switch but they hope you won't make a fuss for a hundred bucks. This is a VERY expensive mouse for a couple of weeks' use but I am sorry to say they have guessed right - I have already wasted too much of my life on arguing about this. Moving to Logitech G5 which is not nearly so cool-sounding but might possibly not get ripped off and treated like a moron. I have to say they work great when you take them out of the box, so it's doubly a shame when they stop working after a couple of weeks and the company basically flips you the bird. This company would have done great things, and could have even survived the lousy quality of their products if support wasn't so arrogant and condescending."
5,Simply Stunning,"How can an artist be this talented? Mary puts so much into her work, and you know shes lived through this, its not like those songs you hear by those wannabe teen pop artists that sing about heartbreak, they dont know what they are singing about, Mary puts her heart into it, shes lived it. Ballads is a collection of Mary's best ballads, released only in Japan. The songs on here are from Whats The 411, My Life, Share My World and Mary. There is also a bonus track, for those hardcore fans that are looking for Overjoyed, the track produced by Stevie Wonder featured in the Nike ad, well its here. This may seem expensive but its worth it, for this talent who wouldnt want to pay to hear that beautiful voice, a voice too beautiful for words."
5,STILL THE QUEEN OF HIP/HOP SOUL,"I am a true MJB fan and I'm one of the fans that are waiting for the store to open to get my musical high. MJB never ceases to amaze me. She keeps me interested, excited and wanting more from the beginning to the finale.Look for Freed By Love,""Nothing But The Drama"" a book that was inspired by MJB it is a must read. The writer of this book credits Mary for alot of her lyrics. The book is available at amazon.com. Check it out.But this album compilation is simply marvelous. Thank you Mary I haven't sampled any Mary cd that was not banging and anyone who doesn't believe that is simply a hater.Mary's #1 Fan. Don't forget to read Freed By Love the book dedicated to MJB..."
1,Do not buy this product,"I bought this because it was inexpensive and I don't need much for my purposes of video editing. this product, however, is horrible. It can't even meet my basis needs. I get eror messages constantly and it crashes every time I use it. This is no exageration. I have never actually exited out of the program because it always crashes on it's own. It doesn't work well with XP (which is never really mentioned anywhere). The help (both in the help menu and online) is not very helpful. No user manual was included. It was just a very bad product. Check out their online help site and you will see an abundance of negative feedback (I didn't see this until after I purchased the product and was going there to get help). I could go on for even longer about it but I won't. I don't know what else is out there, but there has to be something better than this. Even if it costs a little more it would be worth it!!"
2,Looks good up front,"I bought this product as an alternative to having to upgrade the Easy CD Creator ver. 5 from the OEM version 4 after installing the XP upgrade to my ME. It doesn't work either-at least not the NTI CD Burner. It won't work with IE 6. The package also comes with Cakewalk Pyro-which I've tried to use to burn CD's but is very slow and inconsistent (3 of seven cuts played-the rest gave me error messages) I suspect because it's designed more toward Mp3 and WAV devices. So far, the CD label Maker piece is great with tons of graphic alternative and also very easy to use. My suggestion, don't fight city hall-just roll with the Easy CD creator upgrade, I'm going to."
2,dissapointed corabi fan,"first album was GREAT, live album was GREAT, this album, however is a GREAT DISSAPOINTMENT. it's almost as bad as 'new tattoo'."
3,"Love it, but expensive","My son is crazy over this toy! It is so much fun to watch him play the guitar! Great product, but expensive! I got it as a gift."
4,If you don't mind the noise...,"Both my kids like the Wiggles. They have a lot of Wiggles toys scattered around the house. The Wiggles Guitar has been the favorite for a year now. But it is LOUD! And the original batteries are still in it. (Of course, the loudest toys never seem to run out of juice!)If your kids love the Wiggles, they'll love this guitar."
4,Causes cramping,"I found the Wiggles guitar to be too small. Being an adult male I found myself unable to extend my left arm while playing, which caused some cramping. However, my 2 1/2 yr. old son liked it and so it is his now. He likes to sing along with it."
3,Wiggles Guitar,"The sound on this guitar is really bad!!! For the songs that play there is a lot of static! My three year old still likes it, but I was very disappointed and thought that the money would have been better spent on something else."
4,Volume Solution,"I do understand how this guitar can be unnervingly loud, however I have also found out a way to limit the volume on this and many other childrens toys that do not have a mute (as I have done to many of my sons toys.) I usually put clear packaging tape (3M brand) over the speaker and slowly poke out some of the holes until I find my personal volume preference. Usually if you apply the tape clearly and tightly the child doesn't realize the volume difference or tape. Hope that helps...I am sure that this might work a little better than just hiding it somewhere out of sight when you finally fed up listening to it."
4,Good Starter Text,"I've never done any irrigation work until recently. So I took a one day course from a pro and bought this book. Since a one day course can't cover all contingencies, I found that this book filled in a lot of gaps. My interest has mainly been in drip systems, not sprinklers. I now have a good working knowledge and sound like less of a fool when I order stuff from experts.BTW, I think with this book and all the free specialized information on the Internet, most folks don't have to go much further to study the subject."
4,Great overall floor lamp,"I bought 2 of these lamps to go with the stainless steel theme in my house. Even though they're not real stainless but just a stainless finished look, they blend in well and it's hard to notice the difference unless you're really close. They were easy to put together and give off a good amount of light, with a natural feel. The switch also works as a dimmer. The halogen bulb does look like it will be hard to replace but I'll worry about that when I get there."
1,Do not use it with Comcast,"I used it to hook up my HD TV to the Comcast HD cable box and it did not work well, I lost many HD channels.It is my first big disappointment with a Monster product, and it is so unfortunate because the cable looks very nice and good quality (as all monster products).Read other reviews and stick to the coaxial cable provided by your cable company."
5,A great remaster of a clasic.,"Had this album from long ago and have been looking for the CD for a long time. Tried one and the quality was awful but now it has been reborn again and at a great price. This is a colection of songs by of course, Jacques Brel, who I believe to have been a genius who's life was cut short by lung cancer at the age of 49 years. The cast of four are fantastic. You have to listen to the lyrics. This CD may change the way you look at life. Rochelle"
5,Classy and easy to assemble,Unfortunatley this mobile didn't end up matching my crib bedding and by the time my crib bedding arrived in the mail it was too late for me to return this item. Other then it not matching.. it is a very pretty mobile and was simple to put together.
2,Best Of?,"I'll just get to the point; this CD was a waste of time. First of all it covers a period only 3 records: Alms House (1 track), Prophecy (3 tracks), & the weak I-Testament (6 tracks). There is a mediocre 1993 single thrown in, which leads me to the second problem - only 11 tracks. The Prophet's work really began to soar in the late '90's, after the covered period, so most of the best was yet to come(& is still coming!). Despite this, there are some really good tracks here: Alms House & anything off of Prophecy ('Leave Babylon' still gvz me goosebumps affa all deez yrs). You are, however, wasting your time if you buy this CD even if you have no Capleton at all. I recommend starting out with Prophecy - 12 Amazing tracks with 3 re-mixes to boot. Dis will get yo' fiyah burnin'."
3,NO GOOD DEED GOES UNPUNISHED - AGAIN!!!!!!,"Here's a story within a story that is a bit distracting to get into. But, with a little perseverance, it hooks you after a while. Again Jessie Arnold, altho pampering a recovering knee injury, agrees to help out at the Alaska State Fair with her beloved, Tank, at her side. ( I want this dog!!!!)A little boy, Danny and a Senior Assisted Living escapee (:D) meet and form a great alliance against the world! Danny inadvertently picks up a backpack belonging to the bad guys and the story takes off from there. Anxiety sets in when Tank is stolen as a hostage in order to get Jessie to return the backpack. This is the tensest part of the book for me. The way Jessie and Tank meet again is gulping time.Alex Jensen returns this time and it looks like he will hang around for a while. Think I am all caught up on Ms Henry's books for a while and will await her next."
4,An Ultimate Cozy,"Sue Henry has provided her faithful readers with an ultimately cozy mystery. In the first two pages of the book, we learn not only that heroine and Iditarod-musher Jessie Arnold's beloved lead dog, Tank, is going to get dog-napped, but also that everything turns out all right in the end. In these days when reading the newspaper provides all the unpleasant suspense a reader could ask for, I felt very grateful to Ms. Henry for eliminating my worries about Tank, and allowing me to read with pure pleasure.Tank is already one of the most well-rounded characters in the Jessie Arnold series, and the depth of characterization (without undue anthropomorphism) of this quadruped and his relation to Jessie distinguish this series. Readers who value those talents of Ms. Henry will not be disappointed by this novel."
4,"Okay, but not the best",It took a little bit to get used to the different format of the book but i got used to it and i liked it once i got used to the different style. I probably won't reccamend this for a first time sue henry reader cause her other books i think are a little better.
2,Beginner saw only,"I have bought this scroll saw in 1993. The large capacity has been very helpful. Overall, the saw did was I purchased it for, but I was sure glad to get the Delta saw with the graphite arms a couple years ago. The Grizzly saw vibrated excessively. I clamped it to a kitchen table, and it still was vibrating very much. Other annoying problems experienced is the blade clamping guards always loosening and the connection between the motor and the arms came loose. This machine would be good for a starter if you lacked the money to purchase one with less vibration; consequently it is now in the attic waiting for my daughter when she moves out."
5,Update to previous review...,"I just found a small black switch on the bottom of the car that is an On/Off/Try Me switch. When the switch is in the &quot;Try Me&quot; mode, it only plays &quot;Toot, toot, chugga, chugga Big Read Car&quot;. When it's in the &quot;On&quot; mode, it plays a little longer version!"
3,Just O.K.,"I bought this cart because I needed extra space in my little apartment kitchen but it turned out O.K. I am really good at assembling furniture but this one was a problem. The doors did not align right and they do not close well either. Also the drawer is really hard to open and close which made me place items inside that I do not use too often. Overall it is just O.K not great. I had a similar item in the past,, around the same price range and it was made a lot better."
3,Christmas Present,I bought this for a Christmas Present. She seems to enjoy it. It is well made of durable plastic. The seatbelts were a little weird. Hard to figure out how to put the dolls inside.
2,"Good idea, bad product","I bought this for my 2-1/2 yr old daughter. She has 2 brother that play ice hockey, and was very excited to be on the ice. I thought it would be a good thing seeing how young she is, and that it was also adjustable. First thing was, the leather straps are not all secure, and my husband ended up having to put 2 or more holes in each strap. Okay...not big deal, right?The real problem came when she tried to skate, due to the fact the screw underneath the skate keep getting loose and the skate expand out, he foot falls off. This happened over and over again the whole night, and we must have stopped to put the back on and rescrew atleast 20 times. After awhile we got tired of the whole process and went home.She did have fun however on the ice, and with us pushing her, she seemed to glide fine. Again though, stopping every 45 seconds or so, ruined it for us."
4,First toddler skates,"Good first pair of ice skates for our three year old. Very stable on ice and easy to adjust.However, wing nut at the bottom have tendency to become loose and needs tightening every once in a while and that is why I didn't give 5 stars."
5,Interesting points,"Interesting book with seven excellent points of the Spanish Conquest. For those who have done any kind of research into this period of history, would for the most part, agree to Mr. Restall's points. I was curious to see his explanations to the myths and his justifications. I found it enjoyable reading as a whole and agreed to most of his myths. This book would be more meaningful and insightful to a reader who has done some previous reading in this area."
5,Essential Tyner,"Great CD. The remake of trombonist Steve Turre's ""Let It Go"" ( also featured here ), is as equally incredible as his original version."
4,Great for first time Palm programmers,I consider myslef a beginning/intermediate level VC++ programmer and found this book a very good starting point for learning Palm programming. Examples were clearly defined and timely comparisons to Windows/Unix programming were made to ease understanding of Palm nuances. The only downfall is the CodeWarrior Lite product that comes with the book is so crippled it makes it hard to use (not the authors fault).
3,THIS IS NOT A BEGINNERS BOOK,"Of all the Palm Programming books I have on my desk, I generally look at this book second for hints. Here are the Cons:- It is heavy on CodeWarrior (fyi.. I use CW) and if you haven't bought CW then don't buy this book either. Second, the book is getting somewhat dated. Third, if you want to dabble with Palm programming then I would say this book is not for you. On the Pro side: if you are going to be doing this for a living, the topics it covers are generally very useful and that's why I consider it good to have around."
4,Good reference for Codewarrior users,"I use Codewarrior and was extremely happy with the amount of good reference material in this book. It goes into more detail (in my opinion) on some of the finer points in programming for the Palm OS than the dummies series book does. However, the book seems written more for people who have a little experience with Palm OS programming already under their belt..."
2,Paddle too short for emotion kayak,"The paddle is made well but is too short for the Emotion Glide kayaks we purchased. The Glide kayak is a sit in type with fairly high gunwales. This means you have to hold the paddle very high and at a large angle to reach the water. Both my wife and high found this to be very tiring. I extended both our paddles to 96"" with aircraft aluminum tubing and they now work well. We also found that we could only use the paddle with the blades vertical. The other position places the blades at a wierd, unusable angle."
3,So So Album,"Typical soundtrack released in coordination with an upcoming movie release.Please ignore the RACIST comments above by Bekki Rosie Kalk.Every track on this cd is listenable, the best track though is OUTKASTS ""Land of a million drums"" the beat is so catchy and you cant help but dance to it.Worth a buy!"
4,dissapointed,"I was dissapointed because the cd didn't have the song that I was looking for. The song that plays right after the group decides to split apart, u know when they all said "" I quit"". Otherwise, I like the cd. And especially, love the movie. We watch it all the time with my sons."
3,Good but......,"Why aren't there more BANDS on this soundtrack? The reason I haven't bought it and probably won't is b/c it's all hip-hop and rap. If you're into that, that's cool, but I'm not. I like MxPx, Simple Plan, and the Atomic Fireballs but that's about where it ends for me on this. I do have to say that the Outkast song is good but I only like it b/c of the beat and the chorus."
4,No comment as I have not yet read book.,"If I have to abide by your strict guidelines covering my comments, this will be the last time I rate any book purchase."
2,DOES NOT WORK WITH PSP 2000!,It will not sync my PSP 2000 like it said it would. I am stuck with it because the return policy was expired by the time I gave up on it.
3,PSP Media Manager,"PSP Media ManagerGreat program but not recommended for windows Vista any other windows 98, xp great"
5,Easy to transport and Clean!,Product is easy to clean. It dries up pretty quick. Very light which makes it easy to transport. the seat also folds for easy storage.
4,review,The necklace and earrings that I purchased were just as beautiful as they were on the web!! I am very satisfied with this product! I would buy from this web site again!!
1,CBEST Cliffs Test Prep from the reading company,"My first comment is only for from the reading company.I needed to work on the math. They said there were some pencil marks.Actually, all the math programs had been worked out where the choiceswere, making the book worthless. A complaint to the company said that it said there were some pencil marks.The book itself has math that is much harder the CBEST, and they wereactually sued for it. I actually didn't go to my first appointment based on the misinformation in the book. I then bought the Barron's up to date book and it was perfect."
5,Only book you need to buy!,"I had this book shipped to me less than a week before the exam, and this is the only book I used to study for the test. I passed with a 183, and read this book front to back (more or less) in the few days before the exam. The example questions and answers are throughly explained, and are particularly helpful for the math section (if you're like me, and haven't taken a math class in many years).The only tip I have for anyone taking the CBEST, is to brush up on your conversion charts for math--(i.e. how many feet in a mile, how many pints in a gallon...etc. etc.) there were a couple of questions along those lines, that I just couldn't remember!Now, onto taking the CSET this September...any useful information anyone can offer me??! ha ha ha."
4,Love it,"Shipping is really fast, and the book is brand new one. I have been using it to study, hope I could pass CBEST at one time"
1,cheap made,"The clock is very cheap made, I won't pay more than $1 for that. The back cover was broken, probably damaged during shipping. Have to return it."
2,Curry,"While this product is easy to use, the taste is inferior to the original seasoning brick. If you want easy, use this product. If you want better flavor, use the original."
3,Of interest for Claire fans--or for Patty's,"This is not bluegrass but country, an early Claire album cut for a Roanoke, VA, independent label in the early 1980s. It doesn't have that great Front Porch String Band groove, but Claire sounds terrific and there was some stuff here that got heard in Nashville and was quite influential. If you enjoy Patty Loveless's early albums, the clean, neo-traditional arrangements on those were copied in at least one case from this record. It's well worth hearing for Claire fans, but if you're new to Claire, start with ""Friends for a Lifetime"" or ""Moonlighter."""
2,Soap Opera Byzantine History,"Even though its content is well laid out, I have to state without discretion that ""Byzantium;: The Imperial centuries, A.D. 610-1071"" should not be deemed as a good source if one is to learn a basic history of the Byzantine Empire. First, the style is very insipid with the author constantly making sanguine comments on historical figures, as if he was gossiping with friends about the ""National Inquirer"". Second, his research is weak. There are but a handful of references in the bibliography showing that the author's reach for primary research is short. And finally, he uses a poor pattern in trying to tie the East with the West, rather than attempting to keep the western kingdoms in the fringes and focus on the foreground of the book, the Byzantine Empire. In all, a weak and flat book."
1,defective time-keeping!,"I have owned several very reliable Westclox clocks, but as far as keeping time accurately goes, this is the poorest clock I've ever seen. In the first 2 weeks that I owned it, I noticed that it was jumping ahead about 10 minutes per day. I gave it a new battery. In the ensuing weeks, it gained time at a faster pace, as much as an hour per day. I again replaced the battery. Now it does not function at all. And unfortunately with this purchase, the seller's return policy doesn't permit returns after 15 days, even for defective merchandise."
3,"A good read, but depressing","First let me say that this book is well-written and the author is clearly talented. I was not expecting a collection of individual stories but that is what this is. About halfway through the book, I realized each story was extremely sad: someone dies, or is abandoned, or is humiliated, or is utterly alone. It is not a happy book to read so don't pick this one up if you are already feeling depressed!"
2,does the job,"It does the job. The product quality is great but the lids do not stay screwed on tightly as others. Its compact and great for traveling or carrying it for everyday. The bad thing is that for the largest case, i placed my power foundation and its a bit too small for that. i use the lid to spread the foundation and the powder gets stuck in between the screw lines and causes the container to become loose. One of the lids with a clear top, the clear part came off. now there's the use of the lid."
2,Not pleased.,"The book was mediocre IMO. It seemed as if Ms Alers rushed to complete this book in a few of hours. I like to become one with the characters and I didn't feel it here. Maybe if more time was spent 'getting to know' the ins and outs of the characters, the reader can bond and become better attached. Although this was my first time reading one of Aler's books, I will definitely give her a second chance based only on fond reviews of her followers."
2,Not a Miyazaki film!!!,"Fantastic visuals. Storyline was lame, predictable. Characters were underdeveloped and uninteresting. warning: Not a Miyazaki film! It only comes up in amazon search because one of the voice actors or something is also named Miyazaki. Great concept, great graphics and a cool world created centered around a dry, dead story with no focus. Not a bad idea, but poor execution and nothing at all like any Miyazaki movie...."
4,A solid movie.,"I enjoyed this movie very much. Yes, it has a distinct Ghibli feel to it, and while they don't pull off the grandness that movies like Nausiica and Mononoke Hime manage this movie is still a wonderful watch. The man vs. nature theme is done well, not going overly preachy, but more thought provoking. As others have mentioned, the scenery is beautiful and masterfully rendered. The characters weren't overly captivating, but certainly likable and interesting to watch. The music was gorgeous (and the Kokia song at the end is her best song, in my opinion) and worth the viewing just to hear it.My only complaint is that this should have been longer. I saw the original theatric previews and they showed more characters and much more depth. Some intruiging scenes were apparently just cut out or were just left out after they put out the previews. If they had found a way to put more of that into the movie, it would have been a perfect 5."
2,It had potential,"The beginning of the movie seemed like it had potential. I think some of the ideas in the story could have been developed into a more interesting film, for example, the concept of enhanced beings and plant growth taking on a life of it's own.However, ultimately, the movie was short on story, plot, and character development. We don't get a good feel for who Agito and Toola are, and what they stand for. Alot of the film seems to be Agito screaming ""Toola!"", and Toola screaming ""Agito!""I really did not get the point of it and I didn't like the ending either. If you ask me, the ending was rather inconclusive.My favorite part was the beginning song with the flying dragon-plant thing."
3,Visually Stunning? Please.,"I don't get why everyone's so gaga for the visuals in this movie. Sure, there are a couple of good moments; however, most of the movie is done with horrible shading (similar style to a lot of 15 year old anime fan artists out there). This jarring, overly blurred shading only brings your attention to the other deficits in the drawing.The line quality is garbage - I couldn't believe I was watching a bluray at first. I thought I had mistakenly bought the DVD, but no. There's no refinement to the line, nor is the line pleasantly unrefined. It's simply awful.Most egregious is the coloring. The whole thing looks like it was colored by a high schooler. Some shots look awfully oversaturated, and sometimes the hue of people/objects doesn't change even under drastically different lighting.I cannot believe an art director gave the go ahead on this. Most TV quality animators do better."
2,Yet Another Environmental Fantasy,"What I would call 'Environmental Fantasies' are a prominent sub-group in Anime. 'Origin-Spirits of the Past' is an example of this genre, but it offers little new compared to previous films. My opinion is that Miyazaki did this same kind of thing, but in a much more original mold, when he made Nausicaa and Princess Monoke. The graphics in 'Origin' are decent, but the situation, characters, and dialogue are all derivative."
3,"Good, But Ultimately Underwhelming","Mostly this anime came off as really, really wanting to be a Miyazaki film. It's a decent watch and I don't regret the time I invested in it, but I was underwhelmed with the rather derivative elements of the story. Princess Mononoke and Nausicaa are both stronger films dealing with many of the same concerns- nature v. man, man v. man, you know the drill if you've watched anything by Hayao Miyazaki. Even the main female lead feels like a Mononoke castoff. The animation is beautiful and despite my issues with the storyline, it's sadly one of the better animes I've watched in the last year or so. If you have an evening to kill, I'd say to go for it. If you're looking for something truly impressive, go somewhere else."
3,Almost something great.,"The music was fantastic, the animation smooth and crisp.The story, to put it bluntly, is lacking. Environmentalists v. Neutrals v. Factory lovers has been done far too much, and this iteration adds nothing new.While beautiful, it is only skin deep I'm afraid."
4,One of the best anime films I've seen,"I'm a big fan of Hayao Miyazaki, and ""Origins: Spirits of the Past"" comes extremely close to the quality and depth of his work. Contrary to what other reviewers have said, I do not share their claims that this ""has been done before"", or as one reviewer said that this was an ""environmentalist commercial"". Neither one is close to the truth. While similar issues have been approached before, none of them have done so in such an original way as ""Origins"" has. ""Origins"" is very original. The characters are very well developed individually and are given very realistic relationships between them. ""Origins"" may not have the spiritual depth of Hayao Miyazaki's work, but it is still an excellent story, well told and produced. Don't deny yourself the pleasure."
4,great rpg for game cube,"this is the second game of the baten kaitos saga but the history takes place 30 years prior to the events of the first game.This game is very good, the combat system is difefernt now and harder to use but that make the game more challenging.This game is much better thant the first because it has a lot of things that the firt didnt have like ""New Game+""where you keep all your magnus in gathering(thank god), secret bosses and more submissions.If you play the first game you may want to play this too because it explains the background of what happened in lost ocean"
3,Equivalent to 40 Watt conventional light bulg,These light bulb gave off brightness equivalent to a 40 watt conventional light bulb when dimmer switch is set at maximum.
4,Robert Bloch's usual demented flair,"This is the 1962 novelization of Robert Bloch's screenplay, written by Bloch himself. As with PSYCHO, this story deals with a most terrifying killer. In this case, the killer murders on impulse. A mental patient, he has no motive, and simply waits for the deadly urge to consume him. It is only then that he picks his victim. Unfortunately for Los Angeles, he has chosen several to satisfy this urge.David Berardelli,author of STEPPING OUT OF MY GRAVE"
5,Great interpretations!!,"This is a very enjoyable cd, my first knowledge of this tenor was with this recording, he has all the feeling. Also the chosen arias are just too sublime to let it pass, so I highly recommend the album... I hope to hear more and more of him ...he doesn't have problems on the high notes like in the italian album so, excelent!!"
2,icemat audio,"Icemat headphone looks cute with hifi look but doesn't seem tobe impressive in the way it functions. Even for a medium volume, it spreads the sound out of the headphone and everyone in the room could listen to it. Not good for working with skype or yahoo ..I spent around 50$ for this headphone but, there are good ones in 25$ range which works better than Icemat eventhough look and feel is not that much attractive as Icemat's."
1,Garmin Nuvi 350 is Discontinued,"Consumer alert: The Nuvi 350 is discontinued. I learned this today from a Garmin support specialist, who was trying to help me solve some technical issues. His software suggestion for the remedy is not available from the Garmin website for this model. I called Amazon, who informed me they have not received any notification from the manufacturer about discontinuing this product, therefore, they cannot alert consumers until they do.It took me 3 hours to download the software. I've spent hours reviewing the PDF manual. Street names are incorrect. Arrival times are way off by hours (the additional software was supposed to correct this.) The most current map will cost an additional $63.99 (DVD). So, I'd say: Buyer Beware!"
4,garmin 350...could be quicker to respond,Quite often it takes a long time to acquire the satelite.I've noticed it has tried to take me to the same place in different directions from the same starting point.While actively using this in downtown traffic going to and from work the charge on the battery lasts approx 1 and 1/2 days and the car charger is already broken.However when it is working it has helped me in a few jams. I've recommended it to friends!!
4,Very Useful GPS,"Since I bought this gadget, it has helped me tremendously in navigating through areas I am not so familar with. It has limited maps from Las Vegas (some areas are not yet listed) but LA is ok. One problem however is that sometimes, it takes you on a circuitous route when you could have taken a shorter way to get to where you are. Having the street names called out (although some street names used are already obsolete) instead of just using distances to make your turns is a very big plus. Overall however, it is a pretty neat gadget and I would recommend it for those who are first time buyers who are not so fussy and who live in big metropolitan areas."
5,Love this one....,This device is cool. During our recent trip to LA/SD we used it all the time and we were very comfortable driving to new places. Only complaint - it didn't identify our house correctly !!
5,Great GPS - No Second Thoughts,Just recently bought the Nuvi 350 - charged it up and went out to the driveway and within a minute it had locked on and had my position. I loaded up a bunch of waypoints (POIs) from ExpertGPS and went for a drive. The unit works great - even if it is a discontinued model - it has the most current maps and with just a few clicks on Garmin's site it has the most current internal software as well.
4,Nuvi 350 is great,We love the Garmin Nuvi 350 - it does exactly what it's supposed to as far as a GPS plus more.Garmin Nuvi 350 Pocket Vehicle GPS Navigator Pre-loaded with v.8 Maps
2,"beware of ""acquiring satellites"" problem","I have owned this unit for about a year now. It's in great physical condition as I treat my gadgets very well :-) It was great when it was working, but it became less reliable after 8 months or so. Now, it is completely useless.For some strange reason, it won't acquire satellites at all, resetting it and re-installing all the software won't help either. I've contacted their support, and the only thing they could tell me is to send in the unit and I'd get charged a $150 ""repair fee"".This is not an isolated problem, you can check out this thread:http://www.fixya.com/support/t387391-garmin_nuvi_360t_find_satellitesIt is really ridiculous that the unit stopped working just after its warranty expired. I will resist from buying any Garmin product again."
4,garmin gps,like it very muchit has a hard time finding coordinates and takes longer then I thought.Other times it's best to use your own head when you already know where you are going as it gives longer routes.
4,Accurate and Fast,"Whenever I miss my exit, this GPS will recalculate a new direction to my destination within split second. I am very satisfy with my new Garmin GPS.Cons:Sometimes if the destination is at your back on the same street, it will ask you to go around the garden to come back to the same street to face the opposite direction instead of asking you to just make a U-turn (which is a lot faster). Not so smart."
5,Love mine!,"I love this prodeuct. Even in the sun and in an area of limited sattelite coverage (yes there are still such places in the US), I find this unit to work well. I just have to turn off the road and re-set the Garmin occasionally. Frequent charging is important, also need to leave home with unit fully charged. I strongly recommend the portable friction mount. Makes a world of difference in ease of programming and ease of use."
1,GPS is Off - don't they test these things?,"I recieved my new nuvi 350 today, and went out to try it in my convertable, top down. With the antenna up, the device contined to display ""GPS is Off"" during my entire drive. The user manual (in the device memory) and Garmin web sit FAQ were of no help. So much for my having a GPS to help me navigate on my trip next week. Doesn't Garmin even test these things before they ship out of Taiwan?Later... Garmin tech support had me try a few things, then told me to return the unit. I recieved a second nuvi 350, which works very well."
4,"Louder, please","The Nuvi 350 ""found"" itself in about 45 seconds in my driveway. The menu was easy to follow, and the mounting device is secure.When recalculating, it occasionally takes odd streets to get back onto course.My main complaint? It needs more volumne."
4,Not Bad But it won't play Iron Maiden,"The concept is great and is all right for listening to talk. But needs improvement in the bass. I tried a cut from an iron maiden album and the distorton was terrible. Garmin might do well to get with Bose and figure out how to make a good small speaker. Also there should be a way to delete the cuts without using an additional computer. If there is, I did not find it.Also, the information on it is out of date. I still wish there was a way to download monthly updates to the data in regards to food, shopping, enertainment, etc. I think that could be a good service and additional source for revenue for Garmin"
4,"Works for me, I'm always lost","I really like the Garmin 350 since I'm always lost in cities or need detours in some cases. Had to convert WMA songs to MP3 but easy enough on computer.One thing I've found, sometimes it takes you a longer way around to a place even though the shorter or faster road has been there as long as the road it takes you on. Haven't figured that out yet."
2,No Owners' Manual & Tech Support,"Following the growing trend, my Garmin Nuvi 350 did not come with an Owners' Manual. This caused problems. The ""Quick Start"" folder supplied gave basic set up & operating instrucitons but few details. I downloaded the 79 page Owners' Manual from Garmin's website and was able to look up answers to a couple of my questions. However, to correct a problem, I had to contact Tech Support. I phoned and was advised by a recording that the wait to talk to a human was 40+ minutes. Having better things to do with my time, I decided to e-mail my question. Within a couple of days I received an e-mail in reply which told me how to reset the Nuvi's settings and correct the problem. Other than these issues, its apparently working fine now. Don't know what someone without a computer would do to obtain an owners manual or seek technical help."
4,Convenient and handy,"The GPS works great for giving directions. It is awesome for help on trying to find a restaurant, hotel, or other places that you need to find. I used it on a road trip from DC to Canada and it did a superb job. The only problem I had with it was that it occasionally had trouble finding the satellite signal when it was turned on. This seemed to be a flaw because simply turning it on and off a few times would fix it."
4,Very pleased,"Came with a free download for updated maps...but it still is missing some newer streets. Overall, I'm very pleased. Easy to use too."
4,Garmin Nuvi 350,"Essential tool for travelers using rental cars and vacationers finding exact locations in unknown cities. I have used my new Garmin even going to places I have traveled to for years, and have found new short cuts through this great tool. One downside was in Canada. I couldn't find exact addresses as easily as in the US. Might be the way I'm programming this device, but don't think so. Still in all, great value and a great tool I will not do without in my travels. Easy to install on windshield and plug-in power cord in any car cigarette portal."
5,excellent purchase,The product is amazing. I cannot recommend it more highly. The delivery etc by Amazon was as always timely and perfect!
5,GPS Perfection,"This was our first experience using GPS and it was well worth what we paid for it. It was easy to use, although a written manual would have been helpful. It informed us of exits and turns early enough to execute them safely, and a few times in case we didn't hear it over our radio. The ""arrival time"" and ""mileage"" was so helpful in deciding when to stop in rest areas."
5,Nuvi 350 is an excellent buy,"I recently purchased the Nuvi 350 GPS after researching GPS units on the internet. It has performed exactly as I had hoped. It is easy to use and gives precise directions. The screen is easily viewable, even in bright sunlight and the verbal directions are clear and loud enough to be heard in heavy traffic. Very pleased with my purchase."
3,Inaccurate Maps,"I have found the Garmin Nuvi 350 easy to use however:1. Maps are out of date. The first two locations I entered returned errors. One was off by several house numbers, the other, Garmin Maps did not even have the area plotted on maps even though the area has been under development for over 3 years and existing county roads in place for a decade.2. I also searched for locations of services in my area and found the info mostly missing or out of date.In conclusion, Garmin needs to update maps and improve accuracy for the product to be trusted in strange areas, and be of real use."
3,"great product, bad company","the good: great product in function. bright display, easy to follow menu, lots of options. plays mp3s decently enough, and even audio books.the bad: unfortunately many people are stuck with old map data. mine came with data from 2005 with no upgrade option. you might be out of luck too without shelling out more for both software and unlock codes for each region.. if you can even figure out which product you need from the webiste.businesses come and go in a single year, imagine how out of sync the data may be after a couple years. selling hardware+software that is so wildly out of date is unheard of in any other industry. i wont sell my garmin unit, but i will definitely give great pause in buying from a company this greedy again."
3,Modest GPS,"Hello,This GPS is supposed to be very nice, so I am assuming the problems are only with the unit I got. But anyway:1. It is pretty insensitive about the current location. It seems to remember the last start location for a long time! This is a BIG problem. E.g. Moving from Point A to Point B, if I start off, and then lose direction in a while, it keeps on telling me the first turn from Point A. I have tried restarting it, giving the end location again, stopping the vehicle, and all such things.2. It may not catch the current location quickly. Whenever I start the GPS, it always shows RED for connectivity no matter where I am standing.Other than this, the GPS is good. It is pretty accurate with algorithms for finding streets, and reconfigures for detour, avoids toll roads, and highways per change in settings, plays MP3, etc.Thanks!"
5,Best of the best for me.,"Have thought a long time before buying one of these, and I must say it is so handy and compact. I use it for even short trips around town and using shortly to drive to Canada. Everyone should at least try it out."
5,Garmin's great,"I bought this for my 19-year-old who was going to be driving from TX to WV by herself. It got her there with no trouble. She was able to locate hotels and gas along the way. No problems, No glitches. Just fast, accurate directions. Exactly what she needed."
5,Nuvi 350 - GPS,"The Nuvi 350 is great! It's user friendly. It enables me to be on time, I am no longer a ""lost sole"". When we travel we can find specialty stores, restaurants... Recommendation - It should have a low battery warning, it just shuts off without warning."
3,Good but not great,"I bought this supposedly top of the line Garmin Nuvi in Dec 2006. Generally I am satisfied with the unit but some simple features are missing.1) The software upgrades only include bug fixes not the maps. So if you received old maps, you will be charged $60 for map updates every year.2) There is no way to save simple favorite searches like McDonalds & Starbucks. You have to type in the search every time you switch screens. This is really irritating.It would be good if these could be saved in favorite searches.3) It would be good if the Starbucks/stores you are looking for are overlaid on the map. They just show you the direction and distance."
4,Hmmmm?,"Although I'm generally happy with this product, it sometimes gives me incorrect locations from where I'm at. I then have to turn it off and restart everything..."
3,works eventually,"This Garmin works eventually. Rapid changes in your location, for example flying to another state and then activating the Garmin seems to confuse it. Several repetitions of turning it off and then back on again seem to solve the problem"
1,this product sucks,"it gets lost all the time, takes forever to load the maps and doesn't tell you when the battery is dying."
3,Garmin nüvi 350 3.5-Inch Portable GPS Navigator,"This product is great if you dont know where you are going, the only negative thing i have to say is the touch screen is very hazy. You can touch the letter A and U will pop you in the display and it happens all the time."
4,Garmin 350 Purchase,"I'm really pleased with the overall product. The company was very helpful about getting the City Navigator 2008 Map Update for me so I'm happy with their customer service as well. There are two small glitches: There has been a little problem with the suction device used to attach the Garmin to the windshield. It does not ""stick"" as tightly as I think it should and I occasionally have to reseat it. It may be due in part to temperature changes because I usually notice it first thing in the morning. The other issue is that both my home and work location are about 2/10ths of a mile off from what the GPS indicates. I don't notice any significant discrepancies anywhere else. In spite of these points, I'm happy with my purchase and wish I had bought it sooner."
5,Great Product!!,I bought this GPS for myself and love it!! Very easy to use and am enjoying listening to 'books-on-tape' and MP3 on it. I've used it to find restaurants in neighboring towns and love being able to drive directly to the location without getting lost. I've since bought one for my parents for Christmas and feel they should be able to use the gadget with ease.
4,"Has flip up antenna, is loud, voice is nice.",Gets great reception. Speaker is loud. Sometimes it seems to tell me too late to turn but recalculate works well. I say always know where you are going and use this as a back up.
5,Another good product from Garmin,"I bought the Garmin C330 2 years ago and loved it. Since the price is now much lower compared to a couple years ago, I decided to upgrade to the Garmin Nuvi 350 so I could have the text-to-speech feature. As usual with Garmin products, I'm very happy. The Nuvi 350 is much more portable than the C330 so it's easier to carry around.When I received my Nuvi 350 from Amazon, it had the 2008 map on it. I registered my unit on Garmin website and received the free update to the 2009 map.As others had mentioned, local retailers are selling this same model for at least $100 more.Thanks Amazon"
3,Great Navigator!!,"This Garmin Nuvi 350 is great and useful for travelling in the city you really have no idea about the direction. I have the wonderful experience to try my Nuvi 350 many times since i 've been travel a lot. However, it is sometimes hard to stick to the front mirror and you have to try at least two times to suck it. .."
5,Wonderful!,"We have been enjoying our new toy since we received it! The directions seem concise and straightforward. The only trouble I had was in an exceptionally messy area outside Washington, DC where I did not find the directions made sense. However there has been years of construction around Springfield and possibly this led to the confusion.Loved the price on Amazon as well!"
4,Great for traveling,"We used our new Garmin on vacation and were able to find gas stations, restaurants, shopping, and more. It was awesome. Not perfectly accurate, it did try to direct us down some roads that didn't exist and even had me at a grocery store where there was actually just a rock wall. But in the scope of how much we relied on it, it was right on most of the time. So glad we had it! We used it with the dashboard mount which was handy too.Garmin Portable Friction Mount for Nuvi, StreetPilot I Series & C530, C550 (010-10908-00)"
5,Garmin Navigational System,My husband and I decided to buy this gift based on our son's recommendation. He has had the product for a year and is very happy with it. He and my daughter in law have been driving to several colleges to look at them for our grandsons and this has come in very handy.We look forward to using it this spring when we plan on traveling.
4,It is usefull but as great as I expected,"My only concern was that, lot of times, when you search for any thing like a restaurant, it will show you some distance but when you run the directions, it takes much longer (sometime more than double) distance to reach there."
5,really great!,"this is a really good product, we have had a lot of fun learning to use it and so far it really has helped us, we live out in the country so when we go to the big city it helps us find things faster..gotta remember that fifth street tho is recognized by 5 street tho on the gps.....and then you are on your way...enjoy"
5,Just a great product,"This is the second Nuvi 350 that I have bought, since I wanted to equip a second car with GPS. I went for the 350 based on my previous experience and the price relative to the widescreen versions. It has text-to-speech which is the one feature that I think is really useful. Operation is very intuitive. It is great."
5,Excellent product,"This is one very worth-my-bucks product, tracking is accurate, screen is crisp and bright, interface is very user friendly and voice commends are clear. The only negative experience with the Nuvi 350 is that sometimes it takes about 1 minute for the settelite to locate the device."
5,Great unit for the price,"I don't know how I lived without my nuvi 350!! It works very well and I highly recommend it. Yes, the battery life could be better but it pays to keep the DC car cord with you. I have nothing bad to say about this unit and, again, don't hesitate to buy one. You will love it."
3,Pretty Good,"I am satisfied with the product, but there could be some improvements. It really doesn't know traffic patterns or congestion and on several occasions it has tried to take me on a route that would have double my travel time. If I didn't know where I was going I wouldn't have had a choice. Alternate route options are minimal if at all.Has a lot of features, good audio clarity and easy to use."
4,Map is not updated to latest,Somewhat is not speedy to use. It takes time to put a data. If I want a new map I had to purchase a new map.
4,Item does not include cradle,"Item was in good condition but did not include the cradle. I've had to buy that separately for another $30 including shipping. Do the math, probably better to buy one of these items new. I only bought it because it will work with my Argent Data System Tracker 2 APRS modem (with an USB to serial adapter cable) Can't test the capability till the mount arrives. There was a snafo on shipping but was FEDEX's problem. They delivered the item but left it in an out of the way spot after allowing a neighbor to sing for it. The vendor was in a bad spot, all they had was the item was signed for so I was left in the lurch, but they did work with me."
5,Works well,"Pros: It works. It's easy to use. It picks up the satellite signals quickly and maps and software are easy to update.Cons: Only one waypoint; battery runs down faster than expected and is longer to charge.The Nuvi 350 is simple to use. You punch in the address or place you want to go, the Nuvi finds out from the satellite where you are, calculates your choice of shortest route or fastest route and shows and tells you which way to go. Other units have more options but are also harder to use."
4,"Good unit, old maps","I previously owned a Magellan GPS, and I find the nuvi 350 superior in all but two regards. First, it doesn't have Bluetooth capability (which doesn't bother me, as my Magellan had poor audio quality). Second, the maps are from 2006. Most times that isn't a problem, but I find it strange that Garmin doesn't provide a free update, given they have the new maps. This simply reminds me that the unit was manufactured a couple of years ago and has been sitting in a box.Garmin, this unit is great, but be a class act and give us the newest maps for free, ok?"
5,"Love the Garmin,","Used it the following week. Took us exactly where we wanted to go. Easy to use. Better than a map. Wish it would tell street names a little slower as sometimes it is hard to understand, but one look is all it takes to varify that you are on the right tract. Recommend it for everyone--this 72 year old loves it."
2,Poorly conceived and gives LOTS of simply wrong directions,"I can't believe the designers of this product have ever tried to use it. Allowing the user to enter the zip code as a shortcut, instead of having to type out the city name each time, would be obvious to an idiot ... but not to the people at Garmin.Yes, 80% of the time, the device is wonderful. But the other 20%? Better stay on your toes for an instruction to get back onto the freeway you just exited, going in the opposite direction, AWAY from your destination. Or turning into a residential neighborhood that is miles away from where you're trying to go.I received these idiot instructions about one out of every two or three trips.BAD PRODUCT - BEWARE!"
4,"Overall, great GPS","This GPS is great, overall. Very simple to use, and assemble right out of the box. My only complaint is that when I attach mine to the bracket used to hold in place, on the windshield...it falls off over every big bump. So, I've resorted to holding it in my lap while I drive, which isn't the way it's intended to be used. I'm going to try to 'modify' it, maybe by using some tacky gum to keep it attached. It easily slips out of the bracket. We use these very same GPS's at work, and I've never noticed a problem with them, so maybe I received a dud? I may get annoyed enough to contact Garmin directly, if my tacky gum idea doesn't work. For a expensive 'toy' like this one, it should stay properly. OTHER THAN THAT, great product!!"
3,well the verdict is still out.,I have found while driving it gives out of the way directions.when i know for a fact there are better routes and quicker ways to the destination.
5,Why Look For a Different GPS???!!!!,"You simply can't go wrong with this GPS. The ""text to talk"" feature is absolutely amazing. It even remembers the names and pronounces them correctly that you input for your favorites. If you miss a turn, it prompts you for the correct route to get back on track. I wish this technology was around when I was in the service and traveled a lot.It is so user friendly right out of the box. You also can't beat the price here at Amazon either. You will not be sorry if you purchase this item."
4,"Good, not great.","We previously owned the Garmin c330 GPS, but only had European maps. The cost of US maps was such that a new GPS made more sense. For appearance, size, etc., this model is superior. However, what counts is the performance itself, and the c330 was better in that regard. The directions were more timely, and the older model just seemed to run more smoothly. Also, we live in a developing area, and the factory-installed maps are already largely out of date. Worth noting--compared to other brands I have seen in action, the Garmin is still the best. So, overall, this Nuvi is good not great."
4,very good product,"This is a very good and reliable product. The only complaint is that it doesn't always pick up the best routes, but it eventually takes you to your destination anyway."
3,Make a U turn when possible,"The Garmin has some funny quirks, and some that aren't so funny. It seems to use the U-turn as the basic navigational maneuver, and it does advise of upcoming turns waaaaay too late to actually make the turn if driving at speed. The address database is woefully outdated. Luckily, the first day I had it I used it to find my way to a movie theater I'd been to before. I drove the route as per usual, and ignored the Garmin's suggestion that I head 18 miles South on the highway when I knew quite certainly that the theater was actually 3 miles North. Yeah, it typically gets you where you want to go just fine, but sometimes it wont."
4,Garmin nüvi 350 3.5-Inch Portable GPS Navigator,"Works pretty well, sometimes it wont recognize when I arrive. Once the address was on a oneway street and it didn't tell me how to get there, in fact it told me it was on the opposite side of the street. But as a whole it is helpful because it calls the street names to turn on and it has a detour which for me is great because I drive in LA."
3,"Great GPS Function but pulling out my hair over ""acquiring satellites"" and the dashboard attachment !","I just bought this product after borrowing it a few times from a friend. In general, I love the size, portability and the GPS functions themselves (and this accounts for the 3 stars on this review).HOWEVER..there are two issues that are really cause for distraction and dissatisfaction:1. In 9 out of 10 cases, it takes a very long time to ""acquire satellites"" - even if I stick the GPS out the window by hand! Interestingly, yesterday I went to a business meeting in a rental car and my colleague brought his own 350 for the trip. We had the same problem with his unit.....2. Every time I get in the car, it is 'hit or miss' if I can get the window attachment secured to my windshield. Just because of this, I somewhat 'dread' each time I have to use the GPS. My wife's solution is to moisten (even 'lick' the suction cup) But c'mon....this can't be right ??!!"
4,Gets you where you want to be,"Overall, I am very happy with this product.It gets you where you want to go, and that's what it's supposed to do, right?It's very easy to use, which is important for me because I don't read manuals. You get you rchoice of languages and voices, which I thought was entertaining and chose to be given directions with an Australian Accent.Every now and then, it makes interesting choices, like leading you off a highway, making a few turns and then directing you back on the same highway for no apparent reason. If you travel with locals, they may point out how wrong the suggested way is, but in the end, it 'knows' where it's going.I only wish you could password-protect the device so you wouldn't risk it being stolen.I like how portable it is, so once it got you to a city, you can pocket it, change its setting to 'Pedestrian' and it will lead you to the sights better than any paper map."
5,Garmin GPS,I purchased this item so my 90 year old mother can listen to audible books.It is an excellent product.
5,Used to always get lost,"For someone that can get lost going to the bathroom in their own house, this unit has turned out to be a life saver.My wife and I have used this on many trips and my Garmin (Jill) has only been confused a couple of times.All of us can find a better way of getting from point A to point B when we are in an area that we are familiar with. It is when we are in an area that we have no idea where you are at and you get that gut feeling that you really should not be there that Garmin really starts to pay for itself, simply press home or your last location and you are out of there.My wife has always been my navigator, and it took a little while before she became a believer, but now we do not leave home with out Jill.I know that everyone talks about screen size . We have found that we hardly ever look at the screen. We almost always simply listen to voice commands and sometimes look for the next couple of turns.Great ProductMerv Hagen"
2,Over priced,"The Garmin Nuvi 350 is over priced, and the sad thing is that 260 has a nice option that is missing here which is to connect to the PC as USB GPS. I can't find a way to customize the map for private roads inside my community. but generally it is OK. a nice thing is that you can send locations (POI) directly from LiveEarth directly to your device. MP3 player is nice I'd like if it had an MPEG4 player as well to entertain my son, and an elecrtonic compass would be a fancy thing to have too :). After using it for a year the speakers cut off."
5,"Great product, great price","I bought this for a Christmas present and Amazon had the lowest price available. My family is thrilled with their gift. The GPS is straightforward to use and has lots of ""extras."" I'm thinking of buying one for myself now..."
4,Working Great,"Pros: Touch screen works great. No directions needed to use. Had no problems getting around with it. Comes with a windshield mount and a case.**ADDED Comment: Another Pro! After 6 months, its still running well as it did when I bought it. No major problems yet.Cons: Battery dies fast if not plugged in. Battery when full might last 2 hours. Takes five to sometimes twenty minutes to find satellites sometimes. Even with the new software download, some roads are not on the GPS.**ADDED Comment: Another Con I seems to have found is, the GPS sometimes freezes up on me. This is very rare, but since I use this GPS 3-6 times every day, after about 6 months it froze up 5 times. After restarting it, it works fine.Overall a 4/5 because of non updated maps, and battery life. I would def. recommend this to friends.Edit: 10/11/08 (more comments)"
1,Disappointing Nuvi 350,"I just returned my Nuvi 350. It was a very disappointing experience with this product.It worked very well the first ten days or so. Then while on vacation in California on my way from Kings Canyon to Fresno, it lost satellite signal. I almost got lost because I trusted it so much that I didn't even bring a decent map with me. It never gained back satellite signal that whole day until I got to the hotel. Ever since then it had very poor satellite reception. Over 90% of time it froze up because of poor satellite signal, no matter it was in cities with tall building or in interstate highways out in the open. It basically became useless since then. I tried reset and even discharge/recharge the battery. Nothing worked.Maybe I just had a bad luck with a malfunctioning unit. Does anyone have a similar experience with your Nuvi?After I returned from the vacation, the first thing I did was to return the Nuvi. I am truly disappointed with this product."
4,Helpful but...,"Garmin Nuvi350 which I purchased 2 months ago is helpful to me in my trips. But some times it misleads. Even when I drive as directed by it, it goes to recalculating, sometimes...and suggests different routes. On one occasion it gave me entirely a wrong direction; when I had to turn left and drive 2 more miles to reach the destination, it gave me the direction to turn right and at .2 miles, it said that I reached the destination. But in general it is helpful. On the safer side better to have a print out of mapqest or google maps. Don't fully trust it."
5,Never Lost Again!,I purchased this GPS for myself. I found it very simple to set up. I bring it everywhere with me. It is small enough to fit in my purse. I find the screen to be adequate in size. I especially love the arrival time feature...I may never be late or lost again! I would recommend this product to everyone!
5,Awesome Product! Great Price!,I love the Garmin Nuvi 350. Uses street names in navigation and works like a charm. Couldn't be happier with this purchase.
1,Unit stopped working suddenly after only two months.,"I purchased the unit in February and it worked fine until last Sunday, when -- in the middle of a trip -- the screen suddenly went blank. Efforts to turn it back on -- via the on button, the reset button, and various power sources -- have all failed. I went to the Garmin web site and clicked the link to secure an RMA number so I could ship the unit to Garmin for repair. After populating all the fields (with serial # etc.) I clicked submit, and I got a prompt that said I was using an unsupported browser. I closed Safari and tried Firefox, repeated all the work, clicked submit . . . and nothing happened. (Just like my GPS unit.) I am going to try to call Garmin tomorrow, but in the meantime DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. If you check out the one-star reviews on Amazon -- and indeed cnet and other ratings web sites -- you will see that this is a common problem."
4,Garmin Nuvi 350,I am totally non-technical and I am thrilled with my Nuvi. It gets me everywhere I want to go and it did not involve any learning curve.
5,Foreign language is not a reason not to buy!,"I specifically chose this navigator for a number of reasons. The ability of learning to use the Nuvi is simple and easy. The cost is very reasonable considering the options it has within the Nuvi. Finally, but not the least important is the ability to translate the directions into several languages of your choosing. My wife is Brazilian and getting lost is better for her to hear her way around in portuguese. She loves it.I reviewed many different navigators and found this one to be the best for the reasons I've listed. Being able to read the reviews on Amazon certainly helped in my decision. I know you'll love it also!"
2,Takes Forever to Connect to Satellites,"I have one of the old odd shaped Garmins and that thing still works great. I tried to upgrade to a Nuve 350, and although the nunit is compact, it takes FOREVER to connect to satallites, sometimes 15- 20 minutes. If your in a hurry to get somewhere, this unit totally sucks. Also, found problems with the speech matching the map directions. Will tell you to go 3.4 miles and then turn, when the graphical shows you turning in 500 feet. I sent mine back to Garmin and they sent me a replacement. Did the same thing. Problem with the model, not the unit. I would say to avoid this unit. Overall, I love Garmin. Their units are miles ahead of the competitors. Very easy to use. However, this model has some big flaws. I would recommend to stay away from this model."
2,not satisfied,I am totally disappointed with the GPS. Everytime I charged it the map that I download it disappears. I can't even put the office where I work although it is 2008 GPS and my office is 15 years in that place. The ad of the seller did not specify the credebility of the GPS. I can't recommend to anyone First time that I was not satisfied with the product from Amazon.
5,Garmin Nuvi 350,"Excellent all around. 3-D map is great to use. Software is friendly and thorough. Changes in course of trip are immediately recognized and the route recalculated, a great advantage. I would like to see some improvement in the car mount system which is a bit awkward when disconnecting or connecting the Nuvi."
5,Nuvi 350 Hits a Home Run!,"The Nuvi 350 is my first GPS unit, but I did a great deal of research before deciding on this model. I'm astonished at how easy it is to use, not to mention its incrdible accuracy. It is wonderful for finding restaurants, hotels, stores, etc. It's easy to punch in an address and the Favorites funtion makes storing locations a breeze. The display is bright and the sound very good for such a small unit. Amazon had the best price I could find, which makes the Nuvi an even better deal, especially compared to the inferior models sold as very expensive options with new cars. This has to be the best unit of its kind on the market."
3,Like it or not?,The Nuvi has the best programming around. It has a great display and gets you where you need to go.Here are the issues:- When I was in the middle of the vacation the screen went white and would not function again. I called Garmin and they were helpfull but they could not get the unit to work.- The Points or Interest are outdated by two years. When I called Garmin again they said that they would sell me a updated POI for $75.00. I don't feel that I should have to own 2 year old software. They had no answer than to cough up the $75.00.I really like the company and the look and feel of the system but I don't like spending this much money for the preceding reasons. I wish they would have been more understanding and allowed one free update. I would still have the unit.So I am looking again but I will ask better questions before buying.
5,Better than I expected,"I love my Garmin. I don't go a lot of new places, but when I do, I am completely lost.I hate map reading, I love the text to voice. I haven't tried the MP3 Part of it yet. I will though. It is a lot of fun to use and very easy to use."
4,Garmin Nuvi 350,"Works very well, but could be more user friendly. I found it hard to find my way through the screens to enter or change information. Could be partly because I've never used a GPS unit before. Directions were easy to follow, and it recalculated quickly when we didn't follow the directions."
1,where is it?,Orderd the item on the 5th of Dec. Was supposed to be here on the 15th. Just checked statis and the delivery day has changed to the 22 of Dec. How long does it take to mail an item from New Jersey to New York? Not 17 days. Would love to review the product but i don't have it yet.
3,"Good product, but not stellar.","This GPS has helped us find new and faster routes to move throughout Michigan to the many places we visit with our business. I with the battery life was longer, I just don't like having the cord dangle down to the cigarette lighter so we can use it for long periods on the road. The MP3 player is mostly a novelty item, not really useful with a car with a CD player, dock for an ipod and good stereo system. It does work, its just not very loud. Also, some of the addresses are off. For instance plugging in our home address takes us nearly 2 miles down the road from where we actually are to an open field. I guess either the map software needs to be updated or something else is going on with it. Other than those snags, it is an excelletn product. Comes with everything you need right out of the box."
5,Garmin GPS,Excellent GPS unit. Was a gift to my brother-in-law and he loves it. Uses it in his business finding addresses.
5,Great Product,"I recently started working in an area I am less familiar with and this has been really helpful. Not only do I get lost far less often, it is helping me learn the area safely. The screen barely takes up any room, the unit is easily recharged, and the voice volume adjustment is wonderful. I got an amazing deal on Amazon; I would not pay full retail. My only hesitation in recommending it to others is that garmin nuvi will come out imminently with incl traffic monitoring, which this does not have and would be a strong added feature."
4,Garmin Nuvi 350 GPS Navigator,I bought this unit in June and used in July and August in Arizona and Nevada. For those who rely on GPS 100% this is an excellent unit. For some areas you need to rely on your instinct because it is not 100% accurate in local. Probably due to 110 degree temperature my suction cup mount cracked and rubber suction cup did not work that well. I had to apply a film of water to make it stick to the windshield.
3,Garmin 350 nuvi,"I just recently received my Garmin 350. It is a very well designed amd made unit. However, I think it is extremely 'CHEAP' on the part of the manufacturer to not supply an owners manual. They have chosen the download from the net method as many others have done. I was expecting a manual from the manufacturer and was disappointed when one was not supplied. I just don't think you should have to do that when you purchase expensive items."
5,Our Nuvis,Among friends and family we have purchased five of the Nuvi 350s. We are all extremely pleased. It is the best value for the money of all the GPS locators available.
4,LOVE IT,I love it b/c I actually can get around without worrying if I will get lost. When I don't use it I always bound to go the wrong way. It is reliable and works well. Hint: if you have trouble mounting it to your windshield just clean the surface with an alcohol wipe and you'll be as good as golden.
4,Can't get lost,"Used on a trip to Dallas, Tx. from Chicago and it performed great. Found restaurants and gas stations and ATMs with no problem. Only missed one turn going through St.Louis,(my mistake) but it recalculated and put me back on track within 1 mile. Only small draw back was I would like to see a better non-glare screen in bright sun. I Recommend this unit."
5,Nuvi 350 is the greatest!,"This new Nuvi 350 has made life easier for a non-technophile! I had a Garmin Street Pilot, but it was very complicated. This one is small, simple to use and just right!"
5,Garmin nuvi 350 GPS Navigator,"This is by far the best bang for the buck I have spent in a very long time. It is an indispensable tool for those on the move and needing to get from point A to B and all points and destinations in between. There are a number of GPS options out there, but after careful research and reviews from many different sources Garmin was constantly and consistently on or right near the top in most categories. Garmin provides a number of different units and for me this little guy provided the most features that I will use at a very reasonable price point. It is easy-to-use and works just great. No more reading maps, printing MapQuests, or asking directions at gas stations. It shows you and it tells you. How easy is that? Get a GPS and get a Garmin!"
1,Not accurate,"The readings are influenced too much by the temperature of the window and the air on the other side of the window. We have a larger thermometer on the back porch that my wife thinks is ugly, so I thought this would be the answer by pressing to the kitchen window. It has stayed up just fine, but it differs from the other thermometer by 10 degrees."
1,junk,"This thing died within 2 days.I changed the batteries and it worked for about 2 hours, then it went crazy and stopped giving a read out.Junk."
2,Not accurate,"While this is small and easy to mount, the temperature is off by ~10 degrees (and as far as I can tell, there is no way to adjust it). And as others have noted, the display is very hard to read in dim light. Disappointing, as all the all ones I see that are mounted by suction cups are REALLY big (I didn't want half of the view outside taken up by a big thermometer!)."
1,worthless,"I cleaned the window, applied the thermometer on a normal temperature day, about 71'F. Within three weeks, it fell off and got so wet, you couldn't read the numbers due to fog in the glass. Eventually it ended up in the garbage before it was 6 months old. In Houston Texas, we do not see hardy winters, so temperature had no negative impact, this is just junk."
4,Not bad for the price,"Those reviewers who suggest that the thermometer is near-impossible to read at night are correct. However I was able to mitigate this considerably by taping a single piece of properly-shaped paper to the back of the display.This causes light from inside of the house to reflect off the paper, essentially backlighting the display. Meanwhile, the paper is translucent enough to let light through during the daylight hours. It's not perfect, but it's much better than out-of-the-box."
4,Temp outside,"For the price, you can't really go wrong with the purchase. Bought it in December and placed it in a north facing window to keep the sun off of it, nevertheless, I feel it may be affected by the warm temp (through the glass) in the house. The reading is never the same as current temps for example at weather.com, and can vary from 1-7 degrees. Difficult, but not totally impossible to read at night. Try it!"
3,Hard to see,"It has a small font, and there is no light. I have to squint and get my head and eyes really close."
2,AcuRite 00799 Digital outdoor window thermometer,"I have now bought 3 of these and two have died within a 6 to 8 month period. :( The third one died a little after a year. I would not recommend this thermometer. Looks nice and great on the outside of the window, just not a product that gives you good service for any length of time."
5,Very profound insights into prayer,"I won't mince words. This Bible Prayer Study Course is probably the finest book on prayer ever written. Rev. Hagin was just that good. This book should be read by every Christian and put on the reading list at every Christian college. Reading it, you understand that many of the prayers long valued in the church - traditional prayers - are not worth saying. They are not effective and, at best, a waste of time. This book is loaded with scriptural insights. It will enrich any Christian's walk with the Lord."
3,Not as cool as the original,"Overall, Inferno is a decent tranformer. Except for turning him into the ""pants"" of a Powerlinx, the transformations are quite easy. As the top of a Powerlinx, he is exceedingly unimpresive. But, after making him the ""pants"" of powerlinx with HotShot and Tow-Lie, he is less trhan impressive, but still works better than some others in ""pants"" mode. I haven't had any problems with durability yet, but perhaps I have an updated mold."
3,Elizabethan Confusion,"As many have already said, this book has wonderful characterization, but for those who aren't really familiar with the way England was during the 16th century, everything can be rather confusing. Finney obviously has an excellent understanding about her topic and characters, but the term ""user-unfriendly"" comes to mind when reading between the lines for some of the plot. In some cases, I found myself wanting to put the book down, but preservering because I was reading it for and Independant Studies class. For those who like to have headaches after they read, and those who study Elizabethan times, this is a wonderful book. Everything is terrifically accurate. But for those who like an easy, clear plot and simple characters without many levels, this is not the book for you."
4,Music that brings a smile to the heart,"I have been fortunate enough to hear Pete Harris play a few times and when he says he loves what he does and it shows, I would agree. It does show.This cd brings a smile to the heart and transports the listener to where there is sun on the face, wind in the hair and sand between the toes... dancing out on that beach.It is very well done."
3,MY UPDATED REVIEW---AFFIRMATIONS,"I had originally said that this was one of the best Affirmation CD's I had ever heard, and it does sound great and all with a narrator with a very nice voice, however, since I am a Christian I feel it's very important to have some Bible scriptures added, such as the Promises of God along with good, positive words of faith to Affirm and speak often. This CD doesn't have any 'scriptures' included and I'm assuming it was intended for people who may be New Age and not Christian, which is okay for them, but I believe that Christians should add Bible scriptures to their Affirmations ALSO. Make sure your spiritman on the inside is getting Enlightened too, and not simply the fleshly mind. But the idea of Positive Affirmations and Decrees Are Powerful to the spirit and your realm of influence, but make sure they get into your spirit too, as the Positive and Wonderful Promises of God will do, if you have (ever) accepted the LORD into your heart."
1,"Billed as ""non-allergenic""? Yeah, not so much.","Based on that description about the oil, I ordered a bottle. When it showed up, it proved to have an ingredient my wife is indeed allergic to (sunflower oil, as it happens), rendering the oil useless to me. A check of the listing showed that the ingredients were NOT listed on the page, making it impossible for me to ever order from this company again. They state that the ingredients might change at any time - but how would I be able to know that it would be safe to use on my wife? Only by ordering a bottle and checking the ingredients on the bottle - at which point, it's too late if it proves to have sunflower oil, wasting my time and money as happened here.If you want to call it non-allergenic, it needs to *BE* non-allergenic."
5,"Great book, great author","I gave this book a 5 because it was a great read. Even though she's a good friend, my take on the book is not biased. The ending was a little lacking, but still pretty good and funny. It is somewhat short, but it is one of those books that you can just read in your spare time. It does take a few pages to actually get an understanding of the storyline, but once you do, it's straight-forward from there. The way Sarah explains things is great. You can actually picture the environments in your head, but there's still room where you can add more to it to your own liking. After finally finishing it, I couldn't help but think that she's got a great road ahead of her to write more. This is a definite must for both young and old!"
3,GIve this one a skip.,"I found very few recipes that appealed to me in this cookbook. The pictures were pretty and the directions were easy. However, many of these pasta sauces just didn't sound good- for example, there quite a few that required anchovies (yuck) and others that required equally yucky types of food that I don't generally like to eat. I think you can find other cookbooks available that have better recipes. I'd skip this one."
1,Army Wives season 4,Absolutely love the show and have all seasons...Very disappointed in season 4 the copy I received is in poor conditionThe last disc does not play...It appears to be empty and the disc prior to that skipped and froze...Very Very disappointed. I expected much better from Amazon Services.
1,ONE DOG TOO MANY,I AGREE WITH THE CRITICAL CUSTOMER REVIEW THAT IT DID NOT SEEM TO BE WRITTEN BY THE SAME AUTHOR. I AM SORRY SHE IS DEAD AND NOT AROUND TO RECTIFY THIS DOG OF A BOOK.
2,Flimsy and Barely Usable,I bought these at the local hardware because they stopped carrying the Rutland brackets. They are so flimsy that its almost impossible to get them together because the tiny screws they supply keep popping out and the various crosspieces and uprights come loose. It was a delicate operation to get it in place without have the whole thing collapse. Not sure if it will actually hold firewood.Bottom line: buy the Rutland brackets. They are worth the extra money.
3,Where's the mask,"I bought this figure with the assumption that it came with Wolverine's mask, since it does say ""with mask"" and it is pictured with the mask. So if you really like the mask, or you have to have the mask, then I suggest you don't buy this figure. Other then that, the art work is great, and I like the way they made wolverines face look. They did a good job. Although, I don't really think I would have purchased it if I knew that it didn't come with the mask. Someone really needs to look into that."
1,poor,The cable I received would not fit into any of the recepticals on the camera. It was not the correct cable.
4,christmas gift,Bought this for the grandsons for Christmas. They are having a blast with this especially since they also have the safe.
5,Great,This was just what I needed. I have been looking for a rain gage and this one is really easy to read. My 4 year old loves dumping it out after a rain.
3,Good for two or three years,"As others have said, its good for a couple years before the plastic dis-colors and becomes basically unreadable.Plus the plastic spike can break if you have hard ground.But hey, its plastic, for 8 bucks, not too bad. Just buy a few extra and keep them in storage. Seems to be the best option.Glass... unless located some where safe can break too easily and it needs to be kept clean too."
2,Plastic not Durable,"Easy to read even from inside the house. But I forgot to empty it, the water froze over night and the back cracked. Nice but not durable."
5,"Powerful, Beautiful, and Moving","""Woman, Space, and Love"" by gifted poet Zuzana Pikova is absolutely beautiful. Zuzana's rich and modulating voice is perfectly complemented by the melodic strains of accomplished musicians Joe Yamada and Todd Houghton. It's the type of CD that you want to listen to with the lights out, candles burning, and your head resting on the back of the sofa!"
5,Wonderful!,"This item was purchased for our house. We own the BAND OF BROTHERS VHS box set and have viewed it so many times, some of the tapes no longer play. Excited to get the DVD box set in the house and have wanted to watch THE PACIFIC. In my opinion, BOB is better than THE PACIFIC but both are truly wonderful series. I would recommend this set to anyone. Likely, if you enjoy BOB, you'll like THE PACIFIC. Spend the extra money and get the set of both, we're glad we did!The case is sturdy and opens to reveal a solid ""book"" of DVDs. Package does not easily fit in with most DVD holders but fits well on a shelf. Easy to find amongst our collection of DVDs."
5,Definate Chart Topper,"This CD was GREAT! Live comedy done so well, you'd think you were sitting in the audience. Total side-splitting laughter from start to finish. A must own for anyone who loves great comedy or your collection is not complete."
5,i love the b-sides!,This CD is an excellent effort and final product :). You don't like it? Get your ears checked.
4,a great cd,"this is a mad hot cd. the only reason i didnt give it a 5 is cuz the second half of the cd can get boring. i recommend this to any fan of west coast hip hop, or any fan of hip hop at all"
5,best of the year,dj quik is very good on this cd... he is a lyrical master..masta produca..well here are the best songs1. Come 2 Nite2.Trouble3.50 ways4. Get Loaded5. Gina Statuatorre
1,An ordeal to read,"I thought at only 256 pages this book would be a quick read. Instead, it has about 40-50 pages of interesting information followed by either total repetition of previous information or extremely simplistic musings. (I hate not finishing a book, but this one was like reading a incoherant text book,"
5,Hot Big Band jazz,"A tremendous contribution to the Big Band jazz tradition, this CD proves that the genre is still vibrant and meaningful for today's musicians and audiences. Two thumbs up - outstandingly tight performances all the way around."
5,Great Cookware,This heavy and easy to clean pot is a size that is often called for in my kitchen. I bought a second for my home and one for my vacation home.
3,"Great Sync, Awful soound","I bought this dock, mostly to plug the ipod into my speakers, but the sound quality is awful, besides you can't control the volume from the ipod."
4,Bravo!,"I am an American living in Italy. I found this book last year, read it and couldn't forget it. There were some truths that scared me. I am rereading it, underlining, making notes and enjoying it even more. I fouond WHEN NIETZCHE WEPT an intelligent, inventive and engrossing novel. Bravo, Signor Yalom."
3,"Great idea, average writing.","An ingenious idea, to have Nietzsche work with a doctor undergoing a midlife crisis, and to have Nietzsche analyze him. The doctor represents a common midlife everyman, and Nietzsche's analysis of it is insightful.But the writing is average. The author doesn't have strong skills in creating believable dialogue. Every! sentence! ends! with! an! exclamation! point! I have never read a book with so many exclamations!Since one of the characters is Nietzsche, readers will fill in. But if the author had tried to create a brand new character, the book would have fell flat.If you like Nietzsche, you'll like this novel."
1,Disappointed: Censored,I had this pre-ordered but now learning that it's censored is making me cancel it. I agree with my fellow movie lovers that Disney shouldn't try to remove historical content from a film from a different era that had different values in order to be politically correct for today's values. I hope they don't start going on censoring spree and start removing and editing out content in future re-releases. God forbid they remove or edit scenes like Bambi's mother or Simba's father dying or even black crows from Dumbo.
5,Without all the technicalities of the movie itself,"The package came just as it would at the store. If you are worried about buying online, you shouldn't with this product. It had all the inserts/ pockets/goodies. All disks worked just fine."
3,Fantasia,My son liked the 2000 edition better than the original. The original bored him. He is 14 years old.
1,Find the original release on VHS,"Even though you will not have the film quality of DVD, find the original release on VHS if you want uncensored content."
4,Classic film the original but POOR DVD PACKAGE,"What has happened to Disney Video?They are just making so many mistakes.The original film was the reason I purchased this. I already had it on VHS, laser disc & DVD.Disney did NOTHING special with this package.The back of the DVD promotes the films, sights, animation. Colorful films BUT WE GET PLAIN JANE SILVER DISCS. VERY cheap Disney.No special extras. Disney should have done something special here for the 70th anniversary of the original film. Nope, nothing here.I believe Disney is just favoring blu/ray releases. NOT EVERYONE HAS BLU/RAY I DO NOT They are more expensive, the machines more expensive.Cheap, a disappointment for Disney fans."
1,Harmony Gold is really pissing off the fans....,"first off, the computer animated space scenes look like they were made on a Commodore 64 computer.....second, we ALL know that they are going to release a special edition on dvd, then another on blu ray.... then another special edition, ultimate edition, supreme edition, paramount edition.... etc.....WTF!!! this makes me so mad because instead of MILKING this movie (don't misunderstand, the movie is great), they should concentrate on MAKING A NEW SERIES, OR MOVIE SERIES OR ANYTHING!!!!!!!When Harmony Gold gets their act together, then I will be just as big a fan of Robotech as I ever was (I was HUGE!)the movie gets 5 stars, but the way the franchise is being handled gets zero stars!!!don't make us wait another 500 years like the period after the whole Sentinels debacle..... I love all things Robotech, but enough is enough....."
1,And they continue to butcher great originals...,"This complete work of rabble should have never seen the light of day. Having to witness another poor example of anime butchery should have been a wake up call to the generation who grew up watching poorly dubbed and savagely edited Japanese animation. ""Robotech"" should have stayed in the past were it belongs. The only good it ever did, we hope, is to open a world of foreign anime and cinema to the western set. By all means skip this one, do yourself the favor and watch the originals (unedited, uncut, and in original dialogue). You just might discover what a growing number of anime buffs are slowing coming around to: Original and Untouched is always superior and unequal."
1,Robotech rulz~~!!!!,"Robotech rules... and this movie is VERY good...EXCEPT... the computer animation is TERRIBLE>>>>>they need to get a grip on it, or else they will destroy this franchise...I love Robotech!!!!"
1,Horrible,"The story didn't make any sense; story development and dialogues are mundane and borning. The character and mecha designs are second rate at best... The animation is definitely a poor imitation of the true Anime style. I only gave it 1 star because Amazon required it. ( I wish they gave me the choice of a -5 stars) I might have enjoyed this if I was a 5 year old... On second thought, no, I think I was much smarter than that even when I was 5."
3,Wish it could be more......,It did not answer many questions but open up many more questions about Robotech story.
3,Love and Hate,I love the Original series and purchased this item to finish my collection. This add on is not very good it lacks the feel and draw in appeal of the original. I'm sure others will like it but the computer slap on art work just didn't mix well for me and it didn't appeal to my artistic side. Would I want it anyway? of course - it completes a great series.
5,Awesome next gen graphics,I absolutely loved this move. It ties everything together from the ending of the Robotech saga. The story line is continuaous. Characters and voices (many are) the same. But what really sets this one up an order of magnitude is the CG artwork and fluidity/detail of the video. It just POPS!! Super sharp. I really like the characters and it really does tidy up all those pesky questions that lingered at the end of the Robotech trilogy. I got this video new and it shipped quickly and in great shape. Outstanding purchase. I'm very pleased.
5,Video Violence 1 @ 2,"Video Violence 1 has a good story to it and well executed. I love seeing a video store with vhs tapes, something I grew up with. It has lots of gore and the meat slicer part was probably one of the best scenes i've seen in awhile. After seeing many horror fans rave about this, I can see why. A must own for horror buffs.Video Violence 2 is one of those sequels that takes what people enjoyed from part one and shows it more. Homer and Eli now have there own tv show and it's pretty entertaining and sick. It's not as good as part one but still very fun to watch.Overall, a must have for any horror fan. Two great movies for one low price and plenty of gore."
4,AWESOME!!! -11 yr. old,"I enjoyed the XP-6 Watch, and the motion activated system is tight! Of course it's not made for education but it is made for FUN!!! Except there were only a couple flaws: every time I wash my hands with it, it malfunctions and needs to dry out (I sorta forget sometimes). You also don't want it in your backpack because it'll probably lose a button (happened to me) and I sorta bump a certain button sometimes which changes the World Time (I'd rather have to hold a set button first). But I still LOVE it! You can hide it somewhere and whenever someone tries to take your stuff: ERERERERERERRERERE!!!! The motion activated system even records when the beep was activated! I love it! So overall, I think it's pretty radical."
4,spy watch,"i liked it while it lasted but its not very durabe and its bulky and it cannot be in water AT ALL (it busted after a little drizzle, left it outside)"
1,Nice Idea but it doesn't work...,Got this for my daughter for Christmas. I set the time but left it on the kitchen counter because she wasn't ready to wear it. Next morning it was dead!!! I tried the reset button and it came back on but had lost all the time settings I'd done. I set it again and same thing a few hours later. The battery isn't dead because the flash light still works.It's a great idea but there's something wrong with the battery/electronics. This gadget is going back to ToysRUs tomorrow!!
4,"Same Homeland, Same Heartbeat","I know the land she writes about - every tree and creek in Cherokee country - for it is the place of my birth, too, and her lovely memories are as true as my own heartbeat. I even knew her beloved Papa. I write about this same land in my own book of memoirs ""Sometimes A Wheel Falls Off"" (Hawk Publishing Company.) Joyce Hifler wrote a blurb for my book, saying it is ""deep and dear and so touching that I want more of it."" We have the same homeland and the same abiding reverence for ordinary, holy place. She leads the way in telling this story."
3,"Great game, but completely irrelevant thanks to the sequel","Super Swing Golf is an entertaining game, to be sure, and when it first came out, it might have been a great idea to buy it to get a golf fix on the Wii (assuming you had enough of the holes in Wii Sports).However, Tecmo did something very few companies do - they made a sequel that includes all the content from the original.Most sequels have lots of all-new stages and characters and such, with maybe a handful brought back from a past game, but in Super Swing Golf Season 2, you get everything the original game had, and then some, making this first game in the series entirely irrelevant.There's really no reason to own this one once you have the sequel, unless you're one of those nutty completionists who has to own every game in a series just for the sake of owning it."
1,Just a childs game,"I guess it should have been obvious that this was a kids game, but for some reason I missed it. But as soon as you open the instruction booklet - ""The island of Pangya has been invaded by an evil force, and only the mysterious PHOENIX ORB can save them. But, the orb can't be touched by human hands, so the magicians created the AIR LANCE SET to move the orb from place to place."" You get the idea.I was hoping for just a simple golf game - I really like the Wii Sports Golf. Simple golf, nice graphics, very playable. Alas, this kids game is not what I was looking for. I've tried the Tiger Woods golf games, but there are dozens and dozens of unique ways to customize each shot there, and it takes forever to play. Can anyone recommend a game that is essentially the Wii Sports Golf, but is more than 9 holes? Thanks."
3,"Good sales pitch, but lightweight","Don't get me wrong - I think Goldratt's ""Critical Chain"" idea is great! This book does a good job on selling the idea. However, if you want to really understand the idea in enough depth to apply it, you need more than this book. I'd recommend Newbold's ""Project Management in the Fast Lane"""
3,Good but too wrapped up in fable,"The points this book makes are great - once you wade through the ""fable"" part. The rambling discussions of the characters often makes it hard to focus on the concept being discussed. The key points could have been covered within a chapter if all the fluff was cut. That said, the concepts are useful - as is the concise summation of ""The Goal"" offered by one of the characters."
4,Wonderful Novel,This is a wondeful business novel. We are repeating some of the benefits from this novel in our company.
1,13 winters CD,"Poor recording quality and annoying vocals. This Band has true potential to sound great. The violin is the best part of the CD, but the rest of the instruments are poorly played."
3,"Nice, but pricey!","I've tried all different types of bike computers, and this, to me, was going to be the holy grail. Although the price is very high, it has a lot of functionality that I wanted. One really cool thing is that it gets coverage everywhere. I went to one place where my older eTrex never got coverage, and this worked flawlessly.One downside is the heart rate monitor. Despite the fact that this device supports HRMs, it doesn't support the HRM standard, which means you need to buy the special Garmin-made HRM strap, which costs over double the price of other ones. You may ask Why, like I did, and the response is that this is a one of a kind device. Bad answer. The obvious one is ""We want to make more money by marking the price up by 3000%!"". Oh well, it is a neat device."
4,Pfaltzgraff Circle of Kindness Lamb Pie Vent,"The Pfaltzgraff Circle of Kindness Pie Dish with Lamb Pie Vent is clever and cute. It's a nice contrast to the typical pie bird, and its presentation makes it appropriate for dessert or meat pies. The glazing is simple but pretty. It's a great way to keep your pies from bubbling over."
3,"Good read, will change no minds","An easy read and enjoyable, but hardly earth shaking.The bulk of the book basically says ""Creationist are idiots and liars, and everyone should know that by now"" but with some tact, and with some examples.The last chapter basically says, ""we're destroying the ecosystem, and only religion can save us,"" Without much to back it up."
1,Doesn't make its point. What caused the 'divine spark?',"There is plenty of evidence for evolution, but without conclusive proof of the 'divine spark' that seperates living cells from the rest of nature, creationism is a better theory than evolution when detailing the beginnings of life on EarthI was disappointed that Eldredge was writing a political book rather than a purely scientific discussion. Certainly, creationism has been used by various religious and political forces for their own means. But I am looking to read something that conclusively proves one theory or the other, without regards to the politics. The holy grail of evolution studies will be an experiment that replicates the process by which life pulled itself out of the mud. So far, nothing has come close. Until someone is able to honestly replicate this process, the creation theory is just as valid as the evolutionary theory.-- JJ Timmins"
3,A weak contribution to the Evolution/Creation debate,"I was looking forward to reading this book when I ordered it. However, I was very disappointed in it once it arrived. As a professional biologist and an evolutionist, I found Elderidge's arguments weak and unconvincing. He missed many modern examples of transitional species such as feathered dinosaurs like Protoavis. At times, his argument seems too passionate for scientific discourse. I also got the impression that this book was an advertisement for his up-coming book on ""god"", which he mentioned at least 5 - 10 times throughout the text. I guess I expected more from one of the ""big names"" in the field."
2,You pay for what you get,"Though this clock has a low price, it is of equally low quality. The first one I got did not keep time at all - the second hand moved, but the minute hand would only go around once, and then stop until it was pushed forward again. I sent it back and got a replacement, which seemed to work fine for a few months, but lately it has been displaying similar symptoms."
2,"It works on the mac, but barely","It works, but it's really slow and not all of the features function properly when you're trying to do specific things, especially with employees. It constantly hangs up, and if you're trying to make some changes to something when it does, a couple extra clicks because it's not responding, and then you have a bunch to fix once it does catch up. I'm interested in finding something like this, but that works properly."
1,"Fun game, if you can get it to work","Tons of attractions, shops, scenery, and fireworks all at your fingertips and waiting to be used in the ultimate theme park, if you could only get the game to work. Unfortunately the game suffers from multiple crashes that occur unexpectedly and without much warning leaving you little chance to save your progress. Were it not for the extreme bugginess of the game I'm sure it would be great, however, as of right now the amount of crashes make the game unplayable."
5,Excellent condition,"This book arrived in terrific condition. There was a re-release under a new title, and the original version was hard to find, so I was very glad to see that I got exactly what I was looking for and that it came in such great shape."
2,Slow,"This thriller moves very, very slow and is constantly sidetracked by meaningless subplots. What is the point ? Where is the story ? Where were the editors ?"
3,Slow moving piece about police in Paris,"This is a slow, slow movie what takes 3/4 of its length to build a case for its explosive conclusion. We see police station in one of the Paris districts that deals with typical big city crimes: drugs, rapes, murders. In the course of the film we learn that cops involved with these crimes are not immune to them either. They have problems of their own and that leads them to drinking, slacking and even marijuana smoking on occasions. As the female chief in charge of this group deals with her own demons upon return to her duties from her 2 year sabbatical, she bonds with the young rookie cop who has transferred from suburbs to the city in search of the excitement of the real police work. As his thrill turn tragic within the first month of his new job, his new boss dedicates her energy to finding and punishing criminals responsible for his downfall."
3,It's not like the website photo,"We ordered two of these utensil holders. Neither had the Emile Henry logo embossed on the outside. The website photo shows the logo, but there's not one. So if you want a utensil holder with the logo, look elsewhere. Otherwise, it's a real nice looking holder, plenty large and stable enough for utensils."
2,not what i expected,"The product came in very well packaged and secured but as soon as I took it out, i knew I was going to return it. First off, it wasn't as heavy as I would have liked but what bothered me more was that the color had a cool grayish tint when i was expecting a true white. If you're familiar with BM paint colors, I would compare this to a darker Decorator's White. if you have a Kohler Whitehaven sink in white, this color would look bluish gray next to it."
1,An EMBARRASSING attempt,"Ernsberger might as well have written about women's volleyball in the SEC since he's got at the very least 10 factual errors that I uncovered. Calling Kevin Faulk ""Marshall"" Faulk twice and Nick Saban ""Lou"" is unforgivable and that is why he gets a big NEGATIVE from me. I am a big Bama supporter as well and I found his commentary regarding the Capstone to be orange-biased.Maybe Mr. Ernsberger should be wearing convict orange on the cover? Don't bother folks. Save the $ for tickets."
3,Man is this bad,"What a disgrace to the country's finest football conference. Ernsberger may as well be cheeseburger...Calling Kevin Faulk ""Marshall"" doesn't give this book much credibility. Besides, it reads like a TN alum wrote it. If you're into the SEC like I am try ""A Tailgater's Guide To SEC Football"". It's a good read on the entire SEC. Again, Ernsbeger should be drawn and quartered for this sacrilege. Go Gamecocks!"
4,Well done coffee table knife book,"This is a collection of color photos of knives from around the world and of the last 200 or so years. As a knife collector and seller I will buy any book with knife and collectable in the title. I am usually rather harsh on books that aren't what they should be. This is not one of them. Nice pictures, most completely doped (the background is white) so there is nothing to compete with the knife. Nothing in here about collecting, buying, selling or values. Any custom knifemaker should have one of these, there are a bunch of good ideas in there. Having this book can save you tons of money travelling to museums both here and on the continent; which of course you can spend on more knives. I didn't find anything in this book that I wouldn't want to own."
2,Terribly disappointed,"Was extemely disappointed with this comforter. I was so anxious waiting for it to arrive. I have bought cheaper ones that were better than this one. There is no way this is 700-750 fill power and I wonder about the thread count. Even after putting in the dryer to fluff it out, it was still flat as a pancake. I will be returning it after I find out how."
5,Dad and the kids love it,"The Rough Thyme has a wonderful flavorful smell. The kids picked it (sniff test) over the other Kiss My Face Bath Gels and marvel over the ""little rocks."" It makes a great bubble bath and I love it as a shower gel."
3,This book had an editor? Where?,"I completely agree with Efrem about the editing, or lack thereof. Aside from the errors Efrem mentioned, I also noticed that there seems to be a lack ot European cultural knowledge, e.g., the Irish are associated with shamrocks (not four-leaf clover) and the carved wooden horses (if the author means Dala horses) are Swedish (not Danish). In addition, although I do like the Benni Harper books for the stories and the interplay of the various regular characters, cannot at least one of them speak in standard grammatical English? Several of them have university educations--some people come out of school knowing when to use who and whom, lie and lay, I and me, etc., but evidently no one in San Celina. In at least one place (I wish I could find it now) the wrong word was used--it had a similar sound but an *entirely* different meaning. These things make reading a chore, not fun."
5,Starting Your Life Over,"Individual Power explains what 'individual power' is all about, gives you the authors experiences along the way, and teaches you how to start over in life.It's written in three parts, 'personal empowerment', 'empowering society at large', and 'spiritual evolution'. Each one is unique with good insight in each of the three parts.I like the authors writing style, you can tell she knows what it's like to hit bottom and start over again.She advocates for the people from her heart in a clear, objective manner. Something we could use more of in our world."
5,A Phenomenal Read. Truly Enlightening!,"Individual Power brought me genuine enlightenment from the words that were written in such a way that they struck a cord within that really needed to be re-examined with respect to my life, and all facets of it. Barbara Rose did an outstanding job of relating, sharing, and bringing through divine messages that have already had an impact on my life. Through this book I was inspired, and understood. I was given practical solutions from my relationships, to my career, my place in society, to my spiritual growth. This book flows, and is more than a superb read.It is a book that has genuinely helped me begin to transform my life. HIGHLY Recommended!"
4,New Coralife Actinic Bulb,"I was a little skeptical about purchasing this item after reading only one other review for this item in which the user stated that the bulb they got was not actually any actinic bulb.I am happy to report that after taking the plunge I am very happy with my purchase. I purchased the item via amazon prime and received a 36watt, straight 4pin Coralife branded bulb that is in fact the Full Actinic bulb. I am not sure what happened in the other review that said the bulb they received was not actually an Actinic bulb but that wasn't the case for me. For anyone who is wondering this is the replacement bulb used in the Biocube 29gallon stock hood, it fits and works perfectly. The bulb was also very well packaged by amazon in both bubble wrapping and lots of packing material protecting the bulb. I'll definitely be purchasing this item again in the future and appears to be the best deal around on these bulbs."
1,Very unhappy,"I thought I would really like this bra. It look so light and airy. But, when I got it, it look so cheap, considering it cost $34.00. So, I wasn't happy with any of the Breezies Bra's that I bought."
1,No potential what so ever,"This CD lacks almost everything. dont believe me? go ahead buy it you'll understand. i heard the demo, the first two songs are not bad and then the rest is like they just kinda gave up on the CD and put it out for people with no taste of music to buy. Very poor quality sound and just needs help before they humilate there self even more. I suggest Projest 86 if u want a good Christan Band. Or Factory 81."
1,Disappointed,"I think the world of what Pat Croce has accomplished but this book is beneath him.It was co-authored and I wonder just what part Croce played in the writing and content. Reading it I had the feeling I wasted my money, finishing it I had a feeling of great disappointment. I read a lot of motivational books and this is a light weight. Purchase his first book it was a lot better."
4,Real history with all the warts,"This is a middle volume in an eight-volume set of books which exhaustively covers the many origins and history of the Civil War from 1847 onward. For any student of history, it is invaluable in its coverage of the roots of the war and its conduct. This volume deals with the haphazard beginnings of the war in North and South when both sides thought that the war would be brief, and -- so to speak -- fun. Obviously that was a triumph of romanticism and fanaticism over logic; the truth was bloody and protracted. Despite the author's tendency toward lengthy sidebars, this is valuable history, fairly well written. Nevins could have used an editor, but so could most acedemics. This is worth the price, but consider reading the earlier volumes first."
5,Great band! The Reverend always gives it his all.,Great CD. Also check out the Reverands other bands -Arch Demon Choir and Splatter Pattern.R.I.P. Kev. You will never be forgotten...
4,Excellent CD,This is a wonderful album of Gypsy Jazz in the style of Django Rinehart and Stephane Grapelli. All of their albums are supurb.
3,wide angle lens h5,"I bought this lens for my h5, its pretty good but there are dark rings in the corners. Zoom in and move back to fix that. The macro lens that is included is really good as well. but you have to zoom in. I suppose that for the price you really can't beat it."
1,Weird feel to them...,"I hate these bags. They are made of this weird plastic that doesn't move well, and is super crinkly and squeaky when you twist the bag at the end. Not sure how else to describe it. The seams are also kinda big which makes it feel strange holding the bag, and hard to keep a tight twist and keep the icing in the bag and off of you. Yuck....wish I didn't have 100 of them to use up."
4,Great disposable bags,These bags are just the right size and are very strong and durable. They held up well to repeated filling.
2,"Very, very basic book","Upon receipt of this book I was very, very disapointed.If you are looking for a collection letter book that gives solid, indepth letters that include FDCPA tags and other inportant collection letter information, this is not the book to buy.The letters are very basic (people with zero experience might find this to be a starting point) and it glosses over many topics. OR does not address them at all. (If you need letters for accounts more than 90 days past due -- there is no help here.)I will be very wary of what I buy on Amazon based on this experience. If you are doubtful about buying it -- don't!"
2,Nothing happens...,"Gosh, but this was a boring story. It started off well enough, with Mrs. Drew's brother-in-law making an ungentlemanly offer when his brother, the vicar, dies. Lord Winn, divorced and persona-non-grata with the Ton and the owner of the property she finds to rent, is immediately and utterly charmed by her and her daughters. Nothing happens in this story, other than a lot of walking from here to there with Lord Winn coming to the rescue for every little thing. Mrs. Drew even tosses up her cookies at the mere ""misunderstanding"" that Lord Winn is talking about not allowing her to stay on as a renter. The conflict dies after the first chapter and all we have left is these folks doing and saying nothing of substance. There is no building up to anything. They just seem to immediately love each other.This was the second story I've read by Carla Kelly and was equally disppointed. With so many high marks I was hoping for a page turner. I won't purchase another by this author."
2,Too limited.,"Not suited for any business that does much volume or has employees. The ads didn't clearly tell me I couldn't add Payroll over this version. Ended up having to buy the full Quickbooks anyway, wasting money."
3,better information in the Vault guides,"In my opinion there is more and better objective information on Finance and investment banking careers in the Vault Career Guide to Investment Banking and in the Vault Guide to Finance Interviews, which have the added benefit of being able to be purchased on vault.com and downloaded immediately. Good luck."
2,Can't remove sticker gunk,"Love the bowl, don't get me wrong. However, I have the whole set and only this one has sticker gunk that will not come off. I've tried goo-gone and soap and alcohol and soaking it and putting it in the dishwasher. The sticker gunk is beyond my control, and it drives me crazy!!!"
1,Good Grip on the stickers!,"Love the bowl, hate the stickers. Not sure who to blame for that, but it took me ages to get the stickers off the bottom and sides of my bowl! A little reworking of their labeling is in order."
5,Great Kitchen Accessory!,I can't express enough how much I love these bowls. They have great grip and are big enough for any size project if you get all three. They are a little pricey for mixing bowls...but well worth the purchase in my opinion. The insides do get scuffed up with mixer use...but this I expected with stainless steel. I recommend these for the bakers out there!
5,Doing it right.,"""What do a tomato and a potato have in common?""This horror piece is chilling, suspenseful, and surprisingly thought-provoking.Never will I look at a baby monitor the same way again.Excellent, excellent, excellent. I am looking forward to checking out other titles in this collection."
4,Wonderful Pictorial!,"This book has been a wonderful addition to my library. As you are investigating new plant selections, you can see what these plants look like in this book. Those latin names take on real form! It is a perfect companion to my Western Sunset Guide. This book has a few limitations which the Sunset Guide remedies. The ""A-Z"" usually doesn't mention the negative aspects a plant may have ""agressive roots, etc."" and the hardiness zone map on the back is small and it may be difficult to place exactly where you live. In all other areas it seems to be a great book - lots of ideas for special areas, pruning methods, etc. Enjoy!"
5,ENTRE HERMANAS,BYANKA SIEMPRE HA SIDO MI CANTANTE FAVORITA Y DESEO OBTENER TODOS LOS DISCOS DE ELLA. LOS QUE SEAN YO SE LOS COMPRARE.ESPERO ME ENVIEN MAS INFORMACION DE MI ESTRELLA QUE ES BYANKA.
3,Not Professor Engel's best,This did not live up to Professor Engel's other DVDs. I use the Poe DVD in my English classes and was hopeful that the Mark Twain would be as good - but alas - it was not.
3,Killer robots go Gallagher on on humans,"The movie has an interesting premise, but I didn't find it captivating. The special effects were decent -- reminded me of SyFy's Battlestar Galactica. Fan's of this movie will like Robocop."
5,I LOVE DANCE MAG!,Every Dancer would love Dance Magazine. The stories are intresting and cober all aspects of diffrent types pf dance. And the information given really helps dancers stay healthy and strong! I love Dance Magazine.
1,leave the singing to real singers....,"this girl just doesn't cut the mustard when other talented singers are working hard everyday to keep their careers going. after hearing this song, i can see why she didn't get a record deal until a couple years later...."
2,Not that funny and a little depressing.,"I thought this book would be fun to read, but I found it to be poorly written and a little depressing. It was a disappointing book, especially since it had the potential to be very funny.The book was depressing, because she seemed so miserable through 3/4 of the book. I would not recommend this book."
2,''You'll Never Nanny In This Town Again'',I was really looking forward to reading this book but i was very dissapointed with it.There's no really funny parts in the book and not so many famous people as i expected.
5,Yes it works!,"I have been using Chaser for years and telling everyone I know about it! You must follow directions, take it before and throughout a ""celebration"" and drink water. During the holidays my sister-in-law was hitting it pretty hard and I said, ""Won't you be so hung in morning?"" She proceeded to announce, ""I never get hangovers, I take Chaser!"" She forgot she was speaking to her adviser from years past! Sometimes people don't believe at first, become a believer because Chaser works. Another little tip: I always keep AntipoleezAnti-Poleezlozenges in my car. These things ROCK! After a night of drinking, no worries if you get ""stopped"". Pop 2 immediately and roll down your window with confidence!"
1,Millenium rip off,I thought this was a regular dance party CD which I usually love. This has only two songs by the original artists! Can you imagine Genie in a Bottle not by Christina Aguilara! Don't waste your money.
2,It's okay,Before I ordered the Staple Free Stapler I read several reviews and thought this would be a neat little gadget to have on my desk at work. Once I got the stapler and tried it out I was very disapointed in it. Some reviews stated that the papers stayed together and it worked great. With much disapointment I found my papers did not stay together and it actually takes more time to use then a regular stapler.
1,About as good as a dollar store gadget.,"This functions, sometimes. It's curious and gimmicky. I prefer useful and dependable. It punches out three sides of a little flap and a little slit. After you remove the paper from the gadget, you tuck the flap into the slit. Much of the time, when you pull the paper out of the stapler it rips off the little flap, leaving nothing to tuck. Maybe on a day of severe boredom and lots of practice with scrap paper I could master this little thing, but I don't see it ever replacing my trusty Swingline."
2,Ok for only a few pages,"I bought it for the office thinking I'd save some corp $ on staples... Needless to say my coworkers laughed at me. Well, I only use it to temporarily hold a few pages together, instead of using a paper clip, since this stapler won't keep your papers together for a long period of time. It's been jammed a few times, and I refuse not to use it (I have to prove the coworkers wrong) So, if you need to hold only a few pages together while sorting or filling, then this will work. If you are looking for something that completely replaces the functionality and strength of a real stapler, then this is not what you are looking for."
2,"Cool idea but not so practical as a stapler, very disappointing","I ordered this item from thinkgeek to use at work. I work in immigration and the government hates staples! Unfortunately, they also do not appreciate the big hole this stapler leaves on the paper. And I do not like that it does not work most of the time. And if the paper does not get tucked in properly then you are just left with a hole in your paper and need to staple it anyway. It is a cool idea but does not really serve any purpose. I cannot use it at work even for my own internal papers because it does not staple more than three pages and often doesn't work even for 3 pages. I don't have the time to play around with this thing so I requested to return it, was told to keep it and got a gift certificate for the cost. It is pretty disappointing as I was very excited about the idea of this. I cannot recommend it for practical use but its a cool concept and conversation starter."
2,Adequate and that's about it . . .,"Does an OK job but each hit leaves a big hole in the paper and the tab does little to hold the papers together. If you do 3 hit across or 2 at a right angle it is an improvement.Great idea, poor implementation."
2,Sorry,I have used this product for 15 years putting them in my boat and corvette for winter storage.Never had bought on line or had a problem until this year.Now I have done both.When we started to use them 2 of the packets were ripped making them worthless.That is a 33% increase in the price.When you are in the process of winterizing it is very hard to get online to ask for a replacement.In the future I will buy them locally if I have a problem I can drive down the street to get a replacement.Some items should not be bought on line.The product itself works well.
3,Project Moonbase Redux,"I saw this movie when it was released. For some reason, it always stuck in my mind. I viewed it after buying it from Amazon and realized it was (now) rather hokey. Nevertheless, there were avant garde elements incorporated in Robert Heinlein's script that help the film maintain an interest level."
2,quite bad for a 50's space opera,"In the year 1970, a female colonel named Brites (Donna Martall) with two recruits (Hayden roake and Ross Ford) head out into space to make a plan to establish a military base on the moon as there is a spy on board to ruin the plans.A terrible, cheaply done and poorly written despite written by one of sci-fi's best authors Robert Heilein Sci-fi mess of a movie. I gotta say the idea seems interesting but the film falls flat on it's face, it's sometimes sexist in places but not always as this film features the first female president on film and the acting is just plain bad. Watch this only on MST3K which makes it better to watch."
3,Good vs Evil,"A nice simple old fashioned film made for enjoyment and to say the good guys win. I enjoy it for simple entertainment. There are no monsters coming to slice and dice everyone, there are no super CGI effects. And for those who care about such things - A man and a woman are equals. Both are traveling in space and end on the moon."
1,Dial thermometer malfunctioned after 30 days,"We loved this thermometer and it was perfect for our use. However, it began taking on water (on the inside of the dial) within 48 hours, and within 30 days, it was malfunctioning--reading the pool temp about 10 degrees warmer than actual. Obviously, not a well engineered pool thermometer!"
1,A Fine Fiction,"Chapter 2 of this poorly written fiction opens with a quote.""All men are created equal. They are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights"".The authors allow the reader to believe the origin of the statement to be from Ho Chi Minh.Sorry, Boys Ho Chi Minh did not write the opening lines of the Declaration of Independence. If I recall and please correct me if needed, The Declaration of Independence was written by Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Robert Livingston, and Roger Sherman.However, as the authors clearly explain much of information exposed in this book is new and hitherto unpublished.To paraphrase a previous reviewer of this book, junebug who wrote a fine review...""I'd advise anyone with an interest in historical accuracy and in the politics of the era to avoid this one like the plague""!"
5,A good beginning...,"I am just beginning to study green investing. Found this article accessible and informative. It gave me an overview of the market, and ideas of where to go from here. Substantive. Have just reread it and understood more. Just what I was looking for. Thank you.And I loved being able to download it instantly!"
1,Not inspired from Best Practices,"Could be as an introudtion of a book on Leadership, because it just gives broad and theoretical ideas on Leadership."
5,Great Short Read,"This was a great read that I completed in one sitting, a real boon for any student that is overloaded with work. The info was succinct yet enough to complete a report, while saving a few days of reading in the process. Good stuff!"
2,not really for kids,It's like aiming blind because there are no lasers coming out... i guess for safety reasons that is ok. My 4 and 6 yo son thought it was broken because it just made weak sounds. My kids played with it for 5 minutes and then left it on their wrists like bracelets.I thought it would an awesome toy for my boys but turned out to be a waste of money.
3,laser spy gear,I had read some reviews and knew not to expect a good light beam. The plastic that was to go over one's middle finger for activation was stiff and hard to get working.
2,did not work,"Did not work on my dog, actually, I am her human, but I am not surprised in the least. She is a Jack Russell and Lab mix. Size of a lab and 70 lbs of ATTITUDE. It took har 30 minutes to negate an electronic collar to prevent barking. Howling and high pitched yipes were the result. Don't mess with Mother Nature. Probably not the products fault. Should have named her 'Mind over Matter' and not EZ dawg!!"
1,The original shopaholic book -different title,"I should have read the reviews first before purchasing. This is the first book in the series republished with the UK title. So sad.... I was super excited to read another shopaholic book, despite the fact that the last book wasn't that great."
2,Didn't meet my expectations,"I am a big fan of religious critique and Humanistic texts, however in my library this book is one never touched. When I read such works much of the trust lies upon the research of the author. However this work is literally the sum of other peoples works! There are no direct references to anything more than hearsay. No historical doccumentation. Although I know quite a bit of her demonstrations are accurate, I like my personal opinions to be based on the facts rather than possible rumors. If you really want it, I suggest you go through the bibliography and look through all the books she coppied to put in her own."
3,CHOCOLATE CHUNK COOKIE MIX; PRICEY,"As one would expect, the cookies are delicious. In my opinion, this product is too pricey; all box, little ingredient. I'm glad I tried these cookies, but I'm back to using Nestle."
1,Would Not Buy Again,"I was tremendously dissapointed with this product. First off, it took forever to get to me, actually arriving well after the date it said it was going to. They also used waaaaay more packaging than was remotely necessary - a huge 9""x10"" envelope for this tiny little jar. And lastly the jar was really really really small, if I put makeup in there I have no idea how I would get it out again without making a huge mess since the top is too small for anything larger than an eyeshadow brush and it only has three holes in the top anyway. Booo."
1,It is boring,"My daughter loves Baby Einstein, but this puppet seems to scare her. It is too hard to get your hands in it to make the thing talk. It isn't worth the money."
3,A Parsonian view of society,"Daniel Chirot is a follower of Talcott Parsons. While he does not reveal this fact until his final chapter, it is evident throughout, both in the book's conserative assumptions and its oddly-difficult writing. Nonetheless, it does cover an enormous amount of ground in a small amount of space and is certainly more readable than some books on the subject."
1,"Vapid, Vacuous, and Insulting","This book should never have been published. From authors who regard children as necessary Upper West Side ""accessories"" and view solo practitioners as bottom-feeders who interview poorly, these writers flaunt their myopic worldview to--ultimately-- their own embarrassment.Fortunately they borrowed the conceit for their book from ""The Rules"" and use a tired, weak metaphor of career choice = the right pair of shoes-- these broad hints let you know right away that the book is without merit. By the time you glance through it you're left with the intellectual equivalent of the dregs at the bottom of a Cosmopolitan glass. This kind of ""sisterhood"" in the law is not for the attorneys that I consider colleagues, and certainly not for me."
1,Unfulfilled lawyer gets book deal using her only angle...,"Don't believe the family 5* reviews. I'm a lawyer and read an officemate's copy and I still feel cheated.This book is a waste of money. The thesis is the classic narcissistic ploy- ""have it all without consequence"" (that is, while the kids are in daycare and you toil away billing hours on the fast track to divorce and kids with ADHD).Admitedly I'm a man, but how long until this low-level lawyers admit that the book she's peddling will at best motivate other women to become more like the her (miserable)?It's pretty clear from her petty ""insights"" and vapid writing style that Sherman fits the classic ""Jill of all trades"" mold- mediocre lawyer, mother, and most important, mediocre writer as well."
3,"Good reference, not for teaching","I'm a medical student, currently taking pharmacology during my pre-clinical years and i don't recommend this textbook. Its voluminous, poorly written, and not logically organized. Its really only good as reference book and that's it. If you want to learn pharmacology buy a Lippincotts Illustrated review of pharmacology or Golans principle of pharmacology!"
1,ALARM CLOCK THAT DOESN'T ALARM,I bought this alarm clock for travel. Unfortuately it goes off 15 to 30 minutes early or late. I've given up on trying to use it and will throw it away now.
5,Hilarious..,"Albeit a cartoon, this series touches on things that normally are ignored but since it's a cartoon, it reaches a certain age.."
4,"Love Boondocks, but scepticle and worried....","I agree with the above reviewer in terms of Boondocks being a great show, I love it. I think it is funny and in many ways true to real life in some cases not everything of course. Episodes like ""Invasion of the Katrinians, and ""The story of Thugnificent"" are hilarious. But the thing I am worried about is what happened to all the episodes?? I did not see any more than maybe 12 to 13 new ones this season, I am not sure if that was due to me not catching them, or if they were just never aired??? If anyone could tell me that would be great but I will buy this for sure for my collection and hope that they continue to make this cartoon even with all the critisism.. Hey if cartoons like South Park, and Family Guy can get away with it on Prime Time TV then who cares what BET or anyone else thinks, IT WILL GET VIEWERS!!!""As a matter of fact ima go buy me a dog right now, and ima name it Katrinian, and every time it rains ima kick it"""
4,Even better than season 1,"This season is a lot funnier than season 1, but the special features are not as good."
4,Not Your Usual Convention,"Lucy gets a chance to leave home for an all expense paid trip to a newspaper convention. Who wouldn't want to stay in a 5 Star hotel in downtown Boston and get away from cooking, cleaning, laundry, kids, and pets? Lucy finds herself in the middle of another murder investigation. Can she find the real killer in just one week? This Lucy Stone novel is different because of the historical Boston city setting. Lucy takes many side trips to see many of the sights in Boston. Lucy also finds herself in many delicate situations while solving the murder and discovering there is, ""no place like home."""
4,Rock Bound Boulevard,"It really does sometimes surprises me when a rock group that has lost a bit of luster, shines all over again. That has definitely happened here with Green Day. They have seemed alright for awhile, but lost a bit of their feeling with the Nimrod record. Yet, their latest single is one best so far this year. Boulevard Of Broken Dreams, the second track from American Idiot is a very well-drived adult rock song that really stands out very well. I like this song because it really speaks out to you and understands the pain that you walk with alone. I just hope the punk rockers can keep this pace up.Song: B 1/2+"
3,"A decent reference, but doesn't live up to the claims","I'm not saying ""don't"" buy this book. I'm saying buy it used at a considerable discount. It's got some useful information and and few 'exercises' that are helpful, but overall it's kind of flaccid. It's worth a read or two."
1,No no no....,"The entire concept of writing fiction of ANY kind is to use your imagination mixed with the things that you know. A book to TELL you how to write fantasy does not make a bit of sense! If you are building a world, use common sense and round it out, smooth the edges, be as 'realistic' as you can for a Fantasy story. The problem with Fantasy these days is that all Elves are the same; all Dwarves are the same, all Goblins are the same...every book written is basically a carbon copy of the last one. These races DO NOT EXIST in our world, therefore you cannot say they MUST be one way or another. Get back to IMAGINATION - just use the sense you were given. TRUE old fashioned imagination has created the BEST books ever read."
5,You'd think writers would know what words mean...,"compendium ( P ) Pronunciation Key (km-pnd-m)n. pl. compendiums or compendia (-d-)A short, complete summary; an abstract.A list or collection of various items.This book is a complete COMPENDIUM. And in that, it does its job extremely well. I would definitely recommend this to any writer who has a vocabulary big enough to understand that.Useful information, almost invaluable once you start using it. Whether you use it to be inspired, or for a general idea of what you're talking about before you start writing, this book really is indispensable."
1,"Incomplete, inaccurate, and inaccessible","This book is really little more than a glorified glossary. Many critical terms are left undefined or are defined incorrectly; I found chapters 5, 9, and 10 particularly troublesome, perhaps because I have a strong academic background in those areas.Overall, this is a very weak effort. It does little more than provide a few more terms for lazy authors to sling around incorrectly."
2,Not as Complete as the Title Suggest,"It's definately a good starting point for a reference library, yet it still seems to leave a lot out. For example, it does little to explain world-building and gives less-than-detailed examples in a lot of the book's sections. Most of the info in the book can be found with a search engine. I recommend it only for those of you who want to build a decent reference library."
5,Thunders at his best,"Johnny Thunders is (was) the best ""new york junkie"" in the music scene. The all-dope music of Thunders and friends are the best music to listen to when you are trying to stop using dope. Did this with another CD of him, but also on this CD you can stay happy while feeling sick for not having any chinese rocks. Too much junkie business is al too true and ""so alone"" is straight from my heart.Jan"
2,Nice Set-Doesn't Last,"I purchased this set and we have used it 3 times over the past year in a small area (no extremely long whacks). The very first time we used it, one of the mallet heads broke. The next time, one of the balls fractured. The last time we used it, one of the mallet shafts split in two. Initially, it seemed like a great set, but it doesn't hold up. I would not recommend this product."
5,Easy-to-read informative summary,Abraham Ascher has succeeded in bringing alive the history of Russia from its very beginnings up to the present time.
3,"Great Idea, But Only Fair Execution","We gave this to our dino-loving son for his 5th birthday. The sound on this toy leaves a lot to be desired. Kind of tinny; the narrator speaks with a British-sounding accent that's not the easiest to understand given the sound quality. But the idea behind the toy is great and he does like to play with it. Quality could've been better though. Also, the model we received was not exactly what's shown in the picture. The functions look to be the same, but all in a different place (on the right side vs. the bottom)."
1,interactive amazing dinosaurs,"I am a preschool director and am very familiar with Constructive Playthings as a wonderful source of educational products. I ordered for Christmas the Interactive Amazing Dinosaurs for my 4 year old grandson who is very interested in learning about dinosaurs. He played with it once then it stopped working. His parents replaced the batteries but it still did not work. I contacted Constructive Playthings and they immediately sent a replacement. We opened the package, turned it on, it made one sound, some lights blinked then it stopped. A reset button on the back said ""If unit stops from operating press reset button once"". We pressed it, the toy said one sentence then quit working again. We did this several times but this toy just does not work. There is a light that does not go off. I now have two toys to return and a very disappointed grandson. Do you think that this toy has a problem????"
1,Save your quarter,"A student purchased this at a yard sale for twenty five cents. It is, without a doubt, one of the most inane uses of paper to publish anything, especially a book.I have been showing it to my class as Bad Writing 101....A pifle..."
2,sizing deceiving,"when specifying Medium and Large, this description falls short. looking at plain Ateco tips as an example, this coupler set holds Medium - 800-803, and Large - 804-806, but not the very largest, 807-809. also, not a huge value to have just one base with two rings."
4,"Fine shoes, a bit heavy for ultimate frisbee","These are solid shoes. I'm not giving these 5 stars because there's nothing exceptional about them.I bought them to play Ultimate Frisbee, because I wanted more support than soccer cleats give.My feet have sustained chronic, low-grade injuries for the past 10 years, and I found that like most shoes, these did nothing to help. But like with most athletic shoes, adding SuperFeet Berry insoles to these cleats has taken away my foot pain."
5,Great Cleats,"I bought these for my daughter. We searched the stores for hte cleats she wanted, I finally went online for them. They are adorable and she says they are the most comfortable cleats she's had. I was very satisified with this purchase, so happy I am going to return to Amazon to try and find the same type of cleats in a mens for my son."
1,a waste of time,i hooked this up and got nothing. no signal at all.i just threw it out.the quality of the Asian products is so low that it is a waste of everybody's time.what is the point?
2,Not impressed at all.,I purchased this product hoping to find some relief for insomnia without having to resort to prescription drugs. I was not impressed. I actually felt energized after taking this. Very disappointing.
2,A Book Black America Needs To Read,"Star Parker opens the door to subjects we, Americans of African descent, need to critically consider. Why are we still debating issues that the Liberals have promised they would fix - for years. Why are out-of-wedlock births epidemic in the communities of color? When did being conservative mean you had to abandon intellectual honesty for liberalism? Why do we have these media appointed ""black leaders"" that have no connection to our daily lives? Why does the title ""Reverend"" have the power to cloud the minds of black folk and bestow upon them omnipresent knowledge?I have needed to read this book for a long, long time. For all us, Americans of African descent, take heart someone speaks the truth if you would just consider."
5,American Dream Documentary,"This book should be read by every high school student in America so as to provide an antidote to the poison water of liberal education. The author documents how the cycle of welfare, which so soothes liberal guilt, creates a web of dependency that far too few attempt to escape. She details how politicians purchase votes with our tax dollars. A great story of personal dignity reclaimed."
1,hypocritical,"She is judging classes of people just based on her personal experiences. Not very Christian-like. Using her stories as some kind of template for the rest of society does more harm than good, and it seems to me like this lady's primary concern is for having a voice, not spreading the word of God, not doing God's will, and certainly not helping America's poor."
1,Skewed,"I wish I had not agreed to review this book. Half way into the first chapter I found myself becoming angry. A majority of my family has been apart of the working poor. Facts are, people who are in poverty seem to be ""happy"" because they make the best of what they got, not because life is somehow better. Also, to suggest that if we left small business alone to do what they want that they would not only do ""right"" by their employees but consumers is putting more faith in business than I am willing to. Business is about making money and left to their own devices, it will revert back to the Industrial Revolution. I will have to agree to disagree with this author."
2,PURE GENIUS,"I don't understand the negative reviews of this product and to be quite honest I smell an agenda behind them. My son sat here and was completely taken by this program. The creativity that went into this project is so refreshing and everybody I've shown it to feel's this way as well. This type of learning is about intuition and creative interactive freedom. It doesn't need a manual or directions since there is no winning involved. It makes you see the alphabet like a child again, full of excitement and mystery. I can also suggest trying to find the author's other interactive program ""midnight play"" which is also full of visual and sonic beauty."
1,Not structured enough for a 4 year old.,"This was an extremely difficult game to get into. In other software geared towards 3-5 there is a helping guide during the process of the game to keep you on track. With this game you had to have the child search for the ""portal"" in the upper left corner of the screen to back out of a game. The sound was of poor quality as well.Overall, this game, while visually stimulating, did little to engage my 4 year old."
1,poor monitor cable,"I purchased this cable as a replacement, and it is far worse than the original I had. There is noticable ""shadow"" distortion. My advice is to buy a higher quality cable w/ ferriete beads. This cable was not useable."
5,Meaningfully Moving Forward,"Personable in tone, expansive in concept, The Contented Achiever shares with the reader both the opportunity as well as techniques for building, maintaining, not to mention achieving lasting appreciation while gently but avidly steering the participant toward a meaningful manner of acquiring, in simple fashion, the finer side of life. This book stands out as a pointed yet loving beacon of enthusiasm, warmth, humor and just plain good sense. It will move you forward. I'm already anticipating the next offering from these authors!"
2,Not what I thought,"This item is listed as brass, but it really has a brass like finish on it. It's really not a particularly well made piece, and had I seen it before I purchased it, I wouldn't have bought it."
3,Lacking Options,"Virtual Pose 2 is a useful reference for any artist who wants to draw the figure, but a few features I was hoping for are missing. First off, I had misunderstood things and thought that you had 54 poses with six different models for each pose. Instead there are six models with nine poses each. That is not too big a deal, but just know not to expect things that way. The biggest problem for me is that there is no option to control the size of the display. When you run on a monitor at a high resolution, the workspace for the program is really small. I have to drop my resolution from 1200x1064 down to 800x600 in order to get a decent size for reference. This is not too big a deal for anybody who runs at a lower resolution, but is a big inconvenience for me personally. I do appreciate the fact that the poses are ""tastefully"" edited when a pose would be too revealing for the female models. I havent' found the instructional videos that helpful yet, but haven't given them too much time."
2,Only REAL hip hop fans would see how boring this album is.,"I miss the Wu- Tang of old before they became arrogent, money crazed sellouts. This album is sooo mainsteam. Not only that its all so slow. I was always a fan of our wu boys when they did the intense songs. But there is not a one on this album. What I'll give him is ocassionally puts some decent jazzy loops in the songs. Overall I'm not sorry I bought this album because there some good songs on here. But overall I think Mr. Tical needs to give away all of his money and go back to his creative days when he was a poor, innovative artist."
5,Last good Method Man cd.Horror rap/Future/Gangsta/Wu,"When I first heard this cd it was okay. I came back to it like 3 years later and a much better sound system and was trying to figure out what the hell I was thinking in not liking this album from the start. Kinda feel bad for Mef. Few cd's catch me sleeping like that. This album to me was a classic. It's messed up when your own fans don't get it till 3years later. I don't feel like writing in detail, so I'll sum it like this. Mef lyrically and beatwise went everywhere on this cd and truly needed 28 songs to get it all out. It somehow was futuristic and gangsta and horror. All his stuff out now is not weak but just not worth buying. This was the last Method Man album in my opinion. Hail to the Ticallion."
2,I don't get it,"well, no effort here obviously. I'm sure all you true wu-fans know what i'm talking about. very sloppy, mostly because RZA only produced a small number of songs on the album(that razor edge is missing, plain and simple). Maybe if method man hadn't gone so mainstream he might have tried a little harder."
2,"One good track, get the single instead","The title track is one of my favorite hip hop cuts. Ever. It's tight and dark, with a horror-movie feel. The rest of the album is crapola. It always seems that with Meth it's hit or miss, there's no in-between. Either his track is a classic or it's unlistenable. If you like the title track, get the single instead (the somewhat annoying intro is shorter and it includes the video). If you're new to Method Man, get Tical instead. He was hungry then, not Mr. MTV.Overall, Meth has an incredible flow and one of the best voices in Rap. Peace."
1,very weak,this album is more closer to Puffy than what you'd expect from a wu memeber.very cross-over to the point of a joke.the music and the rhymes are lacking any edge or structure.whatever skills he may have had they continue to go down the drain.i've never been big on WU though 36 chambers was tight but i know when someones fallen off and he has.
5,first ta rate it!!,"i bought this album yesterday.i could have bought any cd i wanted in the store...so i bought this!i didnt realy look at it...later i looked and it had 28 songs!!!!i poped it in my cd player,and i love it!perfect cd!awsome!i love the songs:spazola,step by step,torture,judgement day,cradle rock,dangerous grounds,and big dogs!those songs rock!!!!i love you play to much!it is so funny!chris rock just keeps sayin:(somebodys name)aka(somebodys name)aka.....and so on!its an awsome cd....GET IT!!!!"
5,Johnny Blaze is blazin',"The whole album is tight. Yo, you gotta get it while it's hot. Tical 2000 baby. Judgement Day."
2,This is not a good album...do not buy it!!,"I don't have much to say about this album except it is too long, too commercial, and indicative of too little effort on Method Man's part. Do not buy this album. Buy the original Tical instead because it didn't sell nearly as many units as it should have."
2,Not the same Wu,Most of the songs in the album are not even produced by RZA. He only produced one song! What is Method Man thinking? 27 tracks and none of the songs that I could feel. This is by far the worst Wu album I've ever gotten. I never liked Method Man anyways so you guys might dissagree with me.
3,Good product-poor instructions/packing material,"The product works well, but it took a bit of a learning curve to determine that the MDA sitting upright in the cradle position will only charge if the USB connection is made to a commputer and not the wall plug.The wall plug connection charges when the battery is removed from the MDA only. I had to augment the charging process by wedging a business card between the battery and housing to force the contact in order to get a good charge.Also, the shipping box contained minimal packing material, the product raddled so much in the box, I held my fingers hoping it would work."
2,Died after 8 months,"It worked great for 8 months and then suddenly it stopped working. The light comes on but it doesn't charge my phone. I have a samsung alias 2, which is a shit phone too. but yeah, this charger is cheap but will stop working eventually. not expensive at least. but be aware of the defects."
4,Carrying Case Review,"Appears to be a good storage case for my new chain saw. Since I don't use the saw often, I needed a case to store it safely and yet be able to grab it and other accessories quickly when needed. This seems to fit the bill."
4,One of Trini's finest,"Trini Lopez's '60s albums for Reprise have been appearing on CD at rather uneven intervals. This disc from 1967 is among the latest batch to make the move to the digital format, and it's very welcome. Thought not one of his biggest sellers, ""In London"" perfectly sums up Trini's appeal. There's a mix of singalong tunes (the Lopez original ""Happy""); reworked covers of then-current hits (a swinging ""Strangers in the Night"" and a rather sexy reading of ""Mame""); standards (a hand-clapping ""It Had to Be You""); and a few surprises, including a solid take on take on the Rolling Stones' ""Lady Jane."" The singles from the album -- ""Gonna Get Along Without Ya' Now"" and the double-sided ""Takin' the Back Roads"" (wonderful!) and ""Your Ever Changin' Mind"" -- didn't break out to become huge hits, but it doesn't reflect the quality of the album. Really, this is all-around solid stuff. Now, Collectables, please release 1969's ""The Whole Enchilada"" next..."
5,The Best Album Of All Time,This is the greatest album of all time.It contains the Bee Gees' greatest song!I love it too much!I rate this item 16 stars!
5,Excellent,"Their Greatest Hits: The Record include the most excellent songs in two discs, even thought 40 songs are not enough for the Bee Gees' fans, I really enjoy listening to it. Anymore?"
3,"Points for being comprehensive, but some bad transitions","(3 and 1/2 stars) The first question is why yet another Greatest Hits collection? They already have 4 or 5 others out there, plus a box set. I guess what this one has is very comprehensive coverage of the band's entire history, and it is indeed convenient to have it all together in one place. Some of those early hits like ""Run To Me"" were nearly as big in their day as ""Stayin' Alive,"" and it's good to be reminded that there is more to the Bee Gees than just Saturday Night Fever. Still, those career transitions were pretty radical, and it's rather jarring to hear ""Jive Talking"" right after ""Run To Me."" The band's '80s and '90s output also dropped off from the quality of their disco era material, so the 2nd disc of this set becomes progressivley less interesting from about the halfway point. Still in all, The Record is definitely the collection to go for if you don't already own one of the other sets already."
2,OVERPRODUCED SYMPHONIC MESS,"In the case of the Bee Gees, less is more. This album is like an ABBA recording session with more strings than a tennis racquet. This is NOT the one for true Bee Gees fans. Cherry pick from other albums or download from web, because you will be disappointed with this one."
3,bee gees greatest hits,This c.d. collection was great. There is alot of songs i didn't know they sang. Makes a great gift for the 40 something.
3,MORE LOGO's ??,Just got this set today and only watched a brief portion to see how the quality was. It's impressive. But was it really necessary to put the Major League Baseball Logo right below the FOX logo throughout the entire game and series?? It's a bit of a distraction.
3,strategies for selecting and verifying hearing aid fitting,This book is for students who need basic skills for fitting hearing aids and explains about the selection of hearing aids as well.
5,Unbelievably Good,"I was first given this manga as a gift, and I didn't think I'd like it at all. I'm not the type to read Romance novels or anything of the sort. But I gave this a chance, and I am so glad I did.It kept me completely captivated right to the end. The artwork is gorgeous, the characters are well thought out, and the lyrics are catchy (I would love to hear some of them actually sung).I cannot wait to read the next one."
3,An Adequately-Illustrated Collection of Classic Poems & Prayers,"This is an adequately-illustrated collection of classic poems and prayers, some of them traditional, others by authors such as Christina Rossetti, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Robert Browning. It is included in several homeschooling curriculums and may be best used for repeated reading and memorization exercises. Unlike nursery rhymes, these poems are serious rather than funny, and it may take a committed parent to help young children appreciate them. As a basic introduction to classic poetry it is pretty good, but is by no means essential. If a child responds well to A.A. Milne's or Shirley Hughes' poetry, this might be a very nice supplement to their library."
3,And another record label sabotages its artists...,"Both singles from t.a.T.u.'s new album are selling as promos all over ebay because those promotional singles have 13 mixes of each song on them. Guess what we get here? The original mix, an edit of an incredible 8 minute version, and one full length remix. Guess what all the fans are going to do? Either buy those astronomically priced singles off ebay--meaning, the record company nor the artist will get any money for it--or they will just download all the remixes they want on a file sharing program--again, no money for record label or artist.Should you do either of those things? If you want the mind blowing full length LEX mix or the other slammin mixes from the promo...just weigh your options thanks to the record company...."
2,DAMAGED CHANGING TABLE,"My nine month pregnant sister received my gift, the changing table, with substantial damage. She called the company and was told another could be shipped in 8 weeks - too long! With difficulty, she returned it to the store (BABIES ARE US), where they had three others in stock. She took one home, unpacked it and found it had almost identical damage. Back to the store. It turned out that three of the four changing tables were similarly damaged due to how the company packages the item. She did manage to get the fourth one available and is happy with the item (the only reason I give it 2 stars). This is unacceptable, especially given the price of the item and that my poor nine month pregnant sister had to go to these difficult lengths. I was VERY unhappy with the furniture company and will not purchase with them ever again."
3,"Get if you must, but don't have high expectations","The Yamato movies help to fill in the blanks for Star Blazers fans, but don't expect all of the movies to be first rate. While the animation and sound is certainly 1970's-early 1980's quality, the script is still quite good on some of the movies. Watch out for the first Yamato movie though, everything seems to go by so quickly with exaggerated jumps between each major encounter. Watch the Star Blazers Series One instead. Also, be ready for Japanese language and English subtitles. If you can handle it, then check these out."
4,An explanation of the French Revolution.,"A well written history of the French Revolution. Bosher describes in detail why the French monarchy, along with the Catholic Church and nobility perished in this revolution/civil war. Louis XVI was a weak king with liberal political thinking. He strove to be inclusive in leading a reform of the financial administration. However when the nobels and provinces rebelled at this event, he called the Estates General to go directly to the people. The Estates General evolved into a legislative grouping further taking away power from the French monarch.Eventually, the groupings of different factions splitered the country and caused the King and much of the royal family to be killed.Bosher does a great job of detailing why the French Revolution occurred. As such, it was not simply a class war, but a frecturing of society that led to the political reformation of European society. This is a well written although dry history of the French Revolution."
1,Disappointed with this phone,"I too was disappointed to realize that this phone doesn't have a line-in-use indicator, and that the backup battery will not power the phone during a power outage. Both features were present on earlier VTech models. Also the speakerphone isn't nearly as good as my previous model VTech 2-line. This phone is a big step back, feature-wise. What really burns me is six months out of warranty, the displays on both the base and the handset are losing segments. The handset is no longer readable, and both displays get less readable by the week. VTech wants over half what the phone cost to repair it, and I'm afraid it will just go out again in a year. I don't recommend it."
4,Excellent,I've been using it almost every day and I am really happy with it. It is very sturdy and it makes very little noise. I like it.
4,Good machine,"I got this stationary trainer for Christmas from Amazon. It arrived great and with all the right pieces. I love it - it provides a way to get a quick workout in without dragging my bike down three flights of stairs or when it's cold. The assembly is easy - true, but I would STRONGLY recommend watching the DVD setup and assembly instruction first (this is also on youtube). Had I done that I would saved a lot of headaches that the vague instruction manual caused. I also know very little about the mechanics of my bike and they don't explicitly explain what the skewer and extra cone cup that come with the trainer are for. After much research, and with what seemed to be extra parts in hand, I stumbled upon a youtube video made by the company explaining how to replace the skewer in your bike and why you'd do that. Do yourself a favor and check out the videos available to you before you embark on this venture. After that, happy (indoor) trails!"
3,Liquid Quiver,I have gone through 2 bottles of liquid quiver. It works. It makes for easy arrousal and intense orgasms. It does taste really bad. But if you mix it with a tiny bit of juice and shoot it down it is definetly worth it. I have done shots of tequilla this is much better than that. It really does work.It also works really quickly. You need to be ready to go within about 5-15 minutes for the best result. Try it.
3,OK,"Like most of the books in this series, the information in them is very basic and does not go into very deep detail. Good as an introduction though. Also has excellent color pictures that show you how the knights dressed. A quick and easy read."
3,it's an okay book....,"We used this for a small group discussion, but somehow I felt it was more like a self-help book (for someone at an emotionally low level, pulling himself/herself up) than a book to seek self-worth (for someone who just wants to understand how to be more Christ-like). The way it was written might be useful for someone who has undergone abuse in the past, or someone who has very extreme personalities. Somehow I don't feel as connected to this as other in the small group, but I guess the workbook in the back could be very helpful for discussions. Overall, it's a great read, but again, I just don't feel very connected to its themes."
3,Falls Short,"McGee goes through a lot of pages to talk about various beliefs and counterpoints them well with God's solutions. However, the book is woefully short on practical instruction on how to change your false belief thinking into spiritual truths. I don't disagree with what he has to say. I just wish he had said more about how to combat the false beliefs we spend a lifetime learning."
3,A Flying 101 type of book,"I have read a few fear of flying books and found this book to be better suited to the first-time or infequent flyer. The relaxation techniques metioned in this book are common sense so I didn't learn much there. The books overview of seat, meal and flight type, booking and layovers are common knowledge someone who has flown a few times. I travel on business frequently and have read books with more detail on safety features and the physics of flying. For the first-time flyer I would give this book 5 stars, for the expirenced flyer looking for new ways to calm the jitters, look elsewhere."
5,Restoring the Jewishness of the Gospel: A Message for Christians (Paperback),"This is an excellent book, I think that all serious Christians, should have this book in there collection. In fact Christians should buy two of them one to keep for themselves and another to give to another believer to read. I have learned a lot, and it has changed my mind (in a good way) about the gospel. I highly recommend this book. The book was in excellent condition, and I received it in a timely manor."
4,Great summation of Messianci Judaism,This is a great little introduction to Stern's larger word Messianic Judaism. Stern does a great job of beginning the argument for understanding Christianity from a Jewish lens. I do not agree with all of his conclusions but all in all I found it insightful and well worth the time.
2,Weak - David Stern writes from a Baptist point of view,While I was very interested in this book I found it to be very lacking in substance and with most of David Sterns writting it has a very Baptist leaning...not Jewish perspective.
2,Good reference but not a difinitive theological work,"Mr. Sterns' book is a good reference for people who have a working knowledge of Jewish-Christian issues. The author shares some good insights. However, there is too much emphasis and leaning towards Christian fundamentalism in the book for anyone to use it as a difinitive guide in this crucial spiritual area. Balance this book along with works by R. Kendall Soulen, Marvin Wilson, Mark Nanos, Harvey Cox, and a myriad of other Paulist Press releases that shed a more accurate light on the realities of the Jewish roots of Christianity."
1,save your money,This was absolutely useless. I bought it for when my dogs decide to fight or play too rough. I had bought 5 spray cans. When the dogs started to get into a dispute I used all 5 without effect
4,Better if it lasted longer...,I ride bike and need to use this often. This container does not last long. I wish it was a bit larger. IT did work to keep the dogs away.
4,Works great for big time behavior issues,"This is not just for warding off dogs. This is a great tool for training your own dog. As a behaviorist I have used it to stop that very persistent boxer from jumping on people, the rottweiler from barking it's head off at everyone who passes --- just hide the can in your sleeve, the next time your pooch does the thing that you just can't live with, give him a squirt, and he will not being doing that behavior for long. Best of all, he's not mad at you! You don't have to yell or heaven forbid, spank anymore! Not once have I made it through a whole can for one dog, one behavior. It usually only takes three times or so catching them in the act. Love this stuff. One star is missing only because it's not really affective on agressive behaviors -- you have to go to something a little stronger for that."
3,"This is not a ""cure all""","As a person who interracts with aggressive dogs on a daily basis and has had many occasions to try this product, I've found the title to be a bit misleading. While this will temporarily annoy/disorient some aggressive dogs, if a dog is really determined enough this will not ""stop"" him. Please heed the ""fine print"" warning on the label before counting on this for your safety. I'll give this three stars as this will temporarily distract your low-medium aggressive dogs thus allowing you a chance to escape. I simply cannot give this 4-5 because it is not effective against a high-violent aggressive dog. It's better than nothing but PLEASE always have a back up plan...."
4,Works so far,"Hi,The Isobar is sold and heavy. I haven't had a power surge since i got it so can't comment on it's capability."
3,"neat science, poetic writing, but unsympathetic characters","I enjoyed this book, but not enough to gush over.I enjoyed Flynn's vision of future technology. Especially the milli-g acceleration, the different types of humans, with different bone structures and biologies from the different parts of the solar systems, and of course, the solar sail technology.I also found Flynn's writing to be sometimes poetic and beautiful.I didn't care much for the characters. They were unsympathetic; I couldn't care about them. Sometimes characters' flaws make them interesting. I didn't find that to be the case here. And I found the writing about the characters to give the whole book a relatively pessimistic flavor, which left a bit of a bad taste."
5,Love it!,I've had this product for a few years now and I love it! Be aware though at the time I purchased it Win XP was still fairly the dominant PC os and that's really the operating system this was built for if you plan on buying be aware that there are no Vista or WIndows 7 drivers available now or in the future it is in effect an obsolete product as behringer moved on to the BCD3000 and other controllers which they have released new drivers for.
4,Great Guide For A Great Travel Destination!,My husband recently took me to Costa Rica for my thirtieth birthday and we used this guide every day. We travelled to Santa Teresa & visited many places of interest & local places to eat in the area. The guide was most helpful. We went to the waterfalls in Montezuma & would not have known about them if not for the guide. The hotel/restaurant reviews were very accurate and saved us a LOT of heartache. Thanks Frommers!
3,Good guide but not the best,"I traveled to Costa Rica with some friends. All together we had four different guides. The best was Lonely Planet's, Frommer's ranking second.We found the guide lacking an enormous amount of maps, specially for cities. The guide is written for US tourists only. Since we were all from Spain, the conflict was served.G."
3,"Fairly good, but as others have mentioned....","it's too much like a copycat version of SRV. Mato is certainly a good guitarist, but beyond that, this is a bar band sound. Red House is the standout on this cd, and I can listen to it again and again, it's kick ass. The rest is good, but nothing that makes me go ""WOW, who is this?"" and wish for more. I would like to see them live, to see if that would change my opinion. But the comparisons here to Hendrix, SRV, Winters, Trout, Beck, etc. aren't compliments as much as an admission that Mato is a cover artist. Glad I bought the cd, but it's far from a standout in my collection of blues music. I can actually think of at least 2 local bar bands who play as well if not better."
1,horrible,"If you love Little Steven's work with Bruce and the Jukes this album is absolutely un-listenable. There is not a single track on the album you will want to hear in entirety. This is coming from a fan whose favorite album of all time is "" Men without women"". If your thinking of buying this do yourself a favor and listen to what Little Steven was - not what he became. Absolute crap music. Nevermind his continual political rants that NOBODY wants to hear."
4,Fine Effort by a Talented Musician,"In some ways this record is a departure from the usual Little Steven music but it still delivers the goods. Steven wrote, produced, and in large part performed the entire album. He is backed by two of the best talents in rock music today: Jon Bonham on drums and Adam Clayton of U2 on bass. This disc rocks a little harder than most of Little Steven's music, but it just shows a different side of his prodigious talent. Recommended."
3,Good,"Yep, good but not great - if you're a fan of the series, I think you'll like the updates to the characters (the somewhat wiser and slower Billy ray was probably my favorite) In fact all of the returning characters seem more grown up (to a point) which was interesting. The old characters in this book (Fortunato, Mr. Nobody, Popinjay) weren't really ever my favorites, but they're OK. I'd say bring back the Sleeper and Modular Man!As far as the actual plot, I thought it was OK, but not as good as the heyday of the series. I think there were a few flubs in there, too. The typos that other folks have mentioned are in there, but that didn't bug me nearly as much as the fact that 2 of the main characters named John (as well as the author... I mean, really.)? That was kind of distracting.So, overall, a 3."
1,not happy,"I thought that it was very cheap looking. You can't tell from the picture, but the print is outlines of bunnies fishing in ponds, etc. I returned the product and the curtains the same day it arrived. I ordered the Trend Lab Versailles crib set instead. I am still waiting for it to come."
3,Amazing,This amazing invention is a fun and environmental friendly way to attach papers. It works well on only a few papers but well worth it.
5,Never run out of staples again!,"OK, well maybe that is an overstatement. Since this can only staple 5 pages max, you may still need to keep a conventional stapler around if you need to staple lots of pages. But for 5 pages or less, this thing is very cool! The way it creates the little slit and tucks the flap inside is ingenious, and seems to hold just as well as a metal staple would. No messy staples to pull if you need to separate the pages later, and no sharp edges to worry about. Very nice item, even if only for the novelty factor."
2,"probably a good techno CD, but very poor compared to the ori","It's basically remakes of some of Telex's classic tracks in a techno style.... Far behind the original sound, I wasn't able to recognize most of the tracks without looking at the sleeve to check the titles. !"

5,Great service and product!,"I had a really good experience with the seller in that I ordered the wrong item (left handed) and they were responsive and quick in getting me the correct item back. I had a response to my initial email in less than 24 hours, and once they received my package back they sent me the correct one quickly and took care of the shipping costs.The clubs are great and my kids love them. Good quality nice little bag with pockets for practice balls, etc. I'd highly recommend them!"
5,A Look At Why True Christianity Will Never Be Popular,"Christianity is great news. It tells how Jesus took care of our sin on the cross and that we can have eternal life. Isn't that wonderful? Wouldn't everyone want to receive the free gift?In reality, on a minority will, which is the theme of this book. It states that true Christianity is really offensive, both in its original setting during the days of the apostles and in our current time.This book is useful in helping us understand why so many reject the gospel. The one thing I disagree with is MacArthur's view of election, which is more Calvinistic than myself."
5,The best book sine the atifact cycle,Has to be the best book i have read since the atifact cycle. It explains Magic in detail.
5,Tremendous,"I have watched every episode at least 3 times each, never gets old.When I want a pick me up, I just watch SG1, isn't that what 'entertainment' is supposed to do, allow a venue of escape?You can be one of those that pick apart the details of the show so much that you never enjoy it or you can just sit back and escape - your choice."
4,Stargate SG1 Season 8,"Very enjoyable season. Disc two would not play but the series was replaced quickly,it seemed to be a problem with that one disc and two DVD players, same problem with the replacement, but it played on a third DVD player.The season is enjoyable, new adventures and it keeps your interest."
5,good scifi,"I've been a fan of this series for years and recommend this set. It's well put together and attractive. This is the only year I own. I purchased it because I wanted a copy of one episode that showed off a Vancouver location especially well. Looking down the street toward English Bay, across the seawall walk near the Sylvia. Though filmed in van it's not that easy to discern actual locations. They are pretty careful. I am considering buying other yearly sets now that I see the quality of this one. Open the iris now."
4,Great little table,We recently got two lamps and needed a couple of inexpensive tables. These fit the bill. The first one went together without a hitch. When I pulled out the second one I noticed they had mis-packaged and given me 3 drawer sides and no back. Since I have the tools I just cut one side down to 12 inches and continued putting it together. They look great under the lamps.For someone without the tools this could have been a problem. The finish on mine was nice and aside from the above I like the product.
4,Very nice table,"Bought 2 of these. Great product for the price. Easy to assemble, put it together in about 30 minutes (that's pretty good considering I usually take hours to put anything together). All the holes and parts matched up perfectly, so no trouble there. The tables seem very sturdy, not wobbly at all. The only thing that's kind of rickety is the drawer. When pulled out it tilts downward like it could fall out. The only thing stopping it is a little wooden peg that you insert into the top portion of the table. The drawer rests on and uses a couple of wooden boards rather than a rolling track. This is fine considering I paid about $70 for a pair. I wasn't expecting anything spectacular. The tabletop had a few scratches on it, but nothing I really care about. I'm not picky. The tables work well next to my bed, perfect height. I'm pleased with this purchase."
3,Rough around the edges,The tables are nice and sturdy but they aren't very smooth around the edges of the top. One of the table tops was drilled the wrong way which I'm pretty handy and it was an easy fix. They don't go together very square either without some tweeking other than that they are nice tables for the price.
2,Missing parts,This item was purchased as a gift. After it was assembled it was discovered that parts were missing. The biggest missing part is the bottom of the drawer leaving the drawer unusable. Amazon was contacted for a solution. Hopefully it will be one that is agreeable to all parties.
1,Not as promised,"This table is ok (maybe even three starts) except for one detail: it does not come as advertised. I ordered two tables. Neither of the tables I ordered has a drawer that is finished to match the rest of the table (as is pictured). The table(s), as packaged, looks idiotic."
2,It's not recommended,The drawer doesn't shut all the way and the stopper couldn't be hammered in.We were using this for a vacation home and didn't have all of our tools to fix it but will on our next visit.
2,was not complete.,"the order Winsome Wood End Table/Night Stand with Drawer and Shelf, Natural was not complete.one part ""Drawer Bottom board (I)"" was missed. How can I have this missed part?"
4,very nice piece for the price,"This arrived in good shape and went together easily. The wood is quite nice. As for other posts complaining about the tabletop being composed of several pieces of wood, well, that's how you make a tabletop. A single slab would warp or cup. In any case the pieces are nicely matched and present a uniform appearance. My only complaint is that the screw for the knob is a little longer than it needs to be; I just used a smaller one. This is definitely a great buy."
3,About what you'd expect for $40.00,"This night stand definitely looks better in the picture. I got the natural finish. The drawer front and the shelf are composite and have that ""fake wood"" look. The top is a nice piece of solid wood, the legs and side brackets also solid wood. I bought this with the intention of painting it and leaving the top natural so it worked out well for me but if I had bought it to leave as is I would not have been satisfied.It needs assembly but that was straightforward and it seems quite solid. The flimsiest part is the bottom of the drawer. Not a high quality piece but pretty good for the price."
4,Great costumer service,"The hamper arrived broken, but after contacting the costumer service we received immediately a replacement. The hamper itself works well and looks nice in the nursery."
4,"Good quality licorice, so-so aesthetic appeal","This is good quality REAL licorice (i.e. flavored with real licorice root, unlike most of what passes for black licorice in the US). It's organic, which I guess is good if that matters to you. The gum appeal (chew) is very good: Chewy, not too sticky, and not too soft.The main downside is presentation. It comes as a ~5 bulk packed bag of licorice ""pellets"" (~3/4"" cylinders). It's not unpleasant, and it's not the ""sticky clump"" the previous reviewer mentioned (perhaps his sat in the heat too long), but no one will be reaching for on the basis of looks...That said, it's good stuff, and it's the real thing."
2,Solid block of sticky mess,"Yes, I know it was a five pound bag. What I didn't know is that it would be a soft sticky mass of licorice. I literally had to break it off in chunks to eat it. I tried putting it in the fridge, but that didn't really help. The flavor is good, but this product is no fun to eat. I certainly wouldn't try to put it in a lunch, the kid would be hassled for bringing a bag of dog doo to school. I did give it two stars for flavor, but texture and presentation get none."
2,Dissapointed,Had this product for over a year now. The metal pole is rusting and the rain gauge/temp gauge is sun damaged with the clear plastic starting to yellow.If you are buying this as an accessory to your garden or patio I would pass on this item. Look for something that made out of copper/glass - it will hold up to the elements.
5,Donaghe continues to deliver!,"Donaghe writes from his heart and Lance proves just that.Lance is a wonderful follow-up to Uncle Sean. Will's and Lance's angst and struggles in a homophobic small community is compellingly written. Lance's near rape and ""castration"" just leaves my heart cold. I am glad that Will's and Lance's love for each other is strong enough to withstand the hostility and animosity. They maybe just 18 but their committment to each other and their referring to each other as husband just warms my heart. The ending is frustrating as it leaves Will ""hanging"" but it is a perfect bridge to the 3rd book. Keep it up Donaghe!"
5,wonderful quirky southern tale,"Donald Harington, a protege of William Styron, introduces us to the whacky and wonderful Stay More, Ark. Harington is a masterful storyteller who is just started with this funny, poignant, sometimes bawdy tale of the crazy cast of misfits that live in Stay More. This is not for those who prefer a straight linear story, for Harington is both narrator and character in this story as well."
4,Interesting Author,I've since bought all of his books because he's a good read. I then donated them to my local nursing home.His mixture of fantasy and fact was most interesting and I enjoyed that he lets even the animals in his books tell their side of the story. Unusual author.
4,Excellent cookware set for the money,"Good quality set for everyday cooking. I use cast iron for most of my frying, but this set fills the nitch for basic cookware needs. My only complaint is that the coatings are easily damaged. This is my second set in 3 years."
5,So happy with this set!,"I love my new T-fal! Awesome products, perfect purchase!I am so happy with my cookware!! They are light, easy to handle or use, the food tastes differently as finally nothing is gluing into the pan (like before with my old pans), also easy to wash! Not even talking about the fact, that you do not only have some pans, but great pans in different shapes plus tools! I am just so happy! Everything is perfect with this product!I just regret that I did not buy them earlier.."
5,Absolutely the benchmark of excellence,"The authors absolutely produced a gem in this Cisco QoS Exam Certification Guide. Whilst I used the book primarily to pass the 642-642 QoS exam, this book can definitely serve as a reference to anyone remotely doing anything with QoS.The authors explain the concepts in a easy-to-follow manner, and follow each concept up with at least 1 or more examples that complement the concept and re-inforce learning.Compared to other Cisco Press books, this book is engaging, covers the concept in depth, has good examples, and has relatively fewer errors. Therefore I give it 5-years, which it richly deserves.After reading the book once I sat and passed the 642-642 with flying colors. This is how good the book is. I now also feel confident about the QoS section on the CCIE written exam."
1,A real pain to use this suitcase,"I liked the looks of the case, and the color was perfect and the price was very reasonable--$80. I rolled it around the store a little bit and then made the purchase. The trouble started as soon as I packed it for my first trip. Impossible to figure out how to get it to stay balanced. It's forever tipping, dipping, and mainly not rolling smoothly. No wonder it was on a half price sale! Anyone want it? It's yours, just tell me where to send it!"
1,"Very well written, but belongs in the fiction section","Professor Esposito is yet another Muslim apologist. Dr. Ali Sina of faithfreedom.org has challenged Dr. Esposito multiple times to debate him over whether Islam is really a religion of peace, or whether it is a religion of hate and intolerence. Dr. Esposito has never accepted Dr. Sina's challenge. If you really want to learn the truth about Islam, I recommend Ibn Warraq's book ""Why I am not a Muslim"". I also recommend ""The Crisis of Islam"" by Bernard Lewis (Lewis is another apologist, but he is brutally honest about some of Islam's more hateful teachings.) Remember, Islam is not a religion of peace, but that doesn't mean we need war with Muslims. Muslims are the primary victims of Islam. We can win without war if scholars like Dr. Esposito were only honest and able to convince Muslims that their religion is a lie."
5,WOW this should wake you up!,"I was afraid this digital clock would be on the weak side as far as the alarm. Westclox is an excellent company but....well, I set the alarm. Beep beep..not enuf to wake me up if really tired. Then a loader beep beep...much better then WOW...that will wake you up...a continuous sound I guess that goes on forever or until turned off or the battery dies. Easy to set, easy to read and with a snooze button. Seems to keep good time. Two AAA batteries, not included."
2,Mixed results,Got a couple of these a few months ago. One of them is still running. The other one conked out showing incorrect times plus not showing certain digits like 6 and 8. The journey to find the right timepiece with alarm continues. Marching on...
2,Not Travel Friendly,"Bought this for world travel, however, the strange shape makes it cumbersome for packing in the backpack. Works good on the nightstand at home, but for packing, find a more compact model."
2,Lacking an inportant yet simple feature,I don't know how many such alarm clocks I've bought over the years... Half a dozen I guess. This is the first one that doesn't have a 12/24 hours switch.
1,Another Shame-on with a fraudulent record,"As a mixed-blood (Cherokee/Peoria/White) Native American I watched this video with some high expectations. After all, presenting our philosophy to others can only benefit Creation. I have friends in several different tribes and know that all traditions vary to some degree. There was some good information presented in this video. It did have a definite New-Age flavor to it but that is not, in itself, all bad. I would caution all viewers to do some research on this Two-Birds fellow. I have NEVER known a Native American introduce themselves without mentioning tribal affiliation. This information provides context for what is presented in that any given tribe will have specific beliefs and traditions. The only reason I took the time to write this is to caution people to always check out these ""indian medicine men"" before you get involved personally or finanacially....howa, wado!!"
3,purchased for a class,got book for a herbology altertative medicine course I took; have not used since taking the class; perhaps in future
2,Temporary,"We bought this thermometer a couple of years ago. Time to replace it. Not bad for a temporary outdoor temperature solution, but its rusted and then just starting falling apart. If you plan on buying a thermometer every couple of years, this is the one for you."
2,Looks nice but failed in less that a year.,"I bought one of these at Lowe's last year and it's a nice looking unit. However, after about 7 months the glass bulb broke and became useless. I'm in Houston so we don't have extreme weather so it shouldn't have failed."
3,Good but not much in the way of atmosphere,"Paul Dukas's Symphony in C major is truly a masterpiece, and I like it the best of all French symphonies. This performance is technically above reproach but interpretively leaves something to be desired. It is played so crisply and immaculately that it robs the music of atmosphere, and that is particularly fatal in the second movement Andante espressivo. For all the techinical precision, this performance ultimately lacks the kind of yearning intensity and romantic tendernes that this music clamors for. Jean Martinon's classic version (EMI) still remains a first choice. Jean Fournet's live recording with Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra is also recommendable."
3,publisher's weekly got carried away,"this is the second mrs. mallory i read. i usually like to read the first in any series, if i don't start with it.i found nothing 'oddly poignant' about this very slender mystery. most of the people are unpleasant, or spineless, or obnoxious. mrs. mallory herself is unrealistic--we are asked to believe that a middle-aged woman who has achieved a university degree, brought up a child successfully, and writes scholarly works that are academically admired is, nevertheless, a hesitant, tentative doormat. phui.the main clue to the identity of the murderer is fairly obvious.i have read three of this series, and i will not be reading any more. this sets what seems to be the pattern: the murder victim is an unpleasant woman whose death is greatly deserved, and the murderer is an unpleasant woman who is only marginally sympathetic.there are better contemporary cozy british mystery series written by women. cynthia harrod-eagles springs to mind."
2,Super glue like lids,"I wrote a review prior to this but do not see it posted which is good cause after further use I've discovered these are pretty crappy. One of the two I ordered the lid broke apart when I UN-screwed it the first time. I moved on and when I attempted to use the 2nd, the lid would not budge! After getting it off and barely even closing it, it became stuck again. It's like someone painted the inside with crazy glue. For $1 it's not too bad, but don't expect it to use it for anything long term."
1,Not up to par.,"This lazy susan is wobbly. The center of it had deep scratches for about 1"" diameter. Disappointed."
4,Now you can find out how Bill gets away with so much!,A fascinating account of the Clintons and how they were able to slip through the noose so often! A lovable rogue with many qualities and a powerfull wife! This is an excellent set.
1,Overpriced,I already ordered these to use as decorations for a birthday party. I found them the next day at Dollar Tree for $1 per package! And it cost $5 per package on here!
2,"Myopic, cynical, deterministic, linear","The first reviewer said it all better than I could, but I'd just like to add that it's an ultimately cynical book, with its thinly veiled implication that CEOs cannot, will not, and should not embrace an ecologically friendly vision, nor consider their beneficial role in the local community and the larger supply chain.Reinhardt cites some of the worst corporate citizens by any stretch of the imagination such as Monsanto, and gives footnote-ish lip service to the fact that they're ""controversial"". Too bad the word ""green washing"" isn't in his vocabulary but instead euphemisms such as ""redefining the market"". Right. Way to promote the status quo with self-fulfilling prophecy.Thankfully, this book is rated #383,000 in sales. I still can't get over that this was one of the texts for a class I took. Maybe it makes a good ironic choice?"
1,"The Wild Thornberry Movie, My name is Ashley Nugent","I think that this movie is very bad and I would never see it again. It does not have a meaning, it's ridiculous.Eliza talks to animals. Wow"
5,GreaT BOOK! Great piece of history. MuST ReAD for all!,"If you love american history by a great writer, PICK THiS BOOK UP! It is amazing, and he is a true american writer! Great pictures, great stories, you will never put the book down. Dont mind that I am his nephew, im really not that biased!"
2,Disappointed!,I love Gold Toe socks and have been buying them for years. I ordered the crew socks in black months ago. There is neverending lint that has not washed out after months of use. I have washed them inside out as well but there is still lint left on my feet and on my carpeting when I remove them after wearing. I'm really unhappy with these socks and would not recommend them.
3,Gold Toe Women's Athletic Sock,"I purchsed size 9-11 of this item [Gold Toe Women's 3-Pack Comfort Crew Athletic Sock in Black]. I wear a size 8 athletic shoe. The socks were just what I was looking for, and they fit OK, but snuggly. I always wash things before I wear them. After washing according to the directions, the socks were very tight, and one sock had come apart at the stiching where the heel portion is sewn to the rest of the sock...leaving a hole. That was only one flaw out of many socks, but you might be more satisfied if you purchase a slightly bigger size than you normally wear."
3,Not what they used to be,"I agree, that gold toe socks are not what they used to be. They used to last for many years. Eventually, the heels faded and wore thin--never the toes. The toes of the new socks wore right thru. The old ones were all cotton, rather than the blend. I'd be interested in knowing what happened re: the quality we used to experience. New ownership?"
5,Ladies Gold Toe,"These socks are great. They are not binding. They're cushiony soft. Even after many wears, they aren't sliding down and so far, no holes.I'm on my feet all day and have worn holes in socks in just 3 wears. They've held up to the wear/tear I put socks through. My feet seem to hurt less when I wear these."
4,An eye opening journey,At first this book came across as cheeky and irreverent. I came to respect the amount of research that went into the search. I've been told that the description of Iranians is dead on accurate. With this book the journey is the reward not the destination. It seems like the author sort of ran out of things to do in Iraq and couldn't come up with a majestic enough way to shut down such a ominous challenge as searching for the birth of Jesus
2,Cute but NOT accurate ... or even close!,Cute little item but off by at least 4 degrees .... that's a whole bulb off; useless as a thermometer.Very disappoining performance.
3,neat,"I love galileo thermometers. I think they are so neat. This one came in a box that looked like it was from 1970. It was obviously packed well enough, though, because after it was shipped to me, I shipped it somewhere else and it didn't break! So, the product itself was as expected. Neat!"
4,Young children will LOVE Noddy!!,"My 3-year old loves Noddy!!! He gets excited when I put in the DVD and he starts to dance and sing the song. Unfortunately, the DVD does not start out like the TV show by playing the introduction song. It goes directly into the episodes. This is the only reason I did not give it the 5 stars.The DVD is noted to have English and Japanese as the audio options; however, English is the only audio language. You do have a section where a few words of multiple languages are introduced which is nice.All in all, this is a great DVD for the young ones."
4,Where are you now,I think this is the group I saw in person a few years back with Shirley Caesar and they were awesome!! Where are they now?
5,good quality socks,"Good quality. My son loves them, even though the giraffe socks are pink at the top!"
3,A different story,"This is a beautifully illustrated story about a little girl on a fantastic animal cruise. If you want a lovely book with gorgeous pictures of animals, you'll like this book. If you want to teach your child about the Noah of Genesis, look instead at the wonderful Noah's Ark by Peter Spier. That book also has lovely illustrations, but sticks much closer to the Biblical version of the story."
5,Second Copy as Gift,This is the second book I purchased; this one as a Christmas gift. I like the recipes I've tried quite a bit thus got it as a gift for someone else.
1,I hate this book!!!!!!,I have quite a few cookbooks in my collection and received this one last Christmas. I have tried 4 recipes in it all of which are not that good. Funky flavors and weird ingredients. I would definitely not recommend this one unless you enjoy throwing out the food you cook and wasting money and time.
4,Expectations vs Reality,"I originally thought that the book was MORE on airgun operation, types, problems, etc. Of course it it a history of many airguns and their parent companies; to that end, it was very readable."
5,Astonishingly thorough,"Cyril Aldred was one of the greatest Egyptologists of our time. In ""Akhenaten: King of Egypt"" he has left us his greatest legacy. This book reads as if you are right there. It is a mix between a volume for specialists, and an interesting detective novel. There are 107 excellent illustrations, both photographs and drawings, to compliment the wonderfully comprehensive text. A must have for anyone interested in Egypt, or in the world's first monothiest."
4,Akhenaten The One and Only,"Akhenaten and his ideals are very innovative and thought provoking to say the least. I can truly identify with this and he is my FAVORITE Pharaoh. This book is enlightening and somewhat informative. I am a researcher and had knowledge about the majority of the information within the covers of this book. Nonetheless, this is a nice edition to anyone's Egyptian book collection."
2,It's no fish,"After my daughter had so much fun with the reef fish (which I highly recommend), I thought the turtle would provide enjoyment as well. Unfortunately, it's no fish. The movement is minimal making it less interesting, it's sluggish in the water, and when you grab any of the fins, they get bent wrong and have to be bent back. It's ONLY redeeming value is she learned to say ""turtle"". Buy the reef fish instead, you won't be disappointed."
2,lame,The fish are cool but this turtle is lame. It only swims on the surface and the movement is not great. The only thing i like about this turtle is carrying it to the puclic pool and people look at you weird... they probably think it's cool but once it's in the water it's a waste a battery power.
1,Ughh..This score is terrible.,"This is one of most disappointing fantasy scores I have listened to. A lot of tedious filler cues with an occasional rousing trumpet solo in cues like ""Sailing"" to keep me from dozing off. Jeff Rona is a talented guy who can pull off way better scoring than this. Just check out his score Traffic: The Miniseries or Chicago Hope or White Squall if you can get that score. And what is up with all these positive reviews on the Amazon Earthsea page? Many of the critiques read off like public relations pieces with marketers pretending to be customers. That is not only dishonest and corrupt but illegal. >:("
5,"Keep ""Sending Up the Praise""",I love this C.D. I listen to it everyday. There is a song on there for everyday of the week and for every type of person. The harmonies and melodies spring forth to one's ear like the majestic sounds of bells. For an unprofessional and musically untrained choir these kids have done an excellent job on this album. I suggest everyone pick up a copy of this C.D. and request that your hometown radio stations play it and your music shops sell it. It is worth every penny.
1,arrived broken,Opened package that was not damaged and the clock's insides were rattling in the box. Plastic but looked nice. But the insides were unhooked from all the controls. Returned same day as arrived.
1,Overpriced and Not a Source of Recipes,"The title and the packaging suggest that this box is filled with recipes for infants and toddlers. Unfortunately, this has very few recipes. These are high gloss index cards with nutrition information. These index cards are very impractical for reading because if the cards go out of sequence you can't make sense of the reading. My toddler took the cards out of the box and I don't have time to reorganize the cards back in sequence! So instead of helping me save time as this bistro box claims to do, it has given me more mess to clean. I threw out the cards and now use this as a very expensive recipe box."
4,The Dreams of Ants,"Ron Campise's latest thriller mines some new territory in exploring how hero Steve Lomeli balances on spiritual underpinnings in his rebellion against the dark government forces that seek to derail his life and career.Often in contemporary literature, spirituality condemns a character to defenslessness and it is refreshing to follow the adventures of a character who confidently wields extranatural resources to defend his right to walk the world in peace."
1,Old jokes and urban legends,"Oh God, what a waste of time. Look at this:1) This is supposed to be funny: a woman was attacked by a chimp that escaped the zoo (so?)2) Darwin Awards wanna-be stories: a man got a fish stucked on his mouth and died.3)The WORST of all: Urban Legends!!!!!!!Examples: the story about the lady that cannot find the 11 at her phone (as in nine-eleven), the man who got his penis stuck in the drain and, worst of all, the VERY OLD and false story about the guy who throws a cigarrette inside the toilet after his wife used insecticide in it (the reaction was an explosion).That third point ruins the whole book, because it breaks the credibility of the other stories.Avoid this book. I assure you that you will regret purchasing it."
3,good but...,"I live in Louisiana and purchased my Mini sun shade to keep my car, a 2005 Cooper S, from burning up in the hot Louisiana summer sun. I thought that a genuine ""Mini"" part made specifically for the Mini would fit perfectly. But it doesn't, even though I was careful to buy the correct part for the specific model and year. The fact is, my Mini sun shade is kind of small and barely stays in place. The only way i've been able to make it stay in place is to roll up the pouch that it comes with, and jam it between the dash and windshield in order to prop the shade up into place. One should not have to do that. Otherwise, it's made of good material and the Mini logo is really cool. But for such a poor fitting accessory, you might be just as well off buying a generic shade for half the price."
5,short but concise,"Wow! Talk about packing a big punch in a small fist. This one is a knockout; a homerun. I am in the process of writing a novel series and boy am I kicking myself that this book was not in my hands earlier. There are at least 50 books on my shelf on writing and this one might be the smallest but it is the biggest in usefulness. It does not cover topics in great detail but from an overall picture, it gives you all you need to write a great novel. I am going over what I have already written with this comb to get the knots out. It may hurt and snag on some strands but I am 100% sold on this books method. This book has really given me hope, so look for my breakout epic fantasy novel sometime in the future.By the way, all that talk about hair is just wishful thinking; I am foliclely challenged. Oh, how I remember those days of the need to comb my hair."
3,A disappointment,"I bought this book at the King Arthur Flour baker's shop and Education Center in Norwich Vermont (the place where the author teaches) and I was excited to try to improve my bread baking skills. Unfortunately, although the author may be a master baker he is not a master writer. While interesting, the book is often confusing. More time is spent on the science of bread than on teaching the specifics of the steps that are required to produce great tasting loaves. I recently purchased a different book by a different top baker and found that I was suddenly learning *what* alongside of *why* and the first batch of dinner rolls I created were far better than anything I had been able to achieve by studying Hamelman. At the very least, this book is not the best text for the home baker. It seems far more geared to bakers or chefs."
2,keep your culture cosy?,"lots of good info from a well-experienced baker;but on page 355,the author quotes another baker,stating that yeast dies under 8 degrees celsius..really? so when I refrigerate my sourdough culture at 4 degrees celsius only bacteria survive?A statement like that needs to be scientifically authenticated to be authoritative."
2,Bread Book,I had to return this item as it had measurements for bakery amount bread and I will order the Bread Bible which is more for the average house wife.
5,The family is travaling by wagon. Run into many obstcals.,The book was very good. I'm a kid and I thought I was perfect at paining a picture in your mind. If you like discripive sorys try this one!!
2,Repeat Repeat Repeat,These are great books...don't get me wrong. But I bought the large set and this set thinking that I would get something different.Every book was a repeat of books from the larger set...and nothing in the description let me in on this little secret.Fortunately they are good enough to give away for Christmas gifts!
2,Very theoretical in nature with no practice exercises,"This book is one long essay. It goes over the head for moderately competent VB programmers.This book suffers from a total absence of practice examples. Although it is comprehensive in style and offers great tips, it glosses over fundamental issues such as creation of menus. I had communicated with the author. His advice to master VB was practice and practice. Advice that his book ignores completely. I had the computer on while reading this book and never once had an opportunity to use the computer.I returned the book after just 5 chapters and got my money back."
3,It's okay,You can't really see the detail of the shells.. So I'm hoping that once I actually make the mold it just doesn't look like a pile of rocks.. They are small so if you are using them for cupcakes you can put about 3 or four on the cupcake..It wasn't costly so no big deal. If you aren't super picky it will do the job ;)
5,no thanks,STILL ADDING ALL MY OLD SONG TO MY COLLECTION ALMOST HAVE THEM ALL STILL HAVE ALITTLE MORE TO BUY WHEN I HAVE THEM ALL I WILL STOP ORDERING MUSIC.
2,Flimsy,"I liked the container that the cheese falls into, but the plastic around the individual grating plates is flimsy and broke quickly. Not recommended."
4,It Grates Cheese into a Bin!,"I love freshly grated cheese. I hate the mess that goes with that.This product does exactly what it claims to do, grates and catches. There is a little bit of shavings that find their way outside of the bin from the top but it's not a big deal.The different attachments work well and are all dishwasher safe which was a huge selling point for me.My only gripe is one of the graters has a crack on the white plastic outer ring. I'm not sure if it's come from use or from the high heat of the dishwasher. The crack does NOT affect how well the grater works and it doesn't seem like it's going to get any worse from there so it's not a big deal."
4,Great but not perfect,"I have bought two of these graters as they seem to be the best deal for the money (my 1st one still works perfectly fine, my fiancé has it as we don't live together anymore). I like to bake and cook a lot with my fiancé which means we use these a lot. While there are much better graters, they also cost several times as much and as a grad. student, these are more than good enough. My biggest gripe with the grater is the zesting plate which most of the zest gets stuck between the wholes and you have to scrape them out ( I make a lot of key lime pies and spend a long time doing this). Besides that this thing does a great job and has a nifty measuring container. If you are trying to save some money for now, buy one of these."
5,"""Great grater!""","Grating foods horizontally rather than vertically (as on a box grater) is fabulous, especially for someone who has any type of hand or wrist problems.Choose the blade you want, slide it in, and grate away....carefully! It's quite sharp, which is what you want for this device.The grips on the bottom of the box held the grater well while I was working, and I prefer to just quickly wash it by hand when I'm done, so I haven't tried it in the dishwasher. Love that all the pieces fit neatly into the box.Sure, a little of the cheese or grated veggies get on the counter, but no more so than with any other type grater. Cooking is messy, anyway, and cleanup is just part of it!Considering the features and the price of this set, this is a good buy!"
4,Grater Set,Unit works great and as expected. The plastic tray that the different grater pieces fit into works really better than expected and it doesn't scoot around on the counter top. Worth the money.
2,Alarm clock disappointment,I ordered this clock as my sister in law wanted an extra loud alarm clock. This clock does not measure up. It is inexpensive so will make a decent clock in the bedroom but it is not LOUD!
