4,Much better than expected ... AA and AAA batteries,"I have now purchased 3 of these. I bought them for 2 nieces and 1 nephew. The 3 year old has a little trouble with the controls, but the 4 year old is handling the controls well. A little different controls from normal RC; the controls are track (left-side, right-side) controls ... so both forward if forward, both back is back, left forward right center is right turn, left forward right back is fast right turn, opposite for left turns ...The batteries were a surprise: the controller uses aaa, the vehicle uses aa ... so make sure you get both sizes.The great part is that these are fun for even adults, when the kids put these down, the adults still wanted to play.Tough ... YES... these are inexpensive, so I didn't stop the 4 year old when she kicked this over obstacles it could not climb. Even after abuse, no damage.Wheels have little tred on tires, is not an off road vehicle, concrete, tile, burber, that's about it. Water not yet tried."
3,ok for the price,not good on bumpy ground. only on smooth surfaces and hard ground so if you live on rock it probably will work good. haven't tried the water feature yet but again would have to be a designed track for this. like the one in the video demo for this.
5,Lasts and Lasts,This RC car is virtually indestructible. We have purchased both our boys one over the years. Its great for 3+ as a first RC toy. Great toy at a great price! Moms & dads will enjoy playing with this one!
5,"Gator Radio, RC Car, Little Kids RC","Gave this as a Xmas Gift, Said to be very durable and fun for young ones as their first RC. Good Quality and design. And supposedly very very fun for young boys."
1,Piece of Junk!,"The engineers over at Kid Galaxy have designed an amazing toy that works out of the box, but magically degrades after a week or 2. (I assume this shoddy formula saves them money.) Returned the first one for a replacement. And guess what? The 2nd one stopped working after a few weeks. So now there's a piece of non-working junk sitting at the bottom of my kid's toy box."
2,"Boy, this is pretty basic stuff","If you've just bought a boat and you have this notion to go off cruising, this may be a fun book to feed your mind. But it's awfully basic. Gleckler does take you by the hand and deals with the most fundamental questions. But there's no real ""beef"" in this volume. You'll need to read a lot more than you'll find in here. And the photographs are just AWFUL. Why is it acceptable to print photographs in a book that are so dark it's impossible to see what's going on?"
4,Great tub for a great price!,"I like this tub for the same reasons other moms like it; the infant sling worked great! We received two tubs at my shower, so we keep one at home and one at my mother-in-law's home. She has this one, and I noticed that it was easier than the one I have at home because she has support from both sides. We have to put not too much water since she has started to splash all over the place. So we started to give her baths in the bathroom tub. My daughter seems to enjoy it, so I would recommend it to others out there."
4,Great Item,"I've used this tub with my newborn for four months now. I've never seen the plug change color (but I do use the color change rubber duck), and it fits wonderfully in my sink. My daughter is about to outgrow it, but it's nice for a quick bath in the sink when I don't feel like bending over the bath tub. The sling was a nice feature when she was a newborn, and needed sponge baths. I just turn it over in my tub to dry, and I love the skid pads."
4,Review Sure Comfort Deluxe Tub by Marlene,"Nice and spacy for my baby, who is 6 months and can now REALLY enjoy a bath, by SPLASHING or RELAXING in his bathtub. As baby can sit up they still have the option to lie or sit up while taking a bath. I am very content. One minus point is cleaning the bathtub since it has holes and corners which have to be wiped off well(to avoid fungus growth)."
5,Big Girl Tub!,She loves her bath in this tub. I can wash her hair and she feels secure and wants to play. I like the stopper so I can let the water out when I am finished. I can sit it in the regualr bathtub or over the kitchen sink. This works just great.
5,Great bath tub!!,"I didnt use the sling with this tub, but it works great as a regular tub. I put it in the bathtub and its wonderful. The heat sensor on the plug is really great, I tested it out and it worked really well. I love this tub. The nonskid pads are really nice for keeping a slippery baby in place, too."
1,Didn't work for us.,"I bought this tub after reading all the great reviews, and was very disappointed. The newborn mesh helped somewhat to keep the baby above the water, although she seemed quite uncomfortable in it. Now, that we use it as a toddler tub, it is a nightmare. The ""hump"" that is supposed to keep the child from sliding down, is useless. She slides down. And last night she leaned forward, fell out of the tub, and the tub toppled on top of her. Will not be using it again."
3,there's not enough room,"This is a great tub for babies that are newborn-3 months old. I would highly recommend it for infants. But for babies that like to kick and splash, there's just not enough room. They end up kicking the hard plastic edges. My son is now 3 months old, of average length and weight- and this tub is just too small for him now, even though it is advertised as an infant to toddler tub!"
4,Easy to use tub,"I bought this tub when my daughter was 4 months old. I have loved it since. It's quite convenient and easy to use and clean. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I wish the water would drain better. I usually have to lift the tub up a little on one side so the water can drain quicker. Otherwise, this tub worked perfectly for me for year and a half."
2,Son cries every time I put him in the sling,"My son cried every time I put him in the sling. It also didn't hold him up very well, he was constantly sliding down. I finally threw away the sling, bought one of those bear shaped foam cushions, and placed it in the tub opposite of the toddler side and he does much better. But if I could do it all over again I would have bought a different tub."
4,pretty good,"We chose this tub after reading the reviews. In comparison, this is definately a great tub. But, if I were to do it again, I probably wouldn't even buy a baby tub. The sling would be good for before the umbilical cord falls off, but we used a bath mat on the counter for her sponge baths. We used the inclined side until about 6 months when she could sit up on her own. It was great for that. It did fit in our kitchen double sink, but the faucet had to be behind it, and so it was hard to get to the running water. I ended up just putting this tub into our big bathtub and bending over the side. That worked pretty well. Once our daughter could sit up I tried putting her on the other side, but it was too hard to reach her back and underneath her, so now she just sits in the big tub."
2,Save Your Money,"I don't know why people are raving about this tub. I think it's just horrible. I bought one for my son before he was born. He is 4 months old now, and I'm looking for a new tub to buy. I did like the hammock feature with this tub, but that's the only good aspect. (Hence two stars instead of just one.) My son slides all over the place in this tub on the infant side. It's just a poor design. The green padding is not mold/mildew resistant. I wipe down the tub with soap every day and let it air dry after using it, but it's still starting to smell. I tried ripping off some of the padding, unfortunately it doesn't come off well. I would recommend a different design without padding."
3,It's ok for a little one,"It's ok for a little one but once my baby reached about 4 months, she played and splashed so much, she grew out of it. She has long legs and they reach the toddler side now. She slips around way too much because the bump on the bottom is too small and doesn't come up enough. She's almost gone under a couple times if I hadn't been there. The water doesn't cover her enough. It's ok for little ones but I don't recommend it as they get older. Plus, mine doesn't fit in my sink."
2,More hassle than it's worth,This is the first tub I had for my baby and I found it more of a hassle than it would have been to hold her in the tub with me. I constantly had to hold her head so she didnt let it drop off to the side and hit the side of the tub. She would constantly scoot down until her ears were under water so i was forever sliding her back up. I just didnt like it
2,an okay tub,Let me start by saying I loved the hammock feature. But now that my son is almost 4mo old he's too big for the hammock and he just seems uncomfortable in the tub.
2,Nice Tub but my baby did not like . . . . .,I got this tub as a gift and it was nice . . . . or so I thought. My son did not like it at all. I guess he didn't like how it laid back. He wanted to feel like he was sitting up. The caddy and the container to rinse baby is very nice. I would say shop around and see what your baby prefers.
3,Liked it but would not recommend,I like this particular tub but I found one fatal flaw-whoever designed it put the drain on the bottom of the tub flush with the tub or sink. To drain out excess water or drain period you end up spilling or having to bail out the water with a cup. I find the tubs with the drains on the sides work much better with less mess.
5,Great purchase!,"I looked at a lot of tubs before settling on this one. No regrets. My baby has a bath every evening as part of our bedtime routine and it is so great. It fits right over your sink so your back is saved and all the water just splashes/drains into the sink below. Also, it was ironically the cheapest tub. Ahhh...I love when that happens."
4,I wish that I had this from the start.,"This is my second tub for my baby. The other was fine until she hit about 3 months, after that she needed a larger one. This one is great for all stages. She can even sit up. It would have saved me a little money to just get this one from the start."
4,Secure- but hard to clean,"I like the fact that you can support your newborn on the sling and you don't have to give him/her a sponge bath on the counter. It's also nice that there are two different ""sitting"" positions (one side for babies who can't sit up yet and one side for those who can). The only complaint I have is with the leg design. The legs are hollow and part of the tub basin, so bathwater sits in them. This would be fine if they were bigger, but they are too narrow to get your fingers far enough into them to reach the bottom to clean...and the bottom is where the mold/mildew collects. I usually have to use an old toothbrush to push a cloth into the legs to get the buildup out. If they would block off the legs so water didn't get into them, the tub would be perfect:)"
2,If I had to do it over again...,"I wouldn't have bought this bath tub. As a newborn my daughter was really uncomfortable with the ""bump"" in the middle of the tub. We all know that bathing a newborn isn't easy because of the gentle movements needed in bathing and we found that the ""bump"" just got in the way.But as a toddler it worked perfectly. I would just fill this tub up after putting it into our big bath tub. Worked great."
4,A good tub for the price,"I'm a first time mom and had my daughter 3 months ago. We received this tub as a shower gift and have been using the tub for a while. It does the job, but like most products it has its pros and cons.Pros:- Can be used from infant to toddler- Infant-sling support baby well enough- Drain hole on the bottom makes emptying water easy- Decent tub for the priceCons:- Infant keeps sliding off the seat and infant sling, so parent needs to frequently readjust baby- The Infant-sling keeps baby almost completely out of the water, so baby gets cold quickly- leaves very little area for parent to scoop water to bath baby when baby is seated in the tub- Doesn't fit on all bathtubs and/or sinks."
5,Great!,"Love this tub. It's easy to use, clean, dry. After each use I empty it and lean it on it's side to dry - very easy. Like the hammock feature. Really like the area at the end for the clean water - makes it easier and faster to rinse a crying baby. The only negative that I can think of is the size for storage."
2,baby doesn't sit well,"I chose this tub because it had the two different sitting positions. However, as soon as I started using it, I noticed that my son didn't sit up against the back- his lower back and butt sat more on the hump than in the scooped area. I tried to put a rolled towel to take up the space, but that just maked him slide down into the water- too dangerous for me. He never seemed uncomfortable being perched on the hump, but after his bath, I noticed that he would have a red mark on his back and butt from all the pressure. Needless to say, I bought a new tub and he loves it- he smiles all the way through his baths instead of looking at me like I'm doing something bad (I'm taking this as a sign that the other tub made him uncomfortable.)"
4,Good seat,This seat worked great while my daughter was little but when she reached around 21 inches and wasn't even a year yet it became difficult even if she sat in the toddler end of the tub. I would still recommend this and it fits perfectly in a single or double sink. I also like the feature where the plug turns white if the water is too hot. I would recommend this.
2,Not for my baby...,"This tub did not work well for my baby and we had to take it back. I thought that the molded seat would keep him in place, but he would simply just slide down over it and the raised lip would be poking him in the back. I think for other smaller and less active babies, it might work well. But, it just wasn't for us."
2,Unneeded Product,"The quality of this product is fine but we only used it 2 or 3 times and now it's just taking up a lot of space. It was comfortable for Baby but baby bath tubs in general are a hassle to set up and clean up and store. We find it easier to simply have Baby bathe with Mommy or Daddy. This was something we certainly could have done without. If you're on a budget, we'd recommend asking around for a safe baby bath tub like this one to borrow as we suspect most folks don't use them very long."
3,Good for baby under 3 months.,"I got this tub for my baby shower. It was great in the beginning with the sling, but now it is uncomfortable for her. My daughter is 4 1/2 months old and she is too big for the reclining seat, but too small for the straight upright seat (it is completely verticle!). I still am bathing her in the reclining seat, but I have to have one hand holding her bottom or else she slips right over the bump.The bump is not high enough to hold a babys bottom. Also, she kicks really hard (she loves to play), but the tub is not long enough, so she ends up just pushing on th edge with her feet. Anyway, it is not bad, just too small for a baby that wants to play and have fun in the tub without mommy holding their bottom the whole time."
5,Lily's momma,"Great tub!! This tub was great for spong baths because it comes with a sling so the first baths are a lot easier then having to hold a wet squrimy baby. Once we could give her a real bath the tub held her great. Bath time is one of her favorite times, she just loves splashing around in it!"
4,Great infant tub,"Handy tub. Fits well in the kitchen sink for my newborn. The sling is soft and comfy. The only issue we have is space for it to dry, but if you have a large tub or live in a warm area you wouldn't have a problem with it."
2,No more than 2 stars,"I don't know why so many people love this tub! The first time I used it, it leaked all over... I mean soaked everything! Now my babies are older and I no longer need the sling and my babies (I have twins) and constantly sliding down! I have to always have to keep a hand on them. The also always slide to the side. They are 7 months old and have great head control, so it is obviously the design of the tub. I regret this purchase and wish I had a different tub for these last 7 months."
3,Good for newborns but not for infants,This tub proved to be good while my son was under 6 months but now he has outgrown it. Even the toddler side is too small for him to sit comfortably. I also found that the plug does not turn color when the water is too hot and I rely on a bath thermometer instead.
5,Excellent!,"I put this tub in my registry, and it was the best option. It's very easy to shower my baby, and the little craddle gives extra support for a newborn. Definetely, is the tub to buy!!"
4,Great Tub for Babies Who Sit Unassisted,"The first tub I owned was only for newborns/infants who need to recline in the tub. I never realized that we would need a differnt tub once he started to sit up and would no longer want to recline in the bath. I have given this product a 4 rating because I have not used the sling feature. Otherwise, it seems to be well constructed. I have been very happy with most First Years products that I have used."
1,Stressful bath time,"This looked like a a great tub to purchase. The sling was very appealing to me. Initially I thought the tub was great. It fit great over the kitchen sink, and my newborn cuddled nicely in the sling. However once sponge bathing was over and I began to add water to the tub, my baby was slipping out of the sling. No matter what adjustment I made to the sling, it was not working to keep my baby in place. I took the sling out and there was no improvement. The shape of the tub is so awkward. The water comes up high near the baby's mouth, and I am always concerned about water being swallowed. I added a teddy bear sponge to the bath and that helped out minimally. Maybe once my baby is sitting up on his own, the toddler side of the tub will work, but I am not waiting until then. I am getting rid of it right now. Bath time should be fun and right now bath time is just stressful."
4,Great tub for a newborn!,"This tub was WONDERFUL when my son was a newborn. HE LOVED IT! It has a sling that fit onto it so that when your child is just a few weeks to a month old, he wont fall in too deep. It also fits on your sink perfectly!However, by the time my son was 3 1/2 months old he was WAY TOO BIG for the tub and we had to move him to the real bathtub! Even though the tub has differant ""seats"" for infant and toddler I dont see how ANY toddler could actually fit in it... especially with the way they like to play and kick in the water!! :)I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this bathtub for anyone who is looking to use it for a newborn. You will get a good 3 months out of it (maybe a little more)... but dont plan on using it through the toddler years.. Its just not big enough!"
5,Love this tub,I love this tub because it is easy to use. It fits great in my sink and has a little basin to keep clean water in. My daughter fit securely on the sling when she was a newborn and now at 3 months old doesn't have problem reclining in the tub. It does not leak or cause any mess. The only problem I have is storing it but that would probably be the case with most tubs or anything else this size.
5,Awesome Infant Tub,"This infant tub has made bath time enjoyable for both baby and us(parents). The hammock was perfect for the first couple of months! We were able to secure our little boy in the hammock and have two free hands to do the bathing. Now he has outgrown the hammock and still loves it. I saw one review saying the plug did not change colors with ""hot"" water, but ours works. As a first time mom, this was a wonderful feature. I have heard horror stories from mothers that did not know about this tub. I definitely recommend it."
5,Long lasting tub!,"We've had this tub from day 1! The hammock was great to do sponge baths with--we would put hot water in the tub and the steam kept our son warm. We have used this tub every night as part of our bedtime routine since those first baths. (My son is now a year old.) We thought about moving him to the big tub, but since we live in drought ridden Colorado--this one just makes sense (it saves water!) We definitely got our money's worth and still are!"
5,BEST tub,This bathtub is great! It fits perfectly over the kitchen sink or you can set it on the bathroom counter. We used it for my son until he was about 8 months old. I recommend this tub to all my friends who are having babies and to anyone needing to buy a baby shower gift for someone.
3,Worked well but didn't last long,"This tub worked well for the first 4 months. Our son was 5 weeks early but we only used the hammock for the first bath - it just didn't appear to be sturdy enough. The recline position allowed our son to splash and have fun in the bath but he seemed uncomfortable where his bottom rested against the raised plastic area meant to keep baby in position. Since he was still too young to sit upright but obviously uncomfortable on the recline side we retired this tub and moved to a bath tub cushion which works great.If I could go back in time I don't think I would purchase this tub again, but there was nothing wrong with the product itself."
3,pretty good unless you have my little guy.,"We were given this tub from a friend and we were thankful because it was great. my lil guy loved being in the tub we would give him two baths a day but since hes gotten older, he is a very active lil stinker and he likes to push against the other backboard and gets his butt off the seat then slides in. even when im watching him hand and foot he does it and im scared that he will go under fully one of these times if im not fast enough. other than that it is very nice. just be careful if you have a hyper active boy like mine =)"
3,Best Tub for the Money,"I originally had added a more expensive shower tub to my baby registry, but then I read the reviews for this tub and everyone seemed to rate it better so I went with this one instead. I am glad I did. The sling is wonderful to use for a newborn and my baby boy seems to enjoy it as well because he can still feel the warmth of the water without being fully submerged. The only problem I have with this tub is that after only a handful of uses, the sling is smelling moldy. This does not make sense to me since I am very good about draining the tub completely and airing it out between uses. I have started spraying the sling down with Lysol in between uses to make sure that mold doesn't occur. For this reason I am only giving this tub 3 stars."
2,Wrestling to Keep Baby Upright,"The sling option was nice for my newborn baby, but, as he got bigger I had to remove the sling because there was a big hump of plastic jabbing him in the back. Troubles started when he was an infant, his little body squirmed all over and I had to wrestle to keep his head up and not falling into the water and body from sliding.I would skip this tub and use bathe a newborn in the sink and then invest in a Primo tub. That is what I ended up buying and it is WONDERFUL."
3,"1/2 Holmes and 1/2 Poirot, a decent mystery story","Often wordy and requiring a little concentration, its style is reminiscent of the author's much more popular novel, Phantom of the Opera."
2,They went Bats.....,"Seeing Adam West and Burt Ward on this reunion show is like watching home movies of relatives you can not stand. Needless to say, this is largely a yellow journalism look back at the 1966 TV show, and features past actos in a not so favorable light, I never thought West and Ward would restort to political mud throwing, but they have."
1,Dave's update,"I promised an update. Still no TV. The customer service is atrocious. My credit card company is now trying to help me out with this problem. Buyer beware.....Amazon beware. This product/company is far to poor to be sold on this web site. I have never had a problem with Amazon. They are always curteous and genuinely want to help. Philips is full of rhetoric and B.S. No responses to e-mails, a dozen phone calls, and still no action. Next stop.......Better Business Bureau.P.S.Stay tuned"
4,Review,It was very inexpensive compared to other websites. Delivery date of item was a week late though.
4,"nice, a little knowledge helps","wikipedia says: Beeswax has a high melting point range, of 62 to 64 C (144 to 147 F). If beeswax is heated above 85 C (185 F) discoloration occurs.That's for melting into a liquid. You don't need to get it that hot to just move the wax without cracking it. They use beeswax for this for a reason.Try just going a little slow, or putting the candle someplace warmer if your house is colder. You can heat it a little (just a little) with a hair dryer to make it super flexible. It is very easy to make it too flexible.But even at room temp, if you you don't rush it, you can move 1"" segments into this without cracking the wax. In my experience.both the holder and the candle look nice and are a fun conversation piece. And also- much safer than a regular candle that is not self-regulating."
1,Better to buy a different candle,"These are beautiful candles, and a great conversation piece.Having said that, please don't buy one! The reason being that they are NOT being made in America with American beeswax. They are being made in other countries like China who have a very well-documented history of selling honey and beeswax contaminated with insecticides and herbicides.The candle is made from beeswax, and is extruded by machinery to make this coil shape. There are no manufacturers in the US making these with US wax. I would love to find one who does!How do I know? I am a beekeeper who uses wax from my hives to pour my own candles that I sell at farmer's markets. Yes, my products cost more than those made in China, but there's a reason for that, too.Google beeswax candles, and find a beekeeper and chandler near you, and help support American farmers, beekeepers, and small business!"
1,Worst zip ties in the world,"Why no one should ever buy these ties:1. On half of them the tooth that does the whole zip tie action doesn't actually clamp down properly. If you wiggle the loose end it'll release.2. Almost all of them are made of brittle plastic. If you need to tie something down and require a bit of force to get the thing tight, be prepared to waste 3 or 4 before you find a tie that simply doesn't snap in half every time you give it a hard pull.Completely useless, do not buy."
2,indoors only,great assortment of lengths and colors. Unfortunately they do not withstand cold temperatures. Very brittle in the cold. Not good for outdoor use. Had lots of success with them indoors.
2,Irony? Horror?,"Oh man, what a bad movie. But then, what exactly did they want with that movie from the beginning? It's pretty entertaining and reminded more of the Twilight zone stories but both stories and the stuff in between is light years away from the standart of both story tellers. I know 'the body politics' by Barker from the book 'inhuman conditions' in which much much better stories could've been taken into this short story movie.When all the separated neighbours' hands have a meeting on the rooftop (they're planning rebellion against the bodies, trying to convince other hands to get 'independant' by cutting themselves off the arms and enjoy freedom) at the climax of the second story, the protagonist decides to fake the hands and become their leader only to make them follow him when he jumps. Add some cartoon voices going ""wheeeeawhoooo"" (the screaming hands)... this movie has to be a joke. A funny twilight zone episode. A bad one."
5,I Aced the CCNA 2.0 Exam !!,I am one of the Technical Reviewers of the book. I myself prepared for the CCNA 2.0 exam using the pre-published copy of this Quick Review book and aced the exam in January this year! I also used the Sybex Study Guide.The major strength of this book is its organization. The quick review of exam objectives and quick review tables section in each chapter give a clear idea of what should be reviewed just before one proceeds to the testing center. More than 400 questions are exactly the type one gets in the real exam. The CD ROM has all the questions and detailed answers in the book in PDF format and are good for easy reading.The book serves as an excellent review book for the exam. I highly recommend it to all CCNA aspirants!!
4,I hope it's working,"I started using it not long ago, and can't tell for sure about it's immune system boosting properties. With combination with Nature's Way Elderberry Capsules it helps getting over a cold faster. Still have to use it more to be able to draw some conclusions."
2,Lousy for Kindle,"Parisi was an exceptional editor, and this book contains exceptional poems. However, on the Kindle the formatting is out of kilter. Different font sizes within a single poem, for example. It makes the text unreadable."
1,Men's Stainless Steel Medical ID Bracelet falls apart,"I am very disappointed in this product. I replaced my existing medical ID bracelet only after the face had been so scratched that it could not be read anymore. However, this old bracelet lasted me for 6 years. The bracelet I bought from you looked very similar but after 3 months, the Red Caduceus Medical Symbol fell off. I am very disappointed and would like it replaced."
1,The dangers of Irrationalism,"This is the Portuguese version of the global threat of contemporary irrationalism against science.Religion, terrorism, obscurantism, superficiality, New Age, postmodernism, dogmatism, and all fundamentalisms constitute altogether a powerful peril against Civilization.This sociology pretends to be a ""new science"". But it reduces to a meaningless verbose and disjointed ""discourse"" that pedantically quotes scientitific works (such as relativity theory or quantum mechanics) without understanding their exact physical and mathematical meaning.Hence, although it presents -- in this war between science and irrationalism -- an apparently insignificant contribution, it proves nevertheless that the enemies of reason are comfortingly established, pervading Academia (namely in the departments of, euphemistically called, ""soft sciences"")."
4,Goofy but Fun!,"We love Get Smart! The humor is a mix of slapstick and clever witticisms that make us laugh, though the drama isn't too heavy-it's all about the laugh. And there's hardly a thing that could be questionable for family watching, except that sometimes Smart himself makes faces at the ladies, or there might be a tall curvy girl in tight skirts. However the humor is clean and there's never any swearing. We love 99. She is a good, brave girl and for some reason puts up with Max's bumbling ways. And Siegfried is the most lovable bad guy ever!"
5,hard,"This game absolutley HAS to be the best game I have and I have about 100?Really Good stuff:-jedi (no duh)-space-better Galatic Conquest-the ""career"" I'm a cap'n-the magnaguards,clone commanders, imperial officers and Mustafarthe Bad junk:-the stupididty of the rebels (they take out pistols and shoot at dead stormtroopers, I mean, come on!)-no laying down-CIS too good space battlers-stupid demolititon award-annoying princess leiathat's it."
1,Over-hyped,"If you like console games (arcady feel, poor AI but with the flashy Star Wars characters and laser sounds) then you'll probably like this game. If not, and you are looking for a quality shooter (ala Battlefield2) this game just doesn't do it. I feel like these other reviews duped me into purchasing this one and will stick to PC Gamer magazine reviews for now on. For more mature, hard core PC Gamers I would recommend you stay aware from this one."
3,"Fun, But Not Worth The Money","Let me start by saying that this game was pretty fun to play and very enjoyable, but it's kind of a ripoff.First, if you enjoy doing space battles (on ships), you will be dissappointed, because almost all of them are exactly the same; take out the shield, blow up the ship, kill a few fighters. And the main ships are almost always in the exact same spot.Second, the game is kind of incomplete. I was so dissappointed after winning the battle on Hoth and seeing the credits start rolling. You see that the second death star is being built, and the game is over! I was able to beat it in 3 days!It's like they're trying to rip the customers off by making one game and splitting it into 3, so the company can make almost 3 times as much money.So basically, I would just reccomend renting this game, not buying it, at least not until the price goes down a lot."
3,Good but Too much like original,"The Game itself was okay with added space combat it really adds something new and the maps from the Episode III Movie is also nice, but the bottom line is this is a clone of the first in too many areas. I was hoping you could fly from space to planets surface with more freedom. If you never owned the original you will be amazed at the gameplay, everyone else will look at it as an expansion."
5,bed wedge foam slant with white cover,"This has been a true blessing. No more trying to pile up pillows just right to sleep without reflux. The wedge is high enough, long enough and provides enough support plus comes with a zip cover which is a savings."
2,"I wanna give you all the love I got, so come on!","This is probably the best Brady Bunch album, but that's not saying much. It does feature the bunch's three best songs; ""It's a Sunshine Day"", ""Keep On"" and ""Candy (Sugar Shoppe)"". Not that those songs are good, exactly, but they are fun in a campy kind of way. The rest of the album is pretty terrible, although the Godawful cover version of ""Love Me Do"" is good for a few laughs. The CD includes three bonus tracks from the wretched ""Chris Knight & Maureen McCormick"" album. This CD is for serious fans of the Brady Bunch only."
2,Blues Rock Harmonica Made Easy,"Yeah, this series is fine if you're looking for a book to help you learn, but what I really wanted was a songbook. Most of the songs in this are in every other learn-to-play book out there, so didn't expand my playlist.Also, it's not actually pocket sized. The long narrow shape suggests that it is small enough to stick in your pocket and carry around with your harp, but unstead it's oversized and unmanagable."
1,TOO BAD A TREE DIED FOR THIS DRECK!,"The author has definitely mastered the art - of the SCAM, that is. This book, and I'm assuming his other opuses on harmonica operation as well, has so little actual usable information in it as to make it a TOTAL WASTE OF PAPER. Unless you're stranded in a Forest Service outhouse and the roll is empty. Not only does he blather on for pages and pages saying absolutely NOTHING, but he introduces his inane ""system"" and constantly plugs his other publications. And by the way - I'll bet his real last name isn't ""Harp."" It's probably Shylock. Or Gump."
5,Advanced Piano Solos - Dan Coates,This book is very enjoyable and fun to play. The selections are very interesting and I feel like I'm actually improvising. I love the arrangements and look forward to practicing!
3,Best of the Decca Years,"For the Weavers lover, this is a must have. For someone wanting to discover the Weavers, the concert recordings are much better. On this album 1950s production met a small folk group and the result is very much a 50s sound. Big orchestra backing, instrumental choices that reflected the taste of the day rather than a folk approach. I prefer the Weavers as they stood on stage with their voices, their instruments, and their hearts out there for everyone to enjoy."
3,Super Close Shaver replacement head,The shaver head came very timely. I ordered 2 and one had a broken foil. I did not bother exchanging because I found a local place to purchase these bitems for a comparitive pricing.
3,"Good info, but beginners may want to look elsewhere","This has some excellent information on getting an agent, a demo tape, and some real inside dope on the business. It's also clear, and well-written. However, if you're like me--a complete novice--I'd suggest you look elsewhere. The authors (correctly) tell you to take voice lessons, and while they have a few helpful excerises, the book isn't much good for actually helping a beginner develop his or her talent. It's telling that the chapter on money comes two chapters before the one on ""Getting Talented."" In other words, the book is great for career advice and technical advice about the business, but not so great on helping one develop the tools to get there."
3,Turner is OK,"I found this turner from a search on the web. The photo showed a turner exactly like my ekco turner I currently use and love. They are hard to find so I went to the web for help. I'm disappointed in this turner. It is not as stiff of metal and my old one at home. Just flipping an egg caused the metal to bend. I'm sure it will not be going strong in 20 years and my current Ekco turner is. I was planning on keeping the 4 turners I purchased through Amazon for future use. Now, I think I use them and keep my 20 yr old turner for future use."
3,Not bad for third person shooter beautiful colorscheme,"Again i'm not a fan of third person shooters but this game wasn't half bad and i loved the colors in this game, its a good deal if you pick it up new for 5-7 bucks"
4,Not bad,Pretty decent but regular fps. Nice aspects- if you know the 2000 AD series and some of the special abilities such as sentry gun and holographic projection are neat.
1,Not for the Mac...,"This was advertised as a Mac platform game which it is not so I can't fairly rate this game as I cannot play it. I was, of-course, very disappointed."
2,Disappointing,"I had heard that this guy is tough. Well it certainly didn't show here.As an avid watcher/do-er of many many exercise dvds, I know what is motivating and appealing. This however is not one of those programmes. He's a bit on the boring side and a little flighty. I never understand why exercise dvds have a music soundtrack, if they aren't going to do repetitions to the beat. The timing is hickilty pickilty, and if you aren't watching the screen but listening to him babble instead, then you will be way off the amount of reps that the model does. That is frustrating. And why does he want the viewers brain to be in their stomach???DO NOT buy this dvd if you are intermediate or advanced. It is purley for beginners. It simply isn't challenging enough to be very beneficial to anyone over beginner level.If you are looking for better workouts, then almost anything else will be superior to this. Sorry David."
1,Do not waste your money,"I'm sorry, David Kirsch is no motivator like Billy Blanks or Kathy Smith...too basic and completely BORING. Do not waste your money- instead for a really good weights (all round and in segments of arms, legs, butt, abs, plus extras) DVD buy Kathy Smith's Lift Weights to Lose Weight 2."
3,Enchanted doll,"Bought this doll after seeing the movie Enchanted. Very cute doll, and a good addition to a Disney collection."
4,Good CD!!,"This girl can sing, but some of the songs are just fillers. A few really show her style, others are just her singing: nothing to stamp the song as ""hers"" any female singer out now could take several of these virtually unheard of songs and make it a hit, that's what Tasha did not do. It's still not a waste of your money, the good songs make it worth it!"
4,Does What It's Supposed To,"No complaints. Ordered it from overseas to be shipped back home to keep my cello up and going and humidified in my absence, and I have not been disappointed. This was a good purchase."
1,"Lasted a couple of years, then wouldn't open",When it locked closed and stopped playing I had to take it apart to retrieve my DVD. Then I trashed it.
2,Leggings,"These leggings are advertised as low-waisted, so I thought ""Good!""-because I have a short torso and long legs. As it turned out, the waist was VERY low-too low. I like to wear a low waist, but these were too much. I had to return them.Otherwise, the service was good, just be wary that the size small is very short in the torso."
5,great product,"Loved this conditioner. Noticeable difference in my curls, especially on the second day after conditioning. Lots of compliments on my hair. It smells good, not heavy and did what it said."
5,TINA COUSINS EXCELENTE,"WONDERFUL LIFE ES EL PRIMER SINGLE EXTRAIDO DE MASTERMIND, EL ULTIMO TRABAJO DE TINA COUSINS SE PRESENTA EN CD MAXI SINGLE CON 2 PARTES EN LAS CUALES SE INCLUYEN REMIXES VARIOS DE LA CANCION PARA DELEITE DE LAS PISTAS DE BAILE SIN FIN Y TAMBIEN UNA BALADA LENTA CASI ACAPELLA QUE TAMBIEN ESTA INCLUIDA EN SU ALBUM MASTERMIND."
1,Ben 10 Alien Force Season One,"It looks like the plan is to introduce Ben 10 Alien Force Season One in three volumes. Volume one is 110 minutes so it probably has 5 episodes. Volume 2 is 88 minutes so it is probably 4 episodes. There were 13 episodes in the Season, so that leaves room for for a Volume 3 with the last 4 episodes. Whatever happened to providing the entire season at once?"
3,serves its purpose,does its job feels kinda cheeply made like if you drop it enough times it will break the string that goes around your neck is pretty short. no major complaints it could be better but for the price its not bad at all.
5,Simple Stopwatch,"I am a teacher and use these stopwatches in elementary school science experiments and recreational/PE activities. I bought a couple to test a year ago and they are still going strong. They are durable (though not waterproof), affordable, and very simple to use. I have had great success with them so I came back and bought 4 more to add to my collection. I have already and would purchase this product again."
4,Good for the price!,"It is great for the price! The only issue I have is that it was a little hard to use at times. Also, it went off a couple times for no reason at all. Otherwise than that, its been fine."
2,"An outline, at best.","I've just taken my real estate exam in Illinois, and I can tell you this book is completely useless with the sole exception of the first couple of chapters.The introductory chapter is good, and the questions to ask a hiring broker are excellent. All that said, that is about all that is good about this book. I'm rating it at 2 stars just because of the first chapters.Mentions scripts for 50 some odd occasions, and none of the scripts are in the book. Wow, what am I supposed to do now? Obviously, this is just a book going on a good title and providing little if any content.Read Danielle Kennedy's books and you will a marked contrast in the types of information you are given here. Now some of the information in Kennedy's books may be a little outlandish, but they are not right-out-wrong, or missing entirely.- Sean"
4,Maybe I'm spoiled by Kresley Cole,"Maybe I'm just spoiled by Kresley Cole, while I loved this story line (which is why I gave it 4 stars) and I will probably end up reading the rest of the series, I just had a hard time buying into the romance. While I was fine with Kian falling in love instantly I found it odd that Loris got over things so quickly (I can't explain it, it just seemed force) Like the author just decided okay now it's time. I was much more into Dyfed's romance. But like I said maybe Kresley Cole has just spoiled me from all other authors"
4,"Buying this one for ""Eyes""","I got a kick out of the movie and am buying this CD especially for the song ""Eyes"" by Rogue Wave. I knew I had heard it somewhere before and it turns out that it seems to be the unofficial theme song of the NBC show Heroes.Besides this soundtrack, I think you can only get this song on an import cd, at least currently."
3,"Only wanted ""Eyes""","I only wanted ""Eyes"" by Rogue Wave, but had to buy the whole album to get it. It sucks when you are forced you to buy the entire album (none of which I like) to get the one song you want. I should probably start investigating other music purchasing sources (is Napster still around?)."
3,"Engaging Heroine, Convoluted Plot","Hellmann's heroine is tough and honest woman. You can't help but like Ellie and her family and friends (her father is grand). However, the plot here is so over the top--Nazis, Chicago politics, etc, etc...that I got a bit lost. The resolution was too neat. The story needed a more steady pace. You can tell it is a first novel. As a native Chicagoan, I did like the the wonderful use of the city. I may read another Ellie Foreman novel to see how Hellmann has grown as a writer."
4,"A great story, excellent sense of place","This well written story has great characters and really brings Chicago alive. There are a couple of major themes, one centers around events that happened right after WWII, the other is contemporary. The dialogue is well done and the characters are sympathetic. My only comment would be that at the end things seemed rushed. I look forward to reading more books by this author."
5,F33PT review,"This thing is great. Used alot, took alot of abuse, and best part is, got it on sale here at amazon for $113. Works well with grip-rite 33 paper collated nails. Good enough to finish a basement with ease ! For the price, it cannot be beat. This thing is $300 at acme tool crib.Amazon rules !"
3,Not what I expected from Poulan,The packaging was less than suitable to withstand UPS; but at least it arrived in one piece. The assembled 3-piece unit is way too heavy in my book. Poulan could lighten things up a bit! The pole pieces fit together too loosely for me - but they are evidently secure enough that they work. The trimmer part works fine (it's angle a little akward compared to my other gas weed-whacker) but the chainsaw unit leaks bar & chain oil all over the place when not in use! I emailed Poulan about the problem a month ago but they have not yet had the courtesy to respond to me. I will not buy another Poulan product!
5,Greatest Hits from a Group of LEGENDS!!!,"I saw The WHO in concert at the Chicago House of Blues, WOW! They were awesome! I went to the music store and picked this CD up and guess what, they are so great that The Who sounded better live!!! This CD has all of their greatest hits. Every music fan must own this album."
5,Island feel,Fantastic cd. Gives you The feeling that your on the beach somewhere under the shade of a palm tree with s cocktail in your hand .
3,The first three tracks are worth buying the CD for,"""Only Time Will Tell"" ties with several others for the best Buffett song of all-time. ""Jamaica Mistaica"" is great, ""Schoolboy Heart"" grows on you. The rest of the CD is pretty average (in my parrothead opinion)."
5,Great Album,"I love ""Banana Wind"". This is my favorite CD. I think that after you have read all of Jimmy's books a lot of the songs on this album make a whole lot more sense and you can really relate. I also love ""Off to see the Lizard"", which seems to be very under rated to me. I find all of his music very calming. Very easy listening and it just takes you away to a better place."
5,a must for anyone who owns a sailboat,excelent book easy to understand and very informative a really good book to own if you own a sailboat or just loves to sail
5,Hanging on my front door,It came quickly and was exactly what was advertised. I am proud to have it hanging on my front door in honor of my son's service to his country.
3,Good safe Mouth CD.,"This is their first CD on a major label, MCA. As such many of the songs are remixes of songs off Word of Mouth and It Means Escape. If you want to get the rough LOUD sound this band is known for your money is better spent on one of the other two. It includes their ""hit"" Jenny says. All their albums do. Maybe they'll leave it off the next one."
1,Bad Customer Service,"Don't be mis-led by ""Usually Ships In 24 Hours"". I ordered this unit by credit card. Took them 6 days to process the order. Then took another 4 days in transit. When I received the unit it was missing the focusing lens rendering it totally useless. Now I have to return it, 4 days transit, wait until they process the return, 6 to 10 days, then another 4 days transit. Hopefully, the replacement will have all the parts to it. If you really need this item, buy it elsewhere."
1,Really Bad Aftertaste!,"Upon tasting this product, I felt a positive reaction, good flavor and texture. But very soon that taste changed to something I can't well describe, almost chemical (though the product is natural), and very unpleasant."
1,Not work,"Hi, my sister choose this gift for my daughter for the birthday 3, but IT did not work and Live in Colombia. I whole do? My daughter Washington disponiendo.Help me."
4,My Kids Love it!!,"Like alot of kids products the software can be tricky to setup, but once it's installed I've had no problems.I have had this toy for about 2 years now and my two youngest (5 and 6 now) will play with it as long as I will let them. Just turn it on and they are creating all kinds of art projects.The tablet is easy and intuitive enough that they can play all by themselves without any adult input. I love to watch them creating and giggling with each other!!Great product!"
1,Fisher-Price should be ashamed of themselves!,"This is, by far, the absolute WORST computer related 'toy' that Fisher-Price has put out. It freezes and crashes my Dell Windows XP machine most of the time, to the point where it is an exercise in total frustration to get this software/hardware to work! To add insult to injury, we also layed out a good amount of money for some of the other titles that go with it, such as 'Barbie Fairytopia'. Why can't Fisher-Price put out a good working product here that isn't defective, such as 'Computer Cool School'?! In any case, my 5 year old and her parents are frustrated and dissapointed, and feel cheated. The many negative reviews here are no coincidence. There should be a class action suit against Fisher-Price for a defective product. SHAME, SHAME, SHAME Fisher-Price for ripping off your customers, many of whom have been loyal to you!"
1,Junk,"I got this for my 5 yr old daughter for Christmas. Tried installing it on her computer, which meets the minimum requirements, but it wouldn't work. Tried installing it on my computer, a very new, bery fast machine. Didn't work there either. No help from Fisher Price, either on-line or by phone. Found comments on-line suggesting Direct X 10, .net framework updates... Nothing works. After reading the other reviews on Amazon, I get the impression that if your computer meets the ""minimum"" requirements, you will either get a toy/computer combination that works, or you won't."
1,Great Idea poor programing....,"My daughter is 4 and we bought this for her for christmas. Our old computer wasn't updated enough to accept the software so it sat for 3 months untill we recently purchased a new HP computer. The software installed fine and not to long. She has been playing it non stop for the last week and i have had to stock up on paper and ink for the printer, but she LOVES IT.. I have, however, had to restart the program mulitple times. usually at least once every time she plays it. It hasn't caused any major problems with my internet connection as others are stating but it is a bit of a hassle to turn it off and turn it back on. [...]. All in all if you like making your kids happy and aren't the type of person to get frustrated over a little hassle then its not bad. Anything for my kids ya know. I am giving a rating of 1 star because the product doesn't work like it should and looking at the other comments im not the only one."
2,Wouldn't work on new computer,"Let me start by saying I was so excited to get this for my daughter for Christmas. It had such a neat concept and she loves art. But we couldn't get it to work. We have a laptop that is only a year old and after numerous phone calls and emails to Fisher Price, we were told our laptop was too outdated for this product. We needed more memory and a new video card and so on. I was so disappointed, as was my daughter. My laptop was not top of the line, but definetly not one of the cheapest either. It basically froze up about every 5 minutes and you had to shut it off and start over."
3,"GREAT, GREAT, GREAT MUSIC",This is what a real diva sounds like. She took risks and broke out on her own terms. The new singers should take notes.
4,Fisheries and the Changing Climate,"Although generic and unspecific, Dr. Glantz brings up a lot of issues about changes that will be required in fishing techniques and gear. This book is easy to read and provocative. Due to the ""uncertainty factor"" regarding changes in ocean circulation patterns, there is much not yet known (even since the publication date), despite scientist's best efforts to do predictive modeling. This book points to areas that will require further research, and is one of the few books written addressing this topic."
4,One of Best Nature DVD's,"This is so unusual. It shows whales almost like they were pets, but they are wild and too big to ever put in an aquarium.Some liked people and seemed to be showing off! There were even several whales who have many calfs and some grandcalves.This is unique and great for all ages."
5,Walter,Got this for my grandson who is Asperger's and is totally fascinated with Humpback Whales. He LOVED it to say the least. I would reccommend this movie to all!!
4,Excelente lectura,Maravilloso paparelismo entre la vida de un hombre y un aconteciemiento histórico como lo es la construcción de una catedral.
4,My piaro kitab,My beloved book! I went to Kathmandu with this and it was a life savior! It is small and therefore limited but easy to manage and with very useful sentences (at the back) and a nice range of word-by-word translation.
1,"Cheap, doesn't work","This product is a joke. It is two pieces of flimsy, bent styrofoam and a cheap plastic cover. It doesn't work at all and is a total waste of money."
1,Not so much...,This was a cheap product and didn't work at all. We purchased this for our basement door and there still was a 2-in gap. I wish they could make this more versatile. I'm glad Amazon offers refunds because we sent it right back. I guess we'll go back to using rolled up towels.
2,such a bother,I guess you get what you pay for.I just wanted an easy draft guard for our back door. Something you can just put under the door and leave there. Well this product comes in 5 pieces and you assemble it..then you must slide the contraption under the the door...now try to close the door.....I am on my hands and knees trying to get the door to close because the foam tube is stuck in the threshold. After manipulating the tube I can finally get the door to close. Don't try to open the door if you have a rug there...it's not happening..must remove rug and if you can't ..look out.
1,doesn't block cold air due to bad design,too wide for the door... doesn't block cold air. I'll try to upload a diagram in the user photos to show what I am talking about.
1,Twin Guard Gyps,I ordered a pair of Twin Guard Draft stoppers.I think that they are overpriced but that's not the worst problem. Instead of sending me 2 units they sent 10. Instead of billing me $19.99 plus shipping I was billed over $80.I let my credit card company know and they removed the charge pending an investigation. What fun!
4,Door Guard,"I was skeptical when I bought the door guard, but it went into place with no fuss and there was a noticeable difference in the temperature in the front hallway. Apparently we were losing more heat under the front door than I had thought. It's good to find a product that performs as advertised."
3,Twin Draft Guard,The product was not exactly what I expected. When I saw it on TV it looked a bit different and I somehow got the impression that the product could be permanently attached to the door. This turned out not to be the case and every time you open the door the product moves and you have to realign it before closing the door. This is rather inconvenient but when the door is closed the product does prevent the draft from coming under the door. Before using the product I could actually feel the cold air coming under the door. Now that I am using the product I can no longer feel the draft.
1,Cheap,I realized that It didn't come assembled and its made out of styrofoam and you cut it to fit your own door. I wish I would have know that I could get it at the nearest Walmart for four bucks cheaper than buying it online. Although I had two glue two pieces to the actual door itself because it kept getting stuck underneath the door when we would try to open it!
2,Poor quality,"I was disappointed in the quality of this product, especially for the price. It consists of two foam tubes that you insert into a lightweight cotton tube, which then is placed beneath your door and supposedly stays put there when you open and close the door. ""Supposedly"" is the operative word here. Plus the light weight does not seem to help keep anything out. Maybe others would have better luck with it."
1,do not buy,"This product does not work. My front door rolled over the foam padding causing the padding to get stuck under the door. I put it on my office door, which is an enclosed porch. It rolls a little smoother, but still does not block cold air."
3,Just okay,"Yes, this product is very flimsy, cheap fabric and cheap foam. Definitely not worth its value. It did help block out some of the draft, but not all...it's just so much easier to install than your regular draft guard. I may go to my local craft store and buy some materials so I can make my own draft guard."
5,works good,I cant believe how fast I got this. I couldnt wait and It really works good. I recommend this product.
2,draft stopper,"catches all sorts of debris, too loose and when shortened, the extra fabric doesn't stay tight."
1,lies!,"The twin draft guard is a total lie that was generated by lying liers. In the television ad, the narrator says, ""without the twin draft guard, money is literally flying out the door"" with an illustration of dollar bills flying under the door. However, I and many of the American population do not have the twin draft guard and dollar bills do NOT fly under their doors. So, in conclusion, twin draft guard ads are an abuse of the naivety of the American people. Lies? I think yes!"
1,Cheap Knock off,"I bought one of these a few years ago and it worked well. I have been meaning to purchase another one and finally saw this and went ahead. This is a cheaper brand, rolled up under the door the minute I put it down and when I put it on other door it pulls up off the floor and lets the air under in one spot. Not happy and I would never buy another one from this company."
1,Draft Guard -- Guard your wallet!,"I purchased a Twin Draft Guard at Staples today and as much as I was looking forward to this product, I am really sad to see it is not well thought out.Have you, yourself took one out of the box and tried to install it??If the foam tubes were a little fatter so they ""filled"" up the cover inside, they might work well.The tubes are small and that leaves a lot of excess bulkiness in the fabric. The draft guard just lies open like a limp puppy once you place it under the door. If the tubes were larger they would snug up the fabric and make it sit tight against your door.I wasted my money on this product..."
1,Twin Draft Guard,This product was a mess and does not work the way it is depicted. I would suggest having a professional come out to install some real weatherstripping down instead of wasting your money on this junk. It's floppy and doesn't even stay under the door right.
2,Not a great value,"Aimee's right. This product looks like it is made of heavy material in the picture, but it's actually two flimsy styrofoam tubes in a nylon case. No way this cost more than $0.85 to make. I have what I would describe as a prototypical normal door and this product reduces the draft only slighlty. Try something a little more expensive if you really need some help reducing draft."
2,Not what I expected,"For the price this item is okay. However, for a concrete floor and a metal door it wasn't sturdy enough. I expected the material to be tougher and the filling to be heavier. Mostly my mistake for not reading thoroughly."
1,Not good enough for normal doors,In the apartment I live the door is just like any other door out there and this guard does not fit tight and does not serve its purpose.
3,Just OK,"It doesn't work quite as well as I anticipated. First it stretches out over time. Second, the door is difficult to close with it on and it pops open once in a while."
4,Draft Guard,"It does the job, but wished they had different colors available and wish it was a little stronger."
1,Draft Guard,"This item is VERY cheaply made, not at all worth the money but I needed something immediately because my Mother who just moved in with me is a smoker in an otherwise smoke-free home and I'm trying to keep the cigarette smoke from seeping out the doors and making my whole house smell like an ashtray."
5,Works fine for me!,"The effectiveness of this product obviously depends upon the unique design/configuration of the door. For my use, it works beautifully."
1,DOES NOT FIT SNUG!!! DONT BUY!!!,The styrofoam that is included isnt big enough to fit snug against the doors. I ended up having to buy more foam for them to fit right. The fabric that it is made from is also very cheap and thin.
3,"not great quality, but does the job.","The draft guard I wanted mostly for noise reduction for which it does a mediocre job. It does protect some of the draft. I was mostly disappointed with the quality of the product, there were loose stings and it was just cheap manufacturing. But it works."
4,Still a challenge for my (almost) 7 yr. old,My daughter loves to exercise. She likes this DVD but still finds it quiet challenging and sweats a lot when she does it. This is the type of exercise video you can do with your child and get a real recent workout.
2,The Ward Cleaver approach to teaching,"If you want the symopsis of this book... here it is in 2 words:Think Positive!If you are unable to do that, then this book is not for you.This book is written as if it were by Ward or June Cleaver. I kept expecting Eddie Haskell to but in and tell me how nice I looked today.Not a bad book. Common sense positive thinking."
5,Foundations - Jeff Hafner's Debut Effort,"A pop-rock-folk album that's worth a listen. 13 Original songs that show a wide range and variety of styles. From rock to jazz to pop to an a capella track to a string quartet, it's a great album for a long car ride or even just to have in the background on a rainy day."
1,The weight of the story...,"Beyond The Time Machine is a sequel to H.G. Wells' The Time Machine. Sad to say, while you can tell a lot of time and energy was put into the story, it has two flaws.The first is the background. Most of the time, when an author creates a world, a setting for his story, maybe 10% of that is used in the story. Like an iceberg much of it is invisible, just under the surface, supporting the characters and plot. Yet, in this novel, it is all in the open, one big data dump. The iceberg is in the foreground, crushing the characters and the slowing the story down.Also, the author loves using his future terms, when he could just continue to use normal English. Techno-babble rules the story - even more so than many Star Trek or Star Wars novels. The result is a book that is almost unreadable.I would suggest you read, instead,The Time ShipsandEpilogue: Time Machine Chronicles."
2,Usually great but sometimes...,Boleros have really nice handle and balance but break pretty easy. The shoulder is so long that the top half of the stick isn't super durable. One of the sticks broke in twenty minutes but the other is still going. I guess buy more of these than you would another kind because you'll definitely need backups.
2,Not a Success,"I bought this toy for my two grandsons (almost 5 and 2 1/2 years), but unlike the other reviews, this has NOT been a success with either one. I particularly don't like the way they stack one dimensionally. In contrast, both boys will play for long periods of time with Wedgits, creating different designs. I ended up buying an extra large set so both little guys could build, balance shapes, and create all kinds of designs."
2,Not interesting enough,"I have a 2 year old and a 4 year old. The older child finds this too dull, and quite frankly there are too few blocks to keep her interested/challenged in the ""game"" aspect of this. The younger kid just uses them as blocks - and, well, you might as well buy regular blocks for that."
4,"If you have 1 to 26, why are you slowing now?","Chances are that you won't be reading this unless you're already a fan of the series, so... Disc 27 contains the usual four episodes. The first two, ""Video-mail of Revenge"" and ""Sakura on my Mind"" are a little disappointing, being flash-back episodes cut from previous episodes. However the other two episodes, ""Scramble! Rescue Lum!"" and ""Death Match: Ataru vs Mendou's Army"" are a two-part story that makes TV27 one of the highpoints of the collection. Lum's UFO malfunctions and crashes on the Mendou estate - Lum is unhurt but suffers amnesia. Mendou sees the opportunity to rewrite the script with himself as Lum's ""Darling"", but Lum can't shake the feeling that there's someone else. Ataru, aided by the ""Gang of Four"" (Megane and co) storms the estate. Lecherous and unfaithful he may be, but as he says: he hates the way Lum tries to pin him down, but someone else taking Lum from him is worse! Much fun, and many explosions."
5,Start a nice family tradition,"The plate arrives in a box with a small card inside that explains the history of the ""special"" red plate in American culture. I'm eager to start using the plate in our new family--I hope to begin a tradition that my children will carry on with their own families. Who doesn't like to feel special now and then? This is a great way to highlight someone and their achievements in a personal setting.I saw this plate elsewhere and turned to Amazon for the best price. Really a good value for something that will be cherished and appreciated for years. Makes me smile just to look at it."
4,Cooperation/collaboration or death,"This is a lot of story packed into less than 100 pages - easy to read but a lot to think about.""Wolf of Shadows"" is different in that it's told from the viewpoint of a very large black wolf called Wolf of Shadows. After a nuclear disaster, Wolf of Shadows and his pack end up integrating two humans - a mother and daughter - into their pack. The story tells of their trials and tribulations as their world heads into nuclear winter and they must survive extreme cold, starvation, and other humans.It is easy to tell when reading the book that Strieber has experience in studying wolves.This was a short but thought-provoking post-apocalyptic read. I recommend it for all ages, young teens on up.Strieber's other P-A book written with James KunetkaWar Day and the Journey Onwardis also an excellent example of the genre."
2,It's tough but...,"I purchased this DVD based on the stellar reviews it received. I tried it once, twice, three times. I just could not get into the bad attitude of Bob and the other exercisers. The workout is tough but everyone's facial expressions, moaning and groaning are just way too distracting to me. The music is not loud enough to be motivating. Seriously, I'm a physician and I've seen women in active labor without pain medications have less of a look on their face of being totally tortured than these exercisers. It almost makes you think they are over-dramtizing. I'm going to try to sell my copy. I'll continue with Jari Love, Jackie Warner, etc. with excellent results and end my workout sessions feeling positive. Those are challenging workouts without the attitude!"
1,Too Repetitious,"This workout DVD goes from being too little for a bigginer for 20 minutes, then to an advanced workout for an hour. I found the advanced work extremely repetitious and have learned more moves with weights from my trainers at the gym. I'm disappointed in this DVD. I would think with the advanced training, Bob Harper would be more creative and use more weight training moves."
4,Good DVD,This is a good solid workout. It is long - 1hour 7 minutes. I usually can't fit it in before work. It is a hard workout for intermediate/advanced people. After this DVD you feel the burn in EVERY muscle (even those you either didn't know you have or haven't used in a long time). I wouldn't suggest this to a beginner (it is too long and hard). This isn't a DVD I do often but I do like it when I have the time to do it. I would suggest his ultimate cardio and body transformation. I like them more.
5,Incredible!!,Incredibly hard but an unbelievable workout!! I just finished the full hour. I was dripping sweat within the first 10 minutes. I am in good shape and found this a very challenging workout. If you like p90x you'll love this because it is as hard as those workouts but works your entire body out instead. Plus Bob has a great and motivating personality. If you're looking for an excellent toning and strength training workout this is your dvd. I want to try his cardio next.
3,Just not for me...,"After using Jillian Michaels' DVDs for awhile, I decided I wanted to change it up a little bit so I read the reviews on Amazon to see which DVD of Bob' was rated well and ended up purchasing PBSS. Although you do work the muscles, which is the whole point, I did not like the full hour workout because the moves feel like they go on forever. Bob is boring in this video, and the faces the professionals make are not appealing. I gave it four tries, but it's just not for me. I like Jillian's No More Trouble Zones a whole lot more, and that DVD keeps my heart rate up higher. I might use the 20 minute workout every now and then, but I was just not impressed. However I like to give second chances, and I just purchased his Yoga for the Warrior so hopefully that will workout better!"
2,"exhuasting, but not in a good way","These workouts felt very old school. They went on forever. The moves felt like weights 101. Tricep kickbacks, rows, squats. I expected more fun and creativity out of Bob."
3,Used to really like Bob! What happened?,"I really used to like Bob, a lot, but then he turned into this ""trying to be hard-ass"" trainer and it just feels fake. You don't have to be mean to people to get them to work out and that is what I loved most about him - that he wasn't mean. This dvd is a good workout but it is very repetitious and I got bored doing the movements a hundred times - it felt like a hundred times. Plus, I injured my upper back the first time I did it and I am not a weakling. I work out regularly and actually just lost 10lbs by consistently doing a variety of dvds at home. Please Bob, go back to your nice, normal self. You do not inspire me to workout in this dvd or your Yoga for the Warrior dvd, like you inspire me when I see you being so supportive and encouraging to the contestants on the Biggest Loser."
5,Great reference,"This is a must have for my quilting/sewing reference library. I am new to rotary cutting, and this book really helped."
5,Very useful but POORLY BOUND,"I find this book to be a very good ""how to"" reference. It's one you should read through after you've been stitching awhile too - to pick up those tidbits you're not doing in your own sewing. Unfortunately, it's bound with stitching and glue (I think) and the paper eventually gets cut through on a page that is left open. I had the book open for a few days on my cutting area - I was doing binding and there is a good explanation of ending it. The binding pages simple fell out - they were ""cut"". Now I will have to see if I can get the book ""drilled"" with 3 holes and put it into a binder. That has never happened to me before, so I can only think that the publisher choose a poor binding method."
5,Ozie Boo,I bought this for my grandchildren and they loved it! I recommend it if you small children..Great kid movie.........
1,LIARS,"DO NOT ORDER FROM BUNCHES OF BOOKS!!!!!!!They are a bunch of liars and send horrible quality books. I was unhappy by a purchase I received from them. When I wrote a bad review, a representative from the company sent me an email BEGGING me to tell them why I was unsatifyed. They promised 20% back of what I payed and they wanted me to delete my negative review. I didn't respond at first and by the next day I had another concerning email. I figured they were sorry and would keep their promis so I deleted the comment and wrote back. And now, 2 weeks later, no response and no 20% back. I'm disappointed and I'm warning everyone DONT BUY FROM THEM"
1,Judge this book by its cover,"Imagine a book sold to foreigners called ""What You Need to Know About America & Americans"" and on the cover it had a cowboy, a church, a playstation, a flag, a mcdonalds and an F15.Your kneejerk reaction might be to think a few facts were omitted, particularly if the book was a scant 180 pages. You might think that there is a more complex history and culture than just the cowboy on the cover, right? You might be offended that someone wrapped up your country and put a big inaccurate label on it.Same thing here.My father spent summers with Cairo University's National Cancer Institute and being a bored foreigner I found myself hanging out with the locals. I learned a lot more about the people behind the ""bad word"" that has become Islam in recent years.Engage these people in conversation and you'll find you have more in common than you have different. Lastly, if you decide to buy this book, don't do yourself a disservice by making this the only one."
1,Thought I was in Heaven Until the honeymoon was Over!!!,Basicly the motherboards in Hp laptops are not a good product. I have had 2 motherboards in my hp dv1310us laptop go *poof* on me and all hp corp. office does is laugh at me .
3,Kayden's Christmas,The toy seems educational and interactive which is what I was wanting to give our 4yr old granddaughter but I didn't realize how much time was involved with teaching her how to use it. It's a game for both child and parent so be ready to spend time with your little one in order for them to be able to play with it.
3,can i be the only one.....,"i thought this book was funny as a kid, and i do mean a kid...about 4 or 5 years of age when i liked this book, thought it was silly, fun, even funny, and as a kid i thought hating everything was sorta grown-up. does that any sence- prob. not...any way i hid this book from my mom whom i stole it from and found it, again, one day while cleaning my room after getting back from 4 yrs of college...oh my god this book is dumb and i cant do anything with it!!! the dusk is caked on it and i'm sure it wouldnt do for a coaster...i was happy to see reviews for this book - but then it was the illustrater--by the way the pictures you draw are scary- and thats not cool slang--im very weired out by many pictures--why is the person backing away from hitting pac man with the axe-doesnt make scence--oh well i must be the only one. dumb book..but i liked it as a child so it cant be too bad--3 stars--dont ask me why."
5,Simply perfect!,"i love it! this is exactly what i need. simple and portable and a 10/10 audio quality. I recommend this product if you want a portable iPod speaker, this iHome is what you need!"
3,Can't change time,"I really want this to work, but after multiple attempts to set clock, I have given up and just unplugged it. If anyone has any insight I would appreciate it."
3,Good for the cost,"I received this as a present, so I can't complain too much about the price. I like it because of it's portability, but it would be nice if the plug had foldable prongs so it would fit better with the included carrying bag. It came with molds for the various Apple products, but like many, most of my iProducts have cases and so I elected to not use the molds.The sound is sufficient for the size and price. I wasn't expecting superior quality. The alarm buzzer is very inadequate, so it's best to set a list of your loudest rock or classical symphony and turn the volume on. Overall, it's a good product for the price."
1,Alarm Function a Deal Breaker,"I can't imagine what they were thinking when they designed this thing.Here's the problem. If you have an ipod in the unit you cannot wake up to the buzzer, only the ipod. If you go to sleep with the ipod on, playing some mellow music at low volume, this is what you will hear for your morning alarm. It's not going to wake you. You cannot use the buzzer for an alarm unless you take the ipod out. What's the point of having it?Mine is going back."
2,Very Disappointing,I bought this a couple of years ago when it was $99. The manual is awkwardly arranged and I've had a hard time setting the clock and alarm. Nor did it come with a remote. The sound is OK. It's a little large to be easily portable.
2,Crusoe - Aidan Quinn and Adé Sapara,Unfortuntely we are unable to view this product as the tape does not run to speed. Audio is very slow and there is no picture.
4,It's Different,I bought the CD for my wife. She loved it! I was very pleased the the pricing and shipping of the product. I'm a more traditional Christmas song person my self.
1,Jimmy Buffett bomb,This is NOT a good example of Jimmy Buffett and the music is below his usual fun albums. I do not recommend this album!
2,"Be careful, some packages were moldy.","Two stars because I've had this product before from the store and it is fantastic and very healthy. However when I thought I was getting a great deal from Amazon, it turns out that when it arrived, half of the bags were moldy! However, Amazon was great about it and refunded my money. Perhaps the lack of preservatives give them a very low shelf life, so if it's low in sodium, consider buying from a local store when you can check the package and dates before buying."
5,the best,"i think that this record is the best because i like new edition they have good things about them like booby is the nice but on the edge person,and ronnie is like the easy one,ricky like he out goin person,biv has a lot going on,ralph tresvant is the most sweet person i have met in personand johinny gill he lift you when down when you listen to hs muic."
1,Kodak does not reimburse,"I bought the Kodak EastShare in May. It didn't work. I sent it to Kodak for repair as they would not reimburse me. Their response was that it was unrepairable so they sent me another one. I had the same problem after a few uses - lens opens when it wants - pictures sometimes are good, sometimes not good. It's not my printer as I tried two other cameras and their pics came out perfect. Kodak still would not give me a refund. I was advised that they would continue to fix or replace it while it was in warranty. My question to them was &quot;what about after the warranty is over?&quot; - then it's my problem - Don't buy this camera - you may be lucky and get a good one, but you may end up like me."
1,10 Step process for disposal,"Hopefully people will read this, and heed the warning. At the following link what you will see is a person's foot, which was injured severely when he accidentely stepped on a couple of pieces of broken glass from one of these globes.The globes as well as other energy saving bulbs contain Mercury, and there is a list of ten steps in the disposal and clean-up should one break. When you see what happened from those who were 'not' aware of the Mercury, it will make you think twice about the energy savers.[...]"
4,A very broad treatment of AI Fundamentals,Tanimoto provides a very broad treatment of AI techniques. As such dicussions are often brief. There is an outstanding section on Computer vision. Knowledge representation is also well covered. The author presents highly idiomatic examples of Lisp code. This book would be ideal for anyone not familiar with AI techniques who wants to do AI research and/or development.
4,Mostly Extras,"The program is quite good... but only fills up half of the three DVD's, and runs less than two hours. The rest are interviews with the various experts. Although the interviews are well done, most of the ""5 hour documentary"" are really just these extras."
1,Lacks original content and repetitive as other doc,"It contains same material as other documentaris on Atlantis with different cover.. Lacks originality too much talking from the same people and no maps, not enouph pictures......"
2,The packaging of the DVD really sucks,"The folks at Milestone seriously need to rethink their packaging designs. Killer of Sheep is an excellent film, it's just unfortunate that it didn't get the DVD treatment that it deserves. The discs are stuffed in a wafer thin piece of cardboard. Are economics that big of an issue that Milestone can't afford to put the DVD's in a real case. The extras are a little on the weak side, too. It's nice to have My Brother's Wedding as a bonus but, I would like to know a little more about Killer of Sheep. The Criterion Collection needs to get a hold of this one, hopefully it's not to late."
2,Interesting Movie,"The acting wasn't anywhere near fabulous, ok, it was horrible. Certain scenes drag on way too long. There seem to be many technical glitches, such as in one scene they zoom in on people sitting in the living room, and when they zoom out they're in the kitchen. In a car scene if you look at the windows all you see is white...The only reason why I give this movie two stars is that it is very amusing to laugh at, and it has positive moral values."
2,BUSEY GOES TO THE DOGS,"Yes, the Pomeranian is cute, and yes the movie's moral message is a sound one. But do we really need another movie about someone returning to earth to make up for what they did before they died? And we've had them return in dogs before. But this movie is painfully bad in many ways: Gary Busey gives probably the worst performance of his checkered career; the plotline is so shallow, and the characters so cliche, it's sad; the physical pratfalls of the angel (Oz Perkins) and the two security guards are horribly staged; and Christopher Atkns' family is so perfect, it's laughable. They are supposed to be financially strapped but they have a big big house; an expensive SUV. While it is a film the family can watch together, I'm not sure there's enough going on to really keep the kids interested."
1,Very basic gloves --not for winter/snow!,These gloves can hardly be much thinner and aren't suitable for winter/snow or when the temperature is cold (contrary to the ad).
2,pre nursing reviews in arithmetic,the book is not very informative. You can't check your math for a lot of the problems.
3,Informative,I found this book to be very informative. I recommend it to someone who needs to brush up on their basic skills.
5,Excellent Service,Product arrived sooner than expected and was in excellent condition. Would purchase from this seller in the future.
2,Poor quality lids...,"I purchased this box for its simplicity, but the lid hinges are flimsy and break easily...definitely not worth the time or money."
2,Disappointing,"I only had this pill dispenser for a couple months before I dropped it and broke off one of the day tabs. It still snaps on, but the fact of the matter is that it broke with one drop. It wasn't a very high drop either, maybe three feet onto carpet. I guess you get what you pay for.Beyond the flimsy construction, it's nice to have a months worth of medication ready to go. The tabs are clearly labeled with the days of the month, but the text is not as large as it could be. If you're half blind or a zombie in the morning, I wouldn't get this product.There are lots of pill boxes made to hold a months worth of medication, so keep looking."
2,pill despenser- one month,"I dont like this item because it breaks very easy, I order 6 of them to give as gift, and at least half of them break the same day that start being used"
1,A piece of junk.,"Really bad quality! The lid isn't properly attached - it snaps into place, and snaps out just as easily, sending your whole month's worth of pills all over the floor. I had to use scotch tape to secure the ends of the lid to the box to stop it falling off. Then the individual covers for each day are very fragile -- expect the first one to break within a day or two, followed by many more over the next week or two until you throw the useless contraption out. This is a piece of absolute junk -- just cheap molded plastic that probably costs 3 or 4 cents to make back in China."
1,the worst,If there was a half star I would of marked that one.2 lids snaped off the first day. Could not use it from then on.
1,piece of junk,"When I unwrapped it, two of the little compartment flaps had already been broken off. Not a good sign for something that is going to have to be opened and closed hundreds of times. I sent it back. Is there less than a one star rating?"
2,"Not like the old ones, but...","I have had a set of Ekco measuring cups for years and when the one-cup size broke, I ordered another set. These new ones are not nearly as substantial. They are of much lighter gauge steel, not as polished. The handle of the one-cup size bent very easily when I dipped something with it. I had done the same thing with the old one for 20 years and it never bent. Beware of ""new and improved..."""
5,good,"simply high quality hangers- had no complaints with either delivery or product, highly recommne dthese hangers- thats all i have to say"
4,"Great for allowing clothes to defy gravity, not so great for a boomerang.","I was looking for something that could hold my clothes and be entertaining to throw. It's all aces in one aspect, floaters in another. It definitely gives a big middle finger to the floor and gravity, and is great for reflecting light to disorientate the occasional closet ninja.But if you have an item (food/gems/hearts) just across the room that you are far to uninterested in getting up to go get it but need that item and you are enthused enough to throw an shiny triangle at it, it will not return the item. No instead it has this strange ability to make a clang noise and turn objects into slightly bruised or broken version of itself.So I recommend it for holding the occasional heavy clothing (winter coat, leather jacket, lava suit) from touching the ground, but not good as an object of item returning."
1,DO NOT BUY!!! MAJOR DESIGN FLAW!!,"Plain and simple, this product is garbage. The metal is only about twice as thick as a wire hanger from the cleaners. But UNLIKE those hangers, this hanger is NOT ONE PEICE. The hook on top is glued to the rest of the hanger. It doesn't take much pressure at all to SNAP THE HOOK CLEAN OFF, and it cannot be repaired. I did it to 3 of them by accident while opening the package. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!"
1,"Great content, lazy re-format","I am really disappointed with this DVD. I ordered it because it is one of my favorite comedy routines. However, I specifically wanted the DVD because the VHS is not closed captioned, and my husband is deaf. Because he requires captions/subtitles, he has never gotten to see what is (in my opinion) one of the best stand up routines ever performed.Much to my disappointment after receiving this DVD, it is not subtitled and has no captions. What is the point? What year are we living in? Is it really that hard, after going through all of the trouble of putting an older film on DVD to subtitle or caption it?Very disappointing."
3,Where's this Eddie now???,"I see these comedy concerts from this one to RAW which I think is lightyears funnier and I wonder, how did This eddie of these movies, become the Eddie in ""Dr. Dolittle"".This is a must see for people who forgot that he could say things funny that didn't slip out of a CG Donkey. Give it a try."
5,HILARIOUSLY DELERIOUS,I've been searching for this DVD for years. PLEASE bring the best stand up ever to Amazon. I promise the world will be a better place if you do.
5,The best after Richard Pryor,"This is Eddie Murphy's best standup performance ever. I had to get this for my collection, just as I have all of Richard Pryors work. Easy 5 star rating."
5,The best stand up I ever seen.,The first time I seen this I was about 7 and I couldn't believe the stuff he was saying. But I watched Delirious about fifty times since then and it's still the funniest stand up comedy to me.
5,To those stupid enouth to pay this much for the video,"If you are looking for this video, I would suggest you DO NOT BUY IT THROUGH AMAZON!!! The tape is normally $69 at a video store. I also saw a used copy once here @ Amazon for $16.95Even though this is a great concert, I think you would be the absolute stupidest person in the world if you are going to waste your money buying anything from Amazon unless you do some research first!Buyer Beware --- Take a moment and think about it before you lose your common sense... el fin"
3,"A little of this, a bit of that","I've read all of John Irving's novels, but somehow let this book get by. Having just finished it (soon after reading A Widow For One Year), I have mixed feelings. I would love to read Irving's memoirs, but I'm more interested in his family life than all that wrestling business. One can't help imagine that there is a lot of John Irving in T.S. Garp and Johnny Wheelwright and John Berry, but Irving does not reveal this. The short stories and his comments on them are well worth it, though. When he calls one story amateurish to the point of embarrassment, I can't help but think ""I only wish I could write one story as well as Irving's worst."" For fans of the Irving mystique it's a must read, but for others I'd say go straight to The Pension Grillparzer."
3,Lard First,"The first album by this legendary--though little known--French avant/jazz/electronic group. Definitely leans more toward the jazz/fusion spectrum on this album, as opposed to their second and third albums. Raw and primitive at times, though shot through with a searing energy, it's a worthwhile addition to any Francophile's record collection."
3,Cute Game,"This is a cute game for young children. You get a horse and then have to take care of it. It can get boring and is very similiar to Catz, Dogz and Hamsterz. My daughter enjoys playing it."
3,Info pros only,"I gave this book a three-star but it is really a book I would like to give two different ratings to. Since that is not possible I have compromised. I split it down the middle.If you are not already in the business of researching in some fashion this is a one-star book. You have to have some background to build on, in particular when it comes to finding clients. If you are like me and just enjoy research and thought this a way to start a home based business, you will be sorely disappointed.However, if you are someone with a research background this is the blueprint for how it is done by someone who wants to branch out on their own. It is that simple. Five-star must have book for the info pro with entrepreneurial inclinations."
2,"Many Pages, Minimal Useful Content","There are a variety of approaches to starting a Research Business, and this book simply does little justice to providing business-smart content for doing just that. If you want to embark into a research business on your own, this might give you a vision but it will certainly not give you the business smarts you need to really start and manage your new business. Best to look into resources on starting a consulting business and other resources about starting any business.Best of luck.- Dissapointed"
3,It was okay,"but didn't grab me and keep my attention. I did finish it, and I really didn't feel cheated that I had purchased it, but it just wasn't anything I would necessarily pass along to someone else."
3,Great idea but doesn't quite get it somehow....,"....it took me some pages to decide whether I liked this or not. I did like it but did not love it as I had hoped. I am always attracted to religious ""thrillers,"" but somehow this didn't get there. It was just o.k. I want something deeper somehow, a main character who is deeply invested in the setting and subject matter of the story. Cotten Stone, to me, is an almost-forgettable character. Worth reading for light entertainment, but not meaty enough for me."
5,A spectacular page turner!,"Grail Conspiracy is a fast paced story that leads any reader who is intrigued by conspiracy into a web of religous theories and mystery. This books is filled with great detail regarding religion, science and philosophy, but not to a level that overwhelms the reader. It is a captivating story with characters who win your heart."
2,The Grail Conspiracy,"I was drawn to 'The Grail Conspiracy' by author Nancy J. Cohen's quote on its back cover: ""If you liked 'The Da Vinci Code,' run out and buy this book."" I was disappointed. It's fairly well written, has good character development, and the scientific and religious elements are well-researched, but the ""supernatural"" segments of the story are not acceptable to me. In my opinion, the writing of Lynn Sholes and Joe Moore cannot compare with that of Dan Brown in 'The Da Vinci Code.'"
2,"NOT ""the Da Vinci Code""",This started with interesting characters and action -but the quality of writing was fair and the story went downhill. Would not recommend even as a beach book.
2,"Cute, alarmist, simplistic","Cute book, especially the title, but it suffers from a superficial examination of issues related to our right to bear arms. In short, an uncritical embracing of NRA pamphlet sound bites. Moreover, a sketchy summary of gun care.I have two recommendations: The Seven Myths of Gun Control by Poe and any of the Gun Digest volumes specific for the care of your firearms."
5,A combination of basic primer and heartfelt oratory,"Handguns And Freedom by Joe Pierre is both a practical guide to selecting a handgun for self-defense (and using it responsibly), and a sharply announced wake-up-call arguing persuasively for the importance of preserving the second amendment and taking a stand against overzealous gun control efforts. An astutely written and passionate combination of basic primer and heartfelt oratory, Handguns And Freedom is very highly recommended reading for all gun owners and gun policy advocates."
2,This Book Was Published in 2002....,"...and there's not a single word about Glocks, SIGs or H&Ks.;C'mon!!! There's more to handguns than revolvers and Colt 1911s, but you'd never know it from this book."
5,Specialty cutting tools,The tools do fit the machine they are designed for. they are sharp. In general I am pleased with the product and its delivery.
3,Hugh Foster,"The strength of this book lies in the quality of the writing. Mr. Israel is a very good writer, and has produced an easy-to-read, gripping text. It is a ""one-sitting"" book, for it is almost impossible to put down once started. There is an area of major weakness, however: factuality. There is virtually no atrribution for any detail or claim made by the book, and no way to identify most of the characters. There are no footnotes, endnotes, chapter notes, or any other citation of the sources of the information provided. Accordingly, this book cannot be accepted as history, despite the quality of the writing."
3,Don't Order These...Shipping is way too high.,This product wound up costing me more than twice what I can buy them at Wal-Mart. Don't order them by mail.
3,Note imperfections,"Paragraphs underlined. Many, many many indications and chicken scratch around the page borders. Many pages with blackened smudges, some with only 60% of the words readable. Looks like a well used students book that was retrieved from the trash then copied. The three stars are because I haven't read this book yet. Not worth the $24.P.S.-- after some reading this is an interesting book and worth getting if you absolutely need another book on the subject. Criticisms above still apply but the book is a good read."

1,*Unsafe for Jeep Grand Cherokee*,I am a professional mechanic. Installed these on a 1997 Grand Cherokee. Had 1/2 play brand new out of box. Didn't even make it out the door. Buyer Beware!!!
4,This Nonet Swings!,"Why a nonet? Because this combination of nine players gives the driving swing of a big band with the improvizational flexibility of a small group. All the musicians on this recording are superb. Personnel include Jim Cifelli as leader, composer trumpeter and flugelhornist; Andy Gravish, trumpet and flugelhorn; Cliff Lyons, alto and soprano sax; Barbara Cifelli, bari sax, C and alto flute and bass clarinet; Joel Frahm, tenor sax; Pete McCann, guitar; Mary Ann McSweeney, bass; and Tim Horner, drums.Most of the eight selections are Jim Cifelli compositions with the exception of Fe Fi Fo Fum/Epeak No Evil and Cole Porter's What Is this Thing Called Love?If you like tight, swinging arrangements and soaring trumpets, this album is for you. I was particularly impressed with the baritone saxophone work of Barbara Cifelli, Peter McCann's tasteful guitar and the string bass work of Mary Ann McSweeney."
5,Walk along together........,"We've all been there and this album says it all. Melissa Etheridge takes us along for the ride on her journey of self-discovery and healing. From the first track ""Lover Please"" to the last, ""Heal Me"" we can witness the evolution of mind, heart and spirit. With style reminiscent of her ealier works, Melissa Etheridge cranks out tunes ranging from rock to blues to folk styles. It's almost impossible to walk away with anything but a positive attitude after listening to this album and even more impossible not to sing along with as much emotion as Melissa Etheridge pours into the lyrics. The album starts out broken hearted and ends up with a grand self-awareness and affirmation of the human spirit and survival. A must have for any Melissa Etheridge fan and possibly a great introductory album for those unfamiliar with her works."
5,What happened to Melissa?,"Everytime I buy her new CD, she gets better and better. Man! this girl jams and I'm hooked to her skin! You got to have this CD if you don't already. See melissaetheridge.com for her concert info and catch a show if you can. SHe is back and better than ever!"
5,Skin Deep,This CD is an absolute must. It is such and amazing album with very emotionally raw material. Melissa Etheridge is an incredible musician and strong song writer. I rave about this CD to all of my friends and tell them that it is a must have for their music collection. The depth of her emotions comes through on this album. Buy it!!!!!!!
4,interesting,this cd is very different from all the rest. tho its mostly about her break up with her wife. it sounds like she put a lot of emotion into it. i would recomend you get this.
4,"Great sound, a bit uncomfortable to wear","I wanted good sounding headphones but didn't want to spend a lot of money given my hearing has been affected by too many hours behind piston aircraft engines in my younger years. To get a better opinion, I gave them to a relative in audio recording and after listening to them, he said he would have no problem using them in the studio, so I guess they don't sound bad:-) They are ""open"" headphones which means that other people can hear whatever you are listening to, so these would not be good to use in cubeville.The only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 is they can get a bit uncomfortable after wearing for over an hour or so."
4,Great cans,I like the fact that when I use these cans I can still hear thing in the room around me. Sound is awsome.The are well made and American. Will buy this brand again in the furture when I need another set.
4,Grado SR60 Headphones,"The head phones are very good. Frankly, I have difficulty discerning any significant difference between the SR60 and the much more expensive SR325 Grado Headphones which sell for around $300. I own both."
3,uncomfortable,"I've used these headphones for about a year now. It's true that they sound very good at this price point. However, these are very uncomfortable for extended use. Because the pads press on your ears, your cartilage is squished. My ears hurt after about an hour of use. I don't recommend these cans."
3,"good sound, but...","I'm not an audiophile, but I did think the sound quality of the headphones was very good in comparison to other headphones in this price/quality range. My only problem was comfort. My ears were uncomfortable (and quite warm) after a short time wearing them. Other reviewers mentioned this aspect, but I hoped it was because they had larger heads! I had previously returned another set of Grado headphones for the same issue--very good sound, but very tight."
1,Not my cup of tea,"I had a high expectation for these headphones as I had seen so many good review, but SR60i didn't seem to work for me. The sound signature is VERY different from the headphones I currently have (Sennheiser HD580, Koss KSC75 and Creative Aurvana Live!). There's too much emphasis on the lower treble, and the bass is too weak. And the vocals(male and female alike) all sounded like they are coming throug a PVC pipe. Very strange coloration. And I think this is somewhat related to the reflection from the plastic housing behind the driver. This type of coloration becomes more obvious when you watch movies with them as the conversations in the movie sound like they are coming from very old (50+ years old) recordings. Overall, these headphones didn't work for me and had to return them, but I'm quite sure there are many people who are perfectly happy with them. So the best way to avoid the hassle of returning them is to audition them before you buy."
5,awesome headphones and a great value,"I looked at several different models of headphones before purchasing these and I'm very pleased. excellent value for the money, If your looking for a set of headphones that look great and sound great but don't have $300-$600 bucks then don't hesitate to purchase."
5,Pimp my phones...,"Acoustic and aesthetic mods are quite common with these great cans, worthy of 5 stars before you pimp them :)The cans can be removed from the band, and the band replaced, the pads on the sr60 (comfies) can be exchanged for bowls, like the SR80s... changing comfort, and a basshead mod involves taping the outside of those bowls to make much more pronounced bass possible... and lots more.So your great sounding phones can be customized to be even better sounding phones. Google Grado mods."
2,Not So Good !!,"Bought these headphones and ended up returning them after a week. Took a $15.00 loss on the return. The large open air pads made my ears get hot and uncomfortabe. And the sound lacked any bass. Read a lot of good reviews, but I dissagree. Bought a cheap pair Koss that sound great. Gave it 2 stars because the headset was good quality. Not so good sound."
5,Great value,"For the money, these headphones are hard to beat.Very detailed, but not harsh.Comfortable to wear for extended periods."
5,"Frank assessment of a brilliant, yet flawed man.....","Terry Teachout's new book about H.L. Mencken is a revelation, largely because it is no mere hagiography; nor does it attempt to smear Mencken as a one-dimensional bigot. Instead, Teachout admits that while yes, Mencken was anti-Semetic, often petty, and sometimes out of touch (especially from about 1935 on), he was also a brilliant writer, master critic, and unparalleled wit in the Mark Twain tradition. Teachout provides a nice balance of the personal and the public man (using previously unpublished letters and journal entries) so that it is often the case that Mencken's own words indict him (rather than the P.C. crowd taking things out of context). What we are left with is a man still worthy of admiration (at the very least, for a journalistic style that is unrivaled), but one who deserves to be further scrutinized for his contradictions. Bravo, Teachout, for giving us a living, breathing Mencken rather than a caricature."
4,iPod speaker,"I wish it would let me plug in 2 balanced speakers on the sides, but it works fine as a centralized unit. I love that it recharges the iPod and is portable. great."
4,I actually like this speaker!,"I bought this for myself (from TJ Maxx, actually...) and It's actually pretty good! I wanted something that had good sound, that was loud enough to fill a good size room (20' x 20') and portable. I didn't need a clock. I paid a lot more at TJ (59.99), but the sound is pretty hearty, plenty of bass and treble, goes loud without distortion, and also goes very very quiet (good for baby's room). I have the 80g ipod classic."
4,great sound for small unit,I love this stereo. If you like surround sound this is not the item for you. It works well for a bedroom or a studio. The remote is small and you can adjust the treble and bass very easily so it sounds the way you like it. The nice thing is you can use it with any size ipod. This is a Great purchase for $30.
4,Spent $20 on it,"First of all, I spent $20 on this unit with free shipping through Prime. For that price I love it. I keep it in the bathroom to listen while I shower and get ready.-The remote is nice and it sounds good in a small room.-The bass is shallowThe unit is def worth $20 but I wouldn't pay any more for it, especially if you need something as your primary sound system. The 4 stars I have given most certainly reflect the price I paid. At $40+, I would give it 2 or 3 stars."
2,Doesn't really work with 3rd Gen iPod,"I bought this for use with a 3rd Gen 20GB iPod. It is a docking iPod, with a touch wheel and buttons. If I put the iPod into the speaker when it's already playing, sound will come out. But, the iPod isn't charging. And, the screen freezes after about a minute of play. The music continues to play, but I can't use the remote or change songs. I've contacted the manufacturer's tech support and will change this review if they can tell me how to make it work. I just wanted to warn people."
4,Outstanding...for an Amazon Gold Box Deal,"Sound is better than I expected, but then, I bought this when it was a Gold Box deal at $19.99. Considering the outrageous prices attached to most iPod accessories (this one at regular price is no exception, even on the company's website), I would not have purchased it even at the Amazon regularly ""discounted"" price. I've not tried hooking it up to a computer or anything else other than my 4GB iPod nano (it has an outlet for a microphone for the karoke minded). My gripe, after three hours of use, is the remote control. Small and slender, using a flat CR type battery, it causes the controls on the speaker to all flash when it is used. It can cause the iPod to hesitate when trying to move through the menu. The seperate bass and treble controls do not seem to make much difference in the sound which is not at all bad as it is.Major kudos to Amazon for their Amazon Prime shipping and their Gold Box deals!"
1,Dock my Nano? It won't play!,"I can't get this thing to work with my 2nd Gen. Nano in the docking system. It plays when I use the little wire and plug my Nano into the back of the speaker. I have done the trouble shooting techniques, yet it still does not play with the Nano in the docking station. This is quite frustrating."
3,Good for $19.99,I bought this directly from Amazon as a Gold Box special. Like others have mentioned the sound is not that great (monaural). This is good @ the twenty bucks I spent but no more. Also one little stupid design flaw; if no signal is being sent to the unit it shuts off regardless if it's running on batteries or if it's plugged in. I verified this with the manufacturer. I use this as a computer speaker as well as with my ipod and it's dumb to have to turn it on each time I want to listen to a video clip or something.
5,Should be in every Christian's library,"Arminians believe salvation is all man, Calvinists believe salvation is all God. The truth falls somewhere in between. Olson provides solid biblical arguments for this mediate view. This view, while recognizing God's sovereignty, allows for man's free will. Olson demonstrates that one is not exclusive of the other, that man's free will in no way limits God's sovereignty; in fact, God created man's free will -- it was part of His original plan for man to be able to choose to love Him.I highly recommend Olson's book -- it should be in every Christian's library."
3,Dissappointing Theology Book,"I bought this book at a local Christian bookstore and was hopeful that this would be a book that bridges the common themes of Arminians and Calvinist. However, I was dissappointed and took the book back for a refund.My main problem with the book is while Olson does give both sides of the issues he often chooses the Calvinist side. I don't mind that too much but he tends to choose the dispensational views of grace held by Chafer, Ryrie, and Zane Hodges. For example, in his chapter on salvation Olson dives into the Lordship issue of salvation. However, he quickly chooses the anti-Lordship view and then tries to offer biblical justification for doing so. Obviously, he fails at it.Rather than mediating between the two views, Olson should have just written a systematic theology book on his own and not try to get both camps to buy his book.I would recommend Wayne Grudem's SYSTEMATIC THEOLOGY or Stanley Horton's SYSTEMATIC THEOLOGY over this work. Save your money and your time."
3,e,"This is not hot pink like in the picture. This is baby pink. I hate baby pink and would never have bought this if I knew it was that color. If you like that color, thank this is fine."
5,My Mom's little red wagon!,I bought this for my Mom. She is 75 and it is a lot of work for her to bring packages from the car to the house. She takes the wagon to the car and loads it up and brings it to the back door! The big tires make it easier to go over things...such as the snow New England has been blessed with this year. She loves it!
3,Pretty decent,"I bought this because I was desperate and there weren't a lot of choices for this type of thing. I had seen a review that warned that the balls that hold each handle in place can get stuck. Sure enough, it happened to me. One of the balls is stuck open so that a broom handle can't be hung in that spot. If that wasn't a recurring issue, this would be a great an convenient product."
3,Nice but not so nice,"Rated as a three because the product arrived on time just after Christmas, however it was broken which was a big dissappointment. The holder had a big split or a long crack extending from the side corner right across one of the entry holes at one end so only four holes can be used.I notice now that one of the bulbs that holds the handle of the item, now slips from time to time. It cannot handle the weight of a mop as before as it slips. So I attach only smaller light things eg., a plastic handle gardening trowel as against a mop or broom.Despite this, it is a neat way of storing stuff"
4,Magic Holder,"easy to fix to wall & does what it says, tidy""s away items & makes them easy to move & replace"
1,Does not work,"Great idea. However, the ""balls"" that are supposed to hold things in place can get stuckinside and then don't work. This happened to one just as I got it on the wall and startedto put things in place. Can not get the ""ball"" back out so it will work. Since then many others have donethe same thing rendering the whole thing pretty useless. Would not buy again. Got an OXOholder at the same time and while it only has four places for things it has worked flawlesslyand I will be ordering more of those to take the place of this product."
4,"Very useful, but...","I really like this item. Nice to get all my brooms, mops, etc. off the floor that were falling down constantly. The problem is only 4 out of 5 slots work! Not worth taking off the wall and sending back. Glad 4 is enough. Otherwise I would give 5 stars."
5,SOOO glad we got this,"Works like a charm and was also easy to hang. Now all our brooms, mops, swifters are neatly off the floor and in some sort of order. Totally worth every penny for smart and helpful items such as this!!!"
2,Not nearly as good as said.,"3 words. This game sux. Not nearly as good as the advances or super smash brothers. Do not buy. Sux, Sux,Sux!"
5,This Man Can WRITE,"I have now purchased my fourth copy of Napoleon's Glands because the first three copies were loaned to friends who refused to part with them. As a teacher of writing, I often read excerpts of Napolean's Glands and other of Karlen's works to dazzle my students with how good writing should be done. My oral reading to my classes of Karlen's writing is always followed by a mass-gasp of awe, oh-wow, and then silence as the beauty of his words sink in. Arno Karlen has ""IT."" Don't miss his books."
3,Is It real - - or?,"I'm not sure. This was such a wonderful surprise. I was happy that I could get this ink cartridge at this price instead of the epson ink cartridge. I'm not sure- but,I think it doesn't print as many pages, or maybe it doesn't work as well with my computer because it isn't a epson ink cartridge. I bought two cartridges and had to use both because my computer started to act as though the ink cartridge was empty. So I ended up using both ink cartridges within weeks. Is this normal?"
2,"Boring, limited, and uninformative","It's not that the book is unfunny. It's uninformative. You will never learn how to write jokes or comedy films, reading this book. If you want to learn the craft, look forThe Comic Toolbox: How to Be Funny Even If You're NotandThe New Comedy Writing Step by Step. The latter is mainly for stand-up comedy, but still helpful."
2,This isn't worth the money,"I love nsync, true. i am a huge fan, but this is just a story told by a Bristish woman. I bought it expecting the NSYNCers to be saying SOMETHING but they say NOTHING!! Trust me, save your pennies for a cd where NSYNC has thier say in the cd."
4,Heavy Reading- Very Enjoyable,"Chapter 1 says it all- ""Why this book"" a well laid out discussion of the conflicing ideas surrounding evolution of infectious diseases. Not alot of fun narrative about the hunt for these diseases or the personal stories behind the science, but if you read this book then you will be able to better appreciate the popular novels about virlolgy and emerging diseases etc."
2,Book is Hard To Read,"The writing here is for the most part good, but the type point is so small the book is hard to read. I looked at some other Chernow books and the point is larger. I honestly have to strain to read the book. Perhaps the publisher chose this smaller type for cost reasons since the book is so large, but it is really a disservice to readers to have to wade through. The book has so many details that they get in the way of the story. This is flaw that is hard to overcome and it too is a real negative for the book."
2,So so book,Bought this book for my husband . The book is a long one. Had some interesting insights into the man. He was very disappointed in the way the author end the last chapters.
5,Fascinating historical reading,Anyone interested in U. S. history will enjoy reading this fascinating biography of Alexander Hamilton. don't miss it!
5,Rocket man,"Chernow's book has a faltering start, meandering in the unpleasant circumstances of Hamilton's childhood. But as Hamilton enters his teenage years, the narrative gets its focus. The story suddenly takes off. In a few short years, Hamilton rockets from an impoverished Caribbean youth to a brilliant leader of the American Revolution. Chernow takes us along for the ride. Amazing!"
4,Saint Alexander,"This is an excellent, lengthy biography that covers about every inch of turf Hamilton tread. Chernow is a steady writer, but not a genius like William Manchester (""The Last Lion""). Also its pro-Hamilton bias does wear a little, as almost everyone other founder, such as Washington (aloof, unintellectual), Jefferson (evil demagogue) and Madison (calculating turncoat), is deemed unfit to touch the hem of His Lordship, our newly robed Saint Alexander."
4,Alexander Hamilton,"Very well written, very informative, easy reading, excellent details of the life and beliefs of Alexander Hamilton.A historical view of the early years of the forming of the United States Government as we know it today.It is suggested, ""Alexander Hamilton"" be required reading prior to graduating from high school."
1,Real Housewives?,"Looks a lot like my life - except for the houses, the money and the cars.Give me a break - this is as real as plastic surgery."
4,Well....,"I'm going to go ahead and give this a positive review, despite the fact that I do not own it nor have I ever seen it... but I love the Bad Girl line. It reminds me of my Bad Girl days. I started with the Bad Girl's Guide to the Open Road... nothing like learning how to cook on your car and various uses for maxi pads. I purchased the Bad Girl calendar/day planner in 2004... and was having a lot of fun with it, until I got pregnant (unplanned) in late February. That ended my Bad Girl ways, and now they are but a memory... but this address book might be a nice place to keep track of old and new acquaintances... or at least give me an edge at playgroup."
4,Useful,This is a useful program if one wants to take the time to train the program. Sometimes the program will hear one thing and dictate it and what it dictates will be completely different from what you said. Over time and with some patience one can effectively use the product to cut typing time.Overall I would give this product a very good review.
3,Does not save time for me!,"Impressive speech recognition but still makes unacceptable number of mistakes. Editing them, takes away any speed advantage. I am a South Asian physician with electronic medical records. I am still trying to achieve the ultimate goal of being able to get the computer to transcribe. However, still no real joy!Good fun though.Dragon Naturally Speaking Standard V9"
1,Will not work for a non-native!,It doesn't recognize my words and misspells them. Who am I? A non-native but who speaks English with a quite good accent.
2,Bait and Switch ?,"It's great that some users have had good luck, so far, with this software.But my thanks to all of those who wrote to warn potential buyers of problems with this company's customer and technical support. Having worked in technical software support for years in the past, I assure everyone that follow-up is crucial for any sophisticated software.And this is extremely sophisticated software! It should be viewed as an essential COMPONENT of the software.Even WITH good support users are likely to have an occasional bad day, but WITHOUT it, you are SOL!And how can you trust obvious crooks who promise worthless rebates to help you with problems in the future?I really planned to buy the software, but have been persuaded by the warnings to forget it."
3,OK for the price.,This is much better than the previous edition but it still makes typing mistakes and you have to speak clearly and slowly in order for the software to keep up. It does help to relieve the stress on the hands and fingers when typing for hours.
4,"""Squeeze Box"" is a hugely underrated song","Despite the fact that it was chosen as this album's radio single, despite the fact that most radio singles tend to be far from the best number on the albums they're taken from, they got it right this time. The sexual double entendre in the song was the first to draw attention away from ""Louie Louie"", which no one has ever been sure about anyway. A friend of mind and I were speculating about what might have happened if the late Lawrence Welk had noticed the song but hadn't spotted the double meaning, so he puts it on the show one week; ""...on accordion is our own Myron Floren, and on vocals are of course...the liddle Lennon Sisters."""
4,This two-volume set is an indispensible reference,"Dr. Garrett's own Summa Theologica is an indispensable reference work for the theologian. This set is not for the person who wants to be told what to believe. Garrett is neither an advocate nor a storyteller; he is the ultimate research librarian. The footnotes alone contain more information than the entire text of many works. Buy it; put it on your shelf; never again fret away an evening thinking, ""I wonder what Bonhoeffer believed about the intermediate state?&quot"
2,Not Happy In NJ,I was very excited to order this movie for my daughter for a gift. The write up for the product said new condition. The item arrived damaged with significant breakage to the case. I am very disappointed and hope it still works when my daughter opens it for Christmas or it will be returned on Monday!
3,Another cinderella story,The person that I bought this for was a little diappointed in it. She felt that the story was very slow at times.
5,Amazing,This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It has a tiny bit of language but it is still really good. I recommend it for 4+. Great movie!
5,guilty pleasure,"I enjoy this film much more than i probably should for my age. While nothing original, it managed not to feel overly cookie cutter/canned. It's a film that I can watch over and over.The Stepsister's acting is atrocious, but most of the other main characters did well. Good story."
2,Katharine Isabelle and Emily Perkins rock! (unlike the rest of this movie!),"I thought Katharine Isabelle and Emily Perkins both rocked in this movie! I didn't care too much for the rest of the movie, as the plot was very predictable and more geared to the under 18 crowd. But every-time Katharine and Emily had their screen time, the quality of the movie moved up a couple dozen notches. I thought they were absolutely hilarious! The pillow fight and the dance room brawl between the two are scenes that will make your belly ache in laughter. The chemistry between these two Canadian actresses, both stars of the cult horror film Ginger Snaps, is again evident, providing a chance for the two to show their comedic talents. It's too bad that a comedy couldn't be made with just the two of them! How about a TV series?"
2,"Maybe Botanical, but no Boost","Tried this product on my curly, frizzy hair, both on just-after shower hair and during the day. Did not notice ANY difference whatsoever, if anything, my hair seemed drier. Just not for me!"
4,Enjoying,I think the product works very well and am enjoying having curly hair where before it was not so much. Thank you
5,Fantastic,Eureka season 5 is great. I am enjoying the whole story line. I am sorry that this is the final season of Eureka.
3,Wow.,"I hope the rest of this season is not as creepy, horrific, awkward, and depressing as this episode was. I am sure they will pull it off but this season-opening theme is so dominating that it seems it would stifle the usual isolated quirky situations that normally occur per episode. I just didn't like anything about this episode. Nothing at all.I can do the ""dark side"" but it's not really why I started watching Eureka and they filled this episode to the brim with it. The writers are certainly brilliant in this regard - the episode was done extremely well - better than most thriller/horror films out today - but maybe they should create another show to do it with since it just comes off as a downer.Well, that's my two cents anyway. I will certainly be tuning in for future shows."
4,Eureka,It was great I just wish it could have been longer. They seem to be rushing the ending. Really going to miss this show.
2,"Love the show, download never worked though","i downloaded this because I really wanted to see it, but it never worked/downloaded. Maybe I didn't do something right :( but I was very disappointed and didn't want to spend any more money trying it again."
2,Poor Quality Throughout,Rungs are not all straight; Inperfections in wood; Poor finish quality with noticeable color variations; Insert holes larger than rungs;
1,Windsome wood quilt rack.......poor quality,Flimsy.......poor quality.........had to make the holes bigger for the rods to fit in............you touch it and it falls over........terrible...makes me not want to order anything again and this was my first
4,WINSOME QUILT RACK,The product is sturdy and functional. I like the fact that I can hang several quilts/blankets on the various bars. I also like the clean lines of the design.
4,Handy,Handy little item great for easy access in small work area. Only complaint - it is not quite level and tends to rock a little.
3,Heating Pad,The heating pad works well but it has an automatic shut off that only stays on for up to 60 minutes which doesn't work for me and my fibromyalgia. Also it is very small. Not large enough for much of anything.
2,Buy Another Book,"I really didn't like this book. I found the instructions difficult to follow. Sometimes I became extremely frustrated with the directions. Perhaps the problem with this book lies in the photos of the models. Diagrams, instead of the photos, would have made the models easier to make. I recommend another Origami book name ""Essential Origami"" by Steve and Megumi Biddle."
5,Ayumi Hamasaki at her best.,"What's just as popular as Pokémon, but not as cute? Ayumi Hamasaki! Her newest single, holding 4 songs, is brilliant. ""Monochrome"" is currently the #1 song in Japan right now. The other three songs, ""Too Late"", ""End Roll"", and ""Trauma"", are still just as good. If you haven't heard J-Pop yet, this is a good CD to begin with."
4,Trisha's voice is an instrument,"I'd give this CD 4 and a half stars, but couldn't because Amazon wouldn't allow me to do that. I love most songs on Everybody Knows, but the ones I don't like aren't bad- they aren't my cup of tea. I recognize the fact Trisha Yearwood has impeccable talent and that she always picks the best songs in Nashville. The thing I like about Trisha is how she gives each song a different meaning. Every time I listen to her songs, I get something different out of it. Her songs will become classics. I also like how Trisha doesn't oversing her material like other singers around. She has a powerful voice, but knows how to use it effectively in order to convey the appropiate message. I like to call her the thinking singer because you can tell she puts a lot of thought into every note she sings. I cannot wait until she releases new material."
3,Seems to work after 10-14 days,"Product feels good going on, but works better after about 10 days or so than after initial applications.Not bad, but not instant relief, either."
4,Summer of the Monkeys,"This is the first time I have read ""Wilson Rawls"" and, although essentially a children's book, I enjoyed his writing very much. It captures the heart and touches some part of our childhood. The plot was quite interesting as well, with boy things versus girl things, having a sick child who finds a world of expression and selflessness and parents with only a hope of getting her treated due to lack of money, then the twist of fate in things turning out all right."
5,A GREAT BOOK!!!!!,u should definetly read this book! it is beautifuly written and it keeps u on the edge of ur seat. y? u ask? because it is sooooo interesting! buy it now! its awsom!!!!!!!
4,Great & Adventurous!,"This book was wonderful. A story of hope, adventure and learning of life. A story of a young boy who is on a search to find these monkeys worth a valuble reward. Along the way he encounters breath taking mistakes and funny sircumstances.This book is a wonderful one if you like funny and entertaining. It will keep you on the edge of your seat! I couldn't put the book down until I finished it, which was at about 12:00am. It is so good.You must read it; a great summertime book you will absolutely love!"
4,It's not easy to catch a monkey!!!,Summer of the Monkeys is a good book. It's about a boy who finds monkeys and tries to catch them to get alot of money because he's poor and needs money. It's harder than it looks to catch a monkey. If you like this review read thiis book.
5,Staggeringly good!,"Ideal for people who like both monkeys and summer and want to know what would happen if the two combined, or for people who dislike both monkeys and summer but still want to know what would happen if the two combined."
2,THIS IS A DUMB GAME,"I cant get passed the part where the birthday party, and you have to sneak by people to go get the present, can someone help me I dont want to give up on this game! but I HATE the graphics and music, its booring and hard, I reccomend this for adults"
4,brillant album from Hong Kong diva,"For those who are not so sure how powerful the singing of Sandy Lam can be, this is a good chance. In this 1994 album, the diva delivered her utmost through her singing. The outstanding track are ""who can be better than you?"" (track 3) where you can find her voice flying in the air and ""indulgence"" (track 6) where you can feel the lust simmering with her voice. Sandy Lam had placed herself in such a good stead with this well-produced album."
4,GREAT BOOK ON POINTERS AND SETTERS,"Excellent book! Useful informations about breaking, developing attitudes, hunting and field trialling with pointers and setters. Very nice book: who loves hunting dogs must have this item in his/her library. The book might be better (5 stars) with more illustrations/photos."
2,Disappointment,I enjoyed FarCry on my PC.. so this was one of the first games I bought on the Wii..1. Farcry is a good multiplayer game on the PC.. on the Wii there is NO MULITPLAYER (except a two player one on one)... so kind of half the fun of the other Farcry games is gone.2. single playe mode.. the clumsey controls and poor camera work make game play confusing and just an exercise in frustration...
1,Absolutely Terrible,"There aren't too many ways to say this is one of the worst games I have ever played, definitely the worst game on Wii."
3,11-10-07,game play: a lot less than the PC Version but it is still a good game to play. It seems to me that the game was easier in medium than on the PC version medium.graphics: were not as good as i thought it was going to be. 3 out of 5 overall rating.Actor: They had a different actor playing jack which i was dissapointed.Sounds: They had pretty good soundFX.Overall: I was glad i bought this game.
3,"Ok for a quick read, not for research.","I got the book and had it finished in the same day, a good book, very fast. The book is very personal and not full of facts, its a good look at the authors view of Japan, but if your looking for some facts about Japan then try another book."
4,2 Discs 2 Different Styles,"Disc 1 is a lot of club, dance hits with the exception of the last few songs, one of them, my personal favorite on the whole set, is Hybrid's Finished Symphony. Apollo Four Fourty is also quality. The second CD though by far outdoes the first. It's a continuous mix of trance that you can play from Agnelli and Nelson and finish it with Veracocha and think it was all one big miracle of trance. they're mixed very nicely, and have very nice, strong melodies, but not a whole lot of build up. Africa 2000 is my favorite on this disc, because of it's very apparent repeated melody and synth. The CD would have gotton 5 if it had just been the second CD. But for those who like club/dance, the first CD is for you. Recommended"
3,Someone Email me please,Ok I haven't seen this video and when i looked at the reviews 2 people said it was good and 2 people said it was boring so can someone please email me and tell me if it's worth buying it. Or if I'm just better off buying other things with their faces on it. Thanx Peace and Hair Grease Later Dayz Stay *NSYNC
3,Kinda disappointing,"This video was not what I expected at all! I was expecting a lot of *N SYNC footage, not just a bunch of girls having a slumber party! I'm a huge *N SYNC fan, and love anything involving them, but this video was pretty boring."
3,Food has changed a lot in seventy years,"After loving Marjorie Hillis' ""Live Alone and Like It: A Guide for the Extra Woman"" I was hopeful that ""Corned Beef and Caviar"" would offer the same wit, sass, and reasoned optimism for single life. And it almost succeeded. But ""Corned Beef"" is primarily a cookbook, not a guide to life, and so offers little space for Hillis' entertaining prose in between recipes.More unfortunately, the recipes themselves have become surprisingly dated. While I consider myself to be an adventurous cook, I saw very few recipes I'd be tempted to try.That said, ""Corned Beef"" was still somewhat enjoyable to read. It made me think again before serving myself another dinner of microwaved popcorn, and gave me new respect for all of the fresh fruits and vegetables we have available now that weren't so available in the '30s.In short, ""Corned Beef"" is somewhat fun to read, but ""Live Alone and Like It"" is significantly better."
1,Not Good,Told nothing about the life and culture of the Native Americans. Her story regardng her captivity and activities during captivity are not altogether believable. Not worth reading.
3,an interesting read,"I read this book under recommendation of one of my favorite authors Francesca Lia Block. Similar to her writing style I found the book full of wonderful images and poetic language. The sequence of events made me empathize greatly with the characters, although I found the external plot to be somewhat predictable. The book's symbols and underlying themes are ultimately what made it the most interesting and had me thinking once, I completed the book."
3,Coorect Song,"The lyrics go ""I'm not talkin bout movin in, and I don't want to change your life, but there a warm wind blowin, the stars are out and I'd really like to see you tonight"" which is a song by England Dan and John Ford Coley."
5,"""Unknown"" Jars of Clay? hmm","I wonder if he'd still call Jars of Clay ""unknown""? They have two platinum albums and a third that's on the way to platinum status...Anyway, I'm getting this for the song the Jars have on here, ""The Chair"". It's one of their very best, ironically.The rest of the soundtrack seems really solid, too! (Thus the five stars) I guess no one will ever look at this anyway, though, so it doesn't much matter what I say. :-)"
5,Loved it. Watched it 4 times so far.,"This is a unique show that really shows everyday workings at racetracks. From hilarious to deep sadness it touches many emotions. It should be a primer for anyone who wants to own a racehorse. Almost to a fault, it shows the ups and downs, and pitfalls that everyone at the tracks experience. I write this having grown up at the tracks and worked there off and on, myself. Some of the conversations are hard to pick up, because they contain alot of 'track' lingo, spoken with various accents. Even I had to watch it several times to pick up all the details. But I still enjoyed it each time."
3,Very nice,"I'll admit I have not read this book for a very long time, so I gave it 3 stars, but it may be worth even more.I remember it being one of my favourite books ever when I was 12.It's a beautiful fantasy with inventive characters and an engaging story. I recommend."
5,Does it get any better than this?,"I have been a fan of TBS for quite a few years and was once again thrilled with the release of this CD. Jacqueline Abbott has got one of the most beautiful voices and does a great job on the remake of ""Everybody's Talikin'."" If you're not a fan of The Beautiful South...you soon will be after listening to MIAOW. Two thumbs up!"
4,Don't send me used merchandise,"I haven't had a chance to read the book yet, but I paid for a new copy of this paperback and was sent a used copy."
3,Lard Free - 'III' (Spalax),"Originally released in 1977, looks to be Lard Free's third and final album. Basically, it's good French progressive. I've heard this band's name several times before, but never got to check any of their material out for myself until now. Liked hearing the seventeen minute wailing,krautrock-like ""Spirale Malax"". What an experience. Plus, the three parts of ""Synthetic Seasons"" were droning (here, that's a good thing). Drummer Gilbert Artman was apparently the only player on all three lp's. Might possibly appeal to some fans of Colosseum, Gentle Giant, Heldon and maybe Focus."
2,NEXT PLEASE.....,"When I heard this CD all I kept wishing after the first intros to every song was ""next please"" hoping that each succeeding cut would improve the situation. Suffice it to say that the situation DID NOT improve."
4,Using it already,"We're using it already. We had a great time this holidays taking pics without worrying about running out of juice. Thanks,"
5,What a Time Saver,"I have been watercolor quilting for a year now and have found it difficult to complete the projects in a timely manner. All that sewing! Well, no more! Quick Watercolor Quilts is a wonderful book showing a very quick and easy fuse technique which saves valuable time at the sewing machine. Also, the author goes into great detail in the design of curves and angles, which give my projects a more dimensional look. I love this book and can't wait to get started on the four seasons wreath wall hanging for my bedroom!"
5,Beau Marks At Last,"I have been looking for a certain song for over 5 years...""Clap Your Hands"" and nobody remembered it...well I finally found it and am ecstatic!!!!"
4,"Fun for the Children, frustrating for the parents.",I bought this ty for my 7yo son's B-day present. He Loves it and so do the neighbors kids.Problem is that the system is a bit complex for a 7yo. I would recommend it for 9yo and up (my neighbor's child is 9).
4,"Great fun, good exercise","We had our first proper game with these today out in the woods. Everyone had a brilliant time from age 5 (with some help) to age 45. Own the zone was the most popular game. You can play around the house but the beam will bounce off walls making it far too easy to score a tag (even with the 'Indoor' setting). Outside, you actually need to use the sights to score consistent hits. Great fun and good exercise out in the fresh air. The only downside to today's game was that one tagger refused to debrief, messing up the team scores a little. This is the only reason I didn't give 5/5."
1,VERY disappointing,I bought this set for my 8 year old son. It took about an hour just to read the manual to figure out how to play just a basic game. Of course he had lost interest by that time. The instructions are very complicated. Not to mention there isn't a very long range where the laser actually works......we tried it from one side of our driveway across to the other side and it wouldn't work. I suppose if you had older kids who could understand the displays and all the different settings this might be OK but still the range was very disappointing.
5,Just like a video game,"This thing works great! It's a lot better than what everyone says. The HUD is comfortable if you move the velcro strap up high on your head. The light up display is difficult to see when they aren't flashing, but when they do, it looks great. The lock on is a nice addition to it also. Overall, this is EXCELLENT!"
3,"Good, but could have been better!","There are 18 tracks on this CD but don't expect to hear 18 songs. Two of the tracks are dialogue, very brief dialogue at that. The big hits are here but some of the tunes just keep you wondering, ""Wasn't there anything better to choose from?"". The song ""California Earthquake"" with lyrics about the faultline is a waste of time and a talent. ""Disney Girls"" is better but still nothing to write home about. Were it not for Cass's great vocals, close to half of these songs would have wound up in a trashbin. But that said, Cass Elliott herself gives that special something that makes it worthwhile. (But never pay list price for this compilation.)"
5,ABSOLUTELY ONE OF SEIKOS BEST....,"So sorry that Ms. Yang and her husband did not like this watch. It is one of the finest from Seiko. It is big, beautiful and very masculine. Best of all, I got it NEW to my door for 109.00!!!! I guess it pays to shop around and be at the right place at the right time!! I now have all three versions of this watch: Silver with black face, gold with black face and this white face version. This is truly one of my favorites."
1,Great WATCH...BUT,"Great Watch, but the wording on the dial had a manufactory defect. The seller was great and refunded the money."
2,Plymouth Steamman,"This is a good product with two flaws: Replacement Bulbs are Waaaay overpriced.After extended use the light does not come on, due to shorts in wiring."
2,Disappointment,Thought it came with a plug charger and it didn't. Was too expensive with out it. Would not buy again
4,"pretty good, but not as fine as the first two","I own every Claude Challe release- including the seemingly illusive Les Bains Douches, which is one of the finest. When Nirvana Lounge was released I was suspicicious because it was done by a guy called Ravin- where had Claude Challe got to? However, on multiple hearings Nirvana Lounge proved every bit as beguiling as the marvellous Buddha Bars 1 & 2. So it was without hesitation that I bought this latest Buddha Bar 3........ a little disappointing........ it just does not hang together so well as the others- seems not to have so much thought put into the continuity- I smell a bit of ""cashing in"" on the success of the other releases. Nevertheless there are some fine tracks e.g Talvin Singh, Frédérick Rousseau & Ravi Prasad. By the Way- I picked up Bains Douches 2 in Paris recently- again a slight disappointment, considering the great first release. Where are you Claude? Come back and give us a storming new release with your name on it."
5,Weaving disparate sounds together,"Buy this CD and listen to it. In doing so you allow your mind to go on a journey. Start by imagining yourself reclining in a comfortable and lavish lounge in Paris... close your eyes, you will roam far and wide over Mediterranean soundscapes from places like Morocco, Andalucian Spain, Algeria. Enjoy the atmospheres it invites you to drink in. The disks may seem expensive, but the trip they offer requires no plane tickets... just the music."
4,"Great album, wish I could find the CD.","I got this cassette from a friend 13 or so years ago, just about worn out, I would love to find the CD. Any thoughts or suggestions, please write.Mike"
5,Perfect!,"I was never really a fan of Aqua till I revisited the second album ""Aquarius"". After giving the album a chance once again, I realized how much I loved it. I even found myself listening to the debut ""Aquarium"" too. Now that Aqua has long broken up, I wanted to see what the members have been up to these days. I see that Lene put out this debut CD which I sampled on her website. I wasn't too thrilled with the samples, but didn't want to forget about her so fast. I found a website where I actually listened to four songs off the album in streaming audio. I was impressed with her vocals and the overall sound and production of her album. The only way to go with this album is the Japanese bonus track album. I finally received it in the mail today and I love it so much. It seems Lene only let a side and a 1/2 of her show in Aqua. ""Play With Me"" is here coming out party. Recommended!!"
3,Becoming promiscuous?,"I think Lene is very talented and can sing very well, but I do believe that her songs are ridiculous. Her album did horrible and I believe it's because she's lost her.. G rating. I was shocked when Aqua broke up, but I waited for a long time for her CD and I must say, it was pretty disappointing. There are a few songs, but it seems like the rest are there just to make enough for a CD. I really hope she makes another album.. but puts more effort into it. It's not ALL about sex."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"I wasn't a huge fan of Aqua, I mean I enjoyed their albums but I always felt like Lene was holding her vocals back, the only time u really got a glimpse of her vocal capcity was in the ballads.Anyways, I really really like this Album, with a rock alternative edge too it, it reminds me a bit of Gwen Stefani (NO doubt). for those of u who are expecting Aqua type songs and themes you may not like it.But Lene has a great Album that she's put out, fun songs without coming off as cartoony and great lyrics,playful yet in a more mature manor.over all her vocals are so great!You can tell she put her all into it and did a great job.Stand out tracks, Virgin Superstar,Pretty Young thing,It's ur duty, PLay with me,We wanna party, and Pants up."
3,More Mid than Hi,"The Xitel Hi Fi Link produces better sound than obtained thru the headphone output of my powerbook G4, however, you will be disapointed if you connect it to a high-end sound system as the sound is very digital and lifeless. It works best for social/casual listening and for that purpose, it's a good value at the amazon.com price."
5,Outstanding accessory for a laptop,"I purchased the HiFi-Link for connecting my laptop to the stereo in my family room while listening to the Rhapsody music service. I read good reviews here so I ordered one - I was not disappointed. I connected the USB cable, Windows XP installed the drivers and I was up in running in seconds.Originally I was connecting from the headphone jack of my laptop to a stereo, and while the sound was adequate, it wasn't what I would consider 'CD Quality'. There was a very noticeable improvement after connecting up the HiFi link and listening to my first song. The sound quality is great and I had no issues with hum or noise - the device really works as advertised.Bottom line, for the small investment you can't go wrong with the HiFi Link."
5,A Simple Solution,"I've sold all of my CD's, and I don't miss them! I use my iMac and my HiFi-Link exclusively when listening to music at home. You'll get the fullest sound quality possible out of any MP3 collection with this basic HiFi-Link (the pro model is overkill for music)."
1,Sound quality is deplorable.,"I beg to differ with other positive reviews here. I'm using a 700mhz iBook with OS X. The operating system saw the device right away, and it worked flawlessly. The sound quality, however, was much, much worse than my home CD Player/NAD amp/B & W speakers. The sound quality out of the Xitel unit was very close to the sound quality coming straight off the analog headphone jack of the iBook. My thought when I heard the unit was, ""[a few of my hard earned bucks]something that boosts my levels a little, but sounds no better..."" I'm sorry Xitel, you'll have to do better than this. Try at least to sound as good as a $50 portable CD player, and then I'll be interested."
1,Pure fantasy but good enough for the Christian Conspiracy theorist,"Im sure some who are gullable will eat this mess up, Its pure hear say with no documentation other than this Satanic lunatics word. And of course thats all it his word and to many have taken it to heart. The only good thing about this book was that it made for good toilet paper"
1,Don't Focus Your Energy on Negativity,"The author of this book supports a fringe group involved with the grisly murders of two people very close to His Holiness the Dalai Lama.Their destructive actions are condemned by all other sects of Buddhism (actual Tibetan Buddhism).All of this over worship of a demon.I would not reccomend this book to anyone, it is geared toward the practitioners this group has vowed to destroy, so, do the math."
4,Gotta bump this,"When I first heard ""I Do!!"" this past spring, I loved it, so I was really looking foward to buying Toya's entire CD to see what she was all about. I'm glad I did. A lot of new artists try to go everywhere (ballads, pop, rap, acoustics) and fail, while Toya has a cool style and stays true to what she's good at - R&B/Rap/Hip-Hop. I believe there's only 1 or 2 slow songs, and they're actually good. She has a strong voice and this CD is like, the only CD I can imagine putting on at a party. It's fun, fast, and enjoyable. If you're looking for depth, hidden messages, and soul-searching, don't look here - Toya's all about being straight-up and honest in her lyrics and songs. Buy it!! :)"
4,Damn Good but Hard to Find,"After many many years, I've been searching for this album from my hometown in the Philippines even up to my overseas assignments in Indonesia, Guam and Singapore. Up to NOW, I haven't been lucky to get hold of this album...like a Phantom of the Footlight!This is really a very good rock jazz fusion albums I've enjoyed exclusively only over Manila's DZRJ radio station's heydays in the late 70's or early 1980s.Is there a way you can find this rare album around the Asia Pacific region?Thanks.DENNIS PURUGGANANManila"
2,Love? Not so much - Fabric tears at stitching,"Have one - Used it ~20 times and loved it, but the stitching started to tear at the seam right about where your butt sits (I'm ~160 lbs). The FRAME is rated for 225 lbs, but the fabric sure isn't."
1,Boring,This movie was so boring. the only thing i can say what i liked about this movie was brad pitt's acting. but other than that i found it boring. thats because i really don't know much about baseball. it was just not my type of film. if you are a hardcore baseball fan then this movie is for you. if not then i don't recommend this movie.
4,Moneyball,"I'm not a big baseball fan, but this movie was good. Brad Pitt was believable as well as everyone else."
4,Overall good movie,"Overall this was a good movie, not $9 movie ticket good, but a good movie overall to watch. I would recommend it."
2,Streaming awful,The movie was excellent but when streaming it we lost connection several times. Not sure I will use Amazon again to watch a movie.
1,Boring,Just want to rate not review the movie. I wasted too much time on it already. Basically I hated it.........
2,Baseball movie actually duller than baseball,"Thrill to the general manager interacting repeatedly with his daughter and ex-wife. Jeer at the late-middle-aged baseball scouts arguing around a table. Stare at the supporting cast talking on phones, sitting at desks, walking down halls, spitting from dugouts, and chatting in locker rooms. Two stars for the fat statistician, who steals all his scenes."
3,Overrated,"I follow baseball and aware of the concept here but I found this movie lacking something. Whether it was little more depth of why this is important or maybe more details on the process. All we saw is 1 idea, 1 manager who made the change and a bunch of old timers who didn't want to change. All that's based on 20 game winning streak. I would have really liked more details about it, just on base % is not all of it. I think acting was fine, just script came up short."
3,Meh...,"I don't know why, but I've always liked baseball movies, so I probably liked this movie more than it deserved. ""Moneyball"" is interesting, in that it is a true story, but the movie itself is a little slow. Brad Pitt was good.O.k. but not recommended."
5,Moneyball is a Windfall,This movie was purchsed for viewing by my son who is a Blue-Ray junkie and has an extensive collection of blu-ray movies. He thoroughly enjoyed the movie the first time around and will watch it again and again.
4,Enjoyed,"Had read book and the book goes into more detail about statistics, so was not sure how the story would bebtold in a movie. Thought it was well done."
3,Moneyball,"I thought it moved slowly in the beginning. This movie was ok, but I was expecting much more since I'm a big sports fan."
1,Great film. Returning. Ultraviolet is not true digital copy.,"Love tis film. Fave of last year. But I will return and never buy another ultraviolet copy again. I want a digital copy that works on pc and Mac, even though I only own apple products, it's a joke I can't seamlessly save a digital copy and continue to upgrade my digital media collection. I pay for all my media. I want to watch in high def from 35000 ft with out concern for bandwidth. So....Warner Bros. get with the program. Ultraviolet will not work. iPad user primarily."
3,Money ball,A good performance by Brad Pitt. Some of the A's general manager negotiations weren't real but overall very entertaining.
2,good premise but cliche driven,"Charlie is a woman who reluctantly accepts an assignment at the detective agency co-owns with her brother. She is the business manager not the detective. However she does what any spunky woman does and ignores good advice, puts herself in jeopardy, repeats stupid moves and continues to make dumb choices until she solves the crime. Bleh. Give me a break. It is so cliche that I cannot believe anyone who had read good detective fiction would bother with this.Try JA Jance's books for a good, well written Southwest heroine."
4,Good debut novel,"Charlie Parker, an accountant who dabbles in solving mysteries, is given an unusual assignment. Her ex-husband's new wife, Stacy, has asked her to locate her Rolex watch before her husband discovers that it was stolen by a man with whom she had an affair. Charlie succeeds in doing this, but meanwhile the man who stole the watch is killed. Then, Charlie really has to use her investigative skills because she feels that Stacy is being unjustly accused of the murder. This well-written book is the beginning of the Charlie Parker series, which is set in Albuquerque. It is recommended reading for mystery fans."
3,Just okay.,"I didn't find this book overly interesting, actually it was very easy to put down. Characters were developed but not to a point that I liked any of them. Charlie was just okay, nothing about her stands out. I don't see myself reading any of the other books in the series unless there is absolutely nothing else for me to read."
2,blaise,The heroine is okay-some like her but she is little too fake for me. The plot is predictable and about 1/2 way through you can figure out end.
4,Deadly Gamble,After reading the first book in the series I have ordered the rest. I notced that no.3 partners can kill is not available on Kindle. Hopefully that will be remedied in the very near future. I realy enjoyed the firstbook. A fast read. Can not wait to see what kind of trouble Charlie finds herself in next time.
5,Wonderful Reading,A great read that really makes you think about all you have in life. I bought copies of this book for several people on my holiday list last year.
3,By No Means a Classic,"Some of the material is sparse and lacking in form or hook. And this was only an EP! The better tracks here are on the ""Hip Priest and Kamerads"" CD version, so I recommend that instead."
1,Amazing,"It still amazes me that people like Pring can sell books and seminars to so many gullibles, given these ""experts"" probably never made a penny from actual trading."
1,"High in Fat, Low in hot speices","I can still remember the hideous feeling after looking at my oily fingers after holding a piece of this thing. I could not imagine the amount of fat. So, I put a piece in my oven and after two minutes. The surprise was a lot offat that could give me a nice heart stroke. I am forced to get rid of the whole pouches."
1,Trash for soft-headed saps,"If you're idea of naturalism is wearing Birkenstock sandals, talking about ""animal nature in the eyes of wolves"" while sipping overpriced twig tea from your local health food store -- well then, this is the book for you. Simplistic metaphors for suburban housewives to nod in appreciation of their own smug self-satisfaction, this collection of muck passing for art is trite and without any enduring significance. Once again low forms of writing have captured the soft, mushy minds of the unthinking and given them the wrapper of meaning without the content. The seriously dysfunctional seem to find some solace in these pages so for that I'll give it a single star... just as long as it keeps them off the streets."
4,suitable historical perspective,"Calculus was discovered by Newton and Liebniz in the 1600s. They used a method of infinitesimals to derive their results. To this day, infinitesimals are used as an intuitive explanation of calculus, to scientists and engineers. But to many mathematicians, there is an unsettling lack of rigour.Grabiner explains how this state of affairs from the 1600s persisted until Cauchy [and others] came along. He found an epsilon -delta approach that permits a strict derivation of theorems. This book should give an appreciation of that approach, in a suitable historical perspective."
2,Quidad is So-So,"This shampoo is no better than any drugstore shampoo, except that it costs about 4 times as much. Does absolutely nothing for my hair but clean it. Fragrance is okay. Bottle is nothing special, so I can't even justify that it looks pretty in my shower."
4,excellent,"A friend of mine made me a copy of this years ago, so I don't have access to artists or song titles. I can tell you that this is quality from end to end, sticking to basic, three minute single funk grooves.How Good is Good is comprised of tracks that are not particularly polished northern, OR gritty southern soul, opting instead for solid, accessible grooves that were probably made around 1970 or 1971. All local talent and all very good. Absolutely worth the price if looking for a extremely consistent and enjoyable funk comp."
4,will take you home,"did you ever work a hard job for little pay? love someone you just couldn't reach? well this music comes from a film that will take you home. rose royce really hits t on the mark. my review is as much about the film car wash as it is the music. you may have to be over 40 to understand, but if you have ever been there, hated it, but wouoldn't trade the experience for any $$ this is the music and film for you"
1,Garbage,"I thought this book would calm down my angry teenage son. It absolutely did not! If you manage to find the ingredients (which is nearly impossible,) and follow the unclear instructions the end result is often stomach turning."
1,"Agreed, ruined",Way to mess up a really good resource John Haig. Please do us a favor and do not revise any more Japanese reference books.
4,Smooth,"This CD is a great dance or chill out album. Good to listen to before going to the clubs, driving through the city or just hanging out. Tony Humphries is the man."
1,Find a better book!,"I received the 2003 edition (exact same cover) as a gift and although I absolutely love Greek mythology, I gave this book away because it was so poorly edited. The number of typos and misuse of punctuation completely ruined this book for me. I will be looking for one that's written / edited better!"
5,A Study of How to investigate a deep sea wreck,"Peter Limburg has done a considerable amount of research on a number of ships and planes that have gone down to the depths. Unlike Shadow Divers, which covers just one wreck, Peter Limburg's book covers the details of the work done to investigate a number of undersea wrecks, such as The Derbyshire, the Gaul, the Flare, the Lucona, the Marine Electric, the Rema, the Estonia, the Edmund Fitzgerald and quite a few others.It's amazing the amount of time and money that was expended to find out the cause of these disasters. Technical details of the equipment used are included to give as complete report as possible."
2,Keurig Coffee Carousel,The idea is good but one of the little coffee holders was broken off when we received it. So it must not be put together too well and may break with use.
5,Nice way to display K-Cups,Does what it is supposed to. Displays K-Cups very nice. A few of the holders didn't seem to be perfectly aligned but it wasn't enough to bother me at all. Looks great all filled and spins nice. I was afraid of it not spinning well or spinning too much but it's just right.
1,I was snowed by the average 4 star review:(,"I completely ignored all the 1 & 2 star comments since the overall average was so high. Shame on me. It arrived with a broken ring. If I had taken the time to read the other reviews, I would have found that this is the overwhelmingly common complaint. So I'm yet another sucker for this product. It's ashame because it is pretty, holds lots of K-cups without taking up much room on my counter."
5,Keurig K Cup Holder,This product is great. It does exactly what it's supposed to do and has a very nice look to it. Definitely a must have if you are a Keurig Coffee owner!!
1,cheaply made,"When I received this, one ring was broken off. It is cheaply made. Returning for a refund."
3,"Nice, but not necessary","This is handy, but takes up counter space and once a person has determined which coffees they like, they will only have 3 or 4 flavors on hand which can be stored in their individual boxes in a cupboard."
4,K-cup Carousel,Great accessory for the Keurig coffee pot. Though it was a bit wider than I anticipated. Make sure you have the counter space.
3,Lost a ring within a week...,"This looks nice and performs it's function well for the most part. Our only issue was that a ring fell off the bottom in the first week. The rest seem sturdy enough. An annoyance, not a deal breaker."
4,Good Display / Organizer,Nice design - much nicer than the few others I have seen out there. Good capacity too.
3,We Use It...,"We definitely use this (had it 3-4 years), but there are some issues:1. For what you get, it's expensive.2. My coffee area (where the Brewer is) is a small, very defined space. This carousel eats a lot of that space up. However, I continue to use it because it allows easy access to different types of coffee, tea, and/or hot choclate and it offers it quickly!Do I love it? No. But I do like it."
5,He loved it,"He loved the red tape , he also received new drumsticks he will use the tape for them. Thank you!"
5,Great Quality Conditioner,"I have long, color treated/highlighted, spirally curly hair. I have tried many other salon quality formulas for curly hair as well as drug store products and ouidad is the conditioner I keep going back to. You don't have to use much at all and it makes hair feel like silk. It smells great and one bottle will last you about 3 months. It is also safe for color treated hair and packed with natural ingredients. Other people with curly hair compliment me and ask me what products I use and I always tell them about Curl Quencher. I have used this conditioner for a number of years. Although ouidad did change the curl quencher formula I have to say it was only an improvement over the old formula. I refuse to use anything else."
1,"Sadly, They Don't Make 'Em Like They Used To","Bought this iron to replace a similar Black & Decker iron we had for 10 years. Just needed something for some silk blouses that had to be hand-washed and ironed. Noticed immediately that the control layout was cramped and hard to use, especially compared to the older iron. When we tried to use it, the spray ""mist"" came out more like a blown rain storm spotting the silk. Then it started leaking slowly from around the tank. Very poor workmanship. Returned it immediately for a refund (thank you Amazon!)."
3,Got value for money...,It is good for the price I have paid... but it has a little bit of leakage and the steam buttons does not work at maximum.... Other wise it is a great product...
3,Nothing Spectacular,This iron has all the basic functionalities. Don't expect miracles for that price.Overall its a good value for the price !!
3,Great DVD - one big problem,"This disc will not play in my XBOX 360. Another reviewer had issues as well. I can only watch it on my PC with VLC. Not good. Someone really dropped the ball in the manufacturing of this DVD. So if you plan on buying it, plan on watching it on your PC.I won't go much into the DVD itself. Lots of live tunes. The Queers live are much like the Ramones, loud, fast, short. I much prefer their studio recordings but interesting nonetheless. Lots of old tunes, couple music videos. I wish the interviews with Joe were done better and not in some basement or stairwell, but hey, its punk.Been a Queers fan since 1994, I am 31 now and time will never change this fact."
4,Recommended,"I wish there were more levels in this game. The game is fun, as is, but I personally wish it was more challenging."
2,Tasty but where's the beef?,"Ok, I know this is turkey and not beef. It tasted really good but there isn't much actual turkey jerky in the pouch. You could finish an entire bag as a small snack. The product is advertised as 4 oz but the bags I received were only 3.5 oz and I question if that included the weight of the bag."
3,Great Taste - but has soy sauce,These are very tender and tasty - perhaps too sweet. I wish they could have skipped adding soy sauce and just had a more plain variety with minimal added ingredients.
2,Okay,"I was expecting it to be better written. The characters didn't jump off the page, and in fact, weren't all that likable. I tried to read it several times, but finally gave up after about 70 pages. Read the Grapes of Wrath instead. That's what I was hoping for, something along those lines."
1,Do Not Recommend,"Although this bag is pretty to look at, the fabric is not practical for a diaper bag, as it seems that it would snag easily. Also, the top zipper is too small--does not go to the very edges of the bag--making it hard to put items in and take them out. Also, it's too tall, therefore, taking out items from the bottom is much too difficult, and it doesn't have large enough pockets for organization of lotions, mom's wallet, etc.The other disappointment was that the company does not pay for return shipping, or include a return label if you are not satisfied, so not only did it cost $6.50 to receive it, it cost $6.50 to return."
3,"Informative, but re-cycled","Almost every chapter in AGES is duplicated in Jackson's more voluminous ""Man God and Civilization"", but AGES is still an excellent dissertation on ancient civilizations, especially for those who may not have time to read MG&C.Starting with the ""Early Stages of the World,"" Jackson visits Egyptian, Chinese, Greek and Roman societies, among others, to dissect events that contributed to their respective risings and fallings. Islam and Christianity are also looked at for their roles in developing societies. (He pulls no punches -- Jackson is a proud atheist.)Persons interested in African contributions to modern society should consider this a must read. I'd give it five stars if, again, most of the info wasn't already in the other book."
4,Twisted Psycho Fairy Princess Sings the Blues,"This song (""Pretty Polly"") kept me awake and amazed - how does she DO that with her voice? The sometime-girlishness, often-hauntedness will leave you desperate to buy the whole great big album, even if it is an import where you live."
5,Nivea's Debut Album,"This album really surprised me. Nivea shows us all sides of her personality in this album. We see her softer, romantic side in Reasons and Have Mercy as well as her more bolder, strong side in Check Your Man and Jewlery. This album I believe has something for everyone and getting this album is a must for anyone who enjoyed her singles Dont Mess With My Man and Run Away."
4,brill!,"for a first debut cd this is brilliant! but as a cd on the whole it aint all that... its addictive and fun to dance to e.t.c but you can't help feeling the lyrics are a little cleche!most of the songs are fantastic! like ""problems"" i love because it's simply different! i love the harmony she brings into it using backing vocals and i love ""laudromat"" its so cool! its the kind of song you'd expect to be put in a broadway show! a really good album and definately will not take it back! but its not really worth blood and sweat to get it as soon as poss! good effort Nivea and dont give up!"
4,Don't mess with Nivea!,"So, I didn't think that I'd like this album because I wasn't impressed with her video for ""Don't Mess Wit the Radio"" which came out a long time ago. But then when Nivea returned to the see with ""Don't Mess With My Man"" and ""Laundromat,"" I was open. The album is off the hook. She's got a lot of funky blends and her voice has so much control.Still in Love - 3/5Ya Ya Ya - 3/5Don't Mess With My Man - 5/5The One For Me - 4/5Laundromat - 5/5 *EXCELLENT TRACK*You Don't Even Know - 4/5Run Away - 5/5 (Neptunes-produced)Just In Case - 4/5No Doubt - 3/5Never Had A Girl Like Me - 4/5Have Mercy - 4/5Don't Mess With The Radio - 4/525 Reasons - 5/5"
4,"A sweet, heartwarming read","I enjoyed this book very much. The writer did an excellent job of weaving a great deal of truths/wisdom about life in this story. Stephen and Rosalind were wonderfully mature characters. I wouldn't call this book a romance, though. It reminded me more of a family novel. The romance ended halfway through the book and there was little conflict between Stephen and Rosalind. They were far too cordial and loving from the time they met to make for an exciting, heated romance. This book will touch your heart but it won't make it pound."
5,Mad for Books,"This is my favorite of all Ms. Putney's books. For sheer romance; love; and an incredible plot line, you couldn't ask for more. The characters are admirable and very human. I've read it more than 5 times and it just gets better. If you believe in life after death - this is for you!"
1,Plain and simple I didn't like this book,I thought this book would be good--but I was very frustrated by this book. I tried on two different occasions to get into this memoir but I gave up each time. I know I won't try again that's for sure.
4,Very funny easy read,"I really enjoyed this book! I read the entire book while on a plane, and found myself trying not to laugh out loud several times. I'm not a fat girl, but found Wendy's exploits funny all the same, and could definitely relate to some of her experiences. I have actually recommended it to several of my friends which I don't often do."
5,Reinvigorates Jaded Souls,"This is the CBS Sunday morning special aired a few days after Kuralt passed away. It is touching, to say the least. Watching each vignette, you gain appreciation for Kuralt's rare talent. Unlike other reporters who tend to burn their bridges, he left a wake of goodwill. From the man in NC who devoted his retired years to fixing bicycles to lend out to area children, to the Afghan who got married and became a citizen in one weekend, to the stirring rendition of founding father oratory that led to the signing of the Declaration of Independence -- we are given a multifaceted look at what it means to appreciate the finer points of life. Bravo."
5,Amazing,"I thought that this CD was going to be a meditational type. BOY was I wrong! It is very similar to a 90's pop/rock type. I loved it. Having met Christian, I can totally appreciate his music."
5,Eiffel 65's Blue Da Ba dee,"A GREAT new pop song by a new european band that is sure to win fans with this toe tappin' single. Blue (Da ba Dee) is a new twist that will keep you dancing non-stop. Wait for it on your local hit music radio station, then turn the volume WAY up and watch it roll!"
5,Great Material,"Great Material, entertaining and interesting at the same time.Unfortunately, the West-European DVD-Player won't read it, so I have to see it on the PC or Labtop.I was informed about this fact before I bought it.Enjoy the material!Paul"
5,the best reality show ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,this is the best show i have been praying for this day to come for months it is the only reality shoe with style and class(and all of the omorosa you can take). GO TRUMP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,"dream drives them to the opportunity,but they are hit by the reality!","The show: Well-structured, Well-performed and Well-done!The candidates: Young, Smart and Ambitious!The host: Cut-throat, Killing and Straight-forward!Compared to the other similar reality TV shows, this one is pretty outstanding in terms of the smartness especially on the candidates. This makes the show more sophiscated in comparison with the others which are more entertaining.A piece of advice - Let the Rising Stars Shine more (all the chosen candidates), Leave the already Shining Star a bit behind (Mr. Trump)!"
4,Everyone Loves Nico...,"Ok, this is a good collection of songs. I would have like to see, however, some more tracks on here. The songs here are great (sans the ""Im Not Saying"" and ""Last Mile"" single which is good but forgettable) but what about ""Facing the Wind"", ""Julius Ceasar"", ""Evening of Light"", ""Roses in the Snow"", ""The Falconer"", ""Mutterlein"", ""It Has Not Taken Long"", ""Innocent and Vain"", and ""We've Got the Gold"". Well you know what I'm saying. Go by this as it is a great collection of music, it's just that there is so much more than this."
5,fabulous re-mastering!,"This CD exceeded my expectations. I wanted the original recording that I had when I was a teenager, and was pleased when I found a remastered version. But I was ecstatic when I heard it! The original version and artists, but with a bigger, fuller sound that I never heard on my vinyl album! :-) Isn't technology wonderful?"
3,this one is okay,"this recording of jesus christ superstar is okay, but i prefere the new london cast recording with Glenn carter as jesus christ and Jerome pardon plays a better verison of judas then Murray Head.Ian Gillian does not play a good Jesus.If i were you, i would get the new 2001 cast recording than this one"
2,One word: Pathetic,"This CD is so cheesy, it's like, not even funny. I bought this CD for the title song alone. The title song and ""Juda's Death"" are the only good songs. I listened to the rest of the CD, and it was lame. The ""Trial before Pilate"" was so cheesy. The whip lashes in the song ""Trial Before Pilate on the CD were so fake. There was no emotion in any of the CD. Gethsemane was lame, too. Take my advice. If you want the ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" CD, get the one with Steve Balsamo. It's MUCH better than this one."
5,Absolutely the Best!!,I cannot stop playing this cd. Never heard of this one and thought I would give it a try. What a score. Every song has me singing along. Too bad this cd was not released in the US.
3,Off the mark not good,This cd they were trying to hard to get some people who wanted a different sound from the bee gees & the out come of this is that this is a awful cd. Dont buy it.
3,Not like the real Bee Gees,"Despite the Bee Gees' second tragic loss of their Brother, Maurice, I'll have to contend with this album. Most of the songs are rock and are quite uninteresting--usually when you like a song, time flies by--but not this time. However, the album has its good points--the sorrowful ""Secret Love"" and emotional ""Only Love"". But, this album lacks the ""How Deep Are Your Loves"" and the ""Stayin' Alives"". I just kept saying to myself that the Bee Gees didn't really think this album through with its speedy-rock music.You'll hear the difference when their album Main Course is compared to High Civilization. You wouldn't even begin to think that this was the Bee Gees performing in this album. Quite a difference--from R&B to fast-paced rock."
5,Sublime & Highly Inspired Performances!,"Almost stereo-like mono recording, but due to Royal Festival Hall's cavernous acoustics, the concerto requires attentive listening to appreciate the brilliance of Rubinstein's playing, especially in faster passages. Slow movement of the concerto is more vividly captured, and what a sublime and delicate playing! Solo works are better recorded and presents Rubinstein at his best as supreme Chopin interpretor. Andante spinato is one of the finest recordings made by the pianist."
1,tacky!,"I read this book in one evening and was disappointed to have wasted my time. I found its suggestions tacky and/or rude. Have your wedding sponsored by local companies--tacky. Announce your engagement via e-mail--why not? I did. E-mail your wedding invitations--not if you want anyone over the age of 16 to take you seriously! Omit the stamp on each reply card--rude. Instead of asking your girlfriends to be bridesmaids, ask them to help in other ways, because then you don't have to get them gifts--sure you don't, but if you don't at least thank them, they're going to see you for the cheapskate you are! (Been there, done that.) Well, that's only one-quarter of the near-200 pages of awful suggestions. My suggestion? Skip this book!"
4,Psychohistorical origins of world war 2,"Dr. Beisel's ""the Suicidal Embrace"" is a psychohistorical approach to understanding the subconscious fantasies associated with the causes of World War 2. Perhaps his most intriguing and controvertial segment in his work lies in his study of Czechoslovokia, the small, baby country in the middle of Europe,which was perhaps the prize which Hitler saw as his to take. Dr. Beisel dissects many of the infantacidal fantasies associated with killing the newly formed child country of Czechoslovokia in the fantastical family of European nations. ""The Suicidal Embrace"" also discusses the irrational and impulsive military decisions on the part of Hitler, which led to Germany's defeat,and provides psychological evidence that these irrational mistakes were not mere 'blunders', as traditional history often claims."
5,Everything you need to know to find the perfect shows,"This book contains the location, dates, application deadlines, expected attendance,booth price,size of booth,who the show is geared to, if there is a fee for the public to get in the show, how many booths there will be, if there will be food or not, and what else will be going on at the show such as parades, games, entertainment,ect. The BEST book I've ever found to plan sucessful shows to participate in. You WILL be happy with this book. I am eagerly looking forward to the 2001 edition!"
5,Inspiring music!,"Elfman is amazing! I'm still waiting to get the first volume, and from the second album's scores, i know it will be worth the wait. He is my favorite composer for his haunting melodies! My favorite tracks were the EDWARD SCISSORHANDS themes, NIGHTMARE BEFORE X-MAS, BLACK BEAUTY and DOLORES CLAIBORNE! ALL of them kept me listening for more. I recommend this album not only for elfman fans, but anyone who enjoys a composers music who can feel the talent in his albums! Great job danny!"
2,What were these guys thinking?,Nat Adderly & Frank Rosolino sound like they are playing brass kazoos! Nobody seemsrehearsed. This just seems like a group of talented high school musicans thrown together.
3,broken product,"I assembled the bike for my daughter for christmas a few days ahead of time. The fork was TOO SMALL for the wheel. I called the company's customer service number and THEY WEREN'T ANSWERING ON THE FRIDAY BEFORE CHRISTMAS.I had to take the bicycle to a bike shop to have it fixed.So, I just helped you identify a company that sells a defective product through your website. What are you going to do for me?"
5,"""Sizzelin, Sultry, Sexy and Seductive""","I have followed Chaka Khan from the moment I first heard her. I am the type of person who loves originality, something that we don't see a heck of alot these days. Her music has been remade by many, but few can deliver her songs the way she does. I once saw her in person, she didn't really need a mike. Her voice can penatrate your soul no matter where you are sitting. Her voice is like fine wine, it only get's better with time!! I have collected all of her albums on wax, but I am now in the process of changing them over to CD's. I am overjoyed to have the opportunity to capture the wonderous voice of Chaka again. She is a must if you are a collector of music like I am."
1,defective lid-very disappointing,"This was a beautiful dutch oven out of the box, but both my husband and I were not able to get the lid to rest flat. We noticed that there was a bump on the lip of each side of the lid which caused it to rock back and forth. I was so disappointed because I have a 4 qt round Staub cocotte that we love and was really looking forward to cooking bigger meals in this pan. I noticed that another reviewer cited the same lid problem. I wonder if I got his returned cocotte because ours looked like a return. Someone else has peeled the inspection sticker from the inside of the pan (I could see where it had been) and then while flipping through the pamphlet that came with the pan, I saw that someone had stuck the sticker (said something like inspected by Frederick) on the back page."
5,"I'm a Searing, Roasting, Stewing Fool!!","This was our first dutch oven. After watching food network for over a decade, we finally wanted to make a few recipes that require dutch ovens. I bought this pot for my wife this past Christmas. There hasn't been a weekend since she unwrapped it that it hasn't been used. We use it one to two times a week. I don't know how we went all these years without one. The size is just right for all the recipes we have used. I can't believe how well it holds such a hot temperature, which is great for searing meat. I definitely recommend this pot. We went with the Pesto Green color. The color really pops out perfectly, not too olive-y not too lime-y."
5,Very pleased,This product has met all our expectation. Its quality is superior and its exterior look is beatuiful. Whe spent 3 weeks in France this summer and my son used the cast iron cookware and was hooked. He used the LeCreuset brand so that is what he wanted. After much research I felt the Staub cookware was a better product so I purchase it for him. I was right. He is much happy with the quality and proformance of the Staub cookware both are very good products but the Staub is a step above. I will continue to buy him more of this cookware. He is a gourmet and takes his cooking seriously. I reap the benefits
3,Not a Vic Morrow video,"This movie features Rick Jason rather than Vic Morrow. Telly Savalas is the guest star. Lt. Hanley and crew are cut off and have a wounded soldier that needs help. Telly Savalas wishes to blow up a fuel dump and refuses to assist the Americans until they help him. While somewhat entertaining, those who are expecting to see Vic Morrow will be sadly disappointed."
1,Don't do it!,"I wish I had read the reviews before I bought the book. Any 5th grader could write a better book about this subject - all they would need is just a little research. I rarely believe any of the product reviews that are available, but in this case, please believe me and the others. Keep your money."
3,an pretty good binocular,"Found a loose fitting on one of the eye pieces. Otherwise ok for the price. Beautifully collimated, bright and clear. (Have since tried ordering other binoculars, and found them impossibly collimated: I didn't realize how hard it is to get a set of inexpensive binoculars that work properly.)"
3,Good elementary facts on the Faith movement.,"This thin booklet will give you just some of the introductory facts on the Word of Faith movement. Since it only has about 40-50 pages, it won't sink its teeth very deep into the subject, but it's a good start if you want to know more about the Word of Faith. I would recommend ""Christianity in Crisis"" if you want a more in-depth analysis. But start here with ""The Facts"", and plus it's very inexpensive."
1,A Boring Antique Opera,"I am probably not a fair reviewer of this opera. I purchased it because I like Ponnelle productions. I find these earlier operas horribly boring, the music unmoving and orchestration annoying (strumming a harp for instance). In my opinion there is only one memorable aria but you can get this on opera highlight CDs. The story is incomprehensible and would appeal to the intelligentsia of opera."
2,"Good beginning, then downhill","I was reading The Mambo Kings Sing Songs of Love, a (I believe) Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by one Oscar Hijuelos upon which the movie THE MAMBO KINGS was based. I did something totally uncharacteristic of me: I junked it! It started out as a very interesting character study and a fascinating portrait of a particular time and place (NYC in the early 50s, in particular the Latin-American communities). However, at the point at which I gave up, it was leaning heavily on rather endless explorations of the sex lives of the two protagonist, depicted in great detail. Not my cup of tea, I can assure you! Oh well...money down the tubes!"
2,What a disappointment,"Would have been more accurately titled "" Sexual exploits of a Cuban musician.I thought Pullitzer prize, Latin author, Going to be great. It has some good parts. The life of the emigre in New York, some perspective on Cuba, the times, the lot of the musician etc.The tying of the plot to an I love Lucy episode was good and worked well but the relentless odes to the main character's penis wore thin fairly fast. Sometimes the book felt like Penthouse lite or worse yet like the book Mr. Garrison from South Park wrote up in the hills.Really you start to wonder whether the guy is part man part horse. Want a good latin author, rather try Julia Alvarez.Oh and those of you reading this who are now tempted to buy the book for the sex and con your roommate you are reading literature. Forget it! The sex is clinical, dull, notch on a gun stuff."
3,"Interesting Read, with Flaws","While I enjoyed the writing and the story, and appreciated the atmosphere invoked both for the 1950s and the present day, there were two major flaws that hindered my total enjoyment of the book. Firstly, while I am far from a prude, I found that the constant, graphic explanations of sex and body parts borderd on the pornographic. The man had many lovers--I get it. I don't need to read gory descriptions for 500 pages. That brings up the other flaw--the book could have been cut by 100 pages. Those last pages told us nothing new, and were basically a rehash of Cesar's musings and rememberances. This made the book very draggy, and really diluted the emotional power for me."
4,Still good after a second read,"When I first read this book, I was blown away by the writing. Hijuelos is a master of description; the scents, sounds, and scenes are as vivid as any I have read. The portrayal of a simple man, Cesar, shows how complex we all really are.However, I must say after the second reading, I was somewhat turned off by the sex and I didn't like Cesar nearly as well. I'm not sure what made the difference (it was probably a year between readings). Still Hijuelos is a fantastic writer; I just like some of his other works better."
5,Awesome Stars,"Anyone can piece these fabulous stars with ease! Carol's paper-piecing techniques take the stress out of producing intricate-looking, stunning stars that are sure to please everyone. And if that isn't enough, the CD included in the book offers you a private lesson with the best paper-piecing teacher in the land. A super value for the price."
2,Not as good as her other books...,"I have read about half of Jude Deveraux's books now - she is the only romance author I have read and I love her complex and touching plots - but have to admit that this one just doesn't compete with the others. It was okay, but the story didn't click in various areas: romance was questionable, intricacies of the plot were sometimes confusing and inconsistent, and the end was downright perplexing. How can a lady marry a man who doesn't even look at her at the altar much less stand next to her??!!!"
4,One of her best.,"Jude is a fantasic author, all of her fans know it. This was one of her best, I must say. Not the typical book she writes, but had a little depth to it, some kind of a plot involved. Its not as good as some of the others, but not as bad either. You'll like it."
3,Guileless,"J. Geils Band was first a '70s band that skirted the Boston blues revival/hope and eagerness that the hopeful fake of which Areosmith made some success. J. Geils had foremost a nasty guitar player,(Mr. Geils),a groggy vocalist, Peter Wolf, and a growling harmonica Magic Dick. Nobody outside the East Coast paid much attention. LPs were recorded, boys LOVED the blues nasty yelp, the pitch perfect guitar of J. Geils, and everytime Magic Dick got a solo. J. Geils had a few Top 40 bottom feeder blues-based hits, ""Must of Got Lost"" a disco hit "" Give it to Me"" a punkish ""Love Stinks"" then hit stride with '80's mega-hits ""Centerfold"" and ""Freeze Frame"".This Best OF has radio hits and a few beloved LPs cuts like, ""Whammer Jammer"". It just doesn't re-create the true J Geils Band xperience of a 12 pack and pot shots at the world."
3,Short version,Why is Give It To Me the short version?People there is a long version out there but once again Rhino decides not to use it.It's like reading 1/2 a book.
1,If only I had seen the negative notices in the press,"After perusing my copy of the Encarte Dictionary for a day I gave it to my eleven year nephew. With this book, he now has an attractive, albeit expensive, awkward, and bulky dictionary, free of distracting scholarly etymologies, and rife with cool pictures, hip words, and ephemeral techno-jargon; just the ticket for a young impressionable mind. Needless to say, he was impressed by the size and visual appeal of the book. Fortunately, it takes a discerning intellect and some degree of language acumen to be able to appreciate the many shortcomings present in this reference. When he is ready for a real dictionary, I'll get him the Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary or the New World College Dictionary. I figure he's fixed for another year or two."
1,Politically correct version of the English language.,"This dictionary is a pathetic attempt to inflict an elitist, politically correct version of the English language on an unsuspecting public. If ""black"" is offensive, then why isn't ""white"" offensive? The same goes for ""negro"" and ""caucasion."" By the way, since we can no longer refer to people of African descent as ""black,"" what do we call the thousands of Europeans who happen to have African ancestors? African-Europeans?"
1,Only as a background Reference,"So rife with errors and trendy, dated definitions (read ""gay"") that it's only really fit for lexicographers. NOT recommended for anything other than a supplementary reference."
1,"Terrible, Just Plain Terrible","This is a terrible dictionary. Its hard to read, the art work is very poor, and it wasn't manufactured properly. World English? No, its basically American English dumbed down. They did a very poor job. If you'd like to own or read one of the best dictionaries order The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Third Edition."
1,Sub-par dictionary limboed beneath already low expectations.,"Anne Soukhanov is one of the world's greatest lexicographers, but even she couldn't have saved this ""World Dictionary"" project. As all users of MS Encarta Encyclopedia know, the content is quite flaky. It seems the bad traits of MSN have carried over to the dictionary."
3,"faded, offset pattern","this material is thin, you can see through it. also, it looks factory made with a repeating pattern. you could easily get the very top of ariel's face or the bottom with no real picture at all."
2,Too clever by half,"Please see review by C. Mialaret. S/he is spot on.One gets the impression that the author may have been more focused on impressing you with his eruditeness, rather than writing a practical book with useful examples and clear explanations.Affecianados of Kalen Delaney's 'Inside SQL Server 2000' will be disappointed."
1,Too Heavy Handed,"After fewer than a dozen pages, I dropped this one into my recycle container. I understand that the author was trying to set up the story of a woman building a new life after leaving an abusive husband, but there is such a thing as laying it on too thick. Any intelligent reader would have gotten the point after a page or two, but it goes on and on. For me, life's too short to wade through such material. (Isn't there already too much of this kind of thing in reality? Do we really need more of it? Seems some people do. After all, soap operas are still very popular.)"
2,Don't Let the Cover deceive you,"From looking at the DVD cover you would think that this performance is by Martha and the Vandellas from the 1960's time period. Wrong. Performed in Orlando in maybe 2005. Martha's voice is awful. Sounds like an old lady singing in church, over vibrato sounding. However, there are 4 tracks on the DVD featuring Sam Moore(from Sam&Dave fame)and he sounds terrific. So just when I thought I made a bad purchase,which I did, it was salvaged."
5,Awesome!,I love it! It really helped me learn kana! I can write my name ( better than before) also it is very cute and teaches me cool facts about Japan and how to say some stuff.
1,Not Worth the Money,All this book does is list the kana. There are thousands of websites on the internet that will provide the same service as this (along with practice games) for free. Just use Google.
3,A rip-off without Kristen Vigard's version of the theme song!,"How could they release this without Kristen Vigard's version of ""God Give me Strength""? Not to knock Elvis Costello's version, but Kristen Vigard's performance of this song is the heart and soul of the movie. This CD is a rip-off without it."
4,"Best version of ""God Give Me Strength"" not on CD!!!","Many thanks to the customer from LA who provided the name of Illeana Douglas' voice singing the song, ""God Give Me Strength"" - namely Kristen Vigard. I'm definitely going to try to find more by her! She has a great voice."
4,Fun!,"Every song makes you want to dance and sing along, although to be honest, I can do without the ""Jay"" songs. Boat on a Sea is empowering and beautiful. Loved the movie. Love the music!"
3,no itch,"I have braids that I had gotten done in jamaica. Bought this when I came back to Florida, it's been about 2 mOnths I've been using this product and I haven't had any itch or flakes. I just don't like the smell"
5,A Great Recording Remastered To Perfection!,"This CD was released approximately the same time as the four disc box set, but only in Europe. It covers the years of 1967 to 1979 with only the major hits. It's a nice greatest hits CD if you don't want to be bothered with the extraneous minor hits and album cuts of the Box Set. It was already well mixed at the first printing - but this remastered version is amazing!"
3,"GREAT ALBUM FROM MY ""JAMMING YEARS"".","AS I REMEMBER IT, THE OLD ""PLASTIC PLATE' HAD BETTER SOUND THAN THE DOWN LOADED VERSION THAT I BOUGHT. IT BRINGS BACK MEMORIES OF THE OLD TIMES ANY WAY."
2,Over recorded And lame video content,It's the same bad audio as the single cd . plus it has a video dvd with only a little bit of material on it.Don't waste your money on this one!!!!
4,Grand Funk Love Note,"Great compilation, by a great band from a different era. Stands up to the test of time, and a worthy add to the rotation."
5,"Impress Your Colleagues, Enthrall Your Students","The sample lesson plan at the front of the book is in outline form for the entire unit and connects across the curriculum. Connections to Vocabulary, Science, Math, Culture, Art, and Logical Thought Process are included. Provided are testing materials to determine the level of learning (answer keys are included.) I was looking forward to teaching this unit, but alas, I did not have the opportunity to teach this grade level, (other than student teaching.)With a scanner these lessons could easily be adapted to the computer."
5,Do NOT miss this book!,"Besides being a well written and in depth account of the tragic events in Rwanda, this book is a devastating analysis of todays geopolitical realities.Yet, this book is also a sign of hope. As long as the UN peacekeeping forces are staffed with men like Dallaire I see real prospect in the long run.This is the story of a hero - precisely because the author does not see himself as one.A rare treat nowadays."
5,this is so sad,"This book will have you reading into the night. You simply can't put this book down. The other thing you can't do, is understand the way the world acted - or rather did not act - in Rwanda. Dallaire's book is shocking and is probably going to make you question a lot of things about international politics. Dallaire is a tragic hero, a self described casulty of this genocide, and his book is a very important historical document. Don't miss the opportunity to read this, it is a life changer."
1,Junk,"Very cheaply made. ""Cushion"" grips were already coming off when I received it. Must be super cheap glue. Spend a little more and get wrenches that will last."
1,read the book!,This is a HORRIBLE series! Read the books by Terry Goodkind. They are a hundred percent better! This tv series is a waste of time and puts the books to shame. I'm so sad that a good book series is being destroyed like this.
4,Legend og the Seeker,"A good story line, somewhat different from the books. Still; true to the basic story line. Liked the books more than the tv series."
4,"Good, but uneven","Overall, I have enjoyed this programme. Although there were episodes that I simply did not like: Honestly, what was the point of Princess? And Creator had plot holes earthmovers could have driven through. I was disappointed with the poor use of Darken Rahl through most of the second season.Nevertheless, I was happy to receive my DVD.In case anyone has not yet grokked the news, the DVD made it clear that this was the second AND FINAL SEASON! The studio ought to have included a length of 2x4 with the DVD so viewers could club themselves over the head with that bit of information.It would have been nice to have had some episode commentaries on the DVD. The packaging is very pretty, but the producers could have done so much more with the content."
5,"Wonderful, interesting, compelling","Absolutely love the rich, creative storylines that build upon each other from week to week. These are fully developed, three-dimensional, likable characters woven into a story that is a feast for the imagination. This second season has its share of the unexpected that will keep you wondering what is going to happen next. Intelligent, believable and compelling, this is one of my favorite TV shows ever."
4,Great so far...,"I bought this on Amazon's ""Today's Deals"", so I got it for an incredibly low price. I absolutely love the watch. it's the perfect, classic diver's watch. Solid and comfortable. The only thing that troubles me is that I can actually hear the automatic winding mechanisms when I move the watch back and forth - I have other automatics and I can't hear a thing when they wind. So this is kind of scary - it's a metal-on-metal sound, not a nice smooth sound. Not a big deal as long as it doesn't portend something broken. We'll see. Fortunately, I believe the warranty is for one year, which is really great. Notwithstanding that, this watch looks and feels great, and seems to have really solid construction."
3,Everyday Watch,"For $100 makes a great everyday watch with nice looks. Far better styling than a Timex, etc. Slightly taller than I'd like, but for the price, no complaints."
4,Looks good but that's all,"I've bought this watch three weeks ago and use it everyday because it looks nice and sporty. But it's not good at keeping time, it tends to run faster, so I am a little disappointed. However, if you like diver style watches and don't mind a few seconds inaccuracy, go for it."
1,nice watch working problem,"Hi,unfortunately there is problem with this item. The time does not correct. It lost about 4-5 min per week. Is there something that i could do?"
2,Enough to convince me to get a real one,"This is a cheesy piece with really bad engineering and instructions. Once put together can actually be used for a project, but its principal value for me was to convince me to get a real router table. The table is OK, the switch is OK, the table extensions are cheesy but the fence is the real piece of garbage. Its two pieces, each too short and too hard to keep from moving while running wood through the router.I'd give it one star but it did actually make it easier to chamfer the edges of all the wood in the shutters I was making for my house - most but not all of them even. The goobers were mainly due to the lousy fence which I was ultimately able to work around.OK, it was cheap but I definitely did NOT get more than I paid for."
5,Outstanding,Bobgoblin succeeds in creating some of the most brilliant rock 'n roll in recent years. Bobgoblin ignores traditional rock songwriting patterns and keeps the songs interesting. I highly recommend.
3,Good effort.Fair book,"This book is for beginners,the tex is very good ,the cdrepeat what's in the book,but don't expect to learn everything you need to know about candlestick from this book.This is just a starter.Fair book."
4,Charlie Parker has Another Adventure,Connie Shelton's Charlie Parker after solving a murder back home in Albuquerque heads off to Hawaii for a relaxing vacation. Well her plans were to have a relaxing vacation until taking a helicopter sightseeing tour while flying over a area that the helicopter do not normally fly over see what appears to be a dead body lying in the rocky cliffs and Charlie being Charlie is not satisfied to notify the local authorities and go about her merry way on the vacation. No she has to stick her nose into this dead body when she becomes romantically involved with one of the helicopter pilots who's boss and company owner is charged with the murder. I loved Charlie getting cozy with someone there were some Loving and almost sexy scenes. There are a good half dozen suspects in this tale I could not guess the murderer and i am betting you can't either. Download. Purchase or borrow this book but read it
1,Way Too Repetitive!,"As a lover of all kinds of music I have a small collection of some excellent percussion and Native American music. I was excited when I saw this CD in the store and upon purchasing it I proceeded to listen to it on the way home. While I can appreciate the rythym and the chanting/singing, I have never owned a CD that has less variety from song to song. I would swear they performed one LONG song and then cut it into pieces for the CD. NO KIDDING, the cadence, rythym and vocal variation are identical on every song! Don't waste your money!"
4,Absurd and Daring and Courageous,"Chester Himes is a truly remarkable and amazing writer who has largely been forgotten by the reading public. Along with 'The Quality of Hurt,' the first part of Himes' two volume memoir, no where in American letters has a writer so captured the life of an expatriate American artist then Mr. Himes. From his days serving prison time and learning to write, to his final days in Spain where finally he was able to live as the artist he wished to be, this story is as amazing and 'American' as any yet produced in some 300 odd years of our country's literature.On a personal note, I first read this book while living in New York City as a very poor young man myself. It made me laugh on cold nights, at, yes, the absurdity of it all, and I recommend it to anyone who has dared the Gods and tried to make a living by his pen or laptop."
1,Skip It,"Pretentious, boring crap. Here and there an insightful characterization or anecdote will get your hopes up, but for the most part this book is a ""Look at me, I'm so rich, my wife looks great in her underpants, we are super"" vanity project that made me cranky. I read this book over a year ago and I'm still mad I bought it. There are so many horse books out there that are worth reading: Horse Heaven by Jane Smiley is an excellent place to start. Don't bother with this one, unless you're One of Them."
1,"Borrow, don't buy, this book","After starting a book, I try to give it a chance. After 200 pages, I gave this one away to a thrift store. Korda's elitist attitude (even in light of his down-home, conversationalist style of writing) as well as some glaring inaccuracies about horses put me off.I wonder what his past friends and acquaintances thought about his outright gossip about their personal homelife? I was appalled by his racist comments about stable employees, as well as his puffed-up attitude about himself."
2,Over the Top,"I agree with the reviewer who said not to recommend this book to foxhunters -- the picture he presents is archaic, racist, and is more suited to his native England, I guess. If so, no wonder they banned it. I foxhunt in Kentucky, and the picture he paints is totally off-base. We are a group of normal people who happen to like to spend our money and time on horses, not golf. We revel in the chase, not the kill -- we have not killed a fox in over 20 years. We have Jewish and black members. I take care of my own horses and open my gates myself. This book sets the sport back 50 years. My copy is now in the trash."
4,tremendous figurative language and imagery!,"This book is an engaging tale about the too-late, but finally developing, relationship between a mother and daughter. This is the first book I have ready by Anna Qunidlin, and I plan to read many more. Her writing is extremely figurative and she utilizes the most beautiful metaphors I've come across in a long while. This story is beautifully written and reads very smoothly. The story is one that grips you in from start to finish and you'll find yourself never wanting to put it down!"
5,The Best Book For Hip Cocktails At Home,"Since we live in the author's hometown, we first encountered this book while sipping terrific innovative cocktails at her restaurant Mint. We bought a signed copy of the book at that time, but somehow between the great cocktails at Mint, and more libations at a local music bar, I misplaced the book and had to buy another on Amazon.This is a great small book to make incredibly, unique drinks that make for a great hit at parties. Whip up a few of the following for guests and see their reactions:The Moscow MuleThe 816The CableThe Mirror BallThe Sweet LoveBe forwarned, you will need to shop and stock for the ingredients, as most of us don't keep a lot of simple syrup, guava puree, Crater Lake vodka, and other interesting stuff in the liquor cabinet. But the book walks you through all the basics; what to buy, and the techniques you need to know, including how to muddle, and even ice basics. It is also a very pretty book, with great illustrations and photos."
5,The head of the nail has been struck!,"As a brief patient of Dr. Hsi's and a memeber of the healthcare industry for 25 years, this book struck at the core of my very being. I not only see what he experienced everyday in my line of work but also expierienced it on a different level for myself. Anyone thinking of pursueing a career in medicine, should let this book open your eyes and your heart. It would make sense to have this be required reading for every nurse, pre-med student, intern, resident or seasoned physician. I know with some it would fall on deaf ears, however if it only made a difference in a few, what a difference it could make in so many lives.Many thanks to Beth Corbin-Hsi, Jim Belshaw and of course Steven D. Hsi, M.D who gives us wisdom and courage through his words even now."
5,Closing the Chart,"I received this book three days ago and could not put it down. I knew when the work week ended, I could finish this compelling,eye-opening story of a man's most personal thoughts and heart-wrenching feelings for his family, his disease and his God. Every doctor in the country should read this book and ask if they see themselves in it."
3,Useful,"It's not too impressive. The print type is small, and needs to be reset, because many of the pages are not printed evenly, some have hardly any ink on them. I sent for a replacement, thinking my copy was just defective, but the replacement had worse printing quality than the original they sent me. The paper is good quality, and I like the Lexicon and Synonyms at the back. I got it for $17, and it is worth the price, but I would only use it for reference and not for daily study. If the print quality was better, and the font a bit larger, I would have given it a higher rating."
2,Horrible binding splits,"I bought the paperback edition, 0-8010-0700-3, two years ago. As other reviewers have mentioned, the printing quality is often poor. There is a more serious problem massive binding splits. The binding has split around pages 130, 134, and 346. The tears are massive, in the first two cases with half the binding torn off, leaving the book in two pieces, held together only by the part of the binding is still attached.This is a useful bible, with several excellent study aides. It is unfortunate that the binding and print are poor."
2,Wrong Book,I had wanted the book similar to this one where it has the reference in order. This one is not useful to me so i wasted the $
4,Greatly Under Appreciated,"Rahsaan Patterson is truly meant for the ""poetry joint"",""coffee shop clique"", and/or the ""smooth groove/midnight love"" type of listener. The song ""Spent The Night"" is almost designed to be played with candlelight, scented oils,incense and the right person! For the sadder side of love which almost always has a soundtrack, the songs ""Tears Ago"" and ""Stay"" are the perfect backdrop for the listener who has hurt so much they can't hurt anymore and the love that you wish you you could go back in time and right the wrongs. The rest of the album does not hold up to the same standards set by the aforementioned tracks but ""Rahsaan Patterson"" is a album sure to compliment your mood for love."
4,Don't sleep on this album,"Rashaan Patterson self titled album has got to be one of the best kept secrets in ther Neo R-n-B category. here there are nbo covers just good songs sung bya good singer. Some of my favorites are Spend the night, so fine and my sweet heart. Definetly an album that a lot of people will sleep on. It definetly is worth the purchase."
3,"o.k., expected more","keak the sneak has a good track on this--""get u lit"", and messy marv comes hard on the 12th track--but jt, despite some good verses (as usual, he's been layin this for years) is pretty mediocre. These songs would be so much better without cheesy hooks--just straight spit the lines, [forget] a hook! check out jt and the glp ""the package"" for something you will keep rewinding--jt has some hard stuff on there.."
3,OK I guess,"I got this looking for a grip tape that is lighter than most, which it is. However, it only sticks to itself and not the stick so it tends to slide around. It slid right off the end of the stick when my friend was playing but he hits quite hard."
4,The Wild Orchids of California,"Excellent photos and descriptions of our lovely native terrestrial orchids, many of which grow into Oregon and Washington. I purchased this book a few years ago from Hamilton Books at a substantial discount of around $6."
2,Disappointingly short,"The product description didn't specify how long the tug rope is, but I was assuming it'd be more than 3 feet long. Wrong! I found that to be uncomfortably short for my hyper lab puppy. He's still learning his manners, and sometimes when excited playing tug of war he'll quickly let go and grab on again further up the rope to get a better grip and with this toy my hand was uncomfortably close to his sharp puppy teeth!I say stay away from this and get a longer tug toy unless you have a dog that is an experienced tugger and will reliably grab on to only the very end of a rope even when excited."
4,Hold onto your tips,These headphones sound great and once you pick the proper size ear tips fit great too! The big downside of these is that the ear tips loosen easily when taken off and get lost easily. My solution is to dab a drop of Krazy Glue on each ear tip and those suckers stay put.
2,I thought I would get a lot more than what they delivered,"Bose is a name that is associated with sound quality, but this headset leaves much to be desired. I, like many others I'm sure bought these just on the strength of the Bose name and have come to realize that that is not a good enough reason to purchase this head set.CONS1. The fit of the silicone buds is ergonomically awful! It does not matter which size you use small, Med. or Large they all are uncomfortable.2. The fact that the input jack on these headsets is not L shape is annoying from a design point of view.3. The cost: For what you are getting or I should say NOT getting, they are a bit PRICEYPROS.1. The actual sound comming out of them is very good.2. The leather carrying case is cuteAll and all I am dissapointed in Bose and would advise you to get a different headset."
2,Great while they last....,"These headphones sound 100 times better than the standard Ipod headphones. However, and this is a BIG HOWEVER, they cost $[...] and didn't last more than 1 year. I used these everyday at work and at the gym and then one day this week, they just stopped working? Now in order to listen to them I have to hold the headset plug in the ipod without fully plugging it in, in order to get any decent sound! Obviosuly I can't sit here and hold the Ipod at an angle in order for the headphones to work.Do yourself a favor and go with another brand that isn't almost as much money as the Ipod itself! Believe me, in a year you'd be glad you did."
4,spinalfusion,"I know some people don't like these earphone, and they are expensive. But, I've been pretty pleased with them. They have excellent sound quality and they stay in your ears fine if you're not moving around too much. If you're big on exercising with your earphones, you might have some trouble but not any more than with the standard iPod earphones. Actually, I think they fit better than the standard iPod earphones."
2,Bose In-Ear,The Neoprene ear buds continue to be a problem of coming off if you are not careful. Not sure the sound quality is worth the premium cost.
3,"A pain, i would like my money back PLEASE","loved it at first. It seamed to be very comfy.. here's the bad thing about this product.The rubber caps on the ear piece keeps falling off just like the foam from the ipod headphones although it came with three different sets. large, midum, and small,.only the small could fit for me. and then.. to make a long story short one fell off.. and on like the ipod headphones you can getaway without the foam you cant with the boseso bottom line iwould love to get my money backmaybe i should have glued them on"
2,bose put their name on this crap?,"I admit I am a brainwashed Bose fan and love their products. i got a $25 gift certificate for best buy and I bought these for around $80 out of pocket. These things suck. yes, the sound is decent, but comparable to less expensive sony earbuds that are half the price. the cord is cheap plastic that stays in permanent shape as it came from the factory. it looks and feels sad. the sound isolation and fitment of the silicone ear pieces stinks. do not attempt to jog or exercise in these things. all you'll hear is the wind rushing in and the earbuds themselves trying to extract themselves from your ear and onto the floor. I returned these headphones in 3 days."
2,bose sound this bad?,"I have wanted a pair of Bose earphones for a while, and finally took the plunge. I was very disappointed w/ the sound, i have a 10 dollar pair of panasonic that sound better. I am extremely picky about headphone/earbud sound, I've tryed at least a dozen differnt makes styles, including Creative EP-510 , Panasonic rp hv21, Altec Lansing AHP2, Creative EP-630, the stock itouch set, and these Bose are among the worst ive tried. I dont mind spending some money if its what i want, but its so hard to try a set of headphones then return them if you dont like them, who wants to put them on after someone else has used them? so now I'm out 60 bucks, glad i bought them thru amazon and didnt lose more $$$."
2,Half good / Half bad,"I have to say, that I enjoy the sound that is produced by these little buds. Yes there is much bass to the sounds, but that is something that I particularly enjoy, especially given the fact that most earbuds produce little to no bass. However, does that eqaute to a good product given the fact the buds CONSTANTLY slide out of my ear. I spend about 40 minutes commuting to work, between subways & walking, I I probably adjust the buds about 20 times. That is very annoying, and doesn't justify the price tag. I wish there was a way to have tested them out before purchase, but there wasn't any ""test"" products, and I don't know if I would have put them in my ears anyways. If you plan on being sedatary with them, by all means, it's a good pair to have, as I've figured out the proper placment where they don't really fall out. Back to trying to find a new pair!"
3,Don't Waste Your Money,"I purchased the IE ear buds as a replacement for the the ones suplied with my Sansa e260. It's not that the OEM ear buds delivered lousy sound, it's just that they could do better and were uncomfortable to wear for extended periods. Inconsistant recording quality between ripped CDs also caused some recordings to sound flat. The Bose ear buds did nothing to inprove sound quality. As a matter of fact they seem to allow more ambient sound into you ear and delivered a more muted fidelity than the OEM ear buds. They are a bit more comfortable, but the loss of sound quality doesn't make up for the difference. If you have a Sansa and are considering upgrading your ear buds, do not use Bose. What you have already is a better quality product."
1,Read this before you buy,"Bose engineers could not have spent much time on research and development with these buds. Poor outdoor listening qualities, cheap cord, and will not stay in my ears when I am jogging. You can do much better spending $15 on a cheap pair, rather than wasting $100 of your hard earned money on these."
2,not loud enough,"Good sound quality, better than the apple earbuds, but the volume is much lower and for this price it's unacceptable. No I'm not deaf and no I don't need to clean my ears out, when using on the street, on the train etc., you can barely hear anything without the volume being at it's highest. This was a christmas gift from my wife but it's going back."
3,Not that great,"These headphones do have good bass, but are lacking in treble and sound muffled. I think the factory Apple headphones that come with the iPods now have a much clearer and better overall sound. And Bose wants $100 for these...not worth it."
3,A Helpful Supplement,"This Glannon book is not as fabulous as his Civil Procedure Examples and Explanations. Nonetheless, it is a good purchase. I found it neccessary to also purchase a commercial outline. The best sections in this book are those on intentional torts and affirmative defenses to them. The chapters on proximate causation and the ""zone of danger"" put into focus many concepts that a commercial outline or class discussion alone cannot. I also found the chapter on writing a good torts exam to be quite useful. Overall, a worthwhile purchase."
3,Not happy with a newer computer,"We had to bust an older PC out of storage to get this game to run without crashing. It just doesn't seem to like newer hardware, however OS seemed to make no difference. We tried it on 3 different computers before we gave in and got out the old one. It loads, it starts, it gets a few minutes in to the game, then it goes down on all the new machines we tried it on. As long as you are running a system about 4 years old or more, you should be fine (which really means most PC's that younger kids are allowed to use will work). Once you get it working, it's a great game, my kids even play it for fun. We hooked the old PC up to our TV, so all 3 of our younger kids can watch each other play, and the competition inspires them to pay more attention to how problems are solved. It's good for logical thinking as well as math. Worth the cost, for sure."
2,Cover damaged,When I received my product the back cover it was damaged and looks as used item insted as new how is suppost to.
2,Worst One Yet,I feel like each time Michael Flatley redoes a show it gets worse and worse and this one has proved the worst. He made it too much about himself. The new scenery was a little too much for a dancing show. It felt more like a heavy metal concert. The only good part is that Michael Flatley didn't take off his shirt....for once.
4,Good Concert,"A good concert but not nearly as good as the 1998 Hyde Park, London concert.I must have misunderstood the description. I expected a different concert from Hyde Park.This was simply the same concert done on a much smaller, cheaper scale. I thought Flatley, being a great choreographer, could have done something new. I reckon he put this on to satisfy the fans that wanted to see Feet of Flames on stage. That is all very well. However, I feel it should not have been released as a DVD.I ended up giving it away to my daughter. I will watch the original."
1,NOT Feet of Flames,"What I wanted was a Blu-Ray copy of Feet of Flames. What I found was a new cut of several Lord of the Dance performances. Its just not the same. Michael is of course awesome, but Feet of Flames was realy the definitive production. Sad Face !"
1,I got a broken product and have to pay to send it back.,"I got a broken product and have to pay to send it back. Sounds good, right?I must not purchase any products like that in here again, your service is so bad."
1,he got sick,"my 2 month old baby develop a severe gastric reflux due to the tablets, he need medications and a doctor visit."
1,Terrible grammar and word choice!,"I run an after-school theater program for middle school students, and I ordered this book because the other monologue books I had didn't seem relevant or age-appropriate for the children. I was seriously displeased when it arrived, though; the monologues are too badly written to be usable, even for my middle schoolers. People don't choose words they way these monologues are written. They're badly scripted and terribly edited; I struggled to find even a couple that didn't contain grammatical or spelling errors."
1,garbage,"Did a whole lot of nothing, except make it worse. I also noticed the teeth on the bits broke off."
2,its a no go!!!!,i just go my screw remover. i was trying to replace some truck anchors on my Chevy truck. the screw that were in the anchors were rusted and stripped. i hooked up the the proper size for the screw and all that happened was the thread on the top of the screw was getting drilled out. pieces of the inside of the screw where coming out. when i stopped the bit and screw started to smoke. it didn't work for me. i had to go to lowes and buy a drill bit set and drill the screw out....
1,Beware--Sony has a problem with bad hard drives,"I've seriously regretted not ponying up the extra cash for an IBM or Apple. I was sold on the great screen, but have had problems ever since.A warranty is getting me a new hard drive, and the customer service person I spoke to said that Sony has had major issues with faulty hard drives.The Sony software that they load on top of the operating system slows it down and cuts your space. It also conflicts with Microsoft updates. This caused problems with my audio and other drivers. Sadly, standard warranties do not cover the operating system (they consider that software), and getting these problems fixed has been a headache and an unwelcome bill.Speaking of audio, the speakers are so low that you can't use this computer to play music or a DVD, unless you're right up at the screen or have the headphones in."
2,Super cute! But cheap,My and my daughter were extremely happy when these boots arrived. My daughter wore them for about 2 weeks before she came home and the boot had a big slice down the side. It just tore! It was not fixable so they ended up in the garbage. I paid to much money for a really cheap product. My daughter is 5 and has been wearing rain boots since she was 2 and we have never had this happen before. Needless to say we were and still are very disappointed!!!
5,The Beauty of Physics!,"This rack is holding up my two bikes perfectly well in my apartment hallway. Built well so it was easy to get the pole snug between the ceiling and floor. The reviewers that complain about this pole being ""wobbly"" are either a) not installing this correctly, or b) expecting this rack to be akin to a dancer's pole."
4,Arnster1234,"I was very satisfied with this product. Perhaps the best thing about it is that it is so EASY to set up. If you are like me, you get that sinking feeling when you order a product, take it out of the box and realize that putting it together is going to be a major fiasco. No so with this product. ANYONE can take this out of it's box, set it up and put two bikes on it within a couple on minutes. The manufacturer of this product understands the KISS Theory: Keep it simple, stupid!"
1,out of sync video and audio on Season 2 Disc (outsourcing),Havent had a chance to watch all the episodes but the season 2 disc on outsourcing has video/audio sync issues. Amazon sent me a replacement set and the problem was still present. Season 1 discs were fine.
3,Average Phone,"I have been using this phone for a year now. Here's a list of things that i like/unlikePros -Nice battery life(after i had to chage a setting to improve it).Battery gets fuly charged in now time. around 40-45 min.Camera quality is good.Call quality is good, easy to sync up with most of the bluetooth headsets.Cons -Phone heats up a little bit and gets warm if you talk for long time.Just after 9-10 months of usage, it hangs sometimes (not much though, once every couple of weeks)."
3,Almost all you need,"Likes:-WMA Player, all my files are in WMA format, now i truly have a music player-FM Radio, for the times i dont want to listen to music-Camera provides the best picture out there for a phone-Big phone, i dont like small ones with small buttons-No need to carry a mp3/ipodDislikes:-Voice activated dialing is HORRIBLE. my old motoKRZR worked perfect-Extremely low battery time, someone please figure this out, i charge my phone at night and at 4pm everyday-Slow startup timeOVERALL: Buy this phone if you're like me and like bigger phones with great music/media access. Buy the SOny Erricson W18i if you want a smaller phone with nearly the same function. Or wait for the iphone June 29th.-The cingular/ATT Service is not as good as Verizon my old provider in the northwest"
2,Not satisfied with this phone,"Pro: many functions.con: when I inserted the Sd card into the slot under the direction (I did it very well at the first time). It was stuck in the aperture and spent a lot of time to take it out! Bad battery, I need to charge the cell every two or less days! Easily press the connection bottom accidently (Which charges me money); Cannot see the some rm form videos(can hear it)."
1,"Very bad phone, stay away from it","This is the worst phone I've ever used.1. It loses calls. A lot of important calls came in but it did not ring or show missed calls.2. The flip portion of the telephone cracked after 1 month. Amazon won't replace it because it was right after 30 days. Nokia will not fix it for hardware problem. Now, after 3 months of normal use, the display is coming off as well.3. The phone turns itself off randomly. I have become so paranoid now and have to check the status of phone very frequently.4. If you still decide to buy one, prepare 3 chargers. One in the office, one at home and a car charger. The battery will not last for even one day."
1,Very poor battery life,Two things about this cell phone that made me decide to go back to my old phone: (1) It gets hot after a short phone conversation; (2) The battery only lasts two days even when I don't make any phone calls. It is even worse than my old cell phone which I have used for two years.I am very disappointed with this phone and trying to return it.
2,My purchase of the nightmare phone,"This phone leaves much to be desired. However, Amazon.com initiated a replacement for me when my carrier refused becase I didn't buy it from them. The replacemtent is better but not by much. Nokia has some work to do on this model."
2,Beware: Manufacture doesn't cover cracking @ joint!,"I thought this was a wonderful phone until it cracked between the joint and the bottom end of the screen. So I called the manufacture and they said that they don't cover cracking at the joint and now my warranty is void. So if you decide to buy this phone and you talk a lot on it, know that this will also happen to you. BTW I have had the phone for 10 months when this happened."
4,Nice Phone,Pros:Really cool phone.

Response sometimes a but sluggish.had some issues with real player files not workingagain as i said battery is not great... dont xpect 3 days widout charging...
1,still listen to this kind of music nowdays ?,"malmsteen is great in skill but in song writing?, uhhis kind of music is dead nowno one wants to listen anymore"
4,Concise but quality review!,"Concise but quality review! A good first step in reading about vascular, especially if you don't have enough time to read Rutherford!"
3,Weird,"After seeing the beginning of this DVD, I knew that it wouldn't work for my music students. The ugly, caricatured faces of the people would scare little children. Once the story actually begins, it might work for middle grades, except that the duck is portrayed as a drunk. Some adults or teenagers might find the reenactment comical and interesting. Some middle grades kids might like it, while others would just think it was weird. The ""triumphant procession"" at the end is portrayed as a circus. After Peter and the Wolf, there is an epilogue featuring Overture on Hebrew Themes, in which the grandfather imagines his relatives and they are seen playing instruments and dancing. Last is 'The Classical Symphony' (subtitled ""Peter's Discovery""), which has more ugly caricatures. It turns into a food fight! After that, the relatives are dancing with the white wigged guys from the classical symphony."
4,Periodic Table,"This was a pretty good periodic table. It makes good use of color to make certain properties (phase at room temp., family etc.) available at a glance. The atomic numbers and masses could've been printed a bit larger. The electron configuration for the ground state of each element is given, which is useful for beginners; and the names of the elements are given in English (British), French and German, which is interesting (except the English for Iodine is given as Jodine, the only typo I've found so far)."
4,Liked it,"I liked getting to see the back story of Sam Axe before he became friends with Michael. Typical of Sam, it had comedy and action. A fun movie"
3,Fair to middlin': Fall of Sam Axe dullish,"Too bad this back story for Sam Axe, the charming sidekick of Michael Weston and quasi-adversary of Fiona, is not as sharp as the character. Sam's 'stopover' in Bogata, Columbia, should be cracker-jack given the location and premise, but it's dull-ish. Somehow, the storyline and series style isn't meshing. The pseudo- documentary about the 'fall of Jeffrey Donovan', the star of the Burn Notice series, and director of this two-episode sidebar to the series, was more compelling. Too bad. 2 1/2 stars.A. S. Jones, Toronto, Canada"
4,Great book on Prayer!,i am so glad my Seminary instructor chose this as one of our text books! I truly enjoyed this journey of prayer!
4,heartfelt & enlightening,So well written and a real appreciation of the purpose & pertinence of prayer; opened my eyes and heart to new thoughts and experiences of prayer as well as helping me with my own extant practice. A must read.
3,Currently using as text book for Math 530,"We are currently using this text in a graduate course in Mathematics & Modeling. We are completing the first chapter in Modeling Change. Some of the definitions are vague. The examples are good; although, I would like to have seen more. Exercises are good--prehaps add more ""warm-up"" exercises. The sidebar items relating to the corresponding use of the TI-89 is good, but the cooresponding variables between this and the text is confusing to some degree."
2,Not getting bang for ur buck with this book,"I bought this book and then returned it. I found it way too brief and simplistic, not offering details and explanations to concepts I was already familiar with. Frankly, for the price you could get much more instruction on personal finance with other books (i especially like Clark Howard's)."
3,needs a CD,"The Gaussian distribution is the heart of statistics. Small wonder, then, that over the years, many probability distributions have emerged in the literature, where these involve underlying random variables with Gaussian distributions.One problem is that often these higher level distributions cannot be expressed analytically. Just like the problem with a basic Gaussian. So often, the distributions must be expressed in tabular form, as given by the book. In related wise, the book usefully furnishes graphs that let you understand distributions more readily.All this is good. But the numerical nature of much of the book would lend itself more conveniently to it being presented in a CD. These days, when a reader is confronted with a table of values in a book, is she expected to type these in by hand into her computer?"
5,I miss you Joy!,I went to high school at VCH with Joy. My best memories are of Joy singing during chapel. Not only is she beautiful and a great surfer ( along with Anthony daddario) her voice gives me chills when she sings. It's great to see such a strong woman making a statement on the Christian and Pop music scene.
2,I'm disappointed,"The director states that he had well over 100 hours of footage to work with. For such an exhausting recording project, this is a paltry product.What we end up with in this documentary is a very sad and pathetic Arthur Kane, broke, alone and working at the Mormon library (having been SAVED by them, he is so lost and zombie-like at the end, that he really has no other place to go). He is shown retrieving his guitar from a pawn shop (where they bilked him into keeping it on loan) so that he could play the Dolls' final gig together in 2004.We see Barbara Kane only once, maybe twice, hardly anything from Sylvain and David Jo, little from other musicians around at the time, and only snippets of commentary by people like Iggy Pop. Morrissey is given the most time, with a 15 minute extra interview.I'm sure there is much more to Arthur Kane's life than is presented here. To include so little from the wife was just ignorant."
5,Play it over and over!,"I was familiar with the group's legendary hits, which got me to their live performance - which totally transformed me into a fan. The group played an amazing two hour set, which got me to buy this new release. I have really enjoyed this album...I'm still not tired of listening to it over and over. The energy and personality of this band has got to be seen to be believed. This CD is a winner!"
3,Good value for the price but has another design flaw,"I got this iron as a Christmas gift 4 years ago. It worked like a charm for all this time until all of a sudden the power stopped. The swivel ball cord attachment which seemed like a nice feature has a design flaw - once it gets out of whack, that's it. There is no way to open the iron to check the connections, as the iron uses security screws that require special tools to open. So basically it went from great to trash from one day to the next, there wasn't even a warning that anything is wrong with the cord, it just stopped working. I know it's that for sure, because when I plug in and forcefully swivel the ball and push on it the power comes on momentarily.Now I wonder if I want to experiment with another model, or do I just purchase the same unit?"
5,A man's iron,"My husband chose this to replace our old one, and once he learned all the features, is finding it does a great job on his golf shirts and makes short work of the job."
5,Black&decker iron,I looked through all the stores and could not find this iron anywhere. My wife bought a Rowenta to get her by but did not like it. This iron is of superior quality and works very well. The price was good and delivery time was very good.
1,Can't get it to heat up on first try,"When I plug it in, the display comes on and & adjust the heat setting to what I want & I wait... and wait... and wait... nothing happens other than the display flashing the name of the heat setting. I unplug, plug back in & sometimes I wait & wait again, sometimes it heats up quickly. I thought that shaking it around to the extent of mimicking motions of ironing would help since it has an auto-off function and movement might bring it to life, which it did once or twice, but now I think the auto-off mechanism is just always engaged and the thing refuses to heat up. I didn't come to this conclusion until it was past the return period so now I'm stuck with a broken iron that I barely got any use out of, maybe 5 times."
4,Very Satisfied,"I purchased this iron based on a CR review and ratings. The iron arrived in good shape, but the spray feature did not work. I called B&D; about it and they wanted me to cut the plug off of the cord and send it back to them at MY cost! Not happening...I got in touch w/Amazon and they promptly shipped me another one that works perfectly.It heats up rapidly and I really like the digital output."
2,Disappointed with Black and Decker D2030,"I have not decided whether to keep or return my new Black and Decker steam iron model D2030. Is the iron now being shipped actually the same as the one reviewed so glowingly by Consumer Reports? I note that mine was made in China. (Was the original?) The iron spits on the steam settings, and requires frequent refilling -- probably because so much water is wasted via spitting. It is very difficult to view the water level because the plastic jacket is almost opaque. Also, the sole plate is crudely attached; this looks as if it would present a problem when ironing delicate fabrics. On balance, definitely not an iron that I would recommend."
4,Not bad at all,The most recognizable feature is the weight. It is very heavy so you don't need to stretch your muscles to iron. A very important feature for those who iron 30 Shirts and 30 pants on one day every month.
5,The Best Iron I've ever used!,I bought this for my wife for Mother's Day and hands down this is the best iron I have ever used. The steam that it produces allows you to get every wrinkle out of every article of clothing. I tried it on a pair of jeans and the seams flattened out like I have never seen before. With my old iron the seams would never lay flat like this iron does. I have no problem recommending this iron!
2,irons great but doesn't last,"I love the way this iron peformed. Never had a problem with it burning up or dripping. However, they just don't last. The first one lasted a year; I thought it was a fluke so I bought a second one. It lasted for only 18 months. I give it a 5 for performance, but a 1 for durability."
5,Best Iron I've Ever Had,"I recently purchased the Black & Decker D2030 Auto-Off Digital Advantage Iron. It was actually a Consumer Report Best Buy and it has lived up to their recommendation. The iron heats up very quickly and does such a nice job. My cotton clothes now look like they've come from the cleaners. I also purchased it from Amazon with no shipping costs and saved $10.00 over all other merchants, even Wal-Mart. A great value for my money."
5,Best iron I've used,"I have used many irons over the years. As a member of the military I frequently have to iron uniforms and have gone through many different irons having been frustrated by most. This is the best one I've owned. It is powerful, heats up quickly, holds a good amount of water without leaking, and is solidly constructed. It has been dropped many times but the plastic has not cracked (many irons crack at the point or on the base when dropped). It produces a good amount of steam. When turned all the way up (to three steam clouds on the dial) it goes through the water fairly quickly. But at the lowest steam setting it still produces ample steam. The sprayer is also accurate and does not leak at the tip. Finally, the cord is LONG and a durable rubber that does not kink. All in all this is the best iron I have ever owned. I have had this iron now for at least five years without a single problem."
2,did not stay hot out the box,"Bad luck or this is the way irons ""tend"" to work? I've owned this model (2030) for two years. My new present iron stopped working after 9 - 12 months. This new iron (2030 also) along with my previous irons (Rowenta, B&D,T-Fall) have the same problem ... not staying hot during the ironing cycle. Product return was somewhat painless but I'm out the $9 dollars return shipping. An appliance repair person once told me that heat and electronics don't mix, but this is the 21st century."
5,The best steam iron ever,"This steam iron does not have a Rowenta in its name but let me tell you: it delivers as well, if not better at a fraction of a Rowenta cost. I like everything about it. It holds a lot of water, weighs sufficiently to even out the worst wrinkles. It trully works as a high-end professional stem iron."
5,Fantastically great iron,"If irons can be fantastic, this one is. It heats up fast, irons nicely, and turns off fast or by itself. This is the best one I've ever had."
4,Excellent Product,It arrived and it was rather user friendly right out of the box. Everything about this Iron is great. I do have a con after a weeks usage:- My GF complains that the iron is rather heavy(This Iron would be the best iron if it was lighter and had an automatic roll-up of the cord)Its def a steal of a deal....
5,Fantastic Iron,"This is a seriously fantastic iron. I never would have thought that an iron could push out that much steam with a press of a button! The Black & Decker Iron heats up quickly, glides over fabric smoothly, and shoots out the right amount of steam without leaking all over my husband's shirts. Highly recommended!!!"
4,great iron,I am very pleased with this iron. Steam is great and it does not spit water. Love it! I would definitely recommend.
3,OK iron,"I have owned this iron for over a year. It is adequate, and has been equal to any other iron I have owned, but I am not overly impressed with it. The digital readout looks neat, but it doesn't add much value to the iron. It no longer seems to get as hot as it used to when I first purchased it, and the dial to choose the level of steam no longer works. (It is stuck.)"
3,Will get the job done.,This iron will get the job done. Arrived quickly in great condition. Now water leaks from the front and the iron will just turn off in the middle of using it.
4,good,"i purchase this iron to replace my old broken iron. i dont like too many buttons for it gets me all confuse. however, it does its job good."
2,Loved it until it died a premature death,"While this iron worked, it was incredible. Problem is, it only lasted about 6 months. One day it started beeping, overheated, and then quit cold turkey, never to restart. A short, sweet life, but I don't think an iron should be a constantly replaceable item. I haven't had time to contact Black and Decker yet, but I'm not happy about the short life span of this product."
5,Just as good as Rowenta,"I looked up irons on consumer reports. It rates it above Rowenta. Considering the price, it's also a wise choice. We use the iron every day. Seems to work great. I love the digital features. It's push button instead of a dial. I would recommend it to anyone."
5,I like to iron now,My old cheap iron died and so I looked around to find something better. I just discovered why ironing was so difficult before. It was a underpowered iron. This one is excellent
1,Undependable workmanship,"My first Digital Advantage iron was a D2020, and I loved it for one year, then it let out a long audible beep and stopped heating. Couldn't have it repaired, so ordered a D2030, and was so excited when it arrived. I was able to iron two garments before it let out the long audible beep. Darn! I unplugged and replugged and tried again several times, and finally decided to hang it up and send it back. Double darn. Now back to square one and will have to make do with the old ordinary iron. Wish Black and Decker could improve the quality of this iron so I could have one again. Love the way it steam irons. Hate the way it breaks down."
1,Defective/Not working,"At first, it seems like it is working, but when I changed the settings to different levels I heard a very long beep and all the words was displayed at the same time on the screen and the beep did not shut off until I unplug the cord. Also, the levels like ""cotton & etc"" just keep on blinking and did display the word ""Ready"" that suppose to display on the screen when the iron reaches its temperature to that level or settings, plus the bottom of the iron drips plenty of water. I never have a chance to use this iron at all and returned it rightaway!"
3,mine died,"I loved my iron until it died, only 5 months after I bought it. Black and Decker is honoring the warrenty though."
1,Defective?,"I ordered this iron, because I saw a review on Good Housekeeping and the reviews on Amazon are stellar. Although the steam output, digital display and iron temperature were good - the spray function which is super important for ironing cotton clothes - was defective in the product that was delivered to me. Instead of spraying water it simply dripped down along the iron, I was heartbroken. I have placed an order for another one hoping my item was defective. I will keep you posted!"
4,Best Iron I've Owned,"This iron is great, with a stainless soleplate, no-spit & no-hiss steam, a water well clearly visible, and a well-done digital readout system. I do a lot of sewing and the temps are nice and accurate for various textiles. And I really enjoy the vertical steam feature. To heck with pricey Rowenta. Get this one instead!The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it came with a weird fill-up cup made out of an el cheapo flimsy plastic...a laundry detergent measuring cup is way sturdier."
4,Works very well,After 7 years I had to replace my old Black & Decker iron. This one works almost as well except it is lighter in weight and the cord is shorter.
4,B&D Iron D2030,I have paid big bucks for top-of-the-line irons and have paid K-Mart prices for inexpensive models. They all last 2-3 years before developing plate and steam hole issues. This particular model is easy to use and irons nicely. I have no complaints thus far. Check with me in 2 years.
4,Back and Decker Iron,I have really enjoyed this iron. I don't like ironing but this iron has made it more enjoyable.
1,Good for one time use,"I purchased this iron in Mar and used it one time. The next time I went to use it, the digital screen was lit but blank. When I unplugged it from the outlet and plugged it back in the digital screen kept flashing strange characters. I called Black and Decker and was told the same as everyone else: send in three inches of the cord with plug, a letter and $7.50. I asked why should I send in $7.50 when the problem was with a faulty new iron. The rep waived the fee--now I am waiting for the iron. It did work well the one time I used the iron."
4,Wonderful Iron,"Does a great job, makes ironing quick and easy. I had a Black and Decker iron that was in use for over 25 years, and I am glad that I stuck with the brand!"
5,AMAZING Performance,This B&D replaced an older Rowenta. The difference has been dramatic and impressive. The B&D ironing quality rivals something you would get from a professional dry cleaner. Good value and quality. Much more than you would expect for the modest price. Makes ironing fun again!
4,Great purchase for the price!!!,One of the best irons that I have owned in the lower price category. Great and simple to use. Heats up quickly and so far has been spot on all types of material at all the given presets. If there are any drawbacks to the overall performance they are: 1) The auto shut-off when you have large projects especially sewing projects and take too much time between passes. This feature however is a great built in safety precaution for anyone with small children or anyone that is distracted and forgets to turn off the iron not unlike the auto shut off coffee maker that will certainly prevent your kitchen countertops from damage when you return to the house from a long day of work. 2) The iron is a bit heavy but then again it is difficult to find a lightweight iron that works effectively on all materials. You get everything and a little more than you pay for at this price.
5,Cadillac of irons,Wow - what a surprise that the quality of irons (at least this one) has increased so dramatically from my 10 year old $15 model. I look forward to ironing now!
1,Didn't last,"I bought this iron about eight months ago. Today it died. I plugged it in and nothing happened. It may look nice on the outside, but it is obviously flawed on the inside. I'm very disappointed."
2,good at first......,"Like my other Black & Decker iron it started off well, 2 years later it is leaking and leaving water spots, even after following the cleaning instructions. I clean this iron every couple of months so it is not neglected. I am going to stop listening to Consumer Reports on the irons. I will go with a Rowenta this time...we will see!"
5,Really Great Iron,"This is something I really hate - trying to find a new iron. The last one you liked is always discontinued so it's always a new search. My search this time ended with a great iron. It's not too heavy, great steam, a window that lights up to let you know it's ready to use, no question as to what setting you need because it tells you, and an auto-off - which I love! This is the best iron I've had in a long time.Black & Decker D2030 Auto-Off Digital Advantage Iron"
4,Black & Decker Iron,"The iron is great. Heats up quickly, is easy to fill, easy to use and irons very well. The only problem I have encountered is that the cover over where you fill the iron with water tends to pop open on it's own."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS IRON,Purchased this D-2030 iron about a month ago and it quit working after two weeks.Cut the cord off like they told me to and sent it to the Ohio servicecenter and they send me a cheaper D-2020 iron.Now they tell me that the D 2030 model is no longer available.If thats the way B&D; operate I will never buy another B&D; product again.Buyer beware!!!!!!!
4,Good Iron,"It's a good iron,with powerful steam,I used it for different types of cloths and it did all.The part I love the most is the alert light showing it's still hot,I used to burn my hands so many times before,but now I'm alerted!"
5,Great product and price,"I have ""watched"" this B&D model on line for about a year off and on. Consumer Reports gave it a great rating, and I've been looking for the best price. Finally found it. It's a terrific iron, and it is replacing my Rowenta."
5,Great Buy,"This iron is great. It is very safe with the auto shutoff feature, it heats quickly, it's easy to use, and it was available at about half the price of what some other sites were charging for it. There was not a lower price for it even on ebay. I am very satisfied with my purchase."
2,Great iron ... until..,"Bought this iron in 2008. It's lasted about 2 1/2 maybe 3 years before it started leaking.While it works, it's fantastic. Tons of steam, heats quickly and does a good job cleaning. I've had to repair it twice (before the leaking) - the cord breaks at the base, and I've had to re-cut the cord. This happened on my other B&D; iron I bought that lasted about a year or so.The repair required me to make a custom tool (the screw where this connects is a flat-blade screw, but has a divider in the middle) - so I've had to take a flat-bladed screw driver and grind out a middle slice from the blade.Long story short, it's a great iron when new. but if you want it to last, look for another iron."
4,Directions Could Be Better,A good iron at a fair price. Poor directions. You're more or less on your own to figure it out.
1,failed within 1 year,"I bought this Black & Decker D2030 Auto-Off Digital Advantage Iron because Consumer Reports ranked it #1. After less than 1 year it failed to work: it has a problem with the electrical cord!Other annoying issues: it drips a lot and, even after following the instructions for the self clean, it still displayed the ""Clean"" warning.I guess it is not worth my time to get it repaired and that I'm better off buying a better product, maybe a Rowenta Professional (DM890 or DX8800). Further, I might get it from Macy's so if it fails within 1 year I could return or exchange it.----------------Follow-up after 2 weeks: As it was under 1-year warranty they replaced it with a similar model, D5000 model, which I just received. I still had to pay $7.50 to cover for S&H.; Hopefully, the new model (also China made) would last longer than 1 year..."
5,Completely satisfied,I have always purchased Rowenta steamirons but the D2030 Black and Decker has proven to be a better choice. The steam output is just as good as most $250 professional steamirons. This is a great value.
5,A good iron,"I bought this iron in 2009 from Amazon. It is still working perfectly. One piece of advice: when the cleaning light comes on, clean it. It doesn't take long. Also, I empty the water tank every time I put it away."
3,black and decker D2030,"i was expecting that all products from black and deccker are made in USA. so first i dishearten when this iron was made in china. other this product is very good in use cos it has digital function, heavy wt, and steam function . i will recommend who used to do daily ironing the clothes"
2,Better than Rowenta,"Purchased this due to my $100 Rowenta going bad after 3 years of use. This was very well priced and actually was rated higher than our Rowenta on Consumer Reports.Good value; would buy again for the price! Wife loves it! Above review was as of 12/08. The reason why I replaced my Rowenta was due to the cord on the Rowenta becoming problematic where it enters the iron. Well, as of 9/10, this iron has the same problem. So it looks like they just can't make an iron that lasts when it has the 360 degree pivoting cord."
5,Great Iron,"So I was in search of a new iron. I came across Amazon and started to browse the selections they had for their price range of $30 - $50. I came across this one and saw the great reviews. All honesty it's a GREAT iron, has a real good sturdy feel to it and the digital display is an extra touch. Doing great and I will order again in the future if this one ever gives out. Highly recommended."
4,Black and Decker easy to use,"I purchased this product for my elderly mother. She loves the iron. The handle is not too wide or too narrow, it's diameter is good for someone with arthritis. The weight was also a factor for consideration. It's lightweight and easy to use. Additionally, it puts out ample heat to make a nice press."
5,black and decker iron,"For the price, this is the best iron I have ever owned. Check out Consumer Report's review."
4,Beeping?,"I just received this iron and all is well except when I choose the temperature setting, each setting number I cycle through beeps really loudly. So to iron cotton I have to make it beep 6 times, and then it beeps again when ready. This is pretty obnoxious but I did a quick search through all the reviews and didn't see any complaints about this. All I can see are comments about the iron beeping when ready (or when broken). This iron has amazing reviews and a really high rating, which is why I ordered it. I'm sure it will be fantastic to use, but am just wondering if all this beeping is normal. I appreciate the ""ready"" beep but all the other setting beeps make it a bit of a pain when getting ready for work while others are sleeping. Is my iron just particularly talkative or is no one else bothered by this?"
5,new age iron,I love this iron. It presses beautifully with GREAT steam and weight behind it. I told my husband that I had no idea how nice a REAL iron could be! I've used a lot of them (40 plus married years.) Highly recommend.
2,not really a review . . just a comment,"*note!* I don't actually own this CD but . . .I'm pretty disappointed in Cleopatra for this release.I KNOW for a fact that disc 3 is just a re-release of Die Laughing's 'Incarnations' CD (which, by coincidence I'm listening to right now)I wouldn't be surprised if disc 1 is a re-release of an Eerie Von disc.disc 2 looks like a decent compilation.why couldn't they have just re-released Die Laughing and Eerie Von on their own, then put out the compilation disc by itself?ah well."
4,The funniest toy!,These springs are the most simple but loved toy that you could find! My kitten plays with them about 10 hours per day!
5,I can't believe it...,"I can't believe my little furry kids love these simple toys. I bought them because they are cheap and I buy my kids all sorts of things. They both had a blast last night. One of them is more laid back and really doesn't play, she is more of a watcher. Well she played all night with the brother. This morning I had to look for them under the couch because they were trying their best to get them out. I think I will buy them another set."
5,My Cats LOVE them,"Length:: 0:19 MinsThese are great toys, and really inexpensive! I received the plastic ones described in the title and description. It is true that they dont really function very well as springs, but thats really not the point of these anyway. Theyre very lightweight so that they travel very far when batted. And their shape is diverse to keep that cats engaged. And my dog seems to have no interest in them since theres no thick pastic to chew on (he chewed on plastic balls we had gotten them)."
3,"Good rolls, but no bounce","These colorful springs look as if they would make wonderful cat toys...they are good, but not quite good enough. My cats do enjoy pushing them aroung the floor, but the springs are so stable they don't bounce at...and thus the pleasure of stalking and pouncing is limited."
1,1 order was Plastic - the next was metal - BEWARE!,"I ordered this *EXACT* item once and received 10 plastic springs that my cats LOVE. They've lost a few and I wanted to order more, so I placed an order on Jan 1st, the seller was AudioHaus, LLC. The springs I received the second time are metal, sharp, smell like paint and the paint it chipping. I refuse to give them to the cats because they seem like they would be dangerous. I am returning them to amazon. The Amazon rep says they have no way to guarantee whether if I order them again that they'll be plastic.Buyer beware!"
1,my cat gives one star,"There's no accounting for feline taste! My cat had no interest in these at all, much as I tried. I tossed them around, but she acted bored. Oh well!"
1,My cat couldn't be less impressed.,"I thought with all the rave reviews, my 3 year old cat would be going crazy with the springs. Much the opposite, she hasn't touched one since they arrived 4 days ago. I probably would have been better off buying her a pack of hair ties."
5,Cat toy,"I bought two of these, one for my cats and one for a shelter that I did some volunter work. All the cats loved them. I am always finding them all over the house so I know they are playing with them during the day while I am away and at night while I am sleeping. In fact, I can sometimes hear them swatting them across the floor."
2,"Nope, Not These Either",Bought these because of all the glowing reviews. My two could care less. I do see them in different places sometimes in the mornings but it's usually only about 1 roll from where I left them. At least I don't have to hunt them down or order more because they lost them. Ordered different kinds of these but they dissed all of them. Cats.......
5,"Very appealing, and quiet","When I hear my cats bat around a ball, sometimes the sound can keep people awake. This is especially true when they ram it in to every wall there is.From this toy, the benefits that I reaped are countless. The springs are nicely colored, appealing, soft and quiet, and most importantly durable. This a cost effective toy that is also useful for the shelter environment - for cats that get bored in the cages.Cost effective, appealing, and quiet. This is what I expect from the toy makers. Buy with confidence!"
3,OK,"I thought my cat would loves these, but I don't really see the point. I thought they would be bouncy as springs should be, but you can't bounce them. My cat likes them fine, she just pats them around with her paws like she would do with anything else..didn't need to spend the money on these toys."
2,Ethical Pet Wide Durable Heavy Gauge Plastic Colorful Springs,My cats showed no interest in this product. I believe it's becausewe have moved and they are still trying to get used to their newenvironment. You'll have to ask me later. On this one.
1,disappointed,"We have 3 cats - one is so playful she even picks up bits of kibble from her bowl and bats them around, one is totally unpredictable, and the other watches. Not one has shown the least bit of interest in this toy. This is a total surprise to me. I wouldn't discourage anyone else from giving the springs a try, if the price is right."
2,Another unused cat toy,"My 10-month old kitten played with these for about 2 minutes and hasn't even touched them since (over a month now). My 3 full-grown cats completely ignore them too. I had high hopes from all the great reviews, but no luck. The Cat Dancer and ""Da Bird"" are much more appreciated by my kitties."
1,SENDING BACK!!!,"Are you kidding me?! This is my second time purchasing these toys for my two cats, unfortunately, this time from a different seller. The first ones I bought were plastic, the ones received now are metal wire freshly painted with very smelly paint that has gathered in small drops on the wire but the toys are already all scratched up! My curious cat sniffed the package and started sneezing. Not to mention the sharp edges on both ends of each toy that could puncture an eye. Also, the cats are meant to chew on them and I don't want my cats to eat drops of paint. What in the world is the seller thinking?!"
3,Colorful Springs Cat Toy,"I think I liked these better than my cats. I am always looking for inexpensive entertainment for my darlings. At first they took a slight interest and briefly rolled them around. However, the toys were not a huge hit. I am not complaining because the cost was reasonable. I do think that the reaction to these springs will depend on the personality of your cat. As others have said, they do tend to end up under furniture, etc."
1,Waste of Money,My cats did not like this item at all. They completely ignored it. They had rather play with the tab off a milk bottle.
5,My Cat's Favorite Toy,"Who would of thought that simple colored springs would catch my cat's fancy, but they did. We have a lot of fun watching Elphaba play with the springs. She loves to paw them around on our kitchen floor, in which the springs bounce around. We lay a yardstick down in front of our stove when she plays with the springs, otherwise, they get stuck underneath the stove. After she paws the springs around for awhile, Elphaba will pick the spring up with her mouth and give her predator meow. A wonderful, entertaining toy. But just be prepared to search for the lost ones :)"
2,kitty,Cat is not a huge fan and I really got sick of stepping on them because it hurt. Maybe for another cat.
2,My cat has picked them up once and then walked away.,Bored my playful cat and im sick of stepping on them. It was a waste of money. My cat is more interested in my girlfriends hair bands.
2,I don't get it.,"To quote Tom Hank's character from the film ""Big"": ""I don't get it"". Neither does my cat. It's hard to make these things bounce, and while I've found many other many other simple, cheap cat toys that he loves (and many are homemade), the appeal of these ""springs"" escapes me and my little guy.However, they are under $4 and fulfilled by Amazon, so I can't complain too much."
1,Dangerous,I bought these for my 2 cats and was very dissapointed. I received a clump of tangled wires with sharp ends. These are not what you want for you cat.
1,Can be dangerous,"I thought these would be great for one of my cats, who loves curled up pipe cleaners. Unfortunately, when he plays with those he stretches them out. He tried to do that with these springs, and they snapped him on the foot and in the nose. Had to throw them out, think about how your cat will play with them before ordering."
4,LoL,I really don't understand why my cat loves these springs ... but he does ...they were worth the 5 dollars ... even though they cost nada to make ...now if only i can figure out a way to keep them from getting lost behind my couch ... ect.
1,DO NOT BUY!!,"These looked like something my cats would love, and has more positive reviews than negative. I expected the plastic spring toys I have seen in pet stores. I got heavy metal springs with fresh paint that was flaking off as I tried to seperate the springs from each other. They were mashed into one spring shape for shipping. They are horrible, and I will be contacting Amazon directly!!"
5,Terrific toys!,"My two kittens (12 weeks old), one female, one male both absolutely love these springs. They like them even better than the rattle balls and theyare pretty happy with those! I'm glad I got and I'm glad they come in packages of ten! So far I'm keeping track of them but the kittens bat thesethings around and they tend to go under furniture. That being said, the fact that they play with these springs more than any other toy they havemakes me happy!"
1,iHELP,"Item never received, still waiting for three Kodak Carousel 140 slide trays. Ordered on 4-16, billed cr card 4-17-2009"
2,The quality is as cheap as the price is.,"The item arrived quickly and the price was a nice deal; however, when unboxing the package I noticed that the charger was a bit broken at the end where it plugs into the phone and very fragile. The product is very cheap material and wouldn't even fit into my phone. I finally managed to sneeze it in with a bit of fixing it myself. I don't recommend for long time saving, only buy it if needed for temporary use because it won't last long. I guess you get what you paid for."
5,Thanks Aunt Lois,"As I child, I spent my summers in the small gold minning town of Dutch Flat, California. My Aunt Lois ran the local hotel for years and people came from San Francisco+ to enjoy her home town cooking. She taught me to grow organic vegetables, use pure ingredients, and even bake pies with hand picked berries. So, twenty years ago, while the mother of five children, I decided to write a vegetable cookbook where I gathered and reinvented my childhood memories into favorite recipes. The result was Too Many Tonatoes... Thanks to all of you who enjoy this book. God Bless, Happy Cooking, I send my love, Lois Landau"
4,Misery Loves Company,"Boy, does this book bring back memories of all the happily miserable hours spent hunting. Now we need books about fishing, birding, gardening and similar miserable outdoor activities that bring back such happy memories."
4,The return of Prince,"It is a pleasure to see another one of Richard Prince's works back in print. It is a faithful reprint of the original work. It contains very good information on the ACL, its component companies, steam locomotives and steamships. It is a ""must add"" to any ACL history library. The sections on steamships alone are worth the price of admission. Print and paper quality is excellent and many of the photos appear better in this relase than in the original. If this volume is well received, Indiana may be moved to reprint the remainder of Prince's excellent works. A very good volume at an excellent price and I recommend it highly."
4,Una excelente novela,"Una historia diferente, ágil y emotiva que te atrapa desde un inicio. Una buena lectura, de colección. Cien por ciento Recomendable"
4,The Hits,"This is a Good Cd containing songs from the artist of New Edition. They all did well during there solo careers. They each made songs that will be remembered. I enjoyed Bobby Brown songs the most Every Little Step, My Prerogative and On Our Own. Not Trying to leave the other artists songs unmentioned, but Bobby Brown was the true reason why I brought this cd, Even though I enjoy Bell Biv Devoe, the songs on the cd were not there best. Anyhow it's a Good Buy, Collectors items. P.S where is Johnny Gills tracks. One Love."
4,Just like new,I was very happy that my CD came as promised on time and in very good condition. I was able to play it right away. I was really happy with the service and product.
4,Straightforward approach to Thai cuisine,"This is one of the first Thai cookbooks I purchased. Since then I have purchased several others, but I keep coming back to this one as my starting point for creating an Asian menu. As most other reviewers have stated, the directions are clear and the ingredient list is manageable. Young offers some helpful tips along the way to make it easier.Some of the humor sprinkled throughout the book is an unexpected surprise. I love the spicy chili sauce recipe where the last step is ""call the fire department"".If I had one quibble with this book, it would be that more photographs of the completed recipes would be helpful. Even so it is not a major issue.All in all a good investment if you want to learn how to cook Thai food. And if you are like me, living in an area that is devoid of neighborhood Thai restaurants, it is a necessity for those of us who need our Thai ""fix"" on a regular basis."
4,"Nice book, easy to read",Good for beginner cooks. Receipes turned out good. Gave my Grandaughter this book and a wok for a present. She loves Thai food. Now she can make her own.
4,angel and the polar bear,"It is sure the girl whose name is Angel is cute but sipecially I love her toys and animal characters. Some cat is wearing swimming goggles. Another one is sliding on a bear's back. They are really enjoying, so I can feel her house is a wonderful place. If I can live her house, I would play with them every day."
1,"A Disgrace to the ""Christian"" Community","After reading this book, I was totally appalled at the information given as ""fact."" This book should not be included in any Christian library. It is evident that there is no actual personal research made by Hunt. It seems to be fictiously derived from word of mouth by uneducated individuals."
4,good enough for me,a lot of people dont like hundred hands but i think the are a good band with a lot of talent and they have some really beutiful songs
3,Charming And Yet Annoying,"Anthony and Amy are about to get married. He's, a macho firefighter, wants to fulfill his fantasy of sharing his lovely lawyer girlfriend with another woman before the nuptials. What?! The tables turn! We are seeing stereotypical ""straight"" males! Well, wait! She wants him to do the same and sleep with a guy! This is a sitcomish, romantic comedy and is somewhat charming. It pushes some buttons and has a good-looking cast it's just that it could've been a bit better. The issue of homophobia is handled well and I give them credit.I'd recommend it...."
4,Well-intentioned romantic comedy trips up!,"There are so few gay/lesbian movies (positive or otherwise) that when one comes along with good actors, fine production values, nice comic moments, and the seeming potential for mainstream appeal, you just want to cheer. However, this isn't really such a picture so much as a 'straight' romantic comedy supported by outstanding lesbian/gay characters. Unfortunately, the writers couldn't quite lighten up enough to suggest that gay sex just might be fun. Hence, a touch of irritation for what could have been but wasn't."
2,Dull comedy,"What sounds like an interesting and entertaining premise on paper turns out to be one long boring exercise in which you will probably find yourself struggling to stay awake rather than laughing. The film does not know whether it wants to be a comedy or drama and in the process, it fails miserably in both aspects. The major problem is that none of the characters seem too believable and the leads are not very interesting, especially the lead actress who is bland beyond belief. No wonder the guy wants her to have sex with someone else! The supporting actors who are playing the gay characters are much more interesting but still that is not enough to recommend it. The dvd features a trailer, gallery of stills and a commentary."
5,AWESOME from begining to end,Every song on this record rocks! The opening track grabs you and sets the tone. This stuff may be a bit heavier but it still remains radio friendly. If you are a fan of Nickelback you will love this cd. It's Nickelback with a heavier edge to it. Guitars and rythms are a little deeper with more of a growl to them. Great vocals to go along with it. One of my favorites!
1,?,"Reviewer: M. PowellWhen I first heard ""No Surprise"", I was blown away. What a great song! END OF STORY! The rest of this CD is absolute garbage. These guys sound like EVERY other band out there today.....in a VERY bad way! Nickelback is simply NOT good enough to warrant a clone! The writing is pitiful here, the songs predictable, and the throaty vocals wear you down in about 5 minutes. Download ""No Sruprise"" and save your money!what he said."
5,JCParis,"Obviouly fascinating to discover, and to imagine what ""flavour"" this dark music, often almost whispered, with doleful leitmotives, would have bring to the Hitch's movie... Probably the Herrmann's score would have perfectly fit to the Hitch's idea for the screenplay: it is a bad job to do a spy!"
5,An outstanding Blu-Ray release,"This is a preeminent Blu-Ray release in all aspects of performance, HD video and 5.1 DTS-HD Master audio achievement."
3,Good bird,This is a good book for advanced bird owners. Its not really clear enough alot of the time to understand from a beginners perspective. I would highly recommend this book to someone who already has some knowledge of companion birds.
3,My thoughts on the matter,"The Simple of it that this is something of a sequal to the first ""Stand Alone Complex"" OST. In many ways it is of the same vein. But, at the same time it's a bit quirkier and obviously inspired by the lively fellow gracing the cover. An excellent buy for fans, but if you're looking for the depth and power found in the majority of Miss Kanno's work; look elsewhere."
4,Great CD,"Well I've heard the CD..and it's pretty darn good! I know Steve..hes a great drummer. When I saw the Corban play, I thought they sounded great, so I reccommend this CD to any rock fan! Buy this CD..it's worth the price. I'm going to buy it, and you should too."
2,Blah.,"The stories don't start soon enough after the button is pressed, and the rhymes are interrumpted throughout with action noises. This would be okay, but it interrupts the rhythm of the words. My son really isn't interested in it at all. Bummer."
3,just doesn't cut it. but not at all a sink full of vomit.,"thursday definitely sounds like one of those bands that the mediocre emo-formula-i-listen-to-dashboard kids'll just eat up. what they do is nothing new, yet people cream their pants all over their unique-ness. don't get me wrong. this is a quaint little album with some strong songs, but if you want to hear some real screamo, go pick up a saetia record."
2,Nothing Special,"It is true: this band has managed to put forth a new sound, and that sound appears consistently in the CD. This new sound, however, is nothing worth getting excited about. I listen eclectically to many things, including emo, but I am not impressed. I've pinpointed what I don't like about the music. The guitar seems too thick and repetetive, with muddy and ill-defined chords. The vocal parts are strange and not very melodic, seeming not to fit the guitar parts (but then again, what could, given their ambiguous nature?). The emotion is refreshing, but there's just not enough musically to maintain my interest."
2,Same song over and over and over.,"Ok, so I bought this cd my freshman year of highschool when I had mono. I popped the cd in and got through the first 3 or 4 tracks, and came to the realization that although the music itself is solid and good, the songs follow the same structure. In fact, I tuned down my guitar to Drop-D and I played along with most of the cd using the same riff. How funny is that? All insults aside, the cd is rather bland and repetitious. I heard some songs off of their earlier cd and their new cd, and they STILL continue to follow the same formula. In fact, some of the songs I could sing along to even though it was the first time I heard them. If you enjoy overly dramatic music set to the same predictable song structure, buy this cd. If you want the same result with less effort, download ""Understanding (In a car crash)"" and set it on repeat for 50 minutes."
2,like cookies and cream with... dog food///,"ok. I used to like punk and screamo. Now I just like the lower screaming emo. Yea I have this album and the War All The Time. I never listen to these guys anymore. I used to like all the screaming and deathy lyrics, but as I got older I kind of appreciated other bands a lot more. Don't buy this cd unless you like At The Drive In. That's just who they sound like, only more screaming. Tight drums. Solid, but scratchy at times lyrics and a whole lotta good music. But they need a guy who can sing with out feeling as though he has to scream every 3 seconds. Thursday is ok, but I'm kinda dissapointed. There's better screamo out there. If you like Punk Check out Emery. Only I think They are Christian."
1,Horrible music,"This is some of the worst garbage I've ever heard. I grew up listening to bands like Quicksand, Fugazi, Rites of Spring and Embrace and the fact that those great bands gave rise to this moppy-haired emo garbage is vomit-inducing."
5,I miss this band,"This album is a testament to how great this band was. They were great songwriters & they wrote beautiful melodies to go along with the from the heart lyrics. I really wish they hadn't broke up. I never got the chance to see them perform live. If you like bands like A Day To Remember or Underoath, you should like Thursday."
4,Thursday = awesome,"Just wanted to say to ""A New Kid""... If you grew up listening to different music then go listen to that and leave us Thursday fans alone. You are entitled to your oppinion but don't you think it's sad that you have nothing better to do then make fun of other people's music tastes?I happen to really like this CD. I have not been a Thursday fan long but I really like their music. This is a great CD to have in your collection. Especially if you are into pop/punk and the emo genre. =P"
1,cool if you're 14,"A few months ago i had the misfortune of picking up this album. A sticker on the cover claims that Thursday is a mix between dinosaur jr. and the cure. A fan of both bands, i was sorely disappointed. Anyone who likes dinosaur jr. (and most likely likes other good music) will find thursday's sound boring and derivative, their lyrics laughably melodramatic, and the vocal delivery (i.e. lots of distraught screaming) unlistenable. They really raise the bar on pretentiousness as well. Overall, if you're a really sad 14-16 year old kid, i could excuse you for liking this album. If you're older, but still want some depressing music, get something decent. Some of my favorite ""dark"" records include Nick Drake's ""Pink Moon,"" Radiohead's ""OK Computer,"" Ryan Adam's ""Heartbreaker,"" Sigur Ros ""Agaetis Byrjun,"" and The Smiths' ""The Queen is Dead."" Peace"
2,"Thursday, Full Collapse -- don't bother","When I first heard the song ""The dream"", I thought, what an incredible song! Although this song isn't on full collapse, I bought the CD. After some time of ownership, I don't see what all the fuss over Thursday is. There are one or two good songs, #2, and #9. But who really wants to buy a CD with only a couple good songs? The singer's voice is immature, scratchy, and he has very little singing talent. If you can get over that, then you will somehow have to swallow 12 or so boring and distasteful songs. How did these guys make such a bad CD? The songs just aren't well written and the album is poorly put together. I do have to admit that I really like the artwork. Notwithstanding, this is just another example of punk gone bad."
4,Love it.,"""Full Collapse"" is an album that is definitely worth listening to. There's not much to say about it other than that.One thing I really don't understand is how this band is classified as ""emo"". I guess people can classify them however they want, but if you've never listened to them, don't let the label put you off, because Thursday is one of the best bands I've ever heard. Great guitar riffs that I'm just dying to learn, and the vocals are awesome as well. The vocals are sort of ""loud"" though. I'm not sure if that really explains it, but if you've heard the lead singer's voice, you know what I mean.One note though: If you have a splitting headache, this might not be something you want to listen to."
3,i have no idea what this is,my wife bought it and im going through my orders giving them reviews. im sure this is great or something.
4,Fellowes Standard Foot Rest,"I'm using this one right now and I love it, the only problem is once it comes off the roller track if you try to roll it forward or back it tends to come off the track. The bubbles on it really helps relax my feet, I love taking my shoes off and just letting the foot stool relax my feet.For me it works fine, its sturdy and well constructed for the money it is a heavy plastic. If you don't want to have to reset it on the track all the time then spend a little more and one that won't come off the track. Yet all in all I'm very please with it.. If I bought one again I would spend a little more and get one a bit heavier, one that would not come off the track. We all have our own needs for me this is great for now.."
3,"It's cheap, so what do you expect?","I chose this foot rest because I wasn't really sure that I'd use it that much and didn't want to spend a lot of money. For the price it's certainly not a rip-off, but it isn't exacly made of platinum-inlaid marble. In fact, my biggest complaint is that it's made of thin plastic and is very light. Since my computer desk at home is on hardwood foor, it slides very easily. Also, I am usually barefoot or in socks at home, and the texture is not particularly comfortable. However, if you plan on using it on a carpeted surface and wearing shoes, it's a decent buy for the money."
1,broke right away,"Made from cheap plastic, it broke in two spots within a couple months. You get what you pay for, so it's worth spending a little more to get more durable construction."
5,Excellent Tracks,A great soundtrack that shows how classical (more or less) music can still be included in modern films. A must buy!
4,Awesome Soundtrack but wrong Artists on Amazon,This is an amazing soundtrack whether you've seen the movie or not. Very moving and powerful throughout. However I would buy it on iTunes or somewhere else since Amazon doesn't seem to have the correct artists listed for each track. The soundtrack is actually done by both Burkhard Dallwitz and Philip Glass.
4,Great album but where's the Sonata?,I love The Truman Show and really liked the music... at least enough to want to buy the album. But where's the Sonata Truman listens to in the car on his way to work? Big oversight to not include that very popular piece in this collection. I found it elsewhere but wished it was on this collection.
4,"Not bad, if you like Phillip Glass","In Eastern music, what is not heard is given as much importance as what is heard. This soundtrack borrows heavily from Eastern influences. Uneasy passages of silence, or nothing but barely-audible drums, annoyed me the first time I listened to the CD.Many of the songs on the soundtrack were borrowed from Phillip Glass, including his Powqaatsi Anthem, which is wonderful. For those who have seen The Truman Show, this anthem is where you hear the pan flutes and bright trumpets. If you enjoy that type of music, I highly recommend renting Powqaatsi.Tracks called ""Truman Sleeps"" and ""The Opening"" are a real delight - this is movie music at its best.Overall, I'd recommend this CD."
3,decent product,Works well. holds good charge. If I had it to do over I would certainly get one with a clutch. This thing can strip out a screw or the hole quickly if you are not really careful. (I work around electro-mechanical devices)
3,Useful to have around.,It has been a good size to have and it would take a lot to fill up the 8gs of space. The only problem was once when I pulled it from my camera and loaded it in my laptop it was blank and it cleared everything even the things that were locked. I'm taking it as a fluke so far all has been good.
3,Works well but pretty fragile,"I had these for over a year now. I originally bought 4, the first one broke after the first time it went into the dishwasher. it had a crack at the bottom and water seeped in. So no... these are not really dishwasher safe. The second one exploded on my desk when it tipped over and fell on it's side. Since it exploded glass went everywhere, not the fault of sun's tea though. The third one exploded when it lightly tapped on the side of my porcelain sink... the fourth one exploded when i moved it a little with a spoon in it. I guess when i placed the glass down the spoon came up and down, thus cracking the glass.The glass worked as they advertised when they were still good. Although I feel the thick lip hinders the taste when you have cold beverage in it.Overall it worked well, but way too fragile for my clumsy self. I think I will just stay away from double walled glasses from now on."
1,Sure not Bodum Pavina,"I bought these hoping they would substitute for the Bodum Pavina 21-oz glasses which I love - but which are fragile. WRONG. Let me count the ways . . .1. These are supposedly 20-oz. Don't believe it. Hold much less than the Bodum 21-oz. I measured with my measuring cup. At 16 oz. of water, the Sun's Tea glass was full to a normal drinking level. I couldn't get another 4 oz. in there even with the advantage of surface tension to hold it above the top.2. These are supposedly ""no sweat"" like Bodum because of the double wall. Don't believe it. They sweat as badly as my single-wall glasses.Yes, they are less fragile than Bodum Pavina. And they aren't bad-looking. I can't think of anything else positive to say.If you want a nice-looking, fairly heavy glass and want to spend twice what it would cost for the equivalent single-wall glass - enjoy them. But, as far as I can tell, you're just choosing to waste your money."
1,Too fragile to use,"I bought four of these about one year ago. The last one exploded today when I was at the refrigerator door adding ice. The whole bottom of the glass blew up and threw glass all over one end of my kitchen. I really enjoyed the use of the glasses while they lasted but I won't even consider replacing them. I treated all four of the glasses with kid gloves but each died for tiny infractions. I never stirred the contents with a metal stirrer. I always hand-washed the glasses with a plastic bottle brush and dried them individually. I didn't let them come into contact with other glassware. The first broke after being bumped on the rim by another glass. The second broke when it slipped from my hand and fell into the sink. The third fell over in an empty sink, and the fourth exploded in my hand while adding ice at the refrigerator door. There is no margin for error with this glassware and I am not going to buy any more just to find another odd failure mode."
1,exploded,within the first week we bought the cups one has already exploded and got glass everywhere it was very loud i would not recommend these cups to anyone
1,Exploding glasses!!!!!!!!!!,"Three of four glasses have now broken. Two of the four ""exploded"". The first time, by dropping an ice cube into the glass (if you insist upon buying these, always put room temp liquid in glass BEFORE adding ice.) Second one also exploded, this time for no good reason. Third one was knocked over by cat and broke just by tapping the counter. I would NEVER buy these again, and would strongly recommend against them. And, in Hawaii's humid climate, the glasses still sweat - although not as bad as single-wall glasses. (They also are not very attractive looking.)"
1,Avoid this product!,"I bought this glass for myself during Christmas 2011. I used them for less than 1 week, and already BOTH shattered while HANDWASHING. I never used them with extreme temperature liquid, so my guess is that its made with poor quality glass. Don't waste your money."
1,DON'T BOTHER LOUIE LOUIE IS THE ONLY CUT WORTH ANYTHING.,I'D HAVE GIVEN 1/2 A STAR IF I COULD HAVE. THE SOUND QUALITY IS NOT GOOD EVEN ON CD.THE KINGSMEN MUST HAVE A RULE:NEVER PRONOUNCE MORE THAN 2 WORDS PER SONG.NOT WORTH ANOTHER WORD!
3,orbeat,"It,s not the real Dave, he is more strong than in other cd and his music sounds like at the beginning of techno minimal. This is not a critic way to send, but is also a our point of view.At the end is a good production for foreign market"
2,Just plain horrible.,"I usually read all the reviews of items I purchase here. I must have forgotten to do so for this one.To be sure: All three previous reviews are accurate.The coughing during the Segovia part is extremely aggravating: the first time you think ""Ah, a cough .. must be live"", the second time you frown, the third time you sigh, the fourth time you think ""take some cough drops already"", by the end of the Segovia part you have to restrain yourself to not throw the CD across the room.The Montoya part .. the sound quality is SO bad, it simply hurt my ears. Words like harsh, jarring, tinny, noisy, raspy, piercing, and above all, SHRILL come to mind.$6 isn't much, but there's a difference between a sub par CD and one that's outright aggravating. Save yourself that $6!"
2,Boring.....,"I'm still not sure what inspired this ""Tribute"" album to Faith Hill, but it was such a mistake. I have NO idea who any of the artists on the CD are (I ""think"" I may have heard Lila McCann there somewhere), but they don't give credit to Faith's hits or her talent. It's almost like sitting through a very bad karaoke contest. You know the effort's there, but there's just no delivery. I don't suggest this CD at all. If you want the real deal, go buy one of Faith's releases.Gennie Bailey-Rogers"
4,Work well but loud material.,"Got these bibs for camping and hunting. I like how I can zip them on and off without having to strip down or take my boots off which helps prevent from getting cold in the first place. They are true to size. I wear 34x32 pants and occasionaly I'll do 36"" waist. I figured I should go a little bigger to layer clothes under them. I had to send back the 36x32 they where absolutely enormous. 34x32 Works great and I can easily layer a t-shirt, long sleeve, and sweat shirt in addition to jeans or sweat pants. My only complaint is the material is really loud. When approaching game I have to walk with my legs spread apart to prevent them from spooking wild boar. Of course these are designed for work and not hunting so I guess I should of expected that."
1,Waste of money,This isn't even what I would consider a book. Its more like a pamphlet. At least I didn't spend too much money on it but what I did spend was way to much. I wish I would of not gotten this book.
4,all good but the color,"Packing is good, material is solid wood, assembly is easy and the table is sturdy. But the color is totally different from the one shown in Amazon picture which is reddish which I prefered; the one I got is very dark and nearly black which was a bad surprise."
3,"Good locale, bad plot","A pleasant enough read, except that the plot is riddled with improbabilities and unbelievable behavior by key characters."
2,AN EMPTY NOVEL,"While admiring Bishop Robert L. Wise for approaching the mystery genre via the Christian faith, one still can't forgive Wise for bringing us a rather dull and empty book. THE EMPTY COFFIN sets the stage for an interesting murder, but it gets sidetracked so many ways, including Raymond Bench's accidental murder? of a liquor store manager. Add Vera Sloan's incessant nagging, whining and seemingly a lack of understanding of her husband's job and you have a novel that goes nowhere fast.Sam Sloan's interrogation of Ape is so redundant, it seems like Wise is simply padding. Sloan's daughter comes across as a miscreant Pollyanna. You know who the killer is so fast that there's little suspense in getting him to admit it. Slow, with some ghastly editorial errors, THE EMPTY COFFIN is the first in a new series. Hopefully, Wise will get wise and start thinking about his reader's interests---mystery. The Christian element is fine, but just write more interesting works."
5,Right Sized stackable containers,"This Iris 33 quart stackable storage tote is right sized for storage of scraping materials, sorted photographs, audio books and cds, among other things. There are smaller and larger sizes and the great thing is they are stackable. I've used them for records storage, clothing and memorabelia. Good buy"
1,"Not Acoustic, Hardly a Tribute","Largely uninspired performances, with far too much synthesizer and drum machine nonsense - I'm don't think there's a single acoustic instrument in ""Crosstown Traffic..."". A great idea, but very poorly realized. Stick with ""Blue Haze"" or ""In From the Storm"" (and perhaps a few others...) if you're looking for Hendrix tributes...."
3,"Good for creativity, but expensive","This toy was good for my child's imagination, my daughter could take it apart and make new things if she wasn't happy with her creation. It was easy to use and make projects, but for what you get its overpriced. You could go to a craft store and buy what what's in the kit for much less."
5,True Classic from the Genus of Don Coscarelli,If you were lucky enough to live in southern california back then and rode down Signal Hill this is your film. Felt like I was watching my own growing up with the accuracy of that time. All so well written and produced with the originality only Mr. Coscarelli could bring us(can you say Phantasm). The movie is a day in a life or a week in a month of all the great adventures and NO responsibilities that us punks never had or wanted at that age. ENJOY!
4,origin-of-a-word selection -- with -- it was good,"It is the movie seen dozens of years of ago.Since it was not found in Japan, it was good to be found.I will carry out English study!"
5,"Excellent card, NOT FOR GAMING","I second the previous review. This card is for graphic rendering in applications, not for pumping graphics for video games. Anyone in the industry will tell you the same. Do not let uneducated reviews deter you from purchacing this card as it will outperform any high end gaming card on the market today.If you want glitzy graphics for the latest video games, look elsewhere.If you want a powerful entry-level rendering card, look no further."
1,Insane Price!,"I don't know who would spend so much money on this???64MB Sgram , phh please!Buy something else!"
5,Falco is great!,"This is a great book, the first in a series starring Falco. Non-stop action, a wise-cracking protagonist, and lots of info I didn't previously know about the 1st-century Roman Empire. I'm sure there are some anachronisms in this book, but it's a small quibble.Suggested to me by my Classics professor."
2,no silver pigs here,"the book arrived in great shape-just didn't like it, the style, the content..just not for me I guess..lots of good reviews out there however..."
1,don't buy this piece of junki,"I actually ordered another similar mouse, but the amazon merchant [ olive ties] shipped me this one [ with the GREEN TRACK BALL] instead; sort of a bait & switch game, I guess. I used it for 15 minutes and the track ball became very im-precise and jittery. It is useless for controlling the cursor with. It is useless.It says model fdm-g62 on the label , made by ""3d green globe company"", China. It sells on Amazon under different manufacturer names, it seems.I will not return it because the shipping costs to return it would be as much as the mouse cost me. I will just junk it.Don't buy this, at any price."
2,Igg...not even sure this is food...,"No no no no noI just cant get past the taste of the rice itself. The garlic/butter scent was appealing, but the chemically processed flavor of the rice itself - iggg....I just cant do it.I purchased this along with some prepared main dishes, and hoped my elderly grandfather would like it as an alternative to a frozen dinner. He apparently has no tastebuds left because he said it was good...I gave it two stars because he said it was 'ok for something different than the norm'."
4,The Real Low-Down on the NRA!,"Sugarman's book provides an excellent history of an organization that annually bilks millions of dollars from America's gun owners -- the National Rifle Association. 40,000 Americans die every year from gunshots and Sugarman uncovers the organization that helps to perpetuate the slaughter!"
2,creedence clearwater revisited,"I'll be honest, I didn't figure I'd care for this CD. After all, John Fogerty, the original CCR lead vocalist is not featured on the discs. Instead, what you get is a sound-alike singer, backed by original bassist and drummer Stu Cook and Doug Clifford, and a couple of other guys doing fill-ins on other instruments. John Tristo, though a good Fogerty imitator, is no Fogerty, and fans of the original CCR will feel slighted. Musically, the songs are tight and well played, but are all missing the wonderfully raw Fogerty vocals. Basically, what you get here is Creedence Clearwater Kareoke. Revisited is a decent cover band, but stick to the original CCR."
1,John Fogerty Does Not Play On This CD,"Not Creedence Clearwater REVIVAL. Just Doug, Stu, and some soundalikes"
1,Lousy immitation.,"This set was really a dissapointment. The two origional members that play in this group are probably the least important. What I mean is that this is like The Who without Daltry and Townsend, the Doors without Jim Morrison, or the Stones without Jager and Richards. Basically you can't pass off a cheap immitation with thedrummer and bassist. Especially when they weren't renowned for their skill anyway. I mean they aren't terrible but they aren't Ginger Baker and Jack Bruce. What was really an insult to injury is the whole thing is a concert that sounds like all five members of the audience are really having a good time. Add this to lamealbum art that anybody with MS Paint on their computer could have made. Another sad thing is that the band itelf is so terrible that I'm sure you could hear better at a high school in the southern states. Please, don't buy this! If you want to hear a good classic rock band that still sounds good go see The Who!"
1,TenkaichiBukokai Stadium Stinks,"Do not buy this unless you want a pile of plastic. The first time my son put it together some of the cheap plastic pieces stuck to other pieces (that weren't supposed to be stuck together) and other pieces of the ""walls"" broke. This toy was a total waste of money!!!!"
1,Dont even bother!,"My 11-yr.old son has been a DragonBall fan for a few years now, and when I saw this Stadium, I knew he had to have it! What a great idea for having his battles, and maybe even storing his figures! Boy, was I wrong! This stadium is so flimsy- we didn't even bother to take it all the way out of the box! It is made of cardboard, and wouldnt last a week of my son's action-packed fighting! Too bad, too- because this product really had potential!"
1,should not even be on the store shelf,Another example of toy manufacturers taking advantage of young kids. It should never even be in the store. My son spent his Christmas money on it and it was a huge let down. It is hard to watch your kid walk away in tears because they were taken.
4,Very Informative,"If you know nothing of the 2012 prophecies then this is a good video for you. The movie was slow in some parts but overall, I felt it explained the 2012 scenario and some of the opinions that surround it pretty well. I have seen several DVD's on this subject and this one is realtively unbiased and not a doomsday version like some that are out there. A great little movie for your spiritual collection."
4,2012 The Odessey,"Very informative, I especially appreciated the refrains from ""the usual Doomsday"" predictions, This is much better balanced. Wish they had covered more ground, segments seemed to be abrupt. therefor only a 4"
2,The Odd..issy,"Though I, too, was rather disappointed in the dvd, I still got something out of it. However, not so much as to view it a second time. I think it tried to cover too much and ended up a mish mash. It didn't go indepth into any particular aspect and so ended up as the equivalent of a bad coffee table book. A great opportunity missed I feel. I still ended up knowing little more about the Mayans and I hoped I would learn more. As a seeker for truth no matte where it leads, I found this documentary not to find a place on my must watch list. I also found the movie difficult to get into as there is such a lot of pre hype before it starts."
4,Not so blind as that I can not see,"I believe I believe, or so I think I do. What I can't believe is the idea that on Dec 21st of 2012 we will wake up with a new consciousness. I believe in the process but wouldn't it take 100 drds of years, at least some years LOL.Wouldn't there still be people left behind, stuck in the old thinking. In other words why does anyone think it will be noticeable?Evolution can be fast but how fast is fast."
2,Pretty Cheesy,"Not bad overall, has some interesting stuff, but it was pretty cheesy and I was ready to turn it off about half way through."
4,Great in the classroom,"I teach special education classes in a jr. high school. This program (and the 5th Grade Adventure) is terrific for my students who are 6th to 8th graders reading at 3rd to 5th grade level. they have the same interest as every other Jr. High student, but not the ability to process at the same level. My students play this game all the time -- It is not patronizing to the students like a Reader Rabbit game would be. I have purchased several copies so that more than one student can play at a time. I HIGHLY reccommend it."
3,10 year old software is wonderful on a real old computer (XP or better earlier),With half a day of hacking I got it working on an old PC runningservice pack 1 Windows XP in effectively windows 98 mode.Mattel bought this software company (Learning Company) for nearly 4 billion and sold it on fortens of millions and no-one has upgraded a product since.Sad as between it and reader rabbit there is no competition.It's not like parents and teachers have stopped needing great games like this.Be warned will only run on old machines and there is no tech support.Games rock.
4,"Excellent Moisturizer, Smooth fine lines, Soften skin","The first week that I used the product with vitamin e oil: helps soften my skin, diminished my laughing lines a bit, reduce scars slightly as well. Works wonder in moisturizing my skin and wake up the next morning with beautiful soft skin.I have acne prone skin but this actually soothes out my acne and doesn't give me breakout after applied from night before.Texture and scent is similar to a cold cream but a bit lighter.The only downside is that it is slightly greasy and does not have SPF (UVB/UVA) for day, other than that, I love this product."
4,Good Stuff.,"This is a nice, thick, greaseless cream I use on my face and any other dry skin areas. I have used it on my daughters, too, and really feel the moisture all day long. I have found it to be useful on my very rough, chapped hands, especially when used as a night cream."
2,You get what you pay for . . . . not much!,"I read a number of the reviews to the effect that the blade was too flexible and didn't cut well. I thought: it's Fiskars, a highly-regarded brand, how could it be that bad. Well, it is. The extending pole is great. But for anything beyond cutting a green, soft, no more than one inch branch the blade is practically useless. Save your money by spending more on a better product that will handle tougher jobs."
2,Of no use to me,"The saw blade is very sharp. The extendable pole works well. However, it is not practical for sawing a limb 12 feet in the air. One cannot cut the limb when it is unstable flopping around in the air. And it will not cut a limb more than two inches in diameter. This product was a disappointment and of no use to me."
3,Ok for the cost,"Can't beat the price on this one. The pole itself is very good, the locking systems works good. But the blade that comes with it, toss it in the garbage and buy a good one. With a good blade, it is excellent."
5,Just Right,"Works GREAT and does EXACTLY what I need it to.That said, there's no comparing this saw to a $200 Silky, but for the price, and intended purpose, it's just right.I'm using it for clean-up after storm damage and just general purpose ""grooming"" and cleaning up of low-hanging and broken branches. It can be a little flexible at full extension, but with a little practice, that's no big deal. It's sturdy enough for small to medium branches and the reach is just right. The teeth on the supplied blade are aggressive enough to cut reasonably quickly, but not so coarse that they get hung up easily. While I certainly wouldn't recommend this for ""professional use,"" it's PERFECT for the average homeowner, especially for the price. Overall, a great tool!"
3,Choose a different one,"Cute, but music is off key. Difficult for a young child to operate without help. Keeping it, but not impressed."
3,a little dissapointed!,"I was defintely a little dissapointed in this toy. The metal hands did get tangled up in the box and my 20 month old son tried to turn the handle and realized he just has to push the bright blue top lever down for the monkey to pop out whenever he wants it to- defeating the purpose of the ""jack in the box wind-up"" thing in the first place. Also, it was too difficult for him to put the monkey back in to ""reset"" without help. The monkey is cute - It looks too much like a plush animal so my son wants to play with it and is mad that it won't come out of the box! Cute design, just needs a stonger lever to hold the monkey inside."
4,Traditional toy with a new look,"This is a fun toy with the classic ""jack in the box"" style and music. The little hands have velcro to make the monkey play peek-a-boo (added bonus). I think the design is less scary for tiny ones who may not like clowns. Very please with this product and I appreciate toys that don't require batteries! As always in this type of toy, it takes a little learning and coordination to be able to wind it the right direction and patience to wait for the ""pop"" but this is exactly like the jack in the box toys we used to use as kids."
1,don't bother,"I picked the book up from the library and thought it would be a fun read. I looked for his reviews of my home state (SC). I have a sense of humor about my home state, which certainly makes it into the 'news of the weird' often enough. Lost all value to me when he reviewed Charleston (SC), and put Myrtle Beach and also the former Jim and Tammy Baker ""Christian theme park"" there. The theme park has been gone for decades, and is near Charlotte NC (nowhere near the coast). Myrtle Beach IS a horror, but is the upper coast region. Both are several counties away from Charleston. I can't understand why either would make an appearance in a review of Charleston. The author simply hates everything/everyone. Why bother reading it if he has no idea where the supposedly horrible destinations are. His reviews are just mindless blather."
5,Math Their Way a Must for Kindergarten,Mary Baratta-Lorton has put together a phenomenal math resource for teachers. A foundation for your math program is in this book. Lessons are easy to follow and often there is a section of why a particular skill is important for young children to learn. An excellent resource for K teachers.
5,Johnny Cash is a friend of mine too,great tribute by D.A.C.DAC's voice and arrangements are very flattering to the Cash classics. Sunday Morning Sidewalk may be better than the original.
2,Eh... it's ok,I was hoping for better results from this product. I don't feel like it makes my hair stronger nor does it help with thinning hair. I feel like I have to use a lot more of this conditioner just to get a comb through. I will not buy this again.
2,"""Foreigner...NOT""","This group should have a different name. I was very excited to hear that foreigner would be on soundstage! Then as I'm walking downstairs to my theater with my ice cold soda, it took all of two seconds to realize that something was not kosher. I couldn't even see the screen yet but I could tell that was NOT Lou Gram singing! This is a great concert if you have never heard Foreigner or even Lou's solo stuff before , as the band is tight and the singer is very good. The sound is of a well recorded cover band. The reason it sounds like a cover band is due entirely to the fact that the single most recognizable sound of the group is absent. So my recommendation is this. If you're not familiar with Foreigner, buy this disk. The music is good quality , the band is very good. Then rush out and buy one of there original cd's. Then you'll see what I'm talking about , Without Lou's vocals this is a good tribute band. Much like queen with Paul Rogers , this is quality music but Not Foreigner."
3,A disappointment-not a true revision,"This was billed as a revised edition, and it is not a truly revised edition. It is a re-formatted edition, with some new archival illustrations, but the text has not been altered at all.Since the printing of the first edition of Square Meals, some things have changed, particularly the potential danger of salmonella poisoning. Many of the recipes in Square Meals call for raw eggs, and it would have been a real service if the Sterns' had added a notice about the potential danger of raw eggs. I have actually cooked from the first edition, and the recipes I have tried have worked well.It is good to have this back in print, but this is not a true revision.The original forward by the great MFK Fisher has been retained."
4,A popular Aussie miniseries,"A love story between a headstrong independant woman Delie Gordon (Sigrid Thornton) and a riverboat captain Brenton Edwards (John Waters) and the river that brings them together.Going by another review, All The Rivers Run (now on DVD, Region 0, digitally enhanced 2 disc version with a run time of 293 minutes) is apparently still not the full series."
5,Still too much Editing!,"I rate All the Rivers Run with 5 stars. Yet I purchased the DVD version that is available from Australia, and just like the VHS version, THIS DVD HAS LOTS OF SCENES DELETED OUT OF IT TOO! For example, the scene where Deli visits her uncle Charles to ask him to give her away at her wedding is deleted, along with many other scenes. Why is this? When I saw ATRR on HBO cable, it was complete. So looks like this DVD version is just as crummy (because of the ediing) as it's VHS counterpart. The only thing that makes this DVD better than the VHS are the behind the scenes looks, and interviews with Sigrid Thornton and John Waters."
5,All the rivers run,"There seems to be a 2-disc edition on DVD in Australia;the cover states that it contains all 6 episodes,and interviews with Sigrid Thornton and John Waters.The included information states that it is for zones 1,2,3,4,5&6.I found it on EZYDVD.COM.AU,and have placed an order,although it is marked as ""currently out of stock"".Anyway,good luck to you all.exbaxoz"
3,Not Near As Good As Jurassic Park,I don't know what happened to John Williams on The Lost World. It almost seemed like he was obligated to compose the music for this movie. It's not the same as the beautiful soundtrack of Jurassic Park. The only track I really liked on that CD was the first one.
3,Rather disapointing,"This soundtrack isn't bad, but it's not up to John Williams' usual standards. It sounds pretty cool at times but most of it is either fairly weak or rehashed from the first films soundtrack. I recommend this CD for the 1st track. It's the only track that I feel Williams really put any work into"
2,Poor Sounding Master,"Be aware of this release. This CD is put out by the French division of EMI and for reasons I cannot fathom, the sound has been aggressively assaulted with noise reduction effects. The distortion of the original recording is so bad as to muffle out acoustic guitar on some tracks. My suspicion is that this disc was mastered from a vinyl source instead of a tape master.There is a version of this album on CD by EMI which does not include any extra tracks. That is the one to buy because it is mastered properly. Trust me, the difference in sound is dramatic.The extra tracks on this release were made available on a CD called ""Hollies Rarities"" by EMI in 1988. This disc appears to be no longer available but try to find it as it is also properly mastered and includes a total of 17 great obscurities."
3,"Good Music, Bad recording","This is a subset ofSpirit of IncasThey both have the same problem. Poor quality recording. It sounds like an lp with light pops and crackles. I don't know the artists, but if you like Los Incas or Urubamba, you will like this, if you can get by the annoying pops and crackles. I would give it five stars for the music. I would recommend following the above link, and getting it instead, you get all the same songs, plus a lot more for less money."
1,UghhhUghhhhUghhhhh SO BORING and not REAL Pro Wrestling,NO COMMENTS. That tape should deserve below 0 stars.Believe me don't waste your money at all.Look for ECW and FMW DVD's much better.
4,"Tiny, affordable, easy and powerful","This is simple to set up, saves a lot of room if you know what your doing, and you dont need to worry about an amp. also it packs a powerful punch for such a small thing. I had it in my 1985 ford mustang hatchback and it sounded great! of course it probably wouldnt have much power in the trunk of a car or a suv. But overall, I loved it."
2,not what we expected,this short is more of a kid friendly documentary than anything eles really not for a three yr old he was very bored with it........
5,A book to bring to the lonely island,"If you want to lose yourself for a while and enter into the world of adventures, islam culture, romance and fairy tales, this is exactly the book for you. It is one of the most capturing stories that I have ever read and I have just bought a pile to give away for all my book loving friends. I hope that more books will follow by this marvellous writer"
2,Re-hashed trash with a glossy cover and slick production.,"If you want to learn more about the phenomenon, then dont bother looking at this DVD. The only slightly intresting bits are the ""extras"" and the last 1/3 of the main DVD - Saucer Tech.The first main sections of the DVD iterates that only scientits are able to discern reality from non-reality. So called specialists think that UFO's are figments of the imagination or sleep paralysis.There is so much denial of ""hard"" or ""real"" evidence such as radiation burns, physical debris and other physical evidence, yet of course only SETI can tell us if the aliens are out there with their primitve alien radio transmitters.It's a shame Jeri Ryan wasn't actually ""in-shot"" or I'd have given a few more stars just for her appearance!If you're gonna buy, put this at the bottom of your wishlist."
2,A troubled work,"Chapter 1 made several good points. Chapter 2 was more confusing in its presentation but I got something out of it. Chapter 3 began the hands-on so I installed the sample files and sample database contained on the accompanying CD-ROM -- only to find that I couldn't successfully install the database! The CD contains only the "".mdf"" file for the sql database (no .ldf), not enough to ""restore"" or ""attach"" the database. Their script to install the DB also errored out. I was unable to locate any useful help or errata on the MsPress website. It looks like the authors spent a lot of time and effort developing the step-by-step examples so I'm quite disappointed that I can't proceed further into chapter 3. I'd recommend looking to the Microsoft SSAS tutorial instead of this book."
5,Negotiation headstart or refesher,"Although negotiation skills are nurtured overtime and solidified with practice, this book quickly and simply communicates the main corner stones and phases of effective negotiation. The font and layout assist fast reading and the subject is covered concisely to enable a satisfactory grasp of the concept in a few hours - without oversimplifying the message and compromising the value to the reader."
5,Excellent all- around introduction..,This anthology is an excellent all- around introduction to English poetry produced by a great scholar and appreciator of poetry.
5,Herbert Holeman,This little book is written for writers. It teaches the writer how to use punctuation to achieve a particular effect in the reader. Keep this book by your side.
5,Exellent Reference Book,"The book starts with Music theory basics: Rhythm, Styles, Melody, Harmony, Advanced Harmony Substitution and voice arrangement, etc. Then It takes a structured look at the different sections of the band (Rhythm, Brass, Woodwinds, Strings) Explaining how each works, instrument ranges, how to write parts for each, etc. I have had this book for several years, and although I consider myself an accomplished musician/arranger, I refer to it often, especially when it comes to unfamiliar instruments/ensembles. This book is a must for beginning/aspiring arrangers."
4,Good summer reading for the avid duck hunter,"The book is well written with a variety of stories. A good blend of philosophy and duck hunters stories. It really takes someone who has anxiously stayed awake all night packing the car, then rowed a skiff into the cold winter darkness to appreciate this book. A good summer read, when you can't hunt ducks in North America. Author likes Argentina!"
2,long ago purchase,too shorta a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a .ok already!enough words and time from me already
5,FANTASTIC!!!!,The first Never-ending story was wonderful! It took you out of the living room into the fictious world it was set in. i loved falcor!!! i want a luck dragon for my very own. The second one was good but not quite as good as the first one. The characters were all too different. But it was good that sebastian had to conquer his fear in order to get out of the magical world. All in all these two movies are worth having. They are So creative!!!!
2,"Beware--Jar and Pickle very small, pics don't show scale of item.","The jar and the pickle are both exactly as pictured, but the jar, pickle, and product label are misrepresented in scale by these extreme closeup pictures. Buyer beware, the pickle is VERY VERY SMALL. The end use for this pickle is to hide it on a Christmas tree for the children to find on Christmas morning, a bit of a game with the ""winner"" earning an extra present. Good luck with that--unless the kids are over 10 yrs old and they use magnifying glasses it could take 1/2 the day and lead to frustration for the kids and parents. The silly thing is barely 2"" long and not even 1"" in diameter.It isn't worth the effort or expense to return it, I've just ordered a different one that we will actually use and I'll give the other one to someone with older kids. Hope this saves another person from making my mistake."
3,Gibson marketing material,"Good for what it is, but as James Caldwell notes, this is totally Gibson focused. At least Fender labels its DVDs as Fender so you know what you're getting. I play Gibsons and have nothing against them. This DVD is a little over the top though...I'm surprised they didn't try to portray Jimi Hendrix as King of the Gibson Flying V. Good footage, lots of interesting guitar characters (probably a few you've never heard of), decent playing. Lots of guitar fondling."
3,A Gibson odyssey...,"""A Gibson Odyssey"" would be an appropriate title. Did anybody else notice that every guitar pictured, played or mentioned (whether it be acoustic, solidbody electric, hollowbody electric or bass) was a Gibson? That's why you won't find EVH or any other non-Gibson player featured here. This video is okay. Kind of interesting. A friend of mine insisted I watch it knowing that I'm a guitar fanatic. I enjoyed watching it, but it's not something I will treasure till the end of time. Actually, I found the player outtakes to be rather boring and uninspiring. I mean I love 'Frampton Comes Alive', but watching him jam in his home studio was a big dissappointment - nothing exciting in his performance at all. Same goes for Steve Howe - I always thought of him as a genius/giant, but he couldn't have put on a more boring display. Still, it's worth a look for the historical content."
5,Great Book for any TV Trivia Fan!,I just recieved this book and it really looks like it was done well! It has 50 sections with about 20 questions in each section. You Watch Too Much TV covers everything from Animation to Horror Related shows. The questions range anywhere from easy to Very Hard (atleast for me). I Highly Recommend this TV Trivia Book!
5,The Exodus Revealed: Searching for the Red Sea Crossing,"This dvd explores the possible route the Israelites could have taken during their exodus out of Egypt. It begins with evidence of their presence in Egypt at the time of the biblical exodus as well as evidence of their presence in Canaan at around the same time period, indicating they must have traveled across the desert to get there. Based on biblical, historical data, as well as current archaelogical findings and under water exploration, this dvd reveals a very plausible, intriguing theory for where the Israelites crossed the Red Sea. Very well done."
5,Powerboat 1000,Have had it over a year with no problems! Works so well I bought one for my back door ..... very satisfied !
2,Concerned...,I haven't purchased this electronic door lock although I REALLY want to. My concern is that the installation screws appear to be on the exterior side of the mechanism. Wouldn't it be amazingly easy for someone to walk up with a phillips screwdriver and just remove the lock? Most locks have the screws on the interior of the door. Can someone that owns this lock tell me if I'm wrong?
2,Kitchen for Ants!,"This kitchen is so small! My 3 year old daughter towers over it and I think she doesn't like it because it is so small. My 14 month old like it though. I can't believe this is for 3 to 8 year olds. This kitchen would come up to an 8 year old's knee. It was easy to set up, and I like that it is wood. The accessories are very nice, but I would not buy this again."
4,Another engaging read by Catherine Coulter.,"Quite good, even by Coulter's standards. Never having read the original (The Generous Earl), I can't comment on any improvements, but the characters are hilarious, and the story is vastly amusing. Worth reading, if only to meet the Robertsons and witness their insane escapades. It's not terribly heavy, as romance novels go, a nice light read. I finished it in two days."
5,Excellent transaction!,I received my item really quickly and in excellent condition! I didn't have any need for further communication since I was completely satisfied with my shipment! A+ transaction!
1,Not to my liking...,"sorry to say this, but this is probably one of the weakest stories ever written by ms. coulter. the plot is quite unremarkable (and i really didnt feel much for that thing about them being cousins), and the romance is sadly lacking.i felt too that the secondary characters were given too much roles or dialogues, thereby resulting in a story that is more of a family drama than a romance tale. i feel bad about reading this one coz i was hoping to find a better novel by ms. coulter after reading a disappointing The Countess."
5,Five Stars (for Fans and Scots),"This album is a healthy collection of acoustic and electric performances. Some songs are revealed here as obvious fan favourites based on the crowd participation. There isn't a stinker among them, so it comes highly recommended. Do check the samples here.Those who are only familiar with their ""In A Big Country"" song, may be surprised by the rest of their material, so I don't know if it's a good intro to the band. I also recommend it though, because it gives an idea as to what good contemporary Scottish rock is all about. These are heart-felt, subtantial lyrical expressions presented to us, dealing with a variety of issues."
4,"A Lego Toy that is Fun, just for GIRLS!!","This clikits product is very fun. This toy is fun, but I gave it 4 stars because I could only make two things out of it and I don't want to take it apart!! 2. I gave it 3 stars for educational value because, it's a toy but not for education but it has creativity in it and kids can learn to put things together in there creative ways. But it might be hard to put the things together but in a while you'll find out how to get it through. So it is fun and you can decorate your room with the Clikits Girls' products, Daisy, Heart, and Star."
2,Run. Far away.,"What can I say? This thing is remarkably consistent. No matter what bread you throw in this toaster -- thick bread, thin bread, white, dark, rye, long slice, short slice -- it will toast it unevenly. One end is charcoal, the other golden brown. I've seen people toast more evenly holding a match under a piece of bread. It also has a convenient lip right at the opening so it is difficult to slide your toast out when it's finished.I've owned only really cheap toasters my whole life (before this one) and every single one of them toasted better than this device. The only nice things I can say about this toaster are 1) it looks halfway nice and 2) for people like me who like their toast on the darker side, it can do the job (albeit very unevenly) without two cycles. Put it on #6 or so and you're golden/charred. But overall, I wouldn't wish this toaster even on my enemies."
2,Won't Toast,"My friend that insisted that I buy this toaster brought over his Breville Ikon last weekend and we did a toast off. We used corn rye, set the settings at 6 and pushed the levers down at the same time. So here's what happened, my new toaster finished way ahead of his showing us that the timers are very different on each of these. My toast was not toasted and his was close to burned. We then tried the 8 setting, my toast was just beginning to toast, his set the smoke detector off. Today I tried 3 pieces and put the setting on 9. The side with the single piece toasted pretty well, the two others on the other side didn't brown the bread. So far I'm very dissatisfied with this toaster and have sent an email to Breville and explained what happened. They asked what the 3 digit numbers on the bottom of the toaster was so maybe they could tell me what they have done to the timing. As of today I'll probably send this back, but I will wait to hear from Breville."
2,Not there!!!,Maybe I'll never find the perfect toaster in my lifetime. This one works no better nor any worse then any of the eight or ten I've owned in my life.
1,Stopped working after 1 year,It's a good looking toaster but I am not satisfied with an appliance that dies after one year...and even more disatisfied with a company that refuses to repair (even at a cost) or replace the defective product. Will not purchase from this company again!
4,Breville CT75XL 4 Slice Toaster,"We got off to a shaky start when the documentation said turn off the toaster at the switch after use, in fact there is no switch on the toaster it pretty much shuts itself off just like any other toaster. Otherwise I input one or more slices of frozen white bread and it outputs the same number of hot brown bread. Consequently the toaster sits happily working out its destiny on my kitchen counter while I contemplate the weightier matters of the cosmos."
2,"Good looks, lacking in function.","I don't really have complaints about the toasting ability of this toaster. It browns the bread adequately, although as other have said there is not much point in the settings going up to 10 when a setting of 4 will burn the toast. My complaint is that you cannot only select one slot at a time for toasting. Many other 4 slice toasters have separate darkness setting for each pair of slices, which is nice if you want to toast different kinds of bread at the same time. Also, with this toaster if you only have 2 slices you still have to power up the whole toaster (wastes a bit of energy). Finally, the toaster is 1500W and produces a lot of heat, both above and on the side surfaces, so you have to be extra careful to keep cords away and not use it below cupboards."
4,Ikon rocks,"Toaster works perfectly and looks great. No complaints. It has a nice bagel feature that toasts the inside of the bagel more than the outside. The slots are nice and wide. The only drawback is that it stays illuminated whenever it is plugged in, so it uses standby power. In order to not waste power and emit unnecessary greenhouse gases, I unplug it whenever I'm not using it. The manufacturer recommends this."
2,nice toaster..lousy warranty,"This is a very nice toaster. BUT, the power went out and when it came on the toaster did not work. Only thing in the house (home protected by a whole house surge protector)that had a problem.I called Breville and was told the warranty did not cover power outages."
3,Breville 4 Slice Toaster Review,"For $100 its definitely overpriced. It toasts more on the bottom 1/2 of the bread and does not have a 1 slice option, but then again, I can't find one that does. Overall, not much better at toasting than a much cheaper one. But as for looks it's the best... stainless exterior and a really sharp countdown timer. If it did a better job it would be a 5 star. You can do a great job if you watch closly and invert the bread before its done."
1,Very disappointed,We bought this toaster two weeks ago and finally decided to return it after trying and failing to get the correct settings. Quite frustrating in the mornings when your bread is either not even browned or burnt black.
1,aweful,"We have owned this toaster for around 9 months, it has frustrated us for the same amount of time, and I just had the pleasure of throwing it away. The 'timer' mechanism is too sensitive to be useful, and the spring loaded release is so mechanical that it's no surprise the metal racks snapped."
2,Overpriced. Looks Good but Doesn't Toast Well. Broke in a year and a half.,"This toaster was expensive, yet I bought it because it LOOKED good and high-end. Toasting takes a very long time; just look inside, the filaments are cheap and few. Also, the lever stopped working (won't stay down) after a year and a half. It is out of warranty, so no choice but to throw it away."
2,Breville Toaster,"I've had this toaster for several years. Today, it finally broke, and I am happy. I have never liked this toaster because it didn't toast bread evenly. Only 2/3 of the bread was toasted. To get even toasting, I was forced to set it to 2, then flip the bread upside down and repeat. The problem was the way the heating elements were wound or mounted inside. There were blank spots along the corners. I have a feeling that if I picked another Breville toaster off the shelf, that it would be wound correctly. I should have returned this toaster long ago. So now, I have to buy another toaster. And, guess what? I refuse to buy one on-line again. If I cannot see the heating elements inside -- in person -- I will not buy the toaster."
3,Bland Patti,"There are some good songs, but as a whole this record is pretty blah. I like 1,2,3,5,and 9 and the rest is pretty dispensible. Another record for die hards, but that happens to a lot of good artists such as patti"
2,OK but not great.,"Despite a wide angle of view, it is narrow if you want accuracy for photo editing. There is a slight color variation across the screen. This is because color changes depending on the angle you are viewing the screen. Many AGP display cards will not support this resolution, and hard to know until you try it. Most PCIe display cards will. I have also used the LaCie 319 and 321 which are better for digital photography. This display is OK for not so critical color work."
4,"its a fun read, dont read much into it","this book is not a look into the life of a hobo. its just a story of one trip and his views from it. its a good quick read if you are a tramp or hobo, even if just at heart."
3,Started Out Great But..,"I loved the way the book started. It had great potential, but then he began to sound as if he were writing from examples he read in Kerouac 101. I wish it would have been a little better, but it was still a good beach read."
3,Longwood 5-pc place setting,"I debated between purchasing the ""Longwood"" 5-pc place settings or the ""Longwood II"" 65-piece stainless flatware set for 12. After much thought, I decided to spring for the individual place settings hoping that the pieces had more definition (like the picture). Unfortunately, I'm not sure that the quality is any better for this item than what you would get for the set, and the set is much less expensive. I do think that the flatware is shiny, feels heavy and washes well. However, it doesn't look like the picture. It has less shape and appears flatter than pictured. Bottom line, I am disappointed in the looks of this flatware. It wasn't what I was hoping for, but it is a more modern looking pattern than my old R&B French County. We are using it, but I decided to cut my losses at 10 place settings, instead of completing the set."
4,Best daily scrubber,"My husband and I both use this as our daily face wash. I have sensitive skin and this doesn't not irritate my skin as some exfoliants do. My husband has oily skin (more than mine) and it doesn't aggravate it.This is the best scrub, but only gave it four stars since it is a bit more expensive. But, I keep buying it because it is worth every penny."
4,dvd,"was having a very hard time locating this movie until i looked on Amazon. why i bother with anywhere else, i will never know.thanx to all who buy and sell on Amazon"
5,Great!,"Ever since I got out of the military, I have been having trouble sleeping uninterrupted through the night. I play this CD on shuffle as I sleep and I cannot believe how deeply I sleep now! I have never owned a new age CD before this one, but it has definately turned me on to the genre."
2,"service was great, condoms not as great","these aren't as ""snug"" as I was hoping for. If you're in need of a condom for your guy that's on the smaller side, these are not the ones."
1,Tight?,"The product is billed as tight and providing a snugger fit. I found these loose. Although at 12 for $0.99, this is a real steal. You can get 84 for $7.92...Amazon sells packs of 60 Durex's for the same price."
5,Excellent book for novice chess players,"My 7 year old son is taking chess class after school. The chess book is an excellent book for a child or an adult who is learning to play chess for the first time. The book provides clear instructions and provides the designated moves for each piece (queen, king, bishop etc). The best feature of the book is that the strategic moves of the game are well illustrated on the chess board in color page-by-page with simple instructions. This helps the reader clearly visualize how to think through his/her strategy to win the game. You will not be disappointed with this book! I highly recommend Daniel King's chess book!"
3,Careful!,"Before ordering this product, be careful that the description matches the plate design. I've had numerous problems with a mismatch between stock numbers, description and patterns. I love Corelle, fabulous plates, but double check your order against Corelle's website!"
2,Not The Greatest.,"I suppose some people who are into DBZ will like any tape that comes out but this one was just kind of boring. The action wasn't the best and the villian just wasn't as threatening as some of the others you have seen on DBZ. This was lacking the normal DBZ content where you get to really know characters, Garlic Jr. was just proved to be annoying. Even when Vegita was fighting in the Saiyan Saga you had to say ""He's pretty cool..."" or like with Freeza you just hated him so much you wanted him to die but with Garlic Jr it's just boring."
4,Garlic back again?,"well if youve ever watched the movie special ""Dead Zone"" then you know who garlic jr is because i think Akira wanted to add a litte something extra to kill time or otherwise. well basically galic comes back and tried to take the guardian status away from Kami. of cource thats where our young hero Gohan and Krillin comes in. its rather good as far as the DBZ episodes go. if you own any previous ones, then you should own this one. actually you gotta like DBZ enough to own any of its DVD episodes so be sure you catch this one"
1,Bleh...,"Well...here we are with the second volume of a 10-episode arc that really serves no purpose to the plot of the series. It's not present in the comics, Goku's not present, all of the heroes seem a lot weaker than they should be...there's a lot wrong with these episodes, but I won't get into everything here. Suffice it to say that they really aren't worth watching in Japanese, let alone English. While the later Afterlife Tournament has some redeeming qualities despite its plot holes, these episodes just reek of filler pointlessness.You're better off just skipping to the Trunks episodes. Preferably on DVD."
1,Awful,"Just about the most awful CD player I've ever owned. The neat thing about mine is that none of the buttons (stop, play, fwd) do what you want. They randomly do whatever they feel like. Sometimes FWD will change the MODE, i have to hit the STOP button about 10 times to get it to stop, otherwise it ADVANCES the track. Eesh. I wish I had never bought this thing."
2,Disappointed,"I have been using Quicken products for around 5 years I am get more and more disappointed with the later versions. This product seems to have a lot of bugs:1, I could not successfully import some business records from another version of quicken 2, If another window partially covers quicken then you cannot get to quicken by clicking on it (you have to minimise the other window) - STRANGE 3, It has a lot of annoying adverts which I find offensive considering the fact that I paid $ for this product. 4, There is horrendous support for this product. The booklet tells you that you will be billed $ per minute for support calls)I have spent the last 4 hours trying to get my records updated.If you are a new user then things may work out fine (the user interface is generally good). If you are using home, business and a lot of investing then this product still leaves a lot to be desired. I was trying to work out how to set up a client but that does not seem to be mentioned."
2,"Nice program, but...","This is a wonderful program which performs MOST everything I require...BUT, there are (as is usual) occasional bugs or problems (like all software) and Customer Service at Intuit is probably one of the least responsive I have ever seen. Usually this isn't a problem (as I said, it's a very good program), but even a small bug in your accounting program can have severe consequences, and without a decent Customer Service Dept. you can end up with a financial disaster unless you pay close attention."
5,Some Really Great Stuff,"The absolute BEST Classic Rock band that rarely gets played bylocal radio. Fortunately satellite radio let me hear them againafter years without, so I bought this CD and love it.This is just the tip of the iceberg for W A, but a good place to start.I was fortunate to see Andy Powell and the current line-up liverecently...WOW!I can't believe they are not more well known,the musicianship from all four players was outstanding. Theycontinue to release new material and tour. Seeing them in asmall theater is just a wonderful night of quality rock music.I enjoyed them more than the Stones, U2 and others. Get someWishbone Ash, you will not regret it."
4,Great book for grandparents to give grandchildren,"This is a well thought out book, which draws out answers from anyone who wants to share their history with their grandchildren but doesn't really know where to start. It sparks memories and has such a friendly format, both for the writer and the reader. We bought both of them-the one for Grandmas as well as the one for Grandpas-both very good."
3,Not sure what the brouhaha is about...,"This is a serviceable tribute to the music of Evanescence. If it does nothing else, it cuts past the bombast and multi-layered over-production of the original works and allows the listener to appreciate these songs for their lyrical power. And these *are* some fantastic lyrics. The singer presented here does a good job projecting the inherent emotion. I suppose I'm just not sure what people were expecting from a Goth Acoustic tribute..."
1,This is a TRIBUTE...,"I'm a total Evanescence fan and buy anything that has to do with the band CD-wise. So I'm in Sam Goody one day, see this, buy it, and listen to it at home. To start out with, what the hell is with the offbeatness in My Immortal?!!! Its like it changes ever freakin' 5 seconds! The singer can't sing these songs for the life of her, although I think the extra added songs at the end she sang well, not great, but well. Like I said in my title, how can they call this a tribut? Honestly, any person starting out on Evanescence SHOULD NOT BUY THIS CD!!!! It will turn you off of the band forever if you haven't heard Amy Lee singing the songs that SHE originally sang. DON'T. BUY. THIS. CD. EVER."
2,too small,much smaller than other benches on same pages viewed product. i returned the bench for a credit . THe sizes were not clear.
5,Different but wonderful,"Although the band took on a very different sound for their second album, the brilliant writing and clever two-chord melodies still make the band fun to listen to. The change in pace from upbeat songs, to angry songs, to songs of infatuation etc are a perfect blend of ups and downs for a 36 minute workout on the treadmill. I highly recommend this album. A word of warning to those who are stuck within the realm of the first album, they sound like two completely different bands. I love each equally but you have to take the new as it is without trying to make the band what they were on the self titled album, things change, life always moves forward. It would be like yearning for Sheryl Crow's new album to be just like Terri Clark's self titled, the are just two seperate worlds."
1,Still waiting,Ordered it 5 weeks ago and still haven't got it. I had to put in 1 star to get the review through.
5,Near and Dear to my Heart,I love this book so much I am reading it again. Still sad such a great and witty author is no longer with us (hitchhiked to an another dimension?....well one never knows) and I'm still hoping for the sequel to the movie!!
3,Having A Hard Time Staying Interested,"I started reading this book about 3 months ago based on all of the great reviews. I am usually reading about 2 to 3 books at at time. But I am less than 1/3 of the way through it, and I just cannot maintain any interest in this book. Maybe later, I will sit down and try to finish. There is just so much more stuff out there that is more entertaining."
3,"Nice, light hearted sci-fi trip.","I could've given it 4 or 5 stars, I guess, its a well written, cute little book. but I just finished Enders Games, Dune, and Foundation , and this isn't even in the same league as those classics."
4,Great Read!,"""Ford, you're turning into a penguin. Stop it."" That is straight off of a shirt one of my friends made. Oh and straight out of the book. She told me it was a great book and to read it. So I did. I would highly recommend this book to anybody and everybody. Which I do. It makes me laugh out loud most of the time. I spent a whole cruise reading it because I liked it so much. Arthur just seems like the dullest person ever, but by the end, you can't help but love him. And Ford is his friend who always flies by the seat of his pants which makes him another character that everyone can relate to. And the rest of the characters, well they are all really quirky too. So if you have the opportunity, you should definitely read this book."
2,What's so funny?,"The first book in this series is quite good and definitely should be read. I had to force myself to finish the quite lame second book. The third book was just as good as the first. By the fourth book, things get VERY boring, VERY quickly. In fact, I could only read a few chapters of it before I couldn't stand it any longer and stopped reading. ""Oh, you just have no sense of humor!"" you might say. No. I've read, seen, heard, and written things funnier and more entertaining than this. ""Oh, you just don't understand British comedy!"" you might now say. No. I love Red Dwarf (My favorite TV show) and Monty Python and the Holy Grail (My favorite movie). ""Oh, you just don't appreciate wacky random humor!"" you might say. No. I love Sam & Max, the funniest book I've ever read and funniest game I've ever played. ""Then"", you might ask, ""why don't you like The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy?"" The answer is: I don't know. I just don't think it's funny. And I think I'm alone."
2,Never liked this series,"I'm sure this is one of those books that you either love or hate. I just can't get into the humor. The quality of the writing is of course good and if you like Adam's stype them you'll fidn this book a 5*. For me the story is infantile and just not funny. I'd rate the story 1* but in fairness I know it is more a matter of taste, hence 2* to reflect the fact that it is well written."
5,So Long Mr. Adams and thanks for all the fish...,"The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide is the ultimate collection for all Douglas Adams fans. I was shocked to find out that he passed away from an untimely death on May 11th, 2001. As he travels that undiscovered country with a copy of the Hitchhiker's Guide and a towel, Mr. Adams will be greatly missed by this fan."
3,Won't be recommending it,This is a ranking for the collection. The first book was good. Funny. Seemed unfinished. The second was ok. You get the point of all the irony by then. The third one I decided not to suffer through. I gave up (for the first time in my life on fiction) about 58% through.
2,Great Music For Your Pancakes,"The sound is a mix between Seals & Croft and Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young. However, it lacks the edgy ballads of CSN&Y. It's more like the pop syrup of S&C."
3,Good Harmonies - Too Much Sounds Alike,"Per other reviews here, yes I understand the CSN references - (""I Can't Remember"", ""Think It Over"") circa their eponymous 1977 album.I was hoping for the best - as I think all are talented in their own right (especially Matthew Sweet). But there isn't enough individuality to the songs. There is almost no single vocal on the tracks - w/accompanying harmonies. All the songs are are multi-part harmony for the lead vocals, which makes many of the songs blend together and sound the same.I am sure this was the project they intended, but alternating lead vocals and then some w/all three would have been a better blend in my mind.Overall, it's still better than most records, but I don't believe it lived up to it's potential."
4,Worth another listen!,"I have been a long time Matthew Sweet fan, his CD Girlfriend is one of my all time favorites, so when I saw The Thorns CD at Best Buy for $9.99, I said ""why not?"" and picked it up.The initial listen revealed pleasant and harmonic songs, not easy listening, per se, but easy enough to pop in to the car stereo and go for a drive and not feel the need to turn the music down to talk to people. It was pleasant and I want to say unobtrusive, which is not a bad thing at all.I put the cd away for a while and recently returned to it, and I swear it's like an entirely new CD, the songs I was comofrtable listening to before have now taken on depth and weight, and really to prove to be great music. After initially listening to them, and then not listening to them for a few months, I can't forgive that lapse! If you are a fan of any of these guys, or looking for the latter day Crosby Stills & Nash, give the Thorns a try, you won't be disappointed!"
3,"Mullins, Sweet and Drodge","Well first off, the best song by far is their cover of the Jayhawks' ""Blue,"" their voices bring new life to that Alternative Nation relic. And if there's nothing off here as immediately likable as Mullins' Hit ""Lullabye"" there's still many treasures to be savored. Like the Mullins/Drodge and two other guys' song ""No Blue Sky,"" a folkie track with great hooks and orchestral accompaniment to boot. Something tells me Matthew had a big hand in the creation of the gem ""Long, SWEET, Summer Night,"" which is great both as a song and as an act of self-promotion. So even if you thought ""I Can't Remember"" was a tad too saccharine, there is still much pleasure to be had."
3,Aw Shucks!!,"Man, I really love Matthew Sweet's output over the years. Shawn Mullins is okay, I guess...and I have Droge's 2 CDs - pretty good - kinda a Tom Petty vibe. I was so awaiting the release of this disc - such high hopes!! Alas, after 5 or 6 spins, it amounts to alot of ear candy with little substance. So sad. I REALLY wanted to love this attempt - watered-down CS&N cum Matthew Sweet - just doesn't cut it. Matthew, stick to your solo stuff and working with the criminally over-looked Velvet Crush - there lies your true strengths. Nice try, I guess. I would have rated this 2 stars, but Matthew Sweet could arrange and sing the phone book and I'd say it was, at the very least, good."
4,Pretty Good,"I recently saw The Thorns open for The Jayhawks and had few expectations. How could three front men/guitarists join forces and put something coherent and melodic together? Well, they did. The harmony is eerily similar to Crosby, Stills, & Nash (& Young). Even Matthew Sweet looks like Neil Young these days.The CD is not spectacular, but is there ever potential! These guys harmonize so well together and Matthew Sweet plays everything with strings on it (laptop, euchalele, 12-string). They are talented, and they came together well. If you like acoustic music and/or CS&N-type music, BUY this album."
2,Not What I Hoped For.,"If you are a fan of the ""power pop"" genre then don't expect to find it here. I've been a long time fan of Matthew Sweet and a moderate fan of Shawn Mullins but this does not come close to their past accomplishments. The harmonies are nice but nice is about it. Save your money or invest in some past CD's of Matthew Sweet instead. He's the real talent here anyway."
2,SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!,"I bought this concert 3 months ago. It sucks! First of all there's no Maurice (NUF SED)! How can you sing songs like, LovesHoliday, After the love is gone, September... without Maurice?YOU CAN'T! I've been a huge fan since 76, their best concert on dvd, is still the one from 81, when they had all their original members. Save yourself some money, don't buy this concert!"
2,Good idea but wobbly,Takes little space when put away - so that is great! But it does not always stay open. It is a bit awkward to use and is not stable in the sink.
4,"A Little Big, but Works. Easy to Clean, Easy to Store.","This was definitely a good buy. It is a little big, but it definitely does it's job. It's stands well in the kitchen sink. It's easy to pour your vegetables, noodles, etc, back into a bowl. It's very easy to clean and, of course, super easy to store."
5,perfect for me,"This was perfect for me, I can put it in the dishwasher partially folded so it takes up very little space. It also stands a little higher on its legs in the sink than my previous colander. Which is great because the garbage disposal protective rubber flaps dont always let the water drain as fast as I pour it through for pasta with a regular colander. It is pretty much your regular colander except that you can make it stand higher and take up less space in your cupboard...perfect for me...I bought two."
3,Be Careful...,"This snowblower starts amazingly easily and seems to work better than I thought it would for all situations except for one...If you get snow that packs easily, snow will pack around the cheap little lawnmower wheel on the left side of this thing.This wouldn't be such a bad thing, except that there's a part of the snowblower that protrudes out from the left side of the machine (I believe it's a cover for where the belt is?) and leaves only 1/4"" of clearance around the tire. So the tire binds up frequently when it gets snow packed on it. You can see in the picture of this unit exactly how little room there is around the tire. I would recommend a better designed unit, but it DOES work in most situations."
2,Disappointed,I bought the Yard Machine 140 model on December 8th. From day one I had problems with the machine throwing snow. Today December 30th I attempted to throw 3 inches of snow that arrived in the Detroit area and it failed miserablely. I took it back to the Meijer Store where I obtain a refund and I am shopping for another brand.
1,Way over-priced.,"In my estimation the machine is over-priced by $200. Also, I have to use starting fluid before it fires; I'm talking 25 degree weather!"
4,Solid...,This isn't a documentary that breaks a lot of new ground but it is solid and interesting. Recommended for those new to the topic.
4,"Easy to handle, but short on words.","I still have to use my larger dictionary from time to time, but this is so much easier to handle."
4,Very useful,Very effective for quick corrections or references without having to reach for reading glasses. The price was reasonable and your service excellent.
5,The Final Confrontation,"Namek's final 5 minutes really get going in this tape. Everyone on Namek except for Frieza and Goku are transported to Earth, so the two superpowers go all-out. Unfortunately, the tape ends with Frieza in pieces, so you have to wait for the next tape to see what happens to him."
5,Sasuke Lover,Okay.... I am not going to tell you about the book.... As the above comments already have.... I am just going to tell you.... That being 19 years old.... I love Naruto.... This is a great book.... The graphics are cool.... And it is a simple read.... I read this book in 15 min at least.... But because I love to read.... It would take me that long.... But I did read it again today (I got the book yesterday) and I took a longer period of time to read it.... And again.... It is an awesome book.... A suited book for all Naruto fans....Suggestion: Get Volumes 1-5 before jumping to Volume 6....
1,Repetive and not helpful,"This is not a particularly helpful book. It is repetitive, and, as another reviewer noted the overall philosophy of the author is that if your class was just more interesting and challenging, you wouldn't have any problems."
1,Pseudo Scientific Rubish,"This books is clearly nothing less than pseudo-scientific claptrap. It is however certainly worth the read. Of interest only in light of its place in history and its influence on the Nazis, Wagner, etc. Gobineau makes the same foolish errors common to those who THINK they are applying the scientific method and his errors simply multiply; he stops only when he is convinced he has proved a premise he already believed true. This is like a text book of phrenology or animal magnetism. What amazes and saddens me is (looking at the other reviews) how many modern readers are considering this as worthy of serious consideration. I'm assuming they have appointments to get the bumps on their heads read by a phrenologist soon too!!"
5,Non stop chewers,I have two extremely active Jack Russell mix dogs that make it impossible for me to find toys that they don't tear up in record time. These sticks are tightly woven and give them a whole day of entertainment. Thelma and Louise get one every rainy day to keep them busy in lieu of running in and out of their doggie door. So far the best chew roll I have found!

5,Great Product,Received the USB cables fairly quickly and they worked flawlessly.The price was great for the cables as well..
4,Sacred ...,"Return to Grand Canyon is a beautiful sacred album. It'll transport to spiritual and sacred zone. The tracks ""Return to Grand Canyon"" and ""Flight of the Condor"" are awesome. But, wait until you hear ""Kaibab Forest"": it is perfect, it couldn't have been done any better. It'll force you to close you eyes and make a connection with your higher consciousness and mother nature. I recently made a trip to the Canyon country in Utah and listened to this album while driving through the narrow and steep canyons. The effect was magical and I had to pull over frequently, close my eyes and submerge in the sacred zone.However, some of the end tracks towards in the CD don't fare well as compared to the first three. They seem like fillers and repeats. This is the only reason for a four star rating.This album is not an easy listening album. It qualifies as a sacred, spiritual and healing album."
2,not what I expected,"Read the back of the book first and then start from the beginning! Seeds of Fire has nothing of what it promises to the reader. I was thoroughly dissappointed and am sorry I was taken in by the title. Seeds of Fire took me six months to get through because it was not at all about China and the Attack on America, it was about Tiananmen Square! I give this book a YAWN! Tianamen Square is an interesting subject yet I did not bargain for it. Don't buy it unless you want to know about the assault on China's citizens by it own communist government. VERY SAD!"
4,I danced the night away!,"I recieved this book and in a few hours had devoured its contents. It's A Lot Like Dancing is not a book on Aikido techniques and does not teach techiques. What it does is give you insight into the attitude and depth of the art known as Aikido. I am glad to have gotten this book it has filled in some gaps of my knowledge of the Art of Aikido and how to proceed from here. Aikido is based on love and centeredness, that message is but a few Terry Dobson has taught the many who were privy to his siminars and classes. I wished I would have had the opportunity to meet Terry Dobson."
1,SO DISAPPOINTED,"I would never buy these boots again for my husband. Within a few weeks the shoestrings broke, within a month one of the top eyelets broke off...within the second month another top eyelet broke off. I wanted to send them back but my husband wouldn't let me. Thought I was getting a good deal - well, they are less expensive and made like a pair of boots from Payless. NEVER will buy these again!! Only gave one star because of Amazon's fast shipping."
1,Not upto wolverine standards.,I got the boots and they were all scratched and missing one of the top clasps. Was able to send them back and get a new pair. The new pair arrived in good shape but in less than 3 days two of the clasps on the right boot came off. I've only owned wolverine boots for the past 10 years and this is the first pair of such poor quality.
1,Great sound - No video - Not fully informed,"The Trio Italiano plays well with sensitivity, but you will not see them in this disc sad to say. It is an audio disc only. Unfortunately, nothing in the sales material prepares you for that situation.The DVD sound is very clean, and the separation and presence of the three players are beautifully accomplished, but the disc has been misrepresent- ed in the advertisement.One more bit of information to search for when planning to purchase a DVD based on computer information only. How do you know what you are buying when the full information is not made known to the prospective buyer!"
4,Looking forward to the next one,I have read too many disappointing books. It was refreshing to pick up a really great detective mystery - something different. The main character is interesting and worthy of another adventure. I have already picked up the second book and planning a great weekend with a good book and warm fire.
1,Not impressed.,I got it when my daughter learned how to ride a two wheeler thinking it would have some fun catchy songs.She listened to it once and hasn't wanted to listen to it again. It didn't grab my attention at all.I would recommend Laurie Berkner or Sandra Boynton (songs) any day. My kids will listen to those CD's over and over and I like them too.
4,Guilty Pleasure,It's sad that I listen to this more than my own kids but Justin can write a catchy quirky song. If Weird Al and James Taylor had a love child -- he'd be Justin Roberts.
3,Powerful but LOUD!,"Devilbiss generators are now Porter-Cables, and I bought the Devilbiss version at a closeout price. This piece of equipment really puts out the power, but unfortunately also puts out the decibels! I intend to put an enclosure, allowing air flow of course, around mine to make it tolerable. Also, the filler cap/dipstick is plastic and in my case, was crossthreaded when I bought it, and absolutely insisted on crossthreading every time it is removed. The crosshatch pattern on the stick catches oil on the case if it isn't put in straight, and then leads you to think it's full when it isn't. Get it going, though, and if you can stand the noise, it'll run a bunch of equipment."
5,Must have CD,I love this CD. It is probably my favorite to play in the car. If you like Ska you will love it. Even if you don't listen to ska but like up beat music you will more likely than not like it. I have had this CD for more than 10 years and I never get tired of it.
1,not what I expected,"As previous reviews state, there is NO clip, which is the reason I purchased it in the first place."
3,Not the rod I ordered,I ordered the Medium Light version of this rod but Amazon sent me the Medium Heavy. Returned the product. Rod looked OK but not what I wanted.
2,Yucky taste!,"I usually buy the Source Naturals brand of Melatonin spray, which has an orange taste. Since I always brush my teeth before bed (of course!) and the orange doesn't ""go"" with minty toothpaste, I thought I'd give this brand a try. While it does have some natural peppermint taste to it, there is an overriding other flavor that I can only describe as yucky. So much so, that it triggers my gag reflex. On top of that, I haven't been sleeping as well since using Nature's Plus Melatonin Spray. Oh well, back to orange flavored Source Naturals, which works great by the way."
5,Fresh,"Light, clean secent that keeps refreshing throughout the day. The liquid has a rich moisturizing texture and feels great on the skin."
2,Disappointed Griddle Owner,"I've had a lot of Coleman products through the years and have always been very happy with them. Times change! This griddle is made very poorly and something breaks on it each time I use it. The legs actually melted off when I cooked some bacon (not very much bacon either). The O-Ring needs replacing. You have to have a separate little velcro strap to keep the lid on for transporting. The legs are made so cheaply that you know they're going to break off soon, if they don't melt off first. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was the griddle surface was very nice and it seemed to heat evenly, otherwise very discouraged with this purchase and will no longer trust Coleman's reputation for decent camping gear. Shame on you Coleman!!"
3,Bella B,Pretty good product. Like the feel of it on my skin but did not work on what I needed it for very well.
3,so many things to teach?,"I wouldn't say ""so many"" but an average amount.This cd is ok but it does have some classics raid the barn ect...It is worth buying though!YO-GOW YO-GOW EMPRIE SALLES I JAH JAH is the only WAY......"
2,Another shoddy tool from China,Poorly made import from China - when will manufacturers ever learn? This pruner has PLATED blades and the plating is flaking off before I have even tried to use this thing. It's going straight back to Amazon. Let the Chinese buy this junk - I want quality.
5,A shower of thankfulness,"I recently purchased ""Thank Him For The Rain"" and was highly impressed by the musical talent and good solid content of the album. I thought the music was awesome, played by apparently just Dewayne and Leroy Williams. What a feat! it must have taken many pain-staking hours to get all of that done! And the positive message was aboslutely heart warming as I listened to it. These guys have really got a groove going, and something special to add to it-talent on loan from God. I think this album is definitely worth adding to your collection if you consider good, jiving music with a positive upbeat message your thing! And if not, try it out jsut for kicks, you might find a new style of music you love!"
2,Product was/is not 100% quality,"Well, where do I begin?This phone was given by myself as a present to a dear friend of mine. Text messages are often never received nor sent by this phone to other phones. Also, the phone will be closed in attempted to be dissconnected from a recent phone call - however, more than a few times the phone will not disconnect the call, as if it is still connected to the last caller. At this point the battery must be completely removed and the phone restarted.Also, the phone will randomly say ""please insert SIM card"" when the SIM card is already inserted into the phone...All in all i was very dissapointed by the money i paid - a very high amount for a cell phone. THe phone has already been in the shop once - and my friend has only had it since christmas."
2,Made poorly..,"The phone worked for its purpose. It was a prop. Unfortunately, some of the parts of the phone were falling off of the phone immediately after taking out of delivery box. Not put together well. Obviously a cheap product that has been mass produced. Not worth the $100.00 I bought it for. Not sure about the return policy.. so they may be good about that but since it wasn't my money... I didn't get too disappointed about it."
2,"Looks good, but...","This phone sucks. The software is slow, especially when the phone is loaded with lots of pictures. The buttons are clumsy to push, especially if you have big fingers. Ergonomically you would do better with an older model Motorola cellphone. The buttons on the side are laid out in a manner that when you handle the phone you frequently tend to change the ringer to off inadverdently. That is a real design boo boo.The RF section is, however, pretty sensitive and stacks up well against any other phone in terms of talk distance and reception.Don't waste your money."
1,Get another phone !!!,"I had this phone for about two months. It has the worst user interface of any phone I have owned. It was obviously designed by some engineer without any notion of what phone users really want to do. After 2 months, when I couldn't get it to redial a phone number I had just called, I took a hammer to it. As one reviewer said, the two happiest days you have with this phone are when you buy it and when you get rid of it !!! I'll never buy a motorola phone again. I only gave it one star because I couldn't give it zero !"
5,Great old TV!,It was really nice to see some ad breaks and commercials included in this series! Superb example of the golden age of television.
5,One of the best CD's I have ever bought well worth the money,This CD is packed with great songs from cover to cover. This CD is a must have for all Alternative Fans.
1,Piece of garbage,"Fan fins self destructed. Worked for a couple of months, then noticed my laptop getting really hot, the fans weren't running, then discovered some of the fins broken. It's not like they are accessable to physical damage. Avoid Vantec products unless you have money to waste."
2,A Creaky Western Saga,"It's hard to believe this 1931 relic won the Academy Award for Best Picture. Wesley Ruggles' clumsy production of Edna Ferber's ""Cimarron"" survives only as a curio. The western saga opens with a rehash of the Oklahoma land-rush sequence from William S. Hart's 1925 classic ""Tumbleweeds"" and goes downhill fast. Richard Dix's cartoonish portrayal belongs in the School of Bad Acting, but Irene Dunne makes the most of her first starring role. In retrospect, ""Cimarron"" might have worked better as a silent film."
1,Dead batteries,"I want everybody to know that this company is shipping dead NIKON EN-EL1 batteries for Nikon Coolpix E5700, E8700, etc. Don't get decived with this company. I ordered two of them. They look to be really Nikon original parts (at least all Nikon labels are there and provided manual is from Nikon). However, my original does not accept these batteries and starts flashing rapidly, whereas my old batteries charge perfectly. I measured the batteries voltage, and it is accurately 0V. Both batteries are dead."
4,Pleasantville and far ahead,"This Swedish band makes their debut at Dusty records with this great album ""In the middle of nowhere"".16 good songs with threads down to Steve Earle, Georgia Satellites, Del-Lords, Neil Young etc.It's a mix of power-rock n roll added with a spice of country.The opener ""The war"" sets the speed that keeps the rock n roll spirit high.""Blue nights"" find it's way to your heart with its good chorus.The track ""Out in the light"" shines with guitars that will make Neil Young jealous.Track 11 ""The rocking truth"" is a smooth small-town tale taking you to an unknown place back in the 70:s, rolling like thunder down the road.The album is a strong choice of songs and not one is falling out.The lead guitarist/songwriter & singer has made another statement in his solo album ""Ove Wulff ""tale of the scorpio""also on Dusty records. I strongly recommend that one for the lovers of decent rock n roll with a touch of country twang."
2,"Some nice features, but for LIGHT use only","This is a fine tool for very light use. Unfortunately, most of the tasks you use a garden knife for are anything but light duty. After losing my many-years old hori hori knife, I thought I'd try this, mainly due to the price. On the plus side, the grip is comfortable, and the notched point is a nice feature. However, the build quality is not at all suitable to the things I want to use a garden knife for, such as prying out major weeds, dislodging rocks, sawing small roots, and dividing dense perennial clumps, etc. The blade is very thin and it is not securely attached to the handle. Returned it and went for a more sturdy knife (AM Leonard brand) that works much better (albeit at a higher cost). This knife would be fine for very light use in light soil. It won't survive anything else."
1,Great tool while it remains in one piece.,"I bought one of these 4 years ago, and loved it. The blade looked to be decent steel with a very glossy/shiny mirror-like finish. Under heavy prying I'd occasionally feel it start to flex, and would back off before damaging the tool. After 4 years, I finally wore it out. So, I happily ordered a replacement in summer 2010. When I received it, I immediately noticed the difference in appearance. The blade had a freckled/frosty finish. It appeared to be a different alloy. The second time I used the new version of the tool, while applying much less pressure than the first one would consistantly withstand, it snapped in two. Broke cleanly at the weld between blade and handle. It's a shame they have become so fragile, the blade size and comfort of the handle were perfect for me."
3,Garden Knife,This Garden Knife is sharpe but I broke the handle off the first time I used it so just becareful when digging I am getting it fix somewheres but light soil it is good but hard soil not reconmended
5,Short and sweet,"A great book for those looking to get started on a healthy diet. This diet may not appeal to those looking for a complex multi-step diet, but it's simplicity is the reason that I was able to find success and get my eating under control. Yes the book does mention the bars several times, but they are called Raw Crunch bars and the book is named ""The Raw Crunch Diet""! They are kind of important! She also tells you to just substitute any bar you like for them (although I have yet to find a raw bar that can compare)."
3,Maybe it's my age.,"Alright, maybe being mid 40's it's not my style. Believe me. A lot of goofy stuff in the 70-80's with friends and I. But not for TV. And some of this isn't humor, they are idiots. My two cents."
2,Not Elite,Littermaid Elite is not so great. For the price I am still scooping out.Takes too long too sccop out and does not scoop out everything. I have a small dog and by the time the rake starts working the dog has already gotten into the box. Rake should be made longer to scoop out everything.
5,Solid board,"Beautiful finish, fast shipping. Rides pretty well too. Keep in mind this is my first board so I probably couldn't talk definitively to it's ride quality. I enjoy it. Gets me down the Strand great."
2,Non Fiction,"Introduction to Mechanics by D. Kleppner is pretty much a garden variety mathematics textbook. Not one you really want to have unless someone makes you get it at some time or other. Not interesting or useful enough to keep unless you have to.Not that brilliantly written, interesting, or informative enough to be anything other than inflicted upon people."
4,Fun but not flashy,Purchased this for my son whose original smart cycle cartridge was lost in our recent move. He (5) and his brother (3) both enjoy playing. Somehow manages to for hold his interest even though he also got a wii for Christmas.
4,Great fun for my four year old,My 4 year old son loves his smart cycle and this game is by far his favorite. The graphics aren't especially good but it doesn't matter to the age group for which it was designed. Even my older children (6 and 8) like to take turns. I would recommend this product to any budding gamer especially for the exercise and educational value.
2,TO BE OR NOT TO BE A FAN,"I HAD WAITED A LONG TIME FOR THIS MOVIE TO COME OUT, BUT UNFORTUNALY I WAS DISAPOINTED AFTER PURCHASING AND WATCHING IT. NOT BECAUSE OF THE MOVIE PLOT OR THE WELL-DERSERVED-OSCAR-WINNING PERFORMANCE OF BETTE BAVIS,BUT BECAUSE THE COPY OF THE FILM(I KNOW IT IS VERY OLD) WAS VERY DAMAGED AND SCRATCHED , BUT I COULDN'T HELP LOVING IT BEING A FAN OF HER WORK AS I AM. AND IF YOU ARE TOO, I'LL TELL YOU: GO FOR IT!BUT IF YOU ARE NOT THAT MUCH OF A FAN,DON'T GET IT!"
2,dual impression,"5 star photos, 3 star descriptions, 2 stars organizer and 1 star paper format and usabilityHORRIBLE logical organization (strange for scientists, as shown in authors)ACCURATE descriptionsMAYBE good kids choiceBAD, uncomfortable paper format makes it hard in useREALLY nice and clear quality photos!As for me - only photographer executed work heartfelt, other worked for a mark and money, without love.Dual, ambiguous impression, good example, when commerce kills love to science and professionalism."
5,Thriller,"This is a wonderfully patriotic movie. Believe everyone should watch this movie and be thankful they live in a free country, America. This is also a thriller for we were on the edge of our seats waiting to see what would happen at the end. Didn't expect the ending which made it even a greater movie. Highly recommend this movie. Paul Lukas was excellent and although we don't really care for Davis, she portrayed his wife with feeling. Her mother was a much loved,typical mother. She could be very subtle yet very concerned re: her son's life. Loved the three children and wish all children were as well-behaved and intelligent. So glad this was in a DVD format for I had it on my wish list for a couple of years with the VHS version and hoped it would eventually be a DVD."
3,"Fun taxi, but beware small parts","My three year old likes it, but the tires on the taxi are real rubber and they can come off which could pose a choking hazard for kids that still put things in their mouth or those that have younger siblings in the home."
1,"Poor quality, poor packaging.","The candlesticks were packaged tightly in a taped up plastic bag, one already broken (had to have been broken before packaged).Did not come packaged in box as described. Excess glue (white) and clear coat was all around base. These were a gift for the next day so I glued the base back on myself. For the price I expected much better but it was too late for me to return them and get something else."
5,A real dandy,I purchased this notebook for my 6 yr old grandson Eli for Christmas. He has carried it around nonstop ever since. The toy is well made and he has drawn on it and cleaned it countless times with little sign of wear. Not only was this toy his absolute favorite gift this year but we are already planning to purchase another one for his little girlfriend for Valentines day. We are both very pleased with the purchase and would recommend it to any Blue's Clues fan.
4,"good, but could be warmer","I work in a lumber yard, and after a long day of milling wood i like to warm my back with king-sized moist heat. it works well. i wish it got more warm, warmer or hotter. i apply menthol sports cream also. i wear it for about three hours."
4,A pretty good collection of Electronica,"Among the highlights: Moby whith an exellent piece, Goldie does Bush in a great way, Agent Provocateour, Massive Attack and some more.The downsides: What does Poison do here? I am getting a little tired of the Prodigy, to be honest. There are also 1 or 2 more weak links in this cd.Overall: a very good collection of (undancable) electronica, with an atmosphere too. There are many styles and moods in this cd (Ani Difranco on one side of the scale, Agent P on the other), but who says you have to have one style?Bottom line: I find myself listening to this one a lot of times."
2,"Nice idea, poor execution","It is nice to see a product that has had a lot of thought put into its design and funtion. It is a shame to manufacture the product so poorly. First, the suction feature does not do anything. Second, this only worked twice. After I used it twice, the 'rechargeable' battery died and would not recharge. Its a shame that they went with such a cheap, crappy battery that it renders the product useless. The two times I did use this the results were great."
5,Fabulous!!!!,I was absolutely stoked when my boots arrived! The picture does them no justice! My friends are soooo jealous! I love them they are Fabulous!!!! Thank you...we will trade again for sure! :D
3,it'll make you laugh,"in this film tenchi finds out that he's a father and the news has some interesting results on the rest of the masaki household, but it is mainly ryoko who is more annoyed with tenchi's daughter mayuka. this film has some interesting moments and is a film definetly for fans of the tenchi series"
3,"Pretty good, but missing it's other half","A pretty good movie for any hard core Tenchi Muyo! fan, but it really doesn't compare to the television series. It has it's ups and downs let's just say. I thought it was unusual that throughout the whole movie they were talking about Christmas, because it was set in the middle of summer! But I did like that this one hardly had any nudidy in it. Good fighting scenes, and I think Tenchi was hitting on Ryoko. 3 stars."
4,Not as excellent as the others,"This is an OK movie. However out of the three movies I'd have to say this one would be the worst. Don't go thinking this is a bad movie it's just that the other movies were longer and more interesting. This movie had it's moments but the plot was pretty predictable. The two characters Mayuka and Yuzuha were alright, but there not the best. As far as the original characters go Tenchi and Ryoko are the only one's with decent roles in this movie. Ayeka and Sasami don't really get involved in the situation till the end. All the others are just minor characters as usual. OK backround music, but could have been better. I mainly gave this movie 4 stars just because of how long it was. So there are only a few bad things about this movie. So if your a Tenchi fan I recommend this."
5,Tenchi Forever,"This movie is a great sequal. It has new characters, and which one of them is tenchi's daughter and a demon who loves tenchi's grandfather. And this demon has nothing but revenge on her mind for what the jurai family did to her on summer startica on planet jurai. When you watch this movie get ready for some action and thrills."
2,Hmmm...,"I want to like this book, I really do. I'd never read anything by Calvino before and bought this on the basis of the reviews and - mainly - the intriguing title. I browsed the first chapter in the book store (as Calvino describes!) and was intrigued, but then... gee, maybe it's just me, but did it get bogged down or what!?I've made a start on it two or three times. Each time I've picked it up with a tremendous sense of anticipation and each time I've got to about page 40 or so before putting it down with a terrible sense of disappointment. I feel it should be saying something to me, but isn't. What am I missing? I'll return to it again sometime, honest, but, until then, I get the horrible suspicion that it might be one of those books that just aren't meant for me. Still, I hope to get back to you in six months' time with better news (and more stars!)."
2,You can find better,"I really wanted to like this novel. After all, Umberto Eco had recommended it in one of his essays (but that was before I read Queen Loana and quit trusting him as well). It's a novel approach at story-telling, but that's about it.Ultimately, If on a winter's night a traveler lands on me as a monument to navel gazing. Who would ponder that deeply about reading when they could just read instead? And what of the concept that being a writer had spoiled reading? I don't know any musicians who hate listening to music. It is all so much wordplay and not much else.As to the numerous claims by the novel itself, and by many reviewers here, that you - the reader! - are the main protagonist: BS. The novel was written 30 years ago and you aren't going to change it."
3,Unimaginative...,"Key to the book? The text of the chapters are of no consequence whatsover. Simply read the titles of the chapters, one after each other. It forms a poem. It is is the true message of the book."
4,Joe Walsh-The Definitive Collection,"What can you say. Classic Joe Walsh in a way that only he could make happen. From his early days to today, this is an album for any die hard Joe Walsh fan. His varied styles of music is sensational from the raw early 70's sound combined with 90's production techniques makes this a great bit of work. If Joe's style of music is your cup of tea, then I highly recommend this album. Great collection of classic Joe Walsh."
3,"""Turn To Stone"" Track Is Not The Version I Remember","I have two problems with this otherwise ""complete"" hits compilation:(1) The ""Turn To Stone"" version on this CD is not the version I grew up with. You can play the sample link in Amazon's track listing and hear the very obvious difference. I never heard this version before and definitely would prefer to have the version I grew up with.(2) My other complaint is ""At the Station"" is not included. All my other Joe Walsh favorites are here, plus two I wasn't familiar with (""Tend My Garden"" and ""Midnight Man""). I think ""At the Station"" would have been a better choice than either of those two other songs."
5,FANTASTIC jewelry cleaner,"Do not waste your money on any other jewelry cleaner! This little cleaner is AMAZING! I barely recognized my diamonds after cleaning them! Carousel hooks hold rings nicely as well as pendants, also comes with a hook that has holes where you can place earrings. I have cleaned my engagement ring, diamond studs, and journey pendant so far and I am amazed! This was meant to be a sort of ""pre soak"" to a much more expensive ""professional"" cleaner I also purchased. I am now regretting buying the professional cleaner because this one is FAR superior to the professional ones! Although it is only battery operated, it is very powerful! I'll admit i was skeptical of it at first, but WOW!!! I would recommend this cleaner to everyone!"
5,Very good deal and product,Awesome product at a competitive price. I searched many websites before settling with Amazon.com. This was exactly what I was looking for and installation was a breeze on my 2011 Sierra. These look fantastic on the truck. I did view a video on install before I purchased and I did not need a breaking bar to loosen the body bolts. I had them installed in one hour and I absolutely love them. Would recommend this product to anyone looking for nerf bars. The three inch are just right.
4,Pretty good...,"I really like the pattern of the water jets. The lights illuminate not only the waters, but the ceiling also. My only complaint is that the pump gets loud if the water level drops just a minor amount (<1/4""). But, I use it every night when I sleep, and it provides a wonderful white noise."
4,"Great game, but grand prix mode too easy.","I bought a Game Cube because I heard this game came out. I was a HUGE fan of the original.I'm not an expert racing player by any means. The play and graphics are amazing, but after getting the hang of the tracks, I was able to win every GP race in this game in a few hours. I like the concept of the All Star series, but they need to make the GP mode a little more challenging."
5,Mario Kart Wii has come out. Can how does this game compare?,"If you read the title question the answer is amazing! Although the Wii version has the steering wheel and motorbikes, if you dont mind having only 16 courses (4 unlockable) and using the Gamecube controller then your set! works great on Wii and having 2 riders makes it even more fun. Not to mention Co-op racing. You can have 2 players on the same Kart switching between thrower and driver at will in the middle of a race. Another thing this has that the Wii doesnt is special items. You make your karts 2 riders a good team by their special items (yosh= big egg, mario= fireballs). I perfer Gamecube myself.Then you've got the bonus disk. 1st off its not about Mario Kart. its got demos for games like Star Wars ouge Squadron III: Rebel Strike and Mario Party 5 and videos from other games. The bonus disk is nice, but i wouldnt pay more for it alone.In the end, you'll be satisflyed if you buy this."
4,Mario Kart Double Dash w/Bonus Disc Review,"This is an awesome game. It is the only racing game I like , so this is a good game to have even if you don't typically like racing games. The only problem I had with it is that it is exactly like every other Mario Kart game. If you have any of the other ones then play that and don't waste your money."
5,A childhood favorite!,"This is a Rankin/Bass classic and one of my favorite Easter specials. The use of the Mailman character from ""Santa Claus is Comin' to Town"" creates a wonderful link between the holidays. I easpecially love how all of the Easter traditions are explained in such a whimsical manner!"
4,"A little long, but innocent Easter fun","The newer release is amazingly bright, and the sound is clear. The story itself is a little tired, but stronger than some of the other Rankin/Bass releases. Almost all of the songs are memorably strong though, which is what matters. The explanations for common Easter traditions are altered to adhere to the film's plot. Which is probably for the best, considering their combination of two drastically different beliefs. For 50 minutes however, it does feel a little long-winded. By about the 37th minute or so, you'd believe the special would be concluding. Perhaps it has to do with the complexity of trying to balance the two villains? Still, an acceptable special that would make great fun for the younger ones around Easter time."
3,I wish my boss would pay,"Im a body tech, fix wrecked cars, good bit, dulls fast but last long enogh to do one quarter panel or one hss frame rail. ok product dulls faster then you would think for the price. use slow speed drill, burns up in seconds at 2000 rpm and above."
4,"The Key Word is ""Mini""","This is a slick little product. The light source is absolutely perfect for slide viewing. However, since the image is not magnified in any way, you may want to invest in a high quality magnifying glass if you need to view it any larger than actual size. I did have some difficulty extracting slides from the slot, since when fully inserted the edge of the slide is flush with the top edge of the unit. Since my hands are large and I don't have fingernails to grab a hold of the slide once it's in place, I wound up putting a few fingerprints on some of the transparencies in my efforts to extract the slides from the Mini. I found that I needed to pull forward on the top of the slide in order to have any edge at all to grab on to. The plastic cover for the ""screen"" can also be a little bit difficult to slide off. Other than these ergonomic issues, this is an outstanding piece of equipment that is just what you need to review slides, alone or passing them around the table!"
4,"Right place, wrong century","This book takes an interesting look at the intersection of space and time. Jeb Stuart and his cavalry unit are conducting an operation at Gettysburg, PA in July 0f 1863. Passing through a mysterious cloud they find themselves in Gettysburg, PA in 1963 during the celebration of the Battle of Gettysburg. The soldiers have to deal with modern devices and a populace unlike anything they've encountered before. All told, an enjoyable read."
2,Necessary Evil,"I have used this devise extensively and it is definately required for tele-3X converters, macro, registration/animation shots. I'm using a Nikon 995 and without it the above photos would have been degraded without its useage. A necessary item. However, the flip side is that some evil designer, who should be demoted, only allowed for a 2 minute min. interval. Not 1 min, 30, 10, 5 sec's DUH! In addition the plug is really small, unplugs readily (even when you don't want to) and the cord is really short,with no extensions available. In addition, the USB port that accepts this devise has worn rather quickly for a Nikon, with connection becoming erractic if at all. The camera is presently in repair for replacement of the port/connector. I think that NIKON should issue some sort of incentive for those who bought this accessory. Its a love/hate relationship."
3,Forensic psychology meets the little hairs on your neck!,"Although R. Markham seems to overplay his role in the forensic process (and why wouldn't he- after all the book is about his profiling and expert testimony), this one is a thriller if for no other reason than it is a nonfictional account of some of the goriest and most horrific crimes committed in the US in this century. If you have a taste for the macabre, here's your chance to learn about famous chaps like Manson, and lessor known bloaks, like the Vampire of Sacramento, and Norris and Bittaker."
3,Quite an average collection for Plympton...,"I have to say that I was a bit disappointed by this book. I've come to expect very witty visual humour from the mind of Plympton, as in his animations.. this small compilation lacked in almost ALL artistic skill, eschewing that for shots of verbal double entendres and small vulgarities. I laughed at a few pages, but they were definitely few - the simpler the images are (the less distraction by the poor drawing quality), the funnier they seemed to be. Notable are Arch Nemeses and Henry David Thoreau... aside from that, as time passes and his illustrations are from later and later in his carreer, they DO improve and become much funnier. Start at the back of this book and work your way forward...."
2,Unreliable.,"The radio link on mine failed after 6 months, although each half tests normally by itself. I confirmed the batteries are good, codes match, etc.It's disappointing that something as important as a water alarm would be built sloppily. This unit is made in China, which may explain the quality problem.Nice design, when it works. We'll see if the replacement holds up any better."
3,"Good basics, but slightly out of date","I was at first disappointed to discover that the book I had just purchased was 12 years old. So some of the terminology no longer is in use and some theories have been either refuted or more warmly embraced by the TG community in the years since this book was published. New theories have emerged that were not even discussed in this book, understandably.However, her methodology and findings appear to be quite sound and have stood the test of time. Some ideas she proposes, which may have been unique or relatively fresh at the time, have now come to be common knowledge or understanding.However, so much of what is in this book exists in greater detail in other, more updated books. I would recommend this for those wanting a comparative look back in time, but I believe more current publications would be much more beneficial to most readers."
3,Interesting case studies,"This book includes interesting narratives from librarians in a variety of jobs outside of the traditional library. However, the book predates the explosion of technology and the Internet, so it doesn't really touch on MLS grads working in computer-related jobs. The book includes 62 personal case studies and is divided into the following sections: (1) publishers, writers, booksellers, reviewers, (2) products and services for libraries, (3) independent librarians, (4) independent librarians with companies of their own, (5) association work and work in the academic world, (6) librarians employed in the corporate world, (7) some librarians who have traveled farther afield (includes private investigator, archivist, etc)."
5,Just what I needed.,I bought a heart rate monitor that is worn like a wrist watch but I wanted to mount it on my bike. I bought this and it worked perfectly to attach the monitor to it.
4,Mildred Peirce DVD,"Shipped quickly, DVD in good shape and a good price. The DVD case looked cheap and there was no documentation inside.This is one of Joan Crawford's classic movies.Carol Burnett spooffed this movie on her TV Show."
5,Joan Crawford's best film,Crawford definitely deserved the Academy Award that she won for this role. It's a depressing film but well-acted and has a sharp and well-paced storyline. I highly recommend it.
1,Ms. Crawford at her best! but the dvd was a defect.,I never seen Joan Crawford do any better than this. I will not say any more. See her for yourself. Now the Problem: The dvd stopped less then half way through & it is headed for the land fill. Defect!
5,Mildred Pierce DVD used-purchase,I ordered the black&white DVD of Mildred Pierce. It arrived exactly as it was described in the ad. Packaging was fine and it arrived earlier than I had anticipated. The DVD was in great condition after I played it....it was like brand new. Thank you!.
5,Joan Crawford Classic,This is one of my favorite movies from Mrs. Crawford. I saw this movie on TCM but they didnt sell it. Found it on Amazon. DVD was in perfect condition and delivery was quick and easy. Will buy more classics from same vendor.
3,Actually is not very sharp.,"I bought 2 sets, one for my Dad & one for myself, after use few time is not sharp anymore, that's why cost so cheap for 3 knifes!"
3,a good debut,"This is great for a debut album... For the rap-rock genre, this was one of the better ones. Like a cross between Rage Against the machine and (Aenima era) Tool. DBL was definitely the album on which Schwabb truly found his more unique and fitting vocal style. But the lyrics on this album, just like all Project 86 albums, are thought provoking and brutally honest."
1,Terrible,Took the EZ-DUB out of the box and plugged it in for the first time. The lights came on and it worked for about a minute and a half before it made a buzzing sound and stopped working. So disappointing. It's a brick now. The lights won't even come on.
4,Great Eighties French Pop,"This CD is a great example of French Eighties Pop, as in, sugar-bubble-gummy and very sweet. After the first five songs, you begin to think that people in France are high all the time. The CD is very good, however, and it has a certain je ne sais pas quoi. Overall, it's very good."
5,"Rie Tanaka (Chii) Sings Haunting Chobits 2nd Ending Theme Song, ""Ningyo Hime"" (""Mermaid Princess"")","In episode 14 ""Chi Entertains"" on the Chobits - Love Defined (Vol. 4) DVD, the beautiful but sad second ending theme song for Chobits, ""Ningyo Hime"" (""Mermaid Princess""), is heard for the first time in the series, sung superbly by the Japanese voice actor (seiyuu) for Chii (Chi), Rie Tanaka. Rie Tanaka's Chii from Chobits won Newtype Japan's annual favorite female anime character poll for 2002. Rie Tanaka's Lacus Clyne from Gundam Seed and Gundam Seed Destiny won Newtype Japan's annual favorite female character poll for 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006..."
4,NFL: Moment of Impact,"I purchased NFL: Moment of Impact as a gift for a young man. It has been such a hit that I wish I could find more DVD's of other years. If anyone has that success, please let me know."
4,Lots of Big Hits,"This DVD was great if you're looking for those big hits. I've watched quite a few of these NFL Networks productions recently so you do see some of the same things as in other DVD's, but I do like this one. Well worth the $$."
3,Nice protector,This device is a nice protector for my SanDisk. The only thing that would make it even better is if there was some sort of armband attachment I could use at the gym.
4,My 2 year old LOVES it!!!!!!,"My son has tons of fun with this toy. His sister got a karaoke machine for Christmas so I thought he should have a similar toy. He never even messed with ""sissy's toy"". He was too busy with his. He loves to hear his voice in the mic and he has picked up on some of the tunes and his letter and number recognition. He is learning but is totally clueless because it's fun. Love It!!!!!!"
2,Eh....,This toy would be easier to use if the microphone was on a stretchable cord and didn't require the button to be constantly pressed for the microphone to function. The cord is only about 3/4 foot long. I'm disappointed in this toy
2,Gave to my 2 yr old nephew,"I gave this product to my two yr old nephew, he was not too excited about it. It is really cute, but does not have many songs to chose from. He cought onto it right away and liked to speak into the microphone, however, it moves/rocks when you play a song and it kind of freaked him out. He played with it for about two minutes before he was on to something else. Maybe it was all the Christmas toys? It is cute."
3,Not what I expected,"My daughter loves music so I thought a toy that lets her sing along and hear herself would be a hit. She does like to play with it but the songs are really fast and not easy to sing with. Also, when she sings into the microphone the sound is really distorted. Luckily she still likes to play with it but honestly I was expecting more."
1,Poor Lighting,"Not only is the mirror itself quite small -- the usable portion is 4 1/4 inches in diameter -- but the lighting is horrid. There is not enough light to illuminate one's face and what light there is creates a glare. I don't even bother to turn the light on anymore.A month after receiving this as a present, I was out looking for another one."
2,Nice while it lasted.,"Had one installed for a year before it started making little chirpy noises. Replaced battery, cleaned sensor, nothing helped. Before it died it did work though.Remote sensor is very handy: mount the alarm up where you can see and easily test it, while the sensor lives under the sink, behind the washer, etcetera.Did like the battery test button. Some detectors don't have any way to test or tell you the battery is dead. It's like the smoke detector problem, where you mount them in out of the way places then tend to forget about them and the batteries die, leaving you unprotected.There are plenty of other devices like this on the market, so no reason to put up with this one.This very same device is also sold under the Little Giant brand."
2,Poor design,"This water alarm is poorly designed. The suction cup is pretty much useless (it won't stick to anything), and the test button is so exposed that it constantly gets pressed when the device is in my tool bag. Since the device doesn't have a protective case to carry it in, there is no way to guard the button from getting pressed. Of course, if your alarm will be permanently installed somewhere (like in a water heater closet), then these design flaws won't matter to you.Oh well, for the price, I guess I shouldn't expect much."
3,Does the job of detecting water but wish it was louder,"This little alarm is a smart idea if you get water in your basement, like I do, but with the basement door shut you can hardly hear the alarm when it goes off. If you live in a loud house or have a business this is probably not the alarm for you"
1,Sonin water Alarm - Failed to work 1 minute after using,"Sonin water Alarm - Failed to work 1 minute after usin.Ooperated long enough to test it out, then started a low buzz noise and never alarmed again after multiple trys,including replacing battery.I can not recomend, seller refused any contact or replacement.jeff Clausius@leantrak.com"
3,not loud enough,product works as stated - but is not as loud as I'd like.Hard to hear the product in the basement when on the first floor with the TV at a moderate level - can't hear it at all from the second floorI purchased 3 different products wanting to compare and find a good warning device and all are about the same - bottom line is its better than nothing but far from optimalReliance Controls THP205 Sump Pump Alarm and Flood Alert - RelianceSonin 00700 Water Alarm with Remote Sensor - by SoninZircon 64003 Water Detector with Leak Alert -by Zircon
4,Man vs. Machine,"A story about one man and one berserker, out in the middle of space, fighting to the death (if a machine can be killed). If you are a Berserker fan, this is a book you have to have."
5,Hard workout!,This workout is a killer! Definitely gives me lots of room for improvement. I like workout videos that are hard at first so I can see my progress. I consider myself in really good shape.
5,Tests You're Endurance,"This is the first workout tape I've done with Bob Harper. I'm a huge Jillian fan, but she just doesnt work you out long enough. I also do a lot of Beach Body workouts, like P90x and Insanity. I was just looking for something different to add to my workouts.It really tests your limits. There were so many squats!!! It was surprisingly similar to Jillian's Kettlebell workout, but much more difficult because of the length of time. Keep in mind it was similar but different. It seems the same concept was there.Anyway, overall, a great workout!"
4,Long but effective,"Another great workout from Bob Harper. Definitely not for a beginner but not as hard as his other cardio workout ""Ultimate Cardio Body"" but still intense to make a seasoned exerciser stop a minute. My only issue is the length; 62 minutes of intense workout is not easy. By the 40 minute mark, I am so exhausted I am ready to be done. However I must add that after 40 mins, you feel like you just got a great workout."
2,Boring,"I love to workout using fitness DVD's cause I am always pressed for time so I consider myself a bit of a connoisseur when it comes to these kind of workouts. I got this one because I like to watch the Biggest Loser and I have always been a fan of Jillian Michaels' exercise DVD's, but this one felt stale. There was nothing new or different about this workout. The trailer is much better than the actual DVD. I would recommend Tony Horton's P90x instead."
5,Must Have,This is the first bob harper dvd I bought and don't regret a single penny spent. I love it. I couldn't get through the entire dvd the first try and now I do but it still gets me sweating and out of breath every time! Go for it if you desire a challenge for an at home workout!
1,How Bad Does Your Writing Have to be...,"before they take your typewriter away?I am confused and unsettled by the tide of opinion that rises against me regarding this novel. It is easily one of the bottom ten worst books I have ever read. The writing was worse than amateurish. The characters, all of them, were unlikeable, but especially Cassidy, who is a dwid of the first order. The plot was ripped directly from yesterday's news , long after authentic Satanism and recovered memories were generally accepted to be overrated phenomena by the pyschiatric community.And yet. And yet. I read all these positive reviews and I can't help but wonder: am I the one who's wrong here?Nah."
1,NOT SUITABLE FOR MOST APPLICATIONS,"This sensor is not a replacement for the factory speed sensor, nor can it be modified to be used in place of it. This is strictly an aftermarket part for non street vehicles using an actual speedometer cable. The return policy at Amazon.com is very limited (15 days) and by the time I figured all of this out it was too late to return it. Also, the part specifies it must be used with the Painless wiring harness for the fuel injection. Bottom line here is that if you are just trying to fix your street car it's worthless! Strictly for competition use is what my mechanic says! (Will not pass smog test either I'm told). Suggest you do not buy!!"
2,Kiva Key Chain Convertible pack,"I ordered three of these (three different colors). The product seems good enough, but the company sent me 2 of the packs and one arm sling. They got the order wrong. Don't know if it is worth the trouble to try and get them to fix this."
1,Usually love Kiva but not this one,"I have about a dozen of the Kiva foldable keychain shopper bags, which I love, but I was very disappointed in the backpack. The straps are not only thin and fragile, they come loose from the buckles constantly, even when knotted, rendering the backpack useless."
3,"good story, wrong metal","i really liked the story, but parts of it conflicted with an earlier book, The Kagonesti. according to The Kagonesti, at 3811 PC, the elves had steel axe-heads, plate mail, swords, daggers, and arrow-heads. and the humans were allied with the elves to defeat the dragons. and balif was leading an expedition east to expand the elven territories. if anyone would lead a western expansion, it would seem to be quithas, who is absent in this book. also, according to The Dragons, the humans also had steel. the only race that used bronze was the ogres. this dragon duranix's existence also conflicts with The Dragons. overall, a good story, but it conflicts with the back story too much. 3 stars for the story."
5,So Much in a Small Package,"This is my 1st MP3 player. After extensive research of what was out there I settled on the U2 because of it's listed feature of clarity in it's vocal recording and the added benefit of in-line recording. I am a singer in a 4-part Acapella quartet (Sweet Adelines International) and needed a device for rehearsal purposes and this little MP3 player does it all. So far, I have recorded from tapes into the MP3 player, recorded our rehearsal and assigned individual tracks for each song which I later burned on to a CD for each member to listen to. The playback quality is phenomenal as you can hear the resonance and pitch in our voices.I would encourage anyone to get this great MP3 as it was easy and fun to use."
2,"If it works, don't mess with it!","I bought this unit back in March. It has worked great. I decided to upgrade the firmware as the newer versions claimed to offer some ""bug"" fixes and benefits. This was a costly mistake.I consider myself pretty computer literate. Although part of the directions were a little bit vague it didn't sound complicated. There's really no reason for updates like this to be difficult. Well, either I did something wrong or the upgrade failed because I now have no music player. It won't turn on and my computer no longer recognizes that the U2 is even connected. I've tried every single tip/trick I can find... nothing works. I'm not even going to try iAudio/Cowon support because a quick check of online sources finds everyone saying the same thing... they're useless and a waste of time.I bought this player based on many good reviews. It worked very well up to this point. My only advice... if it works, don't mess with it. I did and it cost me my player."
3,Not my favorite but good all the same,"Compared to the iPod Shuffle the iAudio, for almost the same price, is exceptional. The display gives you plenty of detail, unlike the iPod Shuffle which has no display. If you only have a hundred or so to spend, this player is a good choice, but the only I really wanted to get is the iAudio 30GB player."
1,Difficult,"I bought this for my granddaughter, and I have used 3 other mp3 players, and this one is horrible. Getting 2 different computers to recognize it was impossible. Hello, this is 2006, this stuff should just plug and play, I thought I was back to DOS, and I am pretty computer savvy. Anyway, save yourself and get an Apple, Dell or Phillips. WOW!"
2,Gloria Vanderbilt Book of Collage,"I enjoyed previous books on the life of Gloria Vanderbilt and was interested in her creative work. I can appreciate her creativity, but find this work sentimental, unsophisticated and outdated for my interests. That is just personal, and believe others may find something they enjoy here. Glad to sell my copy if someone wants it. Marilyn"
1,It ain't water resistant,"bought one of these, plenty of light, mountable anywhere on the grill, but do not leave it out on the grill. The directions lead me to beleive it was weatherproof and therefore could hack the environment. After about two rain showers, Poof!So, if you get one, take it off the grill and put it in the house between uses, and don't use if in a rainy situation."
4,bar-b que light,"I see the light.when i use the grill,now I know if the meat is rare or what.great item no power needed"
5,Great Opera from a 14 year old,"I have enjoyed Charlette Church from her beginnings as a 13 year old opera singer until her later teens. Sadly she is no longer using her god given talent but then that seems to happen to young super stars who earn their fame and fortune to early and without guidance. So for several years she mesmurized the opera world and sang with some of the greatest names and met some of the world's greatest leaders. Now she is just another ""POP"" singer with a lot of dreams that don't seem to be going anywhere. Perhaps when her children begin to ask those ""what ever happened to you"" questions she may give opera another try - this time from an adult frame of mind. MK"
1,Not Funny,I Love Saturday Night Live but this DVD was a total waste of money. We ended up forwarding through every skit.
3,Not working properly,"I've bought several Sandisk products in the past and have always been pleased until now. The reader seems defective as it keeps dismounting itself from the desktop and when the computer does recognize it, it can't find the images, saying they are corrupted files. Would like this replaced or refunded."
2,Ramps came without proper mounting gear multiple times.,"Ordered this ramp to load my harley on the truck but package didnt come with proper mounting gear to combine ramps. Thought it might be just unlucky and returned it for a replacement ramp, same problem second package. Both ramps look great but why have two ramps that you cannot use together."
5,Brilliant work,"I fortunately stumbled on this in Aberdeen and couldn't put it down on my trip home. Absolutely one of the most dark, yet brilliant books I've ever read. It's ending ranks as one of the all time greats (and shame on those who would ruin it!). Serious readers should pull up a footstool, pour a cup of tea and settle in for a most uncomfortable and interesting journey through the mind of a young serial killer."
4,A twisted tale guaranteed to give the reader the creeps,"Seems like readers either hate or love The Wasp Factory by Iain Banks. Written in the early 80's, The Wasp Factory reveals the first person narrative of a teen-aged serial killer, Frank Cauldhame, who never gets caught (that's not a spoiler; the reader is aware from the start that the teenager's murders have never been traced back to him).Using bizarre religious ceremony and imaginative contraptions, Frank has an insatiable appetite for killing rodents and insects. He sees nothing wrong with blowing up rabbits or incinerating wasps, yet is appalled when his brother, who is equally psychotic, burns dogs alive. After a few chapters, the dark humor and hypocrisy of Frank's evil habits are amusing.The Wasp Factory is a twisted tale guaranteed to give the reader the creeps, but also a chuckle or two. It's also less than 200 pages, so it makes for a good afternoon of reading a complete story."
1,The writing is brilliant the subject is horrifying.,"First I would like to say that I am sensitive about children and animals, so had I not read this to appease a friend, I would have stopped reading after the second page. The writing itself is amazing. The author draws you in immediately and has some very funny lines like ""I'm not sure the wind is blameless either."" But the ending is rushed and never explains the gaps in the story. There is no reason for this book to exisit; it is pointless. It is 99 percent animal and human destruction, followed by a few pages that reveal a twist. Nothing is explained, no reason for the animal torture and cruelty, let alone the killing of three children. It made me as nauseous as when I watched Pink Floyd the Wall. If you don't like insanity, torture, animal abuse and bad storytelling, don't read this."
1,I wish I could give this book 0 stars,"This book is clearly intended to launch the author into fame-through-controversy by pushing people's buttons in a gross and meaningless way. The story has no redeeming value and deals with topics that are just disgusting. I read this book entirely because I wanted to understand the title, but now I wish I had read some reviews warning me away from it. I can understand causing a ruckus to make a point, or trying to offend to draw attention to a cause, but this book has no purpose or message behind it other than to offend.I find it unfortunate that so many people give this book 4 or 5 stars, since disgusting topics do not a worthwhile book make."
3,intriguing but ultimately incoherent,"This is an entertaining look into a pretty bent mind, with some nice vivid and bizarre imagery. What kept me reading, though, was not just the bentness or the imagery in itself, but the sense that Banks knew what he was doing, that it was all going to come together in the end and add up to something greater. It didn't. There's no particular insight at the end, no new ground broken, just an attempt to sort of sum everything up in terms of a single annoying little contrivance. This made me look back at the rest of the book and see it as fairly shallow and sensationalistic, however arresting some of the scenes are in themselves. I should also note that anyone who thinks this book is really out there or mind-blowing or whatever probably has never read Thomas Pynchon."
5,A strange trip,"A strange trip for the mind, intense, provocative, challenging and even at times sickening. A short tour into paranoia, obsession, biology, social constructs and (im)morality."
4,Diary of a Psycho,"I definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys twisted stories and takes them for what they are. This book is not for everyone, there are graphic descriptions of death and such. If people read this book looking for a complete story with a happy ending that settles everything then they will be disappointed. However, if you read The Wasp Factory to enjoy a tale seen through the eyes of a teenage psycho and how he experiences the world you will be thoroughly entertained. It is a fairly short but entertaining read, and the ending is worth the wait. I would also recommend The Bridge by Iain Banks."
3,The PrintShop 11.0 Version,This new version is only worth buying if you want the new graphics. Those are nice to have but... If you want to print any specialized projects i.e. invitations or cards that are off size or if you want to print only one side of a two sided project forget it! This program only lets you do what it wants. Forget creativity or special needs! Wait for 12.0 and hope they get rid of the rigidity of this program.
5,Great CD,I owned this cd a long time ago and still love it to this very day.. Lots of great songs for the true dancehall fan
2,Has strange memory of previous weight reading,"I have been carefully monitoring my weight loss regimen with this scale. It has been frustrating because the scale seems to 'remember' the last weight (from the day before) and shows that instead of weighing me again. To thwart this, I grab a few books and weigh myself -- apparently this throws off the memory, because the next time I hop on the weight seems reasonable with my expectations.If someone could please explain to me why this scale is so weird and how I can program it to merely weigh the person who steps on it, then I would be truly appreciative."
2,Long-time user,"A lot of the comments written elsewhere are accurate. I have used my scale for 10 years now. Here are my observations:First, the scale does seem to remember the previous weight, so I need to weigh myself first by partially stepping on it before weighing myself for real.Second, once your weight gets high enough, it no longer measures in 0.1 lb intervals. It changes to 0.2 lb intervals. At a heavier weight, it changes to 0.5 lb intervals.Third, for me, the body fat percent is stable. I have never had a wild swing in that measure. At most 1%. This can be explained by my body fat being near the middle of the two values.Fourth, it reports a higher weight than you actually weigh, by about 10%.Fifth, I have experienced wild swings in weight (about 10%).Bottom line: I own this. It works well enough. I do not want to spend the money on another scale. If I knew then what I know now, I would not have bought it."
1,Useless,"Pros: looks cool, useful memory featuresCons: doesn't work. measurements were all over the place every day, and after a few weeks just stopped working altogether, tried changing batteries and everything."
1,What a scale??,This is the worst scale in the world. I thought I was getting a great deal on a scale but in the end I ended up wieghting 205 wow!!! I was very upset with this product and I would not tell anyone to buy this brand or type.
2,A/V CABLE NOT INCLUDED,"The shipment was extremely fast, but the Audio/Video cable was not included as is stated in the product description... There is not even a place for the cable in the small box this product comes in. Electronics Expo was good though, they are paying for the shipment back to them and refunding my money. I would rather have had the dock and cable though, as I've seen it work and it's a great docking station paired with the Elite reciever.."
1,are you kidding????,really? $340 for a piece of plastic that holds your ipod vertically? this costs more than my ipod!the cable that came with my VSX-94THX plugs right into the ipod and offers the same functionality. so a cable that bends 90 degrees with some plastic molded around it costs $340?????????????
3,No what I remember as a kid.,"I'm 33 and remember The Littlest Hobo from when I was a kid. I don't remember any of these. They look a lot older and the thyme song isn't the same as what I know: ""Maybe tomorrow you'll want to settle down. Until tomorrow I'll just keep moving on"". Happy I didn't pay a lot for this."
3,worth it,"It's not magical or anything, but it gets the job done and the extending handle is so helpful."
5,Great and funny!,Just the Gay Beer Commercial Parody alone is worthwhile this wonderful collection of Adam Sandler's best stuff. You can tell he's a great comedian and entertainer.
3,Not bad. Lot's of great stuff missing,"Incomplete!Despite the content in this DVD isn't bad at all, there is some other great stuff not included, like for example the saint patrick's day song, performed by Bono (A. Sandler's Bono, of course), or the sketch about the ""pepper boy"", which happens to be one of my favourites.Also, the extras in this DVD are just stills of the video itself!? Is this suposed to be joke? Not Funny!!!Anyways, if you do really enjoy Sandler's humor, you may feel dissapointed, not because of the choices included, but for those that were left aside. We need more in one DVD. Too damn short!!"
3,great comediant,"adam sandler is a great actor, comediant, guitar player, and I love all his movies, but I guess that this dvd has a lack of many other performance of sandler in SNL, but in spite of this, this is a great dvd"
3,Useful for beginners,"I am a student and found this book very useful in regards to the anesthesia equipment section. This section was succinct but covered all of the major concepts. There were several diagrams which were very useful, and helped me to understand and apply the basic concepts. The other sections of this book are not as useful but are also well written. This book has a lot of charts which are extremely useful for reference. In conclusion, this book has useful sections and is a good reference, but in my opinion will not serve as the sole anesthesia reference for veterinary students or practicioners."
2,Two star rating for a second class mission gear set,"Most of the equipment is out of scale for a 12"" GI-Joe. I was only able to use a few items out of the whole set. (Maybe a 3 3/4"" equipment set accidently got mixed-up with a 12"" equipment set) Besides the helmet, I believe the most ""obvious"" mistake was on the ""miniature"" ax and ""planting"" shovel. These were both too small & too thin. If anything else, these ""important"" engineer tools themselves could of rated this set in a higher catagory. I even would of bought a couple more sets, just for the tools. Instead sadly, most of the small pieces of this set went to my daughter's toy box. It was a shame to do that with a Hasbro product. More thought & detail could have gone into this Mission Gear set to make it a success. Learn from your mistakes R&D and let's make another Combat Engineer set, to 1/6th scale this time!"
5,Excellent Resource for Precise Internet Searching!!,I bought this book as a textbook for an Electronic Information Retrieval course at school. I have found that this is an excellent resource for anyone wanting to learn how to get more out of their Internet and Database searches. This is a must have for anyone needing to do research!!
5,Awesome,This book is the greatest ever. Jennie McGrady Mysteries are the best. Jennie is a good Christian role model.
2,so/so,"I'm a big fan of Japanese anime, but Akira and Steamboy are probably the least favorite anime movies I've seen. I guess I just don't care for this director.Steamboy was quite boring and you could turn your volume off for the last 1/2 of the movie and not miss much..""turn the shutoff valve, floor 2, get outta there"" etc. Maybe if I had an interest in steam engines it would have been more interesting."
4,Not your everyday anime.....,"I just watched this, and I must say it was very well done. It has great characters and good action. But, this is not very, oh, how should I put this, ""anime-ish."" At least, it doesn't feel like it to me. However, this is still a great movie that a fair amount of people will enjoy. I'd say rent it first. (BTW, first ""anime"" feature film for me.....I crave more!!!)"
4,An impressive sophomore effort...,"Overlong and uneven but with production this staggering it's useless to carp. Imaginative, insightful story-line is given emotional depth thanks to film's charming protagonist (well voiced by Anna Paquin) and Steve Jabonsky's rousing score. A must for animation enthusiasts and a welcome return from veteran anime/manga artist Otomo who is at the peak of his powers. This special Director's Cut edition is 14 minutes shorter than its original theatrical release."
4,Steamboy director's Cut,Movie Mangga .. ilove it. Like Akira so Steamboy. I buy it because looks good with bonus insert it. I hope someday Steamboy will be transfer into Blu-ray version.
2,Two defective tape measures in a row,"I've been a big fan of Oxo products for years, the kitchen is fairly well stocked with their good designs and quality. However, I've bought one of the 25' tape measures a couple months ago, and it quickly lost the ability to hold the tape in place when the button is clicked. After exchanging it for a new one, I had the same problem on the second day of use. I'm not quite sure that Oxo is as reliable and well built as Craftsman."
3,I purchased these DVD's,for a friend who wanted to have them so I have no idea what is contained within the footage. I have no desire to watch this series of movies.
2,Really boring.....snore,"As a historian I am drawn to the WW2 collections on DVD. This one appealed to me because it had vids I had not seen before. Well the classic Desert Victory and the Nazi Strike were classic as always. The three features Hitler's Britain, How Hitler Lost the War and Here is Germany were awful. The first side of the dvd was soooooo boring I ejected it after trying to find something redeeeming in the features. Just another note, the feature, the Spreading Holocaust, had little to do with the ""holocaust"" rather it's a mish mash from Pearl Harbor forward. Quite frankly this set is a waste of plastic. I've bought better material for a buck. So save your allowance and look elsewhere."
