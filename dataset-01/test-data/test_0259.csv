2,Dissapointing Wu-Album,"as it was written: Wu-Tang ain't nuthin to f... with.BUT this album was not good maybe 3 above average tracks and the rest are average and nothing special at all, not bad not good..."
2,straight wack,"Wu fell off, no doubt. Even wacker than the W. Perhaps 3 tracks is hot, the rest is jus commercial. If ya like mainstream, get it. 4 shaolin nigguz its poison."
2,NOT GREAT,This is not such a good album there was too much hype whene it was comming out but its not bad. Rza has tryed to produce a new wu tang on this album and it just does not work
2,like the Group Version of Nas,"alot of Promise at first but after a while&some decent songs&Side Projects but on a whole nothing to match the Hype.The Production&Beats are mainly by the Numbers to Me.the FLow has some moments but they are past there Creative Peak as far as I'm Concearned.they have had better days&alot of that is showing.it's never easy for a Group or Artist to Maintain a Level especially when you are on the Pulse&they were on that Pulse but only now they are a Logo at best.Ghostface,Meithoid Man,RZA,ODB&the Rest Of The Crew to Me seem like they have all but Broken up by the feel of this Disc."
1,Poor Choice,"There are all types of junk food, including junk food cookies, readily available in the stores. But why waste your time and energy making your own? This book is full of recipes featuring name-brand candies, and other name-brand products; that and the fact that the book has no author leads me to believe that the book is cleverly disguised ad for the candy industry. The book is full of very slick photography, but the recipes, with some exceptions, usually feature store bought candies and are really heavy on the sweets. If you need a way to get your kids to eat more sugar and processed food, this book might help. But if you want the exquisite delight of fresh baked, made from scratch, classic cookies, you'll find a few recipes in this book, but you'd be better off with some other choice."
4,okk,"Book was a bit more ""used"" and battered than I anticipated. Shipped right on time. Book itself is for school. Content is useful, but a bit try."
5,Very GOOD pocket Guide,"""Pocket Guide to Radiography"" served as one of my references for the ARRT examination along with ""The Ultimate Study Guide for the Registry Examination in Radiography: Key Review Questions and answers."" ""Pocket Guide to Radiography"" had all the information for the positioning portion of the test. The central ray, part position, and patient position are always described in a very descriptive but easy to comprehend fashion. The pictures are great and easy to follow. For awesome practice questions for the ARRT Examination, I also found ""The Ultimate Study Guide for the Registry Examination in Radiography: Key Review Questions and Answers"" to be a wonderful reference. These books helped me to pass the ARRT the 1st time I took it. For quick look-up of medical terms, I also found ""Dorland's Pocket Medical Dictionary Book"" quite practical and also excellent."
4,A student must,"The pocket guide is a must have for the radiography student. Pictures and explanations in a condensed version of Merrill's is portable and easy to use. The only complaint that I have is that it has too much space for recording information such as generator type, milliseconds used, and part thickness. As a beginning student in the real world, I am far more interested in image criteria, which is of far more value in determining whether or not a radiograph is good. Image criteria is NOT included in this guide, and there is little room to handwrite it on the pages as they are filled with the other information."
3,does the job,"I have had my saw for a couple years now and have not had a problem. Seems other people have had switch problems but mine has worked fine and I have gone through around 30 abrasive wheels. I was disapointed to find that milwaukee just stamped there name on a foriegn tool. This tool is not the quality I would expect from milwaukee, I think it is as good or better than any of the other entry level abrasive saws. If you want the best for your money I recomend milwaukees 6180-20, this is a nice saw. Another option is the dry cut saw which I'm upgradeing to but it is expensive."
1,Bad,"When it works it's good but it rarely works. IMHO the Panasonic KX-FL511 Sucks, ie paper jam issues and worse, paper feed issues. Their tech support is even worse. I will never buy another Panasonic product."
2,Poor service from panasonic for help,"I purchased this fax machine on 5/12/2010 from Amazon.com. It was the 2nd panasonic fax machine I have purchased. The last one lasted 4 yrs. This one is not as good and Panasonic tech support isnt very helpful. At first they blame my tele line, which is a joke. They don't seem to care to offer solutions, and some how they disconnect from the telephone when it suits them. If we dont get satisfaction soon, I will call American Express and stop payment or have charges reversed. Panasonic has to learn to be more customer friendly."
1,"Just refuses to send faxes - won't accept the paper, hangs up, etc.","We barely use this fax - not many of our customers use the technology anymore. But, when a customer does send a fax, we usually have no problem receiving it. The big problem starts when we have to send a fax. The machine just refuses to do it. It won't accept the paper. Or, it connects, then hangs up without actually taking the paper. To get it to work, you have to be prepared to dial over and over again and coax the thing to take one sheet of paper at a time. I dread it. And, I'm sure our customers tire of their phone ringing over and over again just to have our fax hang up or, at best, send one page, then hang up.I would NEVER recommend this fax machine to anyone. I would throw it out, but its a tough pill to swallow to spend $200 on a fax and then really never get more than $10 of use out of it. The cheaper fax this piece of junk replaced did a much better job.Every time I use this thing, I die a little inside."
4,replacement,I bought this to replace one that I had exactly like it. It works fine and arrived quickly and in great shape.
1,Lost interest while reading,"I was expecting this to be an actual story. I read about 5-8 chapters, of which were nothing but letters. I understand that the letters were to create the story; however, I lost interest in it."
3,old dialect,"Took some time to get used to the manner of speech. Charming otherwise. I am being asked to add more words, why?"
2,Not My Favorite Jane Austen,"I've read almost all of Jane Austen's books and this one wasn't enjoyable at all. I would suggest other novels (Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice, if you haven't read them) before this one, although you could read it in a couple hours."
3,Historical portrait of a narcissist!,"As I read this short work by Jane Austen, all I could think was that Lady Susan had Narcissistic Personality Disorder. It is a perfect case study. A selfish, cruel mother who takes pleasure in manipulating everyone for her own benefit, cares nothing for her own daughter, and seems to have little or any belief in love, either romantic or otherwise.I am amazed that Jane wrote this when she was so young. Such a brilliant mind, and such powers of observation. If you are a Jane Austen fan already, you will probably like this work, though not as much as the longer novels. It takes only about an hour and a half to read in its entirety. When compared with other authors, it is an entertaining book. I only give 3 stars, because it is too short for much character development. I wouldn't pay for it. Get it free on the Project Gutenberg website."
5,A Victorian Jersey Shore,"Who knew that Lady Austen was so very naughty? This book read just like a Victorian Jersey Shore. The story centers around Lady Susan. At first glance, she appears to be a harmless coquette, a flirty young widow misunderstood by jealous wives of friends. Soon, though, her true character emerges. Think of a truly evil femme fatale and you have the character of Lady Susan. She is trying to marry off her innocent daughter of 14 or so to some count of duke.....unless of course she can snag the man for herself. The whole time she is also trying to pull the wool over the eyes of her family and acquaintances so she can continue to enjoy their financial support.It isn't like a regular novel. The story is told through a series of letter, from and to various characters in the book. Austen occasionally does with her stories and I love to see the inside intrigues from various points of view.This was probably my favorite Austen of them all. I loved the absolute naughtiness of it!"
4,A Jane Austen Delight,"This short novel is in the same style as Austen's ""Love and Friendship"", told entirely through the correspondence of the characters. Rather than limiting the perspective, it leaves much of the characterization and insights up to the perceptions of the reader. The characters are well developed, considering the length, though the daughter could have been expanded. Lady Susan in particular is fiendishly detailed by Austen's satirical pen. This is a more blatant attack on the social foibles of her day than other works, but very enjoyable. I recommend this when you want a short novel with engaging characters and the usual excellence of Austen's narrative style. A true delight."
4,A little different from the usual Austen...,"This book was a pretty quick read, as it was both short and intriguing. The language style is like Austen's other works, but the actual story is a bit different. A majority of the book is written in the form of correspondence between the various characters, so the reader figures out the story as the characters do. It didn't have the same humor that Pride and Prejudice and her other bigger works contain, but it's still a good read."
3,For Austen Completists,"While not as good as her novels, it is a pleasant read if you already like Austen. Not a good introduction to the author though. I suggest start with Pride & Prejudice."
4,Hart introduces a new concept to literature,"I enjoyed reading ""The Athens Assignment."" Although I found room for improvement, this new author shows promise, I think. One thing I appreciated about the book was the total lack of violent language or explicit sex. The author seems to have enough confidence in his work that he doesn't feel the need to try and appeal to the darker side. I felt the story was well-crafted and the dialogue style appealed to me. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good, relaxing read."
3,Pacific bayview needs to use better quality innertubes.,"The bike is a nice looking bike. However, the tires say inflate up to 40lbs. At 20 lbs, both innertubes exploded. I called to get replacement tubes & they sent me a new bike that cost more to ship than the cost of the tubes. The replacement bike arrived & what do you know, the innertubes exploded again. Be ready to go out & buy better quality innertubes on your own. Oh, & w/ both bikes, the reflectors were broken & one wheel was bent."
3,"you get what you pay for. it's cheap, hey.","you cant expect miracles from a $120 w/shipping, bike. i have gotten 6 of these in the last year, and 3 have had bent front wheels. even IF the bend looks severe, because they're STEEL (not chrome), a bike shop can 'true' the wheel back stright, for $10.yes, pull those obnoxious orange decals off ASAP."
5,Great card for mid-level users w/out AGP,"This is an excellent card. When I first purchased it, I read some reviews about what a nightmare it was to install on Windows XP. I have a Gateway with onboard video and all I did was disable the onboard video, pop the card in and install the drivers from CD and had absolutely no problems. the card is stable and provides excellent 3d and 2d video for the price. If you are a mid-level user without any AGP slots, I highly recommend this card as it is probably the best you are going to get from PCI Bus"
3,It was O.K,"Well, the product I received was no the product that is shown in the description. I received an older version of Amino 2000. Even though it was well within its expiration date, I like to be given what I am sold. Also, 6 pills a day is a lot. I would suggest a powder."
1,Inu Yasha Rules,"I love this series but I hate the american dub. The DVD seems like a rip off to me with the small amount of eps and that price tag.If you get a chance: WATCH IT WITH SUBTITLES!!! The jokes make a lot more sense when they are in their Japanese entirety and not badly translated for an American twist. Watching the dub on CN was awful.. the voices are terrible, the scripts don't always make sence, and they make everyone talk like they were from old england instead of Japan. I seriously suggest watching this great series in subtitles. I think they should re-release these DVDs with only Japanese audio and correctly translated English subtitles.. then it would be cheaper and more worth your money. 120 episodes and 3 movies ^.^V so far."
4,Engaging Blue Collar Veiw of WWII,"Written in sparse prose, George Scanlon captures the everyday existence of the millions of GIs who served in noncombat roles. What comes thru on these pages is gamut of strange experiences a young man has in far away places in the midst of THE cataclysm of the 20th century.'Scanlon's War' is part of a genre that emerged in the 90s of personal 'ordinary man' accounts of WWII. This book belongs near the top of the list."
4,A good investment,"I am very pleased with this hamster cage that we bought for our daughter. It has a combination of wire bars and plastic that provide plenty of ventilation but also helps to contain the smell and the shavings. The hamster immediately loved the little room at the top for sleeping and I was concerned about it having a ""spin-about"" instead of a true wheel, but she runs on it every night. I've also read a lot of complaints toward water bottles, but we haven't had any issues with it. The cage is compatible with the tubes that go to Crittertrail and Safaritrail so there's lot of options to choose from. The only small complaint is that the tube rings that lock together are difficult to tighten and loosen for cleaning the cage. Otherwise we love it and more importantly our hamster seems to too!"
1,What a piece of junk,"Went straight from the box to the recycling bin since it was now too mangled to return. Nothing fit together properly so I had to resort to taping the plastic parts inorder to get them to hold their configuration long enough to line up with the base. Then the cage bars wouldn't slide into the plastic. I gave up and bought a Crittertrail system which went together like magic. The Habitrail system, however, is made of very thin plastic and is poorly engineered. I'll never buy another product from this line."
2,not illmatic,"Crap. I can't believe the MC that brought us illmatic could make something like this. The way Nas contradicts himself from song to song would make the WWF writers proud.Seriously, this album is not worth the money. If you want deep lyrical content cop Mr. Lif or Company Flow or Cannibal Ox, or Arsonists. This is just more of the same crap that the big record labels feed off as being intellectual and pseudo-underground. If you want the next Illmatic, I would suggest getting the Farewell Fondle Em record from def jux. If you want something more along the lines of puff daddy or any of that other over commercialized crap, then maybe you'll like this album."
4,It's still written,"Stillmatic isn't Illmatic. I think it's more like It Was Written. It's a little better than that though i think it really should have 4.5 stars. Well basicly i liked most of the trakcs. The one's i didn't like were Braveheart party. and Smokin'. I think the General should have gotten on this Cd. Worst Enemy of Rise and Fall would have helped to. if he doesn't try to go pop on the next one, i think he'll have regained his respect"
2,Over hyped....,"...Alot of people will have seen the 'Got Urself...' video on MTV and gone out and bought this album, labeling it the hottest out there. This is simply wrong. Nas will NEVER top Illmatic, and quite frankly this is only a little better than the horrible mess that was Nastradamus. Ether is just average, Nas had some nice lines about Jay-Z but the Rockafella line about dying from AIDS was just embarassing as it was far from the truth. Jay-Z checked Nas's career in ONE VERSE on 'Takeover' and I'm more of a Nas fan than Jay-Z! Rewind is hot, dope concept and Nas pulled it off very well, as did he for One Mic, which gets best song award from this album. What Goes Around and 2nd Childhood are probably the only other ones worth hearing from this lacklustre LP. If you are just getting into Nas then go and buy Illmatic now and realise how good this album COULD of been"
3,He should have called it NOTILLMATIC,"He's lyrics are right upthere, but when the album is produced by Swizz Bits you wouldnt expect for it to be the same quality as Illmatic."
3,Definately not what I was expectin',"With all the good reviews,I was in top expectations for this cd.But,when I listened,I realized it was no where to where I was expecting.If you want a good Nas cd,buy Gods Son or Illmatic,maybe even the Braveheart cd.1.Stillmatic Intro- 2/52.Ether-completley disses Jay-Z. 4/53.Got Yourself A Gun- 5/54.Smokin- 3/55.You're Da Man- 1/56.Rewind- 2/57.One Mic- 5/58.2nd Childhood- 2/59.Destroy & Rebuild- 2/510.The Flyest- 3/511.Rule- 4/512.My Country- 3/513.What Goes Around- 3/514.Every Ghetto- 4/5"
5,Love fo my babe Nas,Nas album is tight it worth tha money cuz he is tha best man. love 4 nas and hate fo al those haters who hate on my babe Nas. So all of you'll who think nas is not tight F**K you'll. Cuz you'll don't know anything. Just stop hatin. Alright love u nas cuz u r so fine and tight. Love 4 nas iam out holla a t a playa.
2,THIS ALBUM SUCKS,Aight...its clear that Nas' style has changed for the worst. His lyrics are wack compared to the lyrics on Illmatic. This album is a mediocre release for 3 reasons :1)His style and flow have become weaker over the years2) Ever since Nastradamus.. Nas has lost the ability to choose good beats. ( he needs to stick with Primo and Pete Rock)3)Calling the album stillmatic is totally disrespecting his first release Illmatic ..which is one of the best hip hop albums ever. This cannot compare to IllmaticNas should be ashamed to call this stillmatic
3,I dont know if he's STILLmatic...,"This is an average rap album. He starts off the album strong w/ some good songs then goes downhill. The songs towards the end of the album have good ryhmes, as always, but terrible beats and bad songs - it seems like they ran out of material and these are just ""filler"" songs. However, i don't regret buying this album because there are still a few quality songs and i have and always will like nas. Its not his best stuff but its still good."
4,Right on target,"I have a creative zen with its spakers, but after improving my sound with an IPOD (80g) I wanted to have something similar for the ipod. With Creative you will never make a mistake. Incredible sound for the price and the size."
1,Most of the codes in the book do not work,It is absolutely unforgivable for this book to be published given that most of the examples in the book do not work. The public should demand its money.
1,Bad Code for Connecting Access to SQL,"I bought this book to review VBA and learn how to connect Access to Microsoft SQL Server. The code for connecting Access to SQL is wrong, and there is no trouble shooting guide. I'm ready to throw this book away, and start over."
1,Don't waste your time & money,"This book is intensly boring! I had to read it for a class assignment (no choice) and I could barely stay awake! Parts of the book are OK, but the rest has too much violence for me."
3,Not the most Exciting Book,The Fighting Ground is about a boy named Jonathan who wants to join the Continental army during the Revolutionary War. His father had recently been wounded in the war and was sent home. One day Jonathan decided he would just join without his father's permission. His group was going on a march to meet some Hessians(German Soldiers paid to fight in the war) that was coming to his town. They meet the Hessians and Jonathan gets scared and runs away thinking that they lost the battle. He gets captured by 3 Hessians coming to look for him and gets into a mess of trouble with following with some misfortunate and fortunate events. Overall the book was okay but not as interesting as I would like.
3,The Escape,1. Brief Retelling:In this book Hohnson has to go and fight the hessian. The Hessian gets Johnan.2.Personal Reflection:My Opinion of the story is that it is good but the author could have made it better.3.Story Element:A Dyrimic charater johnan changes alot in the story. He goes from a farmer to a solider.4.Recommendation:This book is great but the author could of made it better.
3,the Fighting Ground Book Review,"Jonathan, in The Fighting Ground is an average 13 year old boy who badly wants to be a soldier, in the Revolutionary War. Jonathan is an extremely responsible boy. When he had to borrow a gun, and it fell and broke he contacted the owner to tell him. The owner was disappointed because it had been his great grandfathers, but he understood. Also when he found a run-away by he gave him food, shelter and just got him help. Even Jonathan is young by he is very well mannered. When the corporal would tell him to do something he would even if it would risk his life. Jonathan is very loved and loving. Jonathan loves his parents dearly. Also he saved a boy who had ran from his bad parents. As you can tell Jonathan is a kind citizen."
4,The Good Book,I gave this book four stars because it was a great book all of the time! There was rarely a dull moment during this book. Avi described the characters very vividly. He is a great author and writer which makes his books come to life.While I read this book I felt like it was all happening in front ofmy eyes that is what I enjoyed. I would definetly recommend this book to most ages!
2,"Slower, Slower, Slowest","I run McAfee software from a pre-installed package. Recently it upgraded itself to virus scan 10. Now whenever I try to do anything (something easy as try to bring up the ""send to"" menu) I see 100% CPU usage and a 2-3 minute wait for something to happen. The customer support seems to be a joke, or maybe another way to get your money.Incidentally be aware that if you subscribe to McAfee and your subscription runs out. It is not that the software stops updating. It will stop running. And if you do not have an active internet connection (one way of avoiding internet hassels for a moment) when it trys to check with the ""mother ship"" to see if your account is active, it will fail (obviously) and shut off. Then you have to notice and turn it back on.Norton that I use at work is never so much trouble."
1,ViruScam,"The software itself deserves probably 2 or 3 stars but it gets one star off for scam-like handling rebates. Once they make a mistake, there is no way you can communicate with them and correct it. They ask for new documentation, you mail or fax it - and nothing happens. Then you give up. Total waste of time."
1,You will not receive your rebate. I promise.,"I purchased this product from Best Buy and was told by the clerk, ""But you'll never get that rebate."" When I asked why not, he told me it was because McAfee commits rampant rebate fraud and that they ""lost"" (he used finger quotes) documents from rebate submissions. I poo-poo'ed his comments and bought the product anyway.After carefully packaging my rebate materials (I'm an attorney, and an anal-retentive one at that), I sent my rebate off -- only to be told that I didn't put the UPC or the proof of prior Symantec purchase in my package.That kid was right on. Pretty bad when you hear about the fraud from the retailer of the product.BEFORE YOU BUY THIS PRODUCT, I ENCOURAGE YOU TO USE THE GOOGLE SEARCH ENGINE FOR ""MCAFEE REBATE SCAM"" or ""MCAFEE REBATE FRAUD."" If only I had done this and/or listened to the store clerk at Best Buy..."
1,Beware of McAfee Rebate Scams,"McAfee doesn't honor rebates as advertised. You can follow instructions to the tee and they denied the rebate for ""missing"" documentation that you did enclosed. Make copys of all documentation and then it's a roll of the dice whether you recieve the rebate."
2,Not Good..,"I am going back to Norton...Biggest mistake I ever did..Plant some virus and try if this software can find it NO WAY...Sure this is fast, scanning entire computer in about 8 min compared with about 30-40 min with norton ..but this doesn't work..I think thats the whole goal of antivirus software..I am wondering why I am giving 2 stars..I guess.just that I am generous..."
2,Its ok.,Well installation process of this product is not ok in Windows XP machine. It reboots like 2 times before it could completly install the software which is not good. Norton Antivirus does not do so.It does not detect spyware on the fly. When it runs the scheduled scan or manual scan then it detects for spyware. Spyware scan should be active all the time like Virus Scan.I would say it could have been better.
3,RAS KASS SYNDROME (MAINSTREAMITIS),"I couldn't wait for this album to come out. All summer I was hyping the ""Lost In Space"" project up. Now that I got it... I feel like Dr. Dooom should kick Black Elvis's a$$. I'm not saying Kool Keith lost it because he's still one of my top 5 best MC's, but like the underated, lyrical-professional Ras Kass, the beatz simply don't work. For an album to be tight, the beatz and the rhymez should co-exist and flow naturally with each other instead of fighting each other. That's what happened to Scaramanga's solo album too. I'm still one of Kool Keith's top listeners, but I'm a real picky hip-hopper when it comes to the beatz. I'm not going to force myself to like it. 3 stars for lyrical content."
3,Still good but...,"We can't compare Paul Laine (the new vocalist) with Ted Poley. The band isn't the same. A great band is made by talent, friendship and lucky. The original Danger Danger was full of talent but they had no lucky (not as much as they should have). And than the friendship was broken... and the 5 perfect musicians are now just 2... and a new vocalist. Dawn is a very good Rock n' Roll album, but all the people that knew the original Danger Danger would say that it's just another Rock album... with nothing special."
3,Invicta Watch,Watch is stylish and very accurate. Found adjusting small dials a pain. In fact I never completed the setting of the small dials. Was not a smooth operation and took much too long .
1,Horrible experience,"Malfunction straight away. Random slowness, was not battery. Hardtoken return as a defective item. Disappointed at such high reviews but low quality."
2,second hand doesn't aligned with the second marker..,The looks and feel of the watch is really great but I think the reason why they sell this in a much lower price because its defective. The longer hand (which is the second) does not align with the marker. It is such a shame....
4,Great watch,Have received complements on looks. So far keeps great time. Only complaint was the band was to long. It cost me $10.00 to have two links taken out.
4,wanna be Rolex,this watch is a beautiful watch for a person who can't afford a Rolex but wants to style in pristine of a rolex.
3,Crown doesn't come out,The crown does not come out. I have yet to take it to a jeweler. I would suspect that the product would work out of the box not be an additional hassle.
4,nice watch smaller than expected,"amazon says size is 39 mm.(correct)invicta web site lists size at 44mm(was hoping that was going to be the size,i like big watches)no- amazons specs were right.nice looking watch"
3,Lenda Viva,"EU acredito ser este livro de grandes ensinamentos partindo de John Galbraith, lenda do penamento econmico"
1,Way off the mark!,"This book features six ""mcat-like"" exams that are anything but ""mcat-like"". This is especially true for the sciences, notably the physical science sections. Quite simply, the exams ask you to do way too much calculating (with numbers that are next to impossible to handle without a calculator) and the real tests aren't like that. You can't do all that math (which you won't have to on the real thing) and keep your pace up. Don't bother with it."
1,This book is not as good as it promises to be.,"Although this book does have six full exams as promised, they are not in proper mcat format and do not match the difficulty level of the real exam. It is an O.K. book if you want to reinforce the basics, but your performance on these exams would be a poor indicator on how you would do on the actual test."
5,Wow! How did they do it?!,"I was shocked at how small this MP3 player was when I openened the box. I feared that it was TOO small to do everything it is touted to do, but I was wrong. In addition, I feared that 2GB was not enough memory for my wife (as compared to my 30GB Zen). I was wrong again. The memory is sufficient for my wife to have all the songs she wants on it together with family photos to look at. Downloading songs was a snap using either the Zen software or using MediaMonkey (I used the latter since I was converting FLAC files to MP3). Even my wife was able to download her own songs without my help. The controls are easy to use and the ZEN feels very sturdy and robust. The battery life has been very good as well. I highly recommend buying a wall plug recharger rather than relying on the USB recharger which can take hours."
4,Great product!,"I like this mp3 player alot. It's easy to handle and is lightweight. The scroll is nice, but I do wish that it had a stop buttons and such like the Vision: M. It holds about 300 songs with a couple video clips and photos on it. And the color is cute too. If you travel alot, I recommend getting a wall ac adapter, if you are away from your computer. All in all, it's a very nice product and for the price, I recommend getting it! It's a great investment."
4,Great player for my daughter!,"Great player,good looks and features for the price. Certainly superior to a similar I-Pod that a relative of ours has for less money. It has worked flawlessly since we got it. Easy transfer of data(without being stuck going through I-Tunes)."
1,Wrong -no QC - no customer service,"This item came in box that didn't quite look like the correct data switch. It did have a sticker on the box that said ""RJ45 data switch"". It is not. It is a video selector switch.I went through the return sequence. I described my issue, the item doesn't have a part number on it. I click continue and I'm told ""this item requires special actions, contact customer service"". At this point I am expected to enter everything again. My previous entries are lost, I tried going back and they were no longer there. I tried finding some way to contact the seller, not possible. I gave up. I'm out my $13 plus next day shipping costs, but I must cut my losses before losing any more hours of my very valuable time. I used some of that time here to warn others."
1,didn't work for me,"thanks to great success stories I read on reviews here, i bought this hoping to share a single phone line between my computer and a standalone fax machine. I need the line plugged to the computer most of the time, but will need to plug/unplug this line to attach it to the fax for the rare occasions that I do fax. Unfortunately, this did not work at all. I followed instructions to a T, and regardless of whether the switch points to A or B, only the fax worked, not the computer. I experimented and plugged one end to a regular phone and the other to the fax, and the same thing happened. Only the fax worked. Defective unit maybe? I mean, this thing does look archaic. But regardless of appearance, I would have been thrilled if this actually worked. But sorry, no thrills....At this price, it was not worth my time to return nor ask questions. Moving on to my next project already...hmpft."
4,Chemex cover,I use it to keep the coffee hot. You must hold your finger on the top or remove it before pouring. It is not really necessary but it's a nice touch to keep the coffee hot for awhile.
2,Nice lamp. Bad bulb.,"I liked the lamp initially. I have a whole collection of cheap hallogen lamps and this one seems to be better made. However, the bulb burnt out on me after just 3 months, which is much less than what I usually experience. When I tried to change the bulb I realized the bulb is different than most hallogen bulbs. I have checked a number of stores, including home depot, and I have yet to find a replacement. Home Depot said they had never seen a bulb like that. I may have to replace the lamp just to get a new bulb. I don't recommend this product."
3,Cool idea,"I thought this was a unique and cool way for baby to explore the senses. It's squishy, and the toys inside slosh around. It is small in size, but definitely something different to try."
2,good for advanced tummy time,This item was mildly entertainling for my daughter when she was pushing up on her belly and before she could crawl around 4-8 months.
2,too small,"didn't read the dimensions correctly when ordering. Upon arrival, I realized that this couldn't be use for tummy time at all."
3,"Does its job, a little boring",Toy works just as it should but it's a little boring even for my delayed one. I'm hoping she'll start playing with it to help with getting from her tummy to her hands and knees but time will tell.
4,pretty good,My 4 month old infant really liked this water mat. I bought 2 water mats and this was the better one! It really encourages exploring and crawling.
4,So hard to fill the water & air!!,"Length:: 1:40 MinsAs others have stated, it was a pain in the butt to figure out how to open the valve but once I got the water filled and the air tube inflated, we were good to go. At 9 months, my baby preferred to stand as opposed to crawl so I thought this might encourage her to spend more time on all fours. It sat on our kitchen floor for about a month until she finally started playing with it recently. She was first amused by the floating objects but didn't like that she couldn't get to it. I think this might be fun in a sandbox, buried underneath some sand -- she could pretend that she's uncovering a treasure! Now at 10 months, she has started crawling and recently began playing with this. In this video, you can see that she really likes to try & lick the fish!!"
5,Berenstain Bears: The Messy Room,"Brother and Sister Bear haven't been keeping their room as neat as Momma Bear would like it to be, and she threatens to pack up all the toys that are scattered on the floor, until Papa bear comes up with a good idea of how to organize all their things and make the room a better to stay. I think this book teaches children the good of being oranized and clean. Kid between the ages of 3 and 6 would enjoy this story."
5,Great addition for any serious GO player,"I love this book. I checked it out from the library, then bought it. The book doesn't teach you much about the game of GO itself, but shows you examples of how to apply the fundamentals in Business and personal development. The selling point for me was when the author started talking about Aikido and Frank Doran. I am a member of Aikido NW in Portland, OR. Frank Doran is my teacher's teacher. He still teaches today near San Francisco, CA. If you ever want to see some great aikido, look for one of his seminars [all over America and the Globe]. If you enjoy the game of GO, I would definitely recommend this book to broaden your perspectives."
2,Not up to the Tosh.0 standard,"As a fan of Tosh.0, this was a huge disappointment. I didn't realize this was made in 2007 until after viewing - here, Tosh lacks his fluidity and self confidence and seems somewhat nervous and out of place on the stage. He has trouble linking the material and some of the more offensive jokes - usually handled with a trademark panache in his TV show - come across as deliberately provocative without being able to extract the humor.The second half of the performance is significantly stronger than the first but by then you're not expecting the show to recover. I can only presume that he's discovered and perfected his style on the TV show where I tend to find most of his material very funny but this stand-up performance is definitely one to skip."
3,It was okay...,"It had a couple funny parts, not nearly as funny as his show tosh.0 though. I still love Daniel Tosh =)"
1,::sigh::,"With the loss of Mitch Hedberg, and the over saturation of Dane Cook; and unfunny comedian like Daniel Tosh CAN be successful; which is Saddening.His material is a soild C; but his delivery is purely amature.He's very overblown and plain."
5,Funniest out there!,"MY FAVORITE!!! Daniel Tosh is hands down the funniest stand up comedian out there. He is extremely clever, sarcastic, and confident. Definitely one of those people who is meant to be on stage. His jokes are very original, and he doesn't depend on shock value to make people laugh. He shoves you through your sense of right and wrong and has you in hysterics when you would normally be horrified. My husband and I have watched it at least 15 times, and I still laugh so hard that I'm crying each time! Love it!P.S. Definitely not for the sensitive type!"
1,Disappointing,"Overall his humour is low-brow and unintelligent; he speaks in a slow, un-engaging way and the topics he chooses to discuss are not ones that people can relate to universally or that truly highlight the comedic nature of life. He just swears a lot and crosses a lot of lines. Very disappointing."
3,My 21month old liked it,My 21 mo old liked this alot. She likes any and everything that has to do with Barney. I on the other hand thought it was okay. I've seen many other Barney videos that were better. I would recommend one of Barney in concert videos over this.
5,Questions,"I remember this movie but I don't recall watching it. I remember going to the movie store and my dad would have to get the right barney movie for me because I was scared to death of the way barney looked on the video case, so that leads to one of my questions. Question 1: I don't understand why barney used to be dark purple and had a deeper voice, it even shows a lighter colored barney in the top left corner on the box, so this confused me.Question 2: What role did sandy duncan play on these barney movies? What did she do? Was she a mother of one of the kids?Please, if anyone knows answers to my questions, please respond to me. Thank You! (sorry if this wasn't really a review)"
5,i watched it with my neghbor it was god e,"hi i would just like to say that this one is good tina youneli said of course she would say that this is one of the greatest tapees in the entire univirse well when we grew up with naomi she was 10 or 12 a kid she said thst it looked diffrent and she just watched this video tonight and there wasnot a change i dont know if changes csn be like this or something else mr, w wich stands for wiliam is doing fine and cant wait to write hisf first revew on amazon , com naomi cant wait eather this is such a good one so get in the car drive over to any kids store toys r us target blockbuster any store will havw it christian"
3,Barney's Christmas Adventure,"I am 14 years old boy, I watch waitng for santa it was little kid. Everyone sleep in Michael's house through, helping santa, and bedtime reading about ""The Night Before Christmas""."
4,Dated classic,"For a long time, this was the most thorough description in English of math typesetting. Rather than giving long lists of rules, it is an engagingly written essay. However, its concerns are not those of today's typesetter. In every section, the authors stress the need to consider the economics of each choice. That no longer matters, since with computer typesetting, layout can be chosen purely on aesthetic grounds. Read it for historical interest, but for practical guidance get the _Chicago Manual of Style_ or _Mathematics into Type_."
2,Only OK,This is the only John Eliot Gardiner recording that I have ever not enjoyed. The tempos are just too fast (even for the choir which at times struggles to keep up); the singing is very detached and marcato; and the period instruments (which I normally like) lack blend and sonority. I much prefer the old Marriner and ASMF recording.
4,Most Used Blades...,"I've used the AX and the Wrecker blades more than any other. I've used them mostly for removing tree roots (doing a lot of yard work this year) so the 6"" & 12"" work best. Cutting through roots surrounded by dirt and stones does reduce the lifespan of any blade but these seems to stand up longer that other cheaper brands I have tried. There may be other blades that are as good but I have been very happy with these. Amazon's pricing is OK but I have seen these on sale at the big box stores for the same or less price."
2,For wood only,"These blades work only for wood and are not durable enough for demolition. Pick blades marked for wood with nails or metal cutting, which remain sharp five times longer"
1,"Piece of Trash, Hinges Always Break",I too have the problem of hinges repeatedly breaking. At least I bought the extended service plan!This thing is a piece of crap.
2,Boring,Maybe you have to be a true Texan to enjoy this book. I gave up a quarter of the way through.
1,Zzzzz,"Unacceptable! Hauntingly pointless and mesmirizingly boring; ""Institute Benjamenta"" is a study in self-indulgence."
1,Soporific,"Insufferable. Recommended only for those having difficulty sleeping and not willing to take a pill. Makes ""Last Year at Marienbad"" seem like ""60 Seconds.""Actually, ""Last Year at Marienbad"" was a great film.In no way is this representative of the Quays' work or talent."
5,QB's Most Infamous,"If you like NY thug rap this album is a must for you. This is my best Mobb Deep album since Hell On Earth. The beats are so good and the production is excellent. Prodigy and Havoc outdid themselves on this album. I hope they never stop rapping. After I finished writing this review I'm going out to buy Prodigy's solo h.n.i.c. I hope it comes close to this album, if not even better... Anyways, this album is tight, I recommend you buy it if you like their sort of rap. It won't dissappoint you"
2,they sold out on this one,"Mobb Deep have finally sold out! After four classic hardcore albums, they have traded in grimy beats and rhymes for songs featuring 112, lil mo, and Ron Isley. Not to mention that Prodigy turns in his weakest performances on the microphone. If you are a true Mobb Deep fan, I would not bother buying this album...just listen to the older ones"
4,Infamy,"Infamy is not my best Mobb Deep album, but it is still a good effort. One thing they shouldn't be doing is trying to satisfy the mainstream so much, but this is still a tight album. The single Burn is worth the purchase alone. The beats on this album were hot. Havoc got some help from EZ-Elpee, The Alchemist and Scott Storch, but his production still shines on almost every track. So I would have to say although this is not their most stellar album by any means, it is a definate purchase for any rap fan."
5,Possibly the best Mobb album ever,"Mobb Deep have put out a classic here. In my opinion it is better than anything they have done in the past. Havocs beats were fu!ckin tight! P's lyrics were hard. The best tracks on this album were Burn, Live Foul, Hey Luv, Pray 4 Me and Get Away. Apart from that, there were the usual helping of guests that made it that much more enjoyable. I love this album. It is definately one of the best of 2002 and quite possibly Mobb Deep's best album ever. That means you should go pick this up now aight? You should also check out these albums: Cormega: The True Meaning, Nas: Stillmatic, Nature: Wild Gremlinz, Noreaga: God's Favorite"
5,STILL THE INFAMOUS MOBB,"yes, mobb deep has changed their style a bit. but they have to change with the times. they still come with the real, and you get used to p's change in lyrical style, and hav's slight change in production. STILL, this is an EXCELLENT album, and mobb deep is still as hard and real as they come-no bling-blingin'. one of the best albums of 2001. STILL THE INFAMOUS MOBB!!!!!!"
4,"Good, but not their best","This is another good Mobb Deep album. It never quite reaches the level of The Infamous but it has some nice moments. The songs that standout are definitely Get Away, The Learning (Burn), Get At Me, Nothing Like Home, Crawlin, and So Long. My best song on the album is Live Foul, which is a mindblowing track produced by Scott Storch, probably one of my best Mobb cuts ever. The rest is not bad, just pretty average. But with this album they once again prove they are one of the best rap acts on the market today. However I am still waiting for them to reach the level of The Infamous again. They keep getting bigger and bigger with every album, I hope they never quit"
1,Big waste of money.,"I can't believe how terrible this dvd is and I can't understand why people would be giving it four stars. They could have just pointed a camera at the stage and left it at that and i would have been somewhat satisfied, but they did so much editing that it is just a total mess. I can't even say anything good about it... nothing. Half the time the music doesn't even line up with what is going on on stage. And Ben Watkins needs to get a little more energy going. Try going to a Moby concert and you will know what I am talking about. It is a shame because every one of Juno Reactor's albums is great and then they release this total garbage. There aren't even any real bonus material like videos or interviews. How hard is it to put this stuff together?"
3,good,"the alarm clock is working in good condition,but the radio isn't that clear(sound quality),i mean i've ordered sony 'coz i thought the radio would be fine.it's good for an alarm clock but it's not that comfortable for listening the radio"
2,Oooooook.,"At first,I liked ths doll.When I went on myscene.com,they made it look better.I knew that they made it taller than a reguler myscenedoll,but I didn't know HOW tall.When I finaly saw it in person...it was almost as tall as me!And I'm more than 4 feet tall!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Hmmmm..now that I see this picture of it,they make it look cuter than it really is!Trust me.If your planning to buy this,I've seen it in real life.As soon as you see it in stores,you'llregret you ever wanted it.You can count on me.I know.Trust me,please,trust me.It's still pretty fun tho."
1,this is gross!!!!!!!!!,this doll is soo ugly!!!!!!!!!!!! gross!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i can't see how anyone could buy this.
2,LED Started to go after 5 months,I had no complaints about this machine for the first four months (would have been 4 or 5 stars) but I will now have to return it - which is a massive hassle given its size. The LED readout has burned out on two of the vertical bars. It's actual two sequential bars in two columns for a total of 4 sections of the LED that are unreadable. You'd think that might be minor until you realize how often you look at the microwave to tell the time or see how much time remains with your cooking. It becomes untenable quickly.
5,Fletcher and Zenobia,Read this charming and delightful story about a doll and a cat and a moth who find themselves together in a tree to my oldest daughter when she was a little girl.It's illustrated by Edward Gorey. Found a good used copy at Amazon (its out of print) and bought for her 41st birthday. Vida es breve.
4,THE JERSEY DEVIL MADE ME DO IT,"Darren Lynn Bousman's moody film is a taut psychological thriller set in the infamous Pine Barrens, home of the legendary Jersey Devil.Stephen Moyer (True Blood) trades his fangs for a backpack as the father who takes his family to the Barrens to disperse his father's ashes at their favorite fishing hole.It's not long before Moyer's disposition radically changes and mysterious deaths occur in the Barrens.The question arises - is dad going bonkers or does the Jersey Devil really exist? Bousman cautiously leads his audience down a cryptic path and to his credit, provides a surprising resolution.Moyer gets to use his native English accent and does quite well in his demanding role. Mia Kirshner is effective as his devoted wife who watches her hubby crumble before her eyes. The actors playing the youngsters are above average as well.THE BARRENS is an unusual and original hybrid, acting as a psychological character study and a creepy horror tale. Its worth a rental at least."
3,Just OK.,"This one is just OK. It is full of holes. Cell phone service in the middle of nowhere? A burning fire during a downpour? British accents, Southern accents, New Jersey accents? All from the same actor? Don't bother if there is anything else to watch."
2,Predictable,"Horror movies don't work for me if the characters are unlikeable - and that's the greatest flaw in this movie. The father is grumpy, stubborn and self-centred, the mother/step-mother is unbelievably acquiescent to his paranoid demands and the surly teen-age daughter is ... well, a surly teen-ager. Only the timid little boy in the family struck me as sympathtic.So immediately I don't feel overly concerned about the fate of the leads. Add to that a clumsy script, cheap looking effects and a plot you've seen many times before, and there's not much to recommend this one.I wonder if some of the the positive reviews for this are coming from fans of the currently popular television show ""True Blood"" which features the talented Stephen Moyer. He's a likeable actor and certainly brings something to the role, but it's not enough to make this a success."
4,Other sources are cheaper...,"Wish I had slowed down for a second, I would have realized I could buy this mp3 album on emusic for half the price. Oops."
2,No bang for the buck,I got this table to allow me to use the portable as a stationary at home. I looked at all the reviews over and over. I found it on Grizzly just a few dollars cheaper. This is way overpriced in the 1st place. Then it is without the tools it is to have with it. Most of all there was not one pic of set of instructions as to how this this goes together.I bought it mainly for the name and the fact I found no other table out there. I found you can placed the band saw in a vise and hold and operate it that way and much cheaper. I will return itI also found that you could not use the saw in up right or vertical because the saw has to be mounted up side down so the table is not usable.
4,Down & out funny,"Yet another ""Thumb"" film. Bat Thumb was stop ""No Face"" from erasing people's faces. He is assisted by the meddlesome & whiny Blue Jay. The best scene is the commissioner & the police chief sitting around & doing nothing until Bat Thumb shows up...just like the old Batman TV show."
4,GoThumb,"Ok, Gothumb city and this movie are a bit weak. I think Steve could have done a bit more than he did with this spoof. It is still funny, but out of his first 4 Thumb movies... this is the 4th place flick of the bunch. It is still entertaining, but don't get your hopes too high up there."
5,2 GB Flash Drive,The flash drive arrived promptly. It performs perfectly. I use it to backup all my data. I would recomend it to anyone based on my experience!
3,Barbie: Secret Agent PC game,This game is really hard. The moving laser beams are hard to get passed. I liked to dress the Barbie in cute dresses. The puzzles are alright but not very fun. I am 6 years old.
2,LOVE IT.... WHEN IT WORKS!,"Sharp R-402JW 1-2/5-Cubic-Foot 1100-Watt Microwave, WhitePerfect popcorn, quick 'n even heating, great interior visibility through the window, nice wide turntable. I'm lovin' it.But this would be my 3rd trip to the repair shop in the eleven months since i purchased this wonder, were i to choose to keep it. (Almost tempted.) Something to do with door alignment & fuses, which i haven't figured out how to adjust/repair/replace myself, kills it dead. I'm careful with the door, it's not that. Don't know what it is."
2,Not what you pay for,"I ordered this for a relative of mine as a Christmas gift, thinking it was the version pictured. Why shouldn't it be? I mean, there's a picture of it, and if it's not really what it says it is, isn't that illegal??? Anyway, I read the other reviews for the item which were posted months earlier, hoping that Amazon had straightened the issue out and now offered the latest version pictured instead of the older edition which is only complete up until June 2006. I was wrong. The version that I received, 3 days before Christmas, is in fact the older edition. It is not the amazing gift that I had imagined, in fact, this Amazing Spiderman collection isn't really amazing at all. My recommendation is to buy elsewhere, where you know that what you get is what you paid for. Speaks very lowly of Amazon as a whole. What else will I buy that is not the same as what is pictured???"
5,"refreshing American Memories, ... for trying times","The first resident historian at the renovated landmark Astoria Studios (APC), and then at the associated new American Museum of the Moving Image (AMMI), noted film scholar Richard Koszarski brought to life here an engaging early chronicle of a New York chapter of pictorial highlights in celebrating the best in American media. Published nearly twenty years before this age of grim Taliban influences and videogame savageries, it may be time again for us to reflect on a new sequel of refreshing views and memories in these serial chapters of American media culture."
2,life without dick,I think that I fast forward through much of the movie. The best parts for me werethe unexpected skills that the character Sarah Jessica Parker displayed from time to time.
1,One of the worst movies ever made,"I am only bothering to write this to warn people away from this travesty of a film. It is horrible. HOR-RI-BLE! Written and directed by Bix Skahill, one of the Mystery Science Theater 3000, I wonder if he didn't write it so that people could make fun of it through the entire film. Sara Jessica Parker and Harry Connick Jr. (and the rest of the b-grade actors in the film) seem embarrassed to be in it, mouthing their lines as if they were freshmen English students forced to read before class). It wasn't even fun to make fun of. Save your money!"
4,Note: we're looking for an American IDOL,"so the winner should be good, not only vocals-wise (a criterion which Fantasia doesn't meet), or personality-wise (another criteron Fantasia doesn't meet). La Toya should win with Jasmine as runner-up."
3,My ears are bleeding...,listening to Fantasia squeak her way through her songs and listening to Diana yell everything week after week after week.These two girls need YEARS of voice lessons to refine their voices and polish the way they sing!
1,Why does one have to squeak?,"Any REAL singer should be able to SING the song properly. Shrieking through the number and replacing the lyrics with ""yeah, yeah, yeahs"" is a total b*stardization of the number!"
3,"Bad singer, bad theme","These are actually good singers with the exception of Squeaky Idol Fantasia BORE-ino. This theme is a bad idea, though; can't get any boring than this. A better option would have been to choose for each contestant the best genre that fits his/her voice. Another overlooked item in this CD is the fact the ensemble song doesn't sound like one. Only Squeaky Idol's squeaks could be heard."
2,It's ok. It's an AI CD whaddaya expect?,"The only ones talented worth listening to are the first tracks. And Jennifer Hudson does an amazing job with her soulful rendition of ""Neither One of Us"" I might add. Great job for the first five, you've done us proud."
3,Fanatsia makes a believer out of me!,"Yes, having ruined this CD with her annoying track and seeing how poorly her single is selling (not even close to Kelly's, Ruben's or Clay's first week sales), Fantasia has made me believe that she'll be a one-hit wonder.I'm not surprised. She doesn't have talent, she doesn't have charm, she doesn't have personality. She doesn't even have education! (Well, she CAN make babies out of wedlock! That might be a talent.)SHE JUST DOESN'T HAVE IT."
4,John Stevens is my American Idol!,"Jennifer Hudson & George Huff sound the best. Overall, the American Idol 3 top 12 singers sound pretty good.You can hear the entire ""AI3 Soul Classics"" CD on audio stream at this link:http://entimg.msn.com/i/asx/audio_streams/AmericanIdol3_soulclassics_MBR.asx"
1,Fantasia sucks!,Consistently annoyingly squeaky performance that's just plain irritating to the viewing public!
3,LaToya?,"I'm just curious to see what everyone else thinks..if you think LaToya should not have been voted off like I do, hit the yes button."
2,Only two people worth listening to,"La Toya who already performs like a professional and Jasmine who has an enchanting voice.Jennifer and Diana have low-quality voices and can't do anything better than scream, all the men have limited range and styles, while Fantasia screeches her way through her songs (cover your ears!) like -- as Simon says -- Donald Duck in helium! Camille actually has a sweet voice and performs well here but is weak in the competition.If this is the best that America has to offer, we're in trouble."
4,Take out Squeaky Idol and this would be perfect!,Everyone did well except for Squeaky Idol who should not have made it to the top 12 to begin with.
4,Good!,"The most surprising performer here is Camille Velasco, whose nerves didn't seem to get the best of her. Jasmine is another contestant with a naturally beautiful voice. The worst performances are from Jennifer Hudson (you don't have to be ""over-the-top"" all the time, girl!) and Fantasia Barrino (who doesn't really sing, but, as many, many, many people have pointed out, only squeaks)."
5,Excellent Singers,I think they all did well. American Idol 3 received alot of talented singers and performers.Fantasia is a great performerGeorge tries to do his best and it workedLatoya you are a singer indeedDiana keep up the good workJennifer you go girl
1,Horrible.,"Don't waste your $14. I bought this because I am a huge American Idol fan. I was disappointed. The previous 2 seasons CDs were much better. The arrangements are terrible, very cheaply done. As if they were taped in a Karaoke bar. They are much better on TV!Save your money. If you want to hear what Motown is supposed to sound like, buy Michael McDonald's Grammy nominated ""Motown,"" it is simply fantastic. That is what those songs are supposed to sound like."
4,Open Doors,"2004, This is the year of OPEN DOORS for Fantasia.This is your Season.Walk in ItTO GOD BE THE GLORY!!!!YOU ARE A TRUE WINNER.!!!"
2,Mediocre,I continue to say there is no baroque movie good enough to watch. The best operas start with Mozart. Like other Baroque operas this is boring beyond belief.
3,Were The Nashville Teens One Hit Wonders?,This set was given as a gift to fill a hole in my British Invasion collection. I was pleased to add Tobacco Road and Find My Way Back Home to that collection. Both were played on the radio in the sixties and one was a huge hit. I was not familiar with a lot of the other songs. I suppose you would need to be a rabid Teens fan to know them all. Many were likeable tunes and others were not. This set is definately for Nashville Teens diehards. Tobacco Road remains one of the highlights of the British Invasion. Hearing this collection explains why their USA chart life was short.
3,Road Atlas for Vacation Travelers and Others,This atlas is sold in groceries and other stores alongside Rand McNally and AAA. I especially like the Gousha atlas for vacation traveling. The Gousha atlas is good for visiting national parks and other landmarks. The atlas is large-size and legible and reasonably accurate for a 10-year-old book. Business and other travelers can use the atlas as well.
4,Pro Diver,"Unfortunately I purchased the Grand Diver first before this one. Wow what a difference in size. I decided to keep cause it looks great, and for the price for a automatic watch you can't beat it. It's 43 mm that use to be big but now it's small to me after wearing the 50 mm Grand Diver. This is a great everyday watch."
1,Invicta does not do quality inspection,"There is no doubt that this thing looks good. The problem is, if I can't set the time, It's worthless. Somehow this watch made it all the way to my house without anyone realizing that it was broken. I cannot belive that Invicta would let that type of defect slip through their quality inspection. Very dissapointing."
3,Silly goodnatured fun,"My kids love this show. Me? I can't sit through it. But I have taken a trip much like this, so I get the hilarity o the moment I DO catch when I pop my head in. Over all now, I think I've watched the movie from start to finish, albeit in pieces. FUn for the kids. Silly for me."
4,awesomely funny,this movie is funny from start to finish. a good family movie that will be remembered.
3,Decent Movie,"I watched this movie the other day. It made me laugh in a few spots, this is def. a decent movie for the entire family. It's good to see Jeff Daniels on screen again since Dumb and Dumber. Him and Robin Williams are very funny at times."
2,a humor that is growing tepid,We know that Robin Williams is capable of so much more.. and this is what bothers us the most about RV.. a film of recycled plot and chuckles.. It is nicely wrapped and presented to us as typical family film fare.. but it can't disguise its lack of originality.. I would like to suggest a much better disfunctional roadtrip family movie of recent times - 'little miss sunshine' .. rv is good for a couple of laughs but not much more..
1,terrible,this is how salvador dali would make a comedy. the last time robin williams was funny was.....never. the only way he can be funny on screen is if he chose to get a public waxing. i'd pay to watch that.
2,I've seen this one before. . . .,"I kept getting this "" I've seen this one before "" feeling as I sat through this movie. Then it hit me. This movie has been done before. . . as in National Lampoon's Vacation. The one big difference in the two movies is Robin Williams is a less funnier Chevy Chase.Every lame worse case senerio you can think of happens in this movie. Everything is very predictible and most of it falls pretty flat. There are a few laughs but they are few and far between. There are alot of sappy family moments too. Most of those moments don't payoff either.Robin is way over the top as he usually is. I think he should stick to his more dramatic roles. I'd recommend renting One Hour Photo to offset seeing this movie. I still think his best work was his first. You can't go wrong with The World According to Garp."
3,No Alarm Indicator Light,"Normally when you purchase a Sony appliance, you would expect a top quality item because hey, they're a big name and normally rather expensive. But with the more products I purchase from them, this alarm clock is just another disappointment.As a person who constantly wakes up in the middle of the night with the fear of oversleeping and check that the alarm is still on, this alarm clock is a disappointment. Listed as one of the clocks features, this ""easy-to-see alarm indicator"" is barely visable with the lights on and impossible to see with the lights out in the middle of the night because this indicator does not light up! So if you are looking for the perfect alarm clock, look elsewhere!"
4,Cool jazz,"Great music for those of us that like to listen to traditional jazz from time to time. The flavor is very ""Sunday afteroon."""
3,The Little Engine That Couldn't Quite . . . (Meet Expectations),"I attempted to order the edition pictured at the top of this page. When I clicked to add it to my cart, a different picture (different edition) popped up, with a text message indicating that I'd receive the one I had clicked on, even though the picture had changed. Skeptical as I was, I proceeded, since I had been unable to find the preferred edition anywhere else. What was delivered was not the chosen edition, but the one that had subsequently appeared. I have no issue with the product, but it was not what I was attempting to order. My granddaughter will probably never know, but her grandparents do. This is my first issue with Amazon and its affiliates after many successful and easy transactions."
2,Not the original,"I thought a board book version would be great for a young child, but this is not the same as the original. The illustrations are cutesy, the text is abridged -- a real disappointment."
1,The Little Engine That Couldn't!,"This book did not interest my daughter one bit. Even though this book is considered a great classic, it seems out of date in today's world. Maybe it should be pushed to tje back shelf to collect dust. At least it would accomplishing something."
3,Moonless Face Dance,"On ""Face Dances"" The Who were ""faced"" (sorry) with a big problem; not with Kenney Jones but with substandard material. ""You Better You Bet"", ""Don't Let Go The Coat"", ""The Quiet One"", and ""Another Tricky Day"" are good songs, but the rest are definitely below The Who's standards. The previous year, Pete Townshend released his classic solo album, ""Empty Glass""; if he would've saved just a couple of songs from that set and used it here it would have made this album a lot stronger.Of the bonus tracks offered here, the best song here is an early live version of ""How Can You Do It Alone"". Even though it's really just a loose jam with Townshend sounding like he's making up the lyrics on the spot I found it ten times more enjoyable than the studio version. A live version of ""The Quiet One"" is also included."
3,First Post-Moon Album,"Face Dances was the first album the band released with their new drummer, ex-Faces member Kenny Jones. Mr. Jones was an excellent choice as he is a first rate drummer. The problem with Face Dances doesn't have to due with Mr. Jones replacing Keith Moon, it's that the band was slowing down and the songs aren't as good as many of their other releases. The decline started on their previous album, Who Are You, where there were several disappointing numbers. About half of Face Dances is made of substandard songs including ""Cache Cache"", ""Did You Steal My Money"", ""How Can You Do It Alone"" and ""Daily Records"". That being said, there are some great songs as well. ""You Better You Bet"" is a great song as is ""Another Tricky Day"". ""Don't Let Go Of The Coat"" is a solid number as is ""You"". The band was no longer consistently great, but they still showed flashes of their greatness."
2,not quite a total loss,"Despite having been a huge Who and Townshend fan for more than twenty years, I have never been able to listen to my LP copy of this album all the way through in one sitting. I finally bought a copy on CD for completion sake and gave it a whole listen. While it is better than I remembered, it is still a pretty mediocre affair. I agree with the reviewer who said that the Scoop version of Don't Le go the Coat led to a new appreciation of this song. However, I prefer the Scoop version of that and You Better You Bet. Another Tricky Day is pretty good and Daily Records is an OK example of the kind of songwriting Pete was doing at this point (compare to Guitar and Pen on Who are You). I will be happy to never hear Cache Cache or How Can You Do It Alone again, however.Finally, a correction to the review by Glenn Wall: John Entwistle, not Pete, wrote Success Story from Who By Numbers. Still a great song."
3,So-so,"The last decent Who abulm, Kenny Jobes cannot replace Moon. ""You"" and ""The Quiet One"" (Live and Studio versions)are the highlights of fthe album. New tracks are nhothing to brag about. A so-so album."
5,one of the best,"Maybe it's not what it was before Keith Moon died, but I think that this must be one of the Who's best. It's not Moon's loss, it's Townshends new style that makes the album different from the others. There isn't a bad song on it, it;s just outstanding, and that is why it is worth 5, and maybe even 6 stars. A must have."
1,The worst Who album ever made,"Plain and simple to the point, this is by far the worst Who album ever made. Listened to it again recently and it still stinks, did not improve with age at all."
3,A decent Who album,"Face dances is a decent album from the Who which though is better than average album, but is still no comparison to the early albums by the Who and is recommend to rock fans."
3,A bit more like solo Townsend than The Who,"After Keith Moon's death there was some question of what The Who would be like with out him. FACE DANCES gives us a sound that seems closer to a Townsend solo project, if Daltrey was to sing lead. There is less energy here and more introspection. This is not necessarily a bad thing; it's just different. Kenny Jones does a good job and gets to show off a bit on ""The Quiet One"" and ""Daily Records,"" and there some good numbers here. One stand out is ""How Can You Do It Alone,"" another embarrassingly close look at man's flaws via Townsend; a song helped a great deal by Daltrey's great vocal on it. Not quite a classic, but very listenable."
4,?,"This book is extremely good along with its first part and third part. Dire does have secrets but only known to one other person, the mysterious Alicia. Together both are powerful."
3,just as simple as it gets,"a very easy book to remind you to be in the center of your life course, to all the ages and all the readers who are at the frist stage to their soul searching...."
5,Restless was shown on TV several weeks ago and so my interest in buying the book.,"I am halfway through Restless and as always, the book is so much better than a movie or TV show."
5,A Riveting Story,"A riveting story, exceedingly well written, intertwining the lives of two generations. I will certainly look at Boyd's other books."
3,GOOD START BUT FIZZLED OUT CONFUSED,"I was loving this book until about 2/3rds of the way through. It was fast moving, beautifully well written and full of intrigue. Then suddenly the bubble burst - the wind went out of the ballon. At the end I felt confused, dazed and downbeatThe story has been explained by my fellow reviewers adequately enough so take a peak at those reviews. But we have a situation where a mission goes pear shaped and our heroine flees for her life, with her boss revealed as a double agent (yawn).She then lives a third life perpetually running from the second.It all ends very suddenly and unconvincingly - dragging the daughter into an unsatisfactory state of affairs; an implausible story line and death. The traitor commits suicide having implanted himself firmly in the bowels of British establishment.I was expecting a lot more as the tale unfolded. But nothing came...It was a real disapointment and confusing too."
2,Wasn't my type of book,I should have down loaded the excert first. Then I would have known that this was not a book I would have been interested in.
2,Boring,"Not a very suspenseful book, had to force myself to finish it. The daughter's story had no purpose except as an avenue to tell her mother's story, so, needles to say, the characters in her life were irrelevant, annoying, pointless. The mother's story was somewhat predictable, not too surprising. I felt like I was constantly reading about changing buses or walking routes to avoid being followed or Eva and Romers love trysts. It would have been interesting to find out more about Romer, how he came into his normal, upperclass life after killing everyone else and the war was over. After all the killing he did, for him to kill himself in the end was too simple a way to end the book, a let down. The description/write-up of the book was much more exciting than the book itself."
4,"Starts slow, hits a gallop","For the first 50 or so pages, I wondered if I was going to be able to finish Restless. But, Boyd got my attention as the scenes spread around the world and the Oxford/Belgium/England/USA contrasts and action developed. The story of a young Russian/English woman recruited and trained to be a spy was well described. The constant time bounce was an intriguing format and I was caught up in the daughter's shock, wondering what anyone would do if they found out a parent was a spy and had mrudered someone years before. Boyd is an excellent writer and this one was thoroughly enjoyed.Ron LealosAuthor of Don't Mean Nuthin'"
4,Restless,"""Restless"" performs a neat trick in paralleling the past and the present stories then melting the two into one. One small complaint: the Reuben Jones, the destroyer sunk by the Germans in the book, was in fact the Reuben James in real life. I'm surprised at a writer as good as Boyd is would let a small fact like this not be double checked. Inexcusable."
4,EXCELLENT REMAKE OF THE ORIGINAL!,"For those of us who have played the original Myst and Riven, realMyst will be a nice refresher while waiting for Myst III: Exile. The puzzles are the same but the 3-D effects are awesome. There is a new ""age"" at the end of the game that is more of a tease than anything else, but still fun! KEEP IN MIND THAT THE BOX CLEARLY STATES THAT YOU MUST HAVE AN NVIDIA GRAPHICS CARD!!! If you don't, you will certainly have some problems. I was fortunate and already had one and the game ran flawlessly. Looking forward to Myst III in April 2001!"
4,High system requirements but great fun,"The puzzles took a lot of thinking (and I resorted to an online hint guide often) but they weren't impossible to solve, and gave me a great sense of accomplishment once I had solved them. System requirements are pretty high. Though it says it works on 64 MB, after going through two ages, I came back to the library and the game was pretty much stuck (I would move about a foot per 15 min). Once I upgraded to 128 MB, it worked fine for the most part. Graphics are beautiful. However, if possible try to get a video card that supports FSAA (whatever that stands for :P) if you don't yet have one because if it doesn't, anti-aliasing won't work and graphics will be a bit jagged at the edges. I have that problem, and I can't easily get a video card so I'm stuck seeing the jagged edges. :("
2,Nice idea but a little impractical.,"This cover is well made and launders well, but with a baby who tends to relieve himself while being changed, I was constantly washing them. Changing pads are made with a wipe-clean surface, which is a lot easier than washing the covers."
5,I think I'm back in Rio de Janeiro!,"My husband and I are counting the days until we can return to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. This CD strengthens our love for the sounds, but makes us pine for Rio even more. A fabulous collection of samba and bossa nova, you will play this CD hundreds of times and never tire of it. There are also wonderful descriptions of each song's meaning and artists. Get this one...close your eyes...and you'll be back drinking a caipirinha."
1,oven incorrectly assembled,"The oven arrived with package in tatters. The oven itself seems undamaged, but the door will not close, apparently because it was assembled incorrectly. I returned it for a refund."
3,A Little Dry,"The subject matter sounded wonderful, and I was hooked for awhile. However, I was a bit disappointed that most of the book was dedicated to the bureaucratic dealings of the various services,the countries they were supporting, and the various armies they were attached to. I had been hoping for more information about actual patient care and how the ambulance services impacted that. There was a huge amount of detail on the vehicles used as ambulances. The discussion about the public view of the ambulance service as well as joining the war was good."
2,Valuable as an historical artifact,"Kovacs can be recognized as a bold, new innovator, and extraordinary talent as a character comic - although the only scant laughs in a typical show are found in his adlibs, ""in character"", i.e. Percy Dovetonsils, et. al.In this two-episode set, we have more of the avant-garde thing, accent on videotape tricks, and not on clever, pointed dialogue. Some intriquing camera angles, image manipulation; close-ups of the cast, who, by the way, are superb at mime. It's a shame that their work confuses the viewer more than entertains him/her.Best bit: Kovacs trouper as ""Mother Rustic"", who lives off the land...and relaxes by dabbling in conceptual painting, too far out for The Guggenheim!Main selling-point for this package: Kovac's last show from c. January, 1962. Plus interesting foreshadowings of the popular show Laugh-In.[some racial content, typical of the period]."
1,Annoying problems with these phones,"Bought this two-phone package about 18 months ago and they have not worked properly for over a year. The displays on both handsets died slow, painful deaths, one pixel at a time, over the space of several weeks. This renders the caller ID feature useless and you can't see what number your calling as you hit the keypad. The people at the other end of the phone repeatedly complain of random beeps coming from my end - highly annoying! These phones are cheap for a reason."
5,Great Bargain,"I'm a grandmother and bought this to have available when my grandkids come to visit. The price was a big factor in the selection, but it turned out that my grandkids have liked it better than the comparable Baby Einstein product I bought for their house that cost a lot more. This exersaucer bounces up and down as the child bounces. My youngest grandson has been especially entertained by that feature."
5,excellent entertainment,Excellent - pricing - quick delivery. Purchased as a gift. The child and parents love it.
5,I love this toy!,"This is the second exesaucer we have purchased, my youngest son is 4 months old and it occupies his attention for quite a long time. My first son loved his also, so we knew that this was a purchase worth making again."
4,Nice Product,This is a very nice product. It was a little difficult to put together thats why i gave it 4 stars. It does everything I expected it to do.
3,Pretty good album.,"This second solo album from Ace Frehley is pretty good. I find all of the tracks to be listenable. The album's musical direction is straight-ahead hard rock. There is a total of ten tracks--one of them is an instrumental (""Fractured Too""). The album's musicianship, songwriting, and production are good and satisfying. Ace Frehley sings on six songs, while Tod Howarth sings on three. Both do a good job with the vocal duties. The guitar work throughout is solid--there are some nice guitar riffs and solos. The tracks that I like the most are ""Into the Night,"" ""Calling to You,"" and ""Fractured Too."" ""Calling to You"" is a melodic and energetic tune that features really nice singing from Tod Howarth. The well-done instrumental ""Fractured Too"" contains some very good guitar playing from Ace Frehley, also. This is quite an enjoyable album that I like to listen to from time to time. Worth a listen."
2,Great Ideas... Too Complex,"As much as I liked the pictures and the possibilities of the gardens, there's no chance that the average person could even attempt some of the Japanese style gardens. The designs are beautiful but you really do need a LOT of room to do any of these designs. The idea of a calming, tranquil space to sit would be wonderful but not on my budget."
1,Broke Rod,The rod broke the first time I used it. Says it handles a 15 lb. capacity and unfortunatley that wasn't true. Just started the return process and hope that the replacement works better than the first one.
5,This book is a classic non-SF book,"This is not a new book but it is a good one, very different to Anne McCaffreys current style as it is a fiction novel not Science Fiction. An enjoyable light read."
2,It's Okay,"I'm not sure I can agree that this toy stinks, but it was hard to set and sometimes my friend's sister can get it. I don't have a password on it now, but if this keeps up I will."
1,Save Your Money,"My 11 year old daughter bought this from her Christmas money. She couldn't WAIT for it to arrive. She was so disappointed. Despite repeated attempts, both by her and her oh so wise and talented folks, we could not get this thing to operate like it was supposed to. It kept resetting itself, not letting us get through the entire initiation process. Bottom line, save your money, find a good hidey-place for that same journal with a tiny little lock and key that we all had when we were little girls."
1,I hate this toy,"It is VERY VERY VERY VERY hard to get open. It doesn't even recognize YOUR voice!!! My sister couldn't get it open for so long. It's a hassle to set the alarm, you have to refer to the manual too much and you also have to enter one number at a time. Oh my godness, this toy left me baffled. I feel like returning it. I wasted my money."
1,"Crappy, disfunctional toy","i wish i could give this 0 stars. when i bought this, i tried to record the password and it said ""incorrect password. please repeat again"" it took me AT LEAST 50 tries to get it to set it. thats when the real problems started. the light wouldnt turn on, the pages were teeny tiny, there were only 10 pages in there, everytime i tried to set the date it would say December 99, the voice got crackly and i couldnt understand a word it was understanding. do not buy this toy, it is a waste of money!!!"
1,Please don't waste your money!!!,"I was dumb enough not to believe this could be so bad. My 9 year old and her 9 year old cousin both received this journal for Christmas. They were both in tears by nightime. One on the East coast, one on the West coast. Neither one worked properly. My husband actually opened the journal with his voice. No privacy and two frustrated, sad little girls. I will be returning this one when the crowds go away!!!"
1,Do not waste your money,I bought this toy for my 9 year old daughter and she was only able to open up the diary twice since she had it. The diary keeps saying acess denied. My daughter was very disappointed and upset that it did not work; especially for the cost of the present.
1,HATED IT!,This was one of the worst gifts ever given. My 8 year old daughters (triplets) really wanted this. They ended up crying most of Christmas morning because it didn't work. It didn't regonize the password and would open randomly. I DO NOT recommend this. I did call the company but they were ABSOLUTELY NO HELP AT ALL! They didn't care that we spent [...] on junk and that our girls were heartbroken on Christmas morning. I guess it's true what they say about these big toy companies....bottom line...they want our $$$$. I also DO NOT RECOMMEND the Icee Maker. Another big piece of junk!
2,Password Journal 4 Doesn't work,"Bad experience with this toy. The first one got a jammed button, and directions were not really clear, so I just sent the thing back. I got a new one. The new one didn't jam, but it doesn't record/maintain a password. So, basically my daughter got a 19.99 cool journal with a push button open. She sort of likes it but the point is, it doesn't do what it's supposed to do. I recommend against it."
1,Do NOT BUY THIS!!!!,I consider myself pretty technologicaly savvy and still could not get this thing to work. I could not get ANY function on this to work properly. I should have listened to the other reviews. Waste of money. My daughter and I gave up on it only 3 days after Christmas and now it's just thrown in the back of her closet.
1,A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!,"My daughter begged for this toy for her 8th birthday, and is completely frustrated and let down. We have not been able to get it to open without resetting it because it will not recognize her simple one word password. We haven't been able to set the time, date, or alarm because it doesn't seem to be able to focus. It's been educational, in the way that it teaches her not to believe the stuff she sees in a commercial. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!"
5,mrs. Gray,"i think this is a great toy for kids of all ages, because you are the only person who can get into it. so i would say if you have a person who goes through your stuff this is perfect."
3,Radica Girl Tech Voice Recognition Password Journal,"This was purchased for my daughter,she was a little frustrated trying to program it, and my husband and I were too, she has had this item for about 2 years, and she does like it and still use's it,but not the voice recognition command, she uses it manually."
2,This stinks,This toy will respond to any voice. My brother got into it and he didn't even sound like me!!!! Don't buy it(it will end up in the trash!!) It is too expensive for how stinky it is.
3,"Informative, but a dry read","Parts of this book have been interesting, but I find it very dry reading through it. I bought it for a music class I'm taking in college, and I think it's neat how it has hymns in the back of the book to compare to what you're reading (history-wise and analysis-wise), but it's hard to stay focused on it sometimes."
5,selffeed bit,We ordered this to help drill holes in the side of walls so we could insulate the house. It worked great.
3,OK for soft wood otherwise it jams,"At times I still grab one of these self-feed hole cutters when I need to make a large hole through a thick timber, to big a hole for a auger bit and too deep for a TCT hole cutter. Nails will kill the edge which is tool steel and the screw that makes for the self-feed action is OK for soft woods but on any hard wood like I run into with old houses and the screw pulls the hole cutter in faster than the blades can cut and the hole cutter will jam and wrench the drill. Recommend using the least powerful drill you can get away with so when it does jam you are less likely to get hurt. MDF and OSB will dull the blades quickly but you can use a fine Arkansas hone to dress them and keep and edge on them. Speed wise they are midway between a bi-metal hole saw and a TCT hole cutter."
4,Armin pumps out another master-blaster!!!! BUY IT!!!!,"Another tasteful delight cooked and served up by the great Chef of Trance music!! Virtually flawless & seamless mixing. Very passionate and deep. Stirs the emotions within oneself. Great for partying or easy listening. As always, Armin reveals another part of his spirit in his music!! Go buy the CD, you'll be glad!!"
2,SONY ERICCSON P990I CASE,"THE CASE IS BUILT OUT OF A FINE LEATHER.HOWEVER, THE BELT CLIP IS VERY UNSECURED AND TENDS TO FALL OFF YOUR WAIST VERY OFTEN.THEY SHOULD IMPROVE IT BY CHANGING THE OPEN BELT CLIP BY A CLOSED ONE."
2,Disappointed,"This book seems to suffer from the same problem as the rest of Niven's more recent work--a lot of things happen in sequence and are more or less connected, but Niven forgot to make a *story* out of them. I found it disjointed and pointless."
2,Not up to par,"I reread the first two before I read this, I'm sure that helped some. But I was still quite disappointed with this. It was not up to the standards of the first two. I would also say that this is one of Niven's worst books. The first half of the book and the second half are only slightly related. I got tired of hearing about rishing all of the time and there were enough 8 syllable names of extra characters that I just didn't bother trying to keep track. If your a serious Niven fan then you may want to read it for curiousity. Otherwise, skip it."
3,What a sad way to end the saga,"I rate this book a five only because I enjoyed the first two in the series so much. Throne was utterly disappointing and not at all to the standards of the rest of the series.There were some very interesting ideas presented here, but the story was forced and uninspiring and the attempt at looking at different cultures half-hearted and lacking depth"
1,Stop Reading Before its Too Late,"The 'professional' reviews for this book are much too kind.Compared to Ringworld and Ringworld Engineers, Throne is a major disappointment through and through. I just kept slogging along through the unreadable narrative, uninteresting characters with unpronounceable names whizzing by my head, looking forward to every sensible moment with Louis and the Hindmost. I only finished reading it because the Protectors storyline finally started to get my interest in the end.I should have stopped reading at page 100."
1,A disappointing book,The plot in this book seems rambling and disjointed. Various people go off on adventures for whatever reason and then fade away. I cannot imagine the publisher would have published this book if the author would have been new and unknown. Larry Niven needs to leave Ringworld and find a new setting to write about.
4,"Not bad, but not up to the first two","If you've read the first two Ringworld books,You'll probably enjoy this one, it's gotmore details about Ringworld, and (this is new) a large section written from the perspective of Ringworld natives. It's quite interesting, especially if you are (like me) a Ringworld nut. On the other hand, I dont think it quite lives up to the first 2 books (which I'd rate 10), despite being quite a bit longer. And the ending was just a tad hard to follow I dont know if Niven quite has the touch he used to. I dunno. If you've read the first 2 books, read this! (Make sure you've read them, though, otherwise this book would be incomprehensible)"
2,Who are these people?,"This is most definitely not a stand-alone read. I had read Ringworld, but not Ringworld Engineers, and spent over half the book trying to figure out who these characters were and why I should care. I finished it through sheer deternination long after I had quit caring what happened. Maybe, if I had read Engineers, I wouldn't have had a problem, but then, maybe I would."
1,Eagerly Awaited...Hugely Disappointing,"I have never written a review before, but I am compelled to in this case. Larry Niven has always been one of my favorite authors, mainly due to his Known Space series of books and short stories. However, this book was a major disappointment...it was as if someone else wrote it. The book was a bore...poorly developed characters, sub-plots dying out, and the main plot just plodding on and on. If I didn't like the book, I just wonder what those who don't know anything about the Known Space history would make of it. Basically, Niven gave me no reason to have any interest in the characters or the plot. I hope he does better next time."
1,Avoid this book...,"I have enjoyed a number of Niven's books, but this one was essentially a waste of time that went nowhere. Particularly in the second half, at times the writing was so sketchy that i was not sure what he was trying to say!Unless you are reading it to fill out your list of Niven's books, i suggest reading something else!"
4,do some research before you read!,"I was disappointed to read the other reviews of this book, which concentrated on what I considered strengths of The Ringworld Throne. I find interminal reviews of basic concepts like scrith, tree-of-life, etc. a waste of text and money. I look forward to the next Known Space novel, which will hopefully feature some final confrontation between Louis Wu and the Ringworld inhabitants, the Pak and their Protectors, and the Legacy of Brennan and the Home Protectors.Geoff Frizzell"
1,Who wrote this book?,"Not only was the story bad (see most other reviews here), but the prose was so poorly written that it makes some children's books look like fine art. 95% of the sentences are 10 words are less and are structured as ""so and so did something"" or ""something happened"". If my 10-year old were to write a book, it would be a better read than Ringworld Throne."
2,What happened in this book?,"This book taught me a valuable lesson; trust the general consensus of the other Reviewers. I purchased this book despite the fact that there were soooo many negative reviews. I figured I liked the 1st 2 books so much, that I would give this one a try. The first 1/2 of the book is interesting, but doesn't really pertain to the overall story. The second half of the book stunk, and made me wonder if there really was any point to the book. I hope someone can someday pick-up the Ringworld concept, and run with it. There are so many interesting story lines to follow, but this book did not do that. Oh well, onto the next book."
4,"Great, But OVERPRICED","This product has worked phenomenally well for us. Baby girl is content instead of staring at the blank seat and when I glance back I can see her perfectly. It's cute, big, and sturdy.However, I was lucky to find this product at a thrift store in excellent condition for only $1.50!!! I refused to pay over $25 for it online. If you really want it and cost isn't an issue, it has been a fabulous product and I would recommend buying it.The only other downfall besides the cost is that you have to surface clean it only. If you could remove the mirror and toss it in the washer that would be great. But I assume they think there isn't much chance of it getting dirty. But if you have kids & pets... everything has has the possibility of not remaining clean.I gave it 4 stars was because of the price. The actual product deserves 5 stars."
4,Very good.,"Got it for my mom, she loves it. But there is a basic law written in the stars that a mother HAS to ""love"" everything her son or daughter buys or makes them, so it could just as easily have been a playdough ashtray to be realistic. The only problem she's mentioned is that the brakes were adjusted incorrectly. We'll see how easily she fixes this."
3,Received later than expected.,"Received today - 12/2 - when expected by 11/24. Car was out of commission all that time. But once received, installed immediately and now the car looks old compared to the new headlamps."
1,Very disappointing,"I ordered this book from a quilt shop and am planning on sending it back. While it claims to be 400 quilt blocks, there are many repeated blocks with simple color changes. If you eliminated the duplicate and triplicate blocks it would probably be less than 200, then there are some really ugly blocks - they almost look like mistakes. Well, I didn't like it, anyway."
1,A poor hybrid of the author's life & a biog. of Daisy Bates,"Too much novelistic improvisation and repetition ruin this book. Julia Blackburn is clearly more interested in Julia Blackburn than in Daisy Bates. Julia Blackburn's ideas and dreams are constantly inserted just when you think you might get to read something about Daisy Bates! Julia Blackburn presents Julia Blackburn as a dreamy, visionary person, while describing Daisy Bates as a Liar over and over and over again, and then giving Daisy an ""imaginary"" life... It could have worked if Julia Blackburn weren't so in love with herself--- I bought this book because life among the Aborigines sounded interesting. But it's really too much about Julia Blackburn and she bores me. I read a lot of novels, biogs, poetry, and history, and this books tries to capture it all and while at times it is eloquent, it often feels false and flat."
2,Parks and MacDonald,"I've heard that Walter Parks and Laurie McDonald (the producers) have now distanced themselves from these movies, It is easy to see why with no laughs and b-movie Rick Baker effects, these films are not real movies, they are a joke."
5,Pilgrim's Progress in Today's English,A book used in US classrooms for the first 100 years revised in todays English for easier understanding I found it best used in a group setting!
5,"Complete story in very readable, yet ""classic literature"" format","I finally picked up my original copy of ""Pilgrim's Progress"" to read, and even though I could wade through it, it seemed senseless to try to understand the ""Old English"" when an updated version was available. Plus, I want my teen age son to read this for school, and the original version would be too archaic for him.This version very effectively captures the ideas that John Bunyan wanted to convey, and inspires me in my journey."
2,Not Happy,I can't review something I never received. I contacted the seller and they said they would send another shipment and have not received that one either. I will not be ordering anything else from this seller.
5,"coffee candy, but there's one better. . . . .","I thought I was buying the Bali's coffee candy that has the espresso in the middle. This is the coffee candy without the espresso in the middle. Each candy is about half the thickness of the Bali's with the espresso. This candy is good, but the Bali's with the espresso inside each candy is better."
4,Delicious coffee flavored candy.,Really like this candy. I don't generally eat any candy but I am a sucker for coffee flavored things. These really are quite delicious.
4,Good shampoo,"Completely stopped the itching on my head (i don't know what causes my itching) for almost 3 months, but then i started to itch again :( But still, worth trying if you have itchy or dry scalp. It has no strong smell and leaves hair soft and manageable."
5,awesome shampoo,"I'm a grandma with aging hair and was looking for a gentle shampoo that would cleanse well but not turn my hair dry. This shampoo fit the bill perfectly . It is a thick liquid that you massage in and let set on your hair for a couple of minutes. Within a week of using it, I noticed a difference. My hair was clean no matter how much product I had put on it, but it was looking smoother with less frizz. So I'm looking forward to seeing how my hair improves with continued use and I' thinking I'll try the matching conditioner too."
3,Works but drying,"I had high hopes for this shampoo because I use a TheraNeem product on my face which is the best non steroid treatment I've ever found for eczema. This shampoo does take care of most of the scalp itch, but it's terribly drying and I find that I'm unable to use it without augmenting it. If I add several drops of jojoba oil to it I can prevent most of the drying but I still don't feel comfortable using this more than once a week.YMMV. Maybe somebody with really oily hair would appreciate this, or a guy with very little hair, but I'm used to my hair coming out soft and bouncy even if I shampoo daily, and this stuff makes it feel like straw."
5,Scientific Fun,"Mythbusters is a great show for everyone! The hosts, along with their team, crack myths and urban legends using science. This DVD Set is a great value for the money. 4 Discs for $20. I also found it was much cheaper than the Boxed versions sold on the discovery channel site which retailed for $50 each. The show is funny and you will learn from it whether you realize at the time or not. Great for kids, teenagers and adults. I feel like it is a parallel to the fun science shows of my youth like ""Bill Nye the Science Guy""."
2,Not reliable pens,"Out of a pack of five, four were working. I basically used the pack to add to a previous order to make free shipping. If I had really needed these, I'd be disappointed."
5,Johann David Heinichen: Dresden Concerti,"Johann David Heinichen: Dresden Concertin is a 1993 Deutsche Grammophon GmbH recording under the direction of Reinhard Goebel who leads the Musica Antiqua Köln (on authentic instruments). Reinhard Goebel has written a very well-written essay entitled ""Johann David Heinichen: Twelve Concerti Grossi"". Being a huge fan of Baroque music I loved every single second. Highly recommended indeed. 5/5."
3,Pop a la (Depeche) Mode.,"Like their German counterpart Camoflauge, Cause and Effect make no attempt to conceal their love for Depeche Mode on its album ""Another Minute."" That simultaneously works for and against them. The singles recall the synth pop of the Mode, but without the moody atmospherics. The discocentric ""You Think You Know Her,"" the title track, and ""What Do You See"" recall DM so well, it's near-scary. Even the vocals recall David Gahan's signature moan. But while imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery, it doesn't say much in the way of originality. Still, it's hard to completely snub a record as overall agreeable as ""Another Minute."""
2,One-Hit Blunder,"""You Think You Know Her"" was a fantastic synthpop single and a brief club hit in the early 1990's. It was the highlight of the album, though, and the rest is forgettable. I recommend downloading the single and skipping the rest.The Depeche Mode comparisons are somewhat apt, but C&E; lacks the originality and progressive edge off that band. A pale comparison, at best."
2,"the cause and effect, depeche mode soundalike,misses que...","Although the music is ok,,, the songs lack a general appeal like those found on trip (a far superior and spiritual album) the success of this group borders on the demographic that enjoys a depeche mode spinoff. sorry to say I did not find this album as enjoyable. But will add it to my library of music nonetheless."
4,The roots of greatness,"Just a short review...Led Zeppelin - BBC Sessions (1997) is a fine collection of live recordings from the early days of Zeppelin's career. Zeppelin's roots are mainly hard rock and blues, and this album reflects that. Several songs appear multiple times - ""You Shook Me"" (twice), ""I Can't Quit You Baby"" (twice), ""Communication Breakdown"" (three times), ""Dazed And Confused"" (twice), and ""Whole Lotta Love"" (twice). The songs have a very raw sound to them, which I like. There a quite a few blues covers. If you don't have this set but you have all of Zeppelin's other material and are looking for something ""new"" and ""fresh"", I recommend this set. This two-CD set will satisfy your need for some raw, live Zeppelin.I rate this set 4 stars due to the repeats of some songs, but overall it's a great collection. I highly recommend it."
2,Led Zeppelin ARE the most overrated band of all time.,Ignore everyone who says that Led Zeppelin are the best band of all time.They're not. They really are the most overrated band of all time.
1,THIS BAND IS SO OVERRATED IT DEFIES BELIEF,"Y'know ,if people released an album that contained the sound of a hundred pigs being slowly tortured to death and then put a sticker on it that said ""Official Led Zeppelin album"", people would buy it by the millions and say to each other "" Wow, it's great isn't it?"" Wake up people.If any parents are thinking of buying an album of Led Zeppelin for your son or daughter's birthday/Christmas present I should tell you that this band, along with U2, are deeply overrated.The world has simply been brainwashed into thinking these bands are good. I do like hard rock , which is the music Led Zeppelin are usually classed as, so I like to think I know what I'm talking about. Rush , Queen , Aerosmith and 70's Black Sabbath are so much more talented than these two bands."
1,"GET IT THROUGH YOUR HEAD,LED ZEPPELIN IS TERRIBLE LIVE","I DON'T EVEN HAVE THIS ITEM,BUT I STILL DON'T LIKE IT.IF YOU ASK,IT'S BECAUSE LED ZEPPELIN IS BAD LIVE.YOU CAN'T EVEN HEAR ROBBERT PLANT'S VOICE VERY WELL AND THE SOUND QUALLITY ISN'T VERY GOOD.THE ONLY TIME THEY SOUNDED GOOD LIVE WAS HOW THE WEST WAS WON.THAT RIGHT THERE IS A PIECE OF MASTERPEICE.I HIGHLY THINK THIS BBC SESSIONS CRAP IS WASTING MONEY."
5,"Led Zeppelin, the blues band...","BBC Sessions shows the white-blues side of Led Zeppelin, a side of them that only showed itself on occasion. In these live sessions, they perform awesome versions of their blues tunes, (You Shook Me, Since I've Been Loving You, I Can't Quit You Baby) and some other classics that only appear on this collection (Travelling Riverside Blues, Somethin' Else, Boogie Chillun). But Zeppelin never ceases to let their more dominant hard rock side come out and play (Heartbreaker, Whole Lotta Love, Communication Breakdown, Dazed and Confused). There's something here for everyone, the blues fans and the hard rock fans. My favorite part of BBC Sessions is the little acoustic bit where Zep does a wonderful Going To California then goes straight into the beautiful That's The Way. All fans of Led Zeppelin should own this."
4,Raw and Powerful,"I have long been an advocate of ""Song Remains The Same"", Zeppelin's other live album. It's polished to the point of calculated versions of stadium filling Zeppelin was, and still is one of my favorite albums of all time.So upon first listening to this immense collection of almost bootleg quality live early recordings, I was kinda put off. But after a few times listening, I began to weed out all the filler that this 150+ minute set contains. And what was left was actually quite powerful.In contrast to the ""tired but proud"" performances on ""Song Remains"", BBC boasts several firewalled and shakey performances of pre-superstardom Zeppelin.You keep waiting for all the wheels to come falling off, but they never do. This is pure energy. They are months away from all the money and fame, and what you hear is the hunger.So while, ""Song Remains the Same"" will always have the nostalgia value to me, I have to recommend this one over it. It's the ""real"" Zeppelin."
4,Flawless Music,"Led Zeppelin BBC Sessions cd plays flawlessly. I will not hesitate to order additional items from this seller. Though the jewel case was ""average"", the overall product was what I wanted."
4,A Chip off the old block,You've got to be a Turrentine 'nut' like me to get into this. Some good stuff on it but not the best he's ever made.
5,Hillarious prank calls!,"Man, this is a hillarious video full of hillarious prank calls. All five of the Jerkey boys succeeded in this movie. The Jerkey Boys creators went on to announce on a tour bus also and were announce in a groecery store with the voices that made me take a big wizz in my pants. Now, I want this video for special occasions."
5,DOES THE JOB,"I purchased these batteries for my flameless candles. They work real well for my purposes and I can now leave the candles on all the time and simply recharge the batteries about every two weeks or so. I don't think they would work as well for candles on a timer which last several months on two batteries and only use 5 hours a day of battery power since no rechargeable battery holds a charge like the alkaline ones do. Having said that, these do exactly what I purchased them to do and I am very pleased with them."
4,Good bible study material,"I really like the bible study material in general, I only was not aware you kind of need the dvd with it for the introductions of the different sections if bible studies. It would have been helpful if I had known this from the beginning."
5,A Revelation of God's Precious Truths,"This is the first study I've ever done by Beth Moore and it is absolutely wonderful. God truly reveals the precious treasures of His word through Beth's writings. This specific study on the Old Testament Tabernacle is particularly fascinating because of the parallels it holds to the New Covenant in Christ. Going into this study I did not expect to be so thrilled to learn about the Ark and its dwelling, but through this study I am understanding that everything in the Old Testament forshadows God's promises in the New Testament. And all God's promises in the Old Testament are fulfilled in Christ. My eyes have been opened tremendously to the LORD through this beautiful study and I can definitely say I see growth in my walk. I have a heart to know God more and more since doing this study and learning about His glorious truths. I highly recommend it!!"
3,"gwar wanna-bes, but gwar they'll never be","is it my imagination, or are these guys trying to imitate GWAR. they dress up in wierd and funny costumes like them, however, if they want to be like GWAR, they've got a LOT of catching up to do. besides, GWAR would slaughter them."
5,Gordon MacRae - never another singer like him,"I have almost all of Gordon MacRae's cds but I find this one to be the best. His pure voice has no competitors. Only one song on the cd is not his best and that is one of his earliest - I'm Yours but all the rest, as well as those of June Hutton,are wonderful. He was true talent and should have had more recognition in his life which unfortunately was cut short. I have been a fan aince the early fifties and remain so. I would travel anywhere to see him perform. I highly recommend this album especially if you want to hear romantic music. His rendition of I Saw Your Eyes (duet with June Hutton) is my favorite but so is the entire album. Love it."
4,A CLASSIC REDEFINED,"Davidoff launched a new fragrance for men this year (2004) - Davidoff Cool Water Deep. After the success of Davidoff Cool Water one can easily see why they'd continue to capitalize on that name. However, everything about this refined masculine scent is new with a capital N.First, the bottle designed by Thierry de Baschmakoff is a serene, strong ocean blue reminding one of a wave. It's fashioned of smooth, clear glass and topped by brushed metal cap and collar. Handsome.The scent itself is appealing, a bit woody with top notes of zesty mandarin and kiwi. Add sage and cedar needles for a distinctly masculine fragrance, which would be enjoyed by men from teens to late AARP.If you've gift giving in mind, the box is attractive shading from silver grey to dark blue, again reminiscent of a wave.Davidoff Cool Water Deep is also available in After shave Splash, Hair and Body Shampoo, and Deodorant."
1,You've spent almost 30 dollars on this terrible series,"Repetitive, hackneyed, boring, short, uncreative, cynical, and just like bad tv. Be smart, don't give up any more of your hard earned cash for this."
4,Adventure #1!!,"In the third book of the Fearless series, Gaia is on her first real adventure since the reader met her and so much happenes that it's hard to believe that all the events of the story occcured in one day. Sam, who is not on very good terms with Gaia (explained in book #2) is kidknapped under mysterious circumstances that not the reader nor Gaia knows about. The story follows her not only going on several tasks to save Sam, but takes the reader deeper into her past and the past of the other characters. I won't ruin the ending, but it isn't wrapped up in a neat little bow and solved happily. After the last page is turned, there are still a million questions the reader has. This was a great book in the series because it takes Gaia on her first adventure since starting in her new life. It puts a new spin on her relationship with Sam as well as some people from her dark past."
4,Captures the beauty of France,"This is a coffee table book with literary aspirations, matching gorgeous color photographs of France with well-done prose that gives historical context to every beautiful shot.The focus is on the beatiful countryside, with well over half of the book showing scenes of natural grandeur. Never having been to France, I was surprised to see how much unmarred natural beauty there is in a place with so much history and culture.Nor does Alain ignore the cultural riches that France has to offer. There are the expected icons that can't be left out, such as the Louvre and the Eiffel Tower, but there are also a slew of lesser known sites of historical interest and the art world.This isn't a book that will tell you where the restrooms are, or the best hotels in the area. However, someone planning to visit should pick it up because it inspires excitement by selling France as a repository of magical, intriguing destinations for the wandering heart."
5,Consort Hair spray regular hold,"the price is a little high, but, it is what I wanted. Trying to find regular hold over the counter is becoming harder and harder. I like the way it holds during the day and through the nigit, and in the morning, the way my hair combs out nice and easy almost as if there was no hair spray in my hair at all.P.S. I don't like extra hold because in the morning my hair feels like a tangled web when I first try to comb it."
5,Lovely Performance--what Bellini meant,"This is a lovely, traditionally-thought-out, very pretty and colorful performance. We are in the realm of the true belcanto: that which Bellini had in mind at the time that he wrote this masterpiece. The singing of Eglise Gutierrez is a throw-back to the grand days of the true belcanto singers of the past. Her piano-singing seems so easy! I recommend this DVD very highly; either to avid opera-lovers or to people new to opera; or to this opera."
4,Let the woman sing!,"What we have here is a director's version of Sonnambula. It is updated to the 19th century and is cut to bring out his vision whatever that might be. Not sure this is a good thing. The sets are pretty to look at - lots of color and no trench coats thank God. But why? Well, on the other hand this isn't Hamlet. You don't do Sonnambula for the drama. It is the ultimate canary opera and the canary is in fantastic voice complete with high notes and extended thrilling notes that bring down the curtain. Mei is a wonderful Amina and she and Bros as Elvino make nice lovers who show affection for one another. And Bros has his own high notes as well. So don't try to figure out what the director is doing. Enjoy the colors and above all the singing and you won't be dissapointed."
4,"good tunes, nothing irritating, just let spin away","Solid beats and future sounds make up for a little repetitiveness, though if your like me, a little editing is required to grab the ""good"" tunes from the mediocre ones (fading in and out of the continuous song). And a little ""hall"" effect couldn't hurt either. not bad."
1,Not So Great,A friend recommended this product but I'm disappointed in its results. I find that Dr. Tichnor work better than this product in drying out bumps. I think this was a waste of my money.
1,Steer Clear of This Product,"While this product did get rid of some of my razor bumps on the back of my thighs, it also peeled my skin - skin that has yet to be healed from this. Definitely not worth it, so beware."
4,Great Product!,"Works like magic on the bikini zone! Careful though, with excessive use it can lead to dry, chemically burned skin."
1,who can tell if it even works? Vastly overpriced,"This stuff is supposed to help razor burn, ingrown hairs. Honestly after all the time using it I can't honestly say if it works. What I can say is that it smells terrible. Not a weak terrible smell, but a strong, overpowering stink.It also burns like crazy when you put it on.The Tend Skin company puts out this story about a miraculous discovery - a dentists patient came to him after a tooth extraction and raved that whatever the anesthetic was that he was given, it had cured his ingrown hairs.Well, there are three ingredients in tend skin - alcohol, glycerin, and aspirin. Thats it.So apparently this dental patient had been cured of ingrown hairs by taking an aspirin.Bottom line is, this product is insanely overpriced, and they hide it with this distortion, this silly propaganda about its ""miraculous discovery.""A little bottle of alcohol and aspirin should cost a tenth of this."
5,Tend Skin Review,Tend Skin has done an amazing job clearing up my skin. I have had trouble with acne and small red bumps on my arms. Each night I wipe my arms and back with Tend Skin and with in a few days the bumps and acne clear up. I have found no other product with the efficacy of Tend Skin.
4,It really works!!,"I was skeptical about buying this product b/c it was recommended by someone on a website, but this product honestly works to keep away those annoying bikini bumps."
1,Disappointing!!!,This product does not work. I have tried this product over the past few months and have seen no improvement in ingrown hairs or irritation. This product is overpriced for its ingredients and lack of effectiveness. It is essentially alcohol and salicylic acid. I would not recommend this product.
4,Great for razor bumps,"This product works very well. I work in the skin care industry, and I decided to use the product after my boss told me she uses it for her bikini area.I always get mild to moderate razor bumps when I shave my neck. The only way I could avoid it was to shave very carefully and slowly while constantly cleaning the razor with rubbing alcohol.Now I shave normally with a regular cartridge razor (mach3) and use Tend Skin afterwords. I do not get razor bumps and I only use very little of the product.****However, the top ingredient in the product is Isopropyl Alcohol. So you should put a lightweight SPF 30 after Tend Skin dries. Lot of people ruin their skin after using Isopropyl alcohol based products and going out in the sun.4 Stars only because they should recommend using sunscreen after use. And, the product smells a little strange."
4,A better product than what I have used so far,Used it and had good results 3 times out of 4. I was impressed however on the results it had on my husband. He ALWAYS gets rasor burns but not after he used Tend Skin. I would definately recommend it!
4,works fine,leaves the skin bit dry but works really well. the price is good and you ll be surpise the dirt it pulls off your skin.
4,Tend Skin,Works really.....the solution is not as strong as it used to be but will work. Works well on hormonal bumps nicely
1,product not worth it,I bought this several months ago to help with ingrown hairs and redness. I use it all the time and I still get the ingrown hairs. It doesn't even reduce them. There is no effect at all. I wouldn't recommend this. I tried it out and it was definitely not worth the money.
1,Not Effective on Old Ingrowns,"My legs are covered in ingrown hairs that are at the very least a decade old. I used two full bottles of tend skin as I wanted to give it enough time to really get through several layers of skin, but unfortunately it just didn't do anything for me."
5,I love this stuff,"I first tried Tend Skin from an article in a beauty magazine. I first bought it from Sephora, and the worker there told me it does hurt when you put it on..but it's worth it. I do agree that it does sting when you put it on after shaving, but it's the only thing that has stopped my sensitive skin from breaking out in rashes or bumps. As far as preventing in-grown hairs, it does help. It doesn't prevent them totally, but with a combination of exfoliating and using Tend Skin, I've found that it works pretty well."
5,Amazing product,"I bought this for my boyfriend, whom has red curly hair. His neck and face was always covered in painful ingrown hairs and occasionally acne. Within the first 3 days of using the product his neck was 90% clearer. He was absolutely amazed!!! At the age of 31 he finally found a product that gave him clear skin. His only complaint was the chemical smell (he has a very sensitive nose), but he was happy to deal with that for the results he is receiving."
2,Suspect,I received the product on time but it smells different from what I remember from previous purchases. I'm suspecting the product has either changed or I've been duped. Don't know what to think.....
4,Bloodpath,"Purchased 107 a couple weeks ago and just got around to watching it. Very solid event overall with a couple very bloody battles. The Guida-Florian match was just flat nasty and entertaining to watch. Frank Mir, coming of his beatdown at the hands of Brock Lesner, puts on an impressive outing aginst always game Cheick Kongo.Mir is noticably bigger and its not fat. I would personally like to see him get another shot at Brock. The main event is Diego Sanchez vs lightweight champ BJ Penn. BJ is a machine at lightweight and have the time looks like he isnt even trying. All tht respect in the world for Diego taking his punishment like a man. This one also has a cut from hell in it. This one is worth the money in my opinion."
5,"It's a ""Harry Porter"" for grown-ups! Great Fun!","This is the kind of book you will want to read every single word of, without skipping anything. The main characters are so real and down to earth, with their passion for chocolate and a soft spot for stray animals, they could be living next door. The problems they face range from unpaid bills piling up and running out of toilet paper to sick children and abusive husbands; something most of us women out there can relate to. The writing style is amazing! The nightmare scenes are so vivid and intense, I had to put the book down several times, almost too frightened to continue. The ending is absolutely priceless! Great story!"
5,Nostalgic Frequencies....,"I originally bought this as a cassette in 93. Back then I loved every moment of the cd, in retrospect, most of Zoo Rave really doesnt stand up vs. the production of today, but still holds its place in history, for me at least. A time where Breaks, House, D'N'B and trance all kind of existed in one song together.I recently purchased the cd and had quite a laugh listening to some of the songs, but was also surprised to find that my favorite track Xenon - Hellfire, was produced by Richie Hawtin and John Aquivava, two of my favorite producers to this day.Overall if you were one of the lucky people to enjoy the rave scene early, when there WAS more of an underground thing, you will not necesarily remember these songs in particular, but the feelings they inspired instead.Overall a good listen if you're into the oldskool."
4,Vintage,"I think the best way to describe this CD is Vintage. A great selection of the different kinds of music Jimmy Buffet has been making on his last 32 albums. Familiar yet not redundant, I like it more everytime I play it. Puts me in a good place."
1,far from good music,"this is the worst cd i have ever heard. i think buffet has lost his mind. trust me, i am a buffet fan, but this is not even music."
5,INCREDIBLE!,"I love every song on this CD. It is incredible! A great mix of cultures goes into this music. Not many artists can pull that off, but Buffett does. If you like the ""old"" Buffett, you'll love this stuff. If you like the ""new"" Buffett, you'll love this stuff. If you never liked Buffett, you'll still love this stuff. This is a ""brand new Jimmy"" that has really evolved since the Fruitcakes album... if this is the direction Buffett is going, he will just keep getting better and better with each new album.Let's face it... the man RULES!"
2,It's too far on the other side of the world,"I'm a JB fan from waaay back, but I just can't warm up to this CD. I have read many of the glowing reviews and have to wonder if they would not have been the same if JB had just hummed the hokey pokey for the entire cut. Africa meets Nashville and the two just don't make a JB album. The Nashville sound crops up in the most unexpected places and has the same effect as fingernails on a chalk board, leaving you with a itchy feeling and wondering how it fits. Jimmy has come a long way in his music style, The last recent departure from the standard Buffett, Don't stop the Carnival, was an interesting album, a very good story, and had several very good songs. This departure leaves me wondering when Buffett will really be back."
3,half baked,"Just played the new lp twice and it starts out fine with two good songs but then slows a bit and finally picks up again towards the end. I generally liked it, but I thought....Jimmy where's the beef?...it,s not in the same league with Banana Wind or Barometer Soup.....maybe next time?"
3,Am I getting too old?,"I've seen Jimmy several times in concert, and I saw him play Jazzfest in New Orleans around the time when this CD came out (which is why I bought it.) It's ""OK"" -- hence the 3 stars, and just not my favorite album. I'd stick with one of the ""Best of"" or live CD's. Just my two cents --- no offense Jimmy --- we still love ya!"
5,Africa Day,"This album effectively gels a lot of Jimmy's recent past into a cohesive story, particularly in light of Don't Stop the Carnival. In Far Side, Jimmy drops the glittery stage style and goes straight to the heart of the matter, and the end result is a soul-stirring blend of African and Caribbean rhythms and melodies. He even wrote a song about the little hotel he owned on St. Bart's (welcome back Norman Paperman).Jimmy's music increasingly reflects the wisdom that can only come with experience (age). It's comfortably nestled into life's slow lane, keen to maintain a wide-angle perspective steeped in philosophy (What if the hokey-pokey is all it really is about?).Don't expect the shallow-but-fun pace of Math Suks and I Will Play for Gumbo. This new sound is slow and delicious, like a silky smooth clam chowder.The album cover and enhanced-CD video are nice, too."
4,LOVED IT,This cd is really good...and i recomend it to other jimmy fans....Its a great beach cd...we loved listening to it on the way to vacation...the Hokey Pokey song is great and Blue Guitar is my favortie...
4,So mellow,"When I was really young, I used to bet the other children that I could swallow loose change. The most I ever did was 78 cents and one of them was a quarter."
2,Disappointing adaptation,"While I admit that no movie adaptation has ever lived up to the novel it was based on, this movie fails worse than normal. If you are a fan of the book by Pat Conroy I strongly urge you to not see this movie. The ending has been changed beyond recognition and the only storyline from the novel that is used is the Will-Pearce story. The movie was ok within adaptation limitations until the end when it fell apart completely."
4,Preparation for a Rook,"Bought the movie for my daughter. She was preparing to enter Norwich University as a Rook. Think it helped prepare her in some way. The movie is fictional, I realize...I also realize there is truth even in fiction. Wish the movie could develop some of the other story lines found in the book. Overall, considering when it was made, the acting is pretty good, thus, four stars."
2,Firm seat,"We ordered 2 Mac Motion Chairs. After a very quick delivery I unpacked and installed the parts. I liked the fabric and the frame was well made. The memory foam was firm and a little stiff and we expected it to mold to our bodies, one 6 feet the other 5. After a few days we were unable to enjoy the chairs because of the firm back-rest. It would continue to be somewhat painful and only various pillows would bring relief. Lucky for us, we bought the chairs from Amazon and after de-installation and repacking we returned these items. Our recommendation is to find a show-room and sit on the chairs for a while to see if they really fit. We could not find a showroom for Mac Motion chairs in our area ( the one listed seems to have gone )."
1,CAME ALL BROKEN UP AS IF IT WERE DROPPED,"I am not sure how it works yet. The unit came looking as if it were dropped. There is heat insulation between the oven and the electric circuit board. This was all broken up inside. I had to take it apart and shop vac it. The circuit board was dislocated from it clips also. I created a heat block with some aluminum flashing to protect the electronics from heat. I will put it back together this weekend and try it. Basically it is fun if you like to take things apart but I have not gotten any further than that so far. Don't even know if it comes on. There is a no return policy so be careful.It looks like a good unit, if it works, but if you like to plug things in and they work I would have second thoughts. I personally like challenges. Getting hungry though."
3,whats the fuss?,"I've noticed that people hand out five star ratings here like sticks of gum . In all my years of buying rock albums I can count the five star stuff on two hands and still have one finger left to tell you what i think of rap music. but I digress, this paticular cd is a competently played piece of pop work, the production is only fair you might as well cross your speaker wires and listen to it in mono. I don't play this very often, but I wouldn't throw it out either. If you like hanson you'll like this but don't expect some thing on the level of Pet Sounds or Abbey Road, (Legitimate five star cds)"
2,Prodigal Misstep,"Procol Harum has always distinguished itself as a highly original band, both musically and lyrically. Their earlier works challenged the listener and offered alternatives to the predictable music scene. Prodigal Stranger, while giving us the core band together again, is an enormous disappointment (I'm being kind giving it 2 stars). Brooker and Reid, always able to arrest us in the past with the force of their creativity, have sold out on this one, reaching for nothing and settling for the lowest common denominator of commerciality. These people should never have let this one out - on their worst day they can top this mediocrity. If you need something current and different by the band, you'll have to check out the excellent solo work by Gary Brooker called ""In This House"". It's a true pleasure. Pass on Prodigal Stranger."
3,Better than anything else available at the time...,"In all honesty, resurrecting Procol Harum without Barrie J. Wilson, was about like the Rolling Stones dragging in U2's drummer to ""replace"" Charlie Watts. In short: sacrelige, Still, getting Gary Brooker, Keith Reid, Matthew Fisher, AND Robin Trower together again was, simply, wonderful. The music was...eh. The music is, in a word, bland. It's just too slickly produced. But the Matthew Fisher/Gary Brooker interplay is still intact, and Keith Reid's lyrics are beautifully cynical as ever. It's just a shame that Trower treated this as a ""one off,"" because the musicians Brooker/Fisher have now drug in to play ""lead"" guitar and drums are just too excessive. Again, it is nice to see and hear Brooker, Fisher, and Reid together again - nice enough to just TUNE OUT the inept drumming and the masturbatory guitarist."
2,A Little let down,"After thoroughly enjoying the intrigue and mystery of season 1, I was really disappointed in season 2. It just doesn't have that ""gotcha"" feel about it to make you want to see the next episode. Could be intertaining to some, but not my bag of tea."
5,A hypnotic beat with amazing vocals.,"Coming from someone who was never a huge fan of Santana, I love this song! I fell into a trance the second I heard Santana's guitar along with Rob Thomas' voice. I immediately went out and bought the CD. You cannot help but swing your hips and rock your body when you hear the beat. Buy it!"
5,It's a catchy song.,"I love Matchbox20 and to hear that Rob Thomas, sang in this song,...really made me more of a fan. I never heard of Santana before,...but from this song,.....I like them too. The song is GREAT and it's my fave. song on radio. It's a catchy song and it makes you want to dance. It's also romantic,...like if a guy wanted to tell a girl how he feels about her."
1,TOO MUCH DESCRIPTIONS,"First of all, I didn't like the long boring descriptions in Love Forevermore. I found myself skipping long paragraphs a lot throughout the book. And secondly, I found the heroine frustrating and sometimes annoying. I did not like the way the hero and heroine in the book committed adultery and I did not like the way the heroine treated her husband. She should've left her husband or divorced him instead of running around with someone else behind his back and therefore humiliating him. Her husband was a good man and shouldn't have been treated so unfairly. I sympathized with her husband more than the couple. Overall, I found the heroine selfish and lacking in common sense."
1,Third Review.,"The glossy covers have started gatting small white spots all over the pages, and I have only used it for no more than 6 Month. BAD QUALITY, don't buy!!!"
2,"Already Released, nothing new","Warning: Everything on this CD was already released, in better form, on 'It Was The Best Of Times.' If you've got that, you've got this one too. There is NO new material here."
5,PUNK!,"Street Punk. You know the kids that walk around in combat boots and have really spikey hair, and they have tons of patches and crap. This is the style of punk they like. I love this CD. Every song is crafted so well. They have a good mixtures of some old songs, and live songs. Love it.1. Time Is Now 5/52. Looks Like Trouble 5/53. Full Circle 5/54. There's Nothing Left 5/55.

5,"IHATEPOSERS, ANTIFLAG, AND CRASS","THE VIRUS IS GOOD. BUT THEY ARE WAAAAYYYYYYYY BETTER WITH MIKE VIRUS. NOW THEY KINDA SUCK CUZ THEY DON'T HAVE ANY ORIGINAL MEMBERS IN THE BAND ANYMORE. IF U AREJUST GETTING INTO PUNK AND LIKE MIKE VIRUS CHECK OUT HIS CURRENT BAND CHEAP SEX FROM SAN DIEGO, WHICH I THOUGHT WAS WEIRD SINCE THE VIRUS IS FROM PHILLY."
2,I think the title is misleading,"This DVD follow ten potential or pregnant mothers. Babies are talked about, but I felt the content could have been better. They show real births. I am glad I am a man. You ladies are great."
2,I brought a birth video,"I did to buy a dvd, and the picture of the women is feeling her tummy. And I said ok I want to buy the dvd, and then it came it was different from the dvd on this site. It was just birth women saiding what they do you to make the mother feel comfortable during the labor and birth, I was very disapointed in it. And then the people I brought it from was trying to make me happy, if they want to do that make sure the dvd you put on this site is the same as what I want to buy from you. That all am saying."
5,Wonderful and interesting,"I bought this DVD when I became pregnant, I wanted to know exactly what was going on inside my belly. It is a fascinating and well made movie."
1,But animation isn't everything when it comes to birth.,"Sadly, this was the Discovery Channel's video about conception and birth in the US and only in the hospital. It includes images of one c-section, epidural injections, women laboring in pain while lying down and medical personnel only suggesting an epidural for pain relief, not a bath or meditation, doula or birth ball. It also included wonderful, imaginative animation for conception and the growth of the fetus. A more balanced film about birth in the US which includes both hospital and home birth is, ""Born in the U.S.A."" by PatchWork films.Can the Discovery Channel please do more research and give us a video which includes the reason the USA has one of the highest infant mortality rates in the world?"
1,Disappointed...,"I was very disappointed in this book, as it seemed awfully ""far out"" and not at all conected to the truth about biking (of course this is just my opinion!). I recommend spending your money instead on Pirsig's ""Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance"" or Haefele's ""Rebuilding the Indian"" for thier viewpoints (and,yes, I admit it!, mine too) on The Ride."
3,Fairly funny movie with stellar cast,"***Waking Up in Reno is a fairly funny comedy about an unfunny subject---infidelity. Billy Bob Thornton is perfect as a southern used car dealer, Natasha Richardson as his overall-wearing passive wife. Charlize Theron plays ""the mistress""; in fact she is trying to be a good best friend to the woman she is cheating and a good wife to her husband, whom she loves. Patrick Swayze plays the victim husband, a really nice guy, but way too nave and totally unable to stand up for himself.The movie is the story of the two couples' red-neck vacation to Reno. There are many funny moments, and overall it is very enjoyable. As you can imagine, the acting is good. It's far from a terrific movie, and it is a ""guilty pleasure"" in a way because the subject is so serious and sad that it feels odd to be watching a comedy about it. Still, I gave it three stars because all in all, it's worth the time spent viewing it.***"
3,BCAA PLUS,"The product I received was not the product that was being sold. I received an older version of BCAA Plus, and even though it was well within the expiration date, I like to be given what it is I have purchased. Not another version. I also recommend getting a powdered BCAA because the pills are pretty large and hard to swallow."
4,What a ride!,"This is music best listened to in the car, driving down an empty back road with the windows or the top down. This album is a joy to listen to from start to finish. The upbeat and slow tracks are well placed in the track arrangement, allowing both blues musicians to take the listener on a wonderful ride. The music has a great soundstage, with Clapton's vocals and guitars feeding out the left channel, and B.B.'s contributions playing out the right channel. The effect is enhanced in a car, with bass guitars and drums coming from the rear speakers, and the vocals and guitars up front. B.B. King steals the show on the album, particularly on ""10 years,"" a track about the King's former lover, and ""3 a.m.,"" which features an extended jam session from both Clapton and King. Any music fan will relish the chance to hear these two greats play such wonderful music together."
3,On The Fence,"I am not going to say that this CD is bad or good because like a lot of CDs, they kinda grow on you. It is a mite too early to judge. Like Eric Clapton's From The Cradle CD, it was okay to begin with, but after ""five long years"" this album is a classic. I reckon this album will be the same. To you fans out there, don't be too quick to judge! You have two legendary artists that knows their stuff. Give it time and let it become part of your life's soundtrack."
3,Great Partners,"17 years after John Hiatt wrote and sang Riding With The King, Clapton and BB King remake the song with this album. An enjoyable listen, the best song is the title tune."
5,I LOVE ANYTHING THE KING IS INVOLVED IN.,"Mr.BB King is the BEST blues artist I know , i grew up listening to BB, My mother and aunt who have since passed away always played his music. I guess it just grew on me and even though I do listen to R&B when it comes to the King I just love him. On my job we are able to use a compact cd player and listening to BB'S music is what gets me through the night. There is one recording i had of BB, called BB KING AND THE JAZ CRUSADERS WITH THE PHILHORMONIC ORCHESTRA that i would give a arm and a leg for.i can't find it anywhere.love you alway BB, katherine ford, kawf@prodigy.neta die hard fan, Katherine ford"
5,"Don't ask, just BUY IT","I'll confess right up front: Anything these two guys care to put together, I'll buy it. How can you go wrong with these two world class guitarists? I've seen each of them in concert several times, and have most of their CD's... this combined effort just MUST be added to the collection."
1,Big disappointment,"I love both of these musicians. I was really disappointed in this CD, though. The recording quality is mediocre -- sounds like it was done in their garage. The songs are all too slow and too long, with simply no variety to keep your interest. I'd definitely recommend you go with either artist's other recent releases instead."
2,Count me among the disappointed ...,This seems more like a ploy to get fans of both artists to fork out the cash. A wholly uninspiring compact disc with nary a memorable tune to be found. The best thing about this compilation is the cover. Wish I could say more.
4,"It's great, but...","These two artist are both at the top of my list of favorites and as wonderful as it is to hear BB King and Eric Clapton together, I can't help but wonder if this recording was done in a hurry. There's some great songs here (especially John Hiatt's ""Riding with the King"" and ""I wanna be"") and some great performances. BB is always honest and real in his delivery, giving you BB and nothing but BB. Eric, on the other hand, seems to sway back and forth, sometimes delivering his signature and sometimes seemingly trying hard to deliver a BB-esque tone and phrasing. Sometimes the combination of BB and Eric is fascinating and exhilarating and other times it is messy and awkward (some people would say that's perfect). Maybe that's the price of working quickly and mostly live. You get what you get, and you work with it. You'll love this album whether you agree with my review or not, because with BB and Eric together you can't go wrong."
2,Like Mom always said...,"Here you have two Greats playing together. I think you might find a few songs you like, but like Mom always said, ""If you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all."". Keeping that in mind, I have nothing more to say and I love the blues and these two artists. Maybe my expectations were just too high."
5,How Can You Go Wrong?,"...when you put two masters together to sing the blues? Put this one in your car cd player, crank it up, and you got the ""key to the highway!"" Excellent in every way. Glad these two got together to duet before it's too late. Ranges from bare bones blues to electric full-out cool."
4,One of the Best Romantic Movies,"First of all, I recommend that all viewers read the book first before watching the movie. In my opinion, the book is better than the movie but I still really enjoyed the film. Mandy Moore is superb in this role and Shane West absoultely shines. You must see this movie if you are a true romantic!"
1,People who HAVE read the book,"Oh my goodness, if you have read the book I can sum up the film in one word -- DISAPPOINTMENT! The title of the book refers to a very important event that DIDN'T EVEN HAPPEN IN THE MOVIE! The whole reason it's called ""A Walk to Remember"" is because the main character was in a wheelchair and managed to walk down the aisle to get married -- that's why it was a walk to remember! But, gee, I guess we can't have people in wheelchairs in movies....seeing this movie and hearing that it got good reviews made me sooo MAD! Save your money, buy the book instead!"
1,waste of time,This movie is pretty bad. I was going to give it a 2 stars but at the end best it deserves is a 1 star because I didn't even found the interest for all the fast forwards. Shows some nice scenes and I guess if you have a lot of time to kill that justifies watching it.
3,"what can i say? the book was good, the movie [was bad]","the movie 'a walk to remember' is nothing like the book. it follows the same plot and all, but there are many things that are different. first off, there's an awful lot of kissing & sensual content in the movie that was not in the book. when people say 'modernizing the book', they mean adding more sex even though the characters in the book are not supposed to be like that. the characters are nothing like they are in the book.so what's the movie about? well, it's basically a knock-off of 'love story', where guy [landon] falls in love with girl [jamie] after she specifically tells him not to fall in love with her because, gasp, she has leukemia! [he finds this out close to the end.] the movie shows how she impacts his life by making him a better person [she's a preacher's girl, he's a bad boy] and how that makes him fall in love with her."
5,OMG DONT TELL ME YOU DONT BELIEVE IN LOVE,i dont know about you all but i totally believe in the quote that is marketed with the movie.it all depends on who is on your side!!!damn straight! i love this movie and it opened my eyes to the whole being in love thing. now i cherish my boyfriend even more than i did before.
5,Fabulous,AN INCREDIBLE STORY ABOUT LOVE AND HOPE. I recommend it to anyone looking for a story that'll blow your mind. Best movie I've seen in years; 5 stars. Stupendous!
1,do not see this movie!!!!,this was the stupidest movie i have ever seen! it had no point to it! mandy moore did bad acting and so did shane west.This is just a movie i would not like to see again.
4,GREAT MOVIE! (guys might not like it),"This movie is a great one. If you have read the book, it's not as much like it as you think it is. Tons of different things happen. I personally think the movie is better. Be prepared to cry!"
3,Wow! I'm Truly Impressed...,"Initially I watched this movie because I had not seen it before. I was like, hmmm well what kind of teen bull is this gonna be? It started off ok, it wasn't bad, wasn't great. Somewhere 15 to 20 minutes into the film it started gaining more and more depth till I almost thought I was watching an entirely different film. I will admit some of the high school stuff was not really original, but the love story between the 2 main characters was where the real magic took place. Their willingness to overcome the adversity of Jamie's(Mandy Moore) preacher father played by Peter Coyote, the mocking of Lance's(Shane West) friends. It makes you believe in love all over again.Can't say enough about this, it truly touched me. Shane West was both likable and heartfelt, Mandy Moore was sweet without being fake or overdoing it. I can't really see how someone would not walk away from this feeling something for these characters. It was warm and charming, hopeful and courageous."
4,A Walk to Rember,"This bittersweet human interest story is a favorite for those who cry at movies. This one touches the heart and shows how young people are influenced by bad behavior when their lives have no meaning or purpose. The story develops when the right influence, who was previously the brunt of everyone's jokes, becomes the instrument that changes a young man's life forever. It also supported the reality that despite adversity, when lives have purpose, good things do happen!"
5,I loved this movie!,"This was positivly the BEST movie of all time. Anyone who has not seen it has missed out on SO much! i'm a big movie fan and have seen lots of films, but this story has so much depth and love that it could very well be THE Romeo and Juliet story of our time. The characters were superb and the actors were amazing. Mandy Moore and Shane West showed me their true colors while acting in this film and showed me that this could very well be the best movie of all time. At the end of the film, I was crying so hard because of the moving scenes. I watch it about twice a week now and stiil cry at the right parts and believe me, i DON'T cry! Watch it now and be forever grateful!"
1,Pass on the movie if you liked the book,"I think if you read the book before the movie you will hate the movie. So many of the wonderful moments that are in the book between Landon and Jamie arent in the movie.First off the movie is set in present day but has a 50's feel to the clothing which is really cheesy. In the book Landon was a somewhat ""bad boy"" because he didnt take school seriously and was a smart mouth, bad by 1950's standards. In the movie they made him be malicious to other people to make him ""bad"".The sweet story of the penny jar and the presents for the orphanage is left out, which I really enjoyed from the book.This is an awful version of a book to movie. If you liked the book I would really pass on this movie it will just frustrate you."
5,A WALK TO REMEMBER,"This movie was great. I wasn't a real big fan of mandy moore and I didn't think she could act at all. But this was her greatest accomplishment of her whole career. This movie is perfect. It makes you laugh, cry and you find out that this was a true story. YOU SHOULD DEFINATELY SEE IT. I GAVE IT 5 OUT OF 5 STARS."
4,A Love Story That Is Well Worth The Time Spent,"While not a perfect movie, this teenage love story is appealing and well worth watching. Shane West (at the end of the film) and Mandy Moore are the characters I wish I would have been in high school. Their romance is refreshing and ends the right way, unlike 99% of Hollywood movies these days. The minister could have been portrayed a bit less stereotypically, but he could have been portrayed worse, too. I knew nothing about this movie when I bought it and am glad I stumbled upon it."
1,FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!,"... The acting was bad and the characters were totally unrealistic. The story is a sad one but they kinda took it too far on that note. And I mean how many times have we seen this? Let's see bad popular boy falls in love with unpopular do gooder girl. This almost never happens in real life people! No matter how many movies you make about it it just doesn't happen! ... Oh and have you noticed that several parts of the movie are laced with this chick's singing? I mean we all know Mandy Moore is a singer, but that has nothing to do with the film! ..."
3,lovely storyline spoiled by lack of chemistry,"i've always held the theory that movies never do justice to the book its based on. this one just confirms that theory again. i can tell from the movie its a wonderful touching storyline and would be even better if the lead actor and actress has at least SOME chemistry. in this case there isn't any. nada. none. mandy moore's acting is strained. its as if at the back of her mind she has to keep thinking, act innocent, act innocent, to the point she overdoes it. she's trying too hard till it comes off as fake. shane west, well what can i say, perhaps i'm a little prejudiced, i've always had a weakness fo sulky boys like him, but he looked like between the two he was the more natural one. moore was the one who failed to respond to him. overall its not a total waste to watch this movie but if you've read the book you'll probably be sorely dissapointed."
3,Watchable. Opening sequence annoying. Acting good.,"This film overall is good, but the opening sequence with ""Cannonball"" music is OVER DONE. The entire song plays and is very distracting to what is actually happening in the film. (Maybe it's just my surround system, but I thought the music overpowered the scene) It appears the film maker stretched the scene to fit the music. Funny how this song doesn't even end up on the soundtrack.Mandy Moore did very well for her first acting job."
5,The most extroidinary love story ever written,"A Walk To Remember was the most extroidinary love story ever written. It is not too much of a tear-jerker (I hate those), yet it's not a movie that you'd want to watch around people that you're trying to impress with your 'coolness,' because it will stir emotions - and ironically 'not with 'death,' but rather with the wonder of seeing a girl's love transfer a hardcore troubled teenage boy into a guy whose capable of carrying on a ,eaningful relationship - and it's done '''completely against his will!''''"
4,"Heartwarming tale, well acted","This is a heartwarming tale that appeals to both teens and to adults who value mature relationships over instant physical gratification. Mandy Moore is an excellent actress who carries the film, and don't be surprised if you end up weeping a bit at the end of the movie. I know it touched me. I highly recommend this as a family rental."
5,Awesome stuff,"This is really good. This is the kind of stuff that really fires my engine and the fact that they are good friends of our band, The Mutiny might make this review a little biased but oh well. I think they are an even better live band."
1,Nearly useless bath toy,"We ordered this bath toy thinking that it would be fun for our daughter to play with. It turns out that it is hard to use and not very much fun. The buttons are difficult to push. When you do push the buttons, the ""action"" is pretty boring. It is also impossible to get the water out of it. The suction cups are also bad enough that our one-year-old can pull them free. A waste of money!"
5,Hercules stickers are worth the money,This set of stickers is great if you are looking for a product that actually depicts Hercules doing his twelve labors and not some silly Disney stuff that never happened. The stickers are well illustrated and are an excellent visual accompaniment to a mythology lesson on Hercules. I also use them to decorate A+ quizzes over the subject of Hercules in my high school mythology class. For just a dollar you get fourteen nice sized stickers that would be appropriate for kids in middle school up to high school. Well worth the price!
2,Not MS's best,"I was kind of disappointed in this DVD. I am a long time MSG fan. But this band seems to be the mediocre MSG. Barden's voice is shot - he has no range at all. Neil Murray is a journeyman bass player at best. He's not a fraction as good as Barry Sparks. Simon Wright does ok on the drums, but I'll take Shane Galas. The cat is out of the bag on this band on Into the Arena. The middle solo that Sparks and Galas used to give & take on is noticeably missing. And lacking. And Barden cannot range the lyrics as before. Plus the song selection basically sucks. Seems to be middle of the road MSG to accomodate Barden's now limited capability. Plus the mixing is off. Can barely make out Findley's rhythm guitar under Schenker's axe."
1,70 Year Conservative Fight,"The 70 year old conservative ideological fight against the Social Security Act is now incorporating the usual metaphors we've come to expect from this Administration: ""train wreck,"" ""bankruptcy,"" ""cancer,"" etc. As long ago as the late 30's, conservatives claimed it would bankrupt the nation. Then it was Barry Goldwater's turn in the 60's, then Reagan's in the 80's. All took their shot at it, but none have come as close to transforming this great program than Bush. All someone needs to do to determine the validity of Bush's claims is to carefully read the 225-page annual report of the Social Security trustees to see that the system is probably in need of a small adjustment (such as those Congress has approved in the past) but the system IS SOLVENT AS IT IS!This book is merely the P.R. hatchet-job by an Administration hack."
4,Great music for young children!,This book is great for teachers who want to share fun songs with their young classes. Songs are what children love!
3,a fascinating read,"Yes, this book was most interesting to read. But two things from me: 1) They got what they deserved! and 2) Note that none of the black sailors survived, and the story admits that they, like the other white sailors who died, were eaten. But after carefully examining the text, It seems apparent that the captain probably shot THEN ate the black sailors. Read it for yourself."
3,"Paid for new, got used.","Item arrived sooner than expected, which was great as I needed for a Bible study. However, I had paid new price for item, and when recieved, noticed there were names written in the Notes pages in back of book. Will probably not trust buying from this seller again."
2,"My 15"" laptop would not fit in the case","When I received the laptop tote, I was very disappointed. Not only would it not accommodate the 15"" laptop but I didn't find it sturdy enough to hold my other supplies. I returned the item and purchased it elsewhere."
5,"A Wonderful, Inspiring Resource","What a wonderful collection of inspirational quotes, one dedicating to celebrating life, yours and others! Not only quotes such as Mary McCarthy's ""We are the hero of our own story,"" which remind us to honor our own path and experiences, but quotes that remind us of the joy others bring to our lives, such as Sam Levenson's ""The simplest toy, one that even the youngest child can operate, is called a grandparent.""What is more, is how the book is organized. Quotes are broken down into sub-categories based on celebrating Today, Special Days, Special People, the Seasons and Yourself. Have you ever gotten stuck about what to write on that birthday card or Mothers Day Card? Choose from the selections to make a simple I love you come across as more thoughtful, as it inspires your own expression!"
3,"No Satin Nickle, But Still Nice","Well, if you are looking for that brushed satin nickle look, this is not it. The finish is smooth and strong, but it looks more like die cast aluminum. I was kind of hoping that the paint would match some other real brushed satin nickle hardware, but it did not really work all that well. Oh well, the finish is strong and seems VERY scratch resistant."
4,Solid product,"I bought this for a 1996 Bayliner 1950 Capri with a 3.0L Mercruiser. Would have given this 5 stars, but I had to grind away part of the steering trim fin on the outdrive before installing. The blades are mounted farther to the rear than the stock Merc props. I've heard that Turning Point props are designed this way for better efficiency. I run my boat at Lake Powell in Utah which is over 3,600 ft elevation. This prop will take me to over 30mph at WOT (measured on GPS), and at 3,500RPM it cruises at 20-22mph and gets 4+ miles per gallon. Not bad with over 600 pounds worth of people & gear on this 18-1/2 ft boat with full bimini top up. Costs a lot less than the Merc prop too. Suites me fine and I sure liked the Amazon Prime free 2-day shipping."
4,boat cushion,A bit cheaply made compared to the old guys but the best of what is currently available. A bit slippery. Use some anti skid fabric under it.
1,"Passionate argument, poor writing structure with biased sources.",The author of this book seems passionate about environmental world affairs. With that being said a lot of the sources were biased strongly in one direction. Also the chapters are very choppy and the transisions are forced. If this wasn't my text book I would have never bought it.
2,Beware!,"I'd have to agree with the other viewer that I'm shocked as well this film was released on DVD. At least the price is in check with the quality, although in spite of this, I still don't it's worth it. I can't understand why a title such as this would be brought to DVD, when so many other quality movies have yet to be released on DVD. And speaking of quality, that's the biggest problem with this movie - it looks like it was recorded from a tv with 'rabbit ears' tuned to a distant station. Picture quality - grainy. I do give it 2 stars though (instead of one), because it's based on a true story, and John Lithgow does a fine acting job."
3,Still Feel Soiled,"There are enough reviews telling the story so I don't feel the need to tell it again. Fact is, I understood the story, making it utterly real. John Lithgow was superb in his role, and Jodie Foster portrayed the character as numb - the only way a young girl would cope with a situation such as Victoria found herself. The editing left a few holes but hey, the acting was fine with two excellent figures doing their best. I would like to have read a book with more details, because it was a fascinating character study, though I still haven't taken enough showers to get the goo off me. At the same time, it was creepy enough to hold my attention throughout the film, proving in my mind that it was a good story. I usually turn off what does not hold interest, and not many movies stay with me for long. This one has. My recommendation is, see it and decide for yourself."
1,Slow and boring,"This movie is very slow and boring! John Lithgow's character is so unappealing and frankly doesn't even make any sense. Jodie Foster is ""dead"", and the plot is so uneffective. Some things are never explained, such as why those two got married in the first place....but it's not like you'll care."
3,Unspoken emotions and motives keep you guessing.,"I enjoyed this movie because it depicted a true situation from the 1800's - young women marrying older men for security, social status, etc. However, marrying for love is still a better choice. John Lithgow was a bit younger - you might enjoy seeing him in this drama. Not a great movie, but still enjoyable."
4,Fun learning aid,I have used this book to teach how to read a clock to two of my children. They liked being able to reposition the clock hands and the rhyming story.
5,no black hands!!,"Well, i have no idea why the creator placed black hands on the baby ALien.....cause he does not have black hands until he has reached adult hood...so they need to watch the movie again!"
1,worthless headset,"Well, this headset looks just like the existing onethat I have, in person and in the photo. But it doesn't work. At all!Terrible echoes, had to stop talking. Tried it multiple times. Its justa piece of junk! Too angry to bother sending it back.Sara"
3,"good workout, resistance band a must","I started doing this video around 5th months pregnant, after not doing much else but the occasional yoga class, so I was not in the best shape. Summer is perky without being annoying and moves at a nice pace, enough for me to feel it but not be super tired afterwards. I was not aware, however, when purchasing that she uses a resistance band quite often throughout the 45-50min. full routine as well as the. 30min express workout. I found myself instead lunging or walking in place or tried substituting with small hand weights.Also, I skipped the section with the abdominal crunches. I was always instructed not to do them during pregnancy but I'm sure she consulted a physician and was given the ok but i'd rather not chance it. The cool down section has good stretches too.Overall it's a good video. Just be sure to get a resistance band to reap the full benefits."
4,Great DVD,"I really like this DVD, the workout for the 1st trimester really works your legs and arms which is awesome. The level of intensity is that of a lot of non prenatal workout DVD's. I was very impressed when I put it in my DVD player for the first time. I cannot comment on the 2nd and 3rd trimester exercises as I have not done those yet. You do need a resistance band for the workout."
4,Good workout,"I am an active person, this video gave me a good workout throughout my pregancy. I just wish there was better background music or an option to play without their commentary. Otherwise, very good video."
4,Good basic workout,"I like this workout video. You'll need a resistence band to do the workout. It's a good all over muscle toning workout. It is broken into each trimester but I wouldn't limit yourself to only doing the trimester workout that you are in. Summer does all 3 workout at 7 months so you can follow the first trimester workout even when you are in your 2nd or 3rd. It allows you to have more variety. I rotate this video with walking, the Perfect Pregnancy workout Vol 1 and the complete prenatal Vinyasa Yoga & short Forms dvd."
4,good workout for pregnancy,This was a good overall workout for pregnant women. Not too strenuous but your muscles felt it the next day. I would suggest this to a friend.
2,Video wouldn't play on our DVD machine....,"I bought this DVD due to all the great reviews it has. As soon as I opened the DVD and put it into my Sony DVD player....it wouldn't work. I know the issue isn't with my player because it plays all other dvd's I have tried. Anyways, I got the DVD to play on my computer but found it to be a real pain. Every time I moved from a standing exercise to a sitting one I would have to re-adjust the computer screen and that's not always the easiest thing to do while being pregnant! Otherwise, I really did feel the burn and thought it was a good work out. I just wish it would play on a regular DVD player!!"
3,Just okay,"Strengths: Different workouts for different trimesters.Weaknesses:- Each exercise uses only one muscle group - not efficient (completely different than Suzanne Bowen's long and lean prenatal video, definitely check that one out!)- requires some extra equipment.- chatting on the video is not a big problem, but other videos have options to turn that off, and this one doesn't.The best prenatal video I ever bought was Suzanne Bowen's long and lean - even my non-pregnant friends say it's a great workout."
3,Good but annoying workout,"I definitely felt the burn with this dvd.. and maybe it's because I'm currently 37 weeks pregnant, but I find Summer's talking through the workout extremely irritating by this point. She refers to your 'booty' quite a bit and just generally talks too much. The workout also does nothing for you cardio wise... you will never get winded. It's great for toning though. I would recommend doing something else if you are looking to keep up your cardio endurance during pregnancy. I'd also mute the dvd after you've done it a few times."
3,Too slow. Ok for 3rd trimester,After seeing all these reviews i wanted to try this DVD. For me this is too slow and boring. The talking kind of annoys me after 2nd time of hearing the same comments. I always have to mute it and put my own music on to make it more fun. the exercise for the 3rd trimester is just ok - mostly in the sitting positions. I prefer 10 Minute Solution: Prenatal Pilates much better.
4,"Summer is annoying, but video is pretty good.","The first time I used this video, I liked Summer's comments and motivation. By the 5th time, I wanted to mute it. Besides that, the video is decent. I think there could have been some higher impact cardio. I always stuck to First Trimester and Second Trimester, as I felt the Third was not enough of a workout. I ran 3-5 miles 6 days a week before pregnancy, so was told by the doctor I could keep up a similar routine during pregnancy."
5,Wish I'd bought it sooner!,"I got this DVD when I was in my 2nd trimester, my only regret is that I didn't order it in my 1st trimester. The workouts are a good pace. I worked out moderately before getting pregnant and this keeps a pace I'm comfortable with. But even if you hadn't worked out before there are plenty of opportunities for breaks."
3,Not what I was expecting,"This workout video is nice for beginners or for somebody wanting a light workout. I would have like that the exercises had options for beginners, intermediate and advance."
4,Incredible,I found this to be an excellent book. The story flowed easily an the author didn't use two dollar words to keep my intrest. I would however like to see the story carry on through Elizabeth and the children. It would be intresting to see what happens to the family. Overall another excellent book.
5,5 Stars is not enough!,"This singer was under-appreciated for a long time, but this CD is almost perfect as Phylis works with old 'Philly Sound' producers Gamble & Huff to give us 'When I Give My Love (this time)', and 'Meet Me On The Moon', 'Living In Confusion', and more. Phyllis' vocals are on point throught the entire CD, but the hits song, 'Don't Wanna Change The World', sticks out from the rest of the songs (and not in a good way either!). While it was Phyllis' biggest hit single, it hasn't aged well, and hearing the Diva rap isn't cool at all.The rare bonus track recorded during the same sessions, 'Hottest Love Around', was previously available on inported editions of the CD, and is now available on the great 'In Between The Heartaches' compilation, which is also a must have."
4,"Excellent content, terrible binding","The chords in this book are very accurate. However, for all you perfectionists, I have noticed one mistake - the F in the verses of ""I'll Follow the Sun"" should definitely be an F7. I agree with other reviewers that the binding is extremely impractical; I always end up holding the book open with my knee as I'm playing. I think I'm going to follow another reviewer's suggestion of getting it rebound with a spiral binding. If it were not for the binding, I would have given the book five stars.The publisher really should put out a 2nd edition of this book with the following changes:1) a heavy-duty spiral binding2) fixing the order of the several songs that are out of alphabetical order3) including ""Free as a Bird"" and ""Real Love"""
4,Great for Beginners,"I'm a beginner guitarist and wanted to learn to play a few Beatles hits. The way each song provides the details for each chord was very convenient for me to skim though the songs and determine which ones I would start with simply based on the amount of different chords needed for the song. I would say that a beginner can easily play at least 5 songs within a week or two. It's a great start, especially when using youtube to hear the song while you practice. Good luck!"
4,This book is exactly what it says.,"No surprises here. All the Beatles' songs, all the chords. There isn't a whole lot to say because I am sure everyone buying this book knows exactly what they are getting. The main disappointment with this book is that the binding makes it very hard to keep the book open while trying to play the guitar, the purpose I am assuming everyone is buying this book for."
2,Disappointed,"I thought ""Ant Bully"" would be a lot like ""Ants,"" but I was mistaken and disappointed in it. What I didn't like about it was the gratuitous rude and uncivil dialogue between the characters which I felt was in poor taste and a very poor example for kids. I would not show it to my grandkids, as they learn from movies and videos and I would not want them to emulate the attitudes expressed by the characters. There are already too much iresponsible and negative attitudes expressed on TV. I am amazed that Tom Hanks and the other Hollywood actors got involved in this cheap take off on ""Ants."" The insects did not even look like insects, but rather grotesque charactures that were unnatural. Made for a quick profit, not any redeeming value."
5,Great Movie,"Im a big 3d fan and this movie has a lots of details and a magnific animation applied to the characters, totally recommended"
3,ups and downs,"although there are qualities to this mouse that have made it hard for me to play using any other. the biggest draw back is how the settings seem to change mid game. in the midst of extreme play suddenly, the mouse becomes so sensitive it is unusable.i have downloaded drivers to supposedly fix it from their site. but suprise, windows doesnt recognize them and wont open them. it comes with no instructions and the support team are a bunch of knuckle draggers when it comes to help. there are qualities that make this mouse great its just you cant count on it to be consistant."
1,Stay away from Razer,"Good mouse when it works. Very accurate.However, the mouse's optical engine died on me within 2 months of use. I have contacted Razer support many times and they have failed to contact me back."
4,A Gift,"This item was very hard to locate and was needed by a mission team to transport to Nigeria along with the associated projector. Amazon made it all very easy. The product was received just in the nick of time, and even though untested, was delivered to the mission field intact by the team. If it was hard to find in the US, just think how difficult it would be in Nigeria. Thanks Amazon for great service."
5,"Great Size, Great Price",I bought this as a housewarming gift for my sister and they love it. It was easy to put up with a traditional hammock stand (not included). The colors are very vibrant and pretty. Although if you are purchasing know that it is not all blues like the picture shows. The reds and yellows are prominant in it but it is pretty still. And the size is great. Both my sister and her husband can use it comfortably!
2,Not a book for small children,"Having never read the story before, I was expecting a story I could read to my small grandchildren. This was not it. Very dry. I'm sure lots of people like this story, but I'm not one of them."
5,brilliant account,"very good brilliant good sounding account of these rachmaninov works, as brilliant as these pieces can sound! little or no sentalmentalities, definitely deserves a place in any rachmaninov collection, holds its own place very strongly against such performances by richter, argerish, rachmaninov, ashkenazy, and horowitz just to name a few"
2,"Tries to be poetic, fails.","This book has its moments when it is clever and funny, but at other times it is puzzling and downright nerdy (particularly the bit when ""Casseopeia"" is randomly thrown in as a worrying result of no more W's). But what is even more irritating than the uneven subject matter is the book's rhythm. Apparently it was more important to present lines of even length on the page than to structure them in a way that isn't tortuous to read. This book was very frustrating to read aloud to my son because the rhyming words didn't match up with the rhythm suggested by the line structure. We love books that rhyme, but this one was a huge disappointment. This book could have been very good with a better editor, but as it is it is just a pain in the neck."
5,Thrilled thank you,Thank you so much - I'm very happy about this purchase.Will tell my friends the shipping was right on time also
1,Not a book on mood psychology as the title implies.,"This book is not a book on mood psychology but propoganda for monotheistic religion, refering to God, always capitalized, on nearly every other page. If i were into such concepts I could easily dilude myself into any state of unphoria without needing a book to help me. The Power of Now by Ekcart Tolle is a much better book that sticks to the topic without promoting any particular faiths or religion."
5,Pandemonium!,"Though not as freaked-out as the earlier stuff, this album kicks a lot of ass. It's more in the style of industrial music. Very bass-heavy and dancey, sporting similar-sounding guitars as the debut. The lyrics as always are doom-prophesies and weird occultist poetry of sorts. The production may be lacking at some points like ""Mathematics of Chaos"", but the songwriting is top-notch. ""Jana"" is one of their most truly beautiful songs."
3,Two months -- quality problem,"So I've had this phone since January (paid way too much ~$500) -- it is somewhat bulky and difficult to use but I read the manual and learned the basics. About two weeks ago the volume disappeared -- phone wasn't ringing (would vibrate though) -- and incoming calls were difficult to hear (speaker phone functionality also died). After spending an hour rereading the manual and going to the website to see if maybe there was a 'hidden' volume dial I missed re-setting, I gave up and chatted on line with Cingular. Only advice they could give me was resetting to the original factory settings -- meaning reload all apps and mail, contacts, etc! I confirmed this with my IT department and noticed feedback on Cingular's chat room that others are experiencing the same problem with this model. If resetting to original factory settings doesn't work then it becomes a warranty replace. At this price, I expected to be 'delighted' unfortunately I am not."
4,Great Phone But...,"This is a great phone+PDA.Phone alone, not so great because it is very sensitive, can't be rough with it.It is Windows Mobile 5, so it crashes :(, I read that AT&T; will offer a free upgrade to WM6Battery life is short.But I love it, it is great having a PDA as a cellphone. You have got to get the Unlimited Data Plan from AT&T; for $40. I installed OctoTalk that allows me to use MSN, Yahoo, AIM, and ICQ messengers and stay connected. I downloaded Skype so I can call for free. All the time connected to my company's Exchange Server.I bought this phone less than a month ago and I am very happy with it. But you can't treat it like a regular phone and be rough with it, need to be gentle ;)Update:After using this cellphone for some time now, I will not recommend it to anyone.Windows Mobile 5 crashes a lot, AT&T; offered WM6 update, but it still crashes. The battery life is less than 8 hours on standby.I am changing this phone..."
2,Battery life is horrific!!!,I am not a power user. All I basically do is have my bluetooth headset on all day and by 4 or 5 p.m. I get a battery warning. I am sorry but in this day and age this is not acceptable. My Wi-Fi is always turned off on my phone to save battery but it doesn't help. I don't use the web either b/c of fear of running the battery down. AMAZON was great and replacing the first phone but the second phone was the same.
1,snoozer,"Roger Ebert was right on. This movie does not need a mumbler like Kietel. anyway, if this is your taste in cinema - you might find these DVD's more entertaining, if you want a haunting film, pick up ""Aguirre:The Wrath of God"" and if you are into a ""one mans mystical journey film"" pick up Andrei Tarkovskys ""Nostalghia""."
4,"For friends who are new to, but interested in religion","1. The best intro to Christianity for people who wouldn't respond well to ""Mere Christianity"".2. I have bought seven of these in three years.If you know anyone who is ""spiritual but not religious"", and is open to learning, this is the book to give them."
2,Not all of the book is biblically based.,"This book starts out ok, but then in chpt.8 the author writes that there is no eternal punishment in hell for those who choose to reject Jesus as their savior. The author rejects Jesus' own words about hell that are in the gospels.(He doesn't reject the scriptures about heaven, however.) This doesn't represent the God of the bible accurately, and is misleading to ""seekers"".God is a God of Love, but also a God of Justice. The choice to reject Jesus is ours, but we must know the truth about the consequences of that choice."
4,As close as you'll get to a pregnant man,"Common Ground offers the rare perspective of a male charting his emotional changes during his (unmarried) partner's pregnancy. Unusually sensitive, but otherwise average, Ashley encourages Jay to keep the baby when she gets pregnant and then tracks how he feels through detailed letters to his brother Douglas, off on a multi-year trip around the world. Ashley chronicles the way Jay's pregnancy and then his daughter, Maggie, change the way he feels, reacts and sees the world.Set in England, this is a very real book, with resonance anywhere. The decay of his urban environment, his sarcasm (a conversation with Jay's mother is a ""earth-to-satellite link-up""), his insecurities transcend gender and place.Common Ground provides a wealth of well-written commonalities for readers without being trite or obvious."
1,Disappointed,"This will be a double rating: 5 stars for the seller and how quickly the item shipped. Unfortunately, the product itself was a disappointment. Vetiver should have a fresh, clean, green scent. Unless I received a ""bad batch"", this scent smelled like patchouly that went bad."
2,Pure Poo,"Waste of money.Fan barely works, so you get a lot of heat in a tiny little space. The ""Surround Heat"" feature is useless.The entire unit is basically useless.Look elsewhere."
1,Piece of Garbage,"This will be going in the trash as soon as we receive an oil-filled space heater. The knobs have fallen off; it rattles extremely loudly; and the power cord gets frighteningly hot. Honeywell used to be a respected name, now it just sells junk. Buy DeLonghi."
1,HZ-3200 disappointing,"Worked well the first time I plugged it in. After that, downhill quickly. Now, it starts-stops-starts,....! I can feel the heat if I put my hand up against the heater, but it does not circulate at all. Very disappointed. I got it to put in room where my dog sleeps.angela417"
1,Barely works,"Don't buy this product. Mine barely heats anything, it would, if it stayed on. The fan and heat just occasionally turn on when it's set at the highest setting. It doesn't heat up anything because it isn't on long enough to do that."
2,Not worth they effort to even buy it,Ya it turned on. Got hot. but the fan wasn't strong enough to heat up any area less than 2 ft around it.
3,"Cute, but not great quality","This is a really cute book as reviews attest. My son loves it. I will say it probably wouldn't make the best gift since within hours of having received it, the edges began to appear worn. The bright green gave way to white, making it look years old after about a week. We have tons of board books, many second hand from other babies, and this is the oldest looking book in our collection, despite being the youngest. The publisher must use a poor quality process or something, too bad because it's a super cute book. We like to read it as... ""peek a who?..."" then turn the page, rather than just ""peek a..."" Not sure why the author didn't maximize on the opportunity to rhyme throughout the book since children love that."
2,problem with the paint,very cute book but the paint was coming off everywhere within about 5 minutes of my baby chewing on this. this has not happened with any of our other board books.
5,surprisingly loved by all,"I have to admit, I am a book snob when it comes to the kids. I am a mother of 3 girls. I was given this book when my oldest was born. We tried several ""first"" books, and this one caught the attention of the little baby every time!Short and to the point for adults, and pleasing to the eyes and ears of babies.My 3rd baby (6 months old) now loves it. She rotates between this one and another and if you try to show her another book she cries and squirms. Overall, we are very satisfied with this as a great way to introduce our babies to books!"
4,"Good, But Nothing Jaw-Dropping","If you are going to get a book along these lines, I would highly recommend the ""Peekaboo Zoo: A Lift-The-Flap Book"" instead While this book, may be interesting for young babies (7-10 months is my guess) it holds no real mystery or fun, and the appeal is very quickly lost for most children I have read it to. Just my two cents!"
5,love it!,This is one of the best board books I have ever come across. My daughter received this as a gift at 5 months old. She loved it then and she STILL loves it (she's 9 months now). She will sit and look at it for long periods of time. It's also easy enough for my 3yo to read so he will sit and read it to my daughter. :)
4,A clutching movie,"The Clutching Hand is a strange movie, with a twist at every turn. The basic outline of the movie is that a doctor has been kidnapped by the Clutching Hand. The Clutching Hand was trying to get the doctor's formula for synthetic gold. The movie is good, but be patient because it starts out rather slow. All in all, a very good movie serial."
4,As you like it.,"Although this is a very interesting and readable book, I prefer to read a more comprehensive researched volume.We can hardly find the new knowledge in the book. In addition, ther are several mistakes or misunderstandings ; e.g. in p.72-73 the author wrote ""flower boys of Silla is notable from the Yin dynasty Korea"".If you like to read one more book about ""same sex"" relationship, you may choose the item, as you like it."
5,iLuv Car Adapter for iPod,"OK, I didn't fully read the description that states this product doesn't fit the iPod nano 3rd generation. However, I placed some padding inside the adapter which allowed the nano to fit snuggly. As a disclaimer, I doubt this is a recommended practice.That being said, this product transmits on the FM frequency of your choice, resulting in excellent sound quality. Also, this adapter can be assembled is disassembled within seconds, even on the first time using the device.A word of warning - even though I unplugged the adapter from the power outlet, the adapter continues to transmit. I'm sure this action will quickly charge down your nano battery. Just be sure to remove the nano from the adapter when you're done."
1,What a piece of junk.,"Where do I even begin to describe what a piece of junk this thing really is?1. Cheap construction all the way around. It figures, ""Made in China""2. FM transmitter didn't even work. I tried several white noise frequencies and nothing at all except silence.3. The power plug doesn't connect well at all and occasionally losses connection.4. Power plug length adapters would have better constructed if made from the cardboard tubes from toilet paper rolls.5. It does charge my iPhone when, and only when, all the stars in heaven align properly and my iPhone is plugged in correctly.6. The swivel (left to right and right to left) is way too loose. It swings right into the way of my shifter.7. LCD screen is impossible to read during daylight hours.My only advice..... save yourself from disappointment and DON'T BUY IT!!"
3,Working Out With Some Friends,I was expecting less than I got from this DVD. I am a big fan of the Girls Next Door series so I bought this DVD to complete my collection but now I am actually using it. The production and presentation of the DVD is pretty budget but the contents are useful.Holly's workout is a convenient 15 minutes long and still effective.I have some misgivings about Kendra's warmup as it appears to be amateur camera effects on her dancing around....but the workout is not too bad.Anyone who is a fan of Girls Next Door looking for a laugh or a friend to workout with should get this DVD.
3,Just okay.....,"I love the show BUT this is FAR, FAR from a real workout. Holly and Bridget's workouts are good for days when I just don't feel like getting any cardio done. If you're JUST doing these videos, I mean, it's better than nothing but you have to get in your cardio too. As for Kendra's workout....WTF? Her dancing for 2 minutes was just stupid and awkward."
4,"Fun,Short, and Easy","Some routines are repeated, but still good. I was just a tad sore after I got out of my bed, especially my hamstrings and glutes.Holly and Bridget had great routines. I was disappointed that Kendra's segment was a little less than 10 minutes, BUT her enthusiasm at working out and her tight abs motivates you to work out even harder.There should have been more segments on working out your upper body strength.Overall, it was a decent workout and it should have you sweating."
4,The Power of Positive Headache,"""If the Earth were a globe, there certainly would be -- if we could imagine the thing, to be peopled all around-'antipodes:' 'people who,' says the dictionary, 'living exactly on the opposite side of the globe to ourselves, having their fee [sic] opposite to ours' - people who are HANGING DOWN, HEAD DOWNWARDS while we are standing head up? But since the theory allows to travel to those parts of the earth where the people are said to hand head downward, and still to fancy ourselves to be heads upwards, and our friends whom we have left behind us to be heads downwards, it follows that the WHOLE THING IS A MYTH - A DREAM - A DELUSION - and a snare, and, instead of there being any evidence at all in this direction to substantiate this popular theory, it is plain proof that the Earth is Not A Globe."""
2,coming from a [scient/athie]ist,"the logical premises in the last 1/3rd of this book seemed to be quite a stretch for me to even keep reading. then again i'm not the target audience, and it seemed more a ""ra-ra us"" i'm so glad i'm religious."
5,"Heart, Heart, Heart","This man has Heart and Soul. I have been a musician for over 30 years and I have NEVER heard Slide Guitar like he plays. I discovered this Album from a promo CD in 1995 while working as manager of a record store. Now, I love my hard rock and I love my Beatles but when I heard the first opening chords of the CD I knew I was hearing something special. As I listened to the whole thing I have to say a tear came to my eye hearing the chord progressions and the sound of his Guitar and Voice. Don't worry about comparing one of his Albums to another...This Album stands alone."
5,"Wow, what a picker!","I learned of Sonny from Slacker radio, thank God. I've now bought 3 of his CD's, all different, but all simply amazing and entertaining. As unique as Ry Cooder and as fiery as the come. There's plenty of blues in his playing and songwriting but his New Orleans influences added in make for a potent mix. Great, tight rhythm section, too!"
3,Well it was free ...,"I received this ND filter as part of a package when I purchased a new lens. Compared to my polarizer or close-up filter I think this feels, well rather cheaply made. Part of that might be due to this filter naturally having less glass then either of those two other filters. However, the paint is wearing off and the threading on the filter seems ""not quite right"". On the other hand, it is ""good enough"" that I haven't gotten around to replacing it with another filter so it can't be completely terrible now can it? Not horrible or perfect but adequate for the task. So 3 stars for now!"
4,Tiffen 52mm Neutral Density 0.6 Filter,The Tiffen 52mm Neutral Density 0.6 Filter is a nice start with my experience with ND filters. Give very good results.
4,Pulls You In,"I found this second book in the buddies series to be far more enjoyable than the last, which could be in part because I've now a familiarity with the characters. That being said, some of my favorite sections of the book were his 'essays' about Bud's family, and growing up gay. Makes me anxious to read the next."
2,Lofty writing style,This author is more interested in introducing big words or ones not regularly used than in providing interesting short stories. I was not able to finish this book and don't recommend it. I donated it to a thrift store.
5,i like this,This is a good little metronome with good feel and response. Not any reason to look further for price and quality in my book.
4,I have several,"This device does everything one could expect for a highly portable metronome. I keep one handy in various places that I practice. As mentioned, I have several and have never experienced a failure, other than battery replacement which doesn't happen often."
3,Nope!,"Can barely hear it and it has a tone (beep), instead of a good loud CLICK.Find something else. Pay more money!"
5,Great product!,"I am really impressed with this metronome! It has all the features I wanted, even some things that were kind of extra but that I really like having available! The volume would not be enough for a loud and more advanced piece of music, but you could glance at the on screen metronome. It works for me, as my piano students are all in early levels, and it is loud enough for them to play to. Easy to set, practical size, and good sound. Would definitely recommend!"
4,good product,"This product is nothing special nor extraordinay. It is just a simple and fragil and cheap digital metronome. Sounds good, is programmable. Nothing exceptional. The delivery was rapid. It will be useful. That's all"
5,Music - Band,I received the Metronome in a very timely manner and it is helping my daughter very much in her flute playing. Thanks for your quick response.
2,It's ok,"It's ok in that maybe I'm the one that doesn't understand how to use it that well..,so I guess I can say that it's a little bit complicated. It was cheap and maybe if you are a professional musician it wouldn't be for you but for someone who is just starting to learn music it'll do the job."
4,OK and worth a watch,"You should watch this to see what can be done on ultra low budgets. The acting is so-so, aliens and tech sets look like Japanese sci-fi imports. It's fun and John Agar is in it. Just don't ask your wife/GF/significant female other to watch...my wife, daughter and friend all hated it. The guys say it's OK"
4,Great item,This product works great. Very bright will light up my whole backyard. Lights are visable in the pool. Has about 8 different light displays to choose from. very satified.
4,Does size matter?,"It's the middle of winter, so this bad boy isn't going in the pool for a while, but I was surprised by how small it was... about 1/2 the size of a basketball. Not sure if the ""big things in little packages"" analogy will apply. I'm expecting to need at least another three for a normal size in-ground back yard pool.It does look neat though and I can't wait to try it.Seems a bit expensive if I'm going to need more. We'll see."
2,not for swimming pools,You really need lots of them to illuminate your swimming pool. They ended in the bathtube were my kids play with them. I was very dissappointed....
2,Wish it was as cool as the photo!,"This LED light wasn't very bright. It didn't shine over a large surface area, and was nowhere near as bright as the photo. I even tried different sets of new batteries."
1,Another false ad,"This product does not live up to the claims nor the picture. It does not glow the way they claim it does. I have an above ground pool and the water stays clear and the AquaGlow can barely be seen on the bottom of the pool. It shines great out of water though. I replace the batteries several time thinking that would help, it didn't. Do not buy this product. You'll be disappointed !!"
2,Not satisfied,Product lights up very small area. My pool is small and 4.5 ft at the deepest party. I think I would need at least 4 of these to give an effect similar to the picture. Very ineffective.
2,not worth it,I was very excited about buying this product to light up the pool during my son's birthday party but it didn't work very well. It is supposed to range from 10-15 feet but only ranges maybe 6-8 feet. Also has to be pitch black for it to work (somewhat dark is not enough for it to work at all).
5,Home Owner with lots of Children,We have lots of Chidren that track sand in the house from the beach. This Vacuum is the only one that holds up under these conditions. Great Product.
1,Not as good as they said,"I was very disappointed with this vacuum. My sister-in-law has an Oreck light weight vacuum around this price range and she raved about it. To be fair I will say that it picks up baby powder well on a low pile carpet but it does not pick up sock fuzz at all. It makes me wonder what else it is not picking up. I thought this vacuum was known for great suction ! Also it does not seem to ""glide"" as well on carpet (you have to use some muscle) like some of the cheaper vacuums I have used. There is no adjustment knob either. I would hesitate to buy another Oreck."
5,Great ND filter,"I'm no expert in ND filters, but I'm getting some great shots with this filter. Just got back from Costa Rica and used it a lot to shoot surfers in the foreground and sunset in the background with amazing. Looks like the cover to the Endless Summer movie(s)."
1,1932 vs later versions,"The Laughton film is a classic. Most of the horror is left up to the imagination of the viewer. That's the best kind of horror film. The Brando version is absurd & weird, nothing like the novel. His depiction of the Dr. as some kind of albino is ridiculous. Typical example of Hollywood producer putting up with his nonsence just to get his name on the film, regardless of artistic merit."
4,Island of Lost Souls,"Criterion did a great restoration job on this classic. The fact that it is a pre-code sensation, with a salacious Charles Laughton makes it better still."
5,Lost Souls No More,"Criterion has announced it has entered into a licensing agreement with Universal and will be releasing their restored version of 1932's Island of Lost Souls on October 25 this year.I've picked up a few DVD-R versions over the years too, and am eagerly awaiting Criterion's release.Roll on October!PS - My Star Rating is for Criterion's announcement!!!"
5,Metal Opera,"The roller coaster ride of this album impressed me from the second I bought it and now 10 years later it still grips me. The whole album is an undulating roller coaster of emotions about the clash between what pop culture is trying to feed you and what you accept. If you haven't heard it, listen to it a few times and don't skip around listen start to finish. You'll be surprised at how well the album melds together and paints a clear picture as a whole."
4,Feet on the ground,"Hey, it's like a TOOL love-fest on this page. Anyway, this CD is indeed very, very good, but I don't know if I would call it ""great"" (as I did of Undertow). Eulogy, Forty Six & 2, H., and even Hooker are worthy siblings of Undertow, but some tunes are just fragments of nearly great songs. ***1/2 stars."
1,so boring turn it off pleasse,i can't believe people call this prog it is so boring and theres no shreding how can it be good if he doesn't shred also danny carey is overrated mike prntoy from dream theater is way better if u don't think so u don't know what u r takling abut my drum teacher told me drew carey is not very good and he's a good techer his name is richard baxter and he lives on the street he can play better thyan jim carey any day.go buy train of thought is the best album ever also nick from louieville shut up u r not troo prog u probably liek pain of salvation too.
5,must buy,This is a must have. With amazing gitars and sweet vocals this album has everything. From organ music to a song sung in German. If you buy this album you will not be dissapointed. I wasn't.
2,ummmm.... did I play the wrong disk?,i think i must have missed something... i just re-read these reviews and saw that this disk WAS awesome after all. uhhhh ok... i guess 300 5 stars can't be wrong so i'll try it again. This time i won't listen to it after MASTER OF PUPPETS ... i'll listen to BARNEY or something. that way it will REALLY sound like god's favorite metal album! what a disappointment... you people are either insane or have absolutely no idea what metal really sounds like. geee... it seems kinda cool to be a tool fan... yeah im ON it! think im gonna turn goth too...
3,soundgarden anyone?,just relistened to the album... i've figured it out... TOTAL SOUNDGARDEN ripoff! with a little bit of JANES ADDICTION thrown in. ever listen to BADMOTORFINGER? (awesome) this is hardly innovative though... but... to be fair... i've just upgraded it one star.
2,Good for what it is....,"Talented musicians playing unhappy music for unhappy people. I like to escape the SICK-WORLD, but TOOL & their fans embrace it. You can't deny these guys can play; I just don't enjoy the rather ""gross-imagery"" their fans love. I like a bit more rhythm in music too. This is their best album, and if you like TOOL(or have began to like TOOL) this is them at their peak..."
3,Some great music but.......,"The actual song tracks on this album are very impressive and interesting to listen to but as the rest of the album,well all those interludes are meant to make the album sound like a piece of art as a whole but really its totally pointless for people who have got nothing better to do than listen to quirky rubbish.Anyway, musically brilliant and quite dark sounding but full of nonsense and bollix!"
5,Oh my god,"Simply stated, this Album is nothing but 5 star, 1st class Melodic Metal. Thats right. It's polished."
5,Tool IS the best band in the world.,"I love tool. This cd is there best work. Loud drums, heavy bass beats, Cool and hauting vocals, Tool has every thing every band needs to be good....yeah. I gave it 5 stars but in needs 10. Get it and listen to #1 #2 #3 #5 #7 and #13 for the best songs. Trust me. I know what I'm talking about."
5,excellent.,"tool is defintely the most talented band to come out of the 90s.every song on this cd [excluding tracks that aren't really songs] is a classic, especially aeulogy, h, and aenema.it is really a shame that tool is usually thrown in a group with bands like korn and manson because they are way different and definitely better.you can't miss this cd."
5,Tool,"Aenima is by far one of the best tool cds yet. it is pure lyrical genius. maynards haunting voice traps me in a spell when i listen to it. there isnt a song on the cd that i dont like. the music of this generation sucks but tool gives me a glimmer of hope that good, REAL, quality music still exists"
5,great,"This could quite be the definitive album of Rock-N-Roll of our era. It is one of the best albums I havbe ever encountered. Pink Floyd of today is the best way to put it. Superlative!!!! An absolutely perfect album. Unless you like Conway Twitty. An amazing work. It needs to be in you collection if you are in tune to music today. Does for Rock what Hendrix did for guitar. If I could listen to only one album ever again, it would be this one."
5,unfathomable,"i cannot understand how someone cannot like tool. Ive been reading some of these bad reviews and these people are idiots. One guy, Nick something, said that tool gets shoved down our throats on mtv. Has anyone ever seen tool on mtv? i heard parabola in the background during headbangers ball once and prison sex was on beavis and butthead, but other than that you wouldnt even know tool was a band if all you did was watch mtv. And another guy thought maynards name was steve. Im not gonna say anymore about that guy, he said enough.Tool is the best, buy all their albums, if you dont like it then you are in denial and lying to yourselves. If you haven't seen them in concert, then that just sucks for you cuz the shows are like 20 times better then the albums(...)"
5,the believer in me,"Honestly speaking,this was the first album that my younger brother bought that i actually listened to.it was like sheer amazement for me when i heard tool's music (the very powerful forty six & 2) being played on our cd player which usually burns with RATM cds.Every song is masterfully written and it seems that no other band could rival the riveting power of its sound."
5,A must byu,"Following on from Opiate and Undertow, Aenima again sets the standard for a unique alt-metal music category. This album would have to be my all time favourite, and it's one of those CD's that I don't get sick of. The depth and texure of this album is amazing, and the filmclips show the thought and energy that this album delivers. Tool are a band that are very powerful, and leave your head repeating some of their frearsome riffs."
1,"Wow, what a piece of crap","Tool [stinks]. So does this album. Now, I know that you loyal Tool fans will have me crucified if I don't give a reason for hating them. My basis? Their songs are boring and uninteresting. The only talent comes from their drummer. There is one good song and the rest are fillers. So Tool is indeed a disgrace to all things musical."
2,Unquestionably overrated and unmusical.,"I find Tool to be massively overrated both in the talent and music content arena. As an open minded individual with over 2,200 CD's from all genres, and a musician, I tried very hard to get into this CD, and after repeated listens, came to the conclusion that rock fans simply fall for anything these days! This disc is nothing but annoying disjointed grunts and blurbs amidst angst ridden chords that are very unstructured and boring. The vocals are also very weak and mediocre, with no range. If we were rating garage bands, perhaps I would have given them 3 stars, but given that many fans regard this as rock nirvana, I must conclude that they, and Tool are musically stunted bigtime!"
5,A book that contains all the knowledge for any fancier,"Lyn's work spans years and years of work the value of which is often missed by novices. When you learn to walk, you first must crawl. If a person reads this book as a foundation of the Bullmastiff breed, s/he will be able to hold his/her head up with the best. If you don't you will forever be stumbling through the halls of Bullmastiff fame. The building blocks are here in her book, enjoy them and the years of work Lyn has put in to attain this knowledge, you'll always be glad you listened to Lyn, I am, she has always been my Mentor - thank you Lyn!"
5,If you're new to sewing - get this book,"An excellent book for people learning to sew. With good illustrations and step by step instructions, it made a lot of things very clear to me.Put simply - I found this book to be an essential guide in aiding me in doing things correctly. The ABCs of sewing."
4,"Doesn't have Girlfriend's pop hits, but its more solid","I was hoping for ""Girlfriend II"" with this album and was let down to not have an immediate handful of crisp hits. But over time I realized that this album as a whole is more solid, and nourishing. It has beautiful melodies, lyrics, and of course guitar work. And the piano is gorgeous at times. One of my favorites. Thanks for listening."
5,The Hipster Spies With His Little Eye Something That Begins With--A little-known gem,"Phantom Quest Corp is a poorly publicized title, but a lot of fun. Plenty of laughs, interesting characters, a little fanservice for the otaku set, & a general delight.As for the lead character, she's a little like what Sailor Moon might be, all grown up, if she was a binge shopper & drank too much."
4,God Bad...,"This collection was another one that I brought on a whim. Turned out to be a good purchase. I was a bit let down as it wasn't exactly what I thought it would be, but overall I enjoyed it. You have to love a main character who can't seem to keep her money straight and has a helper who is always forced to worry about the ""bottom line"". Well worth a checkout.."
4,"Great Buy, Great Flick!!","Phantom Quest Corp. an action/comedy film about the drunken, karoake singing,party girl Ayaka and her friends taking on paranormal enemies, from Dracula to a possessed surgeon, mummies, and even magical monks. This Movie is a comedic romp through the world of supernatural events.The only set backs on this flick can be that the theme songs can get a little annoying after hearing them too many times, the series is too short although it was still good. The video quality was also pretty nice, and subtitles were understandable and on que. The plot is sort of like scooby doo without the guys in masks, but more action and laughs.All in all this film is a great buy and worth the money spent. A great addition to any anime collection."
3,Really dull ending.,"Started out pretty interesting, but then jumps around too much. Loses steam in the middle and just barely makes it to a less than satisfying conclusion."
4,Interesting story,"Problem is that there are too many typos, this very annoying. I just started reading Seraglio and it has the same problem. For example: effects instead of affects and many more like this. Please edit correctly."
3,Great build up to a flat ending.,"I always love insight into Pike's Enterprise and was excited to see this book. It in fact gave many of the tidbits that it promised. The story itself was promising in that it built excitement. (It also had some nice discussion on the true nature of the bar). However, it seems like the author pooped out at the end and/or lost interest in the story. There was such great potential for an ending to the story that was never lived up to. We literally got an ""and they all lived happily ever after"" ending. Sending Pike upstairs with a Klingon woman was a low class move as well. I gave it three stars because until the end it was a great story."
2,"Hmm, yeah... ?","In theory, this should be the perfect movie for me: A daring comedy with gorgeous chicks.Well, the chicks are great, and it does have its moments. But in the end, the dialogue and the script just weren't that interesting, sorry. It barely keept my interest past the bikini scenes."
1,"If you liked ""Something About Mary"" -- buy it -- not this!","I've gotta believe that the people writing good reviews for this dog must work for Columbia Tri Star. Even three gorgeous women couldn't keep me from wanting it to be over. There were 2 or 3 ""cute"" parts, but most of the time was just stupid. And not funny stupid -- just stupid. And not sexy -- how can you make Cameron, Christina and Selma NOT SEXY? By making them do this STUPID MOVIE!!If you MUST see it to understand why it is so soundly panned -- rent it, but don't spend your hard earned pesos on buying the darn thing. DON'T ENCOURAGE THEM!!Did I mention it was stupid?"
1,2 hours that I'll never get back from my life,"Cameron Diaz is a very weird actress, because she can do good choices (like ""gangs of new york"" or ""being John Malkovich"") and then you see her in this idiotic so called movie! It's simply not funny, it's just a sorry excuse to show cameron diaz and christina applegate in bikinis..."
2,View at your own risk!,"I saw this during its theatrical run. Great casting. It was especially cool to see Jason Bateman, but it didn't deliver. I would recommend this if you like American Pie, you know, gross out humor with a heart, otherwise steer clear of this one. At the screening I went to everybody seemed to enjoy it, so I could be wrong. One more thing, Parker Posey was seriously underused here, and Diaz & Applegate had great chemistry. Couldn't save this movie though."
2,"A guy movie, only with girls in it","As other reviewers have mentioned, this is definitely not the ""chick flick"" the previews made it out to be. Basically, if you're a guy who wants to see pretty, extremely thin women commit risque acts, this is your movie! See Selma Blair have sex with a guy in an elephant costume! Watch Cameron Diaz and Christina Applegate simulate oral sex while driving! Observe as Christina Applegate uses a urinal in a men's restroom. And so on. The movie is extremely raunchy and juvenile, but without the witty dialogue and distinctive performances of, say, ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back,"" or even ""There's Something About Mary."" I give the movie two stars because it was entertaining, but the more I thought about it afterward the more annoyed with it I became. I would suggest you watch this on premium cable some rainy afternoon when nothing else is on, or rent it once it's no longer a new release and is therefore cheaper. That's what movies like this are good for."
5,Gross-out comedies are excellent!,"When this first came out in theaters, I had no intrest in it. Cameron Diaz has never been my cup of tea. BUT, after this got released on video, a good friend of mine said that she loved this movie and that I would love it (considering that I have a dry, nasty sense of humor). So, I rented it and I spend the next 84 minutes of my life laughing nonstop!The Sweetest Thing is an over-the-top gross-out comedy that will leave you with tears of laughter! Who thought that sweetness could be so vulgar? Let me tell you, vulgerness is reeking throughout this film.This is a great movie to just kick back with your girlfriends and let loose! If you like There's Something About Mary, American Pie, Scary Movie, or Not Another Teen Movie, then you'll absolutely love this movie!Also, the Penis song is worth the full price alone!"
1,Crude Imitation,in which it is established that crude intentions alone do not a crude movie make. least not a good crude movie. it's possible that some of this looked good on paper but the translation is godawful. but then there's no hope for a musical interlude that begins with 'my body is the movie and your penis is the star'. the only possible audience for this travesty is the benighted pubescent who hasn't learned the difference between shadow and act and thus can revel in the imagined taboo subversion. else watch this only if you need your wince muscles tightened. will now return to the farrelly brothers with renewed appreciation.
2,"Nothing ""Sweet"" about ""The Sweetest Thing""","I admit it. I saw the name of the movie, the characters in it and just quickly reviewed the synopsis on the back before purchasing this movie. I was expecting a cutesy movie about a single, commitment-phobic girl who finally meets the guy that forces her to settle down. What I got was a movie my family would be furious if I let their kids watch. The movie is full of songs and slapstick humor of an explicitly sexual nature. If you are buying it for family viewing, you might want to watch it before showing it to the kids."
4,Nice entertainment,"I saw the movie just last nigth and I think it was good entertainment even though I wouldn't watch that movie with someone without being emarassed from time to time.The acting was ok, the plot rather simple and predictible.I may watch it again."
5,The Sweetest Thing is SWEET!!!!,"This has got to be the most hilarious movie I have ever seen! I laughed from beginning to end. Guys and girls will love it! There is just one funny scene after another, some to make you almost pee on yourself. If you want laughter, buy this one but I must warn you not to let young children see this."
5,The Sweetest Thing,A very good movie to watch with adults.. Definitely not for children. I love Cameron Diaz so that is why I bought the movie.
4,Not just funny if you're a girl!,"About a month or two ago, this movie was released in Europe. I saw it in a Sneak Preview. And I have to say it's really funny and refreshing to see this kind of movie from the women's point of view.Yes, it was a perfect movie for my mood. I wanted to have a good laugh, and ""The Sweetest Thing"" definately delivered. From the introduction of Christina's character (by a bunch of frustrated males) to the hilarious scenes when the three heroines go to a nightclub, and Christina meets her match. All three women are memorable, and what's more; perfectly believable. And you can tell (don't leave right away when the credits start rolling!) that the actrices have had a lot of fun making this movie.The strength of the movie is it's energetic pace and it's raunchy humor! In a spotlight review, someone regarded to this movie as a Chick-Flick. I only partly agree. Why? Because this movie is just as funny if you're a guy!"
5,One of the biggest laughs I have ever had!!!,"I don't see how people can sit here and put this movie down. Sure, it might make fun of women, but it also shows them having a great time and living life to its fullest. I recommend this to anybody who wants to watch a good comedy. I laughed so hard! My brother of all people actually took it from me and won't give it back. It is the funniest thing i have ever seen. It has got a killer cast too!! It is a must see movie!!! That is if you don't mind toilet humor! literally"
1,Utter Trash,"Is this what 20-somethings think a fun movie is? How sad. While the trio of girl pals here are certainly fetching and shapely, their dialogue and shallow personalities definitely leave something to be desired.This movie left me cold, I don't think I laughed genuinely once. I can only hope young women don't think this movie depicts any sort of reality--and if it does--hopefully the bright minds that I know are out there will strive to change it. .."
1,This writer has it all wrong,"I only rented this DVD because I am a big fan of the works of Thomas Jane, but found this movie revolting. Can't figure out why such a talented actor would do this. I usually like Cameron Diaz too, but this was terrible. All I saw were 3 badly behaved women doing some very disgusting gestures and hung up on the male organ. Not a movie for a young audience. All the characters were shallow and I didn't like any of them even slightly. I didn't even like Thomas Jane's character if thats what you want to call it. If this writer really thinks this script is cutting edge for women's thoughts they don't know women very well. Any woman who acts and thinks like these characters is exactly that a character. This movie was so disgusting I can't even add it to my Thomas Jane video library. If you have any morale values especially about sexuality I would not recommend this movie."
5,Great sound and quality,"I bought this because the other album I previously owned was too low of a bit rate, this was all 240 kbps or higher which isn't perfect but my previous files were in the low 150 kpbs. The music itself is fantastic and if you like A Tribe Called Quest than this is perfect mix for someone who already has to many songs to choose from."
4,"Good story, history for those who don't remember","Enjoyed this movie. The (i believe) fictional characters provide an entertaining story and backdrop to the real Stonewall event.We tend to forget how gays & lesbians were treated as real criminals as little as 30 years ago - when police raided gay bars just to beat up the patrons, and get their names published in the daily paper, assuring you that you would lose your job and be outted in a very public way. I was cringing in my seat at some of the stuff we had to deal with back then - considering how open we are today. Really makes you think.Nice film with a cute story against the historical backdrop."
5,Stonewall six stars!!!,"I thought I should own and watch this movie, since it was on the birth of equal rights for Gays (being the good little queer I am). It was so funny, and educational. I can not believe I had not heard of it until I browsed the Gay/Lesbian section of Amazon. The acting is great, and the period clothing is dead on. Don't rent it, you'll just want to go buy it afterwards, so put your rental $$ towards to purchase."
4,Great version of the Stonewall story,"All accurate? Perhaps not, but a well told story. The actors do a great job in their roles and any liberties taken with history are either reverential or entertaining. The drag queen version of a greek chorus is too cool."
5,Coffee candy,"I have tried several types of coffee candy and by far Bali's is the best. It tastes like coffee and has a smooth center to add to the coffe taste. If your looking for a great coffee taste in a candy, try these...so far the best I've had!"
4,Interesting and well-written,"Engaging and genuine look at the life and career of an iconic Texas Ranger. The stories are told in vivid and realistic detail, and describe the coming of age of Texas law enforcement (with a healthy dose of old Rangers history mixed in for perspective). The author and his collaborator wrote a book that flows well, and which pulls no punches with regard to Ranger Jackson's opinions on law and order in general, or as to the personal triumphs and tragedies that marked his career and his personal life."
1,Not worth it,"I wonder if these reviewers listened to the same CD as I. If you are a Genesis fan, you will probably not like this. Why? It's a very much sell out record, trying to appeal to radio and the 18-24 crowd. It's full of pointless urban sounds, tape loops and other nonsense that add nothing musical whatsover. The lyrics are particularly week, no Living Years here. There's no acoustic breath on this CD, no interesting musical selections, by far the worst CD Mike has ever been associated with. Go back to the basic's, his first, Small Creeps Day. But don't reward an artist, no matter how formerly great, with a album full of noise, little melody, and not an ounce of heart. Let me put it this way, Phil Collins Disney stuff is better. Okay, that should pretty much do it."
1,Absolutely pathetic,"This watch could be perfect, except they sent me a defective watch that was clearly returned by another customer. It had none of the original stickers that come on watches, and it was clearly opened before. The watch stopped working several times in the first day of wearing it. Amazon, I expect better of you. I returned the watch, what terrible service."
1,Watch lasted 6 weeks,"Avoid this watch. I took a chance and bought this invicta ""dive watch"" because it was $20 cheaper than a similar victorinox watch.Now I see where that 20 bucks went.The first time I ever got the thing wet, not diving but swimming in a pool, it had water fogging up under the glass that never came out. Looked terrible. Then a couple weeks later the thing just died outright. A very poor quality, short lived timepiece whose manufacturer outright lies about its product. ""dive watch"", what a joke. Keep this POS away from water at all costs if you want it to last more than a week.I wouldn't buy another invicta watch. What a waste of $50."
4,"Like the watch, not the size","I like the watch, but was unable to size it properly for my wrist. Could not remove any linnks, only adjust the clasp"
4,Which watch,"I have several Invicta watches, have had great performace from everyone of them. Great style and quality for the money. Would buy again."
3,Timer,"This watch is O.k. for wearing, though it makes a horrible detonator. I set it to blow up in five minutes and instead it blew up in 5 decades. By now my target was destroyed due to earthquakes. It's a little pricy for a detonator and lots of my attempts ended up with someone stealing the watch and me having to detonate it by hand. All in all save your money for a hand detonator."
2,Flaw design or manufacturing process,"It is a fairly good looking watch, the bezel feels a bit cheap but then again it is not an expensive watch. Upon arrival it would not work fine with the crown screwed all the way in, I had to wear it half way through so I would not become slow. This is obviously not any good, although after about a month's use I was able to screw the crown all the way in and it performed well. I replaced it with a Wenger Men's 72326 Battalion III Diver and do not regret it at all, in fact the Wenger became my everyday watch.I attempted to use the Invicta after about a month of no use and it was not running, I had to unscrew the crown for it to start working again. I suspect it has a design flaw which makes the mechanism stop when the crown is screwed all the way in. No more Invicta watches for me!"
4,cool watch!,"cool watch and I like it, so why 4 star!!? my watch crown does not function properly but I did not want to return/exchange."
4,Nice watch for the price...,I was expecting a little bit more. I have a couple Fossil watches that seem quite a bit heavier and better built than this one. Then again they cost about twice what this one did. Overall not a bad watch for the price. If your looking for a nice watch for little money this is your best bet.
2,"Looks nice, doesn't work as well","I had this watch for two years. It certainly looks very nice, it was often mistaken for a Rolex when I wore it. It wasn't without its problems though, the time was never accurate, I had to reset the watch every week because the minute hand would run a little faster than it should. The key issue with this watch was that it wasn't durable for me. I never abused it or wore it while active, I restricted wearing it for business or outings. One day it just broke while I was in an important meeting, much to my embarrassment. I was sitting there and the clasp just came undone, without it having been hit or physically struck.For the price, it's not all that bad, but even for this low price point, I think you can do better."
4,Super good price.,"This watch is super good for this price, lovely look like a Rolex just do not let them see the brand."
5,Neighbor approves of the real thing!,"This watch was a replacement for a fake ""Tag"" that was purchased unknowingly by an innocent, unaware buyer. The owner is impressed with the solid handsome looks as well as the fine movement."
1,Bad Replica,"The Invicta Men's 8932 Pro Diver Collection Watch is a fake! It's a bad replica. Inside it there is a bad battery engine (no brand), I take an inside photo when I must repair it because suddenly stop, but I don't know how I can upload.It's not hermetically sealed. So I don't think that could be waterproof.I really disappointed with Amazon to cover this scam in a 50%off offers."
3,Right for the price,"Some key things to note about this watch:It has Invicta written all over it. Specifically, on side of the case in big letters, on the clasp, on the back of every link and the back of the case.The black ring on the outside of the case is just painted on and seems a little cheap to me. I was hoping it would have been carved into the metal, with black paint put in the resulting indentation.All of the hour circles and hands glow in the dark which I do not like.For under $50, I think it is priced pretty good and close enough to buying a watch at a macy's or kohls yet still getting one that appears to be worth more."
1,upset customer,very nice looking but it broke the very first day i tried fixing the time and date. either very cheaply made or amazon sent me a messed up watch. very upset customer.
4,"Nice watch, very classy.",I like the watch a lot. The only thing I did not like is the fact that the watch showed up and was already ticking; what I mean is: other watches I usually order have some sort of stopper indicator behind the turn screw to keep it from working or operating until first time use. Other than this the watch is an exellent buy!!
2,Cheap quality,"When I received my watch yesterday, there was debris under the crystal. There is no way this watch would of lasted under water."
2,Poor quality,"A few weeks after I bought it I went body body surfing in the ocean and the glued-on bezel ring fell off. The rest of the watch still works fine and I still use it as a beater and beach watch, but I certainly wouldn't buy another one, or another Invicta product for that matter. I suppose I could have gone throught the warranty proceedures, but I didn't want to pay postage. Just not worth it. You get what you pay for - cheap price for a cheap watch."
5,Invicta Men's 8932 Pro Diver watch,This watch arrived well packaged in the expected yellow watch case. I have worn it every day since and it still gets compliments. Overall I have been well pleased with it and it makes a great stepping stone to purchasing one of the higher end Invicta watches.
4,classy and sustainable,A nice piece for all ages and classes.. It can go with anything and the dial and hands along with the movement made it a eyeopener and a gift well liked... You can ususally never go wrong with invicta - rolex - or cartier
1,Questionable quality,Attractive watch. But the crystal broke in the first month. I have never had a crystal break on any watch in the past. i question the quality of materials used.
4,Daw,Good solid watch. The sweep hand doesn't line up very good with the numbers. The only reason I sent the watch back was I'm a big dude and the watch looked like a women's watch on my wrist
1,Probelmatic,"These recorders are the worst. I've owned mine for about 3 years. And yes, they do make good quality DVDs but it is one of the hardest pieces of equipment I've ever used. And, after 3 years the DVD burner just died. I guess I'm one of the lucky ones because I've heard of this problem happening much sooner for some. And, it's near impossible to find a drive to replace it. Buy this if you want but you'll come to hate it in the end like I did."
4,Art supply instruction tome,"The Artist's Illustrated Encyclopedia carries a great wealth of art supply usage & lesson volumes all in one heavy book. I often use it when I get stumped over a certain item, and need to find out about a particular object. It's an excellent recommendation for educational purposes mainly - thank you!"
3,Peppermill & Salt Shaker,"I chose the ""its okay"" rating because, well it's okay. I would not buy this again when in the market for a replacement. The peppermill is kind of difficult to turn. The peppercorns get stuck as you are grinding, so you have to keep adjusting the peppercorns buy shaking it upside down (quite frequently) and the salt shaker really shakes - you have to be very watchful of how much salt comes out of the shaker."
2,"Ok for practice, but skin not real enough","I bought this thinking I would get a better simulated practice for suturing, but I was disappointed at the quality. The skin is very tough even with the appropriate needle sharpness and it is not well attached to the foam underneath making subcuticular stitches nearly impossible. Also, because the skin is so tough the needles bend with minimal effort with the first pass through skin - very unrealistic.You are better off going to the grocery store and buying pig's feet for practice to get that good simulation."
5,just enough support,"I have neck/shoulder pain and got this to support my neck when I have to look down at various documents for more than a few minutes. it works great. It is supportive but still allows motion. The Velcro is perfect. I put it on and take it off up to 10 times in one day, as the type of work changes - I don't need it for computer work. The Velcro still works just fine. Great product."
4,neck support,"Very easy to put on, supports well to keep my neck stable when I need to be bending my head a lot. Does get warm quickly but does what it promises."
3,Only a few good songs,"The only good songs on this CD are the three by Serapis Bey. They are: Paranue, Zoom Zoom Zoom, and Olete O'Lala. Everything else is pretty much garbage unless you have a very specific need."
3,Good capoeira music,"I love the Capoeira songs, but the rest of the album is not so good. Recommended for any capoeirista looking for some new songs."
5,Ignore the haters,"Don't listen to anyone who rated this album lower than 5 stars. This album is a masterpiece. If TooL never made the classic AEnimia, then this would be their best. The lyrics are great, the guitar is good, as well as the bass, the drumming is okay, and the vocals are exellent.Track ratings:1. Intolerance-(4:54)-10/102. Prison Sex-(4:56)-10/103. Sober-(5:06)-10/104. Bottom (w/ Henry Rollins)-(7:13)-10/105. Crawl Away-(5:29)-10/106. Swamp Song-(5:31)-10/107. Undertow-(5:21)-10/108. 4-(6:02)-10/109. Flood-(7:45)-10/1010. Disgustipated-(15:47)-10/10Bottom line: There you go. A perfect CD. Buy this along with AEnimia for TooL's best albums."
5,This cd is unbelievable!!!!,"This cd is wonderful. When I was first introduced to Tool a couple of years ago, I was skeptical because they couldn't be easily pegged into one category. Well, that was the stupidest mistake (by far) that I have ever made. This cd is fantastic because it CAN'T be easily defined. It is raw and beautiful at the same time. And as for Maynard (the lead singer), My God what a Voice. He sounds like some kind of tainted angel. This band has not only helped me learn what music can do, it has taught me that it can be the greatest of teachers, too. I have learned not to place labels on everything, because God only knows what you might miss out on."
5,Great C.D. but Over Hyped,"This is a great C.D. don't get me wrong, I gave it the 5 stars it deserved, but this is Tool's best rated C.D., to me, I think that that is just total bull[edit]. This has to be their worst. I mean, all of the songs grow on you, but songs like Flood and Intolerace are pretty much [edit] if you really listen to them. This is a great introduction to Tool, but Lateralus and AEnima surpass this [edit] like it doesn't even [edit]ing exist. It gets da seal, but only because (not including their debut E.P. Opiate) this was technically their debut..."
5,One of the best ever,"The first CD released by Tool is amazing. Their ability to break the mold is amazing. It may be one of their less experimentive albums, but it is still incredible how unique they sound. Maynard's dark, discordant vocals are truly thought-provoking, while Carey's underlying drum beats are just as interesting in and of themselves. The band's ability to work toghether to create a profoundly new sound is amazing. The instruments blend toghether seamlessly, so that you are not listening to vocals, or guitars, so much as the music itself. I would recommend that anyone who loves music in the least should go buy this now, since it will become a classic, and a staple of the music industry."
5,Tool is superb..,"As someone lucky enough to have seen Tool twice in concert so far, I've got to issue an enthusiastic thumbs up to ""Undertow"".Unlike nima, Undertow is much more of a straight ahead rock record, but with that Toolish twist, giving it that uniqueness that's missing from so many of the other bands of today.Included are two classics, ""Prison Sex"" (with that amazing intro that is sure to provide shivers up the spine) and ""Sober"". But there's more, particularly ""Bottom"" with an excellent spoken word part by Henry Rollins. ""Swamp Song, ""Undertow"", and ""Flood"" are also great.The album art itself is worth the price of the CD. Highly original and something only the guys in Tool could come up with. Be sure to snap out the CD tray to see what's underneath.Great album, great band, this one will stay in your CD player for a long time. It has mine."
5,Tool is just amazing.,Yeah and their music shows exectly that!With anbiemt sort of songs and heavy at the same time tool impresses here. I love tool and i still will keep on supporting them and their music just flows all over while i close my eyes and listing to every single track...Its a rush!
4,Undertow,"This is Tool's darkest album, more ""rock-ish"" than AEnima and Lateralus, with less digital effects, and more staightfoward guitar riffs. Thats not to say that the music is any less complex than normal. Maynard's ingenious lyrics focus on religion for much of the CD, one of Tool's big themes. Every song on the album has a place in my mind, as with every Tool song on ANY album. This album creates a feeling of heaviness around you when you listen to it, like something is dragging you down, like gravity was more powerful. Its hard to explain the feeling, its just something you feel. Its not music, its art. I would recommend you buy it."
1,"The Original Ruled, But this IS the original.","Well I have the original version of the Undertow cd which by the way is fantastic. But I wanted an edited version so I could play the cd in public without offending people by the profanity. I was sorely dissapointed when this cd arrived in the mail. The music is not censored at all. Only the artwork. So now I have 2 copies of the cd. That is totally unacceptable and I don't think it should be sold as an ""edited"" version. It's a friggin trick."
5,One of the most powerful albums ever,"TOOL has proven themselves to be giants of hard rock, and this album is the one with which they proved this. From beginning to end (69 tracks!) it is a powerful, emotionally driven album. Maynard James Keenan writes the most intense lyrics out there, and sings them equally as powerfully. If you need any further proof as to TOOL's music being as good as I say, listen to the sample of Sober. Sober is one of the greatest hard rock/metal songs ever performed. It is the perfect testament to TOOL's greatness."
2,not for me,"Let me admit right now- this band isn't my thing.The opening song called ""Intolerance"" features a loud, grungy guitar riff to open the song. I can tolerate it. I understand it was somewhat original back in the day (even though the idea of opening an album with a loud, heavy grunge rocker has been beaten in the mud in todays world).Many of the guitar riffs sound like they're recycled from old Black Sabbath records and songs such as ""Sweet Leaf"". The looping guitar riff from that song finds it way on numerous occasions on this album somewhere, and I simply won't tolerate that.The lead singer has an annoyingly overbearing ""nervous"" angry sound to his voice that I have trouble accepting as good. All the vocal melodies sound the same. It's like falling in a big pot of grunge riffs and vocals and having a big spoon come down and stir you around and around for over an hour. That's my experience with this album."
4,DirectX10 card from amd.ati.,"The Radeon 2600xt card is small & light, and is cool running, due to it's modern build. It also has dvi-to-hdmi dongle, which can transfer the audio of hdmi connection too. The card has a simple blue heatsink on it, it is not red colored on the housing."
5,Five years old and still works great!,"I received 3 of these bibs for a shower gift with my first daughter. I have used them daily for her, and my younger 2 year old daughter . I am not a fan of just wiping them, so I have always rolled them up and put them right into the dishwasher with the rest of the load for the night. Now I am ordering new ones for my new son. You will not regret buying theses bibs. Don't waste your money on any other brand. These are the best!"
3,Still Point,"It's too hard...kind of hurts the back of my head, would rather have had a softer feel. It's ok, I'll continue to use it, but was a little disappointment in the hardness."
3,Good movie: bad video,"This was a very good movie. It started out slow but the tension builds until you are holding your breath. This said, the quality of the audio and video is poor. Still I enjoyed the performances of Angela Lansbury and Raymond Burr and the plot was gripping."
5,A Great Resource for Crane Enthusiasts,"For a short time, I interned with the editor, Dr. Ellis. He is quite the crane expert and has a way with words that keeps a person interested. The book is filled with pictures and diagrams of all the kinds of cranes in the world. It also shares details on how cranes are cared for in captive breeding programs, such as the one at Patuxent Wildlife Research Center in Laurel, Maryland. I am not a bird expert, but the book was very easy to read and I enjoyed all of the diagrams and photos. Although this is not a book for pleasure reading, it is extremely informative and makes a great resource for any novice or expert ornithologist."
4,"Erotic, Violent, Revenge.","Fast moving, tense, kidnap, rape, murder, and a happy ending. This book has it all. And a little bit of Japanese history."
2,Not the Canon I've come to expect,"The overall picture quality is good. However, picture quality in dark or poorly lighted environment is not consistent. Major disappointment is Canon support. I was unable to upgrade the camera with the latest firmware from Canon website. When contacted, Canon replied with ""sorry, we do not offer any support with firmware upgrade"". Definitely not the Canon support nor product quality I expected."
4,Great pictures,"pros: The pictures are very sharp and operation of the camera is cool. Software is also good, especially the PhotoStich utility, works without any problems on my Win 98.Cons: Need to handle the lens cover with care, looks sturdy though. The multicontroller is a bit of a pain sometimes, mine has a slight problem when erasing images."
5,Dreaming of You is heart warming!!!,"I have watched the movie Selena many, many times.I cried every time,and I just get an inspiration every time I listen to her music.She seemed to be a beautiful person, not just on the outside but inside also.I wonder how her family is today and how they are doing.My 2 small children watch Selenas movie and constantly ask to see it again and again.Its sad that her life ended the way it did just when she was on the rise.Selena ,you are in my heart.TO her family, God be with you... JANICE R., NEW JERSEY"
1,Why????,Why will they put this cd out if she never got to finsh it??? I think this has to be the most wrose cd I have ever herd!!! She has a awsome voice but the songs just don't fit her voice if you know what I mean by that.....I know its not her falt that she sang them..EMI most likey made her do those songs and I truly feel sorry for the woman loseing her life the way she did but I think it's time that her famley puts out more stufe for her fans..Just so you know I am a BIG Selena fan but I think this cd stinks.
5,Wonderful CD,"I really loved the movie ""Selena"", so I wanted to get the CD. I found it on Amazon.com and purchased it from a wonderful company who gives back to it's community. The CD arrived as they described, in it's original packaging and in excellent condition. It only took a few days to arrive and was intact. I would diffently purchase from this company again."
5,I love this.,"I cried when I heard she died, I didn't even know her but I just cried and cried.This CD is perfect, too bad she couldn't finish it, it gave us a glimpse of what Selena was to become, Dreaming of You is one of the best love songs I've ever heard, no wonder this CD was #1 even with her Spanish hits. I don't even understand Spanish but I was really loving Amor Prohibido."
5,THESE ARE GREAT!,These are wonderful books I am waiting on my toes for book #8 ! I have read these all at least twice and they are all great! CCA
1,Attention Ce CD est une erreur,"Pour le prix de $23.99 ce CD ne vaut pas la peine car il ne contient pas le CD Live In Anaheim mme si il est mentionner a l'endos du CD. Tres,tres,décevant"
2,Not very useful,"Talk about ""repurposing;"" I didn't feel there was anything in this book that couldn't be interepreted from a sophmore level marketing class. The number of glowing reviews led me to purchase this book and, after reading it cover to cover, still haven't found anything particularly useful or new. Even the examples on the disk were poorly formatted and not particularly complete or relevant to Internet marketing per se. Nice cover but that's about it."
4,A MUST READ FOR INTERNET CONSULTANTS !,"This book outlines all the ins and outs of what a potential client is looking for in WebDesign, Hosting, and/or Consulting and the obstacles they themselves have to contend with. It gives you the best chance to get in the door and present an effective presentation that will address what the customer wants and needs to know."
4,Just took the test!,"The book covers most psychiatry topics well. I found it deficient in neurology; there were a lot of neuro topics on the test (which I took 2 days ago) that simply weren't covered, especially neuroanatomy. There was a lot more basic neuroanatomy than I expected. I think it's a great review book, but you will benefit from spending more time on a different source for neuro review.1/9/06 and edited to say I passed! Yay! Surprisingly, my neuro score was better than my psych score, which I certainly didn't expect given my feelings about the exam afterwards. I again encourage people to study more neuroanatomy and use a different source than the Mass Gen review for neurology."
1,freezing the kindle app,"Sept 2012 - While the content looks good, this product is not usable. It keeps freezing my kindle for pc app, and others have apparently had the same problem. Do not recommend purchasing until they fix this problem."
2,unpredictable moves not easy to follow,"I bought the video based on the good reviews. When I tried it I found it difficult to follow. I'm just not used to this kind of ""workout"" after using Walking Away the Pounds for months (Leslie Sansone). Richard Simmons is very enthusiastic but the moves and the music are just not for me."
2,For Extremely overweight folks! Not for Me!,"The choreography or lack of it provides no structure or cohesiveness! Richard switches movements constantly, exercisement movements are wimpy! He does one thing for three times, then moves to another for 2 times, another for 4 times! I can't tone or lose to that! If you want to get solid quality choreography and strenous workout do the old Fonda tapes. She is superb!"
4,my opinion,"I find the Richard Simmons tapes the best. I like ""Sweatin' to the Oldies"" the best, Because they are easy to do for all ages. I had done them in jr. high, high school, and now as an adult. in high school i lost 70 lbs. doing this tape. I was also in a car accident 3 years ago and have had 2 kids, and they are helping me to build my strenth in the leg that was broke in my accident. i have just started doing them again and have allready lost 5 lbs."
5,Sweatin' to the Oldies and having fun,"This work out video is the best! I love it because it is fun and doesn't seem like ""work"" at all. It really helps you lose weight and tone up."
5,a garden necessity,"This is the second book of this provider. I have bought the new edition and passed the old one on to some of my customers. This book is a necessity for all southern gardeners. It is complete with images of many plants and helpful information. As a designer of unique gardens for specialty customers, I use it as my main resource. It introduces new variety and highlights usage in the garden for many types of wildlife-butterflies, hummingbirds, other birds, and many other species. I enjoy the format and I think that it is very easy to use. It also contains various growers who are very reliable as I have used some of them. Many thanks to Southern Living for publishing this book."
3,best gardening reference for the South --- except Florida,"this is a wonderful guide to all the plants growing in the SouthEast. i treasured this book thru gardens in maryland, virginia, and south carolina. however, if you move to Florida, this is not the book for you. here, the growing seasons as well as many of the plants change. but it is a fantastic reference for everyone else."
3,Not the best,"This isn't the best CD player, but it does have a few controls that help skipping, etc, so it's not the worst. It DOES have Dora on it and that's why we got it, but as just a CD player I'd get something else."
5,Great Mud Flaps,I love these mud flaps! They are easy to install and look great. I've had them on my Ford F350 dually for almost 6 months now and they stand up well to abuse.
1,Cheaply made garbage,This product was a Christmas gift for a friend. When she unwrapped it and then attempting to use it the tail fell off. The whole thing had cracked and was too wide for the tail to lock into place. In short it had a shelf life of about 5min and looks like it should be sold in a dollar store.
3,For Beginners Only,"I bought this book based on the reviews, and I am dissappointed.I am an intermediate player with a strong desire to improve, and possibly get into coaching after I stopped playing. I assumed that given the book's length that there would be much more detailed discussion of strategy, tactics, drills, etc. However, the book is more suited for a ""coffee table"". Even the description of the laws of the game at the end of the book are not very detailed, and offer no context for understanding current controversies in the sport (e.g. what should happen after a tackle, when a ruck is formed, what is permissible during rucks & mauls).The book is loaded with pictures and the type is very large. It does describe the all of the positions and the basic mode of the play, but falls very short of helping intermediate through experienced players develop their skills, tactics, and knowledge of the rules of the game.Buy it for the pictures or if you are new to the sport."
2,Almost had me fooled,"I got the Maxtor One Touch III drive about 5 or 6 months ago, and from the moment I got it, it performed flawlessly. Then, as of about a week and a half or two weeks ago, it started crashing intermittently.At first, it crashed every other day or so, but for the last two or three days, it has escalated to the point that the drive is now crashing every thirty minutes to an hour."
4,Great fun at the movies..,"Billed as the first Lupin III movie, ""The Secret of Mamo"" is a lot of fun to watch. The animation is not the greatest, but the storyline is interesting and contains some very funny scenes. The action is fast and furious and filled with gunplay and narrow escapes. If you've seen and enjoyed other Lupin features like ""Castle of Cagliostro"" then you will like this one."
5,"On your feet or on your knees, indeed!",I was a teenager in Connecticut at the time this LP was released. The critics didn't give it much in the way of praise due to the dearth of new material. If anything people now had documentation that BOC was one of the best live bands of the period.
3,hard to believe,"This story was just a little hard to believe, with some stretches - I mean, a governess who marries a lord? But if you can suspend reality for a few hours, this was a pleasant and often funny read."
2,A big disappointment,"The subject and beginning of this novel are well done. However, the hero's obtuseness and eventual rape of the heroine, as well as his simplistic character development, makes this book a dud."
2,I didn't like this,"As one review said, ""It is very 'King & I."" But, it was just way too slow for me! It would have made a great short story although it wasn't very long at 360 pages & big print."
3,Adorable but hard to clean,"These bunnies are absolutely beautiful and soft and my twin girls instantly fell in love with them when we gave them to them to sleep with at five months. The problem is that they say they are surface washable only, which is completely impractical, although, I did do that the first time I washed them. It immediately changes the texture and appearance of the rabbit's fur even when you do surface wash it. I now throw them in the washer and drier. The blanket part handles it well, but the bunny fur is now matted and looks dirty even fresh out of the wash. That doesn't diminish my daughters' love of them, however, so really only a cosmetic issue. Still, for as much as they cost, it would be nice if they stayed fluffy past the first wash."
5,My daughter loves this bunny!,"My daughter received this bunny as a gift when she was about a month old. I gave it to her thinking it was cute but not having any high hopes that she would attach to it. My son never had a lovey so I didn't expect her to have one either. Boy was I wrong! She is IN LOVE with this bunny. She snuggles with her bunny every night and really can't sleep without it. She is 1 now, and we are ordering a second one as a backup since I can't imagine life without this bunny! It washes up quite well - I just throw it in with other laundry (on cold) and since we usually need it right away, I dry it in the dryer even though the tag says to air dry. The bunny part has lost some of its softness but with the way she drags this thing around, I have a feeling that would have happened anyway!"
4,Remains the most realistic example of a dystopian future I have ever read.,John Brunner is an excellent author and this book does not disappoint if you like realistic SF. There is no other dystopian story I have ever heard of that comes close to this one. And I love dystopian Science Fiction. This is a harsh and humble look at the most probable future for all of us. It used to be very hard to find. Now it has been reprinted and is available for your dystopian enjoyment.
2,Radio problems,The radio has poor reception. I'd have to hook it up to an external antenna to get any good use out of it.
5,Deeply moving and ultimately inspiring,"In Day Of Reckoning: Columbine And The Search For America's Soul, Wendy Zoba draws upon her experience and expertise as an award-winning journalist to separate fact from fiction to present an informative account and compelling assessment of one of the most startling contemporary tragedies to shock the American public because of its very nature and place -- the deliberate mass murder of children by children within the context of a public school on April 20, 1999. Day Of Reckoning is a careful, literature, accurate account of confusing, controversial events. But it is also a deeply moving and ultimately inspiring and motivating testament of the need for love, tolerance, and the infusion of spiritual values to overcome the isolation, alienation, apathy, and violence of today's secular society that can erupt anywhere and at anytime."
1,this movie stunk,"This movie was a recommendation of some friends. I was very disappointed. Not funny at all and the day after I purchased it, I found it on cable."
1,Avoid at all costs,"The funniest thing about this movie is how many 4/5 stars people actually gave it. It starts off with a few funny scenes but quickly turns for the worst. It is an awkward, hollow script that wastes it's talented cast. I've lost a lot of respect for Favreau and Vaughn."
2,Terrible,"This movie stunk. It took way too long in the beginning just to convince everyone to go to the retreat. Overall, there were very few funny parts. I'm giving this a two because the yoga scenes were hilarious and the women looked great in their bikinis. I like seeing that Charlotte chick from Sex in the City play a role like this. She is amazing."
1,Lack of Code,"Was unable to view the movie via Amazon although other outlets were able to stream with no difficulty. Did report the complication, etc and was still charged for a movie we were not able to watch. This review is more about Amazon customer service or lack thereof than any movie."
1,Where is There a Portuguese Man of War When You Need It?,"Either to wake up the cast or to put viewers out of their misery....Horrible movie, only upside is I took it out of the library so did not pay for this blue-raid sunburn.The cut scenes where no worse than what they left in....I am not strong enough to watch it again with commentary."
1,Worst movie I have ever seen.,"I typically don't take the time to write reviews, but I felt compelled to speak out against this movie. It was absolutely the worst movie I have ever seen. Seriously, it really was. I have seen some really bad movies, but this takes the cake. It was way too long, no real story line, and aside from 3 moments I didn't even crack a smile. I am seriously contemplating a class action lawsuit against Vince Vaughn's Wild West Production Company. I wish there was a way I could go back in time and get my 2 hours back. I will be cursing Vince Vaughn on my deathbed for robbing me of that time. Jason Bateman should also be ashamed. What the heck was he thinking? F this movie."
1,Pirated Movie,"I received the above item today and it appears to be a pirated copy. The standard security stickers were missing and the a stamp of ""DISCO MADE IN MEXICO"" is on the back of the case."
2,I have expected much better for such famous actors!!!,"Well, I was pretty disappointed. There's maybe a lot of beautiful faces, but that's it. Very stupid story.I thought, since Vince Vaughn is playing in this movie that it would be a great movie. perhaps there's great acting too, but not more then that."
3,"A GOOD CAST, BUT LOSES STEAM IN THE LAST ACT!","If you like romantic comedies then this film will appeal to you. It has some very funny moments and the cast is very good, but I found it to be a little too long and in the end it just fizzles out. With a trim here and there it would have been a better film, but it is certainly not the worst romantic comedy I've seen in the last couple of years."
1,boring and not funny,"There really isn't much to say here. The jokes aren't funny, the plot is boring, (most of the funny clips from the preview aren't even in the film). There's lots of scenery and not much else."
2,This movie was funny.... at times.,"I rented this movie. I am glad I didn't buy it. While it was funny and I really laughed at parts. At times, it just kind of stalled. It drug on and on at points. It started to kind of fall apart. They had the story going, then they tried to do to much. During the last 20 - 30 minutes, it really dragged on and on. If you like Vince Vaughn, then you should at least rent this. I wouldn't recommend you buy it though. It just was not good enough for the money."
4,A different film then what the studio's tried to have you believe.,"I'm not getting all the bad reviews. Many reviewers are claiming this is the worst film ever...It's not great by any means, but be fair people it's not all that bad. The film is much more serious and focused on serious relationship issues than the studio's represented in their trailers and overall portrayal of the film. Yes, it does have its funny moments though, just don't go into it expecting Wedding Crashers type laughs, it's not that type of comedy. If you go into the film knowing that it's a somewhat serious film with comedy elements I think you'll enjoy it."
3,What's up with this guy?,"I thought it was really weird the way the author trashed Janis Joplin throughout. His characterization of her was stereotypical and demeaning at best. And his complete and total dismissal of her subsequent work with the Kozmic Blues band and Full Tilt band, (found in his innane synopsis of artists at the end of the book) is also a mystery. Kozmic Blues ""lame"", and Pearl a ""Hollywood handjob""? Give me a break. It makes me wonder how accurate the rest of the book is, although it is an engaging read. Joel, get a grip. Janis was the belle of the ball during the Summer of Love, not some raging egomaniac like you portray her. She was the embodiment of the scene there, and you make her out to be some kind of piece of trash. But then again, you didn't start writing for the SF Chronicle until 1972. So WHERE the hell were YOU during the summer of love?"
4,An interesting look at the emerging church in North America,An interesting book that looks at what is happening across this country in churches and Christian communities from coast to coast.This is not a groundbreaking revolutionary book but it does do an excellent job in advancing the discussion about where the church is and where (a part of it) is heading.I recommend the book to other church leaders. It is well written and contains some of the information that you need to make decisions about the future.
2,Barely Acceptable,"I received this lens as part of a kit when I bought an EOS Elan II, and I quickly realized that I needed to upgrade. The optics are mediocre at best, making it nearly impossible to get ultra-sharp pictures. The price is cheap, and so is the lens; the overall workmanship and quality is low. If you are a beginner just getting into SLR photography, you will be much better served by getting a couple of prime lenses (I recommend 50mm and 80mm) of higher quality. If you absolutely must have a single zoom lens to cover a range of focal lengths, spend $100 more to get the better lens. It will make a HUGE difference in the quality of your pictures."
5,Nice midrange lens,Good lens for price and great if your a beginner or intermediate photographer. Takes great pictures. Shipped out on time.
4,"Get the ""2nd edition""","Note that the second book in the series ""Red Hot Root Words: Mastering Vocabulary With Prefixes, Suffixes And Root Words (Book 2)"" include almost all the words in this first book and some more. So ""book 2"" is more of a second edition rather than the second in a series. So get this only if you intend not to get the second book and want a shorter one than the second. If the child needs lot of practice then probably it is better to get a different book as there is overlap of material between the two."
1,Miller's Pocket Dictionary of Antiques an authoritative A-Z,"I wouldn't recommend this book as it was highly disappointing. I've owned other books by this author and was very satisfied, however, this book covers almost nothing that the others haven'talready covered. It was a complete waste of money....If looking for a good reference book to have at your fingertips -this isn't it!!!"
5,Excellent zoom!,"Great zoom, and autofocus, right now i have the cannon t3i and it works wonders its just a new baby being born."
5,Praise for narrow keyboard ergonomics,"I *love* the narrow laptop-layout keyboard: it's the only one I've seen yet that doesn't stick seven inches' worth of miscellaneous navigation and numpad keys between typing surface and mouse. It eliminates the wrist-and-shoulder strain of right hand jutting out toward mouse. My Kensington trackball can sit neatly close. It's the best ergonomic advance for my desktop experience since switching over to dvorak input.The keyboard alone is worth the price; it was a real bonus to get this gyro-pointer (which used to cost much more!) for free. It takes some practice, but it's the best specialized tool for presentations.Tip: attach velcro patches to crucial keys (return, delete, command) to help you use them confidently while touch-typing. It's especially helpful on this keyboard because there's one column of navigation keys to the right of return and delete.Mac users: use DoubleCommand shareware to fix Windows' switched positions of the command and option keys."
1,Disappointment....,I await each new Dinah McCall/Saharon Sala offering with great expectation. What a disappointment it was to read this latest offering. The book plodded. Pieces finally fit together but it was no great surprise to discover the ending. I expect sizzle and clever and exciting. I got blech. Of course I hung in to the bitter end hoping against hope that the book would pick up.
2,I guess I had taken the wrong pill with this dvd.,"I guess I had taken the wrong pill with this dvd as it's [bad]...any of you remember geforce the tv show in the 1980's well I do, and I was reminded of it today. this is what reminds me of animatrix. I guess I just don't get it or don't like anime, but I can tell you one thing this is just marketing ... as a matrix fan I have to say this dvd is a big let down. it offers no insight into the matrix movie.The sad part is I love cartoons just as much as any other generation x does, but this is just pure marketing...and has nothing to really do with the matrix at all, save your money on this one and besure to thank me later.or goto warner home videos site,...and watch parts of this animatrix show for free. and make up your own mind. I just feel like I had taken the wrong pill is all with this movie and I wish I had my [money]back...waste of time and waste of money as far as I say.."
2,Seven Metals Singing Bowls of Tibet,Thought trying something different would be cool and find a relaxing CD.I think this music is boring and not worth the money.I found no relaxation from this guy and his bowls.I only played it once and cant really remember it too well because once was quite enough.
4,Perfect for chilling,"I like this kind of ""music"" as background when i want to relax and paint - It doesn't interfer with my thought process but it adds a nice background for relaxing and centering"
2,Mediocre - there are better bowl cds out there,"I have to agree with the ""aggravatingly repetitive"" review - I ordered this CD thinking it must be amazing, but the real experience of listening to it was disappointing. Its ok, but very low key and frankly, lacks real healing energy, at least I didn't feel it. You asked for a good resonant bowl cd? I recommend you try ""Sounds of Light"" - its the best crystal singing bowl CD I've ever heard, leagues ahead of Seven Metals."
3,I Told You So-Chino xl,"Chino has never disappointed when it comes to lyrics. This album is no different. The listener must constantly be aware, or they take the risk of missing the next punchline. A few of the tracks were suspect (but that's what remixes are for). Chino says what's on his mind and is a surprisingly good storyteller. His boasting and bragging don't come off...like other artists. He has proven himself true to hip hop from numerous appearances on The Wake Up Show which also served the purpose of keeping his name fresh in the minds of true heads. One word of advice is to not let so much time lapse between releases next time or he may become insignificant. Overall, this is a solid effort."
3,Don't Give Up the Ship: Finding My Father While Lost at Sea,"Mr Steinberg wrote an interesting little true tale. I especially enjoyed two sections of the book. The first section being the look into his father's past. It was well placed in the middle of the book. Until that time the only view given was of the present. I enjoy seeing how a person changes from a brave, young man to a fear-driven, elderly man. The other part I enjoyed was the dialogue between father and son. It is interested to see how they relate to each other. Some of the book is a bit slow. I found the descriptions about the boat alittle too detailed. I know there will be people who absolutely love boats and they will disagree with me. Overall story is interesting and well written."
5,Yum!,This stuff tastes good and it's fun to use! I want to order more of this flavor. It's not too sweet-it's just right!
4,Still Testing,"Does what I expected, still too early to see if it satisfies all my requirements. Very light, good in low light conditions."
3,50mm Lens,"I have had the opportunity to use this lens several times and thus far am happy. I will eventually upgrade to a more sophisticated lens, but for now this will definitely serve it's purpose."
4,"Good Light Lens, but focus a little weird","The camera lens came in the mail super quick, and the lens itself is light. All made of plast, so were the threads. It was okay to me, because it was only $100 and it made my camera lighter. Only downside to the lens is that the focus was on the very end which made me feel as if my fingers were going to get in the shot because my hand was in front of the lens just about. I added a uv filter on the front and it helped some what. Love the 50mm though. Great price for a great lens!"
5,Cannon EF50mm f1.8 lens,"I am just learning how to use my camera and bought this lens to do portraits. I haven't had a chance to use yet, but the delivery time was great!! Well pleased with the quality and timely manner in receiving product."
4,Sharp and light weight,"The lens is sharp and light weight, which I find it very useful in all kinds of site shooting. And it work perfectly under low light condition at such low price"
3,KatieMama,"Honestly when I first got this lens I thought it was wonderful, after a while it just wasn't given me what I was looking for. It is a good lens, yes but not a GREAT lens. It wasn't getting the images tack sharp like I was looking for. There was always a small amount of blur unless the object was standing extremly still....my children don't do that! ;) I still like my photos it takes, but they could be better. I recently bought an 85mm 1.8 and oh my goodness TACK SHARP! That is what I was looking for! Every image is amazing. I have not used the 50mm 1.4 but I may buy that one next to see how it compares to the 1.8 and the 85mm 1.8. If you have the extra money I would go for something a little better."
2,Dont like it,"Autofocus isnt working!!! Only manual mode, Do not buy on the internet because the lenses must be checked at purchase time, I was sad to return back there because of the departure to another country!"
5,nice price quick delivery,great pictures. nice depth of field.make wonderful pictures. it's a must to have lens for any portraits.nice product
3,Not bad..just don't accidently overfill with the batter,"I got this because Cuisinart is a decent brand and i liked the look as well as the fact that it made sticks, which i thought my daughters would like better than round waffles. All in all it works well, waffles don't stick and the different levels do produce a good range of different levels of crispiness/browning. The one thing i dont like is that if you pour just a hair too much batter in it will come pouring out over the front onto the latch and dial when you close the top. This creates a huge mess and can make the latch stick, making it hard to open the unit to get the waffles out. If you under pour, the sticks just don't look as nice."
5,wonderful product!!,"When Cuisinart gets it right, they really do, and this product performs it's duties admirably!!"
5,Very Good Product,My wife loves this cookware. Very well made. Efficient transfer of heat. Easy to clean. Will be adding a few more pieces. Value from Amazon was also good. Recommended.
1,Waste of money,"Unfortunately, I only have bad experience with this lens.it lacks IS to be a decent lens; all the pictures I got with this lens were blurry. While zooming in at 300mm, you gotta shoot at 1/300 or faster to avoid fuzzy image (if shooting w/o tripod) right? Well, how can you do it if the max aperture at 300 mm is only 5.6? Only on a bright cloudless day. What are the chances that ALL of your images you will be taken on a bright sunny day?Or you can use a tripod for all your images.One good thing is, the lens is rather fast when auto focusing.I ended up selling it on craigslist."
2,Review of Cannon EF 75-300 MM lens,"Lens is a good buy considering the price. Does not match up with the much more expensive ""L"" series lens, however would not expect to at this price. If you can work with the need for light with a 5.6, then this lens is definitely worth the price."
2,To old for today's cameras,"Look at the price folks. That says it all! Unless you need this lens for a special reason then don't bother. If you know how to use this lens then go for it. But, as I stated before, look at the price. There is a good reason why it's cost is a lot lower than the IS lenses. If you are going the distance and paying for a state of the art camera then don't ask it to use old types of lenses and expect spectacular results."
4,"A Fairly decent lens, relatively cheap lens","I've been using it a lot since I got it over a month ago. I haven't had any issues with it. I photographed homecoming parades on gray days, portraits, wildlife, and nature. They all looked good. I had no underexposure issues, and my exposure speeds and aperture sizes were fairly well adjusted too. I think that in a field such as photography, this lens is just fine for people starting out or who don't have $1000 to $2000 for one lens.I'm not the greatest at figuring out the distances of lenses, but this one goes fairly far. Be warned though, when extended to 300 or so, the lens gets a tad long, and can be a little hard to hold steady. I don't use a tripod all that much, and none of my pictures were blurry from shake."
4,Good Lens,"I am satisfied with this lens w.r.t the price i have paid for this. $120 is very cheap. Agred, it does not have USM. But i am able to take some good photos with this lens. Though i haven't tried sports photography yet. I would recomend this lens to photography learners, and those does not want to pay more money for USM or IS functionality."
3,Should have kept saving $$,"It is a good product, BUT I should have kept saving money and buy the $500 75-300mm telephoto for photographing college baseball."
3,"If you can afford an IS lens, don't buy this one","This lens is great for portraits if you have very steady hands or with a tripod. I bought this lens about 3 months ago and because I do not have such steady hands my photos lack of sharpness. However in photography you should always buy once cry once, so I do recomend to find a similar telephoto lens with IS capability"
3,Entry level telephoto lens,"not as sharp and definitely not fast for action auto-focus shots.for hobby only use on weekend, this would be okay, I've shot a lot of birds on this lens and they come out just okay, JUST okay. :)The construction is just average, barrel play on manual focus might be an issue for some.If you'll try to shot stunning vivid and fast shots, you might be better off spending a little more and pick the more PRO lenses.This lens is good for sunny days and for the newbie who just want to have a decent focal lenght lens. 300mm is really not bad.I've bought a Canon 70-200mm L IS USM 2.8f lens, big difference, both in sharpness, color and speed and also, really big difference in price too.But, eventually, that's what hobbies are all about, start small and grow, if you have the money, just skip this one and buy the real deal, memories are priceless, capture it the best way you can."
4,abishop,"I've used this lense for about 600 outdoor sports photos for my daughter's softball team. As long as there is plenty of sunlight and you can hold it steady, it takes perfect photos. For less than $130, it's about as good a buy as you will find for a zoom lense. I'm glad I didn't spend $300-400 more for the IS version."
1,one of the worst lenses I've ever had,"this lense is one of the worst EF lenses I have ever had in my life, this lense is pure crap."
4,Good lens but not what I needed,"This is a good lens but, with the built-in zoom on my camera, I didn't really need it. It may just be that I need more experience with cameras and lenses before going for something like this."
2,"Not sharp, Slow aperture and Slow focus","This lens might be okay for beginners, but if you are into any quality photographyGET THE CANON 70-200 L (f/2.8 or f/4 with or without IS)CONS-Slow aperture-Not sharp enough-Not an L-Paint is chipping offPROS- Cheep, (but not worth it unless you don't care for quality)My recommendation... Buy a Canon 70-200 L instead (even the f/4 will blow this lens away)"
3,not bad but clearly entry-level,"For the price this is an ok zoom lens. I'm left wanting an image-stabilized lens though because i have found it difficult to get consistently good results with this lens without the constant use of a tripod. I have years of slr photography experience and a very steady hand, I can get clear shots at 1/20th of a second with a 50mm focal length. With this lens, its difficult even at 1/200th of a second, which is about an average exposure time for this lens in daylight at 100-200 ISO. The lens is also slow to autofocus and somewhat inaccurate, causing some photos to come out slightly blurry. If you really have to have a zoom lens now and can't afford an IS lens, this one's not a bad choice. But if you can wait, save your money and get an IS lens with faster focusing and better optics. You'll be glad you did."
3,Works Well...Sometimes,"After using this lens for a while, I am downgrading from 4 to 3 stars... It works well enough for the price... It works alright if you just can't get close enough with the normal lens that comes with the camera -- however, I've noticed that cropping on a far away picture is sometimes better than the clarity of this lens. Many of the shots have turned out a bit grainy or blurred... but I've also gotten lucky and had some good ones too. So in summary, for the purist, the professional, or that once-in-a-lifetime shot -- absolutely not. For the beginner on a budget, it will do just fine."
3,You get what you pay for,"I bought this last year for bird shooting and was disappointed. The photos came out unsharp and blurry even when using a tripod. Full stop down is bad, but it's alright at 200mm.I cannot recommend this camera unless you are really unfussy about optical quality. It does have a good price tag on it. Rating is really 2.5."
3,Alright for the price,"I am satisfied because of the price. I was expecting a far greater zoom capability, but it's better than the lens that came with my T3. I find no reason to get the more expensive versions with the IS because I have steady hands. I would recommend it."
1,Academic potboiler,"This is a simple, and simplistic, attempt to review the nature of war as regarded by philosophers and ethicists. It may be that it was written so that the author might offer his students, in an ancient and ignoble practice, an intellectually slim volume as the text for a course. If you need something to lead you to primary sources, this might do. If you want an original take on this subject, or even the hint of perspicacious commentary, look elsewhere."
3,"Not all I had hoped it to be, but still some good points","While this name book claims to list over 50,000 names, it is a bit deceiving. The 50,000 includes one name and its variant spellings listed separately, beefing up its numbers. It can be frustrating to find the meaning of a name, because so many variants are listed and only the original name has the meaning. On the bright side, this book does include a wide variety of names not necessarily found in other books and in an easy to read format. As one who enjoys researching names, I found the meanings to be brief and not all inclusive. I enjoyed the most popular naming lists from 1880-1990 and the top 100 list from 1998. It also has a name index by country/language, allowing a direct search instead of flipping through every name. Not a bad book to have in your library of naming books, but certainly not the only one to own."
4,Truly Legendary,"Contained within the pages of this book, is the most notorious of all stories to emerge from the depths of the Dark Ages of European history. Sir Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur is quite possibly the greatest work of English literature and the source of the Arthurian legends, as we know them today. This legendary tale of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table is an exquisite story of adventure, love, honor, and betrayal. Throughout the whole of Malory's story there is the underlying theme that a thing's making is ultimately it's undoing, be it kingdom, man, or quest. Not only is this theme evident in this story but in his own life as well. Le Morte d'Arthur is a truly legendary work of art, given new life in this splendid rendition by Keith Bains."
5,Great music!,"I am not a classical music buff, but this is a terrific and beautiful CD for everyone. Background music or meditation music, the CD works in any situation -- you really appreciate the masters and their expertise."
5,Amazing!!!,"This book, this book, what can I say, this novel really speaks for itself.Loved it, it was a true page turner.It had a little bit of everything you can imagine.It will leave you wanting more, even when my eyelids were getting harder to lift,I still wanted to read one more chapter."
4,Pretty Good,"Nate Kenny is a successful business man worth a couple of million. Married to Monica, Kenny hopes to finally have the family he so longed for by having children. Unfortunately Monica isn't ready yet as she wants to travel and have ""alone"" time with her husband before bringing kids into the mix.Monica begs Nate to wait three years before they have a baby and he agrees. But after the three years are up they discover she cannot have children. To say Nate is disappointed would be an understatement!The story centers on Nate whose selfishness becomes clear when he decides he wants to divorce Monica, but in order for her not to get half of his fortune he has to prove that she's been cheating on him. He puts this in to motion when he hires Lewis Walters.Nate Kenny is the most selfish man I've ever read about! The things he goes through to get back at his wife just because she can't have kids is crazy!!!A great read but the synopsis gave away too much of the story!LocksieARC Book Club Inc."
4,Ordinary People,"This storyline is very reminisent of Shakespeare's Taming The Shrew, but with a delightful twist of course. Nate stops at nothing to get his wife to leave him, and ultimately, he must choose between love, family and money. I really liked this novel a very much aside from the naive wife. Kudos RM Johnson I will be pleased to see what is next."
2,The Million Dollar Divorce,Terrible writing n very precidable..would not suggest this to anyone else..It seems like maybe a first writing..I hjope the other books are not like this one..but I won't find out because I wouldn't take a chance on reading another..I want my $ back from Amazon..
3,Why not remaster?,"These versions of the show in old 1:33:1 format and Dolby 2.0 sound are only a shade of what they could be. Region 2 disks were in widescreen and the show was broadcast in widescreen on FOX. There's still a lot of interest in this series, and a new whole-series set in Dolby 5.1 and widescreen would be a great idea--maybe even in HD!"
2,Region 1 instead of 0,I bought this thinking it was region free and when it came it was region 1. Very disappointed indeed. Not happy
5,Finally,"James Cameron gives a perfect vision of a future where the American social structure has broken down due to a 'pulse' that wiped out all the computer systems in North America turning America into a third world country. Jessica Alba is a phenomenal lead actress that lends emotional depth and a lot of attitude to the role of Max (a genetically engineered supersoldier that has escaped government control) who is forced to play the reluctant hero against government oppressors in order to try to find others like her. I love Dark Angel and am totally stoked it's being released on DVD. Hopefully, season two will follow shortly"
2,Yo! King baby,"This series proved conclusively that James Cameron is NOT the king of the world. He's not even the King of Kensington! (for you non-Canadians Kensington is a neighborhood in Toronto and Cameron is Canadian). This idea is interesting, but the execution was amateurish. For a guy with access to so much money, the series had a pretty cheap look to it. Sets are terrible and repetitive, not to mentinn derivative and cliched. The stories are preposterous, generally speaking. There are a few interesting episodes, worthy of the best television but, unfortunately, they are few and far between. Try to catch the series on TV."
4,Good Show,"On a whim, i go the first season figuring that If it sucked, I could always sell it but no! Its an amazing show and worth the price!"
5,I just finished watching,"Dark Angel was my favorite series on television and I cried when it was taken off the air. For mothers day my husband bought me the full first season dvd collection. I wasn't suprised when I finished and realized that I had seen all but one of the episodes. I very much enjoyed watching them again. This series is the most brilliantly put together show in the history of television. The action, drama, comedy potion they cooked up here is origional, inpiring and unmatched. They have a wonderful collection of cast members and writers. I would love nothing more than to see this show back on tv. It was the only reason I tuned into Fox television. I haven't turned to that channel since they cancelled Dark Angel."
5,"When I read Chapter 6 - On Dadi's Personal Journey, I melted","Chapter 6 truly spoke about my heart, and the heart of every woman who is longing to be heard by the world but is certainly connected with God, and finds companionship with God. I felt every word and every experience. It brought tears to my eyes when I felt that someone can speak such words tha my heart always felt but had no words for them. The entire book is written in an easy, simple and extremely practical way that ""I"" can understand, and so does a 7 year old one too (my son)."
2,Concepts unclear,"I have been teaching undergrad chemistry at Berkeley and only now became familiar with this book. I found it very dificult to follow, explanation of many concepts is not clear (e.g., equlibrium calculations). Problems are much harder than solved examples. I would not recommend (especially not for AP chem in high school)."
5,EXCELLENT GENERAL CHEM BOOK,"I recommended this book for students who are studying general chem. Concepts are explained very well with a lot of relevant pictures and useful examples. In addition to that, the section ""chemical impact"" are well written and proves students that chemistry is a study of living.Sections about thermodynamics, kinetics and electrochemistry are very relevant and it is a very good basic for students who will study Physical Chemistry.(note: This is a review of the book. NOT about how the author dresses to lecture. Only an idiot will rate a book based on how the lecturer dresses.)"
4,Hail Zumdahl!,"This is an excellent beginning text! The illustrations are wonderful, and the examples lay a terrific groundwork for the challenging questions in the back. Additionally, this is probably the easiest textbook to read on this subject."
1,NO Customer Service!,"I bought a Swiss Diamond Cookware Set about five years ago and some of the pans that I use daily are really starting to show ""wear and tear."" I contacted their Customer Service Department who seemed VERY interested in helping me decide whether some of the set needed replacement. I was asked to send pictures online and full documentation on when I bought them etc. etc. I responded immediately with what they asked for!THEN, NO RESPONSE! I even sent an email to the person who originally contacted me...NO REPLY!This cookware is VERY EXPENSIVE! I do NOT recommend it because NO ONE FROM THE COMPANY answered my questions regarding whether it was SAFE TO USE IN REGARD TO WEAR!"
5,ten years!,"we have had our ten piece set for ten years now.i'm not sure whom ya'll are dealing with, but two years ago i had both frying pans replacedwith no hasssles at all.some people may be abusing them with hard plastic utensils or scrapeing them with metal spoons.my large pan is over two years old and i can fry eggs with no oil and no sticking. there are four kids and two adults in this family and we use them all the time.we don't scrub them just a light wipe and they are clean.ps... the two pans were mis treated by overheating by a visiting nurse that couldn't cook water without burning it."
1,Scratched within 6 mos,"I purchased these in November of 2011, and they scratched within 6 mos. Surface not deep. I use only wood and rubber utensils except my balloon whisk is high quality stainless steel, which is supposed to be ok to use. Never dish washed. Well, my husband dish washed two of the pans and the pans now have very small rust specks. Apparently the coating was chipped to the metal surface and I could not even tell until it was dish washed. I am trying to return to the company but I am not hopeful based on other customer reviews. Spend the few extra bucks and get caphalon."
5,Really detailed...,"Covers the 1955-1966 models, cover auto car, including Chevy, Ford, GMC, Diamond T, Reo, International standard and scout. Sections on diesel engines, including caterpillar, cummins, detroit, mack, perkins. Transmission section includes clark, fuller, new process, spicer and warner. Also has some farm tractor engine specs. 1165 pages. Green boards with gold lettering. (My husband says this is really detailed.)"
4,Listen to it twice,Give this album a second listen. I hated it when I heard the first 6 tracks. Dear John was the song that spoke to me. Then I heard unashamed and realized where she was going. Whitney is sharing her heart and soul with us. She is not trying to mesmorize us with vocal exercises she is telling her story. I decided to listen to it a second time and I love this album. She is doing more here to let us know who she is and I for one appreciate that. I actually think the album vesion of Whatchulookinat is better than the Thunderpuss version. I am getting the full intention mix next. Buy this CD it is really inexpensive right now (because not everyone is aware of its true potential) it will get more expensive when the other singles are released.
3,Her Voice alone Carrys the Album:the Album itself so-so,"Whitney Houston vocally alone is as Important as any Vocalist over the past 30-50 years too me.Her Range is something else but the Material She gets too work with at so many times leaves alot too be desired.""One of those Days"" is the cut right now for me.but the Problem I have with her is that alot of the stuff She does is so Formula Driven.I ahven't dug a Full Album by Her Since Her Debut all the way through.but Vocally She is still on another whole Level.I'd give this Album a 2.5 overall but Her voice is a 4 solid.but the material overall doesn't match that Power She has in Her Voice.but She is easily better than 98.9%of the Busters singing out today.Whitney on a Average Day Vocally is Better than Most."
2,Unfortunately a dissapointing album!,"This is a very dissapointing album that was deservedly dead upon arrival in music stores.The numerous drug escapades, run-ins with the law and other problems have been highly adverse to her career and this newest album simply shows an even clearer example of the decline and fall of a great artist.The music is dry, bland, and narcissistic (Correct my spelling if I'm wrong) and this album just misses the mark on many levels. I'm not saying that this is a terrible record by any means but there's nothing that will grab you on here and I feel very dissapointed for this reason."
1,Pitiful - Less than 1 star,"This is definitely the worst attempt at a comeback I have ever heard. Her voice has had it. As another reviewer said ""Washed up"" just about says it all. This is merely a poor attempt to fit in, if you will, with the fresh young r&b talent of today. The TV interview - sickening the way she tried to protect Bobby Brown. She looked out of it. A total waist of time if you buy this cd."
5,Whitney delivers!!,"I love Whitney's new CD....too bad it's only 10 songs...but I like 'em all....and call me corny, but I love ""You Light Up My Life"" and think Whitney does a good job with it. I never heard Whatchalukinat on the radio, but it's pretty kewl. I'd definately recommend it!"
5,Great Album,"This is another great album for Whitney. It continues along the lines of My Love Is Your Love, which was great in itself! My favorite tracks: ""One of Those Days"", ""Tell Me No"", ""Things you Say"", ""Love That Man"", ""Try It On My Own"", ""Dear John Letter"", ""Unashamed"" - that's 7 amazing tracks!!! The other 3 tracks ""My Love"", ""You Light Up My Life"", and ""Whatchulookinat"" are good tracks as well. The only problem is the length, about 40 min. of music, but ut's 40 min well spent!!!! I urge all of you to buy as many albums as possible, I already bought 10 and am giving them out as gifts - 5 regular cds and 5 of the cd/dvd special edition which includes 2 videos and behind the scene footage. It's all about Just Whitney...Let's support her and make this the biggest album of the year!"
3,NOT HER BEST EFFORT,"Whitney's latest cd-Just Whitney, isn't her best effort. It seams that she just closed her eyes and picked the songs for the album. The worest song on the album is You Light Up My Life. the song is too sappy for Whitney's voice ( what a waste) Putting husband Bobby Brown on the album was a joke. I guess she's trying to help his career. On this album there are good moments -- One those Days and she shines on Tell me no. If Whitney wants to keep her fans she needs to return to her original producers."
1,Don't waste your money and spare yourself the disappointment,"I'm a big Whitney fan and I was really looking forward to this album so when it came today in the mail I couldn't wait to listen - I would have better off listening to the snow melt outside my window.The album is melancholy and does not show any of the depth and range of her voice. It seems like it was put together to just get her out there and show the world despite all her problems she can still sing - Well she failed!!! She would have been better off waiting till she could put some soul and power in her songs. I'm very disappointed in her and for the other reviewers for saying it's a great album - shame on them - this album lacks passion and as a result I will never listen to it again. I'm going to put one of her other GREAT CD's instead. Sorry Whitney, this wasn't even a good attempt..."
2,Sadly Not Her Best...,"Whitney's last effort doesn't embraces any of her high notes songs...This album is easy to forget and not a good album at all for somebody like her...with all her talent, The only good songs here are Love That Man(The Best One), Whatchulookinat(So Funky), Try It On My Own(fairly good), OMG but the other songs are just bad, You Light Up My Life(the worst of all, how come anyone with that voice can make this awful cover!), make another album whitney fast, or your career will flop. Not that matters but the photos shoots are the best ones of any album that she have ever made."
4,"This is definetely ""Just Whitney!"" :)","Whitney Houston has always and will be my favorite singers of all time and it shows on this Cd. I especially love the song ""My Love"" in which she sings with her husband Bobby Brown. This cd shows the classic Whitney doing what she does best:singing. I recommend this cd because it is great!"
1,Just Whitney? Just Give It Up!,"I used to be a huge, devoted fan of Whitney Houston, but her dramatic (and continuing) fall from grace has taken its toll on me--as well as many of her fans. Her recent (and laughable) interview with Diane Sawyer did not help matters. Her comment that she makes way too much money to use crack was pathetic.It is truly sad to see such a talented person throw her ""God-given gifts"" into the garbage. I love these people who give praise and acknowledgement to God for their talent, and then proceed to ruin and/or jeopardize it with their lifestyle. It is hypocrisy at its worst.Whitney, if you are so ""anti-media"" and want people to leave you alone, then clean up your life and get on with it. Otherwise, do us all a favor and just retire and go away to a quiet place where you can count your millions. Contrary to what you may think, you do not qualify as a ""diva""; so stop acting like one."
3,Just Whitney's Worst,"First of all i have a big problem with the way the music industry in going nowadays. Singers believe that it is all good to put less and less songs on their albums. Ten songs are too little and too many singers are doing this. Whitney's ten track album is a disappointment. I like 'Whatchalookin At', 'My Love' and 'One Of Those Days', the rest of the album really isn't that good; mainly the song 'Love That Man' which really stinks. Yeah she's all in love with Bobby and stuff but the world really doesn't care. Whitney is no longer hitting any spine tingling notes but stays in her lower range for most of the album. Better luck next time Whitney and the only thing people are looking at, are her bones."
3,its ok not my love is your love,My Love Is Your Love is her best album definately. she still has it goin on with her voice even tho some of the material on here is wack like her song with bobby brown and the song he produced by her and you light up my life how she covered it. the r&B jam One Of Those Days is definately the hottest track on here and i wish wamo would have played it more than they did. Try It On My Own is a gr8 slow song with Babyface. Shekspere is great with her on One Of Those Days & Dear John Letter. She also takes on the critics in Unshamed with gr8 lyrics. Love That Man is kinda cheezy but has hot beats. if only she worked with p diddy or the neptunes this cd woul dbe complete but its no My Love Is your Love her best! reccomended
2,What Do You Get ....,"When you mix a shrewd, druggie who has serious marital problems with a wannabe gospel singer who sings such songs as Jesus Loves Me? Whitney Houston. A singer, once adored, who hasn't made a good album since the 80's. If it wasn't for her stellar voice, she would have gotten zero stars from me. Sorry if my review makes people angry, but the girl has seriously lost it."
3,'I want the old Whitney back',"I have been a big Whitney Houston fan from day 1. Her beautiful, rich, soulful voice penetrated through every song that she would sing. When listening to her songs, I would immediately go into `Whitney Land'!!However, on listening to this album, I was somewhat.... well disappointed is sort of a soft way of putting it, but that's what I'll use.Obviously, Whitney has been going through a very big, and deep rough patch and it has is quite plain to see, that it has affected her mentally and spiritually (and I don't mean that to be a disrespectful comment).Unfortunately, she has let fame, and the media get to her and, in my opinion, this album was all about trying to prove that `she loved her man'.I suggest that you don't rush to buy this album, but listen to some of the tracks first, then if it calls to you, fair enough. But you have been warned!!"
2,So-So...,"The first one of these I bought died within an hour of use, so I exchanged it for a new one, which is working so far. The fact that it has a volume control is a plus. The unit gives the impression of being very delicate, even flimsy. The clip that secures the metronome to the ear is so flexible that it comes off very easily. The buttons are positioned such that it's difficult to handle the metronome without accidentally changing the settings or turning it off. The beat sound is a rather annoying chirp rather than a solid click. Price is high for what you get. I would have given it three stars if the first one I bought hadn't been essentially DOA, but since it was, I am giving it two stars."
1,This book is BORING,I purchased this book because it was recommended by the home school curriculum I was using as additional reading material. I was very disappointed with this book - it is plain boring. I did not see its value or its relevance to the curriculum we were studying. It is not something my kids would read again and again - I could barely get them to sit through it once.
1,VERY DECEPTIVE PICTURES!!! YOU ONLY GET ONE MAGNET!,"The package in the display photo shows a TWO magnet set, However if you read the fine print, YOU ONLY GET ONE MAGNET FOR THIS PRICE.VERY DECEPTIVE SALES PRACTICES."
5,I love this guy!,Think John Prine.Similar vocals. Great tunes. Clever lyrics.He's a little too honest and off the wall to be a commercial successbut he's a lot of fun.I've been buying up his availabe CDS and I like them all.This may be my favorite but I just got it and need to listen a little more.
4,Easy Dovetails for a Good Price,"I bought this dovetail jig over a year ago with the intention of teaching myself to create through dovetails. I would work with it once in a while when I had extra scraps of wood. The instructions weren't that clear and I never felt totally comfortable with it. However, today I took a class at my local Woodcraft store featuring door and drawer construction. For the drawers we used the Porter Cable 4212. With in-person instruction the jig was easy to use and create through dovetails. I should have no problems doing them on my own at home now."
2,Not impressed - Does not live up to the other golwing reviews,"It's o.k. but the instructions need a lot of help. The pictures are good photos but with they way it is all assembled it's all very hard to follow. I don't know who is developing manuals these days but this one is not for the guy that's new to dovetails. If this is a first time jig for you get a KELLER JIG, the video shows how simple this can be done."
3,Porter cable dovetail router,The Porter Cable Dovetail router jig is extremely well made and appears rather easy to use once you learn how to use it. There are written instruction but I learn best either by hands-on or via seeing a CD showing its usage and setup. I found no CD available anywhere and while I have had the unit for a month have yet to learn to use it. I would hope Porter-Cable would make an instructional CD available.
4,Good and interesting film,"This film is a perfect example of Mexican American Postmodern Films. . . it has everything double-codings and contradictions, hybridity, ironic relationship towards history, oppositional stance, and incoherent narrative! I loved this film because of the story line . . . I loved the heavy metal rocker and the brainy Chicana student. Also, the location of this film was great . . . San Antonio, TX . . . what a beautiful city. Overall I really liked it and I would recommend it to all."
4,Elaborates on Truth,"Colson takes a topic that has been discussed by Christians ever since the disciples questioned Jesus about it when He was in Galilee with them, i.e., the role of God's kingdom and that of man's. Colson contends that the kingdom of God is within a person. It is not an external means of control exercised by political power. In the Epilogue he cites Winston Churchill's last words, ""there is no hope."" But Colson counters that statement by explaining that spiritual things are not based on the circumstances of this present world.On the other side of the coin, however, Colson presents specific examples throughout history where Christian have actively been involved in politics and government because of their belief in the eternal, unseen kingdom of God within. Having an awareness of things eternal, while contributing in this life is the balance he is seeking to describe."
4,A great book for those just beyond beginner level,"Getting back into chess after many years' absence, and having never gone very far, I looked for a few books that would help me. This book, because of its originality, stood out. Chernev, as the description above says, analyzes a number of games, move by move. While this type of presentation is not for everyone, if you have an analytical mind, and are itching to know why every move in certain games are played, this is for you."
5,I'll Be Thinking of You,The CD is very uplifting. I borrowed it from a coworker. I start my work day off by popping this CD into my computer. It makes me feel really good.My coworker borrowed the CD back to make a copy for himself.I've recommended this CD to many of my coworkers and friends.
4,Works just fine: good value,It's good quality and does what it's supposed to do without any drama. I might buy another for my other car.
2,Fell off my windshield twice,"When its hot this may fall off the windshield. Don't leave your GPS attached when your not in the care. Pro, you can put the GPS where you want on your windshield and makes the GPS easier to use"
1,Won't stick,"Not sure what I am doing wrong, but I followed the directions and the suction cup won't stay stuck to my windshield. Would appreciate any advice regarding this aspect of this product."
5,Great Product!,This is an excellent product and it works well with my Garmin Nuvi. I agree with others who state that it is much better than the mount that comes with the Nuvi. The original mount did not work but about 5 times and was flimsy and unreliable. I have had excellent results with this mount and it is very sturdy. I can even adjust the Nuvi after I have it mounted and the mount stays put! I am very pleased!
3,Not as good as the ratings would suggest,"I bought this item based on the rave reviews as my OEM Garmin mount was no longer staying on due to a torn rubber suction cup. This mount is barely better than the faulty one I replaced it with. First and foremost, the ball is a bit too small and therefore does not keep a good ""grip"" and allows the Garmin to move when trying to enter data into it. Next, it does fall off of the window at times, which is not much better than the damaged OEM mount I replaced with it. Lastly the wheel which you use to set the angle of the extension (with the ball at the end) comes loose and you have to tighten it up every so often. Summary - It is OK vs. all the rants about how great it is."
3,"Great, but be careful","I was very happy with this item. Right away I could tell it was MUCH better than the original mount that came with my Garmin. It worked like a charm. Then on the 3rd day I had it, I went to turn the knob on the side to adjust the arm and the knob broke apart in my hand. Luckily the arm was tightened, so it is not that big of a deal otherwise I would have asked for a replacement."
2,Small Ball-Size,"Let me start off by saying that I already have an Arkon mount for my cell phone, that still holds strong on my windshield at the most extreme temperatures. So when I wanted to replace my OEM mount for Garmin 205W, I didn't had to think twice to get another one from the Arkon family. But honestly, this one was a let down. As some other reviewers had suggested, the ball size on this product is a bit too small to fit into my OEM holder that goes around my Garmin 205W. As a result of this, whenever I want to enter the coordinates or set the destination on my Garmin 205W, it gives me a hard time as the GPS unit keeps rotating around the small ball of the Arkon holder. I actually had bought three of these and don't know what to do with the rest of them."
5,Better than expected,I bought this to replace the mount of my nuvi gps. It is better than the original mount and I love it.
5,Simply Delicious,"Lush, erotic, soulful and beautiful are just a few of the words I can think of to describe this CD. Every song on this disc deserves 5+++ stars. From the energetic opener Hold My Peace to the lullabyish closing songs Baby God and Sweet Dreams 4 U IC..I have owned this CD since 96 and I still listen to it weekly. Jhelisa writes songs from her soul and it is so apparent when one listens to this scrumptious CD. I am eagerly anticipating her next release."
2,Didn't last,The outside sensor failed within a couple of months. Need sharp nails to move switch which operates very hard
5,Trusted Quality Service,"In my experience this is a trusted source to purchase items through Amazon.com. The CD was new and packaged, just as promised, in perfect condition. The shipment was very quick and there were absolutely no problems during my purchase or afterwards."
1,Do not purchase if you want quality,Christmas 2009: 7 year old daughter's gift from Santa - CD player does not work at all. Plastic buttons feel flimsy to the touch. Returned to Amazon for refund. Lesson for Santa: Try out gift before delivery.
3,Sound quality poor recording from CD to tape,"This Cd/tape player/radio has a good sound with the radio and playing commercial CDs and tapes but taping from a CD to the tape deck and then playing the tape back, the sound was distorted. Otherwise, this product is adequate for the money. I played the tape I made from the CD on another tape player and it sounded fine. Not sure what the problem is with playing the tape on the recorder it was made on. Operating the device is fairly simple. It does not have a port for a microphone."
3,Just for the kiddies.....,"This is a movie just for the kiddies. No crude humor (like in ""Munchie""), not that much profanity, and no good jokes. The kiddies will have a kick out of this one. If you loved the orginal ""Munchie"" this is not for you, instead the film-makers tried to copyoff a good movie making it kiddy."
4,Management skills from the NLP viewpoint,"Having read the previous two reviews, I find the first, the positive one, the most helpful. It has been a while since I read this book, but I kept it. I think it is clear and helpful. The fact that familarity with NLP would help understand more of what is going on, the author has made the information and argument quite clear. It is helpful to anyone working with people, especially if they are somewhat literate in the NLP technology. I do not think the book is in any way obtuse, but not all would enjoy this style, as is evident by the second review."
3,"A bit light, but gets the job done","A true Picasso...It looks great from far away, but once you get close, you can tell it's all plastic and cheaply made.We live in a windy area and due to the fact that it was so light, we had to relocate the bird bath to our deck, and tie it to the fence....I was really hoping we could put it in our front yard, but we couldn't. For the price, I was expecting it to be a bit sturdier."
4,Good Book,This book was a good book. I wish it was a tiny bit better. I think it was a tiny bit weird and the story is confusing. It is sad in the end.
4,Wife likes it,"I got the CD for my wife and if she's happy, then she leaves me alone, which satifies me. She's happy."
4,what's in a name,"Childe repudiated this book. As this edition indicates, it was a study of Indo-European origins, linguistic, archaeological, and...physiological. Although C. stated that culture and language did not necessarily coincide, he sought anthropological as well as other proof. P. 164 indicates that he was aware of racist arguments.skull measurements are out of fashion, and much has been discovered, but this book remains worth reading as a model of lucid argumentation on the basis of available data. It is a pleasure to see his mind at work. C. was the most energetic reader of archaeological reports of his era. He could both take into account a wealth of data and engage in synthesis."
3,Not the best so far...,"There are too many characters, and it's hard to tell them apart. Lots of incidents, but this time they don't add up to much at the end. At least this time it's nice to see January among a crowd that accepts him as a fellow artist, and treats him (at times) as a near equal. Full of interesting period atmosphere."
5,LET'S GO FISHING,"Everyone needs a vacation every now and again. Nameless is no exception as he escapes from the memory of his ex-partner's suicide and goes off to a mountain resort for rejuvination. Peace, quiet and solitude is just what he needs!Revenge, payback and hatred is what another vactioner desires as he plots the demise of all those who made him suffer when imprisoned. He too, desires the solitude needed to hatch his murderous plot. When he and Nameless encounter one another an explosive adventure begins leading both into mayhem.Pronzini takes us into the mind of a mad man whose psychosis keeps Nameless on the edge. Allow yourself to be intrigued and put on the edge by another exciting thriller in the Nameless series. Let's go fishing with Nameless."
5,First rate drama,"This has everything you could ask from a film; excellent performances with characters you really end up caring for, an interesting plot and a background that really illustrates the feel of a time and a place. It's a flawless movie really, and it should be seen."
4,Interesting Detective Story,"Even though this is an interesting detective story, I wish it contained more forensic detail. Great acting. Supposed to be based on a true story, but I'm sure there is considerable poetic license here. If you are into mysteries and detective stories, I'd strongly recommend this one!"
4,Tearjerker,I saw this a couple years ago and now have the DVD. Both times I have seen it brings me to tears. Great acting. One time where he is told the FBI uses him as an example and another time I forget now. I can really relate to final vindication scenes.
4,Good and gruesome,"Citizen X is a good and gruesome serial-killer detective movie that has the added charm of being set in the Soviet Union. The case with an increasingly-large body count only has one detective (Stephen Rea) actively doing any detective work, and he is initially hampered by the soviet beaurocracy, led by Donald Sutherland, who eventually comes around near the end. After a dozen years, the killer is apprehended and finally encouraged to confess (with understated persuasion) by psychologist Max Von Sydow.A bit graphic with the dead bodies and language, this is a well-acted and interesting movie.Not many extras - English or Spanish language; English, French or Spanish subtitles; and text-based cast/crew info."
2,Bad As Boots,These are awesome! I wore them with my police officer uniform. They run small and are very narrow! They get sweaty and hot. They look AWESOME. If you want to forget all about your problems buy a pair of really AWESOME shoes and you will forget all about your other problems because you will be to busy trying to walk like a model with feet that feel like a thorn bush! Great Fun Though!
2,A poor adaptation,"This movie was a pale imitation of the original. There were numerous unexplained plot holes, and a severe lack of action. Oddly enough the lack of extreme violence was also disappointing, Fist of the North Star was rather know for its violence, so not having it seems like a form of betrayal."
4,Good Clean Rock,"I bought this CD for my daughter. Although it really wasn't for me, I have to say that it's pretty good.The only song that I had ever heard before it 'We Live'. It is a very catchy tune with great lyrics.There are some other songs that I really enjoyed also. 'Beauty From Pain', 'Anthem', and 'Pure' are some of the better songs on the album.The music is really geared for teenagers and young adults. It is especially appealing for young girls. This is good, clean rock with a positive message. A couple of the issues that are addressed in their songs are bad relationships and eating disorders. There is a subtle Christian message in some of the songs also.If you want to find a good CD to give a teenage girl, this is a good pick. It is one that the parents may just enjoy a bit also."
3,"Has some good moments, but where is the rest of the CD!!?","These days, any CD under 40 minutes should be ashamed of itself! Enough said!But, there are still some tracks worth the price - the radio favorites, PURE and WE LIVE are probably the album highlights. While STORIES (apparently not originally from this album) fills in nicely as well.But, the length of this album just concerns me. Following two great albums, SC put out a ""RE-MIX"" album and then this one that barely clears 35 minutes. Makes me wonder if they are running out of steam! I hope not, because I have enjoyed the ride so far!"
4,Good for reggae dub effects too,"To those of you interested in reproducing old reggae dub effects: For the money, this digital pedal works wonders in your mixing board set up in an fx loop. The spring reverb here is very realistic, and the hall setting will make drums crash and explode very much like that early, very heavy King Tubby stuff. If you are seeking the shotgun snare drum, the ""whip of jah,"" or ""bag o' wire"" effects, and can't afford the old analog equipment, this is a great alternative."
1,Who cares?,"I am not sure who is worse the idiot writing the book or the people who actually enjoy this trash. We get it: Tucker Max acts like an 18 year old and is proud of himself. He doesn't care what anyone thinks about his behavior, except when it will earn him a dollar.Anyone buying this book knowing what it is about is a lunatic."
2,Unremarkable.,"Update 8/22/08: I guess this review was edited by someone other than me and parts of my prior review were omitted. Pretty pathetic -- probably one of Tucker's no-lives who completely define themselves through a closet homosexual desperate for attention. Well, good job, you've edited another post to try to artificially prop up Tucker's poor writing and soon to be sad attempt at a movie.The book is saturated with typographical, spelling, and formatting errors--almost to the point that it interferes with the syntax and sentence/paragraph flow in some stories (especially the new ones).Don't get me wrong, I was a big fan of Tucker Max when he first started writing his stories, but the book is just too much--it reads like a 300 page broken record covered in copy errors--a bad poor first effort for the print medium, notwithstanding its position on the New York Times Best Seller list [...]."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!!!,"Why anyone goes out of their way to buy, read and thus facilitate this self-professed asshole's egomaniacal dross is beyond me. Furthermore, the entirety of this filth smacks of desperation. Why not be content in your self-assurance that you have lived every man's dream? Well, that's because you, Mr. Max, are a sad caricature of masculine insecurity, who preys on the illiterate somnolence of the quasi-reading public. A reliable source within the industry also tells me that this guy resorts to the sad and awkward practice of removing his shirt in front of women. If that's your idea of an engaging narrator, well, let's be honest here, you probably don't read anyway. For those that do, please don't give this hack a cent of your money or a shred of your time. I think even the most immoral, deviant sectors of society would be corupted by reading this trash. I also won't be surprised if certain ""indiscretions"" in fact-checking or truth-telling emerged regarding this douche-moir."
3,Offensive (to some) yet entertaining,"Max can be egoistic at times, certain recounts of stories can be over-embellished and repetitive. Nonetheless, overall a funny and entertaining book. Would not recommend to girls as some might find it offensive and disrespectful. However, it is still a funny read."
5,Outstanding,"Depending on your personality!! You might find yourself totally hating this book; however, as for me this was the book that took me to a whole new level of laughter. This book is a spitting image of what college was like for me and how it should have been for others. Cruel, full of short stories, and I couldn't put the book down. I would defiantly recommend this book for anyone with a dry sense of humor. If so I guarantee you will laugh from beginning to end!"
5,"Hide Your Women, Children, And 30 Packs",I got alcohol poisoning and 3 STD's just from reading this book.And I mean that as a compliment.
1,insecurity at its finest,"As another reviewer stated: crude; yes, stupid; yes, funny; NO, I have to totally agree, this book is far from funny, its obnoxious at times, and tedious to read. Tucker Max boasts about getting laid and making fun of women which is all the book is really about.Dont expect the character to shift his mindset or ever grow up; there is no moral story. Maybe I'm being ridiculous for wanting one out of tucker but it would have made the story more interesting to see this immature insecure guy realize his faults then grow up, but unfortunately that didnt happen. If youre into an insecure guy getting drunk and laid maybe this book is for you, but I didnt find anything about it funny and had to force myself to finish the book which was really a waste of time.I threw it out afterwards."
1,Forget Max Tucker - I feel like a Max Sucker after spending money on this drivel.,"To avoid redundancy from many of the previous reviewers, I'll simply say ""What a disappointment!""While my friends and I could easily go beer for beer and story for story with Mr. Tucker, I can't help but think we would want to pound the snot out of this guy if he hung with us.Save the money."
1,extreme bro warning,tucker max is funny in the way farts are. yea its funny but then you smell it. this bro is everything that is wrong with the world today. after the first chapter i was livid i spent my money on this. i couldve just spent this night with my adolecent high school age siblings and semi retarted boys and found the same comedic and life value. slightly makes me regret getting a real job and not writing about every maningless demeaning and pointless story i have. thank you tucker max for glorifing a meaningless existance.
1,"- 5 Stars, Please.","Tucker Max shamelessly promotes drunk driving. The author does not deserve a penny more in profit for bragging about his dysfunction and promoting drunk driving. Perhaps --- If this Tucker Max is a real person---and these stories are real---he'll mature, hopefully someday, and use his love for writing and write a paperback about his extended stay in alcohol and sexual rehab for redemption.Tucker is all about numbing himself from reality through countless wasted sexual encounters, and I don't know how many times he referred to woman as ""fat"" or ""fatty's."" I do wonder if all the stories are entirely true. Tucker Max is like the bully on the playground who craves attention---negative attention. Don't buy this paperback, but if you're curious, borrow from the library. I was disgusted by page end. SAVE YOUR MONEY."
3,Not imressed,"I read this book and was very excited at the beginning. Even though I was entertained, I think I would have enjoyed this alot more before I got married and had kids. Good book and i see why he is so successful in writing, but it just wasn't for me."
2,Fun for a Young Men's Account,"Made me laugh, but had some unblieveables in it too.Fun to read wondering what was next..Not a girls book though."
1,I want my money back,"I couldn't get past page 50, and I'm no quitter. I couldn't even stick with it figuring it HAD to get better. This guy is anegotistical little twit and if this book was actually on the NY Times bestseller list I fear for the future. Stories aboutvomiting, one nighters and drunken brawls.....wow. Lame. If Max has any brains, why doesn't he use them to go out and dosomething decent instead of bragging about his awful behavior. What was the guy who OK'ed this for publication thinking. I guessif people think they can make a buck they'll do anything. Pathetic. Note to Max: stop while you're ahead. If you dont' havea serious case of something yet, you will. Stay out of my neighborhood."
2,fun at first..,The book is fun at first but after 2 or 3 experiences it gets boring to read about another drunken rave and another sexual encounter. It's just like when you are in a bar with friends living it up. Fun when you experience it boring for others who haven't been there to hear about it more than once.All in all a dissapointing read and I am sorry I spent money on it.
3,Read the first couple stories then don't bother,"I agree with the previous post by D. Muron. The first story had me laughing and crying. The second and third stories had me giggling and laughing as well. Then I lost interest in the frat-like stories. It almost became sad and pathetic. I didn't finish the book. I'm always up for a good laugh, and I think this book is definitely a ""rental"" aka read a few stories and then get rid of it."
4,Tucker Max,"Hilarious book. Great read - if you're not easily offended. He is likely full of crap, but funny nonetheless. He is witty, apologetic at times, rude, crass, and silly. Just what I love to read. Quite informative into the world of a pig. hahahahahaha!!!"
1,Dont Waste Your Time/Money,"I have read some of Tuckers stories,they are available online. Recently, I borrowed this book, only to find out it is more of the same! Its basically the same drunken,wild,smart-ass frat-boy antics,embellished and put in print.His ability to write is mediocre at best,and the ""wild and crazy"" stories grow tedious.If you really love the stories on his site,and(ideally)have a below average IQ,then this book is right up your alley.I cant believe this made the NY Times bestseller list(albeit #30,or so),and that its getting such great reviews here. It must be all the brownnosing groupies from the Tucker Max messageboard.Some 'well read' fans have compared him to Hunter S Thompson, or even more laughably, Charles Bukowski. Its hard to believe they were able to put down the crackpipe long enough to finish Tuckers book, much less read a novel by Bukowski.Never underestimate the stupidity of people.Spend your cash on something worthwhile."
1,Rats,"I was really hoping for a good read. Just a rich, spoiled brat talking about how he and his bros like to drink, poop and chase equally shallow women.Gee, I hope Tucker's mommy is proud of him."
5,New Different Tucker Max?,"I've read both of Tucker Max books and there's no denying his comedic genius. However, there is a new comer who has found a way to incorporate all that we like in the Tucker Max's stories, with a common theme of living life like everyday could be your last. It's also nice that this book focuses on a group of friends rather than just one solo character. Check it out, it's free anyway. http://www.ripashot.com"
5,HILARIOUS and honest,"This book is not for the easily offended...which is half of what makes it a great book. Tucker Max speaks in this book the way he would in real life. As you read this book, you feel as though you're sitting across from him listening to his wild stories. There's not much to say...you just have to read it. If you have a light heart and a broad sense of humor, you'll enjoy this book."
2,Occasional moments of enjoyment,"A friend recommended this to me and, as I'm no stranger to crude humor, I picked it up. Unfortunately, this book seems more a study in misanthropy than a study in humor. I did laugh from time to time, but not nearly as much as I'd hoped. The whole book ended up coming across as dark and sort of depressing to me."
3,Short and Honest,"This book is a great read. It is written very well. For anyone trying to get back into reading and want to start out with something fun and light hearted, this is for you. The only reason why I say don't buy this book is because 90% of the stories in it are on the authors website - TuckerMax.com Unless you do not have access to internet, which you probably do since your on Amazon.com, there is no reason to buy this book. I do encourage you to by future releases from Tucker Max. I believe he has two books coming out simultaneously in 2012. He stories are very funny and entertaining."
1,I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell,IF I COULD GIVE THIS A BIG FAT ZERO I WOULD BUT I WAS STUCK GIVING IT 1 STAR. THE BOOK AND THE MOVIE IS RUDE AND CRUDE. TRULY A WASTE OF ONES TIME.
4,good old boy humor,"Very funny book. Being female and over 40, I was many of the girls (at one time or another in my lifetime so far) that T. Max describes in his book. Even so, it is sometimes hard to read thru the good ol' boy humor. I laughed in spite of it all and that makes me glad I bought this book. Certainly geared towards the male funny bone and women who like a good male bone too :)"
1,Anyone who went to my college or any other college could write this book,"I bought this book expecting some drunk stories written with some wit and style, but all I got was a book that I could've written myself about our college stories. As soon as I got the end of the first few stories and they ALL ended with some version of ""Yeah, that night was pretty f***ing ridiculous"" I had to stop. I can tell stories better than that, and guess what, my friends and I got drunk in college a lot too."
1,Offensive,"I bought this book based on a friends recommendation. Although I think it could have been funny it was not. Too many times the jokes come at the expense of someone elses feelings. Although Tucker tries to write off the way he treated people and his attitude at the time these stories took place as him just being young and immature, this doesnt wash with me. Being young does not give anyone the right to be a complete ass. This book is written by a rich guys kid who thought the world revolved around him and no one else mattered on any level. This kid was a punk and I am glad that he is the exception to the rule. I was no angel when I was at his age, but I was never as mean spirited or self centered as this jerk. His parents i am sure are very proud."
4,Hillarious!,"A very crude, but funny read. Not for the faint of heart or the easily disgusted. Reads very quickly."
2,Boring after 1st story,"Anyone that has been to college will have stories on the same level. Dont waste your money on this.I didnt even bother finishing the book, since I realized it had no point."
2,Frat lit: Here's the entire book:,"Tucker Max is a spoiled rich kid. He has a lot of sex and drinks a lot. He doesn't respect women. That said, the writing is punchy, and I laughed out loud two or three times. Ultimately boring and a chore to finish. Life's too short to waste the time reading this."
2,Did not Enjoy this book,"In the final analysis this book wasn't funny or interesting. Kind of a waste of time. The stories are either highly exaggerated or outright fabrications. Frankly, I've heard most of them before so there's nothing new here and nothing memorable in the re-telling."
5,"Funny, never thought I would pick a book up, but ill keep picking this one up",This is by far the funniest book I have ever read in my life and the people who have read it when i told them about it agreed. Number 1 book to read in your lifetime!!!!!!
1,Overated and tedious,"Tucker Max is a marketing genius. His only product is himself, or the persona he has created. There are just so many drunken adventures worth reading about...and many of his are not worth the time. I did not expect to love the book, but I did think that it would be more creative and amusing. I found his antics often predictable, sometimes funny, but often boring."
2,gross,teenage boy who is disgusting with no morals or class really really bad. Do not recommend this book. DON'T READ
1,Energy Level didn't Change,I did not feel any increase in energy using this product. Still trying to find the ephedra products that worked for me.
5,A Wish Come True*,"Canon's 10x30 IS Binoculars are magnificent for viewing even the tiniest bird far away and up a tree! With the IS technology you will not loose sight of your prey as it swoops and dips in flight. It is wonderful to be able to see details you never knew existed, right in front of you.My only Christmas wish was for a pair of these binoculars and I have enjoyed them nearly every day since. Try some before you buy any other kind and surprise yourself too."
3,cool but not that great,"i tried these in a store the other day. they are cool, but not worth the money. the image stabilization wile it does make a shakey image stable, its no where near as stable as the people in the above comments claim. there is a noticeable improvement, but not $600 worth of improvement. id wait awhile and see what the next generation of this technology has to offer before comminting to purchase."
2,'Garbage bags' is accurate,"This is a premium-brand bag with the quality of a store brand. I've used six of these bags and torn three, all just below the blue straps. They're thinner than past Hefty bags. If you actually intend to fill the bag, your refuse is heavy or sharp, or your can is tight, buy something else. The Ultra Flex line is a major improvement, but no better than these bags were in the past."
3,"It's okay, nice for the size/weight","I wasn't blown away by the optics of this brand of binoculars, but they are light and comfortable. I did not want a heavy, bulky item, so I think the sacrifice in optics is worth the added comfort."
4,Jesus' Lost Years,"Good investigative report - - it does help to fill in some blank spaces. Some of the responses by religious authorities in the places (locations) to Perry's questions may be questionable to some (maybe many), but the work was worth considering."
4,Discount Coupons,"There seemed to be some disagreement here about whether this set still comes with discount coupons for the exams anymore. I just wanted to say I just bought the set (end of March) and mine does have the coupons. They're only good until June 30, 2004, but they're in there. Other than that, the set looks good, I hope to start going through it tonight. (NOTE: the Visual Studio 60 day trial comes on DVD, so if you don't have a DVD ROM and want to use the trial, you're out of luck!)"
4,Don't expect everything but good certification prep books,I have QUE books for actual hands-on studying at home. But I wanted books for a quick on-the-go studying. I'm satisfied with the sets for the following reasons:1) each book is light enough for me to carry in my backpack everyday.2) Content may not be in-depth but is decent enough.3) Exam questions are much better than QUE books. This is arguable However I just passed 70-315 and I can tell you that many of the questions were awefully familar thanks to the practice questions that came with the set.No discount code in my set but I bought the voucher from online companies that offers 10+ % discount.
3,"Good guide to exams, but experience is needed","Having worked with .NET for almost two years the first three books (305/315, 306/316, 320) where a good guide as to what topics might be covered in the exam. I would certainly recommend them.The last book for 70-300 was misleading. The sample questions were not even close to the format or question type offered in the exam. The exam covered material not covered in the book where experience really is a must or at least familiarity with MS Products like BizTalk and Host Integration Server. Out of the set, this is the only book I would really recommend a person read for background purposes only and find something else to prepare them for the test. The book is not without merit though as it is a good intro to MSF."
4,Love the chocolate....been using it for over 15 years!,"Excellent meal supplement and the chocolate is so delicious with skim milk that I have it as a treat rather than a meal sometimes. Just throw it in the blender and you're off. This is by far my favorite shake supplement. I find the taste complaints here confusing as I have used 5 of the flavors and found them all to be delicious! Chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, peanut butter and cookies & cream...YUM!"
1,Wow Gross,"So i love love love most protein drinks. This one, however, was awful. I was using it as a breakfast drink meal replacement deal and while yes i stayed full for a few hours.. it was all i could do to choke it down.Disgusting! And it doesn't blend well so i was literally gagging over the chunks in it.Terrible for taste but did okay in it's other needs i suppose. I wouldn't recommend unless you have no tastes buds and/or an iron stomach!"
5,Great Meal replacement,I use this to replace dinner when I am counting calories ..... it keeps me from desperately attacking the refrigerator at 10pm. It works great with skim milk or water or whatever other type of liquid you enjoy. Chocolate or Vanilla are my favorites
4,Stranger never recieved the recognition they deseved.,"I saw Stranger in concert (in Daytona) several years ago. They had a great show and their music was crisp, powerful, and in your face rock and roll. The tape I purchased at the show (No Rules), is one of the best I own- out of 350 of other artists. This one sounds just as excelent as the last. I wish they would re-release both CDs. This band never recieved the recognition and marketing talent they deserve."
4,good,I ordered this item for my mother. She was very happy with the results/price. Item tastes good and it is good for you
2,Old and dated,Got this set of DVDs as seemed to be good value. Viewed the France DVD and was disappointed. Rudy Maxa is superficial in his comments and the travelogue is short and dated (made in 2002). Rick Steves is streets ahead
3,Mixed Emotions,"Okay, Karrine suffered a painful childhood as do many others and I felt the appropriate amount of sorrow for the pain inflicted upon her. However, her numerous sexual romps during her adult life cannot be blamed on her childhood. And if her childhood was so awful, why didn't she make sure that her own child was loved and nurtured by his mother.By the end of the book, I had little sympathy for the author. Although she is aware that she has been explotied, nothing she said indicated that she planned on making any serious life changes."
3,"Does anyone know who ""Papa"" is?","The book is interesting but if she was still messing around with Usher in 2004, how did she learn her lesson and all of a sudden see the light to write this book?I am not knocking her for it, they used her for what they needed and now she is using them in return...u gotta make that money right?I don't get how she mentioned every little detail with everyone else, but she won't mention ""Papa"".Who was big in hip hop during her time and had his videos all over BET? He is a lot older too. There are not too many people who make a huge impact on hip hop like she mentioned in the book.Anybody know??"
3,Lacking something,"Karrine's story was gripping, but there was emotion missing. I felt like she was just sitting back, giving a list of things that happened and not really grasping the effects of them. Regardless, I think she is a strong woman and I admire her willingness to say, ""ENOUGH!"" and get her stuff together."
3,Tell me your story,I am alittle star struck with all of the names she named. I am glad she got some of her demons off her chest with this book. It was well writtened and perfectly timed. I enjoyed the book so much I reread it immedeately after I finished it. I am a fan of her now....
5,Great Read,I think this book is good for girls who want to enter the entertainement industry as video models/vixens. It gives them a glimpse of what the industry can be like from someonoe who has been there.
2,"Don't Mean to be rude, but...","I had an somewhat of an idea of the storyline and do not want to pass judgement. This woman made Jenna Jameson look like a choir girl! First of all, it seemed more of a tell-all about the guys (and girls) that she slept with and second of all, she did not update on how she has improved her life. It seems to me that writing a tell all might have been the way to go to some quick dough. Yes, I know she was abused and had bad relationships and etc, etc, but for goodness sake, what is the lesson learned here? If a young girl reads this book, she may be fascinated instead of educated. In regards to Jenna Jameson, at least she has cleaned up her act, settled down and gotten married, and now is CEO of her own company even though she is still in the porn industry. No disrespect, but this book was more of celebrity trash than a ""cautionary tale""."
2,"Entertaining, but lacking substance","Although the events of the book are so interesting, that I had a hard time putting it down...there is no positive message. Karrine claims that the book was written to empower young women who use sex as a replacement for self-esteem, but I had a hard time finding this moral in the book. After everything she went through, she still sleeps with celebrities and craves the party scene. Where was the growth and lessons learned?If you're looking for an entertaining and quick read, this is the book. If you're looking for substance or something to introduce to our young, vulnerable women...stick with maya angelous, jill scott, and alicia keys. She is no romodel."
3,Video Vixen,"This was an interesting tale. One can get caught up on how ""gossipy"" this book can be. It was like reality TV. A real page turner."
1,Not worth your time!,"You can tell its a bunch of lies from the minute she says she ""starred"" in that movie and all those music videos. If you see the movie and music videos you have to search her out. Don't buy it!"
2,It's nothing special. Just something to read to kill time,Her writing is not great but her life story is something to read. But as a writer she is awful. A fifth grader could have wrote this and did a better job that she did.
2,Crazy,"Ms.Steffans was by her admission high and drunk most of the time.That explains why she felt that any of these hip hop stars cared anything about her.She was ""easy"" and the artistes used her.Let this be a lesson to any woman who thinks that any of these artistes care anything about anyone other than themselves.Young women please , please , please, get an education .Don't think you are going to have it easy by being married to or being the mistress of any of these types of men."
3,Sharon's review of a Video Vixen,The book was okay. I thought she was very inconsistent in her story telling. I was shocked that she continued to behave like a whore. Because that's what she really is. And the partying and drugs...clearly most of the entertainment world is doing it.Karine Steffans has some major issues that she needs to work out with herself and God.
3,confessions of a video vixen,"The hype surrounding the book overshadowed the content of the material in the book. With a book of this nature, I expected more inside details of her interactions with different celebrities and more about the ""secrects"" she knew. I also expected more details about her sexual encounters and less about the father of her child. She could have written a separate book about her life with him and just had the details of the ""video vixen"" lifestyle in this particular book."
4,Karrine Steffans Sees The Light,"in that the whole industry exploits vulnerable women of color such as Karrine Steffans. I know some would say that they participated voluntarily but I hear stories such as Ms. Steffans regarding music industry's exploitation and abuse of women who starred in rap videos. The whole hip hop video scene has come under fire recently by all sectors of society for its sexual and violent content.Karrine Steffans is a beautiful multiracial woman of Puerto Rican, Black, and Danish ancestry who came from a broken, abusive home and have survived an abusive marriage. Thanks, Karrine for sharing your story with us."
1,"this is a pathetic story, written by a pathetic person","I guess I'm getting too old to see the value in stories like this. I can't identify with the hip hop generation. There is no real story here. It's more like a collection of incidents. The subject goes about recalling numerous sexual and drug filled relations with the rich, famous and infamous celebrities. This book was reccommended by a friend. From now on I'll ask that he not give me anymore recommendations."
3,Everyone in the industry has had this girl omg,"This book is a good tale of what young women should not be. I dont know why she would decide to write a book about all of the high profile men she has slept with especially since most of them were married. Shes been with everyone from fred durst to usher..shaq to diddy..She had a young son who she basically ditched with a nanny so that she could sleep around with these men. She expected all of these men to take care of her and when they didnt expected people to feel bad for her. This woman seems like nothing but a gold digger. The book is ok if you are into hip hop. Its basically tryst after tryst with a whole slew of rappers...irv gotti,ja rule,ice t,vin diesel,diddy,jay z,usher,ray j,shaq, and the list goes on."
3,C.R.E.A.K! Cash Rule Everything Around Karrine!,"I read this book 4 FREE in a bookstore. While I think that the book was written for pure monetary value and not emotional enlightment, it still was what it was purported to be a Thrilling, engaging if sometimes fictional book. Whoever is hoping that she's changed and thinking that this is a good guide to help little girls hoping to follow in THE VIXEN's footsteps might need their own minds examined. She is the same person she was at the beginning of the book to the end. I don't believe she loved any of the men but used them and it's ok because they used her too. Two wrongs don't make it right but it does make it even and MISS VIXEN got hers all the way too the bank! If you choose to read the book then read it for what it is and not for what you want or hope it to be. So while I think this shallow book was enjoyable it just goes to show that sometimes you can judge a book by its COVER!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Okay book,Could have been better could have been worse. I find it was a little rushed and lacked detail but her story is definitely expiring.
3,Video Vixen Review,I found this book a very easy read...I finished over 1/2 of the book the first day I got it. Karrina's life has been so exciting & thrilling & titillating & almost tragic @ the same time. This girl has got much game indeed!! I love that every man she came n2 contact w/helped her in some way...what a whirlwind life it has been 4 her...I hope things have settled down 4 Karrina....I especially loved the section about Vin Diesel...ooh...wee...just what I expected...lol...If u want a glimpse n2 the world of hip hop...I definitely recommend this book...Karrina takes u from the inside out...what a ride....
1,"Lord God, what an awful book","Bad. Really, really bad. I couldnt read a page without feeling totally repelled and disgusted by this bubble brained bimbo and the degrading, dehumanizing lifestyle for which she frantically whores herself.If only Amazon would give us a rating far far below ""1 star."" This book alone would be justification."
2,She's just a plain old ho,This book is just a boring diary of a woman with no brains and no self respect. Pointless.
4,A lovely read!,"It was a lovely book. I am 21 years old and could not have imagined having to go through these various trials and tribulations in life. Although God has a different path and plan for each and everyone of us, its a huge blessing to see women like Karrine overcome defeat. I am thankful that she wrote this book and shared her life because even though I have not experienced totally everything she spoke about somethings did give me ""aha"" moments. There were so many topics in this story that needed individual discussions and open healing forums it was amazing. It was life whether we heard from someone third hand about their friend going through it or we were living it ourselves. What a story!"
2,snooze fest!,"If you use books to fall asleep at night, this one will be perfect! You would think that with all of the sex she had and drugs that she took that she would be able to tell an interesting story, but she just glosses over the details and bores us with what she does want to tell us."
1,Trash is as trash does...,"This woman is truly delusional. She claims to have been ""used and reused"". Read your own words. YOU ARE THE USER! Is it a coinsidense that you moved onto the next c*o*c*k when a lot of these MANY, MANY men ran out of money. I feel ripped off by you too!"
2,Video Vixen,"almost entertaining lots of pieces of gossip, but a bit repitious, no real revelations. may be a decent read for a young person seeking the same level of response from men. glad she's still alive and able to make a book."
3,TRASHY BUT REDEEMABLE,"The story is okay, written in a flowing, entertaining manner, but is the age-old tale of a woman selling her body and soul for a chance at stardom and a shot at money and jewels. It would be likely boring to read but I would like Karrine to get her act together, grow-up, and take care of her son. He is watching her every move and there may well be another generation that belays hard work and study, and tries for the shallow life of fancy cars and expensive watches, and hip-hop music and gold chains. I sincerely hope she can escape the sordid life without AIDS and a life-threatening drug habit. After reading her book, I would hate to see a small piece in an entertainment magazine about an unidentified, unknown adult female found dead in an alley after being thrown out like garbage from a Mercedes limo. I trust that she will stay true to herself and her son."
1,A con artist,The only reason that she wrote this book was to get money out of the situation she put herself into. Now one forced themself on her and I don't feel sorrow for her at all. What she needs to do is get some help before she comes up with HIV or AIDS. I just heard that she's now a Porn Star. She needs God in her life.
1,This is a woman who,Feels like all successful men owe her money for being pretty and sex. All this book is about is who she had sex with. As far as learning these peoples character she only gives one or two sentences about what they said. Its not enough that you feel like you actually get the character of these people. It scares me that she mention magic johnson in her book. I wouldn't be suprised if this woman has checked into many clinics to be treated for stds! but she wouldn't tell the public if she had. Keep that in mind. In the book its as if she wants the people reading the book to envy her!!!
4,Animal abc's!,"A fabulous way to connect the ""A, b, c"" with actual words - especially for my animal crazy four year old boy. He loves seeing the animal & what they eat, & enjoys telling me that Alligator starts with A, etc. It is only North American carnivores, so there were a couple even I didn't know (English Mum!), so we both learnt those together!"
3,Great while it lasted,Worked great until the motor burned up. Replaced the motor just to have the new one do the same. Have yet to figure out what is causing it but it shouldn't me burning up motors with just 4 aa batteries.
2,"Beautiful voice, but not used to it's full exent","I have loved Tamia's sound since she first arrived on the music scene with Quincy Jones, but for some reason she's not living up to her potential. The QUALITY of the music just isn't there. The only 2 tracks that I really like are ""Love Me in a Special Way"" (re-make) and ""A Stranger in My House"". Some of the other songs, especially ""Long Distance Love"", just don't have the R&B flava! It's as if she is trying to get into the meaningless pop sound. Her voice is just too strong and beautiful for that. I hope that she what works for her soon, because this just isn't it."
2,Wasted Effort,"Tamia's first CD that really didn't get much airplay was on point. That was one of the best CD's I had in my collection at the time of it's release. I looked forward to her new project, however, I am greatly disappointed. I don't understand who is picking her material. There are maybe two songs on the CD that are worth listening too. Stranger in My House and Love Me In A Special Way. The rest is totally not up to parr. She has a wonderful voice, and I hope that she is able to collaborate with someone who can showcase her talent in the near future."
3,Not what I thought I'd get out of it....,"There IS a lot of information about how families are affected by divorce, but I sort of wish it had been divided into two different books, one written about parents and divorce, and one written towards children, and how it affects them. As it is, the book was too tedious to sit and read all the way through for me. I skimmed it, and ended up putting it in the good will pile. Could be useful to someone contemplating divorce...but if you were the child from a divorced family, well, for me it related info I could have told them myself, but I was hoping for something to help with the after effects of divorce, and I didn't feel there was anything there in that department. But that is just my one opinion, there did seem to be a lot of research done there, maybe others find it useful, I just didn't."
1,Made me very depressed,This book is written on a higher level (clinical studies). It depressed the heck out of me and made me feel extremely guilty for a divorce I initiated.The book does provide insight on children's responses over time to divorce.
4,Helps understand our current problems in the Middle East,"The book helps understand our current problems in the Middle East, in particular, our relation to Israel and the tensions and stresses between Israel, the Arab states and the United States.The brilliance of Henry Kissinger is revealed. The intelligence and savy of Nixon was a supprise."
4,"Good, but...",Let's not forget that there are actually mental health diagnoses that could possibly be non-diagnosed with the attitude that mental health is a conspiracy! Books like this scare me in that we might get so caught up in the rhetoric that we may not see the forest from the trees. I think it's a good book if you're able to put this information into perspective. It definitely needs to be counter-balanced with books such as The Truth.
4,One of the essentials for all hockey players and coaches,This book covers all of the basics very well. Essential reading material for any level of hockey player and coach. I have read it over and over again.
5,A must-have for potty training,"It's very important to clean up your puppy's messes with an enzyme cleaner so that the smell of urine is completely eradicated. Using various soaps may erase the smell sufficiently for the human nose, the dog's nose knows, and once your dog has established a spot, s/he will likely go there again. Nature's Miracle is the best product I've found for cleaning scents thoroughly enough to prevent my dog from returning to the scene of his crime. I like the spray bottle because I have hardwood floors, and you don't want to just pour liquid on the floor.Unfortunately for me, I have also found that it is extremely effective for other types of accidents, such as vomit. It's a great all-around cleaner."
2,stained my carpets reddish in color,Do not use on green carpeting - it turns them red. I used it on my other carpeting that's wheat in color and it was fine. But the odor of the product is not a pleasant smell.
5,Wonderful Product,My cat had a urine tract problem and the situation was getting out of hand - Odorwise!-. This product completely took the odor away. Buy this product. The cat's in good health now thank goodness.
5,The best of the world,"Perfect weight, materials, construction and size for any cymbals. This is the stand you are looking for the boom is a good diameter shaft that allows the cymbals comfortably placed where needed and wingloc is perfect, but you can not ask!"
5,Excellent Breakcore Collection,"I have long been a fan of Benn Jordan's music. Although I usually prefer his more ambiant songs, this album turned me onto the breakcore genre. Its an excellent collection of elegant music with some moving piano ballads, with an electronic blend that is truly fantastic. I believe that any electronica fan must pick up this album for their collection."
3,Read it out of curiousity.,"I received this book through my Diamond Rewards Card. It was not my intention to purchase the book, but after the real housewives of NJ flaunted the book left and right across the screen, I just had to get it. The book describes the life of a coniving individual. He screwed up too much at an early age and kicked himself in the butt for it. He was a snitch. He was not a cop at all. The book is not worth paying watever Amazon is charging for it. I would not have read it had I not received it for free. RHONJ Danielle is mentioned in the book, but not to the extent that I originally thought."
3,Cop Without A Badge,It was very interesting. It gives thougth to the Naked Truth which gives another persons view on things that happened.
2,I returned it -did not work well,"This is an ok product. I did not keep it. The touch screen did not work well enough. The price was good, but I think I will spend more to get the touch screen to work better."
5,GREAT GPS,"THE GPS IS EVERYTHING THEY SAID IT WAS, AND MUCH MORE. YOU WOULD BE FOOLISH TO LOOK AT ANOTHER SYSTEM. TRUST ME, THIS IS THE ONE AND YOUR LAST GPS YOU'LL EVERY NEED."
5,BEST VITAMINS EVER,"This is BY FAR the best multi vitamin choice out there. It can be a bit pricey, but its worth it. If you were to buy individual versions of everything in this jam packed multivitamin, you'd be easily spending WAY over the suggested retail price. So this is actually a good deal. super nutrition uses only the best ingredients and this one has the most antioxidents ever! I have been taking these vitamins for a year now and have yet to get sick. My energy has improved significantly as well."
1,Not a good deal,"You can find this cheaper at Rite Aid, even after they raised their prices $2.99/bar. These are $3.16/bar. I wish these were available as a subscription, but alas, no dark chocolate is."
3,New Formula. Double the Carbs!!,"This WAS a great product. It was great tasting and it had a crazy low amount of carbs compared to most anything else out there. For people who need to manage their carb intake, this was a real treat and there wasn't much else out there that compared. There is, I found on receiving my latest shipment, a new formula and the carb count has almost doubled from 8g per serving to 15g. This might not matter to most people but for some it can be a critical issue. I imagine it still tastes great with all the extra sugar and milk or whatever they've added but, unfortunately, this product no longer serves the niche it once did. Where it once was this great-tasting, low-carb indulgence, it's now just one of ten million sugary things out there."
2,Doesn't live up to its ratings.,I had high hopes for this book after reading the reviews. I kept waiting for the exciting ghost story to emerge but it never did. It was an easy read but just kept dragging on.
2,Mostly... nothing happens!,"A very-low key relating of a ""true"" haunting in PA shortly after WWII. Not much beyond some footsteps, doors opening and closing and a few items being transported, but at least it doesn't feel as if the writer is trying to sensationalize the family's experiences. Having done a little research after reading, sounds as if their conclusions, and at least some of their experiences, have no basis in fact -- SHOCK! That all being said, it's an okay read if you're looking for a low-key and not very scary book about a haunting."
1,Big disappointment!,"I'm a fan of several Christina Dodd's books but the Governess Series is just plain awful. The characters are so weak she doesn't even try to bring more of a challenge into these books. It definitely isn't funny whatsoever. All of the characters are annoying, especially the ""Matchmakers"" types. Just a huge disappointment."
1,Drinking for little kids,This book is full of stupid childish games. No one over the age of ten would ever play these games. You would get your ass kicked if you tried to play any of these games with your friends. I can't stress how stupid they are. Anyone who says this is a good book must not have ever drank a beer in their life or partied with anyone ever.
5,I love this book!,"I've been a homeschooling mom... After using Concerned Communication's A Reason For Writing since the beginning, we stumble on A Reason For Spelling this year. I was tired of ""boring"" spelling curriculumns, so figured we'd spend the extra $$$ and give this a try. Well, we ALL love it (we're using levels A, C and E for our 1st, 3rd and 5th graders). There is a lot of activities packed into these pages, and you can pretty much pick and choose how much of it you want to do. There are reproducibles in the teachers manuals of additional activities. I'm thinking of using it again next year with all the activities, and I should be able to turn it into our full Language Arts program. One word of warning, DON'T try to use this without the teachers manual, you will be LOST! I find the teacher's manual invaluable!"
2,Book improperly packaged,"What started out as a 'good' condition book was turned into a 'below average' one, by being packaged poorly by the seller. The problem is this, a thin plastic envelope twice as big as the book without padding was used.This had the effect on the book as if it was tumbled in a dryer in transit or another analogy of a hamster in a hamster ball rolling down stairs. The cover on the book was badly creased in three places,the spine of the book was cracked horizontally in the middle. The top corner was banged up.Finally 3/4 of the pages and the cover were so curled upon the lower right hand corner that when you set the book down on the table there is a 1"" gap between the book pages and the cover which would not close.I've received many books in the mail through Amazon. This was by far the worst."
1,No bang for the buck... look elsewhere!,"I'm disappointed again! Maxtor sells this product for 229.00 at Costco and one month after I bought it... (discounting madness strikes), and voila, 151.00!. The software that comes with this monster is worse than a dos batch program on a 286. Backup is not possible with this antiquated, barely functional excuse called ver 1.something or other. And this beauty REPLACES my cold, dead, frozen Maxtor external, 200gig... that one day after a year or so, (warantee over) decided to just roll over like my cat and never speak to me again. But... don't get me wrong, I simply live to continue throwing my hard earned worthless greenbuck... oh, you get the picture!"
1,"Maxtor drives are terrible, buyer BEWARE","I bought two of these drives, and they both broke and lost all my data in the 11th month of my owning them. Maxtor will not stand behind their drives for longer than a year beyond their manufacture. Pretty low confidence in their products, don't you think? When you buy a hard drive, you expect your data to be there for at least a year. Not these. I strongly reccommend that you do not buy these drives. They are awful products, and Maxtor as a company is extremely poor. You will be sorry if you buy them, I can guarantee it."
4,"Sleek, Comfortable, and Appealing","This fit perfectly once adjusted to my wrist size. The time stays accurate and doesn't require much attention to be winded. I would say it lasts about 1-2 days before it needs to be picked up again for the time to stay accurate.I feel that the images don't do the watch much justice as the chrome for the red and black are really nice and stand out. I feel that it can match with any attire, casual or business.I would have given it a 5 star if it wasn't for the spring on the timer, it would get stuck a little or give me a little too much resistance.Other than that, great product!"
5,Awesome - should be a movie like Lord of the Rings,I read the entire set of trilogies many years ago. This is my second time through. Wow great story worth reading. Someone should make a movie based on the books.
3,REALLY TWO AND A HALF STARS,"This is a very dissappointing book. Think Patterson spent way too much time with background in DARK LADY, maybe thinking ahead to series possibilites but the novel just fell flat. Hard to read and follow. Just didn't care for the principals involved. This murder mystery was just not exciting. Stella Marz is a pretty boring lead character. You can read much, much better Richard North Patterson books."
2,A Very Slow Moving Novel!,"Having just finished reading all of the fascinating and unbelievably good Phillip Margolin novels, I decided to try another author in that same genre. Well, Richard N. Patterson doesn't even come close to the quality of Margolin. I picked up Dark Lady because I saw it in soooo many stores that it drove me crazy, so I decided to read it. Good thing that I got it for half price because it is so boring. Too much of a history lesson thoroughout the first 30 pages. It is a typical drug/ murder novel with nothing that is very exciting. I don't care for the main character, Stella Marz, at all. This book is mainly a time-filler novel. Try the other Patterson, JAMES PATTERSON, that's a good novelist."
2,Murder and Corruption in a Tired Town,"Like other reviewers, I was also disappointed with Richard North Patterson's ""Dark Lady."" When you can't be truly interested in the characters it is difficult to become involved in their lives. It took about half of the book for it to really get moving and even then it was too late, because we already knew what was going to happen. I personally am getting very tired of authors deciding to 'kill the cat' or the dog for that matter. I don't enjoy predictable books and this one didn't even begin to stretch my mind. I surely hope RNP will take some more time, if that's what it takes, to get back to his former stature. I did enjoy ""No Safe Place"" unlike the critics, but this one should not have been published, at least under his real name."
1,Downhill story,I love the other Patterson books I've read so was very surprised with this one. Very slow start and then I kept finding myself having to go backwards to check if I'd missed something. I hate books that do this to me. Not sure what happened but this book definitely gets a thumbs down.
3,"Was disappointed, not a bad read, but not as good his others",I had trouble with the characters. I couldn't identify with them. It felt cold and distant overservations rather than an ongoing story.
3,Too dark,"I greatly enjoyed the mystery and the characterization of this novel. The twists and turns are amazing. However, I found the book to be too depressing for my taste as far as mysteries are concerned."
1,A huge disappointment,"This book was very difficult to get through. It didn't have any of the suspenseful pacing of his other terrific novels. The murders are unnecessarily grotesque and the characters are almost caricatures. Although the story line is admirably complex, that's not enough to save this book."
3,used to be one of the great products,"I love this soap. The smell alone is worth the price. I've used Lightfoot's pine for hand soap for years. Never had a complaint. Until this box. So far two of the bars of soap have come apart, like the top and bottom half of the bar were glued together with cheap glue. Maybe General Motors bought out Lightfoot's when I wasn't paying attention."
5,Book two continues to deliver!,"The second book in an epic tale does not disappoint. Leaving off where we left are collection of characters, we find ourselves projected into the future at the dawn of a new millennium where everyone is convinced the universe will end in a war between the Prophets. Sides have been taken and our characters are forced into choosing sides – even at gunpoint."
3,"An interesting book, fairly well-written.","The series as a whole may well wind up deserving a four-star rating, but as in the case of the first book, the individual parts only rate three. The characters are well-handled, the plot interesting if a bit depressing (hopefully that will be different by the end of book three) and the writing better than fair, if not the best I've seen in Star Trek books. But for one thing, this isn't a story, it's a story fragment, so it loses a bit of rating for that reason, and in any case, even if I didn't have that objection (at least the book is long enough to justify the story not being told all in one book) the story is good but not great. Worth the read, but not worth raving about."
3,SFRevu: Alt.Bleak.Future.Federation,"A lost Bajoran Orb of the Prophets promises to unlock another wormhole in the first two parts of this DS9 trilogy. Cardassians, Smugglers, and an Alternate Future (bleak). Oh My! In part one, lots of post occupation plotline, in book two, the Alt.Future Federation is in tatters, Picard is out to build the biggest starship ever seen, and Worf and Jadzia banter about their long life together. My first reaction to these books is; ""What? Again?"" My second is invariably; ""Gee...what happens next?"" Sigh...these books are as addictive as ever. (a third title yet to come...)"
2,Riddled with errors...,"This book has many errors, many of which I have forwarded to the publisher via email. Some of the questions are missing key information, but it appears in the solution. Sometimes the solution is just wrong. Some of the explanations are weak providing only the answer and perhaps a restatement of the question. While this book was helpful for a review, it was frustrating to have to double check information online at other sources to figure out who was wrong... me or the book. About 9 times out of 10, the book was wrong."
2,"Ok, Ya",This guy is pretty bad! The songs just hang there like bobbles stuck in Jello. They go nowhere. And his voice sounds like he's got a feather duster lodged in it. That wouldn't be so bad if he could only stay on key.I've seen this guy live. A waste of time. Please don't waste your money. I know I'm not.
4,Very helpfull.,It's been very helpfull to improve my english study. Now I'm looking for de CD that comes with this book. Do you happen to know where I can find it?
4,I like them,I like them. They have a clear and bright view that is as steady or steadier than 7 power non stabilized binoculars. The short neck strap and soft case coupled with the lack of front lens caps is a detriment. I am glad I got the 15 power rather than the 18 power because if you are in a hurry the field of view of the 15 power is plenty narrow and finding stuff fast is a bit of a problem especially if it is moving.
4,better finishes needed for an otherwise top product,"in brief, excellent image quality and the stabilization feature does make a huge difference.however, i can't understand why canon equipped these expensive/top of the line binos with such poor eyepiece covers and no objective covers?? the eye pieces are hooded by two covers, which fit very loosely and are not connected to each other nor to the binocular's body."
4,A delightful period piece,".Margery Allingham introduces her subtle regally-related sleuth to darkest pre-war East Anglia, with a plot key that revolves around balkan territorial rights....Stunningly relevant again today, and the 'love interest' is a remarkably strong character.Campion excels in misdirection with his seeming inanity, and brings the plot home with a splash."
4,Just what I thought it'd be,"Old games from when I was a kid. Boring but fun enough, easy to learn and play. Brings back memories from Atari 2600. Wish there was better instructions on how to play the game, mostly going from memory. Very convenient to be all in one little joypad."
1,Living Cheaply,"There is a lot of good information on how to live in Mexico if you can't make it financially in the US. Not really a book for those who are looking for more in living in Mexico than a country you can afford to live in.The author doesn't have to bad mouth America to make his point on why living in Mexico is a viable option.I wouldn't buy the book, unless you can't afford to."
3,"Good looks, smooth sounds, funny quirks","This unit is a nice peice of equipment. It produces very good sound for its size. It has a very clean, finished look and operates very well. The plexi/plastic cover moves smoothly up to allow access to the cds. It also has a full function remote control. The backlit display is a bit difficult to read at some angles. My biggest issue with this unit is the cords. I purchased this as a wall-mounted unit, as advertised, and hoped this would be considered during design. The speakers are wired, not cordless, and the unit has no place for batteries, so a cord must be used for power as well. I think this unit is more well suited for a shelf rather than wall-mounting."
5,A book for teens everywhere.,a book that teens can get into. If you like this book look for Home Of The Braves another book by David Klass.
4,Pretty Good,"I enjoyed this book! I chose to read it mainly because of the great reviews here on Amazon. I wasn't disappointed. The descriptions and the main character's personality truly enhanced the flow of the story and the enjoyment of it. There were times I was bored in the musical descriptions, so I skipped some pages, especially towards the end, however, I still liked it.Recommended if you enjoy colorful descriptions with humor."
2,Unfulfilled expectation,"I had awaited the release of this Canadian picture in the US with great expectations. I hoped that we would have the WW 1 equivalent of Saving Private Ryan.Instead we are left with two very short battle scenes. The first one is the opening scene, and is pretty well done. The second one is marred by the ridiculous crucifixion of David followed by his suicidal rescue by Michael. This paucity is all the more puzzling when one checks the making of the movie scenes, and realizes how much effort was invested in creating realistic scenarios.Home front Jingoism is well depicted and the love story is attractive. Had the climax (i.e. the last combat scene) been more believable, I would have given this movie 3 stars"
4,Something for everyone,"I happened to catch the last 10 minutes of this movie on cable one day and it caught my attention enough that I had to buy it. I have to say that it did not disappoint. It was somewhat predictable, but still a moving picture that was well-acted. Ladies, believe it or not, this ""war"" movie is also a ""chick-flick"", so you will like it as well."
4,Romping and imaginative,"The conceit of this new novel is that it is a recently discovered and long-alluded-to lost work of Isaac Babel, written in the summer of 1936, during his last visit to his hometown of Odessa. It is a daring undertaking, and Rosenstone largely pulls it off (only at times giving his narrator a bit much knowledge of contemporary events), delivering a romping and imaginative firsthand (and, yes, Babel-esque) view of life in the brutal chaos that was Russia of the 1930s. (Reviewed inRussian Life)"
5,A Reference Guide for the New Millennium.,"As we enter the 21st Century, workplace dynamics have dramatically changed. The old paradigm has been replaced and now individuals must accept responsibility for managing their own careers. Melancon provides proven, real-world techniques for successful job search and career management in an easy to read reference format. This book is a ""must read"" for anyone who will be managing human resources and/or their own career into the new millennium."
3,not very detailed,"this book fails to offer any advice for following up after a first interview (beyond the standard thank you letter). Whether to write, call, etc."
3,A First Time for Love,Christian Slater and MAry Stuart Masterson both shine in this movie. Even though this is the same stroy line in many love stories like Sleepless in Seattle. This movie does prove that love does conquer all.
5,If God ever made a romantic comedy starring Christian Slater,"I refuse to respond to some of the earlier reviews that said this movie lost all credibility when it portrayed Slater as heterosexshual male florist. That's just ridiculous people! My Uncle Arthur has been a florist for many years and he couldn't not be more of a man.In fact, to show what a good guy he is, he adopted an 18 year old from Costa Rica named Guillermo and now they go antiquing and Ucle Arthur takes him to dance classes so he can meet other Americans. My Uncle cannot dance because of a degenerative hip, but says he gets satisfaction from watching Guillermo ""do it with other partners."""
5,This is one of the greatest romantic movies of all time.,Christian Slater and Mary Stuart Masterson are terrific. The story line is wonderful and very sweet. Anyone with half a heart would enjoy this love story.
3,Good so far,"So far the book is okay for my class, but some of the descriptions are a little confusing! It definitely compliment's my professor's lectures and it's sometimes even better."
5,Great Deal,When they show up i thought the box was missing something but like the dumb A that I am didn't know that you have to fill them with something. I used rice instead of sand or bean because the rice seems to be more flexable.
3,A decent Start,"This is a good start if your just getting into Mozart or Classical music, but if your not then don't buy it. It's only segments of certain songs, and when the track ends you feel very unsatisfied"
4,Change of pace,Good for those wanting to get away from the everyday experience and expand their music horizons. May be good for those who want to make their work day a little easier to deal with.
4,whisper drive,"Delivered fast, with all parts. Easy installation. only bad thing vibration causes lights to go out I have tried extra tightning but still lights vibrate off."
3,"Great motor, cheap main opener","I have other Chamberlin openers in a 2nd home and thought I was buying the same. Turns out the motor is the same but the other items are different. This is a very good product, quiet, and powerful. Confused as to why they would cheapen it up so much with the main controller that you use everyday. 5 stars if they put a decent switch that will last."
4,"Quiet, works well, but fussy set-up","Mechanically, the unit works quite well, and is really quiet. Installation is pretty straightforward, but getting the controls to work properly has been a frustrating trial-and-error challenge."
3,Quiet operation watch out for spring tensioner,Purchased from Amazon last week and received yesterday. Everything went well until belt installation and tried to set tension on belt.I dont understand why Chamberlain used a inferior spring device to adjust belt tension but mine was faulty. Contacted Chamberlain customer service and they agreed to replace the part but would not ship overnight unless I paid.Only would ship in 5-7 work days. Contacted amazon and as usual they overnighted a replacement.If I had to do over I would have purchased the Craftsmans or another opener.Customer service at Chamberlain was sub par.Also there are steps in the installation manual that are vague and unclear.I am not a professional installer but over the years have installed and repaired several and rate this one low because of the response from customer service and the tensioner device.
4,good garage door opener,"I do not have buyers remorse after installing this opener. The instruction manual was accurate and concise and easy to follow. Everything is of good quality, and the best part is how quiet it is. The remote range is excellent, about 1/2 block. My wife likes that! I like the remote that mounts outside so I can get in without getting into the car for a remote. I would recommend it to my friends without hesitation"
4,Quiet Garage Door Opener,"For the most part, this product is jusr what I wanted. Quiet!!! Much better than the 20 year old chain drive units I was using. Not all that satisfied with the wall units being lit up as bright as they are. Also the pull cord does not retract when activated so the door does not re-engage with the drive when the release cord has been pulled. It's simple to reset it, but it's a pain if one forgets."
1,Light went out after return policy expired,No issues with installation. Instructions could have been a little clearer in a couple of areas (especially around installing the belt) but no issues. I was putting the finishing touches on the opener by putting the light covers on. One of the light covers was deformed - it appears the mold was just a little off. Difficult to attach but I didn't feel like tearing everything down to return it for something that wouldn't affect the functionality.I have now had this opener for a couple of months and while it opens the garage door one of the lights went out. Along with the whisper operation the lights were my second most important criteria for purchasing this unit. I work a lot in the garage and need light. Reviewed the return policy and I can return it for a partial return and I have to spring for shipping. Not a happy customer...
4,"So far, so good","This was a replacement. I was lucky that everything fit into the old setup with little or no changes. It was easy, it was simple, and without a single hiccup. Did not need any extra parts or hardware, did not need any customer service support.The unit operates very quietly as promised, and so do all the controls.However please note that this has only been in place for a month, so that is all I am vouching for.Update as of 11/06/2012:Everything still works fine with the EXCEPTION of one of one of the two mobile REMOTE CONTROLS. It died and no matter how hard I try, it just refuses to work."
5,Great so far,"We bought this to replace a 10 year old chain garage door open. This is noticeably quieter than the chain, with the exception being that we now noticed our actual garage door squeeks a lot (obviously unrelated to the garage door opener).It was relatively easy to install (got someone to do it though). One thing to note, is the outside number pad control is remote, so you don't need to string wire or anything (which is what I was worried about)."
5,Chamberlain Whisper Drive 1/2-HP Belt Drive Garage Door Opener,"The above product was delivered on the estimated delivery date that my order indicated. I went thru the parts list and noticed some parts were missing so I called Chamberlain customer service. It was on a weekend but I got thru to a live rep and she reordered the missing parts which came in a week later. The hardware assembly was precision tooled and fit together nicely. Instructions were very good which allowed me to install it all by myself. I was quite pleased with the sound level of my new Chamberlain Whisper Drive 1/2-HP Belt Drive Garage Door Opener. For 10 years I listened to the old Sears clunker which sounded like a freight train went by every time I used it... what a relief! Overall, I rate the above Chamberlain product and their customer service as excellent, and with Amazon's pricing you can't go wrong."
4,Good But Not Perfect,The jacked is very good but not up to the quality of the Weatherproof brand. Still it is a good value for the price.
2,I wish writers wouldn't mix sf and romance,"Shinn is a good writer, but I am really appalled at this trend of mixing sf and romance.This is a formula romance page turner, well done if you like that sort of thing, but it could have been so much better if she'd paid more attention to the sf aspect of this novel (a la Jaran and Mistwalker). The premise is waaay too cute for me also (what with the gene-engineered angels) and there's no intrigue in finding out exactly what lies behind the fluffy front. In fact, she doesn't even drop any hints. It just is what it is. As an sf fan, I always feel a bit silly complaining about far-fetched plot premises, but even I gagged on this one."
2,not my favorite of Ms. Shinn's,"I am new to Sharon Shinn's writing and loved the four books of the Twelve HOuses. This is the first of the angel books I""ve read, and while the concept is interesting, i found the heroine to be so irritating it was hard for me to wish her well. Which is why i rated the book so low. Still better than many fantasy books but I like her others so much better."
5,Bellevue Bookworm Loves Archangel,"Shinn really drew me into her world! Although the setup and first few chapters worried me, I could not stop after page 30. A wonderful story of love, deception, mystery, and tradition. The best of fantasy and romance. Shinn truly impresses me."
3,Not quite as advertised,"While both the picture and description describe the shank as working with the quick release mandrel, the shank is NOT included with the saw. I purchased both this one, from Geroy's, and the 3 7/8, which was sold by Amazon. I returned the 3 7/8 (which arrived before this one) thinking the shank was suppose to be included and just missing. The second 3 7/8 also arrived without a shank, along with this one, also without a shank."
5,A wonderfully written book of King David,"A wonderful book that compares our lives today to that of King David. So often we feel unworthy - it is very comforting to know that we, like David are sinners yet loved so greatly by our God. I especially appreciated the scriptures followed by an explaination. I chose this book as part of a summer bible reading program through our church. Also part of this program is to read at least 10 of the Psalms - how appropriate! I highly recommend this book to any age level."
1,For the most part Swindoll misses the point,"We used this book for an adult Sunday School class that I taught. I was extremely disappointed by the superficial treatment of the text. I found myself using the Biblical text and other sources. For the most part Dr. Swindoll's book was a distraction rather than a help. For example, 2 Samuel 7 descibesGod's covenant with David that Christ, the True King, would be David's descendant. Swindoll uses this text as to how to react when God says no to our plans. (In this case, it is God's rejection of David as the builder the temple that Solomon eventually built) The covenant IS the point and Dr. Swindoll completely misses it.If your looking for moralisms that you really already knew this is your book. If you want a serious study of the life of Davidyou would do well to look elsewhere or try something bold-- a careful reading of the Biblical text."
4,Great insights about David and a great resource for a biographical study,"I have used this book as a resource, guide, and study-help for a Bible study I have been doing on the life of David.Swindoll offers great insight into the historical context of David's time. He also gives good examples and helps the reader to understand who David was in the world he lived in at that time. At the end of each chapter Swindoll wraps up each chapter with personal applications for the reader.Swindoll does skip (what I feel) are some significant chapters in 1 Samuel 16 to 1 Kings. I would have loved to read his thoughts on some of the passages in David's life that he skips over. Besides that, it is a great book."
3,This is a gel-like creme....,"Bought this based on glowing reviews for this moisturizer. Unfortunately it did not live up to expectations. It turned out to be more of a light gel-creme texture than what I was expecting in a regular face cream. It does smell fresh & nice, but does not moisturize well enough for me & left me with dry patches (even when using lots of product). I would recommend this for someone with oily skin only. I now use this as more of a 'serum' with another moisturizer or sunblock applied over. Did this product produce glowing, firm skin, etc? I really don't know, as my main purpose for getting it was for use as a moisturizer (the soft & dewy effect!) and in that respect it did not work out."
5,ultimate Teacher's Bible,"My rating is a definite 6!! This is more then your average study Bible. It has more than 100 outlines for lessons. It takes the power of a Bible story and links eternal truths and applications for every day living. Also it shows how the gospel relates to many Old and New Testament stories. Many years,I carried a small Bible with me. Now I carry ""The Children's Ministry Resource Bible"" because you never know when a group of bored kids will want to hear an old, old story..."
5,perfect for any moms,I just had my first baby in June and I was given this book by my grandmother. I cannot think of a more perfect book! It can be read over and over again and still be hillarious each time. New and experienced mothers alike will get a kick out of this book. It makes the perfect shower gift!
3,Worth reading,"The story of a boy growing up in war-torn Ethiopia, this book has interesting anecdotes and offers a look into a culture far different from my own. At times, it is quite amusing and interesting, but gets complicated and convoluted when talking about the politics and places. It's helpful to have a map of the region while reading. Never the less, when finished, you will be thankful for the life you've been so privileged to live."
5,PERFECT,"LOOKED FOR THIS MOVIE FOR YEARS, ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT, WISH IT WAS ON DVD THOUGH.WAS A GREAT PRICE ALSO. THANKS"
1,I'm stunned at the positive reviews,"There is absolutely no denying that is a horribly acted piece of tripe. There are no redeeming qualities. And to whomever mentioned things like Grease & West Side Story in the same post with this movie should be throttled and committed.Don't waste your time. Get a GOOD musical. Oklahoma, South Pacific, Paint Your Wagon, Carousel, Grease, Moulin Rouge, Phantom of the Opera, Singin' in the Rain, and the myriad of others made in the 40's, 50's, 60's and beyond.You will never get the time back you waste with this ""film""."
5,One of My Favorties!,"I have loved this movie for about ten years! Everytime i watch it, I get a happy warm feeling. It is a little cheesy sometimes but if you get past that and just enjoy it for what it is, an upbeat love story with lots of dancing and a great soundtrack, you'll like it too. I even own the soundtrack!"
3,"Bleak, and definitely put downable.","The audiofile reviewer has got it wrong. Mary's MOTHER, Alice Lennox, was the young bride in India, not Mary."
2,Inaccurate details ruin story,"This just isn't an accurate look at small towns, school nurses, or farming. Too many details are so contrived they make the entire story unbelievable. No farmer would sew up his cow with a shoestring; school nurses do not work in a vacuum in a school - one just cannot be that isolated in a small town. I got the feeling the author had a plot, developed some characters, but attempted to create a setting she knew nothing about."
1,Couldn't even finish it!,"""A Map....."" was sooooo boring I had to stop in the middle due to lack of interest! Very uncommon for me to do, I usually give it my best shot to finish it. This, however, was not the case with this book! Alice was a freak and her husband Howard was a negligent parent. I may pick this book up in years to come but I seriously doubt it! I have read a lot of books in my time and this has to be one of the worst!"
3,A Strong Read,I liked it! It was not at all what I thought it would be. The end was a bit anti-climatic but overall I thought it was worth the time. It could be a bit slow paced but it always picked up again. An enjoyable read.
2,Well written but slow,"This is a book about the severe hardships a woman, and consequently her family, endures during a particularly turbulent time of their life. the book well written and semi-interesting, but it is slow...the plot inches at a snail's pace, and is often distracted by the author's flashbacks, tangents, descriptions, etc...Particularly mind-numbing were the chapters relating to Alice's flashbacks of her prison experience...Maybe I didnt like Alice too much, but at that point in the book, I could honestly care less what happened to her.the only excitement the plot offered were the courtroom scenes towards the very end.Finally, I would not highly reccommend this book, it's just too boring..."
4,A thoughtful read,"This is not a book to read on an escape vacation. It is well written and easy to read, but it is very serious content. It requires reflection and dealing with dark emotions. Don't read when dealing with depression!"
2,Tedious,"I read this book while captive on a transatlantic flight. It did hold my interest, but I got impatient at times with the whiney characters and the oh-so-excessive wordiness of the writing. The book was in desperate need of a good editing to eliminate the belaboring of just about everything. I do identify with the anguish of Alice over the death of Lizzy. Isn't it every mother's nightmare to have a moment of inattention result in tragedy? That situation is what drew me in and lead me to finish the book."
1,How sad and depressing,"I couldn't finish this book. I couldn't get past the first 75 pages if that. I found this horribly depressing. Not necessarily a badly written novel, but it is so saddening tha I just could pull myself through this book. The main character is obviously from page one depressed and hugely disapointed with her life. And it just gets worse from there. I still have this book (book mark and all!) on the shelf in hopes that maybe I will feel up to this book. The premise of the book seems good and this is why I am holding on to it. I supoose if I run out of other books to read, this will makes its way off the shelf."
2,"Boring, boring, boring!","This is by far one of the most boring books I have ever read. I couldn't get into it at all--I didn't care for switching viewpoints a hundred and fifty pages into things, and then switching back again a hundred pages after that. The endless descriptions were tedious, and I ended up skipping over most of them just to get to the action. Truth be told, I still haven't finished this book yet and don't plan on it. It's sitting on my coffee table gathering dust, because frankly I have no interest in finding out what happens to these characters."
2,Print too small for reading.,The 1995 paperback Anchor Books Edition caused me eye strain and I was not going to read the 389 pages with such ridiculously small print !
2,Disapointment,"I think this was a very disapointing book. I expected it to be a drama, but I didn't think that the end would be so negative or that after reading it I would be left with such a jilted feeling about the book. I just didn't find the quality epic I wanted to find through the main characters, and the neighbor and husband never redeemed themselves in my opinion. I am the type of reader that has a hard time putting a book down once I've started it. I feel like I've invested in it and I always think that good things will come... This is one of those books I should have just laid down and forgotten about."
4,A modern American tragedy,"The novel definately falls into the category of ""tragedy"", but is not actually depressing to read -- the writer is that good. Jane Hamilton takes on a cultually explosive topic, child sexual abuse, and writes about it in such a way that I was put in mind of the Joe Paterno public opinion trial as I was reading. It is enough to simply be accused to ruin your life as you have known it. It doesn't matter if you are proved innocent, the outcome is similar except that you don't actually do any jail time other than what you had to serve while awaiting trial since the bail was set so high for this very special crime. It is very much like a modern-day witch trial.There aren't any perfect characters in this novel, which is pretty much the way it is in real life. The writing is very good, sometimes inspired. I loved Alice's description of Robbie Mackessy's wanton mother: ""I watched her walk down the hall in an intricate gait like a horse that has spent its life learning dressage."""
4,Good,"I read this book when it first was released. Now I am a mother of a two yr old(who has time for ""mom"" books now! ) This book is Excellent! I was moved so much, that I still remember alot of the story! I can see why this was made into a movie. READ the book first, it will give the story so much more depth, than a movie could achieve solo. This aurthor is one to look out for."
2,A VERY SLOW READ,"I WAS VERY DISAPOINTED IN IT...I DONT THINK THE TITLE HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE STORY LINE? BASICALLY IT WAS BORING, TO ME."
1,Awful,I find it very difficult to get through half of this book. I have put it down and picked it up more times than I care to mention. It is a waste of time. Awful book...
3,"Well-Written, but flawed","The book was well-written, but I thought it had more than its share of flaws. I felt the shifting point-of-view did not add much to the novel, Howard's section was flat. The prison sequences did not ring true to me, that whole part of the experience could have been left out.Also, bringing in a ""surprise"" witness at the end to win the case was a cheap trick. It felt like a made-for-television courtroom drama at that point.I guess, in summary, the book starts strong, but weakens at it goes along. A good read, but could have been better."
2,Failed to do research,"I was bothered right away by the author's lack of reserach. When the main character is described as a ""licensed practitioner nurse,"" it was clear that Hamilton didn't even bother to do rudimentary research. There are licensed practical nurses and nurse practitioners, but Hamilton's jumble of the two was disappointing and confusing. Also, it was clear Hamilton relied on pure speculation to guide her writing about child abuse. Overall, a good enough story, marred by the author's failure to do her homework."
2,A DIS-CONNECT: Just couldn't care about Alice!,"I wanted to get into this book, I really did. But I couldn't. I forced myself half-way through it, then couldn't go any further. Months later, I tried again with fresh eyes, picking up where I left off but making it only 50 or so more pages. I just didn't care enough about the character of Alice to go on. I never felt any real connection to her. I don't necessarily need to like a character -- and indeed I didn't like Alice, so mundane, unfocused, with such poor life/interpersonal skills -- but I need to at least FEEL something for a character to see a novel through to its end. I simply didn't care about Alice's predicament or its outcome. Moreover, I found the author's writing style often long-winded and detached. Sorry -- just don't know what all the fuss is about on this one!"
2,It just goes on and on and on....,"The first paragraph of the book was such a masterpiece, I thought I was in for a treat. It must've taken a year of rewrites just to get that one paragraph right. But it went downhill fast from there. The painfully endless dull descriptive paragraphs after that made me stop by page 90, but then I stubbornly resumed and plowed through to the end. I couldn't read fast enough to move onto another book. Too realistic (which I guess is complimentary), too painful, just plain too much. Sorry. I wanted to like it."
5,awsome,what a remarcable woman!!!!She not only trust in God but went all the way to show He was trustworthyan ordinary person doing extraordinary things !!!!!Her Faith accomplished miracles !!!!!!
1,Terrible animation but my daughter loves it!,"It's bargain basement stuff, and the animation looks like it was done on Amiga Deluxe Paint in someone's bedroom. Sound is awful, and the music cluttered.BUT... my little girl loves it, and she can't get enough of it. She loves telling me about the shapes, and what they've done. So it can't be all bad!"
4,25 Classical Favorites,"I love this disc. I use it in my classroom while my high school students get there work done!They Also love it!Only things is, when i copied it onto my itunes a handful of the songs skip or cutout. otherwise the disc itself is great!"
5,Great collection,"This is a great collection of classical pieces. I have no idea how they can offer this so cheap. Just thinking of all the orchestra players. Not sure how anyone is getting paid for their work here!. Anyway, great collection to have.Voice Lessons To Go v.1-4 The Complete Set"
3,bEtHoVeN mAnIaC,"[...] Honestly, it isn't THAT THAT great, but its good enough for its price. I'd say that your $ pays off, for a while. I've noticed how after a long time, it gets aggrivating at times. No harm meant, ""Beethoven lover"". I just mean don't plunge into this cd with all the hopes in the world. Besides, it's just my opinion, so you may like it more than me. All i can say is; a) listen to some samples before you buy, b)know this is not REALLY the great Beethoven himself, and c) enjoy YOUR music, whatever it may be."
3,Not the Best of Best!,Disappointing! I had expected the CD to contain tracks of Public Television performances. Not so!
2,Wow ... dying embers tarnish near-epic INFERNO,"Shame, shame, shame ...Without giving away the ending, it's hard to write a review of the book and remain impartial, but I will say that the readers are, perhaps, cheated by one of the shoddiest 'outs' in Trek/book history.The first two-thirds of this novel is incredible, building up to a climax that isn't so much an INFERNO (a title never really explained literally nor metaphorically although one could substitute a variety of interpretations) as it is a dying campfire.Characterizations are dead on accurate (accept for a bit over the top Quark and Vic Fontaine, who spouts more than one-too-many pallies ... in fact, if Vic had behaved the way the book portrays him, the clever and thoughtful residences of DS9 would've probably deprogrammed him).Sad ending to what could've been an epic conclusion."
4,So fast I was getting dizzy,"I never read the first two books, which made it difficult for me to understand. I still found it very confusing. Other than that small drawback, it is by far the best DS9 book written. Reeves-Stevens are some of the best writers in Trek today, and I knew when I found it that this would be good as well. They have a good understanding of space and time travel, which makes the book more authentic. If you're looking for a wild ride, you found a great one!"
3,Not bad.,"This series as a whole I would rate four stars, but since no individual book in the series stands on its own, I dock them each one star when rating them individually. The series as a whole is a very ambitious project, over 1000 pages of story with a very convoluted plot involving multiple time-travel interconnections of cause and effect, a very difficult concept to pull off well. The authors MOSTLY manage the concept well, but I'm not certain that they actually succeed; it's all just too complex for me. I suspect that multiple reading in a short time would be required to actually judge the effectiveness with which they carry out their concept, rather than one reading in fits and starts over a couple of months, but frankly, I didn't find the book compelling enough to justify giving it that much attention."
3,"ok,, but not great","Projection works fine, and as expected worthless during daytime in a well lit room. I was just hoping the face of the clock showed the time MUCH larger, and could be permenantly backlit. The clock sits at a funny angle and the face is pretty much unreadable from more than 5 feet during the daytime and unreadable in a dark room, it will become backlit if you hit the snooze bar. Lastly, the alarm tone is digital watch quality, something with a little more character would be nice. It's fine, but I would have been happier if it was half the cost because it's really not that special for me."
1,What a disappointment!,"I was so looking forward to this DVD boxed set and now I am just so disappointed. What were they thinking? Right off the bat I looked for Truman Capote but he is not in it. I looked for Lucille Ball, nope. There is no Bette Davis, no Joan Crawford etc. Merv was his best with the larger than life ladies and his interviews with Truman Capote were fascinating. They really screwed this up. I doubt there will be a second boxed set but if there is I hope they get it right."
2,"Too much footage, not enough discs","Overall, it was great to see some of the classic interviews from the show, but they are really edited. Just when you get into the clip, it's over. For example, Orson Wells' last interview, conducted 2 hours before he passed away, was just getting interesting when it just fades into the next guest. Also, there is no way of telling how equal the editing of the interviews are - the Jack Benny interview is nearly 30 minutes while the George Burns interview is over in about 3 minutes.Instead of this set including 3 discs with 3 different themes, there should have been 3 dvd sets each devoted to a particular theme. Check out the Dick Cavett dvd sets and you'll see what I mean - complete shows, complete intervies and great bonus features."
5,Amazing what was accomplished on the budget. AMAZING,It was better than many major movies that I have seen. Watch it and see if you agree....for first timers AAA+++
3,One of his lesser works,"I have seen all but 2 of Eric Rohmer's feature films, and being that he is my favorite director I am very critical of what I like and don't like. This movie is ideal for two types of people: Francophiles who enjoy different sights and sounds of beautiful Paris (at times the movie is almost like a travelogue, especially in the 2nd story) and Eric Rohmer completists. This movie was a real treat compared to Rohmer's last few movies, which were becoming more tedious and uninteresting since ""A Tale of Springtime"". This movie was made at the same time Rohmer was in the midst of his Four Seasons series and pales in comparison to any of them. Rohmer fans will love it and people looking for a slight, forgettable talkfest in Paris. For anyone looking to enter the world of Rohmer, I'd recommend the two films that immediately proceeded this one, ""A Summer's Tale"" & ""Autumn Tale"" over this"
5,My Favorite Album Ever,"Ok, you probably can't trust me completely in this review because, as my title states, this is my favorite album ever. Let me say that if you want something like the first Days album check out Tantric or Creed or whatever bland formulaic schlock some guy in an office on the top of some skyscraper in New York City decides he wants to give him your money for. If you enjoy music that is Progressive (ie King Crimson, Jethro Tull, Tool, etc.) and full of walls of sound, then buy this album. It is a voyage into the heart. Also, you might try Travis Meeks' favorite group Dead Can Dance for more expansive soulful music."
3,"Eagerly anticipated, but easily forgotten.","Just got the CD this morning, and listened to it all day in my car. Overall, this album is not the group's best effort. Although the lyrics are still dark and pensive, they lack the intensity and originality that exemplified their first album. Travis tries to expand his musical style by incorporating more upbeat melodies, and experiments with a variety of sounds and instruments. I feel he tried too hard to change an already good thing. None of the songs were particularly memorable after the first listening other than ""The Real"" and ""Enemy."" Perhaps it'll grow on me after I listen to it again. Of course, this CD is a must-have for any die-hard fan, but not a necessity for the average listener. I love Travis, but that's the way I feel about this new album so far. By the way, what happened to band members Jesse West and Todd Whitener?"
2,Just OK - Not Truely Exceptional Like Their First CD,"I was generally disappointed with this album. I thought the first Days of the New CD was truely exceptional - it remains one of my top 5 favorite CDs which I listen to on a daily basis. However, this CD was just ok and did not live up to the standard set by their first CD."
3,Not as powerfull as the 1st. Should have kept his old band !,"This album is not nearly as captivating as the first. ""Days"" should have stuck to their power acoustic sound and stayed away from the mixing room. Sounds a bit over-produced, I bet a lot of the best stuff has been lost in the translation."
5,Brilliance!,"While this album wasn't a commercial runaway, its artistic depth made it one of the best releases of 1999. ""Weapon And The Wound"" and ""Enemy"" are simply the best songs Travis Meeks has written to date and I look forward to his new album, ""Days Of The New 3,"" more than ever.Try this album in the car stereo on a long drive through the mountains with the windows down, or in your headphones on a long hike, and I can assure you it will be a favorite for years to come."
4,"Way left of normality, a very artistic album...","I would not recommend this to someone who only liked the mainstream songs of DOTN's first CD. I would recommend it to someone who would like something different and something you do not see everyday. Days of the New II is a 62 minutes of artistic music which sometimes yields great music that is unlike any other, yet other times is just...weird. Songs like ""Flight Response"" and ""Weapon and the Wound"" are strange listening at its best with greatly executed guitar and poetic lyrics. ""Untitled"" is a mix of indistict sounds arranged in such a way that it is disturbing, guaranteed to raise the hair of the back of your neck.All in all, ""Days of the New II"" is like an abstract painting converted to sound. It explores emotions and other intangable concepts in a most eclectic way."
4,Very nice sampler,"As someone who is not a big classical aficionado, this was a great way to get a little bit of everything while avoiding the crashy-bangy ""Overture of 1812"" stuff that I can't stand. My particular favorite is track 9, ""Reverie"" by Debussy. Absolutely goes to the core of my being; when I am deeply upset I play this track and I am transported into a realm of peace and tranquility I can't get to any other way. I'd buy the CD for that track alone, but the others are good as well. As with any compilation there are a couple that you will always skip over. But overall it's a good CD and I keep it in my car for whenever I need it."
3,It's OK for what it's worth...,"I bought this at Fry's Electronics last June for less than $4 (employee discount..wink!), and for what it's worth its a fairly decent headset. It's true what the other reviews said about the ""gelleez"" comment: the main earbuds that go inside your ears are plastic and the gummy parts are the just wire and the cup coverings. The sound is ok, nothing like a Sennheiser or a Bose earbuds (of course), but about the same quality, or better than Coby and Koss el cheapo earbuds. Comfort-wise, I have smallish ear canals so it hurts when I use it for more than an hour.Would I recommend it? If you get it for less than $6, its great...buy it for anything more than $9.99, then it's a ripoff."
4,Nice Pair of Earbuds,"It is a decent pair of earbuds for the price. It is comfortable to my ears but may easily not for others. Buds are made of hard rubber and not really soft enough (not ""jellylike"" or ""jeleez"" as the package seems to convey) to conform with the shape of your inner ears.Pros:- Inexpensive- Good audio at both low and high volume (What would you ask for a 5-10$ earbuds? I am not expecting it to sound like a 99$ Bose or 300$ Shure)- No detachable foam or silicon buds to loseCons:- The size of the earbuds will not fit everybody.- The cord is too wiry and rubbery. The surface is a dust magnet."
1,Waste of time,This movie is as much about Wild Bill as The Blues Brothers is. Waste of time. there's a reason it was such a Dog when it was originally released.
3,"JOHN HUSTON, OPUS 22","Good Tennessee Williams adaptation. The good surprise of the film is Ava Gardner who's not as hieratic as she seems after all, thanks to John Huston. Nonetheless, Joseph L. Mankiewicz'sSuddenly, Last Summerremains the reference among Tennesse William's adaptations. Recommended."
5,Really helpful information,"I read the book and really like it, so I decided to get it in a form I can take with me as needed. It has some really enlightening information in it. Whenever you start going through the Shoulda, Coulda, Woulda's dig this book or CD out and review it."
5,"gorgeous, I am madly in love with this album","I haphazardly stumbled upon this band while on mp3.com looking for cocteau twins similar artists, the album cover did not look promising but it is what's inside that counts, ey?they sound like all of my favorite artists in one super sexy package. This cd is in heavy rotation on my stereo, it never becomes redundant or tiresome, each track is impressive and incredibly catchy, songs like ""Shaky shaky bells"" are Cocteau twin-ish, Mercurine is a bit more new-wave sounding than the aforementioned band at times."
2,Didn't Work For Me,"I suffer from arthritis pretty badly in my hands, especially the fingers, and I decided to give this a try because of the anthocyanins and their purported efficacy in treating RA, or at least alleviating some of the pain. However, unlike some of the other reviewers here, I noticed no change in my pain, even after two months. Maybe I should have given it a longer trial, but pain is pain, and because I gained absolutely no relief for it, I have since moved on to trying other things."
1,Does not fit,This item does not fit a 2010 Chevrolet Silverado as Bully says. I ordered one from streetsideauto and it does not match. Now I am fighting with them over the return fees.
2,A few design flaws,This design needs some work. Here the issues that I had:1) tabs don't hold (not long enough) and bezel wants to fall off2) sides don't don't sit flush to the truck3) locking mechanism is very tight and needs grease
1,Junk,"Purchased this for a 04 Chevy Silverado Z-71. After messing with this for over an hour and a half, it is now installed. We had to rethread it so that we could actually get a bolt to screw in and the bolt that was sent was a weird thread so we ended up using our own. It also doesn't allow my tailgate handle to completely lower when you let go of it because the it is hitting the lock. I would not purchase this product. Chevrolet ought to standardize this on every new truck so we don't have to deal with that. We will see how long this piece of crap lasts, from the other reviews, it looks like not very long."
1,Toxic Smelling,"These had a horrible toxic smell to them when I first opened the bag. The bag smelled like vinyl to me. At first, I thought the blocks just absorbed the smell of the plastic bag. But they wouldn't air out and even after being machine washed they still stunk. I think they may have polyurethane foam in them, which is definitely toxic and can offgas for awhile. That may have been what I was smelling. I have another foam / cloth ball by them that didn't smell as bad. I gave my daughter that... I couldn't give her these, though. I didn't want her mouthing them.All Haba cloth toys are also made in CHINA."
5,Phenomenal Light Ocean Scent with T&H Quality Shaving,"OK, so I heard that 1805 was the top seller for T&H.; I had previously purchased the Grafton cream about a month before and have been very impressed with the quality. Trafalgar was a total dive, so you can see my review there.I will probably get shot for saying this, but 1805 is kind of like a Nautica ocean scent, but WAY higher quality. You can smell it quite well during shaving time, but it becomes more subdued afterwards. If you want a face that is only slightly perfurmed after a shave, but want a very high quality latherific experience then I would recommend 1805."
2,ok,Make sure to take care of them first time i used a rinsed them off and the next day there was rust all over the knives and scissors. SO you pay 20 for a one time use. I guess I should have soaked them in veggie oil after use and it wouldn't have rusted but I figure you get what you pay for.
3,A Gift,Bought this for my father n law. Not sure he has even opened it up yet. It is too cold in Missouri to fish right now. I think he liked it though.
2,Doobies Out-takes,"This is a nice little album from Tom Johnston; it sounds very much like a Doobies album but without I'm sorry to say very good songs. It is even produced by Ted Templeman!! Standout track for me is 'Savannah Nights'. The rest of the very short album (29 minutes) just flows away.Why did Wounded Bird not release this album together with ""Still Feels Good"" (33 minutes) on 1 CD ?"
3,Ran out of steam,"Very good book that seemed to run out of steam the last hundred pages. Unique and imaginative ideas, but enough already with Lord Valentine winning all the time. Where did the conflict go? Silverberg is a great sci fi author, among the best, but this epic work just lost me at the end."
3,Far from living up to the hype,"I was quite disappointed by this book. From the other reviews, I expected something suspenseful and wondrous a la Terry Brooks or Andre Norton. What I got was a very predictable plotline that seemed to drag-on forever. There was no great sorcery or magic, only a sort of Jedi mind control from a diminutive wizard. There were no epic battles as I was expecting, no twist or turns and no interesting or strange beasts. Only the geography of Majipoor lived up to the fantasy. The unusual beasts that were present were unimpressive and boring. The fact that it was well written, as I would expect from Silverberg, allows me to give it three stars rather than one. Most of the story just involves a group of jugglers traveling to destiny, so if you like road adventures, this may be for you. Just don't expect epic fantasy."
4,Read en re-read this book.,"I read this book some years ago and was very pleased to notice that it recently has been translated in dutch, so I could recommand it to friends. I read the mahjipoor chronicles too en hope to find the other books about mahjipoor."
5,"A colored pencil enthusiast from Alliance, Ohio","This book is a must-have! Not only for those who work primarily in colored pencil, but for anyone who is interested in drawing, still life, the use of color, composition, and realistic style. The book is clearly written, well organized, packed with information, and a delight to view. The many beautiful photographs of completed works rendered solely by these two accomplished artists distinguish this book. The compatible style of Janie Gildow and Barbara Benedetti Newton better support the narrative guidelines and step-by-step demonstrations than any other drawing book in my collection. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to explore or expand their options in artistic expression."
5,My favorite,This is one of my favorite Colored Pencil Instruction Book. I keep coming back to it for artistic inspiration. I highly recommend trying out all of the exercises. Your skills will improve dramatically.
1,Intro Material,The information in the book is designed for those with no practical experience. If you expect to pass the exam... skip this one! This book doesn't come close to the complexities covered on the exam... moreover most of the code and definitions are copied directly from the online help with VS.NET...
2,Definitely there are better books,"I think that there are more interesting books about C# and MCP Certification.The negative points of this books are:- Are missing a lot of details of the .NET technology- The sample codes are not complete, only show portions- It is not enough to take an MCP testPositive points are:- It is a great book for introducing the .NET technology- Contains a lot a sample questions oriented to take the MCP testAs a summary of the .NET technology, it is great!"
1,Completely Worthless,"I bought this book as it was the first to come out covering preperations for the MCAD and MCSD. I read through the entire book and came out very disappointed. There are numerous typos for a start and the code style is often very inconsistent making the examples all the harder to read. The information is very light. Compared with some of the other options available such as Amit Kalani's MCAD/MCSD books there is only a grain on information. If you take the test soley on Microsoft's book I think you will find yourself woefully under prepared. Last, there are precious few questions, no tips, and little in the way of examples to work through. The book is a brief skim of topics that are covered in much better detail elsewhere. Don't waste your time with this one."
5,where's the poop,"Excellent tool to get kids interested in pooping on the toilet!I have been at this for months, and my daughter loved the book, so we read it one time when it first arrived and then saved it for poop time on the toilet...we read it every time and it is great because of all the pop ups and illustrations!"
1,Seedling Clothes Tree,"Be sure to look at the dimensions - this thing is waist high. A towel will hit the floor. It doesn't look like that from the images. Also, it's cheap wood and the parts do no screw in straight so it's crooked."
4,Good introduction to Tintin,"This book is good as a brief introduction to Tintin. Is very concise, allowing the reader to quickly capture a glimpse of Herge's work. Most of the text unfortunately has been later plagiarized by Michael Farr. This book still retains a large number of interesting illustrations not present in the latter book. Therefore I recommend getting the French edition of Peeters' book, which is readily available and less expensive than the hard to find English translation. This way you can read the more in-depth material from Farr's book, then examine the additional illustrations here. Note that both books draw heavily on Numa Sadoul's conversations with Herge, published separately in French."
5,Tintin and the world of Herge,I have been a fan of Tintin since I was 5 years old. This book filled me in on the entire story of Tintin and his creator. This book is a good buy for a true Tintin fan.
1,Waste of time!,"I have read other books by Christina Dodd & liked them. Which is why I read this one. What a disappointment! Story plot was o.k. But character development was poor. I like reading stories where I like the characters, at least like them at some point in the story & wish they'll be happy in the end. But this story was so boring, dragging on that I couldn't care less what happened in the end. Only because of my silly compulsion to finish every book I start, I ended up wasting a few hours of my time on this book. BTW, I did like the ""Rules of engagement"" in the same series very much! I liked Hannah Settrington in that story, which is why I got this book. My humble opinion is that Avoid reading this book unless you've nothing better to do."
5,A great author does it again!!,"This book has such clever twists and turns in the plot, a hero to die for (maybe literally), a spunky heroine and the dotty old aunts who were so funny and touching. Rules of Attraction stands alone, you don't have to read the other two Rules books, but I would. Great series! Great finish!More!"
1,Why would anyone fall for Dougald?,"I do not understand why ANY woman would want to be with a man like Dougald. I like books where the characters evolve, but I didn't get the sense that Dougald evolved at all.He was so unbearably cruel and mean to Hannah in this book. He even talks to himself about how ""easy"" it would be to kill her! And he's the ""hero""? Not in my world. He never acknowledges his part in his failed marriage and is so pathetic that he's planned revenge on the innocent young woman who ran from him nine years ago. Get a life, Dougald!He's mean to Hannah, and takes pleasure in her pain. That isn't love.I kept hoping for some glimpse into Dougald that would salvage this tortured and torturing character but I found none. I would have run away from this ogre too.Please, writers, get back to ROMANCE.Readers, save your money and read all of Julia Quinn's books or Suzanne Enoch's. THOSE are heroes to remember.....Kat"
4,my 15 year old son loved it,"I got this for my 15 year old civil war buff son for Christmas. He LOVED the game! He's a game whiz but it surprised me that he had beaten it after about a total of 10 hours of play (not all at once). He wished it was a two player game so he could play with his friend, but thats the only complaint he had. If i get the free time i might try to play it, it looks intersting enough. As an adult i like more challanging games but if its a gift for a teen i think it's a good bet, especially if you want to get your kid interested in history."
4,A fun lesson in history,"This game is not especially difficult to play, but has the reward of teaching history lessons after each battle. I bought it for my grandson to play on his PS2, and feel it was well worth the price."
1,civil war,well first of all the graphics a horrible like the first ghost recon and it said rated for blood and violence but there was no blood an in the first 10 min. of playing it it started swearing in the text below the screen so i give it one star.
2,Did anyone proofread this rough draft?,Another book rushed to press before it was finished. Numerous contradictions and incorrect answers. Shame on the author and publisher for publishing this sloppy work. Why can't publishers hire a technical reviewer to keep mistakes like this from happening?
5,First taste of the horror of Lovecraft...,"This is a great set of some of Lovecraft's stories. Not the best, book good for what it is. This is my first book of Lovecraft stories, and has gotten me hooked onto all of works. This book contains sixteen stories. Not all are great, but none are bad. Some of the ones in here that I love is Herbert West - Reanimater, The Hound (scared the heck out of me!), The Outsider (the band Nile gets their debut album title from this book), Cool Air, The Lurking Fear, The Shadow Over Innsmouth (a Lovecraft classic), and others. If you're looking for any of the stories that are within the Cthulhu mythos, you won't find any here (though Shadow Over Innsmouth contains a brief reference to Cthulhu). You get sixteen stories, some awesome, some good, for a cheap price. If you want a collection with some of his best stories, then get The Best of H.P. Lovecraft: Bloodcurdling Tales of Horror and Macabre."
4,Entertaining History for a Young Audience,"I remember being fascinated by the American Presidents as a child. This book allows me to share that interest with my third-grade daughter. It is entertaining and well written. It celebrates the diversity of our presidents and lets children know that anyone can grow up to be president. There is not one set of characteristics that describes our presidents. The book has charming illustrations, and is written in easy language. The book celebrates presidential achievements, and it does not gloss over the shortcomings of the presidents whose reputations were tarnished by impeachment. My daughter is most pleased that there is a bowling alley and a movie theater in the White House. I hope she understands the message that she could strive for great things, and maybe in 40 years you'll see me on the dias at her inaugaration."
2,Could have been better,The pictorial of President Taft is kind of disparaging. It's a picture of him naked being lowered by a crane into a bath as he stuffs his face. Okay so during his presidency he weighed 300lbs. He also was the only president to serve all three branches of government. Kind of impressive. Chief Justice is briefly mentioned in what appears to be an appendix. The appendix that also credits Obama for bank and corporate bailouts.
1,Not a learning tool,"The satire of the Presidents is fine, although, the information obtained in this book is not legitimate, the illustration at times does not match what the story is saying. There are many inconsistences when the pictures are not accurate with the era. I just do not understand how this could have been a Caldecott winner."
4,Engineers notebook,"This is the highest quality spiral bound notebook in this format that I am aware of. I would recommend using a permanent type of ink pen or pencil in order to create a document that will create as near to permanent written record as possible. It is my opinion that if one is engaged in any sort of professional occupation, or occupies a position of responsibility where one may be called upon to provide documentation of conversations, actions or whatever in a world where lawyers can require one to give testimony to protect themselves, then only the best will do. It is expensive, but documentation of certain information is invaluable."
4,Unique,"Not exactly what I expected, but I like it. I can read and work while enyoying this music playing.MK"
3,Helpful for the average person,"This book is helpful and has lots of good exercise info but being a woman who runs, weight trains and does yoga I already knew most information offered and was an unneccesary buy =(."
2,Not that great.,"I regret buying this book; I'm sure there's a better pregnancy exercise book out there. It didn't meet my expectations. Some of the recommendations on exercises broken down by trimester were useful; I wish there was more of that. After those sections, the chapters are broken down by activity which wasn't as helpful. Also, I was shocked that they put exercises to do with your baby; as in holding your baby and rolling him up and down like a barbell! How dangerous is that, at least a first-time parent like me would think so."
4,Travel places in Europe while following some interesting folks.,"Although this type of story is not my favorite subject matter, the murder mystery did keep my interest. I knew the author from working with him in Estes Park in the summer of 1968 and wanted to read his book. I would recommend this as a good read for those who enjoy a suspence that takes place from Texas, over to Europe, and also in the Yucatan jungle. Most guys would love this bloody thriller."
5,This is a wonderful book,"This is one book that becomes a tradition. When the anniversary of the first time you read it comes around, you'll find yourself going to the bookcase, digging it out, and reading it again. It will give you a kind of sad, joyful feeling everytime. The book also gives you different perspective on the 1958 Ford Edsel. As for my daughter and I we bought a 1958 metal cast model of a 1958 Edsel convertible. Everytime we see it sitting on the shelf that joyful sad feeling sweeps through our hearts again. If you ever wondered what it was like being a preachers kid, ""St. Ben"" will dispell all the myths. So be prepared to make it a tradition the first time you read it."
5,thank goodness!,"I ordered this strap kit to keep the heavy bookcases at my son's house from tipping when his little boy tries to climb on the bookcase. Now, with the strap kit everyone is safe."
1,Concerto Favorites,Product defective -- several glitches. Please notify me of return or replacement process.
3,Fascinating and a bit creepy,"We took this book out of local library after recommendation from a friend. It's fascinating! The illustrations are very details and one can spend hours investigating them. I was dissatisfied with the ""keys"" themselves, though. On the search after the keys to the author's childhood home he finds three scrolls with three Prague's folk tales. The tales are written in a neat script in the middle of scroll-decorated page fold. Even as an adult I found the tales difficult to read and not engaging enough to bother to read. Let alone if I were a kid! Overall, it's a good study-introductory book, but it's is unclear what the target audience is. Certainly not early elementary."
5,Haba Starter Blocks,"This is a great set of blocks. On a hard surface, my son count tally the blocks 4.5 feet high, he is 6 yrs old. On the carpet also, these blocks stack up well. This is keeping my son very happy, and it does not clutter my apartment either. It is safe for My 17 month old daughter to play with."
5,Close Second To Crosny,"A vast majority of today's music mavens will not recognize the name of Al Bowlly, popular band singer of England. His voice sang the songs of the jazz Age and all in a great baritone range.I stumbled across a recording or two of his and Ray Noble (popular band leader)..hooked on his voice.He willingly professed admiring Bing's style and copied some of it....but, he wss his own manand popular singer...Al was killed in a Blitz on London in 1941."
2,"I know they aren't not built to last., or get out of the package!","Fun idea.. really, really fun idea.However, I gave each of my teenagers (11 & 14), a Reindeer Jelly Bean Candy Pooper. It was some task for the kids (and the rest of the family) to get the dam things out of the packaging w/o breaking them. The first one lost it's rear legs before getting all the way out of the package. woof! The second one stay together long enough to see the new year. TIP use a razor blade and be careful of the legs!"
3,Fact Check,"This book won an honorable mention (one of six in no order of precedence) in the HSA Merit Book Awards for books published in 1988 (award made in 1999). That year, the top three prizes went, respectively, to Nicholas A. Virgilio's *Selected Haiku*, Rod Willmot's *Sayings for the Invisible*, and Jane Reichhold's *Tigers in a Teacup*. The award is documented in *A Haiku Path*, the history of the first 20 years of the Haiku Society of America, published by the society."
5,Love this album,"I often listen to this album while cleaning up dinner, and moving into a more relaxing mode. Great choices - many wonderful favorites."
1,CD a Dud,"The CD I received came from Amazon Return Center. On my stereo at home absolutely no sound came out. I tried it out in my car, and it played, but with blips every few seconds. The CD is no good, but since I opened the package I can't return it, and nowhere on this site can I find a place to discuss this matter with an Amazon representative. At least the CD is an inexpensive one, so I'll eat the cost. But I think I'll order my CD's from a local store from now on. This review shouldn't even earn one star, but I couldn't proceed without checking it."
3,jump,"There are a few scenes in this film that will make the hairs on your head stand! These jumps will chill even the most jaded, seen-it-all horror fans."
4,NOT REALLY A HORROR FILM! ALTHOUGH THERE ARE A FEW GREAT SCARES!,"I was able to catch a sneak peak of this on HDNET before it was released in theaters. I think the reason this film wasn't received well it that they marketed it as a horror movie.....which it is not! The film it about loss and coping with that loss and in the area of showing different types of grieving I do think this film succeeds. The acting is very good and I for one like the marriage here of drama and a little horror. I can say this much, this film has some good scares and they come because the film isn't focused on ""the ghost"". It's not a perfect film, but I think this one hasn't gotten the credit it deserves."
5,Excellent college basketball book,"This book is a very good history book about the NCAA Tournament, and men's college basketball in general. The author included some info. about the regular season for the teams involved in that year's tournament. It covers the 1st NCAA tournament in 1939 through 1982. The author goes into at least a little detail about every game in each year's tournament, which I thought was amazing. I've never seen that before in any other book. The only drawback is that the early '80s is really when the tournament really began to ""take off"" and have more and more exciting games through the rest of the '80s and throughout the '90s in particular. Does anyone know of a more updated version of this kind of book?Rhett G."
5,"Far and away, the best way to prepare for the LSAT","There is no substitute for taking real, timed, practice LSATs. It is simply the best way to prepare for the real thing. My study plan was two part: First, I paid the big bucks for an LSAT class. Second, I studied real tests every day out of this and its companion book. While the class was great, I found that simply studing all of the material on the real test was by far the most useful thing I did (not to mention that it cost a lot less). These books are simply a must have to prepare well and I recomend them to everyone. In my case, they helped me score in the mid 170s."
3,"Helpful, but older LSATS","Good book, and a good resource for extra practice. However, the tests are ten years old and a newer version of this book may be helpful as well."
4,Thought provoking stories,This anthology includes 15 stories about pets from other worlds. Like most anthologies there are strong stories and several weak ones. Several of the stories are very good and quite moving.
4,Highlander from the past,Was great! Didn't think I would like it till I really got to reading it. Kind of long and slow in parts but you will keep reading it just to see how it ends. Got all her books after reading this one.
3,Romance Comes in 3's,"This is a great series of books and a great author. This is the first book in the series and it has a lot of adventure and you never know what's coming next. I found it hard to put down and finished the book rather quickly. You'll have to read the next two for the rest of the ""Highlander Men""."
4,College Art History,"This book has wonderful pictures and gives an excellent overview from ancient to post modernism art. The descriptions are pretty brief though, and do not go into great detail on any particular artist. However, it's an excellent book to get a general idea of the evolution of western art. The book covers significant art movements, and some minor ones as well."
4,Enjoyable,"Really enjoy the sounds, wanted to experience a different type of music. For a change of pace, especially while working, I would recommend this to anyone."
4,Badly Drawn Boy - we hardly know you,"I stumbled upon Hour of the Bewilderbeast at the library of all places, and then noticed The Shining on a bunch of chillout cds I already owned. Hour... was on continuous rotation in my player for a few weeks. I was pleased when One Plus One came out, and ran out to buy it. It does not disappoint. Fans will appreciate it, and I dare say, this album will attract new fans. But not by being played on the radio or hearing it at a club. This is an album that friends give or recommend to each other.Final note: Badly Drawn Boy reminds me of Sparklehorse in a way - an intensely private music. Perfect for headphone listening."
4,Like a fine wine...,"Being a huge BDB fan, I really wanted to love this CD. He's extremely talented and refreshing compared to a lot of the junk out there.Having listened to it many times through, I have decided this CD gets better with time. My first listen to One Plus One is One left me feeling dissapointed. I didn't like the direction he went in, and I felt like he was trying too hard after getting so much criticism with Have You Fed the Fish.I gave the CD a rest, but then one day I felt like giving it another try. To my suprise, some of the songs I originally didn't care for, I started to like. As I kept listening to it, I really began to enjoy it.Something tells me this CD will be on the extremes--Either you love it or hate it--Don't be too quick to dismiss this CD, though...give it some time. You just may end up really liking it!"
5,Woodpecker Seed cake,"This is a great sized cake and lasts a long time. It's got a lot of seeds, nuts and fruit in it. The birds love it and I've been buying it routinely since spring. Size is about 8 inches long by 5 inches wide by 3 inches deep."
4,A great album,"I love this album, but the recordign is a little bad. On my computer it sounds funny along with my car sterio. But other than that the songs and as always her voice is beautiful."
5,Live in Paris & Toronto,"I really enjoy her music, but I have never enjoyed it more than with the live concert she gives. The cd came in excellent condition and it shipped fast. Thanks"
4,Lorena McKennitt,"I Originally owned this cd over 7 yrears ago and in moving lost it. I was thrilled to find it again. It is a great blend of new age, celtic and cross cultural music. One of my all time favorites is The Highwayman based on the Noyes poem that I learned in grade school. It just resounds in my mind and brings the poem to a beautiful musical life. This cd is a keeper"
4,"Short, but funny it's Cinerella with a twist","I really liked the twist in this book because, I think, there are too many Cinderella stories now days. To give the book a twist made it more interesting, not to mention more fun, to read. You couldn't predict as much. Even more than the twist was the humor. When Cinderellis couldn't take his helmet off to know what the princess was saying I laughed really hard. The only thing I didn't like about this book was how short it was. Levine could have gone on another ten chapters, yet she didn't."
3,Qualified usefulness for medical transcription,"I had this book recommended to me as a transcription terminology aid. It is very limited in that function. It is obviously a very good book for those who will be performing tests, but not as much so for those of us transcribing the results. It is useful for providing context to help you infer what type of test or range of results you may be listening for, but you will need a book specifically for terminology once you have narrowed it down."
5,Book order,The book I ordered arrived within the given date stated and was in excellent condition. I would purchase books from this seller again. Thanks!
2,Not for the serious musician,"I bought this sight unseen for one of my graduating HS seniors who constantly had to be reminded to look up the musical terminology in the pieces he studied--sort of a spoof gift. Spoof better describes this 'dictionary'. While it has a number of interesting things in it, for the serious music student, it will be of little use beyond the very common and obvious. Certainly not of sufficient quality for the average high school student let alone a serious one. I cannot recommend this book and certainly will never purchase another copy. Back to the language dictionaries!"
2,quick read,Quite a pat mediocre product...felt like a made-for-TV movie. The opening scene is the only one with real guts and power.
5,triple witch,"I could relate to the main charater for several reasons. Being a transplant to Maine and living in a house 109 years old, I can relate to the main charater. I have also visited Eastport and the author's description is perfect of the region and people. Small towns like Eastport are the perfect settings for outsiders to get lost in and commit crimes. Mrs. Graves does not use native Maine pronouncement of words that confuses the reader and mocks residents.The book moves at a pace fast enough to keep the reader interested, yet slow enough to not overlook too many details. True, I was able to solve the mystery before the story was completed; however, you cannot anticipate the ending. It is not one of those books that gives you too many suspects and too little information. It also doesn't sidetrack the reader with long passionate love scenes. I have read all three of Mrs. Graves novels and am awaiting the release of her next book in August, 2001."
5,The BEST moderately-priced lip stain!,"Truly, for the money, you cannot do better than Revlon's ""Just Bitten"" Lip Stain! Don't go by the horrible and inaccurate color samples that are supposed to represent the shades. The Plum Wicked is a wonderful blackberry shade that can be worn light, for a soft plum rose shade, or applied more heavily for a romantic, goth look. Blood Orange is pure MAGIC ... warm sweet coral if you use just a bit, or apply two or three coats for a deeper, more dramatic persimmon shade that's gorgeous and wild. And I've never ever rolled it right onto my lips -- I use a lip brush to pick up the color from the rollerball and apply it for an even coat. Use it over a wee bit of buttery lip balm (not over a waxy one!). It takes instants to dry, so you can apply another coat or more within a minute or so. These lip stains last very nicely indeed. Highly recommended!!"
2,I won't bother again,Was rather expensive - I have some Avon mark KissInk and like it much better. It goes on easier and stays where you put it.The Revlon Just Bitten Stain is like water and hard to control - also it tastes awful! The Avon stuff does not have a taste.
1,I don't understand,"Was this even a movie that I watched? There is absolutely no gore, no script to think of, and no acting ability documented on this 82 minutes waste of my life. The film is extremely low-budget, and the only reason that they couldn't get an MPAA rating is that the filmmakers probably couldn't afford a stamp anyway.The plot has something to do with getting $2000, drugs, amnesia, drugs, and more drugs. I think there might have even been a scene where drugs were not the major plot-point, but I can't even recall a scene with a plot at all for that matter. A big bowl of dumb that camp fans can't even laugh at, you'll just feel sorry for these guys."
4,For the basics,Possibly not for those who fully know classics like myself but I enjoy it while working to take the edge off. Also good background sounds to enjoy while reading.
5,Doctor Who: the complete specials,"The end of David Tennant and the beginning of Matt Smith... you can't go wrong with these DVD's. Any and all Whovians will love this. Buy some tissue too, guys, you're going to cry your eyes out."
4,Love the HD; could use more extras,"These stories provided a generally good send-off to David Tennant's Doctor. The first two stories were a little weaker, but still entertaining. ""Waters of Mars"" was one of the scariest and best ""Doctor Who"" stories written by Russel T. Davies, in the same league as ""Midnight"". The first part of ""The End of Time"" was a bit slow, while part 2 was quite engaging.One really enjoyable thing about the Blu Ray format is being able to see ""Doctor Who"" in HD for the first time. Quite a change from the cheap cheesiness of the '70's Tom Baker episodes that first got me to love the show. My one complaint about the Blu Ray set is that it is a bit light on extra features compared with the DVD sets for Series 1-4."
3,Not good for a family,"This silverware set would be perfect for a one or two person home because you probably don't need many more utensils. However for a family of three or more this set is just too small! We go through the silverware a lot faster than I run the dishwasher. The slots for each kind of silverware is not large enough to hold more than eight pieces each, so we have to have two different sets. Great silverware...but the holder is much to be desired."
5,A happy customer,"I originally thought there were only music videos to the songs on the ""The Prodigy: Their Law"" CD but was pleasently surprised to see live performances at Brixton Academy and ofcourse the making of videos like firestarter.I really liked it and would recommend it to anyone."
1,Cannot recommend ....,"I bought my daughter a Leapster LMAX for her birthday last year and it worked perfectly, until I decided to buy the recharger! I charged the LMAX on it and then when my daughter tried to play it the LMAX began smoking and it completely fried!! I followed the instructions to the letter and yet this happened. I was so upset (as was my daughter!) and, thankfully, when I called LeapFrog they were absolutely wonderful about it and replaced it with no fuss. What a relief!Anyway, I have found that the batteries actually last for quite a while., much longer than I had expected based on past reviews that I had read of what to expect. Recently I did buy the $10 plug in accessory so that when we are home the kids can play it without using batteries. So, while I highly recommend the LMAX, I strongly caution anybody who is thinking about buying the recharging system based on my personal experience."
4,GREAT WATCH!,I've had my eco-drive for about a month now and I can really say I am very much satisfied with my purchase.I also have hairy arms but I have not had any problems at all having my hairs caught in the watch band.Only things I wish it had would be a Day feature and a perpetual calendar. Other than that is perfect!
2,Perfect Time Piece - Gone Bad,"This is my original review:--------This is a quality watch that is much like the Citizen watch I wore with great satisfaction for 20 years. Then, 20 years ago, I thought I should have a digital watch. Not soon after, I returned to analog but it has taken until now for me to find this Citizen. It is simple, yet handsome. It is basic with just a touch of elegance. I don't think you can find better at any price. It's great to be home.This is an amendment to my former review added 5/7/2012:-------------- I began to have trouble with the stem getting caught on clothing and shutting down the watch. When discovered, I would push in the pin and it would restart after resetting. Then the pin caught and broke off. I had to replace the watch."
5,Bully lock for Dodge,"This was easy to install, looks like it was OEM and has been working great for a long time for me.Installed on a 2007 Dodge 3500."
3,GOOD FOR THE PRICE,"GOOD FOR THE PRICE U ARE PAYING , BUT IS VERY CHEAP MAKE , THE KEY IS VERY VERY VERY SOFT MATERIAL ...EASY TO INSTALL"
3,"Good product, faulty bolt","Easy to install but one of the bolts broke in two when being hand tighten. Before wasting time sending it back I tried a little JB Weld and it held. Looks good on the truck, would of given it a 5 star except for he bolt. Maybe I just had a defective bolt."
4,works well,"It works well. where it mounts it is plastic, so if you over tighten it, it can break the retaining screws out."
1,Just plain bad...,"This video was a waste of time and money. It's amazing how adults, including the guys in this DVD, can still be stuck in a pre-adolescent mind frame. Jackass and other skater/prank-stuntmen and shows all seem to have appeal in the lowest level of entertainment. Acting like an absolute moron for cheap thrills and attention is funny when you're a kid or early teenager but it can't be right for twenty or thirty something to make a career out of it. It is especially wrong when it threatens your life, health and dignity for money.This show influences kids much more to do stupid harmful things then what parents thought heavy metal or rap music used to do.These guys also give a bad name for skateboarding, as if it hasn't been affected enough by hip hop influence and brand clothing styles.The shows might have been slightly amusing when they first came because of the shock and awe but it's gets old fast.It's good that these shows are fading and aren't as popular as they were some years ago."
5,Examinations of UFO reports,First they discuss the government Blue Book project which showed that 95-99% of sightings could be explained by natural sources leaving 1-5% as unexplained. Then they go through the physical properities of planets and galaxies that are required for life and deduce that there is a chance of 1e-200 that any other planet in the galaxy could support life. Then they go through the problems of deep space travel such as lifetimes of the beings and cosmic rays damaging them. This leaves special relativity which shows that there are several space and time dimensions that humans do not occupy. The visitors could occupy these. Then they go over the history of human contact with these creatures and find that the creatures always tell scientific falsehoods and cause physical and mental harm to the humans. The conclusion is that these creatures are not to be trusted and you would be well off avoiding them.
3,Lights in the Sky and Little Green Men,"If you are looking for a good book this one is ok, but It does get into to much science mumbo jumbo. If you are looking for more of a book with fortean and sightings this is not the book you want. However the book is well written."
