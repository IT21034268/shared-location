1,Awful.,"This is one really awful CD. I can't really stand Kidz Bop, but I wouldn't even think of buying this trash. I've just heard some of the songs. There IS going to be a Kidz Bop 9, and it's probably going to be just as rubbish as this is. What's going to be on volume 9 then?Another U2 song being runied? Yet ANOTHER Nickleback song totally not meant for kids? Another Kelly Clarkson song which will end up being buchered? I dread to think. And I don't want to listen to any of them either. So I'm not going to listen to these ones this time. I've had enough. Don't buy ANY of the Kidz Bop CDs.What's happened to this world? Will the dreadful sound and music of Kidz Bop ever end?"
1,Please note: The one star I gave this came from my arse.,"I reviewed this album by listening to the samples. After the third ""song"" I had to stop as my ears were melting off my skull, and my internal organs haemorrhaging. Ahh, this must be the music they use to extract information from Guantanamo Bay detainees, cleverly disguised as a Kidz Bop album."
1,WHY ISN'T THERE A ZERO STAR OPTION??,"Ok, I haven't bought this album, but I have seen commercials and I know this is crap. This cd is trashing tons of my favorite songs, they SUCK!! Little five year old kids shouldn't be singing these songs....if your kid likes ""True"" go buy your kid Ryan Cabrera's album. If your kid likes ""Rich Girl"" go buy them Gwen Stefani's album. I mean really, you are out of your mind to buy this!"
1,I would give it negitive 5 stars but...,"OMG i got the second one for my b-day and HATED it, really if ur going to buy a kid something don't give em a copy of good songs done by some kids who wanna be pop stars and REALLY can't sing cause they r only probaly embaresing themselvs for $.If you get it and ur kids love it ur going 2 b srry cause it is HORRIBLE! I hate it my cousins friends family and everyone else i don't feel like saying HATE it. PLEASE DON""T WASTE YOUR MONEY FOR THIS IT IS NOT A GOOD PRESENT AT ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Very Crappy!,"The Kidz Bop music CD`s are the worse thing that hit the music stores besides Worship Jamz. And about the kid-friendly songs Lonley No More, Obsession, Rich Girl, Let Me Love You, and other songs are NOT kid-friendly! And I should know because I`m a pre-teen myself and hear most of these songs on Kiss FM and other radio stations that most of the kids at my school listen to. Plus, this is just rushing kids Seriously! In a second a 7-8 year old will go from Barbies and Hot Wheels to strolling down the street in high-heals and a handbag. These crappy CD`s are just giving kids a bad name for singing, just because there`s some stupid CD that claims that their the best thing in the Country. If you want to hear the REAL song buy THIER CD instead of this crappy one."
1,TOTAL!!!!!! GARBAGE!!!!!!!! PEOPLES!!!!,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THIS MAKES ME WANT TO BURF!!! I MEAN COME ON!!! IT SOUNDS LIKE A MO0SE GIVING BIRTH TO AN ELELPHANT.OR CHIMPMUNKS HOWLING.THERE PUNY little VOICES MAKES ME WANT TO PUKE.KIDS POP WILL NEVER GIVE UP.IT SOUNDS LIKE CRAP.DONT BUY THIS PERIOD.
1,I JUST WANNA PUKE ALL OVER THE STEREO.,"OH MY GOD! I LOVE KIDZ BOP! IT'S SOOOO COOL! All the kids sining, That's just so cute! And even the Adults have good voices!PSYCHE!Haahahahahahahahah Sarcasm? [...] RIGHT IT IS! This CD is complete TURD. REAL TURD! I'd rather have rusted nails hammered in my eardrums.PS: To those parents who go, ""Oh, I'm a parent whose real stupid and my kids love this!""... GET YOUR KIDS SOME REAL MUSIC! If your kid likes ""Vertigo"" by U2 (which is a great song) GET YOUR KIDS SOME REAL MUSIC. These ""Kidz"" are real untalented."
1,The Bard would be turning in his grave!,"Mel Gibson's unworthy portrayal of the Prince of Denmark can only be worsened by noting the fact that he broke the iambic pentameter of ""Yea, from the table of my memory, I'll wipe away all trivial fond records...."" Something is indeed rotten in Denmark! The rest is silence."
4,Very Good,"Mel Gibson gives a memorable performance as the young prince of Denmark. The movie cut out too much from the original play. It was very different from the Branaugh version of the play. They added some scenes and some lines that I liked. I highly recommend this movie to any Mel Gibson, Historical, or Tradgety film fans."
3,Good Hollywood Shakespeare...,"Let me explain my rating: 5 stars for drama and cast, 1 star for historical authenticity...avg: 3 stars.You'll have to understand that this Hamlet has been liberally snipped to fit into two hours or so (135min). There can be no doubt that this version is a compromise in many ways, but it is a good one, in my view. The more recent Kenneth Brannagh version is more historically true to the bards work, but Mel's version is one for today's (young) audiences. No tiresome strutting or preening here, just good ol' tragedy. I liked it. (Alas poor Yorrick, his scene got cut.)"
1,Not this time Mel!,"Well...if you want a chop job Hamlet this is the version to go for. Kenneth Branagh's version does a wonderful disgrace to this movie! I don't care wether Mel Gibson is good looking or not; he is not fit for the Shakesperean Stage/Screen. The only thing this movie is good for is high school students who didn't read the play and want to get the basic story. My friend and I laughed the whole way through and the only reason we survived is because it was happy hour at the campus bar. The script is wanting in every way possible and Glenn Close as Gertrude? Pass me another beer and you, well you should move on and see Branagh or Olivier's Hamlet!"
3,Icky,"Hamlet is the ultimate revenge drama, but doesn't anyone else get tired of watching Mel Gibson doing his tired old man-loses-his-mind-and-takes-revenge-for-a-wrong character? It's no surprise that he would play Hamlet. He's been playing Hamlet in just about every movie he's ever made.I gave it three stars on the strength of Helena Bonham Carter's Ophelia, but I would be a shame if anyone watched this thinking it was a valid representation of Shakespeare's finest work. As an introduction, it may work, but only as an introduction. The play has so much more depth than this version indicates. Watch it in addition to reading the text and watching a live performance and even Branagh's film. (And keep in mind that Hamelt would have been in his early twenties--Gibson could be his DAD, and Branagh is too old also.)"
1,Laughable,"Mad Max as the most classically tragic figure of all-time - what a joke! Glenn Close is abominable and hardly old enough to be his mother - plus Gibson's too old to play the young prince, anyway.I love Shakespeare, but this was atrocious. Laurence Olivier would be turning over in his grave if he saw this despicable display of an acting attempt by Gibson. Watch Olivier or Branagh's versions if you desire true Shakespeare- not the faux watered-down version. He was great in Braveheart - but ladies and gents, Braveheart this is not."
2,It was wasteful of words.,This movie could have gotten to the point faster if it had been more concise. It was also hard to follow because of the language. It also would have been nearly impossible to understand if the play had not been read first. The acting was good because each actor accurately portrayed the characters as Shakespeare had described them.
4,Pretty good . . .,"I have to say, having rewatched both this and Branagh's Hamlet for a class I was teaching that this is a really good version. Then again, it is directed by Zefrelli and has Glen Close, Alan Bates, and Helena Bonham Carter, who was born to play Ophelia. Even Mel does not disgrace himself in this version and he gets better as the movie goes on. Surround yourself with good actors and you will often rise to the occasion!"
1,Hyperventilate,"This movie is a very poor production but also a curious one because the only good thing about it is the monster itself. Hypnogogic and psychopompic hallucinations (the correct terms) are an ancient problem of mankind. This film pretends to be fact based yet it does not mention the only known cure for sleep paralysis: hyperventilation which floods the body with oxygen to wake up the brain, since sleep paralysis is caused by one part of the brain being awake while another is asleep. That said, this topic has great potential and some producer should make a film of gripping horror (I suggest this film's producer find a new line of work). Readers who wish more information on this topic would do well to read ""Night of the Crusher: The waking nightmare of sleep paralysis propels people into a spirit world"" by Bruce Bower on Science News Online server."
4,Just when you thought it was safe to sleep...,... it isn't!A 'must-see' for the unlucky who've experienced the horror of sleep-paralysis - and a 'dare-to' for the lucky who haven't... pray it doesn't visit you...An effective shocker with an overwhelming sense of suffocation... kiss your sweet dreams goodnight.
5,Absolutely top notch memoir,"It's every bit as good as the other reviewers indicate. I have the older edition. The new reprint offers more material and I would reccomend it. What I like about Clostermann's story is his combat in the aftermath of D Day and the winter of '44-'45. His D Day entries are in direct contrast to every aviation history you've read which will tell you the Luftwaffe was non existent during the August and September ground action. When he gets his canopy blown out by a FW190 cannon shell at 7,000 feet or so in a swirling twisting dogfight, it takes your breath right out of you. He tells you how his feet slip on the rudder bar because he's sweating so much with fear. He describes what it's like to hunt Me 262's that are returning to their base in dirty weather, nearly invisible in the dusk twilight. And you get the unvarnished anguish/relief he feels at the end of the war when the RAF summarily dismisses him from service.It doesn't get any better than this. Read it!"
2,Watch Looker!,"Richard Gere and Julia Roberts are once again. Gere plays a newspaper reporter doing a story on a woman (Roberts) getting or trying to marry for the forth time. This movie is great for a laugh or two, but it's a movie you keep looking at your watch during."
2,And this was the better Julia Robert movie in 99,"How many times is Julia Robert going to play the Pretty, Misunderstood woman who finally falls for the right guy.In this case Mr. Right is Richard Gere, who is pratrically a misogynyst at the beginning of the movie.Obviously the casting was supposed to remind us of Pretty Woman, but seriously how many times can you hope to redo _Pygmallian_ in a modern setting, with the same actors?The movie is not without charm, or funny moments, but this is one of the movies that I own that I wonder why I bought."
2,"Average Romantic-Comedy, Nothing new.","This movie is only kept afloat by it's two stars. If you like Julia Roberts and Romantic-Comedys I recommend you see 'Pretty Woman' or 'Notting Hill', both much better films. It goes on a little long, rent it first."
2,Bad 5.1 Sound Track,"The Dolby Digital 5.1 sound track sounds more like a 5.0 sound track: no audible LFE. The ProLogic track seems to be okay. Seeing as though I (as well as others) spent a fortune on digital sound with speakers, sub, etc. it seems a shame to have that low quality of a sound track on a recent dvd."
4,romance,i bought this dvd because i knew one of the cast and that was a first for me. it is not as good a pretty woman. but likeable.
3,"Good movie, if you like typical fare","While it's true I watch this movie many times, I don't know if it's particularly the kind of movie everyone would enjoy. It runs the formula too well, and so you definately feel like you've seen it before. I suggest you read the synopsis of Amazon.com's reviewer, and if you still want to buy it, go ahead. But don't expect anything particularly original or ingenius. (I particularly had a hard time finding the ending as particularly credible. But the romantic in me still enjoys it)."
3,Entertaining,"This is a good chic flick, that you do not mind watching with your significant other. They do not capture all the essence that occurred in there first film portrayed. But there is still chemistry on screen. Joan Cussac steals her scenes. Parts of the ""Lady in Red"" supporting staff are in this fill. You can tell they wanted us to feel that this was the same type of draw emotionally as ""Lady in Red'/ Though Marshall did a good job directing. Overall the movie is fun, entertaining and has a good soundtrack."
1,Horrible,"I watched this movie with my wife unfortunately. Unfortunate that I watched this movie, not that I viewed it with my wife. The movie was so bad that we left 3/4 into it. It was so bad that even my wife agreed it was horrible and she left with me. Julia Roberts while having a good smile is not the best of actresses. Case in point is Ocean's Eleven."
1,Unbelievably bad.,"If you are allergic to movies that have an overkill of ""cuteness,"" be sure to have a barfbag handy, when you watch this one. Luckily, I recorded it from TV, skimmed to the end just to make sure it did have the required happy ending, and then erased it. If I had actually owned it, I would have burned it."
1,"""Runaway from this""","This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen.The small town America this piful is set in has to be the most sickingly false contrived piece of garbage Hollywood has come up with to date.Richard Gere is particurally wooden and miscast,Julia Roberts on the other hand has been playing the same character since Pretty Woman, so no surprises from her.By the way,the Dixie Chicks video on the DVD is worse thn the film.I gave the one star for the lack of special features on this DVD as there is less of this garbage to watch."
2,Too much.,"First off, let me say I am a Kiki fan. I loved "" I Owe You"". I was really looking forward to hearing her latest album. To my surprise, it wasn't what I expected. It was too contemporary. It was just a lot of beats, with her trying to sing over them. I tried to listen to it. I found myself skipping from track to track. With ""I Owe You"", she use different styles of music, which made the album great. With this album she headed in a different direction, and stayed with one style of music. It just didn't sound right. The only two songs I like are "" Hear This"", and "" Why Me"". I think I'll stick with ""I Owe You"", and pray that her next album is more like her first album. God bless."
2,Most overated book ever,"I was so dissapointed after reading this book. I read every single part word for word and did not learn anything. At the same time, I could not put it down. I guess thats the story of my life. And what was that stuff about chickens all about."
2,Not helpful,"Wish I had not bought this book; didn't have recipes my family enjoys, and no pictures. Normally we cook tacos, hamburger helper, pastas, etc. I was looking for easy and heathly recipes to replace these, but I wasn't impressed with this book."
5,Say Sayonara Stinky!!!,"I'd been trying to find a non chemical laden deodorant for a couple years, all the tom's irritated my skin, the mineral deodorants did too. I tried this one because of the good reviews. It works great, no B.O. even after working all day outside in 90 degrees. I don't like the way it goes on, it doesn't go on as smooth as I'd like, but other than that it's great."
4,For a shiba,"4 out of 5 because it didn't come with safety collar. Works great and no problems, makes it easy to walk the dog."
4,A nice lens for the money,"This is not the fanciest piece of equipment in the world, but we've gotten some great shots with it. Well worth the money in my opinion."
4,"Great Music, Fine Memories,","Greetings: This was my very first DVD of the Strawbs, and I'm so glad that I was able to secure it for a reasonable price on Amazon. I have 21 cd's of the group and am especially fond of the early stuff(60's & 70's) I appreciate the fact that I ""found"" Sandy Denny through them. It is a great testimony to folk music in general and specifically this group has had such a long and successful following, dedicated fans. I heartily recommend it to all who truly enjoy spirit, music, folk, history, mystery, and life.Bill Michau"
1,Not what I expected,I was expecting solid sturdy plastic animals but these are not them. My daughter received them for her second birthday off her amazon wishlist. Now what we have them I wish I had never put them on there. They are hollow plastic and all of the large animals have rings around their necks where two pieces were put together. The quality of the rings varies wildly. On the pig it is barely noticeable yet the head of the goat is attached very poorly. If this had not been a gift I would be returning it.
3,Poor quality for the price,"I agree with the other reviewers who have said the quality of the animals is quite poor given the price! My 2 yo thinks they're great, though, which is why I gave this set 3 stars overall. When I looked at similar German-designed animal sets which sell for about the same cost I was very disappointed with this set -- the paint job is poor, the seams where the heads connect to the body are prominent. Just poorly made!"
3,I AM WHAT I AM,"Despite paying extra money for expedited shipping, CD arrive almost a week later than date promised."
5,Excellent Movie,"Jacob's Ladder has to be one of the best psychological thrillers I've seen. If you think about everything in the movie and remember it, the whole nitemare starts to make sense. Watch it twice... you'll see the whole picture."
5,Dropping The Bags,"After a many viewings of this unusual work, there are still subtleties to be found. Unrelenting metaphor that is transparent until review of where it has taken the viewer. Shocking in parts, confusing and disturbing, there are at least three levels to be understood; all with difficulty, but thought provoking to say the least. Could not help but buy a copy finally to make sure it was within reach as memory of it prevailed."
1,not worth watcing,"it did not make any sense to me, if he was dead than he should be seening worse things than people walking around and if he was a wake than he shouldn't be dearming at all, one of the worse movies i've seen in a long time"
2,A Complete Waste of Time,A 2 star rating for this movie is quite generous. This 1969 production is passé. It is long and boring. I sat for 2 hours waiting for the movie to take some sort of direction. It lead nowhere. Don't waste your time and money renting this poor excuse for a film let alone buying it. DVD picture quality was sub par as well.
5,Jacob's Ladder,It was a great blu-ray edition. It was well done and I liked the extra scenes and commentary. It was a great buuand I am happy to add it to my collection.
5,Life is a hard habit,"This is one of several movies which deal with the attatchments of life as reviewed through deathbed scenarios.Some others are ""The Jacket"", ""Butterfly Effect"", to some extent ""The Machinist"" and even ""Donny Darko"" all films in which you never cease to find new interpretations with repeated viewings. These films are learning experiences and this is one of the better ones."
5,great kids' helmet,"my son just turned five and i wanted a helmet for him to go along with the dirt-bike styled bicycle i bought for his birthday. i looked everywhere for the full-face helmet but could only find it for children 8 and up, so finding this helmet for someone his size was great! the price was excellent and not only does it protect his whole face, but he thinks it's cool, too!"
2,"Unrealistic, scary","With its unrealistic ""cure"" for autism, this movie can be harmful to millions of parents and loved ones of children with autism."
5,great laughs,I just recently bought this video from a blockbuster video in canada and it is awesome. Very good video!
3,"They work, but visibility claims are exaggerated","First of all, I like these. They flash when the power goes too low on the fence. If its flashing, you have a problem.HOWEVER, they claim they can be seen a mile away! Err, no way, not unless its pitch dark and you have field glasses or are using the rifle scope.Realistically, these can be seen about 100 feet in day light (viewed almost face on, as they have a lens that focuses the light in to a small beam), and 200 feet at night (again viewed directly).This will affect how many you really need, and were you put them.We have two and both work the same - even with fresh batteries."
3,"ok, but not","purchased these to help with tightening of muscles as claimed. Don't see any difference, at least not yet"
1,Just another insole,"This is just another cushioned insole for your shoes. It is no better than those found in pharmacies and theirs is half the price of the ""Smartsole""."
1,Not even close to comfortable,"These insoles didn't fit into any of my shoes very well. I figured they would have best chance of fitting in my Nikes, I removed the insole from my shoes, put these in, and couldn't even make it out the front door they were so uncomfortable. The plastic on the bottom is very hard and hurt part of my foot since it wouldn't lay right in my shoes. I definitely would not recommend these."
2,Nothing Special,"Not ""negative heel technology"" as stated in the original description - which has now changed - these are way over-priced & provide nothing more than a little extra cushioning."
2,Smartsole Anti-Cellulite Insoles,"I could not use these, walking in them was fine but the next day my back would hurt so bad! Sent them back."
5,It's a cable adapter. It works. It was cheap.,"There's not a lot to say. It arrived quickly, and it works the way it's supposed to. What else is there?"
3,Works as advertiszed,Works like you would expect. Changes the gender of the cable so you can continue to extend it.
5,Power Of Goodbye: one of Madge's best ballads???,"The answer to that is YES. The song is beautiful!1. ALBUM- Great song, as said above2. DALLAS LOW END- Good acoustic version3. SUPER LUPER- Good music, no vocals which makes this mediocre4. FILTERED- Better than Luke Slater Super Luper, scary sounds!5. FABIEN GOOD GOD- As it says, GOOD.A rather good single. Super Luper should be rid of though. Another remix should replace it. Maybe a remix of one of her previous singles from the ROL album???"
3,Luke shouldnt quit his day job!,I am really shocked and disappointed at this CD. I loved the original song from Ray of Light..I loved the remixes from the other songs from the album..BUT...I hated the Luke Slater remixes..I agree with one of the other reviewers...Freedom Comes..can only come so many times!..the only decent mixes are the Dallas Austin and the Fabian Mix...I wish Victor or William could have remixed it or even Groove Armada..it would have been blastin'then!!! 1 star for the mixes and 2for Maddie and her song!
1,the worse Madonna remix ever!!!,"this is such a beautiful song, but remix ...major puke! i have no idea how they approved all these mixes. buy the junior vasquez version."
5,Looks great on my counter!,"Love this towel holder, and the way the top releases so you can easily insert your paper towels. I bought this from Warehouse Deals, and it came in like new condition, and looks great on my counter. I've had it for several months, and it is holding up very well. Would purchase again!"
5,terminator forever,"i loved terminator 2. The only problem I had was the language, to much. I just love the story, specially the relationship between the terminator and the boy. It made me cry when he had to say goodbye and then they embrace. I mean look at that. Like, Sarah said, ""If a machine can learn the value of human life, maybe we can too"". 5-stars. The cast is great. Good job, James Cameron."
5,What happened to DVS?,"The previous DVD version of T2 had ""English (Descriptive Video Service)"" as one of the audio tracks. This new one doesn't.I realize it was intended for blind and visually impaired people, but I liked listening to someone describe the non-verbal action of the film. Since I'd already seen the movie many times, it allowed me to walk around my house, doing other things while I ""watched"" the movie. Since the track was included in the previous disk, I kind of wonder why they didn't keep it.I'm thinking about ""upgrading"" my T2 DVD to this new version. I was going to either sell or give away the one I have now, but I would miss the DVS track. I really want all the new extras, but do I really need two?Movie - 5 stars (Missing DVS - 0 stars)"
1,This looks like a huge ripoff,"Has any body else noticed that the only thing new in this collectors set is the skynet edition and the endoskull. The extreme and ultimate editions seem to be on regular dvd, I would guess a lot of us already own them. While it would be cool to have the skull, I just can't see spending all that money."
2,DVD or Blu ray whats the deference,"Unfortunately I couldn't tell the deference of picture quality between DVD version and Blu ray version. Also when I pause them and come back, it won't remember where it was, because it keeps trying to launch skynet app."
2,Not so HD,"The movie is simply a classic, and a must for any Sci-fi fan.The HD quality was less then good though. I probably did something wrong, but I never really got it to work in a anything that even resembled Hi Definition af 720 or 1080."
5,WOW,"There is just so much stuff on this DVD is not to be missed. I havwe never seen a DVD with this much stuff on it, it's so worth the price. I even heard that there is a third edition of T2 on this disc with 5 extra never before seen footage. If anyone knows where it is please say.. once again INCREDIBLE"
5,Wow!,"Exceptional conveyance of detail along with some of the more amazing special effects you'll ever see on the screen. Another gem by the greatest action film director of our generation, James Cameron."
2,WMV HD licensing rights suck,"I specifically bought this special edition to play the WMV HD version through my PC. Unfortunately the software is buggy, and caused major problems. After hours of fiddling, downloading patches etc. I find out that you can ONLY play the software if you live in the US or Canada ( i live in Aus ) . Very dissapointed. If you are buying this for the HD content be careful, and search on the web for some more information before you buy it."
2,EXTREME Garbage,"Okay...I love T2...Five stars on the film. I crave the special edition cut...even better than the theatrical.BUT HELL PEOPLE! With 3 different DVD versions of the film, which do you buy??Sure as you can guess, don't buy the single DVD edition. But don't you dare buy the EXTREME DVD version Artisan pushed out. What crap. Seriously. Special features are the commentary, a lameo interactive piece that plays a long with the film, 2 short documentaries, and a trailer for the better, ULTIMATE EDITION. Oh yeah...and if you like to watch movies on the computer, you can watch the theatrical version on WINDOWS MEDIA PLAYER.Seriously...where do people get off packaging a DVD like this? The special features are sorely lacking here.Lastly...this lame metal case tears the spine of the DVD case to shreds. Piss poor, Artisan. Now I'm out to hunt for the Ultimate Edition."
3,High definition doesn't work in uk,"Just a note, good dvd, but the high definition media player part has an internet check to see what country you are in!You can't view the high definition part in the uk!"
4,Cmon' No better story than the Terminator. One thing though,"James Cameron has proven himself THE master of Sci-Fi....hands down. The music is AWSOME; get the soundtrack from both T1 and T2. But, why in the hell did they leave the extra scenes out on the DVD. I'm ticked. Fortunately, I bought the Special Edition VHS with the extra scenes when I went to Universal Studios, Florida. I'm just dissappointed to get the DVD without the extra scenes. I can't wait for The Abyss to come out on DVD."
4,SciFi Winner,This sequel to the original has an excellent continued plot. The acting is superb and the movie has continual action. It constantly keeps one on the edge of their seat! The only part of the script that leaves something else to be desired is the scene where Linda Hamilton goes into her own speech or tirade against the scientists and the destruction they have created vs the creation of a child by birth. On the whole - a great scifi film!
4,trouble playing the dvd on my pc,"I was really looking forward to watching this dvd, but when I popped it into my DVD-ROM drive, I got as far as selecting a chapter and then my dvd software failed. Neither PowerDVD nor the ATI player that came with my graphics card worked. Does anyone out there know of any software that plays this dvd? Please email me at bfift2girl@nyc.rr.com. Thanks in advance!"
5,Great Movie,"This morning for the first time in a long time I watched the first Terminator. I enjoyed it a lot. I even rated it my fav out of the first and second movie. Well Hubby and I just finished watching Terminator Judgment Day and I change my vote. This is my fav out of the two. I know this is bad, but I totally rout for the bad guy. He was so cool. The way he changed into people, the way he ran, the way he melted and then came back. I think he was really cool. I rate this movie number one. I'll be watch the next two Terminator movies in the next couple of days. I'm looking forward to it because I've never seen them before."
3,Nice follow up,"I enjoyed Terminator II, but to be honest, the first Terminator did more with less. Still, this is a sequel worth having. I bought this back when DVD players were relatively new and it was well-worth the oohs and ahhhs I got when showing it off to guests. That Arnold guy, I tell ya, if only we had a governor who could kick ass like this guy!"
2,Great Movie! Terrible transfer...,"I was really excited to get one of my favorite movies on Blu-ray, but unfortunately, the transfer is awful. I really couldn't tell a difference between this version and the DVD version I have!"
3,"Great skull, so so blue-ray","This review is for the Collectors set with skull. The skull is very solid, well made and will look great on your shelf. It comes with batteries and there's also a on/off switch underneath the base. The eyes light up and it plays sound effects from the movie. The sound is terrible though, it just sounds like static noise. The discs come in a separate case and you can also store them in the base of the skull. The blue-ray disc is a pain and wouldn't register my internet connection and takes forever to load. DTS and 5.1 sound wouldn't work on blue-ray for some reason. The sound on the DVD versions worked great so it must be a blue-ray defect. I'm pleased with the set except for the sound problems. If you're a fan this might be worth picking up but it's far from perfect."
5,The Epitome of Doomsday Science Fiction!,"Much the same as with the Aliens franchise, this sequel to the first film is the best of the bunch.Arnold's acting as well as Linda Hamilton's is great. That kid irritated the hell outta me but the movie as a whole is great.If you like action-packed movies, you'll not go away from this flick feeling cheated.A gotta have for the Sci Fi collector."
5,A MUST Have Film! Great in Blu-Ray High Def!!!,"This has always been a terrific film and a must have for any DVD collection. Considering it is not exactly a NEW film, it looks absolutely stunning in Blu-Ray High Def! I've never seen it look any better, and that includes watching it in the theatre when it originally showed.Somehow the film seems to really transfer itself to the home theatre experience well.I would have liked to see a few more extras on this, otherwise, a nice Blu-Ray title!"
2,Doesn't play on non-Profile 2.0 Blu-ray player,"I am a Blu-ray noob, but I could not get past the BD-Live features of this disc and watch the movie. It did play on another player, but it was slow, and the Skynet menus, etc., did not add anything worthwhile. I would avoid this version since Amazon does not allow returns if it doesn't work in your equipment. Get the non-Skynet version instead.I do give it 2 stars because it is still a great movie, but the picture quality, while better than DVD, is not up to newer HD releases if you have a screen capable of 1920 resolution."
3,ok,"Met my expectations, takes a little while to load, maybe it was my player. I'll keep both versions this one and the regular dvd."
1,Internet Connection Is Required to Play This Blu-Ray,"The Disk keeps saying a profile 2.0 blu-ray player with an internet connection is required to play this disk. I'm not connected, so I can't play it, total disaster!"
5,Even the menus are kewl,"All I can say is WOW. This is one of my all time favoriate films anyways. Add to this the the choice of which version to watch and all the wonderful extras...O, and the menus are way kewl also."
3,Blu Ray is disappointing,"Let me start this by saying Terminator 2 is one of my all time favorite movies. When I purchased a Blu Ray player, this was one of the first movies I picked up. Unfortunately there is not much difference between this and a regular DVD. It was so disappointing I nearly returned the Blu Ray player. After some research I found this was a poor example of Blu Ray.Unless they come up with a better quality transfer I would save my money and stick with the DVD - although at $[...] for the blu ray there is not much savings.I would suggest checking out this thread before purchasing blu ray movies.(...)"
3,good but not perfect,"DTS-HD MA sounds very good,but the definition is not perfect,it just looks like a dvd."
5,Better than ever!,"T2 Skynet Edition truly completes the movie experience of this classic film. This extended version pieces the movie together SO well, I am sorry I ever saw the original version. T2 has always been my favorite movie, but this Skynet version has taken it to a whole new level! I would recommend this to everyone!!"
1,Compatibility issue,"After receiving this blu-ray, I tried to play it on my Panasonic BD player. While loading a disc, a message is displayed ""Skynet has detected insufficient storage space. ....need 10,420KB at least... Retry/Cancel?"". Choosing Cancel make my BD player hangs.I also tried to play the disc with my Mitsubishi and Denon BD player. I have had a similar hang-up.On my PlayStation 3, I could play the movie. PS3 indicated ""DTS HD Master Audio..."" but it was played with ""Stereo"". What is ""Skynet Edition""?"
2,compatability issues,The picture and sound are great (as with all blu-ray I've purchased) but the stupid skynet menu system makes my HP laptop blu ray player very angry. I would recommend the non-skynet edition instead of this one for a T2 fan.
5,Terminator 2,Thank you for sending so promptly. This is one of my favorite movies of all time. It's hard to believe how long ago it was made!
3,Not as nice as it sounds.,Feel of product is cheap. Sound sucks. DVDs are great and you get every version.
5,Blu-ray best T2 transfer to date,"I don't understand why some people are saying this is a bad transfer, it is not. It is very sharp and colorful. Explosions are filled with great separation of color and no bleeding. I can only guess that the negative reviewers are not watching blu-ray titles on a proper HD monitor with 720p/1080i/1080p."
4,One Of James Cameron'e Best.,"This is one of the best action/science fiction films I have ever seen. One of James Cameron's best collaborators is Arnold Schwarzenegger and that is well proven here. This film is, in my opinion, light years better then the original Terminator in every aspect. Cameron is great at creating action films with elements of human drama. The ending is a bit cheesy and over the top but not enough to make this a bad film. The acting is pretty good. I'ld say the best performance is given by Linda Hamilton as the hardened and determined Sarah Connor. The music is okay. The special effects are terrific. The DVD is great and loaded to the gills with extras. I particularly like the ""making of"" documentary which includes interviews with Arnold, Cameron, and other cast and crew members. The documentary also shows the process behind the computer and make-up effects. The picture quality is fantastic. If you don't have this DVD, get it!"
5,"Terminator, T2, now T3:ROTM","All I can say is I am in love with this film! I kinda like this one better than the first but the first one is still a classic. Arnold did a perfect job as usual and Robert Patrick is the perfect T-1000. James Cameron's movies are always perfect. Now we have a new movie that's gonna be #1 in the box office. Terminator 3:Rise Of The Machines July 2,2003"
5,Terminator 2 Judgement Day,"Bought the Skynet Edition in BluRay. This is just the best Arnold action film ever made. That's what it is, so what else is there to say?Terminator 2: Judgment Day"
3,buy it if your a fan and have the money to throw away,Honestly I should have read the description. When I got it I was expecting a METAl endoskull not plastic. Nonetheless if you're a fan and collector and have the money to spare this is worth your consideration.
4,awsome movie bad player,this movie is awsome its high definition and has sorround sound and has everything a movie needs.the bad part is that you cant use a diferent player to watch it you need the interactual player and i have an nvidia purevideo decoder wich is awsome abut couldnt use it on the movie because purevideo cant use itbut apart from that its a great movie and amazon is the best online store its fast and reliable
3,Cheezy follow up to a dark classic,"They went into hyper drove with the sequel to the classic Terminator movie. Big effects, big story, big set pieces, big budget, big cheeze. This film loses the serious feel that made the first film so good. On its own it plays as a fun enough action flick. But the kids does ruin the film. Jason Patrick is excellent though, I must give him props."
1,Does NOT include theatrical release,"Despite the product description online AND as stated on the box cover, this dvd does NOT include the theatrical release. Only the extended director's cut is included."
3,"Great program, however","this is a great product, my kids (5 and 7) love it. They have learned a lot from it. All the positives and negatives about F and C from other reviews are spot on.The only thing I did not see anyone mention was the dialogue itself. I try to be careful with what my kids watch and I was a bit disappointed that this product uses ""stupid"" ""shut-up"" ""idiot"" all words I try to avoid. It is unnecessary and just frankly rude. Comments like these happen pretty frequently between the characters and I cringe every time I hear it. My kids have been told if they repeat what they hear, they cannot play the game anymore so it hasn't been a problem, but I thought I would at least warn parents of younger kids."
4,Happy Mom,"My children absolutely love this version. They wake at 5 a.m. to play before school. My son says ""it's great--I've learned lots of tips, and now I'm a much better chess player.""Why a 4-star and not 5? The down-side--the game doesn't allow the player to ""save"" at a certain level--totally frustrates the kids when they want to return, they have to start at the beginning again."
1,"Should be titled ""How to Stay Broke on Minimum Wage""","Mr.Steamer's suggestions imply that in order to become a millionare, one must be essentially perfect and alone- that is, having no health problems, minimal bills, no family, and find the cheapest place to live. I think it can be assumed that if one were to live alone and have perfect health in the cheapest city in the world and not spend their money on frivelous things, they too could be a millionare. Personally, I would rather sacrifice the millions of dollars that James Steamer claims I can make, and rather have a family, accept my imperfect health (and treat it with the backing of health insurance), and spend money on fast food or an occassional movie once in awhile."
4,Excellent study of the Van Gogh's,"While admittedly not a major Altman fan, this is certainly my favorite of his movies. Tim Roth is absolutely wonderful and the resemblance is often eerie. Rhys is also excellent, and the movie does a great job of giving Theo his just due to those only topically familiar with the Van Gogh legend. The film features a soundtrack by Gabriel Yared in the same haunting vein as Yared's soundtrack for ""Betty Blue."""
1,Don't bother.,If you have an interest in painting or painters don't waste your time or money on this beautifully photographed but dull & trivial video.
2,broke easily,"we bought this umbrella for my son along with the matching boots. the boots are great, but the umbrella must have been cheaply manufactured as the hinges to keep the umbrella broke very easily."
1,Really not very good and this is why...,"The first complaint about this game is that skating seems to have taken a back seat to BMXing and er... walking around a bit. It seems like you spend more time off the board doing idiotic things like spraypainting a wall than you do on the board doing combos.Secondly, where are the female skaters? The 'hero' is an uncharismatic, generic guy. No choice to be female in story mode.Thirdly, the schoolboy laughs are just wearing very thin. Here's a tip, Tony, 'impressing hot chicks with your movez' does not a story make.This really isn't a very good game. The THUG games were better and the THPS games better still. In fact, I'd say forget it all, go out and buy Aggressive Inline. That was a much underrated game!"
1,Bad examples and images for teens,I was shocked by this game. We rented it to decided if we wanted to purchase it first. The game actually rewards the beating of homeless people--points are awarded for taking your skateboard and beating defenseless homeless people. Uggg. We will not purchase it or any other Hawk games like it. Can't the game just be about skateboarding?
5,"Think Yourself to Health, Wealth, and Happiness (2002 ed.)","This is a wonderful compilation of the best thoughts of Dr. Joseph Murphy. It's well organized and progressive in its effectiveness to help you to gain the most from life through the correct use of the subconscious mind. If you like meditations, quotes, thoughtful hints, then this book is for you. Handy reference and inspired reading await."
5,Life Saver,"If you have kids than you know that these things are vital if you don't want to have sippy cups that leak all over the place. The only problem is that they are easy to lose, hard to clean sometimes and apparently they are also delicious to dogs (at least mine think so). I was very excited to find these on Amazon since I was not looking forward to having to throw out the perfectly fine sippy cups just to get new valves.Now I know that my dog and sons can do whatever they want to when it comes to these valves since I have a great source for replacement ones. This is a must buy, and you won't be disappointed."
1,Should have been a single on this one,"I bought this CD strictly for the one song ""Rose Colored Glasses"". I should probably have downloaded the one title as I don't care for the rest of his CD."
4,Wonderful Songs,"This CD has some wonderful songs by John Conlee. My favorites are ""Lady Lay Down"", ""She Can't Say That Anymore"", and ""Friday Night Blues""."
3,john conlee,The cd skips on the first two songs that are played. the rest of the tape is just fine. thanks
1,Not the same taste or chocolate,I tried the new product but its not the same as when Ghiradelli made it. Very disappointed. They shouldn't bring a old time product back unless they can duplicate the exact taste/recipe.
3,Enough with the Christian backdrops,"I liked this movie but I am tired of almost every african american movie has to contain some chistianity in it. I'm a christian but there is no need to constantly shove religion down others throats when they can simply make an honest movie about love and life. Leave jesus out of these movies, enough is enough already we get it."
4,"Tasty, apparently","Bun likes these, but real food is better for them, this would be okay for an every now and then treat, stick w apples, melons, etc. for treats, better for bun."
4,Beyond The Deepwoods,This stunning introduction to the Edge Chronicles begins with a little boy named twig-but there is somthing different from this boy...He's not like the other woodtrolls of the Deepwoods...Every woodtroll child is told not to stray from the path-but this boy isn't a woodtroll-he realises his difference from the other children and does something totally unexpected...He strays from the path!This extreme page-turner will suck you into an exhilerating experience as you fallow twig on his perilous journy to find an answer...what lies beyond the deepwoods?This story is very well written and Chris Ridell's world is suberbly detailed-buy this book if you want to know what lies beyond the deepwoods! You won't regret it!
3,Careful . . .,A word of warning -- this reprint does not come with a copy of Hornady's famous map -- so you're out of luck on that score. The Introduction is very good.
2,"Confusing, not enough info","I know HTML pretty well but CSS not at all. I figured I'd get this book to teach myself CSS and since it had HTML in the title I thought it would teach the integration of both to create websites.I still don't know much about CSS after reading this book. I know some new terms but I've no idea how to implement them, never mind create a website using CSS.The book does give you a general outline of what CSS can do but other than that it didn't suit my needs at all.Besides all that, I found the book poorly laid out and rather boring to read."
1,where did all of the main characters go?,"I don't know about anybody else but from what I have read it seems like everyone feels the same way I do about what has happened to the Thoroughbred series. I mean like where did Cindy go not to mention Samantha, max, glory, blues king,ashleigh's other baby,wonder,pride,princess,mr wonderful,champion,honor,glorys kids, fleet goddess, fleeting moment,fleet street. Cindy and glory were my favorite not to mention shining, wonder,goddess and champion. It's just like bang champion and racing and all of the main characters are wiped out of existance. And who realy wants to hear about jumping. I like jumping and will take lessons some day but racing is more exciting to read about. I seriously say that we should all make complaints to the author. I sure hope Mrs. Campbell will take control of her series again before nobody will read these books."
1,This is very disapointing.,"This is so stupid!Christina is a selfish little brat!!What the heck happened to Ashleigh and Samantha's babies and Cindy and Friends. An author should read the series before they take it over! I was disapointed in this book, becausse Christina was being selfish and mean.All she was thinking about was jumping and she take any advice from anyone but Dylan.If you have'nt read this book don't."
3,HEY PEOPLE!!,This series needs to speed up in my opinion! I mean it gets SO (to me it does) boring when you read each book after you have already read one that took place just a couple weeks before. I wish they would speed things up and get to another character and stick with them. ALso!! This series was supposed to be about girls and their horses- I thought!! I mean come on!! Now their writing a book about Dylan called Dylan's Choice- gee I wonger what THAT is about!!
1,We want Cindy and Samantha!,"I haven't read this book, but have read all the others. What happened to all our old favorites? Tor, Mandy, Shining, Glory, Storm, Champion. . . GONE????? It seems a unique and wonderful series has been taken over by a horrid new writer who hasn't bothered to read the earlier books!!!"
3,I think this is awful.,"I can't beleive that all of you are getting so angry. It's not like it is the end of the world. Maybe the end of the series, but end of the world? Get real. Don't take me wrong, I'm mad too but what we need is a plan of action. I think we should send all of our awful reveiws to this new ""author"". Maybe if she is smart enough she can still save the series so it does not turn into something gay like the Saddle Club. If you think like me please wright to me at angiethoreson@hotmail.com. Maybe we can save the series before it is too late."
1,This is terrible!!!,"I have read all the Thoroghbred books up to number 25, and was very disappointed when heard about 'Christina' and her like of jumping. It seems that Cindy disappeared into to thin air. What happened here? I really miss reading the old series. Until the series returns to racing I have stopped reading, and I really think that the other author (Joanna Campbell) should return to writing, or stop putting her name on such lousy books. They were really gooo untill 'Cchristina' started. Thanks."
5,Manowar...The Soundtrack,"At first listen you might think have I purchased the right cd. There is no Manowar, it's all classical music. the cd has a soundtrack feel to it. There is also a narrator who has that Orson Wells touch to it.the cd booklet is all written in Norse. They give you a guide to translate. Once you translate the 10 pages you can happily say you can read and write in Norse. I know I can.Overall if you love Manowar, you'll grow to love this cd. Oh by the way, this is the first part of a trilogy. This is also the heaviest cd I have ever purchased."
2,Sounds great on the tracks that play properly,"Ordered this album because I am a fan of Bob Dylan's music. The first copy I received had the spindle hole punched off center. This resulted in a few of the tracks skipping, you could see the needle wobbling back and forth. I got an exchange through Amazon (great return service), and the second one I received had the same problem. I am about to return the second copy. This record was a nice heavy pressing and sounded good on the tracks that played properly, I guess they just had a bad run at the factory. I have seen similar complaints about other records this factory has made."
3,Not a big fan of Bob's,"I am not a fan of Bob Dylan (there a only a couple of songs that I like), however, I bought this album for my boyfriend, who is a HUGE fan of Dylan. Even knowing that at some point, I am going to have to listen to it! My boyfriend was impressed with the gift and is familiar with just about every song on it. I'm sure he would give this a rave review, if he was a bit more into the internet!"
2,Not the Maxell I remember,"I've used Maxell cassettes and VHS tapes over the years with no problems. Always a quality product....until now. I have used two 50-packs of the Maxell DVD-R and my DVD recorder indicates a bad disk error of some sort in about 1 in 5 of these DVD-R disks. At first I thought it was the DVD recorder, but I've since used Verbatim DVD-R and have not had one problem.10/8/10 update: Now the Maxell DVDs that successfully burned are starting to have read errors. What junk."
3,good but not great,"Reliable dvds that will work in the XBOX. The cons I have is the puke yellow tops on the DVD'S themselfs. Also they are 8x but when I burn they only burn at 4x. I have an LG DVD burner and it burned a phillips 8x dvd at 8x so i dont know whats going on. Another con would be that the resolution on video DVD's wasnt as good on the phillips DVD. I saw a lot more ""color copying"" on the maxell than the phillips."
3,King Diamond has nothing to fear,"Hearing that Manowar was coming out with a concept album, I was curious to see how well they could stack up to the King of concept albums, King Diamond. Well, let me just say that NOBODY compares to KD in this catagory.I give this new Manowar 3 stars because I am a hardcore long time fan of their's. I only rank Louder Than Hell below this one. It's a shame we may never hear a return to their pre-Louder Than Hell glory years.But fear not becuase Type O Negative just came out with another good one, NIN will have another one out very soon, and KD in June. Not to mention that Gwar just came out with one a few months ago. What a year!!"
3,manowar rules but this album,This album is good but not great to much expetation and they did a very similar album as warrior of the world. the other thing hear they put again recycling songs as king of king the album has 16 songs I think 6 or seven are intros and orche. the quick song are great no doubt manowar is pure metal but they need to give us something diferent and a double album of pure metal not intro. well in general 3 start album they can do a lot better
1,Horrrr..Horrrr..HII! Pardon!!,"I am a Manowar fan for more than a decade and this is the worst album to date. Like a Sleep medicine.The songs are nothing new. They are sleeping, because they sound exactly like the other (last 2-3) albums. Enough!When the start doing some good music?This album is a shame !"
1,"only one original band member, bad music","I first heard Exciter in Germany around 1985. I immediatly liked their sound guitar hooks. My interest peaked in 1986 with the release of their wonderful album, ""Unveiling the Wicked"", and after that, I was hooked. This latest album, Dark Command, is uninspired and droll."
2,Wishy washy as one can get.,"Martin Scorsese has said that he pulled the camera away from Travis Bickle as he talks to Betsy over the phone in ""Taxi Driver"" because it's just too embarrassing to watch. That sense of painful embarrassment pervades throughout the entirety of ""The King of Comedy.""It's a difficult film to applaud, but it's even more difficult to damn. ""The King of Comedy"" is one of those films that weeds out the less vigilant viewers among us. It's the story of an obsessive going after his desire--a career in comedy? Or just a moment of recognition?--in the most manic and unsympathetic ways possible. And it does so in meticulous (or you might say: slow) fashion. I felt that watching through to the end paid off--for me, the ending made the whole thing worth it. The thrill of the finale is thematic: it's not the conclusion to the story, but the question raised that makes this film more than what it seems.Still, it doesn't seem like awful much."
3,One of Scorsese's most underrated films,"This movie was extremely funny. Made as a retort to all the flak he recieved for the John Hinkley Shooting for Jodie Foster. Jerry Lewis Playing the straight man is more funny that it should be, and DeNiro is simply fantastic, a sleeper hit! my advice is rent it, it's not for all tastes."
4,"Loved it as a kid, my kids like it too","I watched Danger Mouse when it was on TV (20 years ago). I bought this set to get some of my old favorite episode.It is a ""British Humor"" cartoon, Monty Python era (not Wallace and Gromit). You either get it or you don't. My kids (4 and 6) love it, but my wife thinks it is silly."
4,"A nice NRG comp, mired by a couple of ubiquitous selections","This compilation covers a broad selection of mostly mid-80's hi-energy club tracks. Thankfully, they are all extended versions. The clunkers in this collection are Jackie Moore's ""This Time Baby"" and Jo-Lo's ""Last Call"" . Moore's track doesn't fit in with the rest of the selections here - it is 70's disco, plus it's already included on umteen ""Disco"" compilations. While ""Last Call"", orignally on Sylvester's homebase - the Megatone label, is energetic, Megatone has much superior tracks in it's catalog by Patrick Cowley, Modern Rocketry, and Sylvester himself.The Highlights here are the rarely found Deodato ""SOS(Fire in the Sky)"" and the 12"" mix of ""Jackie"" by Blue Zone (which features a young Lisa Stansfield on vocals)."
5,Review by a 3rd grade student,"I think you should read Esperanza Rising because of its wonderful details. The story is about a Mexican girl who got everything she wanted. On the night before her 13th birthday, her father dies. I won't tell you anymore so READ IT! (P.S. This historical fiction book has real things like the Great Depression and Esperanza Ortega)."
5,Esperanza Rising,I loved this book. The descriptive writing paints a well detailed picture for the reader. THe uniqueness of the plot line works to be interesting as well. A great book for literature circles.
3,riches to rags,"I gave this book a 3 star because I didn't think it was all that great, but it was very good (in some ways:-) ). This book it¡s about this girl, Esperanza, and is very rich. She lives in Mexico. Her father dies and then her uncle¡s burn down her house and she then is poor. She has to move to the United States to make some money. Their maid and servants came along also. They helped Esperanza get used to working all day. Then her mom gets very sick from inhaling dust particles and has to go to the hospital. Esperanza has to work even harder so she can pay for the hospital bill. The book is for all ages, you should read it!"
4,esperanza rising,The name of the book I just finished reading is called Esperanza rising. The author of this book is Pam Munos Ryan. Esperanza was rich intill she became poor.It was better then the book the giver.Esperanza got what ever she wanted. But then her dad got killed by bandits. They moved to the u.s. because her uncle wanted to force Esperanza mother to get merried with him. Esperanza mother got very sick.Esperanza was rich but then her dad died. So her mom was going to be force to merrie her uncle. So they moved to Los Angeles to runaway and start a new life. In Los Angeles her life started to change she wasn't as rich as she us to.I recomend this book to people who like historical fiction. I think this is one of the best book i ever readed in my life.
3,Esperanza Rising,"Esperanza Rising was a pretty good book. This book was basically about a Mexican girl who use to be rich but became poor. They lived on a huge ranch and owned a grape orchard. Sadly the night before her birthday Esperanza's father dies. After her father dies, her evil uncle takes over the ranch, and her and her mother become servants. The only way they could still live in their house was if her mother was to marry her brother inlaw. Esperanza's mother new that if she married him they wouldn't live a very good life. So now that they became servants they had to sneak from the ranch . They get in the back of a wagon and begin their journey to their new home. When they get there they go to their very small cabin. Esperanza and her mother had to work very hard and momma gets sick. Well I think that I am going to stop there so that I wont give any thing away. I do recommend this book though, you will enjoy it."
4,Great book to read,"This is a great book that shows that the simple things in life are what really matters. Esperanza being the main character is the typical rich girl who gets everything she wants. However, the hardships she has to go through with her family make her stronger. By the end of the story Esperanza is a total different person who sees and values life a different way."
5,Esperanza Rising,"Can you imagine losing your father, and moving to California? If so you should read Esperanza Rising by Pam Munoz Ryan. This book about a small 12 year old girl whose father was killed. After he father dies she and her mother go to Los Angeles, California. They end up working in the fields. In the fields she meets a little eight-year old girl named Isabel. She helps Esperanza do the chores.If you like books like House on Mango Street by Sandra Cisneros. Books by Hispanic authors, I would really recommend this book."
4,Esperanza Rising by Pam Munoz Ryan,"Summary: In the book Esperanza Rising by Pam Munoz Ryan, Esperanza is a rich girl living in Aguascalientes, Mexico on her father's ranch (El Rancho de las Rosas). After several calamities, her life as a rich 13-year-old girl takes a sudden turn. She is suddenly a field worker in California living in a small space with many others. Esperanza begins to realize that she had taken many things for granted.My Opinion on the Book: The book was a bit easy for me (I'm in 8th grade), so I recommend it for 5th-8th graders (I'm at a 12th grade reading level). It really helped me to understand the conditions of the Great Depression. I also liked how it introduced the reader to new Spanish words. I got really attatched to Esperanza because she is a free spirit and stands up for herself. She also loves and adores her family through everything. I enjoyed reading it and again, would recommend it to 5th through 8th grade students (ages 9 - 13?)."
5,First Prayers,This is a charming little book and exactly what I'd hoped when I ordered it as a baby gift. Flawless
5,Bowfinger International Pictures,"Wassup, America?! First of all, Bowfinger is a great movie. I love most movies, and this one is near the top. Steve Martin does real good in this movie and Eddie Murphy is SO FUNNY IN IT!My advice: rent the movie, love it, order the DVD, cherish it.PEACE OUT!"
2,Bowfinger:A Review,"A Movie that could have been much better. It was funny in parts, but these were few. Such a good cast and they wasted themselves on a movie that just did not have a good script to work with. Steve Martin is no ""Ed Wood."" At least that picture made some sense."
1,Settle in for a nap,"I like Eddie Murphy & Steve Martin, so I thought this would be a great movie - boy was I wrong! I suppose if you were in the ""movie business"" this movie could be funny but for the average guy it's not. Mr Martin's & Mr.Murphy's performances were one dimensional & flat; of course with that script they would have to be.So settle in for that long winter's nap."
1,a waste of time,"A total waste, bore, horrible, you name it. Nothing funny or clever. Anyone that likes it should get a life and doesn't know humor. I seriously doubt your maturity level."
3,Funny enough but less than memorable,"This movie is all about a cheezy ""B"" movie producer on his last legs financially. In his despair, he finds what he thinks is the perfect script and a chance to make it in the big leagues. The problems is, no one will give him the time of day. He manages to talk some of his friends into helping him and conceives of a plan to make his movie using the biggest name in Hollywood. The plan involves filming the big start when that star is unaware of it. The results are funny. So too are some of the shennaigans the director goes through to make his dream come true. Steve Martin excells in this kind of role. So to does Eddie Murphy let loose with his stable of characterizations.It's funny, but it is not something that will remain in the long term memory."
3,GOTCHA SUCKERS,"BOWFINGER is so shamelessly bad that you can't help but like it in spite of its self. While struggling hard for guffaws, the movie manages some chuckles along the way. Steve Martin plays the titular character, a hasbeen producer who thinks he's found the perfect script in CHUBBY RAIN, an alien movie penned by his accountant. He wants to get superstar Kit (Eddie Murphy) to play the lead, but Murphy wants nothing to do with it. Martin and his ramshackle crew decide to film their movie with Murphy without him knowing it. Murphy is especially funny in his dual role and Martin is Martin. Kohl Sudduth, Jamie Kennedy, Heather Graham and Christine Baranski etch fine caricatures in support. Not one of Martin's or Murphy's best efforts, BOWFINGER is still entertaining in its own silly fashion."
5,Hidden Treasure,"I will spare everyone the usual ""plot review"" of Bowfinger. This movie is one of the best comedies ever made. Martin wrote a script of pure brilliance. Eddie Murphy's dual roles are comparable to the greatness of The Nutty Professor.As the usual spoof movies (Airplane, Spaceballs, Blazin Saddles) are wearing out there comedic welcome, Frank Oz and Steve Martin deliver a unique comedy style.The initial-run marketing campaign did nothing to support the true genius of this movie. But despite the lack of ""professional"" hype, this movie is definitely worth the watch."
3,Something is missing...,"The premise is great, it starts off with a lot to offer and great potential. The movie never seemed to get off the ground. There are parts that seem to be missing (maybe they are on the editing room floor) and many issues left unfinished. It also seemed like they just suddenly decided to end the movie. It was like the last 30 minutes was rushed. It just felt like something was missing and there needed to be more..... Both Kristen Scott Thomas and Harrison Ford are great in this movie. Bonnie Hunt also steps away from her usual comedic performances to make a great dramatic performance. Worth renting, but not one to add to the video collection."
1,Random Hearts,"This movie is the reason there should be ZERO STAR rating at Amazon. I am quite sure Random Hearts is the worst movie I've ever seen. Certainly the worst movie ever made with a mega-star like Harrison Ford.Uninspired script, frenetic story line, pathetic performances all combine to make the audience wish that ALL of the characters had gone down in the plane crash together and spared us all the next two hours of agony. I really feel like I wasted part of my life watching this one. But I must admit, it's kinda fun to hate it so much."
1,DONT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS FILM,"I has seen like a 2000 films in my life, may be more, and never never has seen nothing like this, is the worst film I ever seen, look it only have 2 reviews, that is because no one want to waste his time writing for this film, I think the same, But I want to prevent you, DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY IN THIS FILM, the actor and the acting is VERY GOOD, and all the movie is GOOD, excpet the script, is so bring, and stupid, and BORING, AND BRONG, AND BORING, is too slow, and BAD, Please DONT BUY THIS MOVIE. You have two thousand movies better, Like Saving Private Ryan, Life is Beatifull, Jerry Maguire, As god As get, The Sixth Sense, and many more."
2,Boring,The former mates of the couples are barely introduced before they're killed off so we feel nothing for them or about them. There's alot of dialoge and very little action. The subplot about a corrupt cop is distracting and the only thing in this movie thats random. I turned it off with 47 min left as the movie is too long and boring. I dont know why it got a pg 13 rating because there's no nudity or profanity.
4,Are there 2 versions of this movie?,"Looking at all the reviews listed here, there must be. The version I saw was an excellent movie, with Harrison Ford putting in a solid performance. I wish all the people who saw the other version could have seen the one I saw."
4,Excellent movie,"This is an excellent movie starring Harrison Ford, Kristin Scott Thomas and Sydney Pollack. It's a little slow only because of what is transpring...but the story line is excellent. I had been looking for this DVD and found it on Amazon. Good movie...good price!"
2,This movie was insulting...,"This is the classic case of a big budget movie, with no script. The acting, cinematography, production and initial premise were all superb; but the script was as empty as one could possibly imagine. I was insulted by the sub-plot (""Dutch A Cop on the Edge""), it was like they were trying to distact men from noticing how bad the rest of the plot was. Also, there was NO romantic chemistry between the two leads (it was like watching two robots kiss)."
4,"Hail! The King (Ford) and Queen (Scott Thomas) of ""Hearts""!","""Random Hearts"" is a mesmerizing movie. I have always been a great fan of both Ford and Scott Thomas, and this film did not leave me disappointed. I was very impressed at how Scott Thomas managed to downplay her English sophistication and become the ""tough-as-nails"" American Congresswoman Kay Chandler. This role proves that she is indeed a very versatile actress. Ford has become sexier with time! His role as Dutch Van Den Broeck in ""Random Hearts"" showcases a more sensitive side of the seasoned actor. It is truly refreshing to watch! Sydney Pollack has wonderful directorial vision, and that fact is evident in a great deal of the scenes in this movie.""Random Hearts"" allows the moviegoer to face the darkness of desperation and to come away with the sense that there is light at the end of the tunnel."
2,Strange Movie,"The basic plot to the movie is that Ford's and Thomas's spouses are having an affair together and die in a plane crash. Then Ford and Thomas develop a relationship together. A very strange plot and a very slow one too. I'm a big Harrison Ford fan and own most of his movies, but I won't be getting this one."
2,Rent It First,"This movie is the kind that only a few people would actually like. I hired it to see it but it wasn't what I expected for a movie rated in New Zealand as (M + Contains Violence & Offensive Language). I HIGHLY reccomend you hire this first and if you like it, buy it ,otherwise don't. This movie is fairly boring and not even good actors could save it! If you want to see a good movie with Harrison Ford, buy Air Force One! See Ya"
5,Impressive Debut,"This is not a book that starts off slowly and builds up momentum as it goes along. The action starts immediately with an attempted skyjacking that turns deadly, then continues at a fast pace to the very end. Starmer does a great job making her characters interesting, intelligent, likable and most of all believable. Taking the adventure into the sleazy underbelly of the drug trade makes this a very entertaining, fast paced read. This is the perfect book to take on a plane or to the beach. Once I started reading the time seemed to disappear. It's great fun, can't wait for more."
4,Three tales of terror provide fun for all,"There are three stories on this independently-done tape, a sort of anthology type. The first, 'The Strange Case of Ezra Bumble' is dark but funny, with a really cute girl. Barry King is really good as the blackmailing homosexual. The main actor is a little wooden, but I get the feeling he's supposed to be!The second tale, 'Bothered' is much darker and graphic. The mood is great and the end has a definite twist to it. Horror fans may like this one the best, but my favorite is definitely the third tale, 'Homecoming'. It's a creepy tale of Larry, a guy who's lost in the countryside and quickly gets involved with ghosts who may be something more than they seem.All in all, a good bargain for the money and well worth watching repeatedly. I recommend it."
3,Disc is scratched,As long as it works I am ok with it. I ordered it for a Christmas present so I hope that it works.
1,I never review but honestly Cartoon Network is getting on my nerves,Cartoon Network needs to understand their audience here. Unlike the other cartoons that they are trying to get kids into like Johnny Test this cartoon along with others like Regular Show are gathering a fairly large fan base amongst teens and young adults (the humor in these shows seems to strike a chord with their Adult Swim audience I think). They dont want a bunch of random eps like Nickelodeon tends to package with the Spongebob series dvds (hell even Nick is smart enough to have season packs AS WELL) instead they want a WHOLE SEASON. Plus a lot of these young people are tech savvy... what is going to keep them from just downloading the whole thing? They want a proper season package to show off as a symbol of their fandom. Get your head on straight Cartoon Network!
1,"Nope, not falling for it.","I'm not buying ANY of the Adventure Time DVDs unless I know I'm getting entire seasons.KNOW YOUR DEMOGRAPHIC. This show is primarily enjoyed by high school and college students who would rather have the entire season(s) of a program than a few episodes. Also, repeats? Not okay.Not buying this or any of the Adventure Time DVDs until some sort of proper season collection is out. I don't wanna waste my money."
1,Why would you do this?,Is it really that hard to wrap your mind around the concept of releasing an entire season of a show on dvd? Whoever thought that random collections of episodes would sell better than the full seasons is a dingus and needs to be fired from every job ever forever.
1,Why continue doing this?,"Not a review of the show, a review of this lame release.Just release the Season Sets, please. As stated before, this show is enjoyed more by young adults and college students, not 5 year olds. This isn't Dora. We want season sets and are willing to BUY them.But guess what? That demographic is savvy enough to just torrent these episodes and burn their own discs if you don't give them what they want. So please, just let us BUY the season sets for this show.All of what I said applies to Regular Show, too. Catch a clue, Cartoon Network."
1,No full seasons? No good review.,"This show is great, but these products blow. Every other tv series ever releases full seasons, but this one doesn't because they must hate their fans. Don't buy this crap."
1,This start is for Cartoon Network,"I don't know what the math is going on at Cartoon Network but seeing this release and not the Season releases makes me think it isn't good.I love the show but like others have posted, not going to buy this when all I want are the season episodes in one DVD set. Seems like it is tough for them to perceive what people want to actually buy, so you have to resort to hurting one of the things you love the most with a turd review so when somebody at CN reads to try and figure out why sales and overall acceptance of a product they release isn't so great, this is what they see.So poot on this DVD release, stop messing around with whatever marketing formula made you come up with it and just release the season box sets from now on. Everybody wins."
4,A tribute to the pioneers of Archaeology and their work.,"This book was first published in 1949 and then enlarged in 1967. Altogether it has been translated into 26 languages and read by many millions of people. It is easy to see why.This book traces the origins of Archaeology and those who were involved in the great discoveries. Commencing with the great statues of Pompeii, Troy, Mycenae and Crete, we then move on to the Pyramids - with sections about all those who became involved from Napoleon to Carter. Next we find the great Towers of Assyria, Babylon and Sumeria before concluding with the great Temples of the Aztecs, Mayas and Toltecs.This is a fascinating book which is able to give the layman an expert's insight into the greatest archaeological finds of history.NM"
2,Sluggish and a boring play...,"This play is and seems to be boring. DON'T BE FOOLED BY THE NAME, IT IS! This all takes place in a court house and there is not another set or anything else. The judge speaks most of the time with some alternating characters. The ending is also very predictable. This play (on the plus side) shows how it can be in a court room and how being prosecuted can feel. As an audience member, i would feel sorry for the men/women that go up there on the stand. But no matter, the play is a boring sluggish one about a predicament that doesn't seem that well established."
4,"Yes, no, don't know, I don't care","The Rutles were conceived and created by Eric Idle for a television special that parodied the Beatles. The music was written by Neil Innes, in a perfect Beatles pastiche style. This second Rutles album was released in response to The BeatlesAnthology]] CDs. This time around, the Rutles don't do as many parodies of specific Beatles songs. Some songs are identifiably similar to particular Beatles songs, but most of them are just songs performed in a Beatlesque style. I don't like the album as much as the first Rutles album, but it's still a very good album. Some of the songs are quite amusing, actually. Good show, lads!"
3,Twist & Rut,"Less like the funny satire Rutles soundtrack and more like a Grammy nomination for best contemporary or laid back album; one of the tracks is ""Eine Kleine Middle Klass Musik"" which explains a lot in that this album is not as biting as the excellent soundtrack."
4,Realistic Sci-Fi,I gave this a four star because it continues Caves of Steel perfectly with an all new problem for the main characters. All the main aspects of the first book are kept the same but this introduces more psychological effects to people and reveals some things left unknown in the first book. I recommend this to anyone who likes sci-fi that isn't unrealistic past the new technologies developed which one must accept to enjoy any sci-fi book.
3,too glitchy,"i think it was fine when i first bought it - it's been some time since i've moved around my office and picked up drawing in photoshop for fun, but when I first got it I think it worked fine. Now, ive been trying to use it for the past 2 days with new batteries in the pen and it just glitches out. you'll start drawing and the pen won't work, or you'll attempt to draw and it just wont mark it in photoshop, it shows the pen moving but no ink is put down. i'd really recommend a different product other than this. i guess it shows you get what you pay for."
2,A waste of money,"I would not reccomend buying this product. I bought if for myself around the holidays because of the good price. It worked great for about a month and a half, but then up and died on me. That's what I get for going for the bottom-of-the-line product."
5,This is like GOD SPEAKING ABOUT MIRACLES,"Garry Kasparov comes across so well in this video. He's charismatic and down to earth --and able to communicate and teach in a universal and accessible way. It's like having him in your living room when you start the dvd. I bet even people who don't know a thing about chess would find this fantastic just because it's him. The other really cool thing in this DVD is that the chessboard illustrates what he says with highlighted squares and arrows. Any one who ""experiences"" his private tutoring will be able to impress others with their chess smarts & newfound vocabulary. I totally recommend this title for all chess players and young, school age chess players too. Advanced players will want to pop this into their computers so they can use the games database and analysis functions.And really, since he's really the best chess player ever in history, this is really equivalent to God speaking about miracles."
2,The item sent has different casing than it shows,"It is deceiving. The jacket show it as gorgeous but the actual thing is a very cheap one. I have heard before about the Aamzon that it is a sellers' world and buyers' losing ground, I support that after purchasing several items from Amazon. Beware of Amazon Sellers especially for non-book items. Those are cheap and full of misleading information. There is no easy process to get refund like ebay."
4,I liked it!,It was an incredible story about a young girl and the struggles of her mother who has done nothing but try to protect her and do what is best....
4,Great family story,"This was my first book by this author and I really enjoyed it. It has a little suspense, but it's mostly a touching family story. I highly recommend it."
1,"poor choice, nothing specific",the book was a big disappointment. It didn't give me any specific information that would help me to boost my baby's development. Waste of time and money. It was very cheap anyway...
5,"Led Zeppelin, ""Led Zeppelin 1"", 1969","Great album from a great band. In 1969 Led Zeppelin realesed there bluesy hard rock debut album that took the world by storm. There was no other band like Led Zeppelin they truly were one of the few bands that defined the 70s all of there albums are regarded as classics, there debut is great and contains such led zeppelin classics as dazed and confused and communication breakdown classic album and really shows how the blues influenced there music so much"
4,The Blueprint For Things To Come,"At its essence its a tribute to the blues, but charges its way into something bold and new. Dazed and Confused, Communication Breakdown are evidence of this new sound and intensity that would become part of this legendary influential band."
5,It's coming back home to you!,"Led Zeppelin's first album was a hell of an impressive debut. I think it's safe to say that the world had never heard anything like it before. It's complex, subtle, idiosyncratic and visionary. Just listen to the acoustic grace of ""Babe I'm Gonna Leave You"", the heaving inevitability of ""Communication Breakdown"", the enveloping roar of Robert Plant's vocals on ""Dazed and Confused"" and the pop flavoring of ""Your Time is Gonna Come"". This is a great album that presaged a lot of the hard rock music of the '70s, and I highly recommend it."
3,the remastering sucks,"They could have done lot better.it is better than previously released, but with todays technology, it's a disappointment.I would recommend it for archive purposes."
1,Buy a Foreigner CD insted.,"I'm so sick of people slamming Foreigner,Dire Straits which are the greatest bands and all they listen to is hugly lousy bands like Led Zeppelin,Pink Floyd,Rolling Stones,ACDC. Robert Plant is a huge joke of a singer,just cant sing and sounds more like a baby. I hate Led Zeppelin and they surely never made a good album. Foreigner were miles, miles better than Led Zeppelin and they have a great lead singer like Lou Gramm,why can't everyone sing a lot like him???? Avoid Led Zeppelin at all costs,go buy Foreigner's 4th album insted. Believe me, you will love one of the songs off that album. Led Zeppelin are huge loosers and meant for people with a very poor taste. Foreigner are winners and for people with good taste."
1,Totaly Agree-Led Zepplin ain't NOTHING!!,"I totaly agree with the previous reviewer. In fact, Led Zepplin is ALREADY forgoten -- NOBODY in my hi school has ever hear of them, or any song they've ever done. The only thing I disagree with the previous reviewer is about what is a real band. Duran Duran -- Hah! They ain't nothing either. If you want to hear REAL music, check out Britny Spears and Ricky Martin and Cristina Aguilera. If you want to hear REAL bands, look for N'Sync and the Backstreet Boyz. Now that's stuff that will stand the test of time! If you don't believe me, just ask yourself: When you go to hi schools today, who do more people try to dress/look like: Britny Spears or Led Zepplin? The answer should tell you who is going to be remembered more in 50 years."
5,if you dont like it you are a retard!!!!!,"this is #3 on my top 6 album list(phisycal graffiti,led zeppelin 4,led zeppelin one,animals,meddle and dark side of the moon.)the best song is how many more times. if you dont like this you are a retard!!!!!!"
2,Booooooorring.,"This was one whopper of a disappointing album. After hearing such effusive praise lavished on this legendary, phenomenal album my hands were nearly shaking with awe when I popped the CD into my player. And you know what? I nearly fell asleep listening to this piece of junk. If anyone thinks this is the greatest hard rock album ever recorded, then do what is called ""expanding your musical horizons"" This album is really just a slightly louder Jeff Beck Group . I would even go so far as to say that it's actually better than The Jeff Beck Group, but that's not saying much because they weren't great."
3,It began it all...,"Led Zep I began the whole hard rock revolution, however it is not the best album by the fantastic band. On the first side (if you have the original vinyl as I do) or, on the CD, the first 4 tracks, there is already a mix. Good Times Bad Times, Babe I'm Gonna Leave You and Dazed and Confused are all excellent, but You Shook Me is a terrible piece of filler unworthy of being on the album. Later on there are some other good tracks (Communication Breakdown) and some bad (I Can't Quit You Baby). The album does have some fine moments, and is worth adding to your collection is you are a Led Zep fan, but if you are a begginner I suggest you start with Led Zep II or even better Led Zep IV, and if you're looking for their most complex, interesting record go for Physical Graffiti."
4,Led Zeppelin,"The first and best Zeppelin album. Robert Plants vocals are Intense and shrill yet with a strange vibe which I guess chicks in 70's liked about him. Jimmy Page is still one the best guitarist. The way he plays is lead is amazing and the he makes psychedelic vibe.Remember this is only one person doing guitar no rhythm guitar, no lead guitar, just Jimmy Page playing every thing on guitar. You can't forget the drums and bass kick ass too.But Page and Plant had it together. Plant is nothing with out Page."
5,Review #7,"Great Remix Album. What a great version of ""What's Going On."" Kind of disappointed with ""The Goonies"" version. I thought it was going to be the extended version used in the music video. If you don't have any of Cindy Lauper's remixes I strongly recommend to buy this album."
2,Mahjongg Tiles of Time 110 does not work on Windows Vista,"this product did not work at all on my laptop, the laptop has Windows Vista and every other game I have works but this game, when I hit install did nothing, even with the game in the computer I could not play it. I have no idea why? I have all the other games from EA games Mahjongg and play with no problems they are all on my desktop, thought I might like this one but no luck. I may be computer illiterate but every other game I have works. Why doesn't this one?"
5,A Must Have For Panda Collections,"Even after my cat chewed the plastic bamboo off of this panda, it is still by far my favorite in the collection. Very well made even by my exacting standards, and irresistably cute. Not the most snuggly stuffed panda ever made, but definately has personality."
4,anothr side of brandy,"As a biggggggg fan of Brandy I loved this film. I do agree that the story could have been more detailed than it was, but the music compensated for the whole film. it was nice to hear Brandy sining live and finally getting to see her singing her songs on her album, which is the bomb! I must admit not really a big fan of Ms.Ross, but must admit her performance was good and so was her song. All in all this movie shed a light on both actors in a deaper way."
1,"Og, what happened?","I loved the original 'ragpicker' book by Og Mandino -- The Greatest Miracle in the World.' This sequel was written about 10 or 15 years later and something happened to Mr. Mandino in that time! He seemed more interested in telling you about all of his accomplishments, all of his material possessions, etc. than the inspirational message in the original book. Further, he replaced much of the God-based inspiration with politically correct platforms.Just bizarre to me how an author could change that much. I read a couple other reviews from disappointed readers and ignored them. Now I wish I would have believed them.I still love the older Og Mandino books, however, especially the Trilogy, but this one isn't worth the waste of time or money, or worth the disappointment in this author that I've looked up to....read at your own risk."
1,Dont waste your Money!!,LAME!!!!By far on the top 5 of the worst movies I have ever seen. This shit is up there with Broke back mountain. People who make this crap need to be slapped!
2,Poor acting,"It would have been possible to make it in one DVD, instead of two; sometimes it is boring and redundant, and the acting is awful !"
2,Babbling Brooks,"A few interesting ideas here -- including a sequence in which Dracula enjoys a bit of sunshine -- but on the whole, Mel Brooks's shticky spoof of Francis Ford Coppola's BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA (with visual homages to Universal and Hammer horror) keeps taking the easy way out. The result feels rather like a middling ""Your Show of Shows"" sketch stretched to about eighty minutes. Leslie Nielsen is miscast in the title role (which really cries out for a Sid Caesar), and only Harvey Korman and Brooks himself seem to understand how this material should be played. Production design looks nice, though."
2,Dead on Arrival,"How can the other 94 reviews on this site give this movie an average of 4 stars?!! At best, it is a two star movie experience and that is being very generous. Dead and Loving It only rates the second star because it is a rather good looking movie and it has a good cast. What it doesn't have is many funny jokes. That Mel Brooks wrote and directed this is hard to believe and it is far down on the list of his best work. Someone here compared this favorably to his (and Gene Wilder's) ""Young Frankenstein."" They must have been insane. ""Young Frankenstein"" is possibly the best of all the Mel Brooks comedies, while this is close to the worst. Please note this is from someone who is a fan of both Mr. Brooks and Mr. Nielsen and also a lover of vampire movies. It simply is not very good."
5,This is a GREAT movie! Go and get it!!,"Leslie Nielson is great, I suggest you rent this today! If you like comedy and Leslie Nielson, you will love this also!"
5,Dark Humour,"""Dracula: Dead And Loving It"" is another Mel Brooks masterpiece, among his best alongside ""Robin Hood: Men In Tights."" This is a fantastic and amusing movie with good jokes and lots of funny scenes. You will find yourself laughing your lungs out as you watch the movieMel Brooks took the horror story of Bram Stoker's Dracula and made it into a hilarious movie. Leslie Nielson played his role exceptionally well producing some unforgettable funny scenes. This is a well made movie with exceptional cinematography and great acting. I have watched the movie several times and can't stop laughing. The mirror scene to me was the height of the comedy.Highly recommend to people with a sense of humour. Also recommended that you buy ""Robin Hood Men in Tights"", if you have not already done so."
5,"Dracula, Dead & Loving It!","Funny man Leslie Nielson is superbly classy in this offtake of another ""Dracula"" film. His humor & one lines will keep you laughing continually in this spoof & with Mel Brooks Harvey Korman actors who compliment him its a must buy."
1,Laughing Gas???,"I think the other reviewers definatly were under the influence of laughing gas because I don't think I laughed once throughout the entire movie. This movie was absolutely terrible. It doesn't even deserve one star, because nothing about this one shines."
5,BITING COMEDY,"If anybody could have made ""Dracula"" funny it is Mel Brooks and Leslie Nielson,and they scored big with this. If you like to laugh, watch it."
3,Baby Vapor Rub,"This baby rub smells odd. I prefer the Ah-Choo! Chest Rub. It smells so nice. Little Colds was a lot cheaper, but I prefer the smell of the Nature's Baby Organics."
5,stick waffles,"Ordered this 3/27/08, arrived4/1/08,fast shipment.Took the waffle maker to my daughter's for lunch for my 3greatgrand childern. The first waffle came out perfect,even though we gave it to the dog,VillaWare said to throw out the first one.The little ones ate them as fast as I could make them. They were going OH every time the ""beep"" sounded.We also made french toast. It was a BIG HIT.Clean up was easy.This is going to get a lot of use."
5,An Italian Treat,My mother-in-law used to bring these home from her trips to visit her family in Italy. For me it was love at first bite. I am so glad to find them here to order for her now that she is too old to travel to Italy to get her own.
3,"Maybe this was a good idea, on the drawing board","I was a Big Fan of Jean's Supremes recordings, and was eagerly excited about her solo debut. I just don't understand much about this album. The musical styles are all over the map, and she's singing, screaming, cooing. There's even a few of Michael Jackson's Hee Hee's & Hoo Hoo's. I still listen to it, after all these years. I just don't understand if there's any musical direction there at all. what was A&M trying to do with her Talant? After all her Supremes success, this album lacks any real Bright Ideas. Jean's vocals are Wasted on most of these tracks. Sad, because I really wanted to like this. What was A&M thinking?"
3,avoid,"This is yet another compilation of hits and assorted album tracks. It's rather mind blowing how many of these ""greatest hits"" discs there are. There's no denying the Beach Boys greatness, but this is certainly not the 1977 album ""Beach Boys Love You"" for anyone willing to risk getting this to see."
3,Not thrilled,"I thought this product would be pretty useful, as my 2 girls rip the crust off their sandwiches and make a mess. I was disappointed the first time I used it, it kind of just squished the bread and there was jelly all over."
2,"I'm sorry, but no","No one should have this much belief, when they do they begin to contradict themselves. Like in that ""stop consuming animals"" song they talk about killing humans but we can't kill any stupid animals.And the whole gay thing, I mean woopee. When I hear a hetero love song I never hear all that ""receiving end"" metaphor.And the whole punk thing, I just don't get what they think they're doing. They're never really talented and they never make much progression with their music. Not like some good indie bands like Placebo and Cooper Temple Clause.No thanks"
5,woo-hoo! classic punk-rock!,"This is in my humble oppinion the best album ever. It just kicks too much @ss. My fav. song is ""Gifts"", it's just amazing. Can't find words to express it. It is basicly a fast-paced pop punk with awesome lyrics and a lot of things to say. PROPAGANDHI! If you like them you'll like Randy too, they're on prop.'s record label."
5,Political punk at its best.,"Gotta love this CD. ""Meat is STILL Murder"" is a great song with a great message. If you love punk, then you'll love this album. ""Consider someone else - stop consuming animals."""
1,Garbage!!! Don't waste your money!,"Purchased this MP3 player through TigerDirect.com.I had to reformat it after only 1 day because it has a glitch that puts it in permanent wait mode until it's reformatted. Even then it took me almost an hour to do it, because it put the computer on wait mode, too! Ridiculous!!!If that wasn't bad enough, the increase volume button stopped working after 3 days. We were able to turn the volume down to 00 (mute) but had no way of increasing the volume, because the button doesn't work!This MP3 player is complete junk - I'm in the process of trying to get TigerDirect to replace it ... I've yet to see!If you want a mp3 player that actually works, don't get this one!!"
1,fry pan,"After receiving the wrong item twice, 12"" Mirro covered frypans, the third replacement was a 10"" frypan but not a T-fal pan as the description indicated. They did send UPS to pick up the two incorrect items and I donated the other...a not T-fal...not a heavyweight pan to Goodwill. I have bookmarked this dealer as a no-go for future orders."
5,Dilbert Is The Greatest Show To Watch Over and Over,"The review saying that Dilbert is something I would not like to watch over again, that is the stupidest review I have ever in my life ever read. The only bad thing about this is the box design, they use a standard flip book pointing to left instead of the right like the Simpsons. I know the flip must be a good think about the DVDs, but they need to boycott making the flip book designs and start making individual cases.Anybody who writes a nasty review, will see a nasty one the day it is written during the late afternoon, it should be posted."
2,Not Funny,I really regretted buying the DVD set. The comedy wasn't there.I have always enjoyed the strip but the hip cynism in the strips comes across as very unfunny and not fresh or orginal in the show. The last two episdoes were awful.
4,TV series,"This set is on DVD, and is the TV series back in the late 1990's which ran for 2 seasons.Good for historical Dilbert."
5,Wonderful cartoons that every librarian should own,These cartoons are hilarious and no library should be without a copy!
2,"A couple of good recepies, too much irrelivant filler","This book has generally good to excellent recopies for Toddy, Eggnog, etc. But 23 pages (1/4 of the book) are on general bartending. Further another of the book is on simple common cocktails. There is only one Eggnog alternative (chocolate), one hot buttered run (Ice-cream based) one hot Toddy. This book is supposed to cover the topic and it doesn't."
1,Boring! ZZZZZZ,"I thoght this book was pretty boring, because Brian only complained about food and whined about the 'Secret'. I don't know about you but this book just wasn't made for me."
1,DISGUSTING (is there a such thing as NO stars),"This is a GROSS book. I guess it's realistic, but if you have a delicate stomach, DON'T read it. It's not interesting or an adventure or history or anything else."
3,I liked it,"The book is basically like a self-journey. The main character did his best to live in the wilderness with harsh conditions the best he could. He was physically beaten by large massive animals, bitten by many mosquitoes, and the anticipation to leave. He also wondered about the situation with his mother and her mysterious lover. I would suggest everyone to read this book."
4,Hatchet,I like this book because it has funny parts in it but yet some scary parts too. Another thing was Gary Paulsen is a very good writer and uses wonderful details and makes you feel you are Brian. Brian is the main character in this story but one thing that I didn't like about the book is the beginning of the story. I don't think that I would have kept on reading it if I didn't have to. But the part that kept me reading was when the plane crashed. That was one of the scary parts of the story. I recommend this book to people who like adventure stories.
2,hatchet,Boys book. not the best but I read it because it was required for school. Its ok though. Hi bye
2,TOO SLOW AND LOW,This reading is VERY slow and the volume is really low. I had to play it on my surround sound system so my class could hear it. I ended up reading the majority of the book to them out loud.
3,"Try this book, you just might like it.","This book is great, but i only gave it 3 stars because it starts out way to boring but makes up for most of the boring parts once you get past the begining."
5,Hatchet,"Brian's parents are divorced. While flying to his dad's place the piolet has a heartattack. Brian is the only person on board the plane except the piolet. His only chance to survive is to fly the plane, but he doesn't know how to fly a plane that much. Brian has to crash land the plane in a pond away from the heart of the forest. Once down on the ground in the deepths of a forest Brian has to survive with only a hatchet. Will he make it? You will have to read this book to find out."
2,hatchet,The title of my book is Hatchet it was written by gary pawlson it is a fictional book. Brian's parents are divorced and he is on his way to see his father. On the way there the pilot has a heart attack and dies.The plane crashes into a lake in the forest. There is no one else around to help. now he is stranded in the forest with only a hatchet and does many diffrent things to stay alive when a pilot comes and saves him. I thought this book was a very good book.
4,Hatchet Review by Nicky,"The book hatchet is a great book that recommend to kids. This book is a book about a boy name Brian who is visiting his father.On the way to his father the airplane crashed. The only thing he has with him was a hatchet that his mother gave him.The things I like about this book is that if you don't know any survival techniques,you can read about this book and find out about what your suppose to do.This book is one book that I really enjoy reading.This book has its own challenges or obstacles as you read.But at the end its surprising the way he acted towards all that happened to him.I recommend this book to kids who are into books that like about survival."
2,Poorly Written,"This book by far is the worst purchase I have made the last 18 months. Poorly written-too many loose connections. In short, not worth the read even when it hits the $1.99 price point."
4,scott's hatchet reveiw,"In Hachet brian robenson is going to canada in a small single engine airplain when the pilot has a heart attack causing the plane to crash in the middle of the canadian wilderness with nothing ecept the hatchet his mom gave him as a parting gift he uses the hatchet to survive by useing it to find and cut wood, to cut fruit, carve a spear, a bow, and arrows to make a shelter to make fire,and to survive until a rescue plane comes to save him he some how find a way to survive even though he gets hit by a tornado, atacked by a mousse, a porcupinne, and a skunk. I myself give the book 4 stars and would recomend it to anyone."
3,nice job,"The book, Hatchet, by Gary Paulsen, is an exciting book. With Brian getting in a plane crash, and being the only survivor, he is faced with a struggling challenge. He only has one useful tool, a hatchet. With this tool, he learns to hunt and build. His finds out he has major talents in hunting. This boy works and good things start happening to trying lads. Does Brian make it out alive? Mr. Paulson has made an intense novel."
1,Boring,This was very boring and uneventful. Plus the characters were very boringYour favorite Martian the nether and uneventful the nether
2,Good book but too slow,"Stranded. A thirteen-year-old boy named Brian Robertson crashes a plane in the wilderness of Canada on his way to visit his dad. He is in the middle of no where with nothing but a hatchet to survive. He is completly alone.My opion on the book ""Hatchet"" is that it was too slow. The plane crashed then after that the story gets a bit dull. It only talked about how he was thirsty and his mosquto bites hurting. It wasn't very interesting for the first 150 pages. After that, there was some exiting and iteresting parts in the book. I won't tell you what they are because you have to read the book to find out. I do not recommend this book to children under the age of ten because there are some suasidal thoughts and suisidal actions involved in the book. If you like a survival story, then read this book. Even though I said the book was slow, it is still a good story and showed GREAT detail. Many people love this book so give it a try even if it is slow.By Thomas English"
4,The Exelent book,Hatchet is a very good book. If you should buy this book you should know a couple of things you should know. First of all you should all ready know tha over 2 million copys are sold. Secondly it is a exelent story about one boy struggles to live in the woods. Last of all you should always stay open minded when reading this book.
1,my dum paragraph,I gave Hatchet a 1 star because cried for a friend like a baby.It was boring because he was saying the same words over and over.In a nother word it ... .
2,Hatchet By Gary Paulsen,"I just reviewed reading the book Hatchet, by Gary Paulsen.Two good parts were the setting and the author.I think the setting was the perfect place for a action\survival story. Also I liked the author. Gary Paulsen is a awesome writer and I think he should write more books.On the other hand,there were two things I disliked. One thing I didn't like was the end. I thinkhe sould of got the survival pack way before he got resced. Last, I didn't like the dream. He should of realized that he could make fire right after the dream.Over all, I think this book was an "" okay "" book."
4,Good book,"It was an interesting book because it had a lot of action, it was a thrill reading it, and it always kept you wanting more. You never knew what would happen next. It showed you responsibility and determination on how to live on your own. Brian, the main character, went through many struggles and got through them with just having one hatchet. I really recommend this book if you're the type of person that thinks they can do just about anything."
2,Robinson Crusoe NOT!,"Absurd, trite, predictable! How many words does it take to say stupid, dumb and a complete waste of my time"
3,THIS BOOK SUCKED,OH MY GOD THIS BOOK SUCKED SO MUCH THAT I THREW UP AFTER READING IT! I have 3 more words
4,Movie?,"I loved the book and I hope that the movie will be as good the book is about a boy, ( Brian)and he is flying on a 2 person jet and the pilot dies of a heart attack and Brian must take over the plane. He lands and I do not want to spoil it. READ IT!! It is good I have read reveiws on the movie and it seems like some people liked it and some people despiesed it."
2,Something's Missing,"There is something lacking in Paulsen's style. There was no distinguishable climax, and plot structure was no where to be seen. There was sometihng unrealistic about Brian's survival attempts. It was as if the book droned on for ever, and the end was no where in sight. Things that should have been summarized and made shorter took up pages; things that should have been packed with detail, description, and emphasis took a matter of sentences. I was itching in my seat for the book to be over. It's keeps you on the edge of your seat because you really want to get up and put the book down."
2,Hatchet,"I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in survival. This book would help you if you were on a plane and it crashed in the northern woods. This book taught me so much about surviving in the wilderness. It also educated me how to make a fire. ""As he was rubbing the sticks together, he realized that he needed something out of metal and as he blew a fire came."" Another example of what it taught me would be when he killed his first rabbit ""He cooked it like he cooked his first bird he cooked it on both sides until it was crisp on both sides."" In conclusion, if you are fascinated by the outdoors and you would like to know how to survive, read this book."
4,Entertaining Read,"An entertaining read about a young man who has to learn to survive in the wilderness with little more than the clothes on his back, a hatchet, and his own wits. I thoroughly enjoyed it."
5,The book keeps you on the edge of you're set,The book was great. I would recmend it to any one who loves the outdoors as much as I do.
3,kylie's review,I thought the best part was the start when all the action started. During the book i found it a bit boring but still good and exciting. Overall a great book to read i am hoping to get the rest in the series. kylie
5,Why this book is so good.,"This is an awesome book because it tells an epic adventure of a boy who is determined to live in the Canadian wilderness. He is able to do so by learning how to make weapons, kill and cook prey, make shelter, and cherish the memories that he has of his mother and father. When compared to other books this book usually comes out on top with me because it is an action and a thriller all in one. I would get a quote that I could comment on, but there reeally aren't any that are good. In my opinion this book is really for only those who love to read about people who risk their lives just to save thei own."
3,Hatchet Review,Hatched was an enjoyable book. It was about a boy named Brian Robeson who was on his way to his father's house in Canada when the pilot had a heart attack. The pilot died and Brian had to take over. He flew for a few hours until he finally crashed into a lake. He spent the time he was there looking for food and getting through disasters such as tornados. I think that people who enjoy reading detailed adventure books will like this.
4,Exciting Book,"The book Hatchet is about a boy named Brian Robeson. Brian was going on a trip to go see his dads because his dad and mom got a divorced. Brian mom gave him a hatchet before he left to go see his dad in Northern Canada. The pilot had a heart attack and died. Brian tried to fly the plane and crashed. He landed in the wildernness by a lake and his life was hard. ONe way it was hard was that he could not make a fire so he ripped up a $20 bill to try to make a fire and i did eventually. There were other problems too, like to find food and to protect himself. Do you think he well make it to go see his dad?I thought the book was ok but I didn't like it when the pilot had a heart attack. IT was exciting to read."
5,Compelling Survival Adventure,"Imagine you are a child on a plane flight in a small plane across the Canadian Wilderness, when the pilot suddenly has a massive and extremely lethal heart attack, leaving you alone. Imagine the sum total of your flight experience is the few minutes when you held the plane straight and level earlier in the flight. That is the position Brian finds himself in at the start of this novel. Surviving a crash landing, this city boy, with no survival training and nothing but a hatchet and the clothes he is wearing to help him, must learn how to survive in a wild and unforgiving place.This is a compelling survival story, well written, gritty and realistic. It captivated me despite being well over its target age range, and it will be equally captivating to a young adult audience. Thoroughly recommended."
5,Good book for Middle School Boys,Most kids like this story. The good news is sometimes they even read more by the same author. That is always a plus.
3,for young people...,"13-year-old goy,Brian,was left alone accident near the lake because of the air plane accident. He had to survive there until someone, especially his parents,will rescue him. Being worried about his parents' devorce, he tried hard to live. Then he grew an adult from a child little by little. I think that this book is expressing 13-year-old boy's feelings well.Probably many young people could feel sympathy for Brian. While, I think that the advance of the story is slow. Perhaps some peoplefeel irritated, but this story would give you something good.This book sould be read by young people, or who wants to remind the youth ful days."
4,survival!,"Brian who was thirteen years old survived in the wildness alone. He learned many things through the survival and he's been twice man he was. I like the gradation of Brian's growth. Because he was weak when he arrived, but he became strong and brave little by little. Also, the Hatchet taught me many important things. For example, ""never give up"". I want to recommend this book to everyone without regard to age or sex. If you read it, you can learn somothing important from the Hachet."
3,Hatchet,Brian is a boy whoes parents are divorced and is only fourteen. I enjoyed this book a fair amount. I would recommend this book to children of divorced parents. I really liked the beginning of the book because there was a lot of action and the last part of the book because I liked the way Brian got saved from an island but I was not so fond of the middle of the book. I found the middle part of the book kind of boring. I liked the thought of all of the dangerous animals in the book. Overall I really liked the book. I give this book 3 stars.
4,I recomend this book to people who like Gary Palsen books.,I think this is an exciting adventure that you'll love.It is about a boy who is going to visit his father.He flies in a plane and the piolet has a heart attack and dies then the plane lands roughly and then he needs to survive until someone comes for him.
4,Brian is thirteen years old and is lost in the wilderness.,"Brian Robeson is thirteen years old and he is struggling with the fact that his parents are divorced because of the ""Secret"". He spends the school year with his mother and the summer with his father. Brian was flying to see his father when the pilot has a heart attack and the plane crashes. Brian survives and is in the wilderness with no way of communication to the outside world. He comes to realize that the hatchett his mother had given him has come in handy. He relies on his courage to survive."
4,The Hatchet was a good book,"I thought the Hatchet, was a good book,but at first in the begining it wasn't all that interesting but when I got more into the book it got to be more interesting and fascinating. So I would recommend this book to people who like a little bit of action and for people who can take some boring parts."
4,Surprised,"i read the first chapter of this because my daughter was doing a book report. I was not happy!! then as i read on i realized that it was not as bad as i had origionally thought.The beginning disturbed me and i was not sure how she would react to it, she could have cared less. She does not even like the book, and this kid loves to read, she takes books everywhere we go, car rides, resturants, even on the ride to walmart! so the fact that she didnt care for it surprised me.its a good book though, i actually got it back from her to finish!"
3,A GOOD BOOK,"At first, I thought the book was stupid because it put me to sleep like a baby. The story is about a boy on an island by himself with no food no clothes. He had to survive on his own. I liked the whole book. I like the ending because he was rescued and he was safe."
5,hatchet was the best book I have ever read,I loved this book because it was about a boy surviving in the wilderness with only the clothes he has on and a hatchet that was givin to him by his mother
5,creative but very interisting and very gripping,this book is one of the best ive ever read. i have read it 3 times this year and who knows how many times in the past. The book makes you want to get lost in the woods to test your skills like brian did. i cannot express the pleasure i have every time i get to read this book all i know is that gary paulson is a master at storytelling
5,LOVED EVERY MINUTE,We read this book in the class room and i loved every minute of it i was like read more and more but they are like dont read a head that was so not fun But this book
4,Plane Trip Goes Bad,A twelve year old boy gets in a crash while going t see his dad. The pilot dies of a heart attach and the plane crashed into a lake. The boy survives the crash though. All he has is a hatchet. Read the book to see if he survived.
2,"Gory, Depressing & Boring","The Hatchet, by Gary Paulsen is not a great book. This book has too many gross descriptions. For example, when Brian shoots the animals and when the dead pilot is mentioned, the author gives overly gory details. But, perhaps this is what living in the wilderness is like. Because of this, boys might like this book better than girls might. I did feel bad for Brian, since his parents are divorced and he was all alone. Besides being gory, The Hatchet is also a little depressing and a bit boring. I also read the sequel, Brian's Winter, and it too is not one of my favorites. I had to read these two books for school and I would not recommend them since I did not enjoy them."
3,"Cornwall, New York, sixth-grader","I am a Sixth Grader. Hatchet was okay and had many good properties and many bad. A few things I didn't like about the book are that he kept `starting over,' and that the first half of the book was pretty much all about him starting his life in the woods. One thing I did like was that he met (and killed) many different animals. And still, the book is interesting and it makes you wonder what will happen next, although there are MANY slow bits. In conclusion, this is a reasonable book to read."
3,A Sister Of Mercy,"Patricia Morrison was the female singer for most of the Sisters Of Mercy's major work, and is also the woman whose beautiful face graces the cover of ""Floodland"" behind Andrew's. This is, so far as I know, the only side project she has done. It's a bit simplistic musically and lyrically, but her vocals are magnificent."
3,Chocolate bible,The book came in great condition. The only negative was it did smell like cigarettes. But all pages were intact and there was no writing in the book. Pretty satisfied.
3,Works ok for astronomy,"Bought this stool for astronomy where the height adjustment is very useful. Does not go low enough however as some of the dedicated (and more expensive) astronomy or drummer stools. Works fairly well. Only criticism is the plastic round leg pads have broken loose - 3 out of 5. They are glued on, and I can presumably re-glue them on.It was cheap enough, so am relatively happy with the purchase."
3,"Great read, but missed the Richest","This is an excellent list of american prominent billionaires - in manufacturing, natural resources and transportation. However author completely missed the mark on the REAL RICHEST PEOPLE - which are The Crown and The Bankers. Although mentioned in the book, the author dismissed JP Morgan as ""small bank"". However, JP Morgan owns a largest share of a private Federal Reserve Bank, and therefore has a license to print DOLLAR. That is besided owning huge shares of american railroad, steel and other industries. Also not mentioned were Kuhn Loeb, Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers and several more. Warburg is mentioned once, and not a single mention of Schiff or Rothschild. A shame, MISSED A MARK BIG TIME THERE.Also, too much ""jews are not allowed anywhere"" ""anti-semitism"" type of cry. Which are completely out of place, considering my comments above.But an excellent read otherwise, has some useful information."
5,Perfectly normal Connecticut flag-on-a-stick,"I really wasn't sure if I should give this product five stars or three. There's nothing exceptional about it as standard 4x6"" flags-on-sticks go. I have no complaints at all about the ordering and shipping process. It got here quickly and in fine shape. I slapped it under the iron quickly to get the wrinkles out and it looks just like it's supposed to.""Looking like it's supposed to"" brings up an important point, though. Many times around here I've noticed Connecticut flags with dark blue fields -- the kind you see on state flags from New York and Virginia to Nevada and Oregon. But the Connecticut flag isn't supposed to be dark blue. State legislation specifies ""azure blue,"" a shade much closer to what you see on this product. So kudos to the manufacturer and retailer for getting that detail-that's-not-a-little-detail right."
1,a big step backwards,"I own the first two major releases by this group, and they are wonderful. This album, though, sounds like a collection of b-sides, with none of the hard rocking or symphonic chord changes of the other two albums. This album is one CD too long, and even then it's half sound effects and static. Almost every song is in a dreary slow-jam beat, reminiscent of a group called Renaissance from the late '70's. This album, I hate to say, is virtually unlistenable. Sorry."
1,It's been a long time...,"It's been 12 years since I wrote my first bad review of this album. After Mandylion and Nighttime Birds, it was clear this group was creatively DONE. And they were. R.I.P. Gathering, your 15 minutes was up LOOOOONNNNGGGGGG ago."
4,This group evolves yet again.,"After first hearing this album I was somewhat dissapointed, however the more I listened to it the more it grew on me. This album is not as heavy as it's predecessors and if you expect a carbon-copy of Mandylion or N. Birds you may be dissapointed. My advice is listen with an open mind. HTMAP has some clever lyrics and the same great vocals of Anneke, but the guitars are a little more laid back than before. By the way, to the previous comment about there being 3 previous albums...there are actually 4. The album Almost A Dance is more uncommon than the other Gathering albums, but the band is re-releasing it and Always on their own label. Definitely worth buying if you like imaginitive, original music."
5,"Great Stuff, Complex, Unusual, Precise","Incredible vocals, precise renditions, no showy technical metal nonsense, you can tell these folks play well together and see the same thing in the music that they write. The first disc is a masterpiece, the second is ""Tooly"" and ethereal, but easy to listen to.I look forward to their next release."
3,SOME GOOD INFORMATION BUT A MIXED BAG,If your looking for a book jam packed with practical piloting techniques only don't buy the book. At the same time it mostly sticks to title and subtitle. I would give it three and one half stars if there was that option. The book does contain useful information with a broad range of topics from practical information such as landing technique to reasons to be skeptical of the FAA. I will keep the book around to reread.
3,The glass is half empty...,"Like the other reviewers, I am disappointed that it only contains 8 of the episodes from the third season. Those of us who bought the first two seasons are poker junkies and will pay the extra cost of producing the entire season. I can only hope the producers of the World Poker Tour will rectify their short sightedness and complete the rest of Season Three. Plus, the player commentary is what separated this from watching it on cable. Not continuing that style of production is a step backward. The eight episodes are still quality shows, but I agree with Poker Guru that the Bay 101 Shooting Star was the one of the worst episodes to have included."
1,One Size Does NOT Fit all.,"I am your average 6'7"", 230 lb giant with a quasi athletic build and out of the box I am telling you one size definitely does not fit all. I slapped on the knee pads and had to nearly cut off the circulation in my leg to attach the straps. Then I went nuts and knelt down. The straps fought me every inch of the way to the ground until they finally gave up when I made contact. I am hoping with a few rounds of paintball the straps will stretch out enough to get them even close to comfortable. Same goes for the elbow pads. I would say they are built for your average teenage player...not your average giant. Bigger Buyer Beware."
4,Knee and Elbow pads,"Though they're a little snug, the pads look great and do a great job. They don't shift around too much, and are plain in design."
2,"Unfortunately, the Hydra is a disappointment","The Ultra Hydra is conceptually a great device. Water / weather resistant, cool looks, voice recorder and radio as well as music player, runs on regular AAA batteries not some expensive specialty battery...But, unfortunately, when I bought mine, and followed the instructions exactly, it had problems: it would only skip after it played the first track of music. It initially worked for voice recording but then that function also stopped working. I was treating the device like a gem, by the way, and I tried multiple times to follow through the instructions, etc.The menu system then stopped working, too.I had bought it from 'TD' and tried to post a review -- they never posted my review! (at least they were friendly and gave me my money back when I returned it).Buyer beware. The Hydra needs to be re-engineered, and THEN if it is really good quality, I will be among the first to buy it! but not now. I am very disappointed in the device."
4,Remastered sound is superb!!!!!!!,"Just wanted to let the Raspberries fans out there know that the sound on these new imports is fantastic! I have the first two and i'm anxiously awaiting the final two to be released. They come in beautiful digipaks. I gave these first 2 albums 4 stars, saving the 5 stars for the awesome 'Side 3' and 'Starting Over'."
3,So-So,"Dairy Queen Days is the southern tale of Joe Pike Mosley and his son Trout who both are struggling to find themselves. Joe Pike Mosley comes from Mosley, Georgia, named after his family. As an adult he became a minister and fled the ways of Mosley Georgia and had a life with his wife Irene and son Trout. When the novel begins, Irene has been sent of to an institution in Atlanta, and Joe Pike and Trout are fending for themselves.Circumstances arise, causing Joe Pike and Trout to return to Mosley, where they both begin a search for truth in life. The novel is a coming of age story for both father and son, and their small town life. The book did have me craving Dairy Queen and there are a lot of funny, laugh out loud moments. The ending did leave me somewhat unsatisfied, with some abrubt endings and loose ends. I would have liked to understand the characters and why they did certain things a bit better."
3,BOSS OF BULLION CITY (1941),"BOSS OF BULLION CITY (1941)aka El Amo del Oeste(Western, Black & White, 1 hr 1 min)Universal - U.S.A.DIRECTOR:Ray TaylorCAST:Johnny Mack Brown (As: Tom Bryant), Fuzzy Knight, Nell O'Day, Maria Montez (As: Linda Calhoun)COMMENTS:It's a race to see who can get whom first when a tricky sheriff is exposed by Brown and his nit-witted stooge. Western shows Brown at his straight-shooting best.Maria stars as Linda Calhoun, a virtuous young lady who lives according to her religious beliefs and loves, in silence, the hero of this story Tom Bryant.This role was very important for her future, because it was the first one as a co-star; on the other hand, it is the only one of her movies in which she says some phrases in Spanish."
2,A little too pat,"Dead on the Dance Floor tries too hard to have a wide pool of suspects to the murder. The subplot of the homeless girl, while sweet, is too convenient-- she's homeless because her stepfather was trying to molest her and her mother wouldn't defend her, not because she was a bad kid; she just happens to set up camp in the yard of a sympathetic person; she just happens to be a natural dancer loaded with talent, and the sympathetic person works at a dance studio.But what really yanked me out of the story was the ballroom dance move called... The Pooper-Scooper.Every time I read that phrase, all romance & grace fled my mind while picturing baggies of doggie doo.I guess it was supposed to be humorous, but the attempt fell flat.The Pooper-Scooper."
3,Not exactly....,"This cd wasn't exactly what I was looking for, it does not really help you fall asleep. Some of the music can be annoying and it could have been more soothing."
2,So so,"So, so. I anticipated this being relaxing bedtime music - but it has some more uptempo stuff on it - not what I expected."
5,baby bedtime help,I have a two year old who hates bedtime. My mom told me about this CD and it really helped. He loves to listen to it when I put him to bed.
2,To up beat for sleep,"I agree with the other reviewer I found most of the music to be too up beat for falling asleep, and my problem is staying asleep, not falling asleep. Some of the music made my heart race and then I could not fall sleep. I tried this CD 4 times before calling it quits. I would not recommend this CD. I have resulted to using my very loud air purifier as white noise so that as I sleep the street sounds do not wake me up, but recently someone recommended to me trying a Homedics SoundSpa machine, which has all kinds of natural sounds for background noise when sleeping. I may try it. I hope this review helps."
1,Not Recommended - damages hair and fades rapidly!,"I strongly discourage anyone from using this terrible product. I purchased this product for my naturally medium brown hair that is perhaps 5% gray, and deeply regret using it. The product was very drying and damaging, even after a week of daily deep conditioning with my own conditioner (the included conditioner is a single use pouch.) More importantly, the color fades rapidly. I purchased this because I was tired of how quickly the semi-permanent 28-day dyes fade, but this is worse! Although the initial result was a beautiful rich brown just as pictured, the gray faded back to gray in one week and the brown faded to an ugly brassy color in 2 weeks. Unfortunately, the brassy color has not faded back to my original. The Clairol semi-permanent dye lasts longer without damaging hair and fades back to the original color not this brassy color."
5,white gold rope chain,This was just what I was looking for and the quality is superb. Thanks. A+A+A+A+A+A+
5,Worked great on my AQUA CLEAR 70,It worked perfect. I highly recommend it but I think that the price is a little steep. I am going to continue to look for a better price since I want to have a back up.
3,My wife doesn't like it,"No complains when it comes to service or pruduct, but the cut is not complementing and my wife doesn't like it. Guess I'll have to lose some weight"
4,NICE PANTS,I NEED A PAIR OF GOOD JEANS ANYWAY i COULD NOT FIND JEANS MY SIZE SO I TOOK A CHANCE AND WAS GLAD I DID THEY FIT GREAT
4,Great jeans for a reasonable price,"I was looking for something to wear on my off days as All the other clothes I have are t-shirts and work-related. These fit great, look great and seems as if they will last a long time. I can't really complain too much as the price makes it work."
3,Check your measurements,"I took a chance and ordered these jeans based on what others jean sizes have always fit me. This pair of jeans is at least two sizes smaller than my other jeans (Levis 569, Tommy Hilfiger). These jeans run equivalent to dress pant sizes for me. All of my dress pants are two sizes larger than my jeans."
1,Wrangler Jeans are impostors (mexico),"I love Amazon.com, but these Wrangler jeans look similar to Wrangler jeans sold in America; but they are NOT the same as Wranglers sold in America. My husband says the cut is different and they don't fit him as well. We noticed that the Wrangler label on the jeans is the older style than what is used on their jeans now. I'm not sure if they're just really old old Wranglers that were found in some warehouse or if they are impostors made in another country with the older Wrangler label on the back. Also, these jeans have stitching on the rear pockets and I guess the current (official) Wranglers don't have back pocket stitching anymore. My husband says, ""no more internet jeans for him!"" He wants to try on clothes in person."
2,Wrangler Jeans,"I received my jeans in reasonable time and the label on the jeans indicated they were a 28 inch inseam. However, when I wore them, they were dragging on the floor. I then measured them with a tailor's tape and the jeans inseam measured 30 inches. My wife will now have to correctly size them."
5,Worth it!!,"My son is over 6 feet tall and 300+ pounds and it is very hard to get a pair of jeans that fit him properly. Although this is a bit expensive for me as I have to get them shipped to South America, it's worth it! Will definitely buy more."
4,objective,"The jeans were a little more expensive than the walmart price, but Iwas able to get the size I wanted. That is important to me."
1,NOT the original 31MWZWK relaxed black jean,"If you are a long time Wrangler wearer, as I am, don't be fooled by these. I made the mistake of keeping the three pair I ordered even though it is obvious that they are NOT the same as the original 31MWZWK jeans. They felt pretty good, so I decided to give them a try. These jeans are thinner material, have a different label, and shrank in size right after I washed them. They don't have the rivet on the pockets and are generally cheaper in feel. Since these are the jeans that came up when I typed in 31MWZWK, I believed that that was what I was getting. I actually think that they might be a ""knock-off"" rather than the real thing. By the time I realized I no longer wanted them, it was too late to return them for a refund. I feel really ripped off."
5,Chitin-chitosan,"This book details the effectiveness of chitin-chitosan in assisting the human body's natural healing power to combat diseases and disorders that modern Western and Oriental medicinal have not been able to surpass and without the side effects. The chapters are broken down by pathologies and begins with an overview of the disease itself. Shortly thereafter, it takes you through the experiences of those who have taken chitin-chitosan as a supplement for their illness and how their health had improved within a short period of time. Then starts another chapter on another disease following the same outline. For those who are unfamiliar with medical terminologies, this book may be hard to follow at times. However, when they can, they try to explain them in laymen's understanding. Overall, I found the experiences and information in this book to be quite impressive. It is stressed that chitin-chitosan is fairly new in the medical field and is still under further research."
2,Don't wast your money,"Listen, this cd ONLY has 3 songs. ""Roll of the Dice"" (which sound like it was copy for his original cd), A live version of ""Leap of Faith"" (that why I gave it 2 stars). This song is great!! This was the only song listening to if you pick up the cd. The third song was all right. But save your money!"
5,Every Man Can Become a Man of God,"This excellent resource for every (any) man has helped me and my small group (men) grow in our Christian walk. There are principles covering all areas where we struggle. I read it four years ago, and I have quotes from it in my daily planner, on my desk at work, and in my Sunday School lessons - even to this day."
3,"Argument good, content moderate",I found some of the content a bit crude and included for the shock factor. I was considering using this book for a men's study but chose Disciples of a Godly Man by R. Kent Hughes instead.
4,A Hoot of a book!,"Hoot is an excellent book not only for Young Adult readers but for everyone. Hoot takes place in Florida, where the new kid in town Roy one day sees a boy running incredibly fast and without shoes.Roy one day follows this kid and what ensues is multiple plot twists, colorful characters, and even a little environmental plug in regards to the owls.Carl Hiaasen's first attempt at Young Adult fiction is a great success. The book is a page-turner for all ages, and has the ability to empower the young and the old. Read and enjoy"
5,Perfect Book for preteens and above! JKW,"This book is a captivating tale of Roy (main character), Dana (bully), the running boy a.k.a. Mullet fingers (the dangerous, adventurous boy), and Beatrice (the running boy's sister). This particular book describes Mullet Finger's mad attempts to save some small burrowing owls. He does everything he can to stop the Mother Paula's Pancake Company from building a Mother Paula's in Coconut Cove (their city) because of the owls living there. It tells the story of a boy's persistence, three strong friends, and a vice president that you will love to hate! This book is a MUST READ but I do not reccomend it to anyone younger than 10. 2 thumbs WAY up!"
5,"Its a ""Hoot""!","Roy Eberhardt has rescently moved to Florida. His first few days of school were a blur. Until one day on the bus Dana Matherson had Roy's head up against the window when he spotted a boy, running without any shoes, running as fast as he could past the bus stop way on down the street, not stopping for anything. Roy was very curios so after Dana let him go he ran off the bus at the next bus stop to follow the boy. Meanwhile a construction foreman was extremely puzzled as to what was happening. Read Hoot by Carl Hiaasen to find out what happens next!Hoot is a wonderful book to read, especially for people that like something besides love stories. This is a very adventurous book. You won't be able to put it down. I highly recommend it. It'll give you a ""Hoot."" Good Luck!"
5,A great read!,"This book was great! It was interesting and funny, and I really liked the way the author described the characters. They seemed like real people. I also learned a lot about burrowing owls. I never knew there was such a thing. I liked the way the kids worked to save them from the pancake house. I would recommend this book to all my friends because it was so good!"
3,Just ok,Not as great as advertized but not objectionable. A young person who likesto read will 'just' enjoy it no more.
3,"hoot says the owl, it's time to read the book.","Leaving his friends behind, being in a new school, and encountering new bullies, Roy Eberhardt has to endure everything a new kid has to. The thng Roy hated most was leaving the gorgeous mountains in Montana. Now he lives in humid, flat, Florida, in a town called Coconut Cove. But bully Dana Matherson and the running boy keep him on him on his guard instead of daydreaming for the mountains. When Roy encounters with the running boy and finds out about the burrowing owls, his life in Florida takes a turn. Saving the owls and trying to keep him, the running boy, and Beatrice, another friend out of trouble isn't as easy as it looks. Especially if his father works for the goverment, but saving owls from being buried alive from desperate pancake people is inportant. When time almost runs out, Roy must take matters into his own hands."
4,WOW and Amazing,"This book was just... to good for words. I never wanted to put the book down! If you read this book, I, Claire, can almost Garentee that you will like this book. My twin sister even liked it, and she HATES books!!!!!!! Read this and you won't regreatit!!!!!"
5,Ryan H.'s Review,The characters are realistic because they do the same things we would do.It is funny because an alligator pops out of the toilet and they get in fights also.It sounds like it could be a true story because real people would do the same thing Roy and his friends did.That is why you should read this book.
2,Be aware of swear words/hidden agenda,"My 9-year-old brought this home from the school library and upon reading it, informed me the word ""damn"" is used multiple times in the book. While it's not the most horrible thing in the world, I guess, teachers and parents should be aware it's in there. I'm puzzled as to why a children's book, and one that's apparently won awards, has swear words in it. Also, the synopsis on the book jacket described the story of a boy who moves to a new school and finds an unusual person to be friends with. However, my son told me the main points of the story were environmentalist in nature, coming out against a company developing land in Florida. While that kind of thing is something that should be discussed, I wish the synopsis had been more truthful. It's disappointing to see that there's some deception on the story description and then swear words once you get into it. Full disclosure is a good thing."
1,Hoot?,"In school, Hoot was a read aloud. It stunk. I got confused it made no sense people laughed at stupid things and it was unrealistic. I will see the movie almost as a scout and I will write a review good or bad, but I can tell you the book was stupid original and boring."
5,"Hoot, another great read!","Have not yet read a book of Carls I didn't like!Easy read, with laughter throughout and a great story to boot!"
5,Jaimie's Book Review,"Would you read a book about owls? But what if it was about a boy named Roy who teamed up with two people named Mullet Fingers and Beatrice, risking their lives trying to save an owls nest that's about to be destroyed because of a new company settling in on top of it? Well, that's what Hoot is about. It is truly the best because of so many things. One, the author writes in a certain mood and tone that makes you want to continue reading like an addicting drug. Second, this book is suspenseful. You have no idea who commited what crime. The only way to find out is to keep reading. Third, the characters are well detailed. For example, a character named Mullet Fingers is a talented and unwealthy boy who gets his name by catching mullets with his hands, however, his real name isn't revealed until the end. I enjoyed this novel to the fullest extent and I'm 100% sure that you will too."
5,Hoot Hoot Book,"I rated this book 5 star besaus,its a great book. Hoot as lots of misteries. One boy, A new house, a new school, a new friend,a new bullies,and even more problems. You should read this book!!"
3,Disappointing,"I purchased this book for my 10 year old animal loving son. The idea of endangered owls hooked me. I decided to pre-read the book to make sure it was appropriate for him to read. There isn't anything offensive in the book, but I thought it was kind of dull. I can't imagine my son enjoying this book. In addtion, I can't imagine my 8 year old daughter ever finding it enjoyable either. The very beginning is kind of intriguing, but after that it seems very predictable."
5,From a sixth grader...,"WOW! This is a great book that kept me intrigued and wouldn't let me put the book down. If you think about it, the plot is odd, and when I first read the inside cover I thought it was going to be a forceful read. Fortunately, I read it anyway b/c it was a Xmas gift and I didn't want the people who gave it to me to feel bad. :) Anyway, I reluctantly read it, and was surprisingly VERY pleased with the story. From the reviews I've read, it sounds like the children (like me) like it more than the adults. Maybe I'll get my parents' or grandparents' opinions...?AND FOR THOSE WHO ARE INTO READING THE SHORT AND TO THE POINT REVIEWS, IN A FEW WORDS, IT'S A GREAT BOOK, ESPECIALLY FOR KIDS, AND I'D RECOMMEND IT FOR >ANY< AGE GROUP! :)"
4,Good Message,"Well, I have to read this book for language arts, and its sending out a great message. Now lets be honest, how many of you knew that Burrowing owls are in danger (or even what they are)before you read this book (or seen the movie). Even thouggh it sends out a good message its still a good book to read.*it does have a little Profanity"
4,"Tricky at first, but then it's great!","This computer is a little tricky to figure out, and a little hard to mount, but once you get the hang of how to use it, it is really nice and convenient. I have learned to flip through the functions while riding and have learned how to clear it for each new ride. I would definitely recommend this product!"
1,Blacks out in hot weather,"I used one of these computers for a couple of years and although it worked fine most of the time, the real problem was in summer heat, where the entire display screen would turn black so I couldn't read anything. I first discovered this while on an 1,800 mile tour in Central America, where every day was near 100 degrees. It was almost useless on that trip, except in the mornings before it got too hot out. Later, I started experiencing the same problem others have reported of the contacts not making a connection. At first that would only happen when it rained, but later it did it even when dry out. I would avoid this one, unless maybe you just want to use it on a stationary bike indoors."
2,does not last long,"the computer started to malfuction after 4 months. it just keeps resetting, even after i changed the battery."
3,Good sword for the price.,"When i saw this sword i thought it was cool and cheap. But stupidly i didnt read the reviews, even though it got good reviews i realized it was just for looks. So when it got here (yesterday) i instantly started to inspect it. Dull. and bent slightly. so i started sharpening and tried to slice and orange. than a plastic bottle. than it kinda broke. the handle is loose now. so i put it back in the sheath and now im done choppping things with it. it was fun for a second but im just gonna put it in my room for looks. Definitly a good buy for $15."
2,Decoration Only!,"I imagine it should be obvious to most people but this sword is not meant to actually be used. It is for decoration purposes only. It may look nice and that is fine for most people but the fact is that there is very little about this sword that is authentic. More than likely it is machine made and sharpened. If you are looking for the real thing and not just an imitation I suggest looking at a different sword, maybe something from Paul Chen (Hanwei)."
3,For the money...,"Well it is great for the money. It is not stainless steel, or sharp, or strong. It does look great as a wall hanger or accessorizing a great Snake Eyes costume."
4,Good for the Price,"I think this sword is well worth the 15 dollars for it. I have many high end swords as well, but for the 15 dollar price range this is great. Its a stainless steel blade (which in most cases is much narrower than the handle making it look rather ugly) but is a good width. If you want to hang it on the wall, it'll look great but i actually use it to trim the garden. its nice to have a sword i can practice with and not worry about if it gets damaaged. if you find that it gets loose, remove the cam on the bottom of the handle and tighten the bolt."
1,Sword,Its not that bad but is made out of cheap mettle and when shipped the blade was half fallen off
4,Dead End review,This book was a good thriller to the end and it was a lot of sleuthing to find out how the murders were connected
3,It may be worth your time.,This serial murder story is readable and has characters with potential. It moves well even if the motive seems a little strained. I would read another with these characters.
3,"Average to good detective novel, yet lacked depth to put it into the greatness realm","A prototypical story, with average characters and a lack luster ending. The novel was good, but there as so many more out there that have done more with a lot less. Friedman's antagonist was weak and did not really fit the vendetta killing stereotype. If you like reading books that force you to try and put the puzzle pieces together and find out who is behind the murders before the next one happens, this is an average sample of the style. However, be prepared to be disappointed with the eventual lack luster climax. Average at best."
3,inexpected,"i purchased this album because bob thiele and gabor szabo with the california dreamers albums were excellent. both were on impulse records as was honeysuckle breeze. impulse needed something to back up a young very talented soprano alto tenor sax man, also flute in tom scott; so the california dreamers were selected. this album is more about displaying scott's versatility than the music. if you like improv jazz, then this album is for you. but, if szabo's ""wild sky and diamonds"" with the dreamers is your forte, stay away from ""honeysuckle breeze""."
5,My Six-Year-Old Loved It,"This is supposed to be an abridgement for young readers -- and on that count it works beautifully. In fact, the abridging is very well done: the story is detailed, well-paced, and very understandable for the youngest readers. Most importantly, the abridging editor preserved Mark Twain's moral: that an ""uneducated"" young boy is a better navigator through life than the corrupt adults by whom he is surrounded."
3,Its a classic text book for eCommerce,"Global eCommerce is a good text book for eCommerce. Its a text book in terms of the style its written in, tone, and level of insight. If you are looking for a broad based reference book then its OK. Otherwise there are better books (eProcess Edge, Customers.com, and others) that provide more detail insight and understanding."
3,Can't give it a rating,I have not used this product consecutively enough to be able to give any type of evaluation. I forget to take is many nights.
2,Worst Robin Cook book I've Ever Read,"The book is preachy. The characters are not credible. The plot is thin. The writing is horrible. By halfway through, I only wanted it to end. I finished it just because I didn't want the book to beat me. This was a total waste of time. Not at all up to the quality of past Cook novels, and not indicative of someone who has written so many best sellers. This was just published, but it reads like a new author's first novel. Stay away."
2,"Cook's ""Abduction"" should have been--abducted, that is.","I didn't read Amazon's reader reviews on this book until afterward, but they all seemed to mirror my own assessment of ""Abduction"". My first thought was 'Did he write this in high school or what?'. This novel was definitely not up to Robin Cook standards in comparison to his many wonderful medical thrillers. His characters were nothing short of juvenile in behavior, and his overuse of the word ""surreal"" in one chapter had me about ready to scratch my own eyes out! I think Dr. Cook had better give up science fiction and go back to doctors and hospitals, where he excels as a novelist."
1,A Famous Medical Author Simulates A Self-Frontal-Labotomy,"This novel tells the story of five people who are sucked into an undersea civilization very much older than our own. The plot hinges on two of the ""suckees"" - deepsea divers - acting like oversexed Neanderthals who become rapacious killers in a Utopia that knows no violence. The characters in this book are so unreal, their actions so inexplicable and ""far out,"" that the novel becomes laughable. The premise, the plot, and the characters are so cartoon-like that the reader weeps for Robin Cook; to think that a well-known author's gift is revealed as so thin and fragile. This book is a literary suicide. Avoid it!"
2,An amateurish offering from an old pro.,"I consider myself to be a Robin Cook fan. In fact, I put Abduction on reserve at the library before it had even arrived from the publisher. I was very disappointed. The story is silly, the characters are one dimensional(if that) and the writing is amateurish. I doubt that if this has been another author's first novel that it would even have been published."
1,Very disappointed!!,I agree with almost everything the other reviewers have said. The only thing that pleased me was that I didn't pay the full price for the book! Hopefully RC will read a few of these reviews and see the error of his ways. I am a great fan of him but this one was really bad!
1,"Disappointing, boring.","Can this book really have been written by the Robin Cook, whose previous books I have thoroughly enjoyed? The beginning of the story caught my attention, but soon dropped to readying quickly to get it over with. I sincerely hope that Mr. Cook will return to what he does best: writting medical fiction."
2,Disappointing,"Readers who have enjoyed Robin Cook's medical thrillers will be disappointed by this book. The setting updates a tired science fiction idea -- an inhabited world miles under the surface of the Earth -- without adding much of interest. The characters are not very sympathetic, and the ending is essentially a joke. One hopes that Cook will go back to biomedical themes, and that publishers will not print everything a famous writer puts out."
3,"Great Start, Poor Finish","Having read all of Robin Cook's books, I expected another wonderful read filled with suspense and explicit character development. This book failed those tests. The storyline was original, but halfway through the book, I found myself wondering why Cook failed to expond more on the questionable behaivor of his characters. The story could have gone a long way, but I found myself anxious to finish and get it over with. I recently read both suspense books by James Rollins and found those to be fantastic"
2,About 350 pages too long -- Trying to summarize other reviews,"Let me try to bullet point the other reviews.* This is science fiction -- not Cook's typical Medical thrillers* It would actually make a much better short story. (Atlantis Lives) It could be told very well in about 75 pages or a hour long TV show* The characters are fairly flat and one dimensional.* The plot, while not bad, is reminiscent of a 1950s twightlight zone, or 60s Star Trek episode. Its very straightforward and you can see where its going.* The ending twist was one I didn't find that amusing -- again, a decent short story conclusion, but not enough for a full novel.Saying that, the book isn't *that* bad. I think some reviewers might have been expecting something more in the lines of Cook's other works. I would give it a little more than 2 stars, but given the lenght it's closer to 2 than 3."
1,worst audio -cd i have ever listened to,"for the past 15 (at least years) i have listened to any number of audio cds and tapes (from Nancy Drew quality to higher) while i have been engaged in renovating an old house--- this is the first CD that i have put back in it's packaging to send off to the goodwill, unlistening to in it's entirity----- it is poorly written, as if it has been composed by a half-drunk in the 1950s who is stuck in some sexist/unimmaginative time-warp-=----"
2,Dr Cook is no Jules Verne...,"Perry Bergman, founder, president and largest shareholder of Benthic Marine is on its way on board the Benthic Explorer near the volcanically and seismically active Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Using the submarine Oceanus, the crew is working on their current project: drilling into a magma chamber within a seamount west of the Azores.One day, in the Oceanus, the crew come across a strange and deep hole that looks like an opening into an extinct volcano when suddenly the submarine looses its buoyancy and is inexorably sucked into the abyss. And so the members of the crew are about to enter the futuristic world of Inteterra.Jules Verne wrote an infinitely more refined book, ""Voyage to the Center of the Earth"", in 1864! Maybe Dr Cook should concentrate on what is his speciality: medicine."
1,Please tell me the other Robin Cook books are better!,"This was the first and probably last Robin Cook novel for me. I was disappointed after hearing so many positive comments on his medical thrillers. The ""fantasy world under the sea"" science fiction in this book lacked several components, including plausibility and interesting dialogue. Many comic book heros have more dimensions than the stock, predictable characters in this novel. A plot twist in the last pages is the only original idea in the otherwise stale material."
5,Creative and Fresh Sci-fi Story!,This was my first Cook book and I was thoroughly impressed by his unique and imaginative storyline. This book had surprises at every corner and has made me an instant fan. It was more a sci-fi story than medical thriller which made it even better than I expected. I'm almost finished with the book and sad that it's almost over. Now I'm looking for another Cook book that measures up to this one.
1,Did I Catch You Before You Bought This Book? I Hope So!!!,"This was the disappointment of my lifetime! Ok, that's a little harsh, but this was, without a doubt, the worst novel written by the master of medical thrillers. It's not a medical thriller, by the way. Issac Asimov comes to mind. I couldn't even develop a liking to any of the characters of this book. I am convinced that someone made a mistake when crediting the author of this novel. My 15-year old daughter could have done a better job. Mr. Cook, forget this silliness. I am afraid I will never purchase another one of your novels. Many say the ending was shallow, but I say the entire movel was. Please return to your proper genre. I wasted too much time and money. I almost threw it away, but was sure there'd be a twist that would get this novel on the right track. It never happened"
2,Close But No Cigar,"This is a poor attempt by Robin Cook to stray away from his typical medical thriller and try his luck at a Michael Crichton wannabe book but falls short.The subject has already been used before but nevertheless it is an easy read. But I think I might have read this book before I think it was called ""The Abyss"""
1,shallow,Cook should stick to his area of expertise - Medicine in his books. This science fiction adventure lacks the deep analysis & understanding of a theme that makes his medical thrillers so interesting.
2,Skip it !,"This novel begins and ends like a first-rate marine adventure, but the 90 percent in between isn't much worth the time it takes to read. The principals are abducted into a Utopian undersea society, at which point the story becomes a plagiarism of Aldous Huxley's classic 1932 novel ""Brave New World"". I'd advise reading the Huxley and skipping this one!!"
5,A Magnificent Masterpiece,"After reading the first book, I just had to go on. Once again, C.S. Lewis puts a magnificent tale in our hands. This is a tlae of two sisters and brothers who are living with an old professor. The youngest sister Lucy finds a _______ in a wardrobe while playing hide and seek. They then venture on amazing adventures even I cannot describe, so read this book yourself."
5,Michael Hague illustrations are just the best,Buy this for a loved one. Make sure you get Michael Hague's wonderful illustrations.
5,"The Lion,the Witch and the Wardrobe","Great fantasy book. It is a book for all ages, not just children. Really enjoyable to return to again and again."
5,David's revew for the lion the witch and the wardrobe,"In this book 4 kids wonder off in to a nother world threw there wardrobe. They meet alot of strange and unusual characters on there journey. En evil witch turnes alot of the characters in to stone and the kids help get them back. This book isnt realy like any of the books i've read befor. It seems more like a kids book with all of the crazy characters but, people of all ages could enjoy this book.On page 12 of the book, the quote,""How stupid of me! But Ive never seen a son of Adam or a doughter of Eve befor."" This quote kind of lets you know that there are not many humans in Narnia. They refered to humans as sons and, doughters of Adam and, Eve. this book also shows you that even though they are animals they can still talk in english. This is a good book if you like books with unusual characters in it but, i you like serious, or realistic books this is not for you."
3,An easy read. Good for Kids.,"I'm 21 years old and I picked this book up because I had never read it as a child and wanted to read it before I saw the movie. It is a very short book and I am pretty sure I read the book in less time then it took me to watch the movie. Most younger readers will not have a problem with this one and it is entertaining enough to keep them reading until the end.The story seemed kind choppy to me and there was very little character development. However, this is only the first of the chronicles of narnia and I've heard the the other books are better and since they involve the same characters there is bound to be more development. I think I might have just been to old when I read this book.If you're looking to get your young reader into novels then this might be a good introduction. Then they can continue with the rest of the series. If you're looking for something entertaining for your 14+ year old, this isn't it."
5,good read,this is a very good book and is well written. i have read this book multilplte times and loved it every time.
3,A Good Read,"I think other kids would like to read this because the characters were really believeable. The story is about four kids named Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy and they are sent to a foster house due to airaids in the war. There they find a magical wardrobe with a magical land inside it. What magical things await them in there?"
2,"Not a hard cover, not really!","Nothing about the story. Just the quality of this book is really bad, I won't call it a hard cover. Not really, really it is not! I am sending it back."
3,Hailey Turner,"This story was about four siblings, two brothers, and two sisters, findind their way through Narnia to help save their brother and to find Aslan. They wind up fighting in a huge battle and their chances to survive are slim. They are trying to defeat the White witch! They come head to head in a battle and have many obstacles to go through before they get so far. There are many mythical creatures in this book and it is very magicall.I rated this book a three out of five because this version left out a few things that were in other versions and I didnt feel the same way in this version as others. I am a christian though and I really like the fact that their was a christian scene, it was hard to understand but I knew what it meant. This book always makes me cry and I really enjoy this adventurous story. Overall I really love this story and think this is a great book that you can get caught up in and never put it down. I highly recomend it!"
1,Little Foot,I was very disappointed with this toy. The quality was terrible. The neck was very flimsy and it didn't hold the head up. I would not recommend this item to anyone.
1,Self-help scam,"As others have said, the message of this book could have been delivered in about two pages max. Granted, the premise is interesting, and I got some insights from examining how the 5 Love Languages play out in my own life. However, I did that BEFORE I read the book, based on a short review of it.The book itself is awful. It is superficial, anecdotal, opinionated, self-promoting drivel. It wasn't even worth the trip to the library, much less buying."
3,Five Love Languages,"Received order yesterday. Was very disappointed it was a MPG-3 formatt. Was under the impression that it was a regular CD that could be played in car, etc."
5,"Good Book, Great Help","A friend highly recommended this book to me because I am having marital issues with my wife and we're close to calling it quits. After reading the first three chapters I bought another copy to give to my wife to read. We both enjoyed it.We started counseling a couple of weeks ago and when I told the counselor we've read the 5 Love Languages, she was excited for us. She institutes a little bit of the book into our counseling sessions and used it as a baseline for our first session.The book showed me ways to communicate/love in a language my wife understands. It's teaching her that it's not helpful to us for her to keep bringing up past events and harping on the negative if we're to make our relationship work. The best part is the books gives real situational examples and teaches you how to judge your spouse without being judgmental."
5,TERRIFIC BOOK!,Our Pastor told us almost 15 years ago to read this book together and THEN he would marry us. OH my what a wonderful book this is and it has helped us understand each other in ways we would have never know before reading this book. I just bought it for my son and his girlfriend.. I recommend it to anyone.. Married or not married. It helps you understand yourself and your mate and what each of you need to feel loved.
5,Saved my marriage,"This book truly saved my marriage. I read it first and my husband chose not to read it. I left him and took a job out of state. He read the book just before I left but I was committed to taking the job. After he read it, we sat and cried together realizing how we needed to speak each other's love languages. We spent the next two years living in different states, but spent weekends and time off learning to love each other in ways that made the other feel loved. I quit the job after 2 years and he sold several businesses so we could spend more time together. We took our first real vacation of 35 years and have continued to spend quality time together since then. The past 3 years have been glorious even though we are experiencing many trial and tribulations from outside sources, we continue to strengthen our love within our marriage."
5,I wish I read this book 2 years ago (I am 22 now),"I am young, and I was in a serious relation. Unfortunately, I messed it up. Then I found this book, and now I understand a lot more and know how to love a girl with her language, I wish I read this book 2 years ago. It is really good and make sense, it is probably the most worthy book I ever read. No matter you have a wonderful relation or not, you should read it, it only help you make your relation better and understand your partner more."
5,Opened my eyes,"Throughout the book, references are made to the macro and micro workings of this ""organism"" that love is. These concepts truly incorporate the inner essence that married and single people ""ought"" to know by putting phrases in plain language anyone can translate and understand. The 5 Languages is a awesome concept, something that can be embraced by anyone of any background ANYWHERE."
5,Essential for Communication,"This is a book that I wish I would've never been in a position to come across, let alone read. However, I am thankful that I took the time and opportunity to do so wishing I would've been exposed and receptive to its message long before now. It has helped me to process communication in a totally different light. The references to couples the author worked with in the past really helped to explain each of the love languages. Also his way of referring objectively to either sex really made it easy to be able to see both sides points of view. This was helpful when elaborating on a specific language or explaining how to put it to use in day to day life. I was recommended to read this book and very thankful that I did. If you want to improve your ability to communicate to a loved one this is a must read."
5,Great Book!,I loved this book. I found it really helpful for me to understand myself and my husband. Once I started reading the book I immediately recognized my husbands love language. It took a little longer for me to learn what mine was. I now understand both of us better!
5,Best book ever,Easy book to read. I couldn't put it down. It made me realize so many things and why things might have gone wrong in marriage. Now to get my husband back!
4,"Simple Read, On Point","This book is great in providing an overview of the 5 important key elements in making a marriage work. Out of the five, each person has one that they hold of greatest value. This book helped me and my spouse find it. I just wish the author could have expanded a little more on why one element is more important to one person than to another."
2,There are no surprises,"This book is pretty predictable. I can't believe these ""help books"" have any value. The author seems very proud of his accomplishments. The problem with help books is they tell you what you already know, or can figure out if you think about it long enough. This is the first and last ""help book"" I will buy. This guy is making money off this book and I'm embarrassed I bought it. ""Five Love Languages"" is a pat book on how to solve your marriage problems and offers pat solutions that really seem forced and insincere. Really, the best thing is to get some counseling. There is no easy solution."
5,EXCELLENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I wish that this book would have been available when I was raising my children. I would have had a much better understanding of each of them. The information found in this book is so valuable. EVERYONE should read it. It will help parents understand their children. It will help married couples understand each other and will prevent the high divorce rate. I highly recommend that couples read before they get married. I have bought this book as part of the wedding present. Whether you are a newlywed or married for 50 years you will benefit from this book. It will enhance your marriage. PLEASE PLEASE BUY & PASS ALONG.
5,Eye Opener,This was a great book that really shed some light on what was wrong and needed to be changed in my marriage. It was an eye opener and I recommend to anyone that may be having troubles in any relationship but both parties need to read it for it to really be useful.
4,Love,Excellent book. Good audio book. I finished the book in about four running sessions. Very nice for seasoned married couples in need of support.
4,The 5 Love Languages: The Secret to Love That Lasts,"My friend introduced me this book. I ordered online and it was sent to me within a very short time. I read it and found it very interesting, inspiring and informative. It's worth to put into experiment, not only for a spouse but also for everyone else. I like the insight of it. Indeed, if we all ""speak"" the love language belongs to a spouse, a friend, or a co-worker the result will be harmony, sweet and happy.The 5 Love Languages: The Secret to Love That Lasts"
3,We aren't in 1970 decade,"I read this book, here in Brazil, about 20 years ago.This book was writen by an argetinian and jew, about thirty years ago.This book is against Argetina's government, in late 1970 decade.This book isn't a communist's book, but a book against torture and other bad things.The main problem of this book is that we aren't in 1970 decade.Argentina's processo is over since 1983 and we must remember that in Argentina, there was less than 0.05% of murders that were did in ""socialists paradises"" such as China or former USSR."
5,HILARIOUS!,"Nothing Sacred is a really funny movie. Carole Lombard is the perfect comediane and Frederic March makes a good transformation from his normal dramatic roles. This is a hilarious movie that no one should miss. Don't judge this one by the Lewis/Martin remake that is absulutely ludicrous! I liked the part where March is trying to make Lombard look like she has pnemonia so he punching her and stuff and says, ""I love you, (punches an ice pack off her head) I'm gonna marry you, and I don't want to spend my honnymoon blowing kisses to you outside the prison excersice yard!"" Or something like that. Watch this movie, you won't be disapointed. I must agree that Lombard would've made a good Lucy Ricardo."
1,Nothing Sacred,"The DVD case says the film is B&W. Unfortunately the DVD is technicolor. Video quality is blurry, washed out and unwatchable. I would have preferred a crisp B&W version. This version is a waste of time and money. Could not even finish watching this DVD because of the poor quality."
4,cool blocks,"They were cool, my daughter wasnt as excited as i thought she would be in the beginning but i have noticed shes playing with them more often. I purchased them for her 2nd birthday. Wish the blocks came in a reusable storage bin because the blocks are everywhere! I find the whole set when i organize her toys about once a month. I also wished they were slightly bigger because her little brother finds them and try to eat them and some are small enough to fit into his mouth even my daughter imagines them as play food. thumbs up nonetheless"
4,Box sucked,The box holding the box fell apart but the blocks very high quality an I would have given a 5 star but I was planning on using box as storage. Great buy
4,My Daughter & I can spend a lot time with it!,My three year old daughter really likes it - yes it is small & easy to knock over - but she & I find that to be challenging & fun! We spend at least 30-45 minutes building a project & she is always smiling & plotting her next move. She especially likes to knock them over when she is done.
4,Easy fun,Bought these for my son's first birthday. We sit and build together with them and he loves to play with them. It is helping his hand eye coordination. Perfect gift for my little builder.
4,little smaller but still very good,"the blocks were smaller than we anticipated, but our 2.5 year old still enjoys them. they are also initially very slippery, but once you play with them for a while they get better and it is easier to make taller towers. the overall quality is excellent."
5,Fabulous Blocks,"My 3 yr old got these from Santa and she LOVES them! They are a little small....so you don't make huge castles, but you get a good variety and they are a wonderful item! I recommend for any little girl or boy!"
4,Great size for little hands!,"Our pediatrician and several preschool directors recommended blocks as an imaginative learning activity before kids attend a more structured preschool environment. Block do make perfect sense and I've enjoyed seeing ""cakes"" and ""tunnels"" made throughout the day.Some pros and cons: this block set is small enough for toddler hands yet too many for parent-assisted clean ups; sturdy enough for building but small enough to where it's a bit painful when you step on them; great size for a two or nearly three year old but I suspect we'll have to search for bigger blocks when our toddler turns three.Overall, a great price for a big block set."
5,The Original and the Best,"This is by far my favorite album from Rainbow, hell, my favorite album in all of rock. Many will tell you that RISING is the best Rainbow album,and I totaly agree,RISING was the band at it's musical and creative peak and i love RISING but, i still preffer the warm magic charm of the debut album. Ever song here is pure musical genius, can't name a favorite because i love em all."
3,Charts the Evoulution of The Band,"I have been a fan of Level 42 since hearing 'The Chinese Way' back in the early 80's. For the casual fan, or someone starting to get into the group, this is an excellent CD to start of with. The good thing about this CD is that it charts the musical evoultion of the group. From the early brit funk hits of the fore mentioned 'Chinese Way', Love Games, and Micro Kids, to their big hit ( and the song that marked their cross-over appeal)'The Sun Goes Down (Living It Up)( which was produced by members of Earth, Wind & Fire), their period as a major pop band( Something About You, Leaving Me Now, the excellent, and I believe their first UK number one, Lessons In Love, & Running In The Family, and another one I really love,To Be With You Again) to the more out & out pop of cuts like ' It's Over', Children Say, Heaven In My Hands, Take A Look, Tracie,Guaranteed and Forever Now.For more Level 42 why not try the 1986 albumWorld Machine"
5,No easy roads on this ride.,"Once you start, you won't be able to put it down! And, you will get out your maps as well as study the history of the countries during the time of his amazing ride in 1925. It was disturbing to read that towards the end of his ride in the U.S. that drivers (even the few on the road at that time) purposely ran into him and his horses. Now I want to read his journey through Patagonia next."
4,The Third Heiress,"Good mystery,difficult to relate to values of the heroin.Books by Brenda Joyce are always a good choice. One of my favorite authors."
1,What happened to Brenda Joyce?,"I first would like to say that I was a true Brenda Joyce fan. For anyone who read ""Promise of the Rose"", you know what I am talking about. I love all types of romance ---comtemp. hist. funny. suspense, ect...Unfortunately, this book, ""The third Heiress"" did not live up to the hype. I felt no emotional involvement with the characters at all. There was nothing about Jill for me to want to read about! The mystery was lacking and I did not care for the whole ""Who am I"" plot line. It was played...so played! I know Brenda Joyce has written five star books before, I have read them. This book fell short. I hope she can lure me back with something better in the future."
1,Bad in every way,"If I could enter this review with NO stars, I would. I considered the writing to be totally formulaic and suspected the ending almost immediately. Jill, the heroine, was irritating and unbelievable. I agree with every bad review heretofore entered except the ones that liked any of it. I am angry that I wasted my money and time"
2,"Go back to romance writing, Brenda","Why do the really good authors of romance books feel a need to ""graduate"" to thrillers and mysteries? ""The Third Heiress"" is full of implausibilities, errors, and nonsense. Did any reader really think for one minute that Alex was the villain? For that matter, did any reader even care? Go spend your money on a good, old-fashioned romance. Please, Brenda, forget this new trend."
1,"Sorry, but I thought this book was bad!","To me, this book couldn't decide what genre it belonged in. Is it a romance, romantic suspense, ghost story, glitz? Who done it? I didn't care; the girl was long gone! Too many coincidences and stilted dialogue added to my dislike of this story. Then, there's the so-called love scenes; added I'm sure to give the author's fans a fair dose of her trademark sensuality. I'd pass on this!"
2,Unbelievable Plot,"Normally I love Brenda Joyce's work, having read all of her novels, but I was greatly disappointed with The Third Heiress.I felt the plot was too ridiculous to be believed. I wondered why Jill had such a fixation over Kate, and why she'd be so concerned with a possible murder from 90 years in the past.Throughout this never-ending book, I found myself thinking, ""Oh, please, let's be a bit realistic here!"" No one, but no one, would be so concerned with Kate and what had befallen her so long ago, and I also found it hard to believe that Alex would willingly wrap himself up in this ""mystery"" as well. More than likely, he'd have walked away muttering to himself.One major annoyance--""He stared."" ""She stared."" I was about to scream. Certainly Ms. Joyce can manage better than that.Normally a fast reader, I think it took me a week to get through The Third Heiress. I'd pick it up, read a few pages, then go find something better to do.I hope her next book is a much better read."
5,Bing and Friends,"I did not purchase this product on Amazon. However, My grandmother who loved music and was a professional musician, owned this very CD. In her later years when she lived with us we listened to Bing Crosby and Some Jazz Friends frequently. It never failed to bring smiles to our faces. You can hear the playfulness and smiles in the singers voices. I highly reccomend this CD. Even if you aren't a fan of Jazz I bet you will enjoy this music."
4,Shoe for players with fallen arches,"I had googled basketball shoes for players with fallen arches. Several options came up. Im an old guy who doesn't want to give up.I also have a bad ankle. So I put on my ankle brace and my knee braces, and my new T-Mac shoes with orthotic inserts inserted in them.I have been able to run the court pretty well with my new shoes. I think they have helped."
4,Great funky album.,"this album is great for it's fun vibe, it is a little sloppy inparts (but, i have heard Fuzz before, and expected as much).This is a much better album than FAR IN (although that record had better artwork and a better record title).Almost every song is fun and listenable.I love throwing it on in the background and just letting the album loop over and over all day on a sunny summer day.If you enjoy fun music, and want to hear a good funky record;look no further."
5,"Great, but not as pictured","The book itself was in good condition, It was received ahead of the time projected. But it wasn't the book pictured, it was one from the 70s. I'm not too upset, I was just hoping to finish out my collection as the series all looking alike. Otherwise it was great."
4,Another Great Little House Book,"I didn't get into this book as quickly as the others, but it is still a great part of Laura Ingall's life!"
5,Sharlene's Review,"This book is about a girl named Laura. Laura was standing at the doorway when she saw a wagon coming up the road; Laura never saw the wagon before. The wagon was Aunt Docia. She just wanted to tell Pa that Uncle Hi needed help at the store, because of the guys who were working on the railroad. So Pa said that he would go with Aunt Docia and Ma, Mary, Laura, Carrie, and Grace would come on the train when Mary got strong enough. She was blind. Ma and the girls went by train to a little depot. Pa was not there yet to pick them up. But he got there after supper. Early the next morning they were all in the wagon and ready to go, to Sliver Lake. Pa built a little shanty by Sliver Lake. One day Pa was hunting and found their homestead. Will Pa get the claim? I really liked this book, because it was non fiction and about Laura and Mary. I recommend this to all readers, because it entertains you and it is interesting."
3,yep,"I have to disagree with the reviewer who said that there was no connection whatsoever between Bukowski and Celine. I think fans of Bukowski will certainly like this book, and it is very clear Bukowski was influenced by Celine's prose. The difference is that Celine tends to be far more pessimistic and full of hatred for everyone, but he is also more poetic in his observation."
2,oral-b humming bird flosser review,"the battery that came installed in the product was corroded. as a result, the product is non functional as it was damaged by the chemical secreted from the baterry. i recommend when packaging the product, do not preinstall the battery.one of the floss head came with a broken thread.better quality checks should be perform before the product is placed on the retail market."
2,"Great Flosser, Poor Manufacturer Support","This little flosser is great, while it works. My son got one and for the 3 or 4 months it worked it was great. When it stopped working (yes, I tried a few new batteries) I contacted Oral B (owned by P&G. They were kind enough to send me a coupon for free floss. They said the Hummingbird was in this group. No one sells it anywhere around. Ever try to use a Mfg. coupon online? It won't work. I contacted them about it and they said they were sorry, but they couldn't send anything but the coupon."
1,"Lets Read Hebrews 13:5, 1st Timothy 6:10 and Matthew 6:19,20","Hebrews 13:5 Says: Let your manner of life be free of the love of money while you are content with the present things...1st Timothy 6:10 Says: For the love of money is the root of all injurous things...Matthew 6:19,20,21 Says: Stop storing up for yourselves treasures upon the earth where moth and rust consume...Rather store up for yourselves treasures in heaven...For where your treasure is, there your heart will be alsoWith such words like these being found in the bible--do you honestly think that god wants you to be focused on being wealthy? Why not be focused on learning the truth about GOD?Bryank@worldinter.net"
4,Not bad!,"Not a bad alternative to live or frozen. Less messy and convenient, and fish seem to like these as treats."
5,good price,cheap add on item for super saver shipping that my fish enjoy eating so i couldn't NOT buy it. i would recommend this to anyone with fish. they will love it
4,"Great product, didn't quite work for me...","I thought this would be a nice treat for my fish.Unfortunately, my fish are 2 medium sized Oscars.Don't get me wrong, they loved this product. However they are so large that it was a huge hassle for them to eat and they made short work of this container. And this issue is no fault of the company.The only complaint I had was that when it got to me about half the container was crushed tiny bits almost borderline dust. These pieces were way too small for really any fish to eat so once the full-sized ones were gone I had to throw the rest away."
5,Fish Love it!,"Great value, Fish love it! Easy to feed! Full container. What more can I say about this product? it works just fine!"
3,Happy ending obvious,"Just in case you haven't read this book, I put some spoilers in this review.Although you generally know that Spencer's books will turn out happily, this one made it way too obvious way too early.And it really didn't seem like anyone in the town or in the Catholic Church was all that upset that Sister Regina ditched her vows (albeit with a lot of thought and prayer). Just seemed like no one thought about it at all. OK, nun one day, wife a little bit later, whatever. I was raised Catholic, and I can tell you that in my home parish, that type of thing happening would have been gossip fodder for weeks.And frankly, the wedding night at the end was kind of creepy to me. Can't quite pin down why, but it just came off as weird.A nice light read, but I've liked some of Spencer's other books a lot better."
4,Book on tape,I listened to the book the first time and currently in the process of reading it. I am so sad that Lavyrle is ending her career as a writer. I hope that she will consider coming back and writing more. Her books hold your interest and keep you riveted to the pages. If you don't come back - thanks for the moments you've given us
4,Great end to a wonderful career,"In LaVyrle Spencer's last book before retirement, she brings you back to 1950 Bowersville, MO. Eddie Olczak's beloved wife Krystyna has just been killed and he and his two daughters are mourning her death. Eddie turns to Sister Regina, a nun battling her own problems.Although Sister Regina would love to comfort Eddie and his two daughters, Holy Rule forbits any contact. She battles with her feelings and her feelings toward Eddie. This is a book less about romance and more about soul searching.Always a fan of Ms. Spencer, I found this book to be a good end to a great career. We'll miss our beloved LaVyrle!"
1,"""The Sound of Music"" with no singing.","My first LaVerle Spencer novel, and perhaps my last, Then Comes Heaven was shallow, trite and predictable. Only past praise of the author by a couple of respected friends kept me reading to the end, hoping all the while it would improve. Alas, it did not. It's ""The Sound of Music"" with only two children, LOTS of Catholic guilt, and no singing. If it was possible to give it no stars, I would."
3,This set is not what you think...,"If you're a big fan of Laurel and Hardy,like I am,then don't bother with this.If you're looking for their solo work,it's already available elsewhere and probably better quality.When is it that companies are going to start releasing the shorts they did for Hal Roach and quit recycling the same old thing all the time??I would love to see the box set that was released in Britain last year or year before released over here.It has everything the Boys ever did,including the foreign versions! How come we don't get that??Don't we deserve that at least?? Buyer beware:Some copies,like this one, might be transferred from VHS and not digitally remastered.You deserve better!"
1,The Case Prevents Recharging...,"This phone case did not work for the Motorola KRZR K1 Blue (Unlocked). The case covers the battery charging area of the phone, thus rendering the case useless as the phone cannot be charged with the case on!I do not recommend this item."
3,Disappointing Nam Novel,"I have been reading Nam novels since I got out of the Army in 1977. While this is a good look at the devotion to duty and fearlessness of the LRRPs there was very little action in the book, although raining the arty down on the valley full of gooks near the end was awesome. I guess I just prefer books with lots of good firefights in them. I found Charlie Mike and The Last Run to be much better than this book."
4,Excellent! 4 stars!!!!,"This was without a doubt the pinnacle of Steve Vai's guitar playing. His technical skills alone have been the Holy Grail of guitar playing, his technical skill unbelievable. Never has the world seen a greater guitarist. Jimi Hendrix: no! Jimmy Page: UGH! Tony Iommi: never heard of 'im, just give me old Steve Vai, the best guitarist ever! Like I said, his technical skill is beyond amazing: his lightening fast trills and tapping is mind boggling. Being a guitarist in my band, I try to copy his sound every day, but no one can do it like ol' Stevie. I, like him, prefer soloing to playing chords, and my solos are getting more like his everyday. But back to Stevie, he is the original guitar god!"
4,all for one...,"I bought this CD because I'd heard the beautiful version of Into My Arms by Nick Cave on Pandora Radio. It is thankfully full of gems, however. The artists on this disc really connect with the work. It is mostly bare bones beautiful art."
4,Does exactly what I wanted,"Purchased this fan to provide a personal breeze that would not chill others close by. It works perfectly! It is large enough to provide me with a cooling breeze and small enough not to bother other, more cold natured folks. I would not, however, recommend it for a room-cooling fan unless the room was fairly small. My 8' x 10' office is about the largest room in which it would be effective."
2,"Noisy, Noisy, Noisy","I recently bought the Honeywell HT800 at Walmart and actually heard it running before I bought it. It didn't sound very loud in the store probably because there were other fans running nearby. However, at home in a quiet bedroom it is not satisfactory at all. I am currently online looking for another fan to purchase. I will probably give the Honeywell to my husband to use in his shop."
3,Too much noise for so small a fan,This fan is powerful but way too noisy for everyday always-on use in your room. The loud noise is distracting enough to make me turn it off for the night.
5,Love this fan,I bought two of these fans and I love them. The only thing that I whish it would do is turn downward. It will only stay strait ahead or up. But even with that I am happy with them. I didn't think they were to loud like some did. They have good air flow and push out a lot for a small fan.they are nice and sturdy.
3,small and powerful,"nice fan, works well and lots of power. a little too noisy to sleep with, but a good buy for the price"
3,"Doesn't move that much air, and can be loud for some","I've had this fan for about 3 years now. As far as small fans go, it is extremely loud. It is almost as loud as the large box fans, even on the lowest setting. I personally don't mind the noise because it lets me sleep, but I've been in a hot climate for the past few months now and the performance of the fan has decreased tremendously. Since the fan itself seems to be functioning correctly, I must just not have noticed it before when it was blowing colder air; however, now that I'm in a hotter area and really need a fan to help cool down, I can barely feel any air flow, even on the highest setting (which I tend to avoid because it sounds like a jet flying over my room). I have tried other fans and they work much better, so I recommend not getting this fan. On top of that, it only rotates vertically (manually), so there is no button to press to have it spin back and forth to cool down the whole room."
4,"Just like others claim, it's a bit loud...","Yes, it is a bit loud, but for $9.99, it definitely does the job that it's supposed to do. I sit in the corner of my office building, so it's real tough to get the building's air conditioning fully circulating through... I plug the fan in and keep it on my desk, and turn it on when necessary. I find myself turning it off for phone conversations because of the noise, even on it's lowest setting, but it REALLY moves air, which is why I bought it.You can easily read other reviews about the performance of this fan on its lowest setting, so I'll tell you about the highest. I've only used it once, and it blew everything off my neighboring cubicle's desk. A fan is meant to keep you cool. This one will definitely do the trick."
3,Too noisy,"I mean seriously, this thing is loud even at the lowest speed! The fan blades are of low quality too and its a chore to try to dismantle it for cleaning.Positive side: its light weight and cheap. Good if u're not using it when trying to sleep (outdoors and patios etc)"
3,"small and loud, but well built and effective","even on the lowest setting, the fan is quite loud. powerful, sure, but a lower setting would have been appreciated. it's not a good model, as it's too large for a desk, but too small otherwise."
2,Wonderful Artwork but not worth your hard earned cash.,"I love that this attempt to milk MLP fans for all their worth comes complete with new artwork on the cover that actually reflects the contents, but seriously, do we need another DVD of the same episodes that are in the box set? I sincerely doubt it. Although this DVD may be a low cost way to relive some of our cherished childhood it does not justify the expense particularly when most DVDs created today have at least four episodes per disc.Maybe they should have focused on creating new artwork for prints instead of creating new DVDs of the same thing. I do not suggest you buy this item, sell out the cash for a copy of the First Season instead it will save you money."
2,MLP 1986,"My 3yr. old loves My Little Pony, so I bought this DVD...She asked me to turn it off because it was scary. I also, was disapointed when I got it in the mail and saw that it was made in 1986 and on the descrition it said 2006."
5,Wonderful!,"Ella Fitzgerald's voice is like hearing elements of a waterfall, it sounds so crystal clear yet there is a twinkling sound there too. Anyway, the quality of the CD is excellent so if you are an Ella fan, then this CD is for you."
2,Star Knight Not So Bright,"I bought this DVD after thinking about it for a few weeks and was not expecting much,.. and basically that is what I got out of it. This movie must have been filmed in Spain a number of years ago. It was funny like a Monty Python type of movie. Harvey Kitel must be willing to appear in almost any type of film. The quality was really poor, the Alien and his Dragon spaceship I suppose were different from recent Alien movies I watch, he was a spaceman who resembled David Bowie. It was really a dumb movie. If you are not expecting a blockbuster movie and really like spanish directors, actors, producers and scenery, and please do not compare with any King Authur Knight movies,... check it out, like I say it is like a Monty Python movie."
2,Overated,"It is a good workout out, but I wouldnt call it insane, and I'm only in moderate shape. I've been doing it for a few weeks now and havent noticed any real changes, but I think it'll be better when I start suplementing with other workouts. Also one of the DVDs was missing (the plyometric cardio something or other) and it also didn't come with a body fat checker that I'm pretty sure it advertised in the description which forces me to give it a worse review than I normally would."
1,Boring,"Maybe I was spoiled by having seen the TV show first, but this movie (which inspired the TV show) was remarkably slow and dry. And the two main actors were weak. Wished I didn't waste the evening on this.The TV show, on the other hand, was delightful. I was really disappointed it got cancelled before the end of its first season. I recommend finding the TV episodes and watching those."
2,Sorry to be the contrarian,"The movie was fun at first, a light hearted glimpse of India with some commentary about America as well. By about half way through the movie, it turned cheesy, then just kept getting cheesier. Lines and interactions between the characters became predictable. The dialog was the same quality as mediocre television programming. At the very least, it could have remained wholesome, but it lost that too."
5,"Simple and funny, I guess that's all we need.","A movie about an American executive who was working at an a firm that is outsourcing its call center to India. His duty was to go to India and train the Indian staff there and make them understand the American culture to be able to service American customers efficiently. He meets an smart Indian girl there and falls in love with her.The movie was fun and entertaining. I liked it a lot, and I guess one of the reasons why I liked it was that I actually visited Mumbai before and kind of related to the movie. I was watching it on the airplane and had quite good laughs."
3,Fun Watch,"Outsourced is a great movie! its fun and educational at the same time. You learn about culture shock, economics of a globalized world and how one man deals with it all. India is portrayed quite originally, much better than say in a Slumdog Millionaire. Acting is great! The love story does seem kind of forced though, but I guess it wouldnt be a romantic comedy without romance in it. The biggest take away for me though, was the idea that you have to open yourself up to a culture for it to open itself to you."

Maybe Mandy shouldn't of ended her career. Maybe, she didn't deserve a greatest hits album. But, somethings wrong. 8 CD singles and 14 tracks on this CD. Plus, it would have also been nice to add new songs. Also, it would have been really cool to add Crank It Up."
5,Excellent Reading for Single and Married Women,"This book was an excellent guide as to how to prepare yourself for your ""Knight in Shining Armor"", according to God's words. It was easy to read and very helpful when trying to find out who you are as person, before you can know how to have a mate. I recommend that all single and engaged females buy this book.-Amali"
3,Foreign language title,"The book itself is fine. Multiple copies were ordered for my senior citizens' German class, and one of the members already had a copy, so we knew what we were ordering. Hemingway's style is simple and clear, as is the translation into German. Just be aware that if you are forced to order through Amazon, you pay the full handling and postage charge per item. That is, for 10 identical and very small paperbacks - a parcel measuring 14 inches by 8 inches by 2 inches - we paid the exorbitant postage and handling charge of 129 USD for the books to be sent to Australia!!! When I brought this massive overcharge up with Amazon, the reply was very much 'take it or leave it'. I wonder if Amazon doesn't have enough competitors? Interestingly, the books actually came from The Book Depository, but when I went to TBD website (twice) to try to order it direct from them, the book didn't show up. I can only wonder about that..."
5,Wordsworth: Poet of Anxiety,"I entirely disagree with the prevailing reviews on The Prelude. We have no other secular poem about the futile search for meaning in a meaningless world so fine as the Prelude: it is the Paradise Lost of those who search or long for a fleeting significance. What is significant about the poem is not that we believe what Wordsworth claims about the power of nature and the mind, but that he tried so hard to search out some sense of meaning and order- Wordsworth is the first Modernist writer before there was a name for his anxiety. This edition is wonderful in the way that it presents the 1805 and 1850 versions on opposite pages- it also contains the 1799 version- a real tour de force. Read The Prelude, read it carefully and take it too heart- there is no Song of Myself without Wordsworth's humane yet Promethean quest for significance."
3,Hmmm...,"This book was very enjoyable and entertaining but Sheila Copeland disgusts me with her love of perfection and her overly obsessed mentions of ""her"" favorite colour. If you can't take this book...don't even begin to read Chocolate Affair. Sheila also tends to make her characters too perfect and almost unrealistic with little flaws if any at all."
5,Great Game,"This game is filled with great graphics, handling and everything you could want in a baseball game. so go grab your hot dog and sit down to play this game just like sitting in a stadium!"
5,"Genius, Pure Genius.","Absolutely top draw. Mother's Pride have reeled off some of my favourite tracks and this is up there with the best. Floribunda was pumpin', but this offers far more. If you're in the mood to dance or sit back and absorb, this tune is quality. A vastly under-rated track that keeps growing on you the more you listen to it. Well worth the money!"
4,Very Good Item,Purchased these mints as a good alternative to that extra cup of coffee. Excellent if you are on a long drive and don't want to stop for another cup o' joe.
4,Comfortable,"I use this for spinning class, I no longer have sore seatbones. It does slide back a little so make sure you tighten it to the max."
3,Doesn't fit all Schwinn bikes,Be careful and measure your exercise bike seat. This is a narrow seat and most exercise bikes are bigger.
5,"""Rusty gears of morning.......""","To me, this album is like being caressed by a summer breeze on a warm and sunny day in the halcyon days of childhood. I bought it completely unheard on the recommendation of a friend, put it on in a dimly lit room at night, and was utterly transfixed from the first note to the last. Sam Beam sings with such quiet feeling and his lyrics evoke the decaying grandeur of the old genteel South. Parallels can definitely be drawn with Elliott Smith's Either/Or and Nick Drake's Pink Moon, though this album is a lot more lo-fi (which in my opinion adds to its charm). An astonishing and highly recommended debut."
3,"consistent, to a fault","I like this album, there really isn't a bad song on it. Unfortunately, there really isn't any song that jumps out to the forefront either. Its mellow, folky, introspective, bittersweet- all those adjectives used in previous reviews. But its hard to tell when one song ends and the next begins. But its really nice to turn the lights down and nurse a couple Guiness."
1,Do yourself a favor and don't buy this CD,This CD got the record for the quickest play in my cd player. I pretty much hated this CD right from the beginning. If you are looking for something to put you to sleep at night then this is the one for you. It seemed like Sam Beam kept playing the same chords over and over again for every song. I also found his lyrics to be a little outlandish at times. I actually read a review that put him in the same category as Elliot Smith. That is so far from the truth. Do not fall for that trap. I am glad that I actually downloaded all of the songs before I purchased this CD. I wouldn't have been this easy with my review if I actually paid for this album. Iron and Wine should be named Iron and 3 bottles of wine because you need to be drunk to listen to this.
3,Alarm Call - not what I expected,"I ordered this box set of singles hoping for the typical surprise of how many ways Bjork can make one song sound so diverse. I was impressed with almost every remix, but my biggest problem with it, is that it was censored! The line, ""I'm no f***ing Buddhist"" was dubbed over in 8 of the 9 remixes. Since that is one of the more powerful lines in the song, the remixes were partially ruined for me. The ""Alarm Call"" video was amazing. Bjork was at her finest, with her sexy scary moves. I enjoyed the video the most, even though it was also censored."
4,Hellacopters - 'Soulseller' (White Jazz),"Another two track CD single by Sweden's own garage rockers the Hellacopters. Whew! Talk about pricey! However, I will give credit where credit is due - I liked the title track ""Soulseller"" (3:14) but I was really impressed with their rousing cover of the Dead Boy's cover ""Ain't Nothing To Do"" (2:49). I'm thinking, if they haven't already done so, some label will likely include this and other rare + unreleased tunes on a great compilation CD some day. I remember - maybe ten years ago, these guys played in a dive in my town and you were lucky to find a vinyl 7"" in an area record store for like around $8 or more. Glad their music is (now) easier and much more affordable."
1,Never Buy These Kinds Of Set For These Outrageous Prices,"You can buy these movies, All in one set , Much CHEAPER than the $60.00 that is shown here. Save your money and get more for it."
2,not for everybody,"this is one book where the movie was better.however, i always like to read the book to get the actual details. this book is over 500 pages .it is very detailed , but not a page turner."
4,Good but weird ordering of materials,"I am surprised no one has ever written anything about this book.I bought the book about 2 years ago in addition to book by Farlow. I have used Farlow and Colton for primarily learning the subject and used Strauss more as an ""Excercise Book"".I prefer to follow other books and visit this one on a topic-per-topic understanding instead of following chapter to chapter ordering in this book. Chapter 1, 2, 3 is quite the good materials. However from 4 on, the subject material order is a little weird."
4,Lois Remembers,"Excellent book by wife of cofounder of AA. The vendor did a good job describing the book, it's content and description and sent it in a timely manner."
2,One of Alice's weakest.,"Alice's vocal performance on this album is great, as are the lyrics. But the music is very dull, incorporating way too much Industrial-style influences and simple mashing of one-note power chords. This is one of only 2 or 3 Cooper albums I don't like."
2,Battery drains really fast,"i charged this thing for about a day, next day, used it for about 5 minutes and the battery was all drained."
2,not good at all,"i am really disappointed with this item, i live in malta, and the mains charger we use over here is eu type 3 pin plug, and same came us type 2pin flat,besides, same drill is not charging at all, after giving it 16 hours, and the little it charges, it is not worth as a screw driver,i have paid for it a lot of money through dhl, but it is not worth a cent, if i could give 00 rating i would becouse it would really suit this drill,i am really disappointed."
4,good drill just lacking some power,"I was stoked to see this drill was delivered befor the delivery date, and i had a small project to tackel asap. I only needed to drill some screw set holes for a table i was building around a fishtank, well the drill tried but didnt make it through the 32 holes needed. good drill but lacking power"
1,"Worthless, avoid at all costs.","This was awarded to me as an employee reward for five years' service. Nice to know they value me LOL. I used it once - and as others noted, it has no power and is awkwardly balanced. Put it away for a few months, then needed it for a little project. Won't work, won't charge. When you plug the charger in there is no indicator light, and the suspicious instructions anticipate your problem as they suggest if it isn't charging try another socket. Well, won't charge in three working outlets. Guess it is a doorstop now. Too bad, B&D used to be at least decent. Never again. Under warranty which is a joke because it would cost more than it is worth to mail back, which is B&D's scam."
3,Stand,"My only problem is what i want to do with it it would need to have a stand and it doesn't, if you have one feel free to let me know so i could purchase.Terril"
2,Not what I thought,I bought this refurbished. It would not hold a charge that long and trying to drill holes in my entertainment cabinet drained it in no time.
1,Actually 1 1/2 stars...better than the first,"What can I say? Slightly better than the first, still trite, still predictable...and geez, I was a Roberts groupie at one time.Suggest readers read the Born In series or Chesapeake trilogy.I'm halfway through Key of Valor. Most likeable female lead character out of the bunch."
2,The middle is always the hardest,"This was a so so book sofar as a middle book goes. I can't say I felt anything for Dana and Jordan...I felt that Dana was too angry to like, but other times she seemed weak. Dana especially showed this regarding Jordan. I have to say I like Flynn and Mal better than Jordan and Dana. Dana was to pessimistic to like....I am just reading the beginning of Key of Valor and Zoe so far has made up for Dana."
5,Great book about the Sabbath,This book is well done and I highly recommend it. I've bought and passed out quite a few. Each arguement against Saturday Sabbath is well dealt with by the Bible. The book was well put together and thought out. If you want to understand what the Bible says about Saturday Sabbath and how through history the Saturday Sabbath has been kept you should buy this book.
3,"Looks nice, but too small","I love that this matches my bathroom, but even fingertip towels are too large and hang down to touch the vanity, which looks sloppy. It's not very functional-much smaller than I thought it would be, but I do keep it out I just double fold the towels so they dont hang down too far and hope no one touches it. I wish I would have looked closely at the measurements. The quality is nice though, these are hard to find in this finish."
4,Very Good Beginner's Book...But,"There is a real emphasis on peanut butter and peanut products in the recipes. About 1/3 of the recipes have peanuts! If you have a child or children with peanut allergies, this is not a very useful book, although I might try some of the recipes with other nut butters substituted for the PB."
5,"Superb, and great sound.","This is an excellent recording, obviously mastered by some masterful recording engineers. My only wish is that I could've been in the recording studio or dance hall myself, but this is about the next best thing. Duke Ellington I adore and will forever, but this selection puts jazz band music in a whole different perspective. Smoke is coming out of my speakers. The whole house is shaking. The roof is buckling. Don't say you weren't warned!"
5,CD,I love Denean and this is 1 of my top 3 albums they produced. The flutes and Native American sounds are most relaxing.
4,Excellent,"A fine biography by a fine writer. The reader's interest is immediately engaged (at least, mine was); it is a very well researched work with many interesting and little-known details about the subject. I highly recommend this book for those readers interested in historical biography and history in general. It's well worth the cost and is a excellent addition to one's personal library."
3,George Washington Light,"When I decided to embark on a presidential biography reading journey, I decided to start with numero uno. The thing is, in less than 250 pages, you get the ""George Washington for Dummies"" version. It's a well written book. Mr. Ellis cannot be described as a poor author, but I wish he had written this book for the more hardcore biography and history buff. There was very little written about the relationship between President Washington and his wife, very little on the tense environment in the cabinet etc. Put it this way, I'm waiting for Chernow's Washington biography to come out in October for I feel that I cannot continue reading all the biographies without having a more solid read on George Washington. If you have never read a Washington biography, wait for Chernow's to come out. Trust me."
2,A Huge Disappointment.,"Ellis is a great author, and he did a good job of giving us a nice overview of Washington's life and accomplishments. Unfortunately, Ellis made it his mission to ""dispel the myths"" surrounding Washington and prove he is a mere mortal after all. I have no problem accepting the fact that Washington was human, but I was disturbed by Ellis' attack on his character. Every noble accomplishment that Ellis chronicled was followed by a negative attack on Washington. I think it unfair to say that Washington was more interested in own reputation than the good of the nation.Washington's life speaks volumes for the kind of man he was, and the belief he had in a great United States of America. It will take a lot more than a misguided author to change that."
4,Just Short of Excellent,"Joseph Ellis has written a solid short history of the life of the greatest American. However, should the reader have time, or the inclination, for only one current book on George Washington, I strongly recommend Washington's Crossing by David Hackett Fischer over His Excellency. In Ellis' hands Washington is strangely lifeless with his eye always on his future reputation. By contrast, General Washington comes alive in the more focused effort by Professor Fischer."
4,Amazing History,Ellis' book makes the life of Washington come alive. The narration on the CD is well done. Worth your time!
2,Lightweight at best!,"Our founding father deserves a proper biography. Unfortunately, this isn't it. This book is nothing more than an expansion of Ellis's earlier book, Founding Brothers. One can only surmise that Ellis wrote this book to make money. I hope that a serious historian will someday tackle Washington instead of a hack like Ellis."
3,"Interesting, but Disappointing","I purchased Ellis's work on the recommendation of a co-worker. He assured me I would like it; I ultimately found the book interesting, but disappointing. For the casual student of history, ""His Excellency"" provides an fine entrance into the world of Washington that helps gently brush away folklore and brings into focus the man qua man. In the end, however, Ellis leaves serious inquirers wanting more as he leaves his thesis question unresolved. What makes Washington the ""Foundingest Father of them all"" (p.xiv)? ""His Excellency"" doesn't provide a clear answer."
4,An Enjoyable Read,"I enjoyed this book detailing life and times of George Washington. I especially enjoyed reading of the events that created dissatisfaction within Washington regarding England's policy of hemming in colonial expansion to the west as well as his perception of England's unfair trade practices with the colonies. I'm always interested in learning when those first seeds of revolution begin to germinate in the mind of each of the founding fathers, and this book does not disappoint."
3,Superficial,"His Excellency hits the high points of Geo. Washington's life but lacks substantive detail. For example, in the attempt to raise a standing U.S. army, Ellis notes that Alexander Hamilton is made second in command -- but provides no background other than Hamilton was an aide-de-camp to Washington. Reading Ron Chernow's Alexander Hamilton fleshes out the very close relationship between Washington and Hamilton. I'll be looking to Flexner's biography to really understand the man who was George Washington."
5,Very Analytical,"This book not only gives the information that is so important to understanding the man that was George Washington but also gives the reasons and the life experiences that shaped them. A great, manageable read."
1,Memories of Comrads in Arms,"Not at all like advertised. No real combat footage or drama. Feelgood stories of young marines who fought and lost close friends, came home and, with loved ones, talk about it. There is far more action documented on youtube. Simply not what I purchased it for."
3,Beginner's intro to the spiritual ideas of the Craft.,"This book was a breeze to read, and maybe a bit too simplistic for me. I think it would be good as an introduction to the kind of spiritual and moral ideas one finds in Freemasonry, and to some of the debates of whether or not it is a ""religion"", and what that might mean. It might warm a beginner up to the idea that there is a more esoteric side to the craft as well, but does not go into this in any detail."
3,"If your kid can count to 10, don't bother with this one...","I was hoping for a Leap Frog quality DVD on numbers- this wasn't it. There was lots of counting to 10 and only one small scene where they go beyond ten into the teens. 1-30 would be more helpful I think, but even that would have been kind of lame. I would only recommend this video to very young kids- 2 or maybe 3 year olds. Even then, you'd probably be better off just counting Cheerios or stuff around your house. There isn't any ""math"" and the story itself is slow and, frankly, boring. My kindergartener loves all her other Leap Frog DVDs, but never asks to watch this one. Why would she?"
3,Enduring Grace,It was a book that was chosen for a study group and it is not a book that I would have chosen.
4,one of the best,"shonen knife specializes in ramones/beatles-inspired pop-punk, so the most surprising thing about this disc is that many of the songs are at mid-tempo and reveal a depth that we haven't seen before. don't worry, there are still awesome songs about food, but the slower numbers have a beauty that i think shows artistic growth. how does one describe his love for ""the perfect world,"" which covers rumor-mongering, boredom and military action in a three minute melody? this is one of my favorite shonen knife albums."
1,ugly and useless,the helmats are in a weird shape and the pats are so stiff they cant workbut the bells cool
3,Bad Buy,"We bought the helment the size smaller than this for my 2 1/2 year old daughter when we bought her first Big girl bike 16"". Anyways, the smaller size wouldn't even fit her head!! I don't think her head is big by any means. So we went and exchanged it for this. This one is just as bad. The pads are cool but, the helments adhesive came off the first time she wore it and the pads will scratch her if she isn't wearing pants and a long sleeve shirt! DONT BUY!"
4,Great classic fun slashers from the past.,"I had a great time reliving these classic low budget slasher films after picking up this box set. The original film is a classic and a very simple and effective old school slasher, with hot girls, blood and a crazy killer. The second film wasn't as good and tried to hard to rip off ""Freddy"" but the 3rd film brought it back to the style of the the original. They are all fun though and this set is worth having."
4,Son loves the speed,"My 6 year old son took to this trike right away. He loved the speed and control he had on it. He is tall for his age so unfortunately he will probably only fit it for another year or so. I suspect, however, that he will wear the tires out by that time. The seat adjusts for a much smaller child but to be honest I think they would have a hard time powering it. Even my boy has trouble getting it up a slight grade without a running start. Still very fun and very cool looking. Wish they made it in adult size."
4,Too-big wheel. Make that 4-6,"Too big for my 3 1/2 year who is VERY tall for her age. She can't quite reach the pedals, and the smaller one we bought for my two year old is a better fit. Good little big wheel though, and she'll reach the pedals before too long. Well made, easy to install. Everything fit well."
4,My little guy is finally able to enjoy this.,"Update from my first review----I ordered this for my son for Christmas and waited to put it together (so he wouldn't find it) and two key parts were missing. I had to wait a few days after the holiday before being able to get in contact with anyone at Radio Flyer to send me the missing parts, but they were great about it and I just received them and my son was able to ride it today and totally loved it. It's a nice size bike and will definitely allow him to grow with it. He loved the flag and it seems like a very durable bike. Overall, I am happy with this bike--I just wish it could have been under my tree on Christmas morning. But honestly I think I cared much more then my son."
4,Great Item,We got this big wheel for our VERY tall 3 year old son. He loves it. He honestly rides it better then he does his tricycle. He got the hang of it pretty quick and then we couldn't get him off. His older 6 year old brother got the razor rip 360 so both boys were going up and down our street for over an hour. Highly recommended....the only issue I have it that my son complained that his back hurt and upon inspection later he had a slight bruise on his lower back...now we did have the seat in the first setting so hopefully once he gets a little taller and we adjust the seat he will be more comfortable.
4,Doesn't Work on Zoysia Grass Unless on a Hill,"My nephew lives in the city so my mom got this big-wheel for him to play with at her house where she actually has a yard. She has Zoysia Grass which is extremely thick, dense and cushiony. My nephew can't peddle on the grass otherwise the front wheel just spins in place and the big-wheel doesn't move. He has to run up the hill and then get someone to give him a push so he can peddle down the hill. He's going to be 4 this coming week, has very long legs and is big for his age, but he still has to have the adjustable seat on the notches closest to the peddles. He can peddle really well on the patio (which is stone) but it's real small. We have asphalt trails nearby that would probably work out better, we shall see soon. He enjoys it regardless, he's pretty easy to please. It wasn't too difficult to put together, I put everything together myself except the part that needed torquing, since I'm weak."
5,Perhaps the most awesome present in the history of presents?,"I bought this for my son for Christmas and all I can say is ""AWESOME!"". It is well made like all the radio flyer stuff. Far sturdier and more durable than other big wheels out there. And it just looks amazing. I'm fairly certain than when my son is my age he'll remember this gift fondly and will take great pleasure buying a similar product for his kids."
4,Great toy,"Forty-three years ago my son had this type of three-wheeler and he loved it, spent countless hours riding it. When I saw this similar one, I knew I had to buy it for his daughter. What wonderful memories it brings back to see her riding the big wheel her father liked so much. The Radio Flyer makes a great product---I recently received one of their ""toys"" for my 70th birthday----a wagon for my garden work."
3,Son loves it but it bruises his back,We bought this for our four-year-old son at the beginning of Summer '08. He loves riding it. I agree with another reviewer who said hills are tough. The traction on the front tire is very helpful and overall this bike has been great on all levels. The only drawback we've seen is that after riding for about 30 minutes our son develops a bruise on his lower back. We've adjusted the seat thinking he was too close but at that distance he can't push all the way through. He loves it so much we've been trying to find some way to cushion it.
2,Not worth the extra money,"Other than a VERY uncomfortable seat, this product was great for my 2 young sons.....for the first year that we had it. Shortly after the 1 year mark, the back tires just split down the middle and fell apart. I called Radio Flyer, who told me that it was out of warranty and there is nothing they could do...I could pay for another wheel if I wanted to. WHAT? I paid almost twice as much (compared to an original Big Wheel) for a product that I thought was made by a company known for durable products, and I barely get one year out of it? The Big Wheel that we had previously lasted longer than this. I suggest spending less money and buying a Big Wheel. At least when you have to replace it, you won't be paying as much. Thanks, but no thanks, Radio Flyer."
3,For Tall Boys!,"We received this bike for our 2-year-old's birthday, and he is now a tall 3-year-old and still can't reach the pedals. This bike is really for ages 4 and up!"
1,Defective,"We bought this for our son's big Xmas gift--after three hours of trying to get it together, we realized it wasn't going to happen as it was defective! The metal plate wasn't built correctly. This was a big disappointment overall."
2,not so happy,We were disappointed that it didn't have a hand brake as the big wheel does. It was hard to put together. May have to order a couple parts due to installation problems.
5,Great Fun !,I sent this to my 3yr old nephew for Christmas and he went bonkers over it ! He has been driving it since he received it and his older brother now wants one of his own. My sister said the seat was great because as he grows the seat can be adjusted and she said it was very well made.
5,My boys enjoy riding on it,"My two boys (3 and 5) enjoy riding this toy. I bought it for them for last Christmas and it took about 20 minutes to put it together (very easy). Since the seat is adjustable (the gray part where you lean back), I adjust them for my boys. Overall a good solid toy and none to beat Radio Flyer style and quality."
1,Not great,I feel that this lens seems a lot slower then my others. Since this is not a lens that I must use since I have a better lens at the same focal length I rarely use it. I don't recommend it but others might like it.
5,Fantastic,"I tried these after using and enjoying the Lavazza Gran Crema full-caffeine pods. I was pleasantly surprised to find that these decaf pods are not missing anything at all in terms of strength, flavor, or volume of espresso. In fact, these decaf pods taste as good as or better than any full-caffeine pods I have tried, including the Lavazza Gran Crema mentioned above and Lucaffe's own Blucaffe,100% Arabica (black bag) and Exquisit (red bag). These are excellent!"
3,"An Honest Product, But Fragile.","First things first.Apparently, there are a lot of cheap knockoffs of this toy on the market.This particular model is genuine.I appreciate the reviews from other Amazon customers for pointing that out.This little machine performs as advertised, and can be a lot of fun.Having said that, it is a very fragile machine.A well-intentioned child(or adult, for that matter)can damage this little helicopter, very easily.This is not meant to be a knock against it,just something to be aware of.Because of the design of it, it is not able to hover in one place. It will always be flying either forwards, or backwards, but never completely still. The manual points out this fact.Having said that, I have no regrets about buying it."
2,Not that great.,"I bought this light from Walmart for about 15 dollars.First of all the headlight is large and nothing about it says sleek, but I didn't let that bother me. After some manipulation (it wasn't quite as easy as the instructions made it out to be) I got both lights mounted and running.The taillight has so far been great. It's quite visible and has many different flash patterns.Unfortunately, the head light isn't as bright as the tail lights. Plus, five minutes into my third use (my night rides were no longer than 30 minutes tops), it went out. I got home and discovered that the light had caused my new batteries to explode, and now the light is no good whatsoever.It's not a total waste, as the rear light is fantastic, but overall I would say that it is a waste of money. I'll be investing in a better headlight."
5,We found it spot on!,"Having been to Provence about ten times in the last twenty years, I've read plenty of guides, and none have gone as directly to the heart of the matter as this one. There are plenty of posey guides out there, but if you want to know what makes the region tick, warts and all, I recommend Facaros and Pauls. The others seem shallow in comparison. And these guys make me laugh, an added bonus!"
4,Kathy Long is Awsom!,"Kind of a modern day ""High Plains Drifter"" Long never says who she is but you get the impression that she's the murdered girl come back to get revenge. What Long lacks in acting ability she makes up for in martial arts skills. Perfect location for this story to unfold. Long has this sly sexiness about her that just keeps you glued to the screen. I'd watch her over Cynthia Rothrock any day!"
4,Worlds Cutting Edge,I'm an artist working with edged weapons to create welded steel sculptures. I found this book to be a great source of illustrations and background on the history of the sword. Getting a feel for the use of each sword as well as the period in time that it was created has inspired me to develop new forms and combinations of individual elements. This book can be enjoyed as a coffee table experience or on a deeper level as a valuable resource for historical reference.Jim[...]
2,"No, doesn't do it all!","Why would Sony make a 5-disk CD/DVD changer that can't even shuffle tracks on all 5 CDs?I bought this model because I wanted something that was as good as my old 5-CD changer but could also play DVDs. Little did I know that Sony had put a 5-disk tray into a DVD player with the reading ability of a single disk player, and then jacked up the price.In addition, I have to unplug the model to reset it once a week or so. If I don't, it starts chirping like a cricket during playback.If you're looking for a good 5-disk changer, DON'T go with this model!"
5,Beware Roger The Chapman novels are addictive,"This is first of the Roger The Chapman books I happened to read. I do recommend that you start with Death and the Chapman. (Death is not the best book in the series but it is very good.) After reading this book, Holly Innocents, I found myself addicted to Roger and his world. These aren't difficult mysteries to solve on your own; with the exception of Wicked Winter, I figured out what was going on long before Roger did. Their appeal instead is a very appealing character and the amazing and realistic Old English world Sedley creates."
4,Wallplate,"The wallplate was fine, & I greatly appreciate that Amazon.com had this item listed (I was only able to locate the item on 2 other websites and they each wanted prohibitive fees for shipping and handling of a 2-3 oz. piece of plastic). I couldn't even locate this item (in this color) in my local hardware or electric stores. The only problem I had was that the price for the item itself was so high at Amazon.com. Where the other sites had the item for a price of $1-$2, Amazon's price was nearly $5 just for the wallplate. The only reason I went w/ Amazon was that the combined cost of the wallplate and S&H was less than those of the other sites (they wanted $10-$12 just for the S&H). I really think you need to look into why a small piece of plastic is listed for 2-2.5 times the price others have it listed for."
1,"Lies, Lies, Lies, Slanderous lies","This book should sell in the pure fiction area. How can lies be published. I've been a Hampton Firefighter for 12 years. The only racial slurs I've ever heard were made in private, and meant to be private only. I'm one of the people accused of making racial slurs, and I can tell you that they were all done in the privacy of the fire house. When the bell rings, my racist beliefs stay at the fire house. I treat blacks as good as I treat whites."
1,"Fifty % true; fifty % lies, & one hundred % hate.","This is a shamefull work of hypocrisy, Jop did most of what heaccuses others of doing...the other parts of his creation were acombination of truths and dark imagination brought on by the desire to hurt people because he did not get his way. Mr. Jop's portrayed concern for minorities is nothing more than a vehicle to launch his attacks. I worked with Mr. Jop in the Hampton Fire Division and it is not the same place described by Mr. Jop. He tarnishes many fine people with the same tar brush which should have been reserved for the guilty. In reality Mr. Jop is guilty of taring and ""feathering"" himself with a higher degree of guilt than will ever be acknowledged by the people he hopes to hurt. If you want to learn how not to go about addressing social grievances.. then get and read this book."
3,McDougall Made Easy,"The product was attractive but the recipes, in spite of being told they were ""delicious"", were bland and rather tasteless. I was disappointed."
3,"Atlantis, Alien Visitation and Genetic Manipulation","This book is written in the style of a research project. Instead of a fluid story to read, the flow of literature is constantly interrupted with quotations from other sources to back up the information being presented. The quotations are sometimes interesting but can become tedious and distracting from the story. This book is also divided into two sections. Half of the book is the ""story"" and the other half of the book is ""just a list of dates of world events in chronological order."" Overall, the idea of the book's topic is an interesting one but again, half of the book is dedicated to quotations and a chronological date order of facts which means the actual story being told is not that long. Considering this book can sell for over $100.00 at many bookstores, I would recommend buying it from the Michael Tsarion website (if he has any in stock) which is cheaper, buying it used, or borrowing it free from a friend. Happy reading everyone!"
3,"Good approach to AMOS, sometimes hard to follow","The book is comprehensible in general, it permits to make the exercises in Amos very easily. Nevertheless some explanations are hard to follow, for instance, what she call the ""smorgasbord"" of quality indices and other technical issues are difficult to follow, I had to read several times to connect the ideas and get the final picture of what she tries to explain, and figure out why the output may indicate that the model may be bad and good at the same time.Concerning explanations I prefer the book by Tenko Raykov about SEM, but it is not related to AMOS, so the book by Byrne is acceptable. in addition Byrne provides several examples that are very useful."
3,Ok mints,"Plain and simply these mints are ok because of the caffeine value when you need it. The taste is not the best though and I think it is because of the bitter quality of caffeine. The times I have taken these, they did prevent the caffeine withdrawal headache when coffee was not going to be available during the day."
3,Fun yet disappointed,"I got this and really wanted to try this when it came. Put a little gear monster together and come to find out one of the dome glowing pieces batteries did not work, so already we had to replace the batteries and spend even more money and they use watch size batteries. So that was frustrating. It did make my little girl happy but it should of come with some complimentary batteries for this very reason."
2,Less fun that anticipated,"This toy was purchased for a 5 year old boy who loves mechanical stuff and while at first he was interested, he only plays with it when his father can help him, Dad does most of the work putting it together - perhaps when he's older he can do it by himself? One or two of the plastic pieces broke by the 2nd use."
5,"An Academic's ""Confederacy of Dunces""","If you have sullied your shoes in the quagmire of academic politics, you will find this book amusing. (If you haven't, it's still pretty darned funny, although it does require an appreciation for in-jokes of the academic kind.)"
4,True Love,"I feel that this was a good book in general, but I was kind of offended by the way she protrayed the Indian culture. Maybe she had to do it this way in order to get her point across, but there could have been a better way. I mean she used alcoholism and sex as a main theme is the book, before she got to the real heart of the people. I did like the end of the book when everyone realizes that they do need one another. The book was very nice though and I appreciate the learning experience."
4,Journal,"Love Medicine is an eloquently written story which helps us understand life on a reservation and, more importantly, that it is love that keeps the family together. It is very helpful that the novel is written in a way as to let the reader examine and relate to each character on a individual basis. Although the characters are presented individually, all of the stories intertwine allowing the audience to experience the families on a personal level. Although the book moves slowly in certain areas, overall it is an emotionally interesting book."
4,Journal #8,"Love Medicine is a wonderful novel shown to the reader by the individual perspectives of the characters. The trials and tribulations of the characters are unique to them in the materialistic sense, but they experience the emotional turmoil that everyone can relate to. This novel carries us through the never ending cycle of love, hatred, and lust. By opening the door for her reader Erdrich succesfully opens the door to our own souls in which we find the same basic human traist she portrays in each of her characters. I highly reccomend this book for anyone who would enjoy a refreshingly honest author."
3,CSU Pomona ENG 105-23,"The Love Medicine is set on the American Indian lifestyle. It makes you wonder why these characters in the book had to live their life like that. I love almost every story about Native Americans but this novel showed the ""real"" side of their life and how they must cope with their problems. The novel was sometimes confusing, especially with all the characters and the many relationships going on. You must be very openminded to read this book and must appreciate the Navite American culture. This novel was good but not the best that I have read."
3,Out of the dust,When i started reading Out of the Dust I thought it was kind of boring.Once you start to get in the book it gets really good. Karen Hesse the author did really good on showing symbolizem. I liked how they showed the apples meaning life and death. Also how the dad haveing skin cancer thet showed the he was routing away and was getting towards death. I will probley read this book a second time. If i were to rate this book it would be a 6. If you are over 11 years old and you like peotry and some action you should read this book. I think you would like it. Most of my classmates who i read this book with liked it too. I would recomend it to you. So go to the bookstore and but it now.
4,"Great journal, opressive story","Billie Jo is quite a deep thinker at times, and her journal is deeply moving and inspiring. The story is quite depressing, but at least it has a happy ending. It is really her comments about things that made the book for me."
5,A sad but wonderful story of a family's trials and hopes.,"Out of the Dust is a sad story of hope and pride. This wonderful book is a gathering of journal entries from the point of view of a young girl named Billie Jo while growing up during the Dust Bowl in Oklahoma. Her family tries to grow wheat, which is often destroyed by wind, lack of rain, and dust. Dust storms fill the peoples' homes, as well as eyes, ears, noses, and mouths - Billie Jo sets the table with the dishes upside down to keep the dust off them! The family barely gets by with a lot of hard work and determination. Billie Jo's mother dies in childbirth from injuries from an accident, which also hurts Billie Jo's hands. The mother's death was devastating, and because of Billie Jo's hands, she couldn't play the piano, her only comfort. Her father was stubborn and difficult, so there were some very tough years. Many others have moved on to California or elsewhere, but through hope, pride, and love, this family makes it through."
3,Out Of The Dust,Billie Joe is a girl that is named after a boy because her dad wanted a boy. It tells want kind of things that they did.The story tells how Billie joe has to deal with the death of her mother.Shows also shows what she did all day while the dust as was blowing.Tells the story of how the dust started and why it started.The time it went from and the time that it ended.
3,My Review...,"This is a sad book, but good. It expresses experiences that a lot of people had felt. I was really sorry for Billie Joe. After I finished it It made me think of all my family members that have died."
1,This book stinks!!!!!!!!!!,This book was the dumbest book I have ever read. What girl could be so stupid that she would throw kerosene on ones own mother. I suggest you read any other book besides this one.
3,A Brush With Dust,"OUT OF THE DUST by Karen Hesse, was an okay novel. The author incorperates a forteen year old's personal feelings, and also facts about the Geat Depression, and the Dustbowl. If I could change the book in any way, I would talk more about the depression and maybe less about the dust. My favorite part of the novel was when Billy-Jo wins third place at the Joyce City Competition, even when her hands were burned. It showed that she could do anything if she tried. I would reccomend this book for someone who is interested in history."
4,Different and Unique,I thought this book was very interesting becauase of the way that it was written. I never thought that a book written by free verse could create such a great story line that was so very moving and well written. It also explains the story well. Ms. Hesse has obviously worked very hard and the book deserves its Newbery Medal. I liked best how Ms. Hesse used free verse poetry to express the hardships of a young teenage girl during the Depression and Dust Bowl. I read this book on my own time and there's no doubt about it that it was worth it!
2,A Mon avis...,"Though this book is well written and has a creative style I absolutely despised the story. The reason I dislike this book has nothing to do with it being ""very sad"" as some other reviewers have commented. Instead I dislike the book because the story is lacking and I do not think the author does a good job of creating empathy towards the characters. Usually when a reading a ""sad"" book I have sympathy towards the characters. In this book there was none. Also I felt the character development was lacking. I don't reccomend this book if you are looking for a good story I do reccomend it though if you are interested in learning about free verse or seeing how the author shaped the story."
2,What can I say?,"I didn't really like this book. I had to read it with school, and that may be why, but I didn't really like it. I found it pretty boring!!"
3,Dust Bore,"I gave Out of the Dust 3 stars because I thought it could have been better. The tale of Billie Jo, growing up in the Dust Bowl and her life was really heart breaking; but the fact that it was written in blank verse poems made it boring. The plot was excellent and I thought it would have been much more moving if it had more descriptions that couldn't be reached by putting it in poem form. Many of the poems were really well written, but it was only a few out of 100. Also, the book was recommended for children ages 9-12.It should have been recommended for ages 7-10 for the vocabulary was elementary, and the plot was vary easy to follow. I did, however, like the way the book moved quickly. So I would recommend this book if you like poetry and a new style of telling a life story."
3,out of the dust,This was a book that i read in L.A. class and found it intristing. Its about a young girl named billie jo who overcomes the dust and over comes family problems that plague her everywhere she goes. I would give this a three because gives great historical facts and teaches the student about the tough times that the farmers went through during the dust bowl.
3,Review for Out of the Dust for Ms. Bergs class,"I thought Out of the Dust was an okay book. If I had to rate it on a one to ten scale (ten being the best) I would give it a seven. I didn't like it too much because it was a tragic book and it had quite a bit of drama. I'm not too fond of books that have too much tragedy and drama. Other than those two categories, I thought it was great.It was some what of an educational book. It taught me more about the dust bowl and how it effected so much of the population's crops. Anywhere the people went, like California or to the west, things didn't get any better.I couldn't imagine what it felt like to back then to live in such misery and have everything destroyed by the dust. It was like everyone and everything was eaten by the dust. Once people started planting the crops the dust destroyed them again. If it rained the water would wash away the wheat and the soil.This was an intresting book. I thought it was okay. If there was a sequal I might read it."
2,Out of the Dust Critique,"I didn't like anything about this book. The book wasn't exciting at all. Almost the whole book was dull. I think it would have been more exciting to me if the dust storms would've been in Phoenix and not in Oklahoma during 1953. Although I didn't think it was very good, Out of the Dust taught me how hard it was to live in the time of the Dust Bowl. I gave this book two stars, because it was dull and boring. The only part I liked in this book was when Ma caught on fire as a result of the kerosene. I liked this moment even though it was sad, it was also exciting."
4,Out of the Dust by: sufer92,"This amazing story, Out of the Dust, is about a heartsick, fourteen year-old girl (Billy Jo) who lives in a life of suffering. When the Great Depression rolls around, so does her town's fate. As result from WWI, a series of dust storms attack during the drought of the century. During this awful time Billy Jo was involved in a near fatal accident in which her mother got severely burned and left her hands unable to play the only source of happiness, the piano. After several days of regret her mother dies, which leaves Billy Jo and her father to find some way to communicate and forgive each other for the death of her mother. In this book, the brilliant author leaves you with a new understanding of life on the panhandle during the dustbowl of the 1930's."
2,Out of the Dust,"The book ""Out of the Dust"" is decent but leaves out important descriptions of the main characters friends or enemies that form the shape of person that the main character will become. Most of what you know about Billie Jo is that she is long-legged, has freckles, and will eventually burn her hands badly. The book describes nothing but the family and even within the family the sense of character of the others is very vague and hard to understand why they did that. This book tells almost nothing Billie Jo does all day except for school and playing piano. The important part of this book is that as you read it you begin to understand what life would be like full of dust and with very little water. Overall this book is mostly a vague idea of what personal life would be like in the Dust Bowl."
2,Out of the Dust,"For the most part I got really bored easily. I mean come on you pretty much can predict what's going to happen next, more dust. Although I was grasped a little by the story line. You really have no idea that the girl was thatr miserable. I would recomened this book to a person who likes slightly boring books."
3,Lauren's Review,"Out of the Dust is about a girl named Billie Joe and her family trying to survive the Dust Bowl. Billie Joe's mom is cooking one day and she decides to pour water on the stove. Instead of water, it is kerosene. Fire is all over her and the baby. They died from the fire and Billie Joe had scars all over her hands and arms. Billie Joe also loves to play the piano. She gets offered a lot of places to play. Billie Joe is my favorite character. She is brave and has a lot of positive aditude about everything. Her dad is not really the brightest person in the world, and I think he should have talked to Billie Joe about what happened. I don't like reading little poems. I rate this book a 4 on a scale of one to ten."
4,Out Of the Dust,"Out Of the DustWant to read a book that has loneliness, courage, and accidents? If so, read Out Of the Dust. Karen Hesse is an awesome writer. The main character in this book is a girl named Billy Jo. She loves to play the piano. Billy Jo is trying to find peace in Oklahoma. After the big accident her life in horrible. It is scarring her inside and out. Her father doesn't like to talk about it. The only thing that can make her happy is by playing the piano but she can't with her burned hands.Her father's farm is being terrorized by dust storms. He doesn't stop giving up on his wheat. If you want to know what the big accident or more about the book, read it! It's great."
4,Out of the dust,This is a great historical document. This book captures the dramtic tension of this event. For example the part when Billie Jo (the main character) burns her hands and describe how difficult it is to survive during the dust storm. This book should be rated a 4 out of 5 because of how fun of a book it was to read. The author Karen Hesse wrote the book as if it were a diary. She also wrote it in a poem form. I hope you take the time to read this book. By: Mark Johnson
5,A novel full of symbolism.,"The novel Out of the Dust written by Karen Hesse, is full of symbolism. Karen did a very good job in writing this novel. It shows just how hard the Dust Bowl was and how tragic it could be to a family. Though it shows a lot of hardship, it does also show some greatness. The dust separated Billie Joe's family, but brought it together in a sense. When Billie Joe ran away from home she realized how much she really missed her father. The dust separated her father and her on the outside, but on inside it just made them stronger. This novel was a very educating and interesting book, although it was written in poetry form (which I don't like poetry). I would recommend this novel to anyone and everyone."
5,Covered by dust,"I liked this book because it really tied in symbolism. This book is appropriate for the ages of ten to 15 years old. This book is appropriate for these ages because this book is very well written for a younger child to understand. It, however is a well- written book for children between the ages of ten and 15 years old. My favorite poem in this book is ""On Stage"" because it was shape to look like a piano. Billie Jo enjoyed to played the piano, but in this story it was ""covered by dust"" and so was Billie Jo. I really enjoyed this book. I hope that you will enjoy this book as well. Enjoy reading this wonderful book by Karen Hesse."
4,All about Billie-Jo,"I would give this book four stars because although I like to listen about Billie-Jo's life style and find out about the problems she had to solve, it was hard to read. It was hard because it was written like a poem. there were many commas and not a lot of periods to stop at and take a breath.Billie-Jo lived with her mother and father. Billie-Jo's mother was pregnant with a baby boy. One day their house caught on fire. Billie -Jo's mother got burned very badly. Billie -Jo`s hands were burned too. Billie-Jo's mother died giving birth to her brother and her life change. Billie-Jo couldn't play her piano for a while because of her burned hands. Billie-jo's father wasn't the easiest guy to live with because of his grief. Billie-Jo needs to go on with her life but can she? Billie-Jo has a chance to live with her aunt but she decides to live with her with her dad.I think someone that likes to read about peoples lives and problems will in enjoy this joy this book."
5,a very good novel,"The ""Out Of The Dust"" is a ""John Newbery Medal"" winner.It starts with a mother wanting a baby boy,but ands up with a baby girl named Bille Jo.Then it gets worse.as it goes on something tragic happens.Then Bille jo is left with one person to help her,but she learns that she can still be happy some times.I liked this book very much.It is a sad,happy,and alot more emotions in this book. I would recommend this book for kids and grandparents.Hope you like it to."
2,The dust bowl repersented by BLAZE in C - Land,I dont realy like the book so.This was boring unless u like the way theBIG dusty storm looked.but if u like this stuff like that.then u would like 2 read this book.I think for people who like this book an like to know about there history...............but no one from C- Land better like it.!!!!!!!!~!!!
2,OuT OF THe DuSt,"This book is about A girl named Joe. Joe is a girl who lives out in the middle of nowhere. She has a mother that is pregnent, and her dad is always very mad. Joe is a very good piano player,untill one day a fire in the kitchen broke lose.Joe's hands were burnt when she was trying to tame the fire, and her mother was burnt very bad, then they took her to the hospital. When she was at the hospital she started to have her baby.After she had her baby she died because of the wounds from the fire.The baby also died because of the fire, before the mother died she called the baby Franklin. After the president at that time."
1,My review about Out Of The Dust,Hi! ... I read the book Out Of The Dust. This review is about how I rate the book from 1 to 5. I rate this book one because it is a really boring book and it is all poems. The poems are all quite boring. The main person in the book is called Billie Jo. She lives in the dust bowl during the Great Depression and wants to get out of the dust bowl. Her mom dies and she lives with her dad. They both miss her very much. Billie Jo finally figures out that she wants to still to live in the dust bowl. What im trying to say is the book is REALLY BORING.
1,the not so good review,i didn't like the book because the book was just a long poem. And i don't like poems and it was just a never ending poem. And i don't really like the name allthough theire was a funny part and it wasn't fast and it wasn't active.
4,Out of the Dust Book Review,"My favorite poem, in Out of the Dust, is ""Met"" because in this poem the daughter, Billie Jo, returns home after running away. This is when they learn how to be happy and start to become a family againsince the death of her mother.I think this book is appropriate for people in 4th grade and higher because I tried reading it in 3rd grade and couldn't understand many of the concepts and the vocabulary.I liked how in the poem, ""The Dream"", the placement of words on the page is set in a unique way. This is done because unlike the other poems it is happy and set in a dream.Overall, I like this book because it was interesting to learn about what it might have been like to live during the Great Depression."
4,Out of the Dust,"I liked the book for most part. Some parts got boring, but other parts I was crying or just plain really interested in the book!!! I think Karen Hesse did a really good job at trying to make it feel like you were there when you closed your eyes!!! It seemed really real to me!!! i think that there were some things she could have added to make some of the parts more interesting, but that was her choice to make the book that way!!! you do need some down time on all of the suspense, and drama!!!"
2,Just Like Dust,"This book is very bland. It is exactly what i expected to be, very dull and boring. Being that there is no climax, i don't find any point to the book. The only amazing thing about it is that, she can write a book in all poems and make it blend together like a real story. Although the story goes by fast, it seems like the days it takes place in are slow. I wouldn't recommend this book, if your looking for a fun thrilling story."
5,Read This Fascination!,"Have you ever read a book that was depressing? I liked OUT OF THE DUST because the author makes her writings visual, and i like to read books with entries instead of chapters. I would recommend this book to anybody who likes to read books that are like diaries. Books that basically have entries instead of chapters."
4,Out of the Dust,I liked it pretty well because Billie Jo had alot of sad things happen to her and her family and she handeled them very responsibly and mature about everything. I would prefer kids to read this book.I think they would like it. I would give this book to kids ages 9-12
5,Adult review -- wow!,"My daughter's fourth grade class had to read a Newbery Award winningbook. When my daughter chose ""Out of the Dust,"" I decided to read italso, so I could see if the content was too adult. I am so glad Idid, not because there was anything offensive in the book that I neededto shield my daughter from, but because it gave me the opportunity toread a wonderful, beautifully written book. The writing is so vivid that you feel the grit in Billie Jo's teeth, the pain in her hands, thesorrow in her heart. With just a few words, Karen Hesse evokes deep emotion and stark images. My daughter loved it too. She couldn't have chosen a better book for her transition from chapter books to longer novels. I highly recommend it for both children and adults."
5,weight of the dust,"I'm writing to tell you about the book Out of the Dust. This is a wonderful book that is written a poem like way. Each poem has a great amount of meaning. In this book the little girl's name is Billy-Joe. She is 13 years old and she has a very hard life and it takes all the strength she's got too get over her burns, and the sad feeling she has because she felt like she killed her mother and the baby. In this book Billy-Joe feels like she is losing her father, so she struggles to gain his love back. This is a wonderful book and it's highly recommended by me."
3,"Okay, but not a must read.","This book was very easy to read, but I found it difficult to get past the free verse style of writing. The story was very choppy with very little growth of the characters. The end is satisfying, though, and feels good."
5,Barbara's Review,"The book is good. It's sad aat times but other wise it's good. It is writin in verse which I think is fun to read.Billie Jo's mom is pregnant and is expecting a boy. Or atleast she hopes she is. Billie Jo's mom gets burned bad and Billie's hands are not in any condition to play the piano. The towns people are blaming Billie Jo for her mothers condition when it's not intierly her fault. The baby is on its way. Her mother dies givind birth. By the time the Aunt gets there to take the baby away to raise it as her own the baby is dead too. What will happen to Billie Jo and her father?The type of person who would like this book is a girl, Who has read any of the American Diary books. I don't think a boy would be very interested in it. The book is about a young girl and I don't think a boys are ver interested in that kind of book."
1,The big dust,(By:T.B.) I did not like the book at all. I hated how Billie Jo was scarred for life. Her mom died with the baby it name was franklin because her father was looking forward for his wife to have a boy but she had girl. Her father burned Billie Jo and her mother. Nonething grow in the field not the wheat or the apple. The boy Billie Jo likes is gone his name is mad dog. Her best friend gone somewere. This book I would recomme if you like book like that.
4,Out of Dust,"I think the book is a good historical document. The reason it is so good, the book shows what it is like to live during the dust bowl. The author Karen Hesse uses very descriptive words to catch the dramatic tension of this event. The part that relats to that is when Billie Jo burns her hands and shows how hard it was to survive during the dust storm with that kind of injury. I also enjoyed the way she wrote the story. She worte the book in diary form. She worte in small poems. It is a quick and easy book to read."
2,Awesome book,The Newbery Award Book Out of the Dust is an exicting and sad story. I liked how the author put this book in diary form. The girl in this story is scared about a terrible accident that happens in her life. She has alot of feelings she can't express. She is scared of herself. She thinks her dad doesn't care about anything anymore. This book talks about dust storms in the 1920's in Oklahoma. If you are looking for a real life story try reading this book.
4,great for the fans,"I thought this thick book would be at worst repeating things already mentioned in the saga, as the style of Eddings is similar to fairytales rather than an attempt for a realistic feeling world, and the stereotypes (particularly describing the various peoples and cultures) he already created in books 1 to 5 were repeated enough as it is. I was right about that, he repeats some things but generally speaking 90 percent of this book is all new material, as the history from Belgarath's point of view.I had a great deal of good laughs; the book has a slower pace and allows for greater detail at points, but Eddings spares us a lot of boredom and still manages to capture not only great events but also everyday life. Robert Jordan could learn a thing or two from Eddings even though he might have greater talent."
3,Read better,"The book said nothing new and the characters tend to irritate after a while, but what I really want to comment on is some of the other reviews from British readers. If your going to share your views all well and good but please spell things correctly or you make us all look stupid in front of the Americans. Im currently in America and learning firsthand how incredibly dim this race is."
4,Fun,Don't look for anything deep but if your looking for something that is fun for those rainy days read it. If you want something deep read Robert Jordan or Marion Zimmer Bradley.
2,Don't bother!,"I have read every single book of Eddings' fantasy serieses(except Polgara's story) and I have liked some of them but this book is merely a long overview. There is nothing very amazing and new in this book and it isn't deep story. It was quite boring to read it and it took long time to finish, which is quite unusual for me."
3,"Slow goings, but I read it anyway","Well, it feels just like the Belgariad. I initially liked the Belgariad a lot, but the problem is that it is the same thing over and over. The characters are pretty much one-dimensional. The humor is the same over and over, not so humorous anymore. Also, the enemies never pose a real threat to the heroes, there's no tension or drama because the ""good guys"" are all smug and the bad guys are incompetent.But if you slogged through the series which does have a pleasant homey feel to it then you're obliged to read this which neatly ties up all of the history of Eddings' world."
5,Gripping!!!,This book is by far Eddings' greatest endeavour. The complete story of Belgarath the sorcerer fills in the gaps left in The Belgariad and The Mallorean and shows the reader where Belgarath's attitude and fairly strong opinions come from. I couldn't put it down.
3,The same song 7 times,"Didn't know it was a single 7 times, but that's my fault. The original mix and the deep dish is the best in the CD. I could've gotten then song from one of the whole albums."
3,Meh,"I got this shirt to be part of my Halloween costume (Beth Chapman), in a 4X. I'm 5'4"" and 250; I followed the size chart and measured, and it fit great, even though it was very short. This shirt is sheer lace; it's not really a shirt at all. IDK what I expected, but it was something with lining. I didn't want to have to wear a camisole under it, but there was obviously no other way. I wore the shirt to one party, washed it according to the garment tag instructions, and wore it again. When I took it off that second time one of the buttons popped off. The quality is obviously lacking, but I can't deny that it's pretty. I probably won't wear it again though, which is a bummer."
2,Junior Sizing-Not Women's-about 4 sizes off-fabric flimsy,"This product is in Junior sizing 3x which is about a 16 in women's sizes. A 3x in women's sizes is a 22-24, a long way from a 16! Fabric flimsy."
5,"great mystery, interesting characters",Denise Hamilton writes with understanding of the different cultures that make up Los Angeles. I discovered her first book Jasmine Trade by accident - and couldn't put it down. The second book in the series is just as absorbing with great characters and a fast pace plot that leaves you wondering what twists and turns it will take next.
3,Restor-a-flex,"It is a good product, but more expensive than other products that do essentially the same thing for the animal."
3,A Step Backwards for the Lonestar Boys,"I should of known that the music would be different when I saw the cover of the CD and the change in attire. The bottom line is that Lonely Grill was a much superior product than I'm Already There and sounded more like country music. The current effort is energetic with one-of-a-kind vocals by Richie McDonald, but in my mind is a disappointment."
2,Copies Amazed power-ballad success way too much,"Lonestar didn't really surprise me with their 2001 effort. I'm Already There and Not A Day Goes By suffers from ""Amazed"" syndrome. Amazed's 1999 multi-format mega success is spread all over this album, their wanting to sound like every '80s heavy metal band power ballad. Did they listen to Monster Ballads 2 too much while making this album in Nashville? I'm Already There comes off as very Diane Warren-ish in its sappy lyrics. Their wanting to be diverse as a country band is okay, but these songs don't work for them. These songs are just complete fluff and their other songs are far better than this."
1,POSERS,"I am listening to ""Lone Star"" As I am typing this.The band I am hearing has nothing to do with what I am seeing on this web site. What gives?? Are these guys ripping off a band that pioneered hard rock when no body else had the balls to do it??"
5,Its an album which i can relate to when i listen to a song,"Every song on this album I can relate to.its the kind of album where when you listen to each other a memory in your past or present comes to you and thats a amazing for a band to do that with a whole album.I'm 16 and most people cant believe i like lonestar but their one of my favourite groups and their best ones are ""i'm already there"" and ""Not a day goes by"""
1,Bad Illustrations!,"On getting this book as a ""bonus"" amazon add on... the book is next to useless. It is completely reprinted in a another language; threw half the book and the other contains images that are about 1x2in. DON'T WAIST YOUR MONEY!!! Not on this one! Your better off doing a google image surch"
2,What the....?,Good god! All the songs sound exactly the same! Is this dude related to the guys in AC/DC or something? GONG!!!! NEXT!!
2,All that was bad about Daughter of the Forest,"A second star only because it is about vikings. This is a moronically simple tale full of ludicrous characters and plot-lines, told in a clumsy, heavy-handed style. The main character is dumb, beautiful, and ever-conscious of the rights of women, and he also happens to be a berserker. As was the case with Daughter of the Forest, the author seems to think it's important to let us know how well-endowed her male characters are, i.e., ""I see why they call you 'the little ox' ! ""."
4,Hmmm?,"Marillier is a very talented writer, and anything she has written would be a good experence. Although, I didn't care for the characters in this particular novel. The viking hero was just too dumb. It made the story a bit unbelievable. The beginning and ending are slow. Marillier takes a lot of time setting up the character and wrapping things up. I simply scanned at these points. The rest of the book was interesting and I wouldn't mind reading a second if Marillier decided to make this into a series.I know I didn't make this novel out to be worth anyones time, but I like to repeat, Marillier is a good writer. My suggestion is to read her trilogy (Child of the Prophesy, etc.)"
3,You get what you pay for,Got the kingston memory and it works fine.. just as good as the more higher priced memory... goood buy....
1,Disappointed,"I looked at dozens of slippers online for a long long time and decided on Aussie's. They were the most expensive but according to Aussie they were the best. I followed Aussie's sizing chart before ordering. I'm a solid 10 1/2, sizing chart read order next size up if your 1/2 size for proper fit. I ordered size 11. Received slippers fairly quickly, four stars for that. Tried size 11 slippers on and it was like wearing clown shoes, way over sized and had to spend over $8.00 to return them. I'm out over $8.00 plus for return shipping and no slippers. Take from this review what you will."
3,Where's the Theory?,"I'll admit, this text teaches you how to solve problems, but it lacks the theoretical punch to be a good math text; thus, many of the exercises are straight forward and mechanical. (I'd argue that it's better for engineers who just need to know how to solve problems.) The theory section of exercises tries to remedy the fault, but there simply are not enough exercises to do this adequately. But if you want to learn the prescribed method of solving a typical problem, this is the text you want."
4,Great Customer Service,The purchasing experience exeeded my expectations. The Sellers followed up to ensure that we were happy with the conditon of the purchase. Overall good experience.
1,Will not last very long,"When I first recieved these sheets, I loved them. They are quite soft. They've been washed twice now, and the seams are starting to come apart on the fitted sheet and pillowcases. The edges on the flat sheet are now very frayed and it is coming apart where the sheet if folded over and sewn at the top."
3,Nice deal but a little too sleek for me,"Purchased 6 sets of the flat and fitted sheets over the buy1 get1 deal a few days ago. Got the heather sheets in the mail in 3 days and tried it on the mattress immediately. The color was fine, didn't look faded or dingy. But the fabric itself doesn't feel like very high quality. It was thin and very sleek probably because of the 40% polyester. I have 220 thread count cotton sheets that feel much softer and more comfortable than this. But for the price of less than $3 per piece, it was still a great bargain!"
3,BR1 was great. BR2 was a kidz war movie. Extra disc...,BR1 was not as good as the novel but they did squeeze in as much as they could into the movie. BR2 was obviously created to capitalize on BR1's success but I couldn't really enjoy a war movie fought by 9th graders. The actor playing their teacher was gross over acting. The 3rd disc only had Korean subtitles and I didn't understand Japanese. Buy BR1 and bypass the other two discs unless you're really die-hard fans.
1,Mr. Dionne Is Guilty of Wishful Thinking & so Is His Book.,"Over and over again Dionne inappropriately attempts clumsily to parallel modern politics, circumstances and consequences with ancient history. The bridge he imagines is just simply not there. This book tends to over-think simple, basic concepts. Dionne offers up a weak case."
5,"Key exhortation also found in ""Conversations With God.""","Moving to God consciousness is a common theme of ""TheImpersonal Life"" and ""Conversations With God."" I am notthere yet personally, but both of these books provide the encouragement and guidance we need to head in that direction. For most people, the first reaction to these words spoken to us is puzzlement or outright rejection. But those of you who reread and persist in your attempts to understand will discover first gratitude and then joy. A frequent exhortation found in TIL, ""be still and know that I am God,"" can also be found in CWG, book II, page 153, God's third paragraph."
5,One of the best spiritual books ever written.,"All those who would like to know how all that is IS created by God, how and why MAN is created, how to understand and realize the Living Presence of God in us and as Us - all those have to read this extraordinary book.Years ago I have translated and published it into Croatian language and many, many people had deep benefits from it, and still do. It is really the book that will trasform you. It is REAL, authentic Word of God, so pure and so deep it is. I had simillar personal experiences of some Absolute, Perfect Atributes of God's Consciousness, and I can fully confirm the truths of this wondrous book.You will find related themes in the book of Rubby Nelson, ""The Door of Everything"", also published by Devors.Let God's Love and Light always be the Supreme Ruller in you.Darko Göttlicher"
3,Early Zorro,"Adapted from the serial or not this was an action serial and belongs to those days, Don't compare and you will enjoy. I didn't like Zorro singing, Yakima Canutt did all the stunt work and they cheated the kids on some the cliffhanger endings, but it was an enjoyable one with a good story line."
3,Sallie J,Not as complete as I have seen and owned before. There are better crossword dictionaries out there than this one. This will do in a pinch.
3,Comprehensive A-Z Crosswood Dictionary,I was a little disappointed with this dictionary because the older smaller one had more answers. I prefer the smaller one.
3,"For the genre, it's not bad","this book wasn't horrible - the first part was actually pretty entertaining, but it got a bit tedious after a while. She lies, he discovers, she lies, he discovers...if you really want a great romantic adventure with a fabulous Scotsman and a great, strong English woman, read Diana Gabaldon's OUTLANDER"
2,"Would be good item, but mine was damaged","I received the tubing today and it appears as though a small piece of gravel had scratched through part of the tubing and was still inside the tubing. I don't think it will have much flow through the line!! I had to return the item, and I do not have the option from Amazon to have a replacement sent, so the return is all I get. Now, I have to try and find this in the pet store, which I know will be more expensive."
5,Excellent DVD,I was amazed at how quickly this dvd arrived! Excellent condition and am enjoying watching it over again and again. Thank you.
4,"Not as good as ""Nice"", but still fabulous!","Is it just me? Or is this band really good? Two really good cds(I only have two.I'm not rich you know!) and also on track number ten, is there hints of Beatles songs in there? It sounds like some chords were changed, and one line has a familiar sound to the Beatles song ""Day Tripper"". And more too. Sunrise is a great song, and is going in my comic book 9My friend and I want it to go into the tellie!) Its a great pop song. Hi Hi is catchy, the theme song to Hi Hi puffy amiyumi. Friends forever is a good track, though it was used on Scooby doo 2 (that bothers me). My favorite tracks have to be Hi Hi, Friends forever, Planet Tokyo, Joining a fan club, V-A-C-A-T-I-O-N, True Asia, Boogie Woogie No.5, Sunrise, December, and Teen titans theme (I can't get enough of that theme) Well, end of my review. Happy Shopping!"
4,Excellent collection from a classical (but not military perspective),"This is an excellent collection from the perspective of classical music (as opposed to military) but coming from Karajon and Deutchgrammophone is this really a surprise. My only criticism of this is that because it is from a classical perspective, it lacks the sharp and sudden starts and stops (i.e., bite) that are missing from the interpretation. This is much more of a ""flowing"" interpretation instead. If a military band would have performed instead, it would have been closer to what martial mraches should sound like."
5,House I Live in by Tony Danza review by Peggie,"I watched Who's The Boss sitcom and loved it. I never knew how very talented Tony Danza was and is. This CD was sweet and I really loved the combo of him with his daughter Emmie. Cute so very cute. I hope he does another CD he can really sing and dance and wow, play musical instruments.Peggie"
4,I'm not FAT! and I loved Tony's CD,"Think what you will, but this is a true Italian crooner, of which this world lacks. What a great voice. I can do with out the last 3 songs, but I think I got a good deal, seven songs worth listening to. It's classic and there's nothing wrong with that. If you want Sinatra, then that's what you need to listen to. Tony isn't Frank. He's his own man and a very talanted one at that. His orchestra is awesome. I wasn't disappointed."
5,That's All,I saw Mr. Danza the other night on late night TV and heard him sing for the first time. I ran to my computer and orderd the CD. He is fantastic. I know he would make Mr. Sinatra proud. I love it!!! I hope there is a lot more to come.
4,"Great product, great price","I purchased about 20 pair and have used them for over a year. They are comfortable, medium thickness, and wear out normally."
4,"longer legs, good support","While it's unfortunate the only color available for these was white, because frankly, it's not a charming look. However, somethings do require function over fashion. These being such the case.Buy your normal size in these. Don't go by the indications they give. Many of the reviewers commented that the sizing was off. Part of that problem is since these are 100% cotton, they look positively ginormous when you take them out of the package. After washing a medium is a normal medium.The two benefits that make it worth the 'little boy whities' look are the longer than normal leg which is great for tall guys like my man. And the extra support which is great for those with juevos grandes, like my man."
2,Feedback on Boxer Briefs,Briefs don't fit as good on me as they look on display. The bottom edges don't stay firmly in place as it looks on the display. They tend to wrinkle and bundle up in the crotch area not long after wearing them. The size and look when I put them on the first time are pretty good. They just don't stay that way after brief use.
1,Jai Uttal should return to his roots: Review of Nectar,"I was waiting for Nectar with much anticipation. It was a huge let down. Jai Uttal has abandoned his incredible talent in mixing Indian rhythms and melodies and has gone super religious ! If I want to listen to a pure kirtan CD, Id pick up some original kirtanists from India. There are scores of them. What made Jai's earlier work with the Pagan Love Orchestra so great was the mixing of Western instruments with Indian chants..Jai, when will you go back to your roots again ? Please dont disappoint your fans..Nectar does not have a single decent song except perhaps for the last track.Its time for Jai Uttal to get the Pagans and go back to the Recording Room ! His comparative advantage is in mixing his Western musical roots with Indian music, not in becoming another Indian kirtanist..There are 2 million of them in India and they have an authentic Indian accent ! Although I must say Jai is getting better and better at his Sanskrit.."
5,clean comedy,Sinbad is refreshing and funny. His comedy about becoming old and how things change really hit home with me and my husband.Sinbad is an exceptional example that comedians don't have to be dirty and use curse words to be funny.
5,Good job Sinbad!,"This is one funny DVD... I originally saw this on Comedy Central. After viewing this DVD, there's an additional 20 minutes of various footage that was edited out for CC. I liked it so much, I purchased two copies!!! If you like to laugh, this is a must-have!!!"
5,I Love It!!,I have always LOVED Sinbad:) I was watching Comic View one night and saw this. I was in tears. It is so funny! It brought back memories. I would recommend this to everyone!
4,Almost an awesome toy - don't buy this!,"My son loves anything Tonka, and was crazy over this playset. It is a neat idea and the truck and garage are very cool. They talk to each other and are durable. However the pieces that snap together into the ""boulder loader"" area fall apart ALL THE TIME. It will not stay together, no matter how gentle you are. He just plays with the truck and garage, but all the rest are trash. Too expensive to be this cheaply made!"
3,Looks WAY better than reality,"My son received this as a gift, and it appeared as though it was going to be REALLY neat. If they would have put sensors at the different stations, it could be a really fun toy, but as it is, it is pretty lame, the ""track"" doesn't stay together worth a darn, and all the truck does is drive around and then go back into the garage. It really is on the cusp of being really cool, but it is like they had to stay under $xx on the toy, so they came up with a cool truck/garage, and matched it with garbage for the rest."
5,FANTASTIC,"Too hot for Hollywood!Cutting edge film and sound, outrageous performances, rock, jazz, latin, experimental, classical, underground, interviews with musicians, artists, gays, lesbians, transvestites, scientists on art, sex, drugs, rock and God in San Francisco, gay parade, dikes on bikes, Juneteenth, Folsom street parade, bondage, heroin etc.A collectors item!"
4,Listen to the music that's been in your head for years!,"Don't wait until Christmas to enjoy ""Sleigh Ride."" Hear it now. Don't just remember the theme from ""The Late Show."" Hear ""The Syncopated Clock"" now. Leroy Anderson's music has been in your head for years. Now, instead of imagining it, you can listen to this collection of his best creations. Even if you've never heard these masterpieces, you will delight in ""A Trumpeter's Lullaby,"" ""Bugler's Holiday."" and ""Clarinet Candy."" I must admit that I was not as thrilled with his later work as I was with his early 1950's, so I rated the album only four stars."
5,The Voice of an Angel,"Very melodic; very delicate; hauntingly beautiful...Especially the opening song, 'Highlands.' How incredible that anyone can scale the notes to the degree that Darby does. What is even more inspiring is the fact that, excluding 'Valparaiso,' which was written by Sting, these are songs that either were written by the artist herself or to which she assisted. Songs that are meant to depict our journey through life, from beginning to end to beginning once again...This CD is the heart of Celtic music!"
3,Suger Substitutes,"I tend to like sugar twin as a regular sugar substitute, better than Splenda. I try to stay away from too much regular sugar, but not diabetic or necessary - just as a weight control. I'm trying different kinds of substitutes in foods I consume."
5,Sugar Twin,Can't find this locally. Was THRILLED to find it on the website. Price and shipping are totally reasonable and so worth it!!! Thank you!!!
1,perhaps appropriate for Middle School,"Anyone looking for anything beyond the most basic and overly simplified introduction to great scientists should look elsewhere. Not only is this book written on a very basic level, but it provides no visual aids to assist the reader in understanding complex ideas that very often have powerfully visual/tactile components; for example, the chapter on the periodic table makes frequent reference to earlier models but provides no reproduction of them to illustrate the comparative discussion. Throughout this book, it seems written in a rush and published on the cheap."
1,Brilliant? Yeah right....,"Nightwish has sucked and will always suck! Please, don't waste your time on this album (if you can call it that) when there are REAL masterpieces out there.Don't buy ""Once"" or any of Nightwish's albums, buy these following albums:""...And Justice for All"" by Metallica""Lost and Found"" by Mudvayne""Lateralus"" by Tool""Believe"" by Disturbed""XIII"" by Mushroomheadand ""Toxicity"" by System of a Down.Thank you!"
5,Different Sound to what I'm used to but....,This has got to be one of the best CD's I've heard in a long time... just the metal sound and female vocals mixed with orchestra... gives me a tingling sensation! A special and strange sound that I enjoy!!!
5,Nice Change,"Out of all the Nightwish CDS I own, this one sounded... quite different from the others. It is really good, and I have enjoyed it thoroughly. For those ppl that say this is trash - they really have no room to talk. I doubt they could sing like Tarja can, plus she's been professionaly trained. For each and every one of you who diss them - you really have no taste in music."
4,Great Music,This is a great Nightwish cd. I like all the songs on it. You can't go wrong buying this if you like there other stuff. I can't stop listening to it. Tarja's voice absolutely mesmerizes me.
2,"How do you say ""overrated"" in Finnish?","Being a fan of hard rock bands with female singers (Within Temptation, Lacuna Coil, The Gathering, and yes, even the dreaded Evanescence), more people than I can count have told me to check out Nightwish, with ""Once"" being the album most recommended. So I did ... and came away from the experience unimpressed. Tarja Turunen does have an absolutely beautiful voice and the band rocks extremely hard, but the juxtaposition of the two sounds like Renee Fleming geting lost on the way to the Met and ending up in the studio with Iron Maiden. It just doesn't mesh. Tarja is now out of the band so perhaps the band will get (or has gotten) a singer that's not so technically perfect. I can see where the music would have appeal, but it's just not for me. Your mileage, of course, may vary."
3,Nothing new or special here,"Evanescence meets Qntal. Nice production values, but the lyrics are trite and the music redundant.You want to listen to a great Finnish Goth Metal band? Listen to Gothminister."
1,Please,I don't know what the reviewers are carrying on about here. It's Evanescence-type dreck with an orchestra. Silly people creating really silly music.
5,WOW!,"Well, I just read a reveiw which pretty much says everything I want to say... but I'll say it again anyway. This is by far Nightwish's best album. If I could I'd give it 10 stars! They have come so far since there first album and they just keep getting better with every album. This kind of music is not for everyone, it is an aquired taste and you have to keep an open mind. Tarja's voice is so beautiful, I try to mimik her, but nobody will ever come close! Nightwish has been my favorite band for about 2 years and I own all there albums. Definatly check out their other albums if you like them. Oceanborn and Wishmaster are most commonly said to be the best albums. My favorite song on Once is Ghost Love Score, but all the songs are great. I would recommend this album to anyone with an open mind."
2,This Movie is More Dead Than Alive,"I purchased this movie because most of the reviews were at least four stars. It claims to be the goriest film made. I think it just stinks. Yes, it would get an A+ for blood and guts but that is about it. After awhile the blood and guts get on your nerves because the acting is awful. Dont waste your money."
2,Dissapointing,"If you expect a good horror film, you will be sorley dissaopinted. If you expect a comedy with so-so special effects, you will love it. Granted, it does have its comedic moments like the arate priest or the persistent headless nurse, but it also has waaayyy too stupid ideas to make it even a decent movie (like the kid that is conceived and delivered by the zombie nurse and priest in a matter of hours or the zombie digestive tract).To me, it was a major dissapointment. I like Lucio Fulci's movies and the Evil Dead movies, but other than the ridiculous gore in this one, it cannot be catalogued as a horror film."
3,"GROTESQUE, DISGUSTING BUT HILLAROUS","THIS OFFBEAT PIECE IS NOT FOR THE SQUEMISH. THE BIGINNING DOES NOT PREPARE THE VIEWER FOR WHATS TO COME. HOWEVER, IF ONE CAN SURVIVE THE TORENTUAL WAVES OF BLOOD, ITS QUITE AMUSING. THE FOREIGN PERSPECTIVE IS REFRESHING."
5,you gotta see it,"ok, peter jackson proves himself once again(with meet the feebles, and bad taste, previously)to be the king of gore, fright, action, and dark comedy. if you never see any movies again, see these three i just listed! you cannot sleep for about a night if you see deadalive. you will probably vomit too. you absolutely must see this movie!!!!!5 stars!"
5,"Zombies, blood, guts and a lawnmower. Now that's a movie.",Dead Alive is Peter Jackson's second film and I think it's one of his best. I highly recommend this film to any gore buff out there. This is a must buy and be sure to purchase the unrated edition. It's much gorier.
1,"Great movie, awful DVD","A great over-the-top horror movie by director Peter Jackson. Unfortunately though, the DVD mastering process went horribly wrong. While the quality is actually very good, especially for a 1993 movie, you can basically only touch the remote to start playing but you better not do anything afterwards because the DVD will go out of sync, and will not restore to normal playback. If you skip ahead to a scene, you will only hear some stuttering audio but video will not come up. All the other 83 dvds I own do not expose this problem so it's definately not my player. Wait for a re-release !"
3,ummm,"pretty bad B movie, only worth it for the last 25 minutes or so....viewer discretion is advised..."
2,Not so good,"I had heard good things about this cult favorite and I wanted to see it because of its popularity. But, like any film (especially cult favorites), you are either going to love it or not. I happen to be one that does not love it.Yes, there is gore and lots of it. You would think all of the gore might make the film good since it may enhance the other aspects of the film. But the other aspects of the film were simply complete nonsense and chaos with nothing else. Humor was intended but lacking. It could have even been better if it was actually disturbing. Without a mere semblance of reality though, disturbing can not even be used to describe the film.I gave 2 stars as a rating because I do not think this film is the worst zombie flick ever, but I do think the potential it had was left uncovered."
3,Not Worth Waiting For,"I purchased this dvd with high expectations , only to be dissapointed. It took nearly 3 weeks to arive , has no chapter insert in the box , and the dvd has no logo or writing.The film itself should be classed a a comedy as it is funny not scary. There is an unusualy high gore content which is good and when puss is squirted into a man's custard is a nice touch.My advice ,Buy Cannibal Ferox a much better buy for your money.Laterz"
2,"Pee Wee Herman, Psycho, The Fly, slapped together","Boy, this feels like Pee Wee Herman, Psycho, The Fly, all slapped together. I don't like the idea of ""trying to make it seem funny"", which is the slapstick aspect of this movie. The main actor and main actress kissed so passionately even when there is zombie gut and blood all over their faces... oh well, apparently they knew it was just chocolate syrup."
4,Best of low budget,"Well, I remember seeing this when I lived in a neighborhood that was not unlike living amongst dead people. This movie is by far one of the best low budget B-movies I have ever seen. Peter Jackson has once again used his imagination over expensive props and special effects and stuck with the corn syrup blood and mustard container squeezing sound effects! Excellent job, this is a classic."
1,Worst movie I have ever seen. Even this review is a waste of my time.,Absolutley horrible. That this movie aveages a 4 1/2 star rating perplexes me more then the thoughts of an afterlife or God's possible existance. What an incredible waste of money and time.
2,"Yucky camp, or campy yuck; does it matter?","This movie puts yuck into camp. One just has to wonder where ""fun"" will finally end up at; this one was over the top for me. The combination of ultra-gore, bad acting (intentional, one supposes?), rotten music (had me climbing the walls during the first 30 mins), and silly replayed zombie plot got me both bored and disgusted; a weird mix. If you get a thrill out of seeing body parts flying all over the place, with tons of reddish-pink paint, go for it. I suppose some people will get a yuck-yuck out of a couple dismembered body scenes... But really, there must be a better way to spend 100 min."
4,Gore galore!,"An early Peter Jackson film, made with a lot smaller budget than the Lord of the rings trilogy. I believe that most of the actors are from New Zealand or Australia.Lionel has a dominering(sp?) mother who wants to control every aspect of his life, however life has a way of changing when his mother is bitten by the evil rat monkey.In lionels words.... she's not dead, just rotting.Lionel has to save the girl that he loves at the end in very dramatic fashion, after most of the townspeople are infected with the same undead poison as Lionel's mother.There is plenty of blood and guts in this film, not for the weak at heart.I really liked it though."
3,jackson better days,"dead alive is one of peter jacksons legendary gore flicks. Unlike other zombie, walking dead films this is about a rabbit monkey that is hunt down and put into a zoo. When bitten by the creature you catch a sickness and slowly rott. The gore in this film is like no other, similier to his previous film ""badtaste"" it catches you totally off gaurd and even to the hardest horror fanatics this film with make you sick. Its a most for the gore lovers out there."
5,I HOPE YOUR TV HAS WINDSHEILD WIPERS !,"Peter Jackson's ""DEAD-ALIVE"" is an over the top cult classic horror zombie comedy that delivers 100% of the gory goods for the true hounds! Funny as hell! Peter Jackson is the man!"
2,Tell Me Something Pretty,"I just began reading ""Tell Me Something Pretty"" but I doubt I'll be able to finish it. Although the story is compelling, the frequent typos and misspellings distract me so much that I lose more and more respect for the author and editor with every page. This book was obviously not proof-read, at least not by someone with a command of the English language. I'm disappointed."
1,The worst product ever...,"this is the worst dvd/vcr player i have ever had and seen... after couple of months it is not working even though it is ""sony""Dont buy it you will be very dissapointed...P.S 1 Star because i couldnt vote for less.."
3,The defining moments of his life are largely ignored,"I first read this book when I was in elementary school and devouring every book I could find. At the time, I found it very good as it appealed to the historical view of Abraham Lincoln that our teachers gave us. However, as I reread it now I see how limited it is, with the concentration on his childhood and almost nothing about his leadership during the American Civil War. This was the defining moment for Lincoln and one of the few moments in the history of the United States where it could have ceased being a country. Therefore, while it reads easy and is understandable, many of the most significant points in the life of Lincoln are missed."
2,Might be good for beginners...,"I'm a fairly experienced developer who's fairly new to Struts. I've been learning on my own, but felt a great desire for something to give me a boost. I heard a few good things about this book, so I bought it rather excitedly -- after all, it's the newest book, so it ought to be the most complete, right?I found this book *seriously* lacking. Its example applications are trivial and its explanation of anything Struts is almost completely superficial. As an example, the book claims to cover Struts 1.1 but didn't mention Map-backed ActionForms at all -- and hardly mentioned DynaForms, other than showing one simple example.In summary, the writing style is quite good, the introductory material fair, but the detailed coverage is abysmal."
1,Disorganized junk,Completely useless as a reference book. Very disorganized. OK as a basic introduction - then you can basically throw it away - or sell for 92c which is the going price for a used copy and it's no wonder.
2,Not the best Struts book,"I needed a book on struts as I was beginning a new position. With limited time, I had to rely on the local book store. Not a good idea since this book was the only available book. I should have ordered online and waited.The lack of detail is truly amazing. Use this tool, but don't describe the steps needed to compile the java created by the tool. Use this tool to create the JSP, but what if you don't have that tool and are limited to the tools you can use?Since the tool generated code is required before compiling the included source code - that is a glaring omission. While the use of ant may be expected of many java programmers - setting up ant to complete the examples is not, especially given the complexity of the resulting xml file.Disappointed would be a polite way of describing my reaction"
2,Guessing with struts,"I'm totally surprised at the good reviews this book has been given. I purchased it based on those reviews and now ... well. The book is wordy and lacks some basic get you started information you would expect from a book with a title containing the words ""kick start."" The authors got it part right - it should read, ""Start kicking."" The authors seem to be upholding a long-standing java tradition: make it complex and avoid fundamental procedural steps. For what its worth, when I'm learning something new - upfront - I need to take baby steps - confidence builds and learning is accelerated on and up. Chapter 3 dives directly into a ""hello world"" application without one single word in the entire book devoted to ""Here is what you need to follow along boys and girls..."" Not one line of ""before we begin, do this and do that."" So if your looking for a good text on ""guessing with struts"" look no more. I give it two stars because there must be some value somewhere in these pages."
2,Clearly not her best...,"I'll make this review brief:Cather didn't know how to write very well when she put this novel together. I have read iher style here as being comparable to Henry James... no way. This novel is too short, too abrupt, and too lacking in the details needed to pull off decent character motivation, somethng I find vital to novels dealing with infidelity and love.The scenes read as disjuncted and they do not develop very well. If you want a short Cather novel that is better and want to avoid the commonplace Death Comes for the Archbishop, then try ""My Mortal Enemy"" This shows Cather off at the better end of her career."
2,Disappointing,"These earphones are not the best that Audio Technica has produced. Their ck7 is a better product for less money. I believe that it is a design problem. They may be too small for their own good. The should fit in the ear better based upon the angle that it is designed to fit into the ear. It seems that the neck out to be longer and come with a bigger sized ear gel or ear foam piece to ensure better sound isolation. When I tinker with them in the fitting, I can achieve a pretty good sound with better than adequate bass response that is pretty tight and precise, but it is so difficult to achieve the proper fit. I have noticed the same problem with the CK10.Because of these problems, I have not been willing to give their double or triple armiture earphones a try. They are just too expensive to simply try them out knowing that most vendors will not take earphones back for hygene reasons. The CK7's are really a good deal."
4,I love mine,"Great Pic as noted. Very good sound not great but better than most. Sony remotes are kind of buggy. The remote sensor on the TV is at the very bottom so it can easily be blocked. No S-VIDEO as noted but this is no problem if all you want to do is hook up a DVD player. I have 2 from garage sales each costed less than $20, easy to find at garage sales. If your camera is S-Video you'll be out of luck. Great bedroom TV. Watched Master and Commander on it and it was very nice."
3,European-style fantasy metal,"Dawnrider are like most of the metal bands I've heard lately; solid enough for you to bang your head for an hour after a tough day at work, but nothing to get overly excited about. The guitar work is good, not spectacular with a few decent solos interspersed throughout the songs. The riffs are fairly tame and start to sound alike as you near the end of the CD. The vocals aren't bad. There are a few different voices to be heard, the main one reminds me of the singer for Sisters of Mercy, but not as deep. Lyrically the songs are of the sword and sorcery variety which I like when well done although many of the songs here are fairly cheesy. ""Fate is calling"" is a big bold slice of European-style fantasy metal and it does its job fairly well."
4,"Great textbook, easy flow","I took a community college class to learn Spanish and this book was very helpful. I only gave it 4 stars because there are a few exercises that seemed useless at the time and there is a running dialog (from a videotape?) that seemed less than helpful. Overall, I really enjoyed the flow of the book (starting with the basics and moving forward). Learning the grammar basics etc, was easy with this book."
4,off beat is a good title,"This movie is far fetched in terms of plot so step back, suspend reality and enjoy. `Crash' has dreams, and these are pivotal to the story. Carried along by fate, `Crash' cares about the people his ambulance scrapes off the streets. The victims of life sometimes don't make it, and this becomes brutality evident. The movie ends up being I think, life affirming and optimistic (without being sentimental).The young actors do a fantastic job, and it is an empathy for their characters that makes this an enjoyable film. Matthias Schweighofer does a great job as `Crash'. Jessica Schwartz is wonderful, she was a very brave young woman to do a nude sex scene whilst nearly 9 months pregnant. Jessica was also the prostitute, killed for her sent in the movie `Perfume'. So, this is a bit strange and quirky, and it didn't work for me all the way through, but I thought it was memorable"
3,Ok in most instances,"I have used this USB 2.0 four port hub for several years without problem. It was connected to a first generation iMac, which had only three 2.0 ports. Today I was setting up a new iMac, 6th generation, I believe (Snow Leopard OS). My outboard drives wouldn't load. When I disconnected the hub and connected the drives directly to the iMac, everything was fine."
4,History Plus,The first season of Heimat is an informative view of German history from the end of World War I to 1982. Vivid recreations of the days of Hitler and World War II.
1,Threw it the trash!!!!!!!! 1967 edition,Dr Mcmillen told a a patient a women who had been beaten by her husband. That she should give into her husband and she will find life and worthwhile hapiness. She told him she was leaving her husband and responded by asking is that kind of love that suffers long and is kind. There are distortions and to the average reader aren't credible. I threw it into the trash
5,Chris Knight,"This feels good. Far from all the clinical clean productions, we have here an honest, real country album, talkin' about friends, life, hometowns, farms, sins, murder, cops. Sung with all the honesty and frankness of someone who knows what he's talkin' about. He seems to have lived everyone of these songs. The lightest song on this CD is ""Summer Of '75"" but it still fits perfectly in this effort. The most rock song here is ""Hammer Goin' Down"" with excellent guitar pieces. If you like this genre, better hurry to grab this album because you know what happens with artists like this, they disappear way too early because they don't fit in the usual Nashville productions."
3,Helps with test but quality is terrible,"I used this book to pass the exam. The topics covered on this exam are varied and obscure. This had to be a difficult book to write. However, that doesn't excuse the tremendous and glaring amount of errata. If you look carefully at each chapter, that chapter's author is revealed by the Real World boxes and the writing style. Tony Northrup writes well and covers the material with minimal errors--he gets 5 stars. Shawn Wildermuth writes decently, has more errors and doesn't cover material in great depth--3 stars. Bill Ryan's chapters, well, imagine a smart but poorly organized college student who attempts to write a term paper that was assigned two months ago in one night. It's kind of like that--1 star."
2,Mediocre,This song was somewhat cool but they still suck and still itis not very good even what happens to them.Lyrics 4/10 Production 1/10 Overall 2.5/10
4,"Cute book, somewhat limiting","I love Dover activity books for their small size (great to fit in the purse to bring with places) and affordable price. I bought this book as a stocking stuffer. I was a little disappointed by the fact that instead of allowing the child to decide how to place the stickers (and allow them to create their own special picture) each part of the nativity is numbered and outlined on the sticker board. Not a big deal, but different from the previous books we've bought."
1,Phone Activation # is bad!!!,Currently I am deployed to Iraq and do not have internet access so I tried the 1-800 #.It would be nice to be able to activate the game by phone but the Toll Free Number goes to a toll free phone sex number. Maybe that is why the game is rated for ages 17 and up. If anyone knows the real activation Toll Free # please let me know. This game gets my lowest rating for the incompetence of South Peak to provide a Phone # that works to activate the game.
1,Really Dull,"It's obvious they know the cameras are there, so you know they act more a fool than if they were not being filmed, aren't all realty type shows becoming this way, the more a performance you put on, the more on screen time you will get, hence it all seems an act."
1,The Most Degrading Movie Ever!,"Ok. This movie has to be one of the WORST movies ever! Its about 16 college students and their spring break vacation in Cancun, Mexico. It's extremely embarassing and degrading, though most guys will probably enjoy this trash. Basically, this is a more professional verson of ""Girls Gone Wild"", only with guys included. It's just a watered-down porn flick for the theaters. It's not even worth watching. I would really give this zero stars. Its amazing what they can get away with these days."
1,SAD AND DEPRESSING BUT IT'S IN FOCUS,"Sixteen vapid, semi-attractive, alleged college students head to Cancun for Spring Break and act like idiots while the camera rolls. This soft porn exploitation is weirdly grim, pointless, contrived, shallow, embarrassing, and devoid of joy, wit or charm. The characters are cyphers without human interest. And the music is even worse. I gave it one star because this very sad and depressing film is in focus."
5,"Watch a Great Master in Action, Caught Just in Time","I concur with the other reviewers' comments mostly. However, the entire recital is available on CD and if you want to hear all of it, buy the CD. I say ""just in time"" in the title because the recital clips are literally Milstein's last public recital in 1986 at age 82. Soon afterward he fell and badly broke his left wrist, abruptly ending the longest career of any great violinist. The miracle is how well he plays at age 82. Most violinists would be happy to play so well at any age. : - )If you are violinist, you really have to own this program. Never have I seen any other violinist (not even Heifetz) with such an efficient technique. Milstein had literally eliminated all extraneous left hand movements from playing the violin. It is wondrous to watch him playing the Sarasate Introduction and Tarantella. In the fast Tarantella you see his fingers seem to move not too quickly at all, while the notes fly by at a very rapid clip. Astounding."
4,well made,"I was replacing a similar tool that I was unable to find, made by Stanley. The Corona version seems very well made, and it has the Cut N Hold feature that I liked so well on my original. My only complaint... it doesn't open wide enough so it limits the size of growth you can clip."
1,toy pruner,"If you are a serious gardener, this is NOT a tool for you! I read the reviews, and thought it sounded plausible. It is for snipping stems the size of clematis flowers.....not for pruning."
4,Great movies bad packaging,I love both of the movies. Both of the movies are on the list of Disney theatrical animated features released films The rescues is number 23 and the rescuers down under is number 29. The packaging is meant to only highlight The rescues. I just wish they put equal importance in the Displays for the Blu-ray on both films.
5,Follow The Stars Home,A most heart warming book. I wish she had followed it through a little more. You really care about these people and want to know how things turned out for them. I'll admit I cried when I read it. I really liked Stella the Cat and Orion the Dog they added some humor to the story.
5,Touching,"This was an excellent book and very well written. I was transported to Gull Point, CT and I felt that I was walking along with the characters and I could see Julia and Amy. It's sad that there really are parents out there who walk away from their children but it gives me hope that there are some who will pick up that ""bad"" apple and carry on with love."
1,I Stand with Fellow Reviewers - on this one,"I, too, am an ardent Perry Mason fan.I, too, am OUTRAGED by the price gouging for Season 8, Volume 2.Five Stars for Perry Mason, the original series.ZERO stars for Paramount and Amazon for perpetrating this consumer outrage."
5,Perry Mason ROCKS!,"My DH's favorite TV show....so of course, I started getting him the collection. Don't know what we'll do when I've got all of the seasons..."
1,Price and Quality,I agree with those who have said (a) the product is defective (box and DVD don't match) and (b) the price is absurd.
3,Not a Perry Mason Fan,Just that its Ok. Never watched Perry Mason when they were orginally release. Too staged and too theatrical. One was the same as the others.
4,Romans (MacAthur Bible Studies),This study has great word definitions with each section of Scripture. I also enjoy having the NKJV in the study guide. It gives another version along with the ESV and NIV that the ladies in my bible study also use. Unleashing the Text and Keys to the Text are a really great resource. My group is also enjoying the divided studies that allow for easier and more complete every week without stopping mid lesson. I also find my ladies are more apt to get homework finished with shorted sections of scripture to digest. Would highly recommend this study as a second leaders guide if not for the entire group.
2,Shallow,Is work is for beginner Christians. It is milk and not so much meat. The author tries to summarize too much on important issues. It is as if he tired of study before finishing the work. It is probably good for younger group studying Romans for the first time.
5,Not too shabby,"I have a two year old and he didn't like to read potty books (except for everbody poops), but I just couldn't get his rear to that toilet seat! This book he actually likes (he loves the noises at the end) and the interactivity of it. And, for a mother, I like that it says ""he tries and tries"" because it is a frustrating thing for a kid!"
2,"Can be useful, better when you also use Pimsleur","Being a ""devotee"" of the Pimsleur method of learning languages, I inevitably compare all other products to that.These CDs provide quite a bit of good information and explanation, the speech is very clear, and the vocabulary and phrases are refreshingly useful after working through ten Pimsleur CDs talking about how I would like to order two beers. (And I still couldn't introduce myself...)But the Pimsleur methodology can't be beat and is much better at building a language structure upon which you expand. In CHINESE on the Move, the instructors are so busy blabbing and explaining that you don't end up speaking very much yourself, even though they tell you to.Suggestion: Do the Pimsleur Intro first, then use these as an extremely valuable supplement."
5,Delighted,"Had to take a few notes at first to learn the ins and outs of the software, but you really can do just about anything with it that you can think up. It works with Word software very well and does even more. Very pleased. Lessons in the manual very easy and a useful quick way to learn."
1,Not up to Seiko standards,"I bought this clock based upon the Seiko name. I've had two Seiko watches and found the quality to be outstanding. I was very disappointed to see that this is a CHEAP plastic clock. It is not ""metallic"" as described in the website. We sent it back."
1,Dissappointment (and Made in China),"Clock is cheap and tacky. Bought for a gift and must return it or use it for some garage sale. The GLOWING reviews for this clock are a clear indication that Amazon is allowing dishonest reviews by professional reviewers. To top it off, we discovered the clock is made in Commie China. Why would we want to reward this abusive government for their attrocious human rights and environmental behavior?? The same people who approved the massacre of tens of thousands innocent students in Tienamen Square are still running things, and if one has any doubt, just look at how they have raped Tibet. No more Seiko for us!"
3,Interesting experimental rock,"full of textures, incredible drumming , huge bass riffs and a voice that did not seem annoying to me. Any bozzio fan will like it. I liked a lot.Do not believe even in my own review before you listen to it."
4,"I love it, despite its faults","I love my pod coffee maker, despite the machine's flaws. If you don't get the pod in there JUST RIGHT, the water leaks out around the pod's edges and sprays out everywhere. After many false starts, I finally learned to really squish the pod down into the pod holder. I haven't been sprayed in months. I love how you can brew just one cup at a time, which is all I ever have. I switched to another brand of coffee pods, though--I think the Juan Valdez pods come in excessive packaging. Other pod brands work just as well in this coffeemaker, taste better, use less packaging, and are cheaper."
3,Good but really bad sound,"Well, I said it all, this is a real **HISTORIC** record, full of hiss,clicks etc, but still interesting"
2,Too Fast,"I grew up a few miles from Jackson, Mississippi, where Eudora Welty lived. All of my parent's generation had the same melodious Old South speech. This speech is not the caricature heard in movies; it's an almost aristocratic, even slightly British accent, and very hard to describe. I thought it had died out until I ran across an on-line example of Welty's readings. The slow cadence is an essential element. I was so disappointed when I heard this tape. Someone surely had told her - no, must have threatened her - to read as fast as she possibly could. How sad!"
4,Pretty decent sequel,"Having seen the first movie, and finding it a little tame in comparison with others, I purchased this DVD expecting more of the same, and was impressed by the good performance that Jean-Claude Van Damme brought. Bill Goldberg (as UNISOL Romeo) provided some scene-stealing moments both humorous and a little exciting. Although the plot is a little thin, and some back-story was incomplete(e.g. Devereaux's late wife), I thought this sequel was better than the original."
2,"Good Action, Bad Plot","I enjoyed the original Universal Soldier, but like most sequels, this one has much to be desired. I'm a big wrestling fan, so it was fun to watch Goldberg attempt to act out of the ring. He's about as talented actor as Van Damme himself (heh). The movie has a lot of action, so it gets some high points there, but the story line really isn't that good. It's an entertaining movie, but the original is far superior."
1,A UNIVERSALLY STUPID MOVIE!,"This should have a minus rating, easily Jean Claude Van Dammes worst movie, (took a lot to take Street fighter off the number one spot! , Im amazed! )Believe it or not I dont happen to hate Jean-Claude, on the contrary I enjoyed his earlier work though not great, is very watchable. Unfortunately Universal Soldier 2 falls short, lack luster performances, and too many obnoxious scenes that make this movie too ridiculous to watch!I hope you will find yourselves something far more entertaining, like cutting your toenails its better than this, believe me! So try some of Jean-Claudes earlier work like No retreat no surrender or Bloodsport certainly better and more interesting that what is on offer!"
4,"One of these gulity pleasure sequels, you enjoy.","The Plot:After 13 years. Luc(Jean Claude Van Damme) is having an normal life, he has a twelve year old daughter, a job for the military and he more human than ever but he lost his wife from the first film. Everything is about to fall about when Seth(Micheal Jai White), a supercomputer controlled warrior, has control another Unisols to save and defend themselves. But they are dangerous, will be anything sent they goals. But Luc how to stop them, because he was the original Unisol. Bill Goldberg steals the film, when he appears in a scene, he gives an outrageous entertaining comic performance as Romeo, he`s one of the Unisols in the film.DVD`s has a good anomorphic widescreen(1.85:1) transer and Pan & Scan is also alivable. Excellent Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround with Strong .1 Lfe Bass just like Original Universal Soldier DVD. Including 3 Different Feaurette and Theatrical Tralier."
5,my favourite heartbreak,"I look forward to melancholy because it's made that much sweeter with Parker and Lily to score it. They make me lust for lonely and pine for sorrow. Parker the distant demon, croaks and cries his heart out over lethargic twang flung from his ancient guitar, whilst Lily, the one woman heavenly chorus, makes sweet this beautiful sad.Buy it for to cradle your heart this cold winter."
3,Good but not great!,"Too many people keep waiting for another ""Operation:Mindcrime"". That isn't going to happen and I don't expect it to happen. I personally wouldn't mind another album however that left me feeling the way ""Rage for Order"" did. Queensryche used to have a way of making you think, now it seems like your left thinking if the next album will be better. This is in my opinion, the third album of so-so material. Dump the striving for commercialism and start thinking before you write. While some of the tunes are catchy and musically interesting, the majority is pop music following a formula they seemed to have started adapting shortly after ""Mindcrime"". I can only hope they don't create another CD-Rom for this release although I'm not sure why the CD wasn't released as an enhanced version with some type of multi-media. Especially for an album called ""Q2k""."
2,QK2 is a disapointment...,"Queensryche, in trying to keep up with mainstream popularity, is continually changing their style, much to the dismay of their original audience. This album lacks the great melodies set by guitarist DeGarmo that was seen in prior albums Operation Mindcrime and Empire. Furthermore, this new album is missing the climatic choruses that Queensryche used to excel at. It seems that this band is trying to keep up with contemporary artists instead of relying on what made them popular in the first place. An overall disapointment... especially after reading that this new album will do what Def Leppard's Euphoria had done... back to their roots. Not happening."
3,good but lacks in comparison of their previous work,what happened here they used to be such an awsome band but you almost get the feeling they just threw this toghether for some cash there's some good songs but it's lame compared to their earlier stuff
2,"Listened to it for weeks, and still bad.","Well, I've listened to the CD for a couple of weeks, now, and most of it is still unbearable. The only saving grace now (besides a mediocre ""Falling Down"") that has come with multiple daily listening is the three song group of ""Beside You"", ""Liquid Sky"" and ""Breakdown"", and of those, ""Beside You"" is truly the only memorable one. After those three songs, I just hit rewind, and play those three songs over again. ""When the Rain Comes"" and ""How Could I?"", and the last three songs might as well not even be on the CD, because they're unremarkable and truly forgettable.Where's Chris DeGarmo's new band? All of a sudden, ""All I Want"" from HITNF doesn't seem so bad."
1,WOT HAPPENED TO MY (former) FAVORITE BAND?,"I can only repeat what I see is the consensus here. I bought the CD. It was lame. I've loved Queensryche since I heard ""Gonna get close to you"" and I'm afraid it has stopped with ""Sign of the Times"". I even tried not comparing this album to others. But the lyrics are trite, the guitar riffs all sound similar and there's none of the interesting sound effects that made them an original.I miss Chris!"
2,Wot Kind Of Band Are You?,"Q2K is the best Soundgarden album I've heard in years.I wish I could blame former guitarist Chris DeGarmo for QR's ever disheartening spiral into the ugly abyss that is ""90's rock"", but with this latest effort, they've successfully continued the dronesludge borefest they started with HITNF.Could someone play a real solo, please? How about some tempo changes? Perhaps a riff or two? What happened?I guess when grunge blew up and died in Seattle, a big festering chunk landed on Queensryche. New guitarist Kelly Gray was quoted as saying they're putting the ""***"" back in Queensryche (whatever that means). Sounds like they succeeded."
4,Q2K goes in a different direction-but it's still Queensryche,"People who disappointed because this isn't another Mindcrime or Warning are missing the point. If those albums could be duplicated they wouldn't be as great as they are. One thing that makes Queensryche so good is that each new album is different than their previous efforts. This is not their best album, but I didn't expect to be. After a few listens a true Queensryche fan will like this album. Q2K is not perfect, but it has it's moments with songs like How Could I, Liquid Sky, Breakdown, and The Right Side of My Mind."
5,Takes a few listenings but is worth the time.,"I found the cd a little hard to get at first. Listening to it over and over catching all the music makes it very enjoyable. I miss Degarmo's guitar, but I'll get use to it. This band reminds me of how Rush grows and grows. I can't wait until the next CD."
1,Where's the real Queensryche?,"I've been a Queenryche fan since the first EP and I don't know how to review this record. This is not the real Queenryche for me. This must be a very bad clone. If you're looking for a first record to buy go for ""Operation Mindcrime"". If you can afford two go for ""Empire"". If money is no subjet when you're talking about great music, buy the first five records and PLEASE avoid ""Hear in the Now Frontier"" and this one. As I said this is not the Real Queensryche."
1,WHAT HAPPENED,"I do not know what happened to Queensryche after Empire. Did they take some substance that made them start a slow, and I most say, painful process into becoming horrible song writers. It started with Promised Land, which had a few classics, then HTNF, which had maybe one song that I can actually remember the words to, and this effort. WOW is it bad. I heard it on the internet last night and said to myself; it has to sound better on CD. NOPE. It is pure garbage. I have front row tickets to their show in San Jose and am just praying that they stick to the classics and play very little off of this effort. My advice to Queensryche is find a cure for whatever happened to, what used to be the most thought evoking band ever; that now is turning out mindless drivel. Unless they want to be remembered for torturing their loyal fans with one piece of garbage after another."
3,Rock-a-bye Baby,"Were you onboard in the 80's or did you only get into QR after Silent Lucidity? I am the most rabid QR fan I know, but, let's face reality here, this is not the pick-me-up we needed after HITNF. Two yawns in a row is enough to make me want to cry. Sure, different is good, but I need something with energy and thought provoking lyrics to keep me interested. Where's the edge? It kills me to say this but this CD puts me to sleep. It's not interesting at all. Compare the writing and playing on the Warning to Q2K and tell me something hasn't gotten lost. I'm bummed about this CD and the apparent demise of my favorite band. Let know if you feel the same."
2,slow book,"This is the second book by Reich that I have read, and again this book is very slow. The plot is easy to figure out, Reich can be very very long winded at times. This book reads more like a screen play than a novel. Worth reading I like I did only on a long plane trip."
2,Not a Good Buy,"I recently bought this game. I felt I paid way to much. The graphics are on par with the orginal Delta force. The gameplay is week. Frustrating enemy ai will snipe you from miles away with an ak. Along with many other problems. The voice acting is bad, and the story is weak. Over all only buy if you want a very hard challenge and its in a bargian ben."
3,"Real reviews, please","It is interesting that reviewers J. Shimko and Jon Equrrola have identical reviewer rank, and that they only review books by Gavin JT Powell.I'll wait for less suspicious and more informative reviews to be posted before considering this book.Since I must give a rating in order to post a review, I am giving the book 3 stars because the existing reviews have neither honestly extolled its brilliance nor decried its awfulness, so I am guessing its quality is average."
2,Not a Good Purchase,"I thought I was getting something professionally transferred onto dvd and was upset that the reproduction of these disks is terrible. The background noise is deafening, film blurry and scratchy and volume non existant. For the money it's not worth purchasing and the seller should have done a better job by editing properly - the old US adds are not necessary, and by making picture clearer and deleting the background noise that at time takes over the entire show making it imossible to watch.Do not waster your money."
3,Minimalist pop from Unrest guy,"Although Mark Robinson has released previous CDs that were essentially solo releases (""Olympic Death Squad"" et al), this is his first full CD under his own name. Mark is the head honcho of Teenbeat Records and was leader of Unrest as well as Air Miami and other ensembles. TIGER BANANA is an enjoyable disc, consisting mainly of Mark singing softly, accompanied only by his own electric guitar chords. The guitar chords are usually very simple, but the vocal melody is always woven in nicely, resulting in a very pleasing sound. I do recommend you save the outer CD card, since the digipak contains almost zero information about the CD -- no song list, no album title -- nothing except a Teenbeat catalog listing."
4,Difford puts the Squeeze on his old sound,"Chris Difford's solo album sound absolutely nothing like Squeeze. For that I'm eternally grateful. Don't get me wrong, I love Squeeze but Difford's approach here sparks with vitality and has a hint of freshness I wouldn't have expected. Working with Francis Dunnery as his co-writer has freed up Difford to develop both as a vocalist and songwriter. He's never sounded so uninhibited as a singer.From the unusual gay anthem ""Cowboys Are My Weakness"" to the remake of ""Electric Trains"" with a more C&W; feel to it, Difford inhabits all of his characters and brings them to life. One of his gifts as a songwriter is to put you in the shoes of the character he's created. Sure, he and Tilbrook were nearly perfect together as a songwriting team still it's nice to see both of them stretch out a bit and try their hand at something a bit different."
5,I will never use another litter!,"This litter is amazing... absorbent, dust-free, and reduces odors like magic.Plus, it's safe for my rabbit, which is the biggest plus yet."
4,Berlin,"Berlin is a writer's melting pot of detail, experience and imagination. For the reader; such vivid storytelling should require a mental Checkpoint Charlie from time to time. Michael Mirolla's thought blender finds you spinning in a dream, then a nightmare, by the reality of it all. Berlin unfolds like magic, your mind is glued to each page, but the hand wants to work quicker than the eye. Mirolla's strange trip will leave you addicted to gravity, as you find yourself on the high wire of emotion with no safety net."
5,great book,I am a psychiatrist and loved reading this book. It opened my eyes to the importance of the father's role in parenting and I greatly enjoyed reading his personal accounts with his son and how he was able to continuously tie in parenting concepts. Dr. Greenberg clearly displayed his passion for being a father and wrote in a very down to earth yet not overly simplistic manner. I recommend this book to both professionals and new parents.
1,So disappointing and so shocked..!,"I ordered this watch but this seller sent me the wrong item! they sent me a small earrings which was not even real silver. i emailed them and sent it back quickly and they finally refunded. but that was scary and stressful.. i am now scared of the happenings again but i tried to order one more time, and hopefully i will receive the correct item this time."
3,pretty watch,"pretty watch, i get lots of compliments on it. i had the watch for 1 week and the battery died. i had to go back to the jeweler for a replacement."
4,THE TITLE SAYS IT ALL!,"The only problem I have with Fountain and ""the late and great"" Al Hirt is they never made actual New Orleans jazz albums. And by that I mean they never played with the usual setup (A piano, trumpet\cornet, Trombone, Banjo\Guitar, Clarinet and so on) at least the albums I have by them. I still enjoy Fountain's albums though and think he is one of the best. My favorite tracks are ""High Society"",which is a very old New Orleans song played back in the day of Morton and maybe even before. This song has the traditional setup that I'm talking about. Pete's solo is nothing short of terrific. Then there's "" Bye Bye Bill Bailey"" which also is played with the traditional backup. For something differnt there's ""China boy"" the velocity the group plays at might not be or ever be matched. It really is ""The Best of Pete Fountain""!"
4,Decent jungle adventure,"Between my school library and the public library, there weren't that many GYG books available to me, but I remember my friend bought about twelve of them and I mooched them off of him every now and then to read (or just look at the pretty covers). Therefore, this book stuck out in my mind as one he definitely had. All that said, it was pretty great. I liked the jungle setting, which reminded me a lot of the island setting from the Tiki Island one. There were a lot of third parties in this book including Amazon Warrior Women, some big-game hunters, a jungle tribe, and a troll. The two storylines involve either turning into a fish-creature or getting lost and encountering all the above parties. A decent, if not terribly awesome, GYG book."
4,Excellent Manual,Manuel has lots of good information and more than paid for itself when it came to DIY or taking it to the shop
5,Affecting,"Enjoyed Selby's prose...Tried to pick up another book after finishing ""Brooklyn"" and couldn't concentrate. Not for the squeamish or closed-minded. Definitely a re-read down the road."
2,I Guess I missed Something,"I have read many books, some the best or most thought provoking ever to be put to paper. Others were found to be the worst waste of tree bark that one could imagine. But in all the books I have read, never have I questioned ones reason for being. I am a firm believer of the need of books that awake ones mind to the less then perfect American picture of life. I had never read or heard of Mr. Selby before this book. His constant pounding on the Homosexual theme I found tiresome. I thought he had something in his story called, ""Strike"", but found it also dragged down into the mire of dogma.Even in the darkest of stories taken from life there is some hope. Selby writes one of the most brutal, hateful novels I have ever read. I may not agree with a homosexual lifestyle, but I have found them to be people who live, their lives in the dignity of their choice.If this book was meant to do anything but degrade them I guess I missed it."
3,Leaves much to be desired...,"My largest complaint towards this album is its predictability. Prior to its release, I was anxious about whether or not it would turn out like Soundtrack to Your Escape or be even lighter than Figure #5.The good news is: I'd say that Soilwork is heavier...or maybe just louder...than Natural Born Chaos. BUT the songs are SO damn predictable -> Scream the Verse, Sing the Chorus, Repeat with no noteworthy exceptions, Have a Bridge, A lackluster solo...Boom a Soilwork song.You may say that's the way it's always been. Ok, listen to A Predator's Portrait, Natural Born Chaos, or even Figure #5 tell me something didn't get lost along the way.I did, however, think the drumming was pretty kick ass."
3,Let's not get carried away here...,"Okay, it this a good Soilwork albumn? Sure. It's basically just like Natural Born Chaos and Figure No 5...so if you like Soilwork, you'll like this. If you get bored of their same old sound, then you'll want to skip this. I bought it, because of the clean vocals...I just wish they'd break the formula every once in a while...you know...the raspy song/clean chorus formula. It just gets old. The pace of every song seems to be the same.I wouldn't say this CD is bad...but if you need something fresh, this isn't it. It's not great either...it's just Soilwork. If you want something really fresh, check out Atrocity's latest ""Atlantis"" now that is a heavy CD with all sorts of sounds on it."
5,Can't expect any less,"Quite possibly the album of the year for me, but the year has a long way to go. Not a single bad or boring song on the album. All the songs KICK ass.GET IT, GET IT NOW!!"
5,Amazing,"I bought this cd a while ago and it has grown to be one of my favorite cd's. This cd is very heavy and at times somewhat melodic.My favorite track is ""Stabbing the Drama"" very catchy song, and this is the song I would recommend listening to first if you haven't heard soilwork. Buy this album it's a must have if you like heavy music."
4,Enjoyable,This ablum is a bit heavier than their previous album but continues the chorusing and hard sometimes inspirational bursts. Observation Slave is probably the best track in my opinion along with memorable intro and second track. Also there are others in there that are better than average but not excellent. The album sounds good. its 3.5 but I round up since math told me so.
1,LA Listener wants money back,"Glampire's 'Beggining of Terror' was the worst 14 dollars I ever spent. It lacked originality, creativity and to be honest, talent. If I want to listen to the Cure, or NIN, I will buy the original, not some cheezy knock-off. Do not buy."
2,Sayonara,"I would like to suggest that closer attention be paid to proof reading. For the cost of the book, it wasn't carefully done. Also, the quality of the book was not up to my expectations. I realize that most hard copies are no longer in print, but if you are offering them, then the quality should be much better."
1,Glory to God Alone: The Life of J.S.Bach,"The movie is ok, but low-key and not the highest quility. Feels like it is done by amateur movie-makers. I was hoping to show it in music class, but wasn't able to find anything ""catchy""."
3,Dust catcher,"The binoculars came with only two lens caps, both loose and always falling off (one has disappeared). The lenses attract dust and need to be wiped frequently with a lens cloth. It seems that these pricy, high quality binoculars should have lens caps that are attached, as with a camera lens cap."
2,"remastering job great, but edited version on atmosphere HORRIBLE","the remastering job and cover art and liner notes are great, but westbound edited the beginning of atmosphere. i bought this version instead of the import because i read that the import had this edit also, so i figured that westbound wouldn't make the same mistake but they did. the edit is just stupid because it's only about 10 seconds they take off the beginning of the song and it makes no sense to do it.don't buy until you know for sure that the edit has been fixed."
2,Could've been stronger,A pathetically wack jam compared to all other 1960's and 70's P-funk. Get it last.
1,A piece of junk,"Got this ""helicopter"" for Christmas for my son. Out of the box you could see it was cheaply made - its mostly Styrofoam.Charged the battery for an hour - followed all the directions - the thing flew in circles for about 10 seconds and crashed. You have no steering control and the battery lasted about 3 minutes.I would recommend the old wheel and rubber band over this. Don't waste your money - luckily I did get mine back (less shipping of course)."
3,Ew,"I really, really didn't like this book. It presented good ideas, but I hated the writing style. It seemed preachy and bland. However, the issues that were adressed made up for its dryness."
4,The real deal......,"Dr. John is one of the truly great musicians of our time and this is a wonderful album--the only reason it gets four stars is that his genius really is in the funk realm of his New Orleans roots, even though he is excellent with a big band."
2,Not a Love for all Time,"This book is about Casey Farrow and Dan Murdock. Casey is cosmedics rep who is recovering from a terrible car crash that left her scared and frail. Dan Murdock is the one who ran into the back of her car on a foggy night and pushed her carinto a truck carrying a load of windows. The glass shattered and sent shards of glass over Casey's face and body. DanMurdock pulled Casey from the wreckage and saves her live.From the moment Casey wakes in the hospital Dan is by her side. He tells her that he feels as if they have been togetherin a past life. While this sound romantic, in this story it is realy creepy. Dan is an overbearing man that bulldozesover Casey and never gives her time to come to terms with her new life and her injuries.I did not like this ""hero"" at all."
2,Not the best I've ever read...,"This book is not terribly enlightening. Most of the advice is just practical common sense. However, it is worth reading for the advice on using coupons and finding discounted products. I would consider this book to be supplemental reading at best. There are much better books out there on managing finances and getting out of debt."
2,Middle strap too short and seat is flimsy,"Today was the first time my daughter used this seat and I was not pleased with it...so I came here to see the reviews. Needless to say, the exact things I didnt like are the same complaints others had. The middle strap is way too short!!! My daugther was sceaming also when I was trying to buckle it. The armrests are also flimsy and I was just waiting for the day until my daughter snapped them off. The sides also are weak. I just excepted more for the price...nothing like my Marathon Britax. Thanks everyone for validating my thoughts. I will be returning mine too."
1,Anchor strap not long enough for Honda,"The anchor strap that comes with this seat is made to 43""...about 6 or 7 inches shorter than any other maker. It will not fit my Honda Odyssey minivan. I contacted Evenflo and they said at this time there are no other options or ways to extend the strap. BOTTOM LINE: WASTE OF TIME BECAUSE I BOUGHT IT, THEN HAD TO TAKE IT OUT OF THE CAR, PUT MY OLD CAR SEAT IN TO TAKE MY KIDS WITH ME BACK TO THE STORE TO RETURN IT!! Beware if you have a minivan with the anchors under the seat!"
2,"Badly in need of restoration, but beautiful in parts","""The Snow Queen"" is a beautiful film - or could be, if it were ever fully restored to its original glory, and redubbed for modern audiences. It boasts a lovely musical score, and some of the animation is the equal of the best of Disney. But alas - this version is based off of a VERY old and damaged print, and that hinders the enjoyment considerably. This film deserves a full restoration so that new generations can enjoy this well-told tale based on a Hans Christian Anderson story. Its sweetness, imagery and production design is second to none. Hopefully some studio will undertake the task of bringing it back to life. As it is, I can't recommend this version. It's in very bad shape."
2,Wait for a restored version.,"While a very good film for the little ones, this DVD release is disappointing because it's from an unrestored print that's so murky and dark in places that some of the characters cannot be seen, except for some minor white highlights. Not worth buying."
3,It's good for what it is...,"This movie has sentimental value. I watched it and it served its purpose but it was difficult to see in some parts, as previous viewers have mentioned. I suppose having this copy is better than having no copy. I was more disappointed that it was not in Russian even though I knew when I bought it that it was the version with Sandra Dee. Still, I probably would have paid twice as much for the Russian version. [Three times as much if it was more visually pleasing]."
3,Meh,"The image quality is mediocre at best. The sound quality, again, mediocre at best. I actually have a VHS copy that's better overall quality. It would have been nice if someone actually made some kind of attempt at remastering this film. However, with all of this taken in stride, it's still worth the purchase."
1,Don't buy: verse prints out as prose,"The verse prints as prose. This should never have been offered. Sometimes it will be verse for a line or two, which makes the whole thing worse."
4,great stuff,"Barone is a very talented songwriter and performer. I loved his band, The Bongos, but his solo material is also very strong. This is a good place to start if you haven't heard him before. A also agree with the reviewer that wants to see his album with James Mastro, ""Nuts and Bolts"" released on CD. That one is a definite pop classic!"
4,Comes out smelling like a rose....,"Excellent on so many levels: an important chapter in London's history, well-developed characters, insights into the dogfighting underground, the then-little-understood traumatizing effects of combat, and the unseen engineering marvels of the sewers...It's a good book to settle into, and the plot never lags. I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys historical fiction or, for that matter, just good fiction."
3,Historical Knowledge plus Good Writing but with no Story to tell,The author's scholarly knowledge of England around 1850's is undisputable. She can also write well. Her descriptions are vivid and engrossing. They bring to life characters and places. The main weakness is the plot. The tale of murder and corruption and its resolution is contrived and artificial.
3,Cutting still happens,A sad tale which treats the disorder of having to cut oneself. Set in London's sewers it makes for an unusual and fascinating story
5,Powell Bed Frame,This item was as advertised. It was simple to put together and has nice adjustable foot supports in all 4 corners. If I needed another bed frame I would purchase another one of these.
4,Overboard,"I thought this book was really good. It's a little slow at the beginning, but it explains a lot about the rest of the book. I really never wanted to put this book down, but with only 15 minutes a day in class, it took a while to read. It was very suspenseful, but in a good, realistic way. Most books have severely dramatized situations, but with this one, it was a very descriptive scenario. The book kept me guessing the whole time. Just when I thought I had figured something out, it went a whole new direction with a whole new twist. In one part it gets a little gross, because the main character is pushed up against a dead body while she's caught in a whirlpool. But if you like suspenseful books, then I highly suggest this one."
4,Triumph of the human spirit,"It's easy to understand why Emily is angry at her parents and depressed, so her running away doesn't come as a big shock to the reader. What happens after she gets on the boat that's supposed to take her to meet her uncle is where things get tense. What this novel does is it shows the triumph of the human spirit while it puts into perspective just what the important things in life are."
1,Cheap-o,"Classic case (get it? case? har har) of 'you get what you pay for'.Dint expect much from this guy for the price, but figured it better than no case at all. I was pretty much on the money with that prediction. Not much protection from this guy. If youre looking for something rough and tough that will keep your phone alive and well for years to come, this is not your case.The case is thin and flimsy. Kind of scary to put on, and my fears were rewarded when the case finally tore trying to put the thing on for the 20th or so time (doesnt fit in an iPod cradle with the case on)My advice is to skip this case entirely and get a real case if you want one. This thing is like wrapping tape around your phone (until it tears and becomes entirely useless)"
4,"Classic, cute heels","Love these shoes. Practical enough to wear to work or on a night out. Not the most comfortable especially initially but very cute and classic. I bought my pair because a friend of mine recommended them, I still have mine while hairs mysteriously vanished at a party."
2,Not reader friendly,"This book is so unfriendly my professor suggested we sell the book back on the first day of class because she said we'd learn more from using journal articles as opposed to fighting through this book. It is very dry, dull, and set up in a confusing way."
2,"Great song to sample, fair execution","Notorious: Not the same song we've heard on MTV or BET. A very edited for content for radio play. A perfect song to sample, yet is not too spectacular. The other 2 songs are worthless. The rapper is inarticulate and sounds like he's drunk."
3,Good book- held my attention,"I enjoyed this book, but after reading The Shipping News, I found the same themes, and similar characters appearing. The story catches you up- and you do find yourself racing to finish, except at the end you don't necessarily come away feeling as ifyou have learned something. Still worth the money to while away the long winter's evenings!"
1,Accordian Crimes Disappoints,"Accordion CrimesI looked forward to reading this book as I had enjoyed The Shipping News so much. This was an extreme disappointment. It became very tedious and I found myself skimming large passages in the latter chapters. Also, it seemed like Proulx chose every kind of misery for her characters to endure, as well as the most sensational ways to die. The work could have benefited greatly by more disciplined editing."
2,disappointing,"I got tired of all the violence when Delor killed himself because he was so happy. Having the accordian smashed by a truck left me laughing and disappointed that no ends were tied up. Like the thousand dollar bills, everything was just left to blow away. What a farce!"
1,who cares,"This was a book chosen in our book club. I got to page 182 and it was a struggle. I just didn't care about any of the characters or their situations. I kept hoping the next chapter would be better. I usually read books in one or two days and when it took me over 3 weeks to get half way done I knew it was a loser. The other people in the book club all agreed, no one else could finish it either. We all said ""who cares"" when referring to the characters."
4,"Not a bad read, but not as good as ""The Shipping News.""","Annie Proulx is as master craftsman (craftsperson?) with words. Her sentences are magnificant and her dialog intricate and effective. This book, however, lacks a certain plot ""glue"" which it needs to hold it together. In ""The Shipping News"", one really comes to know the characters. This is not the case here. While each of the book's short stories is interesting, one finishes the book with the sense of leaving the table before dinner was complete"
1,So boring I forgot I was reading it,"First, let me say that I probably can't come up with 5 books in my life that I didn't finish once I started (I'm a finisher). This is one of them. Second, this is the first book I've ever forgotten that I was reading - seriously, something reminded me about this book and I thought to myself ""did I ever finish that?"" and I found the book and had gotten about halfway through (and I will say it was painful to get that far). The problem as noted by those that gave it a few stars was ""who cares?"" I didn't care for the accordians, people or anything else as everything was so forgettable - as I plodded along I'm asking myself ""why am I wasting my time here?"" and then eventually I must have picked up something else and truly did forget about it. I wanted to like this book, but never managed to care."
3,"Good, but somwehat formulaic and a dissapointing ending","The stories of the accordion owners get somewhat monotonous after a while. What keeps the reader engaged is the series of Hitchcockian scenes when he thinks this owner will discover the $14,000 secreted in the accordion. Sometimes she seems to paint herself into a corner where the only way to keep the story going is to kill the character, as happens to one would-be accordion repairman. As the accordion makes its way, it gradually decreases in value, ultimately becoming trash. This was disappointing to me and somewhat unrealistic, to think that no one would recognize the unusual work that had gone into its making, as poorly functioning and as tattered as it had become. As the book ends, the accordion gets smashed by a truck and we still don't know what will happen to the pieces nor who will find $13,000 of the $14,000."
2,Disappointing,"After reading all the raves about Shipping News (which I have not read), I found Accordian Crimes in the bargain bin of the local bookstore, so I thought I would give it a try. The book is readable, but it is essentially a collection of depressing (and troubling) short stories. I was expecting an actual NOVEL. The characters seem to be either horrendously unlucky or incredibly stupid. The plot would come to a conclusion just when I feel I am getting into the storyline. In short, I do not much care for it."
4,"Not as accessible as Shipping News, but then America wasn't","Despite the sheer awfulness of much that befalls the characters in this book, it is ultimately about the optimism and resilience that are the necessary attributes of the brave souls who take on the burden of settling in a heartbreakingly foreign land. It is 'Newfoundland' writ large."
1,An aggravating book,"The premise sounded really promising -- an accordian ends up in the hands of very different people in succession and bears witness to a part of each of their lives. But none of the characters were worth witnessing. Worse than that, however, was the annoying style in which the book was written. One paragraph might be made up of one unbelievably long run-on sentence, separated by lots of commas, while the next might be twenty short little sentences. It was too distracting -- particularly for a weak book that could not hold up under any distraction. Pass on this one."
2,So anxious to read this - but gave up twice.,"Annie Proulx's ""The Shipping News"" is one of my favorite books. A story so sharply written that I've held simple phrases in my head for years - unforgettable. I was thrilled to hear about ""Accordian Crimes"" and even broke my wait-until-it's-in-paperback rule. Forked over the bucks for the hardcover and took an afternoon off from work to dive in. Well - such a laborious, dry, unengaging read that I put it down after about 100 (or was it 1000?) pages. Tried again weeks later, thinking I wasn't in the right frame of mind the first time. Again - that wall of boredom. Either I just wasn't getting it, or there isn't anything to get. Got FABULOUS reviews in my area papers - maybe it's just me! (Try her others: Heartsongs, Postcards, Close Range - all very good.) I'm so sorry, Ms. Proulx, but I gave it my best!"
5,Priceless,"Excellent is an understatement! I originally received the ""tape"" over 13 years ago at my baby shower. I am overjoyed to find it on CD!! Even though my son is now a teenager, I loved the songs so much, I'm excited to return this CD to my collection for my own personal enjoyment. One of the best lullaby CD's ever made. The fact that it's also inspirational as well is a PLUS!"
5,Coco Tea still conscious after all these years,"People get ready for the man whose consciousness rivals the late great Mister Marley. Coca Tea presents us with with some lethal tunes that make one give thanks to Jah. Israel King is, no doubt, one of the better songs floating about the music scene. There's no Hope gives us hope that Coca Tea will be around longr still while Hurry Up and Come begs for Mr Tea to do that with some more tunes. Listen to this album once and you might want to locks the hair and live like how Jah intended you to."
1,I can't BELIEVE this dopey book got so many raves!,"As one other reviewer notes, it's incredibly poorly written. The info is not new, not helpful, not... well, let's just say I saw it a conventional (offline, independent) bookstore, thought it was a cute title, and, being as short on time that day as I almost always am short on sleep, I didn't leaf through it before buying it. MISTAKE!I really resented paying money for this piece of self-congratulatory-ness. I'm glad the author found something that worked for him, I'm glad he suffered and then interrupted the cycle: hooray for anyone who does that, in any area of life. But it sure didn't do anything for me, and didn't tell me anything I didn't know.Aggravating waste of trees."
2,code,not quite what I was expecting. A little far fetched in some parts. wondering where his sources came from.
5,Tommy Who?? :-) This is the one to get.,"I'll second the opinion of the previous reviewer. This is the Who album to get. Just about all of their best, tight, two-to-three minute songs are on here. I like this stuff a whole lot better than their overblown operas Tommy and Quadrophenia."
5,May Not Be Worth Your Trouble But Was Worth Mine,"Rarely when it comes to artists the caliber of the Who does the best representation of the group come from a singles collection. This is the case here however. Two caveats though; 12 of the 14 songs are available on the more representitive but much less cohesive My Generation - The Best Of The Who, and being now available only as an import stateside it may not be worth your trouble. Admittedly I'm not a big fan of the Who, but if you own this, Who's Next and Live at Leeds you have just about all you need from this band."
3,Fun game but basically the same as the other Hullaballoo,"We love the first Hullabaloo game so we ran out & bought this when my son received some birthday money to spend. I knew it would be similar but I didn't realize that they are basically the same game but this one uses the DVD. It is still great fun but if you already own the other one, don't bother buying this one. I much prefer the older version anyways because it is portable, you can take it outside or basically anywhere easily.I was very disappointed in the animal part of this game. We love animals & I really thought there would be some educational moments during the game but basically they just show very quick movies of a few animals. Nothing educational & really just distracting from the basic game.I would not recommend this game but rather the earlier version, the DVD is just a glorified version for more money."
4,"One of the best books, on a horrible mitake of a war.","David Christian is one of Americas Greatest War heros. He exemptlifies all the charecteristics of a hero. He is extremly couragous, calling in artillry on top of his position. And this is a very excellent book on a very couragous and heroic man."
3,not how I remember,"I used to wear this many years ago and would receive lots of compliments on it. I was wearing it when I met my husband and he really liked it. Then I couldn't find it anymore. I had about a 1/3 of a bottle left. My sister said perfume goes bad after a few years so I hunted down some more. However, after receiving a new ""fresh"" bottle I've discovered I prefer my aged version. It's much more mellow. So to the back of the cabinet this one goes to be retrieved many years from now..."
3,Book is in great condition,I have several Al-anon meditation books I read daily and have not had a chance to really read it but plan to put in my daily reading
4,Affirmations to look inside....,Sometimes my self esteem needs a little nurturing and positive input to help my daily journey. This is a book to savor.
2,"Good, until they get brittle..","If you don't mind buying two a season this baffle works great. Deters the majority of squirrels but I did have two large squirrels that were big enough to pull the baffle down and reach the top lip to pull themselves up.They get brittle quickly in the sun and require dismantling the entire feeder assembly to slide on the collar and the baffle. Squirrels will realize that they can break brittle baffles by slamming them into the metal pole. Over a year the center collar was quite chewed up, if I had decided to keep this system I would have needed to replace the collar by next year.I've moved to an all metal baffle system (Stokes Select 38046) and while I have no doubt that the squirrels will figure a way around it, I won't have to worry about them getting around the system by destroying the product."
5,Great and inexpensive way to keep squirrels away!,"Great product and a great deal on Amazon. Tried lots of other things to keep squirrels out of the feeder (home made baffles, grease on feeder pole etc.), but nothing worked. Put this up yesterday and had a lot of fun this morning watching the squirrels try to get past the baffle. Maybe they'll find a way around, but I doubt it!"
1,Carnival of Souls rip-off CD,"This CD, supposedly Gene Moore's score from the classic film soundtrack, is actually nothing more than a cheaply produced recording of the mixed film soundtrack, with dialogue, footsteps, noises, etc. along with the music. If you think - as I did - that you'll be able to hear the admirable organ score better on this CD than you can with your own videotape - think again. This is a completely worthless CD, as you can easily make a cassette or CDR recording off your VCR that will be EXACTLY the same, except for some irrelevant organ hymn music that was never in the film in the first place."
1,CIO Wisdom II,"This book is a complete fraud. It claims to have been written by CIOs and describe real life experiences but only 2 of the many authors have CIO titles or CIO experience, so how can this be?Most of book itself is pretty boring so it is best avoided.I think this is an attempt to cash in on the CIO Wisdom book which was written by actual CIOs and was interesting.Reviewed by a CIO"
5,A Realistic View of the Music Industry,"This book focuses on what happened inside the Experience, musically and financially in a way that a non-member of the group could not know. Noel is at times obsessed with past injustices, but to not present it all in this manner would make it seem like ""whining"". There is good advice to musicians, even today, of things to be careful of: drugs, contracts, agents, etc. I bought this at the same time as Mitch Mitchell's book. Mitch's book had better pictures, and certainly gave a glimpse of the time with Jimi after Noel left, but I liked this one just as well. I wish Noel the best, and now I'm going to order a CD or two, and hope he sees some royalty from that!!!"
3,Noels accounting obsession!,"An interesting book for those who want to know more about the Rock 'n Roll lifestyle of the 1960's. Or for those who remember Jimi Hendrix and his experience. However, Noel did get into way too much detail (which was hard to follow) on the legal & financial details - yes I know he was bitter about the lack of money getting to him & Mitch Mitchell but it makes about 25% of the book turgid and boring. Still worth reading though."
1,Crap crap crap,"Crrrrrrrrap! This ISN'T the same game, and there's no mention of this on the box! It's Rainbow 6 with anorexia: no changing characters; only one unit to command; no attack planner; half as many weapons and equipment! Ubisoft owes us a refund."
2,Starforce killed it and my PC,"No matter how fun a game is, Starforce CD protection kills it... and your PC too.Search boycott starforce and you'll see. Horrible.I'll now carefully avoid all Starforce games. They can kill your DVD-RW drive rendering it useless. Copy protection only hurts the legitimate user. Pirates are gonna copy it anyways. Whats the point of destroying my PC....Don't buy this game or any game with Starforce protection in it."
3,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Lockdown,"great graphics, multi player is not very challenging and the bad guys bodies disappear after you shoot them. Did you kill them or did they run away ?? you don't know because the bodies disappear. There is really no way to make the game more challenging like in rainbow six. You cannot lay down to take a shot or sneak up on the bad guys. The weapons are limited (only one sniper rifle). Take the original rainbow six game and apply these graphics and you would have a great game !!! As it is I give lockdown only 3 stars. It is a disappointment....."
2,NOT Rainbow Six,"DO NOT BUY.I don't know what this game is, but it is NOT Rainbow Six. The whole reason to play Rainbow Six games was for slow, tactical, and squad based game play. Lockdown has NONE of these features.No longer can you plan out your missions on a map. This lack of planning leaves you wandering around or traped in a linear map without options of attack. You only have one squad, instead of the usual 3. The sound was just... aweful; All of the weapons sounded like cap guns. If you want to be quiet and tactical, forget it... This game is made for running and gunning. I could go on and on about this crappy, crappy game, but I don't want to waste anymore time on it.The only reason I give a 2 overall is for the graphics. Those were nice, but good visuals don't make a good game.Skip this one, and hope that this company gets it right next time around. Or better yet, sells the Rainbow Six name to a company with a desire to keep the realism."
1,What happen to Redstorm Entertainment?,"I dont even own this game, but I have seen demos and videos of this game. I have the original RainbowSix game and RogueSpear, with the Urban Operations mission pack,and I also own RS:Covert Ops essential, I also have RS:Blackthorn and both RS:Ravenshield and Athena sword. But this one here looks crazy. Did RedStorm Entertainment hand over copyrights to UBI Soft or something? I'm very shock and disappointed, I notice the New Ghost Recon game has also falling in the same death trap in someways. Is this the way RainbowSix games are going to be like from here on out... I hope not...If so, I will quit here, on buying RainbowSix games. All I know is that RedStorm did a great job with the original RainbowSix games and I will also be a fan of the original ones and RedStorm too."
3,"Fun, Shallow, Repetive, Detailed!","The Rainbow 6 series goes pop in this arcade homage to the counter terrorism simulations they have been delivering. Loosing some of the realism (planning in particular) I feel that this does offer some fun that the previous games sometimes lacked. Yes the a.i. is not competent, especially for a Rainbow 6 game, but there are enough missions of varied, detailed length that will still have you on edge with the extremely limited health range and the chance of sudden death (one of the few traits they decided to leave in). Using the Rainbow 6 code and applying it to a more arcade type game might dissapoint fans of the series, but will hopefully gain many fans who simply couldn't deal with the overtly sim nature of the previous incarnations.."
2,Rainbow what?,"Right, so I read some other reviews on this page, and I said to myself (I have ghost recon and vegas) ""Hey, where's the good AI? Where's the tactical planning?""This R6 is more of a gunning game, where you just run through a linear map shooting people. But, some un-realistic stuff ruin this- (there are still some good gunning games out there)1. AI. Enemy AI just stands there. Your teamates blame you for shooting them while they get in front of you in the first place. Breach and clear? Call it Breach and stand there and throw and clear. Teamates open the door all the way (yes, they don't open it a bit and then use that small opening to throw a grenade!) and take about 3 seconds to throw a grenade, which usually ends up with a incapacitated teammate full of grenade sharpenel.2. GAMEPLAY. All the missions are like this- go in to rescue hostages. Kill bad guys. Rescue hostages. Go to extraction point.3.nothingthank you for reading this poor review."
4,An Excellent Resource...,"This small-format book is an excellent resource for anyone in the real estate industry. MLOs, real estate agents, settlement attorneys and assistants, title company people.........all will eventually refer to this book."
3,Nice watch but loses time,I have had my watch over a year now and I like it but it has a problem. Replaced original band with a nice leather band that fits my large wrist better. Problem: Watch randomly loses time. Sometimes only a minute or two and other times 10 to 20 minutes. Sometimes weeks go by with perfect time. Can't seem to find a pattern and I have changed the battery twice with no change. Still wear it but don't think I would buy another.
1,Unhappy with seller,I purchased this ame watch 25 years ago and it had a long life and I was happy with it. I received this new watch and it was defective. The bezel was loose. I sent it back and requested a new one because I really like this watch. So instead of sending me a new watch they just refunded my money without informing me until I asked what happened. I am dissapointed with their customer service.
4,"Good, But No Masterpiece","The way the name of the group is written and then the liner note pictures of Jonatha Brooke stumbling around looking out of place really makes you wonder whatever happened to Jennifer Campbell, ex-member of The Story who appears on Plumb only as one of the thankees in the liner notes. The Story's previous recording, The Angel in the House, was a masterpiece. Plumb is pretty good, but no masterpiece. Jonatha Brooke tries overdubs and an occasional backup singer in a vain attempt to bring back the magic interplay of voices that made The Story so special, but she can't quite bring it off. Canadian Bruce Cockburn is brought in to ruin one song, but that song deserves to be ruined, so no big loss, not nearly the equal of the loss of Jennifer Campbell. Still, this an excellent CD worth recommending, but The Angel in the House represents The Story in their true glory, so buy that first."
1,"Nice design, serious battery problems","After a few months of use this phone does not hold any charge at all. What does that mean, as long as it's not docked you wont be able to take any calls...I am looking at another phone right now. Very disappointed..."
4,WOW!,"Austin Powers has such a great movie,but the movie i haven't seen.My favorite songs are ""Work It Out"",""Miss You"",""Boys"",""Groove Me"",""Mind Goldmember"",and ""Daddy Wasn't There"".If i seen this movie yet,go buy it now!Rating:4.15 starsAlbert"
4,"Great single, BUT PLEASE DON'T BUY IT","Sure, I love the Foos as much as anyone, but for pete's sake don't buy this unless you are a SERIOUS collector, if you are, more power to you!The Song List: 1. Stacked Actors 2. Ain't It The Life (Live & Acoustic from 2metre Sessions) 3. Floaty (Live & Acoustic from 2metre Sessions)If you want to buy this for the live songs, DON'T BECAUSE THE SAME VERSIONS ARE ON THE GENERATOR SINGLE!!! So in essence, if you buy the Generator single, you'll get the same extra songs! Plus Generator has ""Fraternity"" which is the greatest song in the world and ""Breakout (LIVE)"" That's on the Generator single.DON'T BUY THIS UNLESS YOU ARE A SERIOUS FOO FAN (which I am, cuz I bought this)"
2,Size is different,Ordered 2 for my sister and wife. Sizes are 1 full size smaller than US standard. Has to exchange the item. Be careful...Thanks/.
3,Did the job but crimping tool poor quality,You get what you pay for. They could have made it at least a bit better. But I was able to somehow use it to connect my car stereo wires to the car's wiring hareness.
2,strippers are bad,"buy this item for all the connections, do not buy for the strippers. they are just horrible. they take a lot of force to open and dont cut wires too well. also there aren't enough compartments in the box to fit all the connections separately wish is weird haha. find0 different strippers!"
2,Not good,Quality is not good. Better to spend more and take branded equipment. The item delivered to me was rusted so i returned it.
3,Darknesses,"Book was like new, arrived in the timeframe specified. Spine had no creases and although it had a library marking, one must assume the retailer is helping them market excess copies of donated paperbacks."
1,Extremely Slow!,"This movie was terribly slow. There was an attempt at humor. An attempt, which seemed to work in the first 10 minutes, however, after 10 minutes of Damon saying quirky little things, one wants the plot to move along. I felt that this movie could have been good if they had tried to focus more on the twisted and warped mind of the lead character rather than trying to make Damon a comic. This movie fell very flat. By the end, I just wanted the movie to end and to have some resolution - it didn't matter what that was. I just wanted the movie to end! It was almost like they were trying to make a movie like Fargo, but didn't even come close. Do yourself a favor and save the two hours of your life that you can never get back!"
3,Could have been done better,"This is a great story that needs to be told, but the directing and casting were lacking. They really make Decatur out to be a little hicksville. While in the middle of the cornbelt, it is only a few hours from Chicago."
1,sorry there were no Amazon reviews yet when I pre-bought this,"This was one of the worse movies I have ever seen. A movie can be so bad, it can become wonderful. But this movie is just the worse waste of my time. So bad, I took the time to warn buyers not to waste their time nor money. Hoping it will make me feel better to express my total disappointment. Too bad there were no reviews yet on Amazon when I pre-bought this movie; I would not have bought it as I am clearly not the only one being angry believing a MattDamon movie gotta be good."
4,Matt Damon is really an actor!,"An amusing, understated movie. Matt Damon is completely believable as a self-deluded schlub. He really is an actor, I didn't know that before."
5,A chorus of praise!!,"Let me add my voice:Earthsongs is a wonderful CD!!!!!Secret Garden has many wonderful CDs you should try. This is the 2nd best.The best is Dreamcatcher which is an amazing CD. You must buy it!!!The third best is Once in a Red Moon. Not as well known but another great CD by Secret Garden!!!Of course you should listen to Enya, Lunasa, and Loreena Mckennitt!"
4,Earthsongs...,"""White Stones"" is still my favorite album by these folks but this one definitely has some worthy offerings. I love ""Reel"" and ""Daughters of Erin"" is beautiful also...a couple of the other vocal offerings are, in my opinion, fairly schmaltzy but wouldn't make me not enjoy the rest of this CD. The last cut on the CD, ""Raise Your Voices"" literally made me stop in my tracks when I had it playing for the first time and when it ended I backed it up and got out the insert to see what the lyrics were...it is truly beautiful and one I will play again and again. I ended up ordering the Norwegian version so I will be able to have the additional tracks that were cut from the US version. My advice would be to start with ""White Stone"" or ""Dreamcatcher"" both of which are really wonderful...but with the exception of a couple of the songs on this one I still think this is a pretty good CD."
5,Excellent product,This is an old tool needed for any one interested in the night sky. Most courses come with a version for those who live further south than Maine. Nothing special but definitly needed.
5,Marvelous Anthology!,"For a Daughter was my favorite even though it does not end on a total bright note. The Ivory Comb was funny! In the Lost Lands is a werewolf story of a sort. I enjoyed Lee's work as always. You will find some authors you will recognize from S&S; and the Chicks series. You may find some characters you recognize from other anthologies.For a Daughter, Jessica SalmonsonThe Battle of Crow's Daughter, Gillian FitzgeraldSouthern Lights, Tanith LeeZroya's Trizub, Gordon DerevanchukThe Robber Girl, Phyliss KarrLady of the Forest End, Gael BaudinoThe Ivory Comb, Eleanor ArnsonThe Borders of Sabazel, Lillian CarlWho Courts a Reluctant Maden, Ardath MayharThe Soul Slayer, Lee KilloughNightwork, Jo ClaytonIn The Lost Lands, George MartinIf you liked Marion Zimmer Bradley's Sword & Sorceress series, you'll enjoy this book too. Great book about strong women and what they do."
3,Shaft Influence - Yellow Eyes AWESOME!,"""Released"", is my least favorite Jade recording on Vertigo. I believe it was their second record. The song arrangements have an almost a feel like the music in the movie, ""Shaft"". This kind of undercurrents running through Rock music was very prevalent at the time (1972 - 3). There was some pressure to increase record sales on this release.The most note-worthy track is the song, ""Yellow Eyes"". It is a Musical & lyrical masterpiece in its own way. The song's simplicity, mood & eloquence are just beautiful!There are a few other gems Released0+too. But in my mind, this is the weakest of the Vertigo releases."
5,Our little princess loved it!,I bought this for my little niece for Christmas and she was thrilled! She went around the room and gave everyone a cup of tea immediately upon opening it. She played with it for nearly an hour and put it away carefully for use the next day. It is a lovely porcelain set and the quality is good.
5,Fantastic Collection of Favorites!!!,"The Mantovanti Orchestra shows off their ""marvelous versatility"" in this ""wonderful"" collection of ""8 CDs"", with titles that tell you ""just what to expect"", such as: ""The Love Songs"", ""Memorable Classics"", ""Itallian Favorites"", ""On Broadway"", etc. You can set the MOOD for practically ANY occassion! There are even some ""popular"" selections that we all know and treasure like: ""Moon River"", ""Over the Rainbow"" and ""Autum Leaves""!You will NOT want to remove these GREAT CDs from your CD Player, once you have listened to them! They make ""nice"" background music for small get-togethers or ""lovely"" background music for those ""ROMANTIC DINNERS"", for you and your ""SPECIAL SOMEONE""!!! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SET!!! It is a GREAT DEAL for the money, even at the full price!!!"
5,Just An Absolute SMOKIN' CD,Why this guy is not an international metal superstar is beyond me....this is the latest in a long line of releases by Jorn Lande....without a doubt one the premier song writer lead vocalists of today....even though this genre is a bit dated....he has a way of making it sound fresh....great songs...great hooks...great musicians and great production make it all work....check out this one or any of his previous cd's...you will not be disappointed.....just smokin guitar rock....
5,Must read for any Bronte fan,"As some people would say, once you read ""Jane Eyre"" and ""Wuthering Heights"" then you'll definite end up with Anne Bronte ""Tenant of Wildfell Hall."" The heroine is Helen. She could've turn out to be another Jane Eyre if she didn't have a son or an alcoholic husband. Like Jane, she stands by her moral convictions, and takes drastic action if necessary to achieve or maintain them. All in all, the book is terrific which all the characters got what they just deserve where every books should be."
5,A Box Set that is a Treasure from start to finish,"the Crusaders have always been One of My All-Time Favorite Musical Acts Ever.there Fusion of Music has no limits.here you get a tight cover of the Beatles ""Eleanor Rigby""(Which Happens to Be my Favorite Beatles Song they Ever did)""Sweet&N Sour"",is the Jam dig that whole Built Up&Vamp.the way the horns kick In&Groove.Stewart Levine&The Crusaders Strike a Great Balance on all fronts.the Arrangements just got stronger&full of more Fusion&Risk with each passing Album&they always seem to explore another Musical Direction&Make it work.I Listen to this Box Set at least Once a Month.The Crusaders are one of the Greatest Musical Bands in any Style or Era for me."
2,"Charging ""Stand"" still needs power source","This ""Charging Stand"" requires a charger. Considering the price, it should come with one. I purchased this for use at the office, thinking I could then leave the charger that came with the phone at home. No such luck. Be prepared to spend another $30 for the charging unit if you are purchasing this as a replacement or additional unit."
1,Terrible Rhetoric,"One star is being way to generous to give this book. I don't know who this author is but he comes across as a homophobic, sexist, racist jerk. You would have had to screw up real, real bad (as the author says he did himself) to find this book useful. About 3/4 of the book is just quoting someone or something else and the rest goes like this. 1. Spend time with your son. 2. Be involved in his activities. 3. Be a friend. Wow, what a worthless piece of literature. I find the book 365 things to do with your child written by Gymboree to be about 1000% more useful than this book. I would like my time and money back reading this piece of garbage."
5,On another level,"I've started getting into trance music by listening to the likes of old Oakey (Cream) and Tiesto (ISOS3) and other stuff. Though i've only listened to this cd set twice, it is just at another level. There are some unbelieveable tracks that just amaze you. I love the layed back nature of this cd set and the fact that these tracks are not on every cd makes this set even more special. If you're a novice to this music you may not appreciate it as much as a more experienced listener, but only cause you may not have heard the traks before. Armin throws some cuts that will just leave you in awe. I definitely recommend this cd for anyone that enjoys softer layed back trance."
3,Solo Aluminum Attache,"I was disappointed in the quality, cheap hardware, and after only a month the lid doesn't fit right any more. Wouldn't buy it again."
3,Gotta hear Kari-Anne!!,"A live album actually recorded soon after the fall of the Iron Curtain in Russia. The production is great, with the concentration being focused on the band and not the crowd. The inclusion of ""Kari-Anne"" makes this album a necessity. ""Kari-Anne"" is one of the best unreleased songs by a well-known group in recent memory. It's sound is pure Asia at its finest...driving rock filled with melody and counter-melody. ""Kari-Anne"" may actually define Asia at its best when it comes to what is sometimes known as ""prog light"" (accessible progressive rock). The inclusion of ""Starless"" and ""Book of Saturday"" from Wetton's earlier bands completes the circle of his goal in making Asia a progressive band with four minute songs instead of 15-minute songs. It's amazing at how much more listenable ""Starless"" becomes as a three-minute ballad than in it's original form."
2,Grade D+,"I have always been an Asia fan, more so then, than now. When i first bought this cd, when it first came out, I bought the video too, of the concert. I got home put it in, listened to it, put it up (both of them), and listened too it maybe once evey teo years since then. I sold the video a few years back, but held onto the cd, to keep my collection. I listened too again a few days ago, and I no longer think it's the worst live cd, I have ever listened too, it's got a little better, or I gotten hard of hearing. Palmer is still a bad drummer (on this cd), Wetton is still singing off key and having trouble with the high notes, and Pat, who replaced axeman Howe, is not Howe. Not as bad as it use to be, but still bad."
5,The Sallyangie by Mike and Sally Oldfield,I first heard this record when I was around 14 years old and really liked it. That was over 30 years ago and I no longer listen to music on a record player so was thrilled when I could buy it at amazon.com on CD.This CD quality is excellent and I love the very young Mike and Sally Oldfield performing some beautiful and lyrical music. The guitar and flutes and vocals are just beautiful.
5,I can listen to the whole cd,"I bought it just for Tumba La Casa, but I found out that I liked every single track. I put in on and can play the entire cd without having to skip any song. Great dance music, really gets your feet moving and your hips swinging. A must for any latin dance music fan."
5,really is the best of...,"love this cd, it has all the songs I remember as a kid. I have listened to this over and over since I got it. Her voice is so beautiful"
1,Do not buy this cd if you use IPOD,"This is a cd that will not play on a computer, so you will not be able to use the music on your IPOD. There is no warning on the Amazon site or on the cd packaging. There should be a warning letting you know before purchase that this CD cannot be used on a portable music device."
2,not really a dog toy,"our boston terrier puppy chewed off pieces pretty easily, we had to take it away because we don't want him to accidentally swallow anything"
1,Infuriating,I must say this is the most pretentious book I have ever had the displeasure of reading. Bergam has been high jacked.
4,A Very Nathaniel Hawthorne Book,"As this book followed Hawthorne's succesful ""The Scarlet Letter,"" there is no wonder that it carries the strong Hawthorne sentiments of mysteriousness and guilt. Although the whole book is ridden by an apparently dire mood, the gradual but sure development of the highly original plot makes the book an important addition to one's literary knowledge. Hawthorne himself appears to have summed up the story in his introduction, but the conclusion of the novel is not what one would expect."
3,HOUSE OF THE SEVEN GABLES,"I am in the process of reading this book. I got it on my Kindle and am not real pleased with my Kindle. Guess I am of the old school and prefer the actual book in my hands. Also, I do a lot of reading in bed and the Kindle does not work well for me there. Story is a classic and again it was something I wanted for my personal library. I have an old copy with very small print. At my age I need the larger print."
4,True depth of understanding required.,"If you want a fast paced action thriller, then rent a movie. This book has depth and meaning that only the ""true"" classics have. If you're into thinking for yourself and seeing a wonderful story unfold in your mind then this book is for you. And by the way, this can be understood by teenagers- I was 19 when I read it. I think the awful reviews are written by people with a lack of character, or perhaps maturity."
1,The plot is way too slow!,"I know Nathaniel Hawthorne is one of the classic American authors but this book was not very good. For the most part, he took way too long explaining things in great detail that really had little to do with the main story. I don't recommend it, especially if you're planning to write a paper on it because it's too slow-moving to get you excited and thinking about the underlying meaning."
4,Great Book about Motivation,"Old Story, Great Ending. Shows how if you are motivated enough, you can achieve anything. I would recommend to all young people."
3,Inspirational,A true classic motivational. Robin Sharma made an awesome recommendation. And the best was that it was available at no cost to the general public!
3,A Good Story,The book was interesting if a little out of date and I thought expensive for what it was. Good advice for a younger person just starting their working life.
2,Could be more motivating for a younger reader,"I'm 36 and bought this book as a Dave Ramsey recommendation. I thought it was a drawn out story, and wasn't all that inspired after reading it. I think a younger reader may be more motivated by the story because they haven't seen or read too many in their life and additionally would appreciate that the book is fairly short. I'm left scratching my head as to why the book is so popular."
5,awesome!,My 5 year old LOVES this and asks to watch all of the time! Very educational and informative. great buy!
5,Great for adults... not so much for younger children,"Thoroughly enjoyed this documentary as well as others in the series. The animation in these look so real you really feel like the animals are actually alive. I would caution that these programs are rather violent for young children. A good alternative would be the Prehistoric Planet set which is the same footage as Walking with Dinosuars, but reworked for children."
5,Dinosaur dvd,"excellent dvd! We had this in our collection years ago on vhs. It's so much better in digital format. This is one of the best productions BBC has ever done. The dinosaurs are realistic looking, the landscape is fantastic. Hours of entertainment. If you're a dinosaur fanatic this is a must have. You learn the life, eating habits, time periods, interaction of many different species of dinosaurs during the periods in which they lived."
2,This isn't good,"it gets dirty easily, and even if you wash it, it doesn't become clean.I don't recommend this shoes. It is durable and comfortable to wear, but I don't like the design and it stays dirty after washing it."
3,"Fun, but not very educational","Terry Deary takes a humorous look at Ancient Rome, and it is enjoyable, but I don't think it deserves the kudos that most people are giving it. The book really doesn't give children an accurate view of the Roman Empire. Too much space is devoted (in a very small book) to Britannia, and not enough to Rome itself. There's far too great a tendency to point out the ridiculous, and not enough nearly zero) to chronological facts. Hence, while intersting reading, I don't think young people will really learn much about Roman History from this book."
4,Good Item!!,"Bought it thinking that it would come with 2 rechargeable batteries but they werent include... But it works fine with the batteries that I already had...The Title of the listing still says ""Duracell Mini Charger; 2 Rechargeable Nimh Batteries"", With a picture of a retail pack with two batteries, you only know that you won't get the batteries when you get the item... it is misleading..."
4,Masterfully Written,"This book is beautiful. Its descriptions of the characters, the setting, and the times paints vivid pictures in the reader's mind. Although I could see where the writer was headed as the book came to a close, the ending was still a surprise. (I felt the ending was too abrupt, in addition to the content of the ending.)I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading fiction."
1,Waiting and waiting...,"After much anticipation I finally got ahold of this book and began reading. Shortly into the story I realized it wasn't worth waiting for. What a disappointment. The main characters did not garner my sympathy for their situation, only pity for their lack of action. I thought the story boring and couldn't wait to put it back on the shelf."
4,Fascinating but missing better hero,"This book was an easy read. It was a breeze to go through the pages because it was written well. I was fascinated and a little engrossed about the two women in this story, each representing two very different China. I was a little impatient with the male character, and ended up wishing that he had more backbone. I did not relate to him at all and felt trapped in the story because he was the hero.The plot itself is a little weak for my taste and the ending a little predictable. But overall, I appreciated the cultural detail and the beautiful way that it was written."
2,bored. bored. bored.,"Although there is some stunning prose in the book that is simple and profound in its wisdom, the language doesn't make up for unlikeable characters, slow moving plot and odd dialogue. The book reads as if it was translated which is wasn't. I enjoyed the glimse into the Chinese culture, but it was really hard to care about Manna or Lin, the main characters. By the end I didn't care what happened to either one of them. I enjoy reading books that are slower in pace (I loved Plainsong) but no book can get away with a thin plot and characters that are hard to root for. Waiting decades to get married only to be disatisfied with the marriage and want to end it. That's life I guess, but hardly the payoff the reader expects. We've struggled through all their tedious trials and tribulations only to have Lin realize he might have been better off with his now ex-wife. Hard to like the guy."
2,much ado about what!?,"After all the hype and hoopla surrounding this book -- I finally succumbed. I would have put it down immediately, if not for the the prize it had received. I kept hoping... well, entirely in vain, there was nothing there. It was a huge disappointment."
5,Lessons of Life,"I must give this book a 5 star rating because it shows one of life's greatest lessons. The grass IS always greener on the other side. How many of us are spending precious time looking for the happiness in life we already have but just don't appreciate? How many of us are as painfully honest with ourselves as Lin finally was with himself? Better late than never, I suppose. It's a good book, with a good lesson to learn."
3,ALMOST GREAT - BUT...,"I found this novel extremely easy to fall into. The storyline was intriguing describing as it does Chinese societal mores through the personal struggles of one man.However, I found the conclusion to be extremely disappointing and not up to the high standards of the rest of the book. It is a 308-page book that flows nicely until about the last 50 pages where it seems to rush to a very unsatisfying conclusion.While quickly getting Lin to some personal understanding, the author simply concludes the story without ever showing us what his main character does with his new-found insight.I was all the more disappointed because this book is, for the most part, extremely well-written and appropriately paced. Though I hesitated doing so because of the uninspired conclusion, it is for the writing style that I gave it three stars."
2,Waiting,"Perhaps I missed something, but this was a truly boring book. I found myself waiting for something to happen which never did. Man marries. Man moves. Man finds new love. Man tries to get rid of Wife year after year after year after year only to succeed and then to find there is no place like home. Well written? Yes, but so what?"
1,overrated,"What's unforgivable in Ha Jin's novel is not its historical inaccuracies obviously catered to the tastes and beliefs of a foreign audience. What's truly unfortunate is its depiction of Chinese people and society as being without some understandable passion or recognizable human emotion. Who are these aliens depicted in this novel? Real humans don't act like this. People in China during the cultural revolution certainly could not have acted like this. While reading this novel, all I could think about is how incredibly cold and uninteresting the characters are. Where is the pain and the suffering these characters supposedly endured during the cultural revolution? Yes they are Chinese, and yes they are therefore subdued, but that does not excuse the characters from their competely lack of inner struggle and psychological depth. Why should I care whether the divorce comes through or not? It's hard to give a damn when the characters don't seem to give a damn themselves."
4,Deceptively well written,"This book is not written with the outlandish style and genius of many contemporary writers. It's extraordinarily simple, both in its prose and in the story it tells. But something about it drew me in and kept me reading - maybe it was the sense that I was observing something about Chinese society that I'd never seen before, maybe it was the story itself. But I couldn't help but keep reading and was glad I did. This story captures the complexity of human relationships with a sort of Zen simplicity that takes deceptive skill - skill that is all too easy to miss perhaps.This is a very well written book. A very well thought out examination of human emotions. I recommend it highly."
3,Underwhelming,"Waiting is an easy read.Although I enjoyed the perspective and descriptive prose of a native of communist China, the story line was not challenging enough for me. The story seemed to become choppy and fall apart towards the end.The explanation of Manna's change in behavior towards the end was thin, too. I kept expecting for her to be disgnosed with a nervous disorder."
3,Waiting....,"A rather complex read, in that the language is often beautful, but the characters are difficult to care about. By the end of the novel, one hardly cares what the resolution is. One just hopes the waiting is over. On the other hand, our book club had to 'dig deep' in discussing this book, which many members disliked initially, and found interesting cross cultural and historical aspects of the novel to sustain our conversation. \"
3,"Hopeful, but still lacking","Review from a 28 year old Asian female:As a Chinese American, it is always nice to read a book written by an Asian author. What's nicer is that this book is not the usual tale about an Asian individual going to America trying to cope with cultural differences! What a relief!This book was beautifully written with a hopeful storyline, but it failed to culminate in a satisfying conclusion. I waited and waited for something that never happened. I felt betrayed, as if the author was leading me on. Overall, it was an average read. Not especially intriguing, but I was able to get through it without too much effort."
3,Tepid.,"This is not a book that evokes strong emotions. I found it mildly moving, mildly humorous, mildly involving. The reviews I read in the New York Times Book Review and other places lead me to expect something more. It wasn't a chore to finish it but I was left vaguely unsatisfied- like after finishing a light snack when you are hungry for a meal."
3,Empty Story,"I admired the Professor's ability to write in English, whose first language is Chinese. I know how hard it's. But the book just described a plain story, too be honest, just by using plain words, nothing exciting to read, nothing to think about after finishes."
3,Very depressing,"Although I liked certain aspects of this book and the somewhat spare style with which it was written, I found it terribly depressing. The whole part about not being able to divorce year after slogging year was a bit too much for me."
4,Couldn't keep from putting it down...,"I'd read a bit of this book, get bored, put it down, pick itup. It's taken me nearly six months to get through. Ithas its lovely points- and the historical context is fascinatingto one who has no reference points with modern China.I learned from it. As beautiful as the imagery and thelanguage sometimes is, it is also, on some levels, acolossal bore. It reminds me of the beautiful film, ""TheScent of Green Papaya."" Nothing much happens, but atthe end you do feel you've watched a magical vision unfold."
4,Welcome to China,"Ha Jin's novel, ""Waiting"", resembles a more contemporary version of Pearl Buck's ""The Good Earth."" Like Wang Lung, Lin Kong never seems to be at peace. The love he wants is always beyond his grasp. Lin waits 18 years for his wife to consent to divorce before he can finally marry his love, Manna. But the ideal Lin has carried with him for 18 years is not what life presents. Often times I wanted to scream at Lin and Manna, but other times I could feel their frustration and wanted to reach out and comfort them.All in all, I enjoyed ""Waiting."" It was a moving and sometimes comical tale full of recent Chinese history and great character development."
4,Food for Thought,"I read this book in three days and enjoyed it very much. The story of Lin and Manna gives you something to think about. The moral of the story is be careful what you wish for as it may eventually come true. Lin and Manna were so obsessed with the idea of getting married and being together that they never considered if they truly loved one another. It was intresting to read about the culture differences and customs people of their country had to face. I agree with some of the reviewers that the ending was not in keeping with the rest of the book and seemed rushed. The book was not fast paced, but then it wasn't meant to be. I would recommend this book as it is well written, keeps your interest, and is a good read."
1,disappointing and amateurish,"I can't believe that this book actually won an award. Obviously, the reviewers have no recognition for good literature or it was politically biased. I wish I hadn't wasted my money. House of Sand and Fog, which was up for the same award, should have gotten it. Some one once said, ""there are no good books, there are no bad books,"" except ""Waiting."""
1,For diehards only.,"Let me start by putting out a couple of my biases before getting into this review-- first, I relaly don't care for remixes as a rule, unless they're dramatic and severely restructure a song, I generally find they add little. Second, I really don't care for ""The Hand That Feeds"".Having said that, the piece is presented in three mixes, the album version, the Straight mix, and the Dub mix. The album version has a catchy, circular guitar line and a straightahead drum beat that's actually decent until the bridge with this bizarrely irritating spoken wordish section. Just doesn't work.The remix fares no better-- the Straight mix adds different rock beats and an extended introduction that eventually becomes tedious.If you're a fan, get it. If not, skip this one, there's good reasons it wasn't released in the U.S."
3,Okay book,"I just could not get into this book. I am not exactly sure why, but I think I just could not identify with the author."
1,A Big Disappointment,"I had a lot of hopes for this book from the title and the customer reviews.It started well enough with an account of the accident that led to his epic run.However,the book for the most part reads like a travelogue of the Grand Canyon and a history of the land,explorers,settlers and Indians that went through there decades and centuries before. I don't really care about all the historical detail. Frankly, it got to be very boring. Boring to the point I couldn't finish it. As a lifelong runner I'm always on the search for great running books,this definitely is one to avoid."
5,A Modern DeTocqueville,"This is a GREAT book. With an occasionally scathing and frequently witty style, Laxer uses a variety of personal experiences garnered while travelling in the US to paint a fascinating and disturbing portrait of American society. The first third of the book is particularly effective as the multiple elements of violence in the U.S. are exposed. This book is like a mirror held in front of one's face; it forces Americans to confront some uncomfortable truths about our national character. With nationalistic fervor high from the Sept. 11 attacks, this may not be a popular read at the moment, but I think Laxer offers an intriguing and sobering view of the U.S. that merits our attention."
2,"no docs, item delivered different than pictured","The charger I got from Amazon.com came without a single word of documentation. The manual for my phone helps a little. The charger comes with snap-in templates to fit different phones (I guess), but not a word of explanation about which one to use, or what the others might be for. Maddening. I just played Garanimals(tm) until I had a good fit, but why was that up to me to figure out? At these prices, write some instructions!The item that I received is different from both the one in the manual and the one pictured on Amazon.com even as I write this review, so any docs about what the lights mean would be useless anyway.Kudos to the guy who figured out that there's a status light for data sync activity -- go to the head of the class! :-)Oh, the charger seems to work fine. The ""drop in"" slot for the phone is more like ""pin the tail on the donkey"", though, same as with my Nextel phone. All in all, I'd expected a better consumer experience from Motorola."
2,unhappy,"I bought the charger, along with 2 spare batteries. The charger is simple, and easy to understand, good since there was no instruction sheet. It can be used in a car with the standard charge cord. However it will not fit anything larger than the 900ma battery that comes with the startac phone. Not nearly what I expected."
1,PLAY LIST INCORRECT,"have brought two copies of this cd based on the play list advertised on the amazon web site but when i got them,the cd was not a double disc,nor did it have the songs as listed...dang!"
5,"Inspirational and relaxing, yet thought provoking.","The music is truly well written. The CD has a great variety of music and sounds. ""Boundless"" is thought provoking. ""Mariana Trench"" takes the listener on a journey to the deepest part of the ocean. You can easily let your imagination run as the music guides you through the ocean depths. ""Heather"" is one of the more relaxing songs. It is mellow and calms the spirit."
5,Awesome Product - Awesome Idea !!!,"Got this for our two cats and was not really sure they would like it. WOW, they love it. They spend hours on end sitting and watching the sights and sounds of outdoors all in a very safe environment. Installation was easy and does not necessarily require permanent installation.I highly recommend this product. I always felt it was sad to see my kitty not see the outdoors enough. But with this product, I am very happy to see him get some ""outdoor"" time."
4,Too Many Best Of's,"The Who have put out way too many anthologies but this is the one I had as a teenager and it worked for me. Nice selection that includes two of their most overlooked gems: Slip Kid and Relay. Pick this up used, well worth it.Meaty Beaty Big and Bouncy is also the classic and crucial collection of the pre-anthem era '60's singles."
4,Good,"I like it, sets my face and absorbs oil! For this price ! Love it, the smells is not bad! I actually like it, it completes my mornings"
1,blu-ray quality is awful,"this movies transfer is just plain awful,,,,,very grainy,, a vhs tape would look better,,,ripped off is what i'm feeling watching this,,,,save your $$$$$"
2,Slow and ineffectual,"This might be one of the slowest moving movies I've ever seen. The plot really only takes place in about the last 30-45min. Then when it does, it doesn't go very far. I'm really surprised at the number of good reviews of it. I gave it 2 stars since there were a couple action shots that were decent and it did have a halfway decent ending. Although, that could have been my joy it was over."
3,Back to the 80's!,I thought this film was worth watching simply because it brings back that 80's horror genre feel. It is slow. I however enjoyed the story and acting was decent. Worth renting for sure :)
3,good but dragged,"i saw my share of horror movies but never seen one where the film focuses too much of a young college student babysitting and just sitting around the house. The film did somewhat drag..about a 90 minute movie and most of the portrays a women walking around some strangers house..I started losing patience toward the mid range of the movie....overall, its a good film and some parts did keep me in the edge of my seat..."
3,House of the Devil,"House of the Devil looks like a film from the 80's, as it promises. The only problem is the movie is very slow paced and boring with little things happening from time to time but nothing could hold my interest. The ending was more of today's horror rather then 80's. I dont know who thought of that stupid trick of flashing images rapidly before a viewers eyes but I hate it and it needs to stop. Overall, i'd recommend watching the film at least once to see the fuss is all about. Everyone has an opinion and mine was, it did look like something from the 80's but was very slow paced."
1,Don't see why this deserves any praise,"I'm surprised by all the gushing reviews for this movie. I am watching it right now, having rented it from IO for a whopping $6.45. Wooden acting, stiff dialogue, clear absences of a competent editor, and meaningless scenes create a boring movie. It seems that the creators of this movie fancy themselves as independent film types. Nothing could be further from the truth. I already mentioned that the script was stiffly written. ""Ah, I see you've met. Excellent."" The lack of editing creates a slow pace that drags on and on. The star, who resembles Karen Allen, is lovely to watch but not exactly inspired, or a good actress.Do yourself a favor- wait for it on HBO, but don't pay to see this movie."
2,House of Please Something Happen,"Everyone said this movie was a throwback to the horror films of the 80's, but nothing ever seems to happen in this very slow movie. The mood was great, but I need some pay-off."
3,Gloomy,"This is a very well made chain and it is well weighted. However, it has no shine to it whatsoever!! It looks very grey like gloomy storm clouds. It doesn't even look like white gold it is so dull. Looks more like stainless steel in overall appearance/color. I sent mine back!"
5,Puttin it through the groove filter!,"Damn, it's good to see bands not afraid to show their influences. You'll swear you heard moves from 'On the Corner,' 'Thrust,' the Fellers' 'Hurricane,' and straight-up roller rink disco. Regardless, much distance is traveled---the requisite these days--album as soundscape, possessing all spectral components of the cliche but unavoidable 'vibe.'"
5,We love the style and the feel,"We had just remodeled our kitchen in a contempory style. When I saw this set I just had to have it even though I could not find any reviews of the quality. Well, after two years I can relate the knives are easy to handle and keep their edge well. It includes a knife sharpener and steel that I use to keep them sharp. My only complaint is there were no instructions on how best to use the sharpener and steel. I have had to learn by trial and error."
5,"mash season 6, I love mash, I would recommend it to anyone who loves mash",I love mash. I would recommend it to anyone who loves mash. The Disks were very good. I have all of mash.
4,"Great book, but with a disclaimer","I really enjoyed doing this Bible study with my kids. However, I just want to warn the reader that if you're using this with a younger child, be aware that it does mention 'having s*x, and fornication. I wasn't prepared when it came up, and I'm glad my ( 8 year old) child wasn't reading it on his own. This may not be an issue for some, but it caught me off guard and I just wanted to give a heads up. Otherwise, we really got a lot out of this book!"
3,Sinatra Sings Mozart?,"Indeed he does (La ci darem la mano from Don Giovanni) with Kathryn Grayson, and quite gracefully too. This unique duet is worth the price of admission, but in addition you get loveable Jimmy Durante, an icon of vaudeville and early television (where ARE those shows?), and charming Peter Lawford, Kennedy in-law and Rat Packer-to-be! The plot is indeed forgettable, but the highlights make it worthwhile."
5,What a deal!,Great collection at a great price. Not necessarily the best movies ever made but a critical part of Sinatra history
3,"Nice, But Overpriced","Alfred Price is a leading author on the Allied bombing campaign over Germany in World War II. As such, it is always worth looking at any work on the subject that bears his name. However, I agree with an earlier reviewer that this book falls more in the category of ""well presented coffee table book"" than a must read for historical research. So for a reader with a more casual interest in the topic, I can recommend this book, however it is overpriced at its list price. Wait until it goes on the discount table then buy it at half price. It would be a good value then."
4,terrific! excellent reading!,"this book leaves you beleieving in the powers of the fearfamily, starting with nicholas fear and continuing withhis son robin fear. It is very realistic and although a littlegory at times it is not overdone"
4,good place to start,"This is an okay choice for simple home planning. The color selection is good as long as you accept that it won't be a Sherwin-Williams perfect match. The fabrics tend to stretch and look strange, but there are a fair amount to get by with, the wallpapers are okay, the curtains colors are really limited. It seems best for single to three room layouts, without mirrors, clocks or pictures which tend to float or attach to corners. Stairs are a pain as there seems no way to rotate them for your space. Save save save as you go, there are sudden glitches that freeze things up. I like it overall for fooling with or exploring what a space would look like from a blueprint. Haven't figures out the import feature yet either! For the price it is decent and does let you get a feel for the space."
1,Buy a case of Tylenol - you will need it!,"This is pretty ambitious software, and you will have fun - at first. Then you discover that if you make any tiny little error, such as two walls that are not quite connected, or a room that overlaps another room, or some error that you don't even know about, THE PROGRAM BLOWS UP. And your file, with hours of work, is toast. And THERE IS NO TECH SUPPORT (they claim they will return calls, but they don't).DON'T BUY THIS SOFTWARE UNLESS YOU ARE A GLUTTON FOR PUNISHMENT."
1,horrible software,"Have tried repeatedly to use this software to plan decor and future additions to my home. Very difficult to use! It actually erased the floor in one of the upstairs bedrooms with no apparent remedy, is extremely limited on how you are allowed to ""size"" furnishings, creating stairways is extremely difficult, the tutorial only covers a small amount of information, and there is no manual included with the software. I do not like using this at all!"
3,second generation,This is a collection of poems and stories written by children of holocaust survivors who grew up in Australia in the 1950s & 60s.
5,Blood stirring,"If you have one drop of Scots blood in your veins and you can listen to the first track on this CD where Steve recites ""Scots wha hae"" without getting gooseflesh, then you should get medical help, because you are near death! A beautiful CD from beginning to end, IMHO."
3,"good player but, customer service issues w/ Sony","I bought this player in April 2005. It stopped playing for no reason. Replaced battery and still no function. I emailed and phoned Sony Customer Support and they said they would either repair or send me a refurbished one.I opted to send the player in for repair. A tech called and said he would give me a discount on the repair(almost the cost of a new one) Long story short, they have had my player from July to September with no call, no email what so ever.In fact, I still do not have my player as I write this. I feel like I've thrown $150. away. As for the player itself, the software for me is great, easy to use, and the player up until it stopped working after 45 days, was great aw well. I agree the head phones aren't so good so I purchased new ones. So I thought this was a great player until it stopped."
1,Cable not compatible with many Swann cameras - horrible tech support.,The AC Adapter shipped with my Swann Super Night Owl security camera does not fit with this Swann siamese cable. I checked the Amazon reviews and another person had the same issue with the Swann 100ft Siamese cable and their Swann Maxi Day/Night Camera. Don't even bother trying to contact Swanns technical support - I gave up after a month of trying to get some help from them with no response. I ended up just buying a siamese cable from another manufacturer. You may save a few bucks buying a swann camera but it will cost you more in the long run with their disappointing technical support if you ever have an issue.
4,this cd rocks,discovered this singer on you tube for the title songs video..it blew me away. this cd is just fun easy to listen to and there are some really fun jams on here whether you speak the language or not youll get the message. its worth owning.
4,You need this!,"I got into the Dots after seeing a show of theirs last year, and this is a highly recommendable cd. The ninth track, Princess Coldheart, was mindblowing live and it's still got the same effect on the recording. #3, Hellsville, is another great song, an all around great album. If you're looking for something halfway between gothic and industrial, I'd say this is a sure bet. It's beyond classification, vaguely Floyd-esque, but so much beyond."
2,Wheres YOU'RE THE LOVE!,"My heading says it all. I heard this cd but any Seals And Croft CD is imcomplete without YOU""RE THE LOVE."
5,A GREAT BOOK,"This is by far one of the best books I have ever read and had. Machotka details Cezanne in a great way. I was never a great fan of Cezanne before purchasing this book, now I'm a devoted fan! Cezanne would be proud to have someone like Machotka writing about his work."
4,Good book,"I especially like the first half of this book. Love the review and definitions of the Al-anon slogans. I re-read that part often, just to keep them in my mind. Haven't finished all the personal stories yet. I recommend this book."
4,The king of insensitivity,"As the self-proclaimed king of insensitivity so bluntly states on his highly rated Atlanta-based radio show, ""Welcome to the House of the Painful Truth."" In this brief, yet concise, treatise, Boortz reveals how he really feels(as if he ever hides his disdain) about the liberals of America. Boortz lays out, interspersed with humor, a concise and structured argument debunking the emotion-based logic(or lack thereof) of the brainless liberal populace. Boortz tells how he made the transition from a delivery man doing heavy lifting to doing talk radio in Atlanta after a DJ killed himself and a position became conspicuously vacant. At the interview, Boortz, in his trademark sarcastic style, promised to give a 2 weeks notice before offing himself.Speaking of liberals, Boortz correctly states, ""They want limited government about as much as you and I would like to have a root canal."""
4,A great one sitting read!!,I bought the book thinking I was going to read it on and off. I picked it up and didn't put it down until I was done. Boortz is the king of insensitivity. Every college graduate should read this book to prepare themselves for the rest of their lives (if they have a desire to work in a job that actually has a future to it!!).
2,"What, again?","Largely a regurgitation of what was contained in [The Commencement Speech You Need To Hear]. Accurately challenges a person's thinking on subjects covered, with little new material included. If you bought the above, you probably would be disappointed with this purchase. If you didn't buy the other, don't. Buy this one instead, it is ""backward compatible."""
1,Sad,"It is very sad that some people can read this book and think, ""This man writes the truth."" I was in Paris and I was amazed to see a copy of this book being read by a French man. I asked him about it and he told me, ""This is the way Americans think. They are amusing idiots."" Not all Americans, thank God."
2,save your money.....tune in to your radio,"The book is a very good logical summary of Neal's political view (which I happen to agree with) however if you listen to Neal's talk show everyday, the book will be nothing but a replay. I feel Neal could have done more than replay his daily talk show. I was disappointed."
3,the right for dummies,"I'll keep it basic. The book is basic and up front. An informed reader doesn't learn from this book. They are only reminded of how much some people care about the left/right battle. Come up with some new material neel. he's not a writer, he's a talk show host. that being the case his book is half assed and he even admits his lack of writing skill and interest..on the other hand if you have minimal knowledge about the subject you will think he's the man."
1,Crenshaw lacks credibility,"Crenshaw was most certainly there in the ER during the futile attempt to save JFK, but he has said some things that he must have made up.For example, he claims to have seen a small ""entrance"" wound in JFK's throat. But he also claims to have gone into the ER with Dr. McClelland, and McClelland entered the ER *after* the throat wound had been obliterated by the tracheotomy.His claim to have gotten a call from LBJ during the attempt to save Oswald just doesn't work. LBJ was headed out to the ceremonies during which JFK's body was moved to the Capitol.Worst of all, in this book he claims that LBJ wanted a confession from Oswald. But in an earlier version of his story, LBJ demanded that Oswald be killed! It seems that people failed to believe this, and it was changed![...]"
3,Read Michael Baden's Book ...,"If you really want to know what happened read Michael Baden's book entitled ""Unnatrual Death: Confessions of a Medical Examiner"" Dr Baden, along with several other highly respected ME's, performed an ""autopsy"" on JFK based upon photographs, skull fragments, etc. The conclusion and reasoning behind the conclusion will have even the most ardent of conspiracy buffs convinced of just exactly how JFK was killed and by how many bullets and the location that the bullets came from."
1,mistitled,"I'm not sure who could benefit from readingthis book. It is in no way an accessibleintroduction to the subject in the title.For that, one would do far far better toconsult Apostol's book from his caltech course.Unfortunately the writing style here is socasual and devoid of examples as to offer nopossible traction for the mind."
3,"Food is fine, bad for tank water","The food is rapidly eaten by my Red Eared Sliders, however it sinks fast and quickly gets sucked into the filtering system where it tends to slowly destroy water quality unless I'm constantly cleaning out the filter media. It simply sinks way too fast and I'm probably not even going to finish this package due to the negative effects on the water quality."
4,The Loudest Scream,"This book was very interesting. It keeps you in suspense. I was so sad when it said ""To Be Continued..."" I can't wiat to read the last book. It really was a good book. It was a little violent, but still good."
1,Where is my item???,"I dont have time to do anything with this problem.I dont want this item any more, It was so late for my Art class and I want my money back."
2,"Great metal, poor wood.","The metal work and extruded upright are fantastic and well done, and easy to assemble. The mount between the stand and TV is great, easy to adjust and use, and could be reused as a wall mount if you get tired of the stand.The base is thinly finished MDF with a tubular metal frame underneath. The decorative black part of the base dents easily (don't drop a washer or bolt while assembling the unit as it will dent the surface) and the edges can be caught by a vacuum wrecking the sleek look of the unit, by pulling the finish off exposing the MDF underneath."
2,It's OK,"I originally bought this stand on Crutchfield approx 1 year ago for a 46 inch LCD. It worked OK, the wire management system is nothing to write home about. I found the tunnel bored thru the middle of the support shaft is too narrow, making the task of feeding cables nearly impossible, especially power cables (the male ends are too big for it).Well...I have graduated to more sophisticated furniture, and I thought I would use this stand for my 32 inch LCD that I use in my office. The stand is too big for it. The brackets that hold the TV to the stand cover the inputs for my audio inputs.It's a shame. Now I'm stuck with an ugly TV stand that won't work with my TV."
4,A garage tool user,"I bought this Belkin power strip to use in my garage for radio and various tools that have the little adapter power supplies, and other tools. This was a replacement for an older, 10 or years that I have been using. Oh yes, the power strip I am using in my den for computers, printers, and related is the same brand, but it has space for 4 large plug ins. This has space only for 3. the reason being that on the one just bought they have placed in the fourth position plugs for phone and network. I really liked the older, about 2 years model that has the phone plugs on the end edge, not in the position where a power plug should be."
4,Great outlet,I have the grey version and it seems to hide the dirt much better than the white.... So far so good. I like the option to close the outlet when not in use and the 3 well-spaced outlets for adapters. Good thinking on their part.
3,Ho-hum,"The surge protector is Ok. My complaint is that you have to be Superman to plug your device into the outlet. I am a big guy, but with this protector I feel like Olive Oyl."
4,Belkin lives up to expectations,"I have never gotten a bad product from Belkin, this as all others I have bought works as expected, It is well thought out and engineered. I hav'nt been hit by lightening yet, but if I do I know it will be there for me."
4,Excellent Book,"Interesting book that was very helpful. I would have liked if it was more detailed and longer, but that would be my personal preference, not something really wrong with the book."
4,Excellent book on PTSD,"This is an excellent overview of PTSD, including the things one needs to know about self-care and managing the disorder. It is an organic disturbance in the mind and the nervous system, and there are ways to live with it.As the suicide rate for returning veterans continues to climb (and to be unreported by media), PTSD is going to continue to be a public health issue, as will its treatment. This is a clearly-written guide, more for the client than the practicioner."
5,Great Music,"This an outstanding record by one of best of their time. Sweet Home Alabama is the top track but there are all right up there with that track. If you have never heard the whole album, you owe it to yourself to give it a listen. If it's been a long time since you have heard it, then you have forgotten how good it really is!"
5,Their best effort,"Second Helping is a wonderful record and will remain the staple of their existence down the road. Taking a page from the Allman Brothers, The Stones' Exile On Main Street, and the blues of Robert & Lonnie Johnson, Van Zandt & co. show an eclectic side to their sound, ranging from the folk-blues of Curtis Loew to the gritty Fogerty styled cuts Don't Ask & Sweet Home Alabama. Lynyrd Skynyrd absorbs their influences well instead of recycling them, and create a wonderful landmark album that anyone would enjoy. Second Helping and Pronounced are the only two you'll need if you're looking to start a collection."
3,"This is OK, a little old","This is OK, a little old. To tell the truth, the hooked on match multiplication is hard to find, and this was relatively affordable."
2,"Awful DVD, rough story","Interesting to have for Hitchcock fans, you get to see the master in his earlier days in a movie that still has some professional production values.One big problem, the quality of the dvd is so bad here, for much of the beginning of the dvd, one can barely hear what is being said, I mean it is BAD! Almost unwatchable, I do not recommend this dvd."
1,"Interesting, but ultimately unlistenable","I've listened to a lot of Coltrane's stuff, and I'd say this is one of the worst albums. Om is a good track, but Ascention is simply abyssmal. I read somewhere that the musicians were on acid when the recording was made and it shows. 40+ minutes of pure agony, twice. If you're looking for essential Coltrane, this is not the place to start. I put ""Crescent,"" ""A Love Supreme,"" and the ""The Complete 1961 Village Vanguard Recordings"" at the top of my list, and this one at the bottom. This album is purely for those interested in knowing what a great musician sounds like when he lets go completely."
5,A must reference for any ems worker,It may be a bit bulky to carry into the field. I am a volenteer SAR/EMT and can't see hiking into a difficult place with it. But it would be good to keep in the vehicle and to review from time to time.
3,Not as Good as I Remember,"I don't know why I used to think this was such a great show. I guess I liked the comradeship, but as a not quite twenty year old anymore, I find Ross's perpetual whining annoying, and Rachel is so self-absorbed most of the time it is also . . . annoying. Some good laughs overall, but not as good as other sitcoms."
4,"Ground breaking! Urban was 1st,none since did it as well!","Peter Urban has collected a small group of the types of ""stories"" which float & whisper through all martial arts training halls. Some seem fictional, yet are the truth. Others, seem like wild exageration, but were not. A good book for any martial artist regardless of their art or style. A good book for both children and adult Martial Artists alike; or simply those curious about them"
3,"Good writing, but....","First off, I should say that the writing is excellent. You won't have any problem following the story. As another reviewer stated, she does have a way with ""lush texture"". I have to disagree with the statement that the reader is anxious to learn the outcome. You can pretty much tell the outcome after the first couple of chapters. The best part of the book is the end in which the everything is finally revealed, but aside from the character, you should have pretty much figured everything out long before you get to this point. If you need a book that you don't want to get too involved in and don't want to spend more than a few hours on, this book is for you!"
5,AMAZING,"This is a riveting book that gets better in the second half. You follow the life of Josh in Tucson and experience his fraternity and work. In particular, the character Erik is incredibly interesting. I think that most people will fall in love with Erik and want to meet him personally. Don't be surprised if this book makes it into the movie theaters. Look for the role of Erik to be played by someone of the likes of Brad Pitt or Ben Afleck. Great Book. Even better character in Erik!!!"
4,Some of Shepp's Best,"""On This Night"" is an outstanding, if not altogether consistent, CD. It definitely contains some of Shepp's best playing, most notably the first five tracks featuring Bobby Hutcherson on vibes. The title track leads off the album in quite an eerie fashion courtesy of Christine Spencer's soprano vocals. The album's inconsistency comes from two places. First, there are three different drummers on the first five songs -- Rashied Ali plays on 1-3, J.C. Moses on 4, and Joe Chambers on 5. These drummers have very different approaches to experimental jazz, and it gives the session a haphazard rhythmic feel. The other problem with the CD is the trio session tacked on the end. While the music is very good, it really makes it feel like two wholly different albums. The trio recordings make up tracks 6-10 of the CD, but three of them are versions of ""The Chased."" Overall though, this is some of the best avant-garde jazz of the 60s. Not to be missed by any fan of the ""New Wave."""
3,a favorite for my puppy,"my puppy loves this toy, but that seems to be the case when dogs can easily gut them. My mistake for having a toy that has stuffing. But for the puppy, there is great joy and satisfaction in pulling the stuffing out. Now that the stuffing is gone, she still seems to like this toy. The ropes are solid and she likes to flop it around. Strictly for outdoors at my house though."
2,Destroyed in minutes,My little 10 pound dog completely destroyed this toy in just a few minutes. She had the squeeker out and then shredded the body. Only the ropes survived. Now we just have expensive rope toys left.
2,NO BETTER--NO WORSE,"THIS WAS MY SECOND """"ELVIS COLE""""---THIS TIME HE WIPES OUT THEWHOLE MAFIA---WITH HELP FROM PIKE, OF COURSE---AND ONLY GETS SHOTIN THE SHOULDER. STILL A POOR IMITATION OF """"ROBERT PARKER"""".AAA NNN DDD---THIS WHOLE THING OF LISTING EVERY STREET THEY GO DOWN---EVERYTURN THAT THEY HAVE TO TAKE---EVERY BRIDGE THEY HAVE TO CROSS---EVERY STOPLIGHT THEY RUN INTO---WOW!!!---TALK ABOUT ANNOYING!!"
4,Fast-paced fun!,"The comparisons to Spencer are obvious. Even the storyline here is familiar. But despite all that, the book is a fun, fast-paced, enjoyable crime novel. Cole is an easy-to-like wisecracking hero with a heart of gold. Pike is the cold, matter of fact, partner that you can always rely on. In this novel, Cole and Pike are hired by an egotistical and pompous movie director to locate his ex-wife and son. Finding her isn't much trouble, but then Cole decides to help her and learns that she is in a terrible predicament. Cole and Pike eventually run into the NY mob, and from there the story blisters towards a satisfying (and very violent) conclusion. I highly recommend this for fans of the hard-boiled PI genre."
1,"Noisy, bad quality product",It's too noisy to be in bedroom in the night. It's broken in less than half year usage.
2,avoid this humidifier,"Looks great on delivery: many light-up gizmos. The ""3-gallon"" water portion holds perhaps 2 gallons. Vapor is indeed released as steam--more vertically than horizontally. It is therefore more efficient as an inhaler than a humidifier.Nothing in Amazon's presentation indicated that filter pads were necessary. Thus what had seemed an advantage--the absence of replacement filers, e.g.--was undone when I operated this humidifier.With weekly cleaning--per instructions--mine died after less than 3 months. I have junked it.A great disappoointment. The previous Honeywell warm air humidifier was infinitely better designed and,with proper care, lasted two years.DO NOT BUY THIS ONE. IT IS DISCOUNTED FOR GOOD REASON."
1,Just stopped working,"Got the item, and it worked for about 3 days, then shut itself off. Won't even power on now. Seems to be a common defect."
5,This book is a must have!,"Even after spending about 50 years among the Choctaw, Byington still managed to miss some of the nuances of the language, including double consonants that are not always obvious. Nevertheless, this is a fantastic dictionary. I use mine all the time. You will not be able to gain fluency without learning from a native speaker, so it's a good thing the tribe currently offers free language lessons online!"
5,Wella Liquid hair Mousse,"this product has been discontinued, however this merchant had some bottles, my heart jumped beats since I found this wonderful product again. I have been on a search for months to find something simiar and cannot. I wish Wella would reconsider and start making this again, this entire line was great, however I guess not good enough in sales."
3,A nice remix album,"This album is worth picking up for the ""Der Verfluchte Angel"" remix of ""Modern Angel"" alone. I believe 99 Kowalski was the singer of the opera track which was used in the original song, but I may be wrong. There's a great little break in the song that has a NIN feel to it. The other tracks are marginal, and I would probably recommend the ""Mut@ge Mix@ge"" album over this one for remixes."
5,review,"i loved the music but would probably not buy from the artist again. it makes sense,hes pretty busy with the music."
1,Problem here,"I like the songs on these discs, but hate the cheap canned laughter that is dropped in on every track. It isn't live because the laughs all sound the same, have the same pitch and volume. And it gets in the way of the enjoyment of the song/comedy/routine. Some of the laughs are dropped in where there are no jokes. The hell with it."
4,Nice FuelBelt!,I decided to purchase this FuelBelt after reading the comments. I did read on one that you could fit an 8oz. bottle of water along with your phone etc. I have an iPhone 4S which fits perfectly with other small things (Carmex etc) but I was not able to fit a small water in along with my phone. I wish that it was a tiny bit bigger and the water would fit. There is a clip on the side to hook a water bottle to that sticks out but I do not plan on using that as I would think it would bounce around too much.. so I just tuck the clip in so it doesn't get in the way.. I am happy with the product overall and love the color.
3,Maybe was a mistake for me,"Product quality is good, just wish it I had read more critically others' reviews regarding what will fit. I read the dimensions but did not take into account that if you put in your iphone the height accomodation is not enough to put much else that is not flat or small. Not sure of durability since I have not used it much as it does not really fir my needs."
4,(3.5 stars) Sounds like it's from another world....,"Now this is an unexpected change of pace. It's calm. It's restrained. It's eerie. It's completely unlike most the rest of Coltrane's other works, since it's free jazz that defies the stereotypical loud honking and clattering. The tunes rise and fall like waves, or maybe the tide, with plenty of crescendo and decrescendo and not much by way of traditional structure. In terms of sheer mood this is hard to beat, but it's not one of Trane's better albums: while ""To Be"" (with Trane doing a surprisingly good job on flute) and ""Ogunde"" are winners, and the unpredictable song structure makes it hard to really get bored, there's some recycling - such as on ""Offering"", which nicks the opening solo of ""A Love Supreme"", and the title track, pretty much a copy of ""Offering"". This was Coltrane's final studio album - he would tragically die of liver failure later that same year."
5,Just listen to Side of the Road - your money is well spent,"This CD is an American music classic. This is roots music at its best. The selections may be familar to the casual fan because of cover versions by Mary Chapin and Tom Petty, but they do not match the intensity or honesty of Ms. Williams performance. ""Side of the Road"" alone makes this CD underpriced."
5,"Good Product, Good People","Product was of high quality, delivered timely. Hand addressed envelope was a nice touch. Highly recommend."
3,A little big...,"The stones that came were quite big for the mancala set that I bought.. This made it a little difficult to play..However, they were a nice color and there were a good number in the package for the money..."
1,Oh my God! Credulity has no limit!,"This is in answer to the person who correctly pointed out that the first book in the series said that there would be three books. That person wanted to know why there are now twenty books! Did you really think this guy was doing anything other than taking your money while persuading you to believe that god spoke to him? In a sane and moral society this kind of crap would be illegal to sell but since we live in a dog eat dog crapitalism, caveat emptor! I'm almost tempted to say that anyone stupid enough to buy/read his books deserve to be separated from their money and further confused about the nature of theology/philosophy."
5,This book will help you remember who you are,"I think this is NDW's most important book. It can be hard to read. Some of the points are pretty raw. But, if you can internalize them, experience their truth, it is a beginning to your understanding, remembering, of who you are. Other pointers are Enlightenment for Beginners by Chuck Hillig and writings by Alan Watts. A comforting, thrilling and familiar scenario for the future was given by James Redfield, The Celestine Prophecy.I really appreciate how NDW follows the processes all the way through to satisfying and logical conclusions, providing a hopeful view of the future and your continued presence in this cosmos.ktx"
3,Good for the price,"This works fine if your in a quiet place, but because the mic is in the earpiece, it picks up eveything that is going on around you if there are any other noises. But for [price], I still think it works pretty good."
5,Mic NOT in the cord,"This was my very first earpiece purchase before bluetooth phones/earpieces were financially available to me. LOL I loved this earpiece and its price so much that I bought like 3 of them! I ended up selling one of them to a friend (but only because she begged me) and keeping the other two for myself. I managed to break one of them and was grateful that I had the extra one to fall back on immediately because it was no longer for sale here. Once BT earpieces were available to me with a external adapter, I graduated from this unit. I have nothing bad to say about this unit & probably still have it in a box somewhere. I bought it simply because the microphone wasn't annoyingly located in the cord and it fit securely and comfortably in your ear. I recommended it to others."
1,poor sound quality,"This phones has great features,but very poor sound quality. Mostly sounds like you're in a tunnel even when in the same room as the base. The range is also extremely poor. Bought an extention to add on and can't use it in the next room without constantly cutting out. All in all, this phone stinks."
3,good to be use in usa only not for international country,"caller id designedly to use inside usa onlynot good for other country due to three digitRinger options: High, Low, Off ( low ringer look medial )system short of Integrated answering systemBelt clip not practiceenergy power 110 only not for internatinalsyestem poor inView stored number during calldate momth yearsyestem excellent inIntercom between handsets - for room/baby monitoringLED/LCD screenMulti-user expandableDimensions"
1,NOT HAPPY,The phone does not work well with a voicemail. I had a 2-line panasonic cordless before with no problems. the service has been terrible. I returned the phone for service with Uniden. It was sent Back with the Same problem. We have notified Uniden about the Problem. Two month later we are still waiting for the shipping package. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE.
4,Excellent PHONE!,"I did a lot of research for phones in this price range, and I LOVE this phone. I am on conference calls 4-5 hours a day, and I rarely fall below 2 bars (out of 3). The speaker phone is terrific as well, and the call history function is excellent, allowing you to scroll thru the last 50 or so calls that came in to you. The only thing I dont like about it is that it only saves the last 4-5 calls made, but this is a minor issue."
2,Good product but worst customer service,"I bought this phone for Xmas, nice product but it came with a factory defect regarding to the range very limited, I just can use in the room of the base, I tried to talk with some one by phone (1-800 of unidem) but no one answer just the electronic machine, I tried by the web and just received a email with a case number telling me that I will be contacted by some one soon,and I still waiting (march 31th).Nice phone, worst company"
1,Not a god buy,"I purchased this product and 4 weeks after i receiving it, It no longer works. The product does nothing at all For the price and shipping i would expect it to last longer than that."
2,It's just ok,"I bought this product to keep underneath my desk at work to keep my bottles cold. I have found that this item just does an ok job and was not really worth the $52 ( that's including the shipping I paid) for this item. I have also found that insulated lunch type bags with the gel ice packs do just as an effective job as the mini fridge can do. I would suggest you save your money, this mini fridge is not worth it."
2,High portability... poor temperature control,"The unit is small, portable, and easy to operate. I have not used it in the warm mode yet. The fridge keeps liquids cold. However, temperature cannot be adjusted (other than hot or cold) and sometimes the liquids inside get completely frozen. This fridge is OK for the car but caution should be taken if storing liquids overnight because of the freezing problem."
1,Quit working in under 3 months,The fridge is great for just a few tiny things - not big enough for Dr. Brown's larger bottles. Quit working in under 3 months. I emailed the company and haven't heard anything yet - during the work week... Spend a little more and get a larger fridge. Would be okay for the back of a car for about 2 cans of cola.
5,Care to Dance?,"This is a light dice game very fun for gamers and non-gamers alike. Very easy to explain, easy to start. The colors in my version don't match the dice (for instance, the purple person has pink dice). We pull this game out either to start the evening or end it, since it takes 15-25 minutes to play. It's the only way I'm going to get my husband to dance!"
3,Good info. but not for the money.,"The information provided in the book was quite helpful however $70.00 with the shipping and handling, was too much. Probably only worth about half that. So why did I by it? After reviewing other books on the same topic this one seemed to contain most of the specific information I was looking for so I ""bit the bullet"" and got it hoping that, while I cannot view all the material in the book before purchasing it, it may prove worthwhile once I can look through the whole thing. After doing so I still find it to be more expensive that it really should be. I would recommend not spending more than a maximum of $40.00 total for this book if you can get it anywhere for that. I bought the book new, but you can get a used copy cheaper. You can also rent it cheaper or get the kindle edition which is the cheapest way to go."
5,Fantastic!,"The big problem when writing a book about history of science, is how much background to include. If you don't include any background, the ordinary reader will not really get what's going on. Evans has instead written what can best be described as a two-fold book. It's both an introduction to astronomy and an introduction to history of astronomy! His explanations, and particularly his illustrations, are excellent. Both his scholarship and his writing are exceptional! Read it!"
4,Extremely Insightful,An excellent development of the history of astronomy detailed at the university level. Don't think the ancients were in any way less intelligent or sophisticated than we are! Here is your proof. I used the mathematics and history described in this book to develop a video about the history of science (zpeg.com)
2,OOOOOOH hum!!!!!,Too much narrator. Just could not get into the book. Cliches were a distraction and over done. I am glad it was free.
1,Bad,The author try's for humor that I could not find. Story is disjointed and I had a lot of trouble trying to follow it.
3,Entertaining Easy Read,"I just finished Calamity Jayne, and I did enjoy it. I would recommend it as a funny and easy read, but it is not at all ""amazing"". One thing that was amazing to me were the number of spelling and grammar errors. (Kindle Edition) I just hate that, it becomes a distraction. Back to Calamity, a silly and somewhat transparent 'mystery' that only the title character is unable to figure out, is still worth reading."
3,A pleasant diversion,"This book was well-written, although the folksy country talk was mildly annoying by the end. My favorite character was the rascally father of the male protagonist."
1,"Lots of ""ear candy"". Not much meat in the story","Jayne's comments were too cutesy. I didn't have much sympathy for her. It's not my type of story. I'm just learning about my Kindle, so I wasn't too choosy, when I picked it out."
5,Calamity Jayne (Calamity Jayne Mysteries),Thanks for having this product so handy on the internet. I enjoy the ease of downloading and being able to have reading material at my fingertips when I desire.
5,Light easy read,Light easy read. Sometimes you just want to escape and this is one of those books. I? Would love to see more Calamity adventures.
3,What a weird Movie,This movie definitely caught my attention with the strong female lead but it got a litle weird half way through the movie and it seemed to drag on forever. They should've ended the movie at least an thirty minutes earlier than they did. The ending was okay and the main character turned out to be a little to eccentric for my taste. I wouldn't recommend paying the amount of money a lot of ppl are asking because this movie isn't great enough to spend over 10.00 on.
3,A respectable live effort,"It's possible Impulse records released this live album to answer the popularity Coltrane received at the 1963 Newport Jazz Festival. All in all, this is a good record, but not great. The band is in top form as usual, but it doesn't showcase the Coltrane you know elsewhere like on ""Live In Seattle"". The album is worth buying for the 17 minute version of ""My Favorite Things"", where Coltrane really builds a long ascending solo. ""My Favorite Things"" also features McToy Tyner's gorgeous piano work that sounds just as beautiful here as it does on the original. ""I Want To Talk About You"" also has good playing from Coltrane, but the album as a whole doesn't stick out like other live efforts. Still, it's a good album for heavy Coltrane fans.For a sweaty, comprehensive look at Coltrane live, pick up the Village Vanguard box set."
1,Doesn't hold a charge and is breaks fast,"This is a very poor product from Panasonic. I have always purchased Panasonic cordless phones and had great luck. This unit met all my specifications. I was so excited when I ordered it.You cannot leave it off the charging station more than a couple hours or the batteries need to charge over night.Within 6 months 2 units were returned for repair. 6 months later they were bad again but the warranty was up.For the price I paid I should be writing a glowing review, instead I'm telling you to stay away from this product. It's no good and I'll never trust Panasonic again."
1,Battery life stinks!,"I have three of these phones including the base unit and guess what? The battery life on all three lasts a maximum of 30 minutes. I have called Panasonic and they are aware of this defect, yet have not recalled the phones. I was told to send them in to their service center for repair. According to the rep the defect is in the handset battery contact with the charger.To all you would be purchasers of this product, perhaps Panasonic has remedied the problem. But if they have not then BUYER BEWARE!!!!"
2,Could be better after all these years!,"I love all the features on this two line system which is why I originally bought it, however, I have had this expensive system for many years and had trouble with it from the beginning. After calling many times without satisfaction, my warranty expired and I was 'stuck'. I kept it just to 'wear it out'; then I needed additional handsets! The original one of two, cannot be heard except on speaker, which is the one I was trying to get fixed for so long.I'm surprised that the cost is still so high after so long, and the volume on the handsets is still not loud enough. I hate getting rid of something that cost so much, which is why I thought the new handsets would be a better investment than purchasing an entirely new system. Now, I'm stuck with an additional two handsets that cost me another $175.00!!"
4,Extra Handset,We have used this Panasonic phone for several years. Have not had any problems so far. Works really well!
2,Only 20 minute talk time?,"Great features. I like it very much except...The battery goes after only 20-30 minutes talk time! I have seen others reccomend several charge cycles before the battery life is good, but I have seen no improvement. I don't know if the problem is the battery, or the phone. I often have conference calls well over an hour, so for my application this phone is useless.For those wishing to reduce their time on the phone and their phone bill, perhaps this is a good phone."
1,Worst Phone I ever encountered on this planet,This is the worst phone i have ever seen in my whole life. The battery dies after talking only 2 minutes.We have the same problem with the base set and 3 other handset.NEVER BUY THIS ONE..
4,Good phone but batteries expensive to replace,"We purchased the Panasonic cordless phone system with 4 handsets in October 2002. Being at home all day I use all 4 handsets about equally multiple times per day. Unlike other reviewers I have not had problems with calls being jeopardised by short battery life on a regular basis but I do recharge each handset every day. However the batteries needed replacing in August 2003 and now again I have had to order new batteries after just over a year. It does get rather expensive - I have paid around $12 per battery online.Apart from concern about the longevity of the battery I am happy with the system - answering machine works well, good call quality, no intereference, etc.I just wonder if other (newer) technology might have better battery life."
1,BAD BATTERY LIFE!!!!,"This was and would be an excellent phone except for one thing - the battery life is horrible!!! I run a business from my home and want to be able to talk to my customers for more than 15 minutes without the phone dying and with this phone that can't be done! I have changed batteries, I have changed types of batteries, I have even followed the advice of another reviewer who suggested placing cardboard under the battery to insure contact. (For this much money I shouldn't have to use bits of cardboard to make my phone work!!!) And no - I don't have the booster on either! None of this has worked. After throwing this out I will NOT buy another Panasonic phone product. I had been a happy repeat customer until now! All in all - a great idea extremely poorly executed!!! Don't bother - this one is a MUST NOT buy!!!"
4,Better than Siemens,"I just purchased the TGA2740 (the 2-line version of the TGA2730) and am very happy with my purchase. I bought this system to replace the Siemens Gigaset system that I had been using. The sound quality on the phones is tremendous and the built-in speaker phone is fantastically convenient. I only see one other review for this product here, but I am not finding the same issues with the product that the other reviewer noted. I would highly recommend this phone system to anyone looking for an affordable, expandable cordless system. The only area for opportunity that I could offer Panasonic is to allow one to ""name"" the extension handsets (i.e. ""Kitchen"", ""Living Room"", etc) instead of having to remember which extension number corresponds to which cordless handset."
5,Love it,English Detective writing at its bests. Lots of twists and turns. The ending is very real. Reminds me of Justice for All.
2,Standard fare,"Let's see, the writing is slow and tedious, there is very little suspense, the ""main character"" is not even introduced until the book is almost half over. The revelations are interesting but do not really titillate the imagination, and parts are rather predictable. In the end, everything is wrapped up a bit too tightly and easily. One comes from this book with a sense of hollowness."
3,Beware of offensive language,"The book begins with Venetia Aldridge defending Gary Ashe on charges of murder, even though he was guilty. The next victim will be Aldridge herself, stabbed to death at her desk, a blood-stained wig on her head. Commander Dalgleish and his team investigate the shocking events, trying to locate the murderer.This book is for mature readers only. There are minimal uses of offensive language, but there is a description of pornographic pictures, a description of a dead, naked body, and descriptions of sexual encounters. Vocabulary in this book is also challenging. A good murder mystery, though!"
5,Cross watch from Silverbin,"The watch is so beautiful. My 16 year old granddaughter just loves it.I would recommend this to any teenage girl, not only because it's beautiful, but for the love it represents."
2,"Factually incorrect, knowledge of Hindi highly suspect!","As a student of cinema and history, I am amazed at the attention this book on the popular Indian cinema has been able to garner. The book is full of such obvious howlers as for instance the translation of BR Chopra's ""Naya Daur"" as not the ""New Epoch"" but as the ""New Race"". It seems that the writer has been somewhat overwhelmed by the rural tonga race included in the film. I wonder if, with that kind of understanding of the broadly ""Hindustani"" language, it is really possible to write the kind of seminal film and cultural study that this book is being so unabashedly advertised as by the likes of Robert Stam and the OUPs of this planet. Having gone through the book I have been able to find at least 71 similar mistakes. Just because India is far off and Hindustani an unknown quantity, one doesn't have to jump to Ms Chakravarty's defence."
1,enough of the tired academic approach and prose,"Alas, this could have been a book filled with enlightening explorations of the endless catastrophe called Russian/Soviet agriculture. Instead, we get tired recitations of fact mixed with analytical reviews of theories that lead the reader away from exactly the places where most readers will probably want to go -- to the farms of the ex-USSR, where real people are struggling with a monumentally inefficient system that's all but collapsed under its own weight. Can't this book give us a glimpse into that rality, rather than the mental constructs of the western academics? We'll have to wait for a better book to come along and help us out."
3,TOO SHORT TO REACH THE CENTER OF MY BACK,"I didn't have to open the package to know the brush was too short. It measures 13.75 inches tip to tip. I can reach the center of my back only by stretching my shoulder in a painful way. With a 4.5 inch grip that only leaves 9.25 inches to ""reach"" center. Although the listing did not give measurements, I know it is my fault for not demanding a length from the sellers before buying, but Most brushes I have purchased in the past were 16 to 22 inches. I am spending good money after bad by paying to returning it. Whether I get my money back or not I am still returning it. The brush would be a better hair brush than a back brush. I guess only small people wash their backs. The brush appears to be OK for those who can use it."
1,Earth Therapeutics Back Brush,It was nice while it lasted. It material that holds the bristles cracked and the bristles started coming out rendering this useless in just two weeks. Avoid this!
4,Bicycles Bring World Peace,"Here's another Reading Rainbow book for ya. While Levar Burton used this particular title as a springboard for discussing the history of the wheel, I'm going to use it to illustrate a simple recipe for world peace.First, show up uninvited to a foreign school shortly after the conclusion of a major war.Second, try not to scare the living daylights out of everyone present by asking to ride the school principal's bike. (They ride bikes a lot in Japan).Third, show off like crazy by doing insane bike stunts.If you follow those three steps with every single country, we will see total world peace from here on.Now go and learn some bicycle tricks."
4,Nice shirt.,"I do like the shirt. However, be aware that the Glock graphic is only on the left front chest and sleeve. There is nothing on the back of the shirt."
1,Pure Porno; Why is Lawrence Block Allowing a Reprint?,No Score refers to the title characters inability to complete the sex act with numerous partners throughout the story. Lawrence Block is one of my favorite authors. He must have written this book when he desperately needed the money. It should not have been republished
2,A Disappointment,"Okay, this is a good series and this particular book does not belong among the rest of the Teach Yourself. First, it will teach you how to play the scale notes, sharps, flats and so on. However after about 20 pages you get the idea the tunes included in the book are not anything you'd seriously want to play. Most are at least a hundred years or so old, under unrecognizable titles, and just plain silly. If they want to charge so much for this set, then update the music to things more current and some actual classical pieces.As for the CD and DVD, well, they're okay. The DVD is just great if all you want to do is watch a guy play the recorder. It's boring and is not very instructive.This purchase is, in my opinion, a waste of money."
