3,Alright,"These headphonrs are ok. They do block out other noises and increase the bass in the music but other than that they are just alright. The only other thing I like about these are that they actually stay inside my ears instead of always falling out. Personally, I still like my JVC heaadphones better.(The sound is better with these) But they are still worth it because they are cheap."
4,You get what you pay for,These are great little headphones. If you are looking for audiophile sound you are obviously not going to find it for under $10. These headphones work well but they are not noise canceling headphones as the way they are advertised might imply. I have only had them for a few weeks now but even if they stop working after half a year they will be worth it. I bought several and have no complaints at all.
3,Good Price....Poor Quality,"Bought these earphones 3 months ago and the right side doesnt work anymore. But they were only 5 bucks, cant really be mad about it. Sound Isolation is great though and they are comfortable."
1,Garbage,"I bought these ear buds four months ago and they've already broken. Everything is still intact, but the individual buds simply quit working, first one and then the other. I subjected them to the same day-to-day handling that I have other brands, and this is the first pair that have broken so easily. I hesitate to buy another Coby product in the future."
1,"Forget about quality, it won't stay on.","When the earphone industry was going in one direction -- toward making ergonomic earphones that fit your ears snugly with little effort (like the Panasonic HJE series) -- in come Coby with their cumbersome plugs. I was so hesistant to get them but went with all the positive reviews. What a disppaointment (because I bought 4, stupid me).My earlobes aren't particularly big or small, it's just 'normal'. And these plugs have to be shoved in just so they stay. If you don't understand what I'm saying, just look at the damn thing. It's like a miniature barrell. I've ordered some sound isolating earplugs to replace the ones they come with. Hopefully I'll be able get something out of it.I haven't written much about quality because it's almost irrelevant. Ok, when it does stay it gives out average sound quality. But seriously, you get much better stuff for the money (even at $3 in some stores, it's not a good bargain)."
4,Great value for the price,"Great value for the price. I bought 3 pair and used all three of them. I'm rough on headphones, so they go quick. I'm reordering more!"
3,Good for price,Great prices for small in-ear headphones. Quality of construction and sound are average. OK as a secondary headphones. Cables are weak and not going to last very long.
3,You get what you payed for,They are conventional headphones that are better than any heaphones. For 5 bucks it's a great deal... given that you have free shipping. Anything more than 5 bucks it's a waste of money.EDIT: After two months the noise is already gone... you get what you payed for.
4,"So far, so good","I've been using these earphones for about a month now, on my Kindle and on my desktop mostly for audiobooks. I find them pretty comfortable and that they sound good. They fall out of my ears sometimes, but I may just have weird ears."
5,great phones,"These phones rock. Clear sound, comfortable and cheap. Beat any phone I have ever tried."
3,coby ear buds,great sound quality. I just can't get the things to stay well in my ears. Which I don't think it's the ear buds as much as my ears. But when I have them on can't hear anything else around me.
1,You Truly Get What You Pay For,"At ~ 7.00 each, I said ""whatever, the reviews are good, and I'll buy 2 and save on the JBuds"". Well, that was in February, and 6 months later, I am forced to buy the JBuds because BOTH pairs of Coby's are now non-functional due to normal use. Hard to believe, I know. My actual iPod ones lasted two years, and were of similar sound quality. Buy cheap, expect cheap."
1,Don't stay in 8 year old's ear,"I bought these for my 8 year old son. However, they don't stay in his ears so he can't use them :-("
1,Fantastic sound... while they last :(,"Gotta say that I agree with many of the recent reviews for these -- It appears Coby's quality control has gone downhill, or more likely, they've adopted lower cost suppliers and components to keep costs down... and the result is that these earphones are not durable at all. Didn't even survive a year of gym use. Sound is great before they break though... will be buying a better product rather than keep ordering these on the regular... Maybe Amazon should do a Subscribe and Save on these since they break down on such a frequent basis that they'll need to be replaced regularly ;p"
1,ordered twice - broke twice,"this product broke twice even though i gave it the benefit of the doubt and ordered a second time, a piece of junk not worth the money"
5,The perfect pair,"These earphones are the best pair I have ever owned. The last pair I owned were ""high tech"" and cost about $20, they didn't last long at all. With this pair I can plug it in my laptop on the lowest volume and hear quite plainly while blocking out most background noises. And believe me my earphones go through alot, from being tangled to wrapped tightly around my zune, and occasionly getting caught in my bike, but this wonderful pair are great quality, very durable, and best of all a great low price! I highly recommend this pair and probably will never buy any other."
1,Trash!,What was I thinking buying Coby? My Ipod no longer works just because I pluged them in. Muddy sound at its best.
4,It worked for us!,I poured this on my almost hairless dog once a week for 3 weeks and her hair has all grown back. She is pretty once again. I don't know what she had or why she itched so much and scratched all her hair off but since using this stuff it has all grown back and we have our happy dog back. I will warn you though. This stuff stinks real bad. Make sure to use it outside and wear gloves. Also remove all jewelry. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 only because of the smell.
5,Seger's Core,"This is an album that defined Segar in the early 70's. Rambling Gambling Man is a tune that resembled Seger's music career. Another great tune that kicks ass is 2+2, which puts Seger on the rock & roll map. This early album is must for any true Seger fan."
4,Bob Seger's chart debut,"Ann Arbor,Michigan-born Bob Seger began his musical career when he was a teenager and did record some music that unfortunately was never charted. This 1969 release marked the debut of Seger's entry on the pop/rock charts. This group,credited as The Bob Seger System,scored with the Top 20 hit,the title track. Seger's bandmates,at the time of these recordings,were never inducted into his later famous band,the Silver Bullet Band. However,when Seger formed SBB in 1975,they performed the title track for the first SBB album,LIVE BULLET. Seger didn't rise to fame until the 1976 release of LB. The other songs are cool."
5,My college students use this book to learn to be happier.,"I have used Carson's book for seven years in my college social psychology course entitled Self and Others. I have been amazed at how many students use the ideas in the book to make real changes in how they think and feel about themselves,and how they interact with others. I laugh, cry and cheer when I read many of their papers. Thank you Richard Carson."
4,When you care enough to send the very best.,"I'm sure the above statement will bring the trolls, but that is my opinion.If you're a machinist already, you probably have at least 5 of these already and why are you reading this? You know what you like and what works for you.For those new to machining: yes, it is expensive but if this is what you earn money with, it's worth the investment. If you're a hobbyist, then you will most likely not need something this accurate. Well taken care of, these things will last longer than you.It shipped pretty quickly, and arrived in fine shape."
3,hard to read but wothwhile,"I have found this play very exciting to read, but the getting in was a little bit difficult. But I admire the variety of the vocabulary that Shaffer made use of. He handled a couple of topics, which are very interesting: I.e. the existence of god, different cultures and their organisation, religion and a motive that goes through the whole story: The word. Shaffer encourages the reader to make his own opinion about questions like: Is it justified to break the word if you act in consciousness and for the good of your crew?Pizarro's problem as an illegitimate son and his existential questions are not discussed. Something that makes this play very special is the fact that Old Martin occurs time after time and tells about his experiences and the happenings, when he had been in Peru.In short: + Interesting play with a demanding vocabulary - Hard to get in"
1,Don't waste your time,"This was the stupidest (if that's even a word) movie I have ever seen, and believe me, I have seen THOUSANDS of movies. First off, it's dubbed in English. There are no options to have the correct language with English subtitles. Given that, and it wouldn't have been all that bad, if the voices weren't so comical. I actually found myself laughing in places because the voices were totally wrong for the mood of the movie. Secondly I found the movie boring and not as good as another film I had seen about the same subject matter. Trust me and look for other movies with this subject matter, there are far better ones out there. The ""cat scene"" that every one talks about is disgusting and I felt they really could have done without that. What purpose did it serve? I don't get it and wish someone would explain it to me. It wouldn't have made any difference if they had left that scene out, and frankly I wish they had. All in all, I'm sorry I purchased this, it was a waste of money."
1,Absolutely no value - Animal Cruelty at its worst.,"Putting aside the entire subject of the atrocity, this movie is absolutely horrendous just for the infamous cat scene. I strongly disagree with any attempts to justify such unnecessary cruelty as art and I think that one scene waters down his the entire message of the film. After watching that scene, the rest of the movie is simply about the shock of seeing an innocent animal being slaughtered for entertainment.I am missing point? Probably. But when someone spews out garbage like this one, I hardly can be blamed. In the interest of art, I would be more entertained in seeing the director being thrown to a pack of hungry rats. That would truly be educational."
5,The True Proven Secret to Wealth!,"This book holds the secret to wealth. If you have been searching and looking for a way to unlock the flood gate to prosperity, this book has the answers. Vitale takes the law that never fails and gives the proper perspective on the whole topic of giving regardless of your spiritual background. His discussion covers both spectrums from the greedy to the most generous of heart. Great Money-Making Secret in History outlines a wealth of resources for additional information on related topics and provides some interesting ideas that anyone can implement. The bottom line is give and anything can happen! What are you waiting for? Read this book today!! It's never too late!"
4,I DO RECOMMEND,This is a perfect book for all those who want to find out what the secret of getting rich and happy is!
2,Didn't buy the stupidity,"This book has many things going for it. Current problem novel, a few great girl characters, and a quick-moving plot with heart. However, I just couldn't buy the fact that the girls did not know what would happen when they accused their teacher of abuse. They did it to get out of class. That's the best motive the author could come up with??!! Talk about making preteen girls look quite stupid. I could buy the ringleader, Jenna's motive, but the two friends Clair and Suzanne? It was disappointing how little thought was given to making their story more real. Why, besides the act of friendship, would they like about something like that just because their friend asked them too. Girls today would understand the consequences of such action of lying like this. This single fact ruined the novel for me. Yes it was well-written, but without a credible story line, what's the point?"
2,Expiration date: 20 years ago,Maybe 20 years ago this was a wonderful read but right now as we know and use computers is some kind of silly story. The medical part was so tiny because MC wanted to write about computers not a medical thriller.
3,weak plot,"I did not much like this book. The plot is weak and unconvincing. Hardly any action in it. Just some scenes of brutality to add some ""spice"". The ending was better than the rest of the book"
3,"Not what I expected, but a good read.","The book has a good story by itself, sometimes its boring but it comes to be O.K. It has technical parts very well described. I really enjoyed the descirption of the procedure of implanting the electrodes in Benson's brain. The only bad thing was the ending. I almost threw the book through the toilet when I finished. But it's a good story worth reading."
2,This CD is Instrumental,"There is no singing or lyrics on this CD. The music is great but I wanted vocals. Could be my fault. Maybe I could have read it more closely and maybe it said that it was all instrumentals but in any case, only buy this if you want the music and not vocals. I still love everythins David Foster has done but he has worked with some awesome singers and his work is better with the singers included."
1,Not a good choise,"Followed the instructions perfectly, spent about an hour making sure both the windshield and the mirror button were immaculate. The mirror fell off the very next day. Waste of money, especially when I'm trying to save every penny for tuition."
5,A Hit!,"I got this game to entertain my four year old on a plane ride. As soon as he started playing it, he was hypnotized. Saved us during a flight, at dinner and on car rides. A must have for a boy."
4,Great!,My son has played this game more than any other of his Leapster games! It has just enough video game appeal mixed with learning! I must confess that I find it fun to play as well.
4,A middling tribute album,"After spending the last few years wandering other musical landscapes, I rediscovered Leonard Cohen this year (years after being a mega LC geek in school) and especially wanted to seek this album out again.Compared to Famous Blue Raincoat (much shorter but much, much more luminous), I'm Your Fan is middling. What's up with the two covers of Tower of Song? Why is the cover of Suzanne so freaking boring? But then there are the beautiful plusses -- A Singer Must Die, the funky cover of Don't Go Home With Your Hard-On (who wouldn't want to hear THAT at a wedding?) and the oft-mentioned version of Hallelujah. I really like the French version of Avalanche (I didn't get the original for many years after this and was very surprised as my hand translated version was very different).Bottom line: if you want 1 LC tribute CD, get Jennifer Warnes's. If you want 2, get this one too."
2,I'm Your Fan,"""Hallelujah"" by Nick Cave in this album does not approach the rendition of ""Hallelujah"" by Bono in the other tribute album, ""Tower of Song"".Further, I have no idea why every artist on the album is photographed with a banana in the inlay card."
5,"Interesting, imaginative, ""original"" covers!","The bands who cover the songs of Leonard Cohen sound like they are true fans and have been singing their versions of the songs for years and are happy to finally get them on record. The artists run the gamut from That Petrol Emotion, through The Lilac Time, The House of Love, James, R.E.M. and George Oryema. The highlights for me are ""The Stories of the Street"" as performed by That Petrol Emotion, ""Take This Longing"" by Peter Astor, ""Who By Fire"" by the House of Love and John Cale's heartbreaking rendering of ""Hallelujah"". Tribute albums are usually a high risk purchase (did anyone else buy ""Surprise Your Pig"", the terrible tribute for R.E.M.?), but I'm Your Fan is well worth it."
4,Helpful material,"This book is very interesting and helpful for the body builder seeking the best nutrition etc. Even though I own many new nutritional books, I still learned many facts on foods. This book was ahead of it's time."
4,Works for Nissan Armada,"Since the Armada and the Titan share the same front end, I figured this receiver would work on my 2004 Armada. Turned out it did, and it works well. I use it for a front mounted bike rack.If you do buy it for an Armada, you will need to cut away the middle section of the gray spoiler that runs along the bottom of the front bumper cover. Once that section is removed, the receiver sits perfectly at the bottom of the bumper cover.I had my buddy who is a mechanic install it. He said it was not an easy install because of the way some of the nuts needed to be inserted into the frame rails, but I think no drilling, cutting (other than the plastic spoiler) or welding was required."
3,review,Not as good as live in London. Did not know some of the performers. Not the same performers as live in London. Maybe it will grow on me.
4,Mantas with TEETH,"This was a page turner for sure, despite the tiny fonts! Easy to keep track of the characters. Semi realistic and believable most of the time. Scientific, but always with an explanation.Great for both sexes."
2,P U,"This book is a stinker. I would have given it one star, however if I am able to read through the whole thing I have to give it two...and I did. I have a crazy imagination and am willing to accept most any premise when it comes to fiction, however a flying, air breathing manta ray with an Einstein IQ?"
3,Enthralling but flawed...,"I was fascinated by the prospect when seeing this book cover, and I was even pleased as I enjoyed the first three quarters of this book. Not being a biologist, I was ready to accept the underlying evolutionary precepts that led to the super-beasts portrayed here. I also felt Dave did a good job presenting the characters on deck. Unfortunately, for me, fiction relies on one immovable pillar: believability within the realm built by the author; and the last quarter of the book fails completely in that regard. No, I don't believe government employees turn over authority and equipment to lay people ""just because."" I also can't accept that certain aerial accidents can bypass the laws of physics for convenience of story. I hope Dave makes another effort, however, because he had me for three quarters of a book. I'd love to see him take that storytelling quality all the way through to a flawless fourth."
1,Word of Faith Theology,"I would not recommend this book. Jackie believes in the Word of Faith doctrine. As a Christian we can ask God to protect us and give us a healthy childbearing experience, but we CANNOT command it of him or of ouselves. We need to ask that his will be done and not tell him what his will should be. For more information see http://www.gospeloutreach.net/wordfaith.html"
5,Great cat toy!,My cat LOVES this toy. It is the perfect size and shape and the catnip is really strong. I will definitely be buying another one of these!
4,Panasonic GigaRange phone system,"Good quality, but pricey. Considering the long term advancements in telecommunications technology, coupled with highly automated, relatively cheap production costs, someone in the sales chain is cutting a fat profit on this phone, particulary the handsets. In addition, the instructions could be improved: learning curve with respect to features tends to be steep."
2,The beginning of the end,"I listened to this album and found that it is a really struggling album. I have no problem with singer ""Johnny Edwards"", it's more the song-writing.The songs are either a generic rocker or a long, generic ballad. There's no surprises and the song-writing is no longer catchy and concise but instead the songs seem to meander and take too long to get to the point. Every song is somehow dragged out over four minutes, leading to a long album without much variation in tone.It's true this album could get 2 1/2 becuase the guys really tried to rock, and the singer is in fine voice. The opening track 'Low-down and dirty' has that classic foreigner sound but the album soon descends into early 90's hard rock mediocrity. The ballads never do anything to stand out as original or well-thoguht out.Overall, the production is weak and the finished product sounds very fromulaic."
1,Foreigner Without Lou Gramm,Foreigner with Lou Gramm is like Van Halen without David Lee Roth or Journey without Steve Perry. It just ain't the same. Yuck.
2,Some Relevant Details,"I wanted to point out a few things that weren't clear when I bought these weights:1. Each band is equipped with removable weights (2 1lb bars each) so you can lighten them if you need. However, the inserts are not made of sand, but of metal, and are very hard and can bruise your ankle bone if you leave them in.2. The box says that these are NOT to be used for running or walking.3. They are too big for me, I'm a size 4 female with small ankles and I positively swim in these. So be wary if you want them to fit snugly.My rating is partly based on disappointment, I bought these because I thought as they were designed for women they would be small enough to fit me, or at least adjustable. And I thought I could use them for hiking."
4,Does the trick,"When I use all the weights in this, it fits well on my ankle. However, when I take some of the weights out, it fits poorly. I don't have a particularly small ankle so I was surprised that a danskin product would not at least try to accomodate a woman's ankle. It is a good product for me when I use all 10 lbs.It is made well and I trust it will last for many years to come."
2,not ankle weights,"the fact that you can adjust the weights is great, the idea to wear them on your ankles doesn't work well. they are huge even on the biggest ankles of the whole wide world.i made them into above the calves weight, and that is the only place they stay on...so adjustable ankle weights means, you can adjust the weight, nothing else.the material they are made out of is great, it's super soft on your skin..."
3,Hydraulic Robot Arm,"When my son first received this toy, he constantly played with it. It wasn't hard to put together. Unfortunately, I guess the ""cool, neat"" factor or I guess I could also say that the thrill is gone. Such as kids are. He hasn't played with it since."
5,Great Collection!,Always loved Marc Antoine's music but never own any. So as a starter I bought this CD and it's great. I've listented to his music since late 90's. It is truly smooth jazz.
5,excellent!,"Wheather driving, cooking or sitting and reading, you will tap your foot, wiggle your hips or nod your head to the music!"
5,Great Resource,This is a great resource not only for preachers but for people wanting to go more indepth into each book of the Bible. It's really easy to use and read. A must have!
5,Just what the mechanic ordered!,"Great condition and timely delivery. Haynes manuals leave a lot to be desired as compared to say a Bentley manual for a VW product, but hey, at least this one was inexpensive."
2,Bland and Boring,"This book is poor imitation Michener, largely due to the fact that the writing is incredibly bland. While I learned things about the history of London, I had a hard time finishing the book, and only the curiosity whether or not the famous coins were going to be rediscovered kept me reading to the end."
3,"Lots of History, but ...","There is a lot of history here to be sure, but with the constantly changing characters it is difficult to connect with any of them. Ever 100 pages or so, the author begins another period of London's history and with it naturally comes new characters. You are never with a character long enough to really care. I personally found the author's method of following seven (or more?) different families through history tedious. I was constantly referring to the family trees that are provided to try to figure out who everyone was. It was a book that you have to work at to enjoy. I give it 3 stars for the vast amount of information that is covered - you WILL learn a lot, but can't give it any more than that due to the choppy feel of the story. If you are reading for the history lesson alone, you will like it. If you wanted a great story too, you may want to choose something that doesn't cover quite so much history in one book."
2,Just slightly amusing,"The characters are poorly drawn, not particularly sympathetic and appear to be only vehicles for conveying a history lesson. If it were not for the occasional, and fun, etomology lesson, this tome just might become only the second book I've ever failed to finish (and I've slogged through a vast number of books).Although Michener's history is suspect, his volumes are far more amusing and this book, as a novel, does not compare."
4,"Not as Good as 'Sarum', but Worth the Read","Written in the same structure as Sarum, Rutherfurd's London comes alive with the same historical scope and breadth, though not with the same level of warmth and enchantment. This is still, however, one of my favorite books and highly recommend it for anyone who enjoys English history, general history, or historical fiction."
2,A huge disappointment,"After reading wonderful reviews of this book in many places, I bought it to read during a cross-country trip. About a tenth of the way into it, I found the writing to be uneven, the coincidences unbelievable, and my natural desire to identify with and care about characters thwarted. Rutherfurd's book alternately lectures on British history and provides barely connected narrative from century to century (his chosen method of exposition). Frustrated, I struggled to finish the damn book. After a man at a movie theatre saw me carrying the book, told me of his similar frustrations with it (and with Rutherfurd's Russka as well), and suggested I simply abandon it on the nearest table, I took his advice, and did. I've read a dozen books since then which are infintely better than Rutherfurd's London!"
3,In the style of Michener,"If you like Michener, you'll probably enjoy this book. I don't think Rutherfurd is quite as talented a writer as Michener, but he also didn't spend 100+ pages at the beginning of the book boring the reader with his geology descriptions. As with any book covering so many centuries and so many people, it was hard to keep track of all the characters and their relationships. I do wish there had been more happy outcomes and not so many sad ones."
4,Very interesting complete historical overview of London...,"This book was fasinating. Once I began reading it, I realized I knew very little about the extensive history of London. Now having read it, I, for the first time, am really interested in visiting London to see first hand everything I've been reading about. So interesting were each of the chapters, I often found myself going onto the Internet to read more on various non-fictional characters or for more about the history or pictures of various structures. The author did a great job of telling the story through the lives of generations of several families and the end ties neatly with the beginning."
5,"i was blown away, and positively could not put it down.","this is truly a good read. the pages almost turned themselves! mr. rutherfurd has a very real talent for taking the reader back through time, and he is able to cover a huge topic very satisfyingly. his characters seemed to come alive, and their stories are realistic. this book makes me want to go to london, so that i can visit the places he describes so vividly. i highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys history with their fiction. i can guarantee that i will be purchasing and reading all of edward rutherfurd's other titles now."
5,Riveting,Was a brilliant read kept me interested from the start characters are great first of his books I've read will be getting the rest
2,How About A Proofreader?,"My two stars are based not on the narrative itself, but on the fact that this book (at least in the Kindle edition) is shamefully poor in terms of editing and proofreading. There are commas where there should be none, no commas or periods when needed, quotation marks opened and closed inappropriately, and so on. It's incredibly annoying and distracting. This may seem like a minor quibble, but if I'm going to spend my time reading a 1200 page book, it should at least be grammatically correct. Is that too much to ask for, Ballantine Books?"
5,The Modern Parent's Keepsake Book,"I'm using this for both of my children. It is easy to fill out and there's plenty of room for sentimental items. Love that you can just tape in their annual school photos--both individual and class ones. At the end of every school year, kids can write their names and it's neat to see their penmanship improve. No fuss, practical and sentimental all at once!"
3,Busy Mom with alot of PICTURES!,"I love this book for my 5 yo who has been in Preschool for 2 years now and we have so many pictures and great things to remember. That instead of putting them in a album with her sister's pictures too. She has it all to herself. When her sister starts Preschool, I will do the same for her..."
4,Only goes to grade level 5,I love this book except for the fact that it only goes through grade 5. I really wanted something for K-12. I think I will keep it though because it is like a 3-ring binder and I can add pages if my daughters want to.
2,"20 Years ago, a club called Paradise","Non-Bostonians who have seen the ""Live in Boston"" U2 DVD were probably a bit puzzled, when halfway through one of the songs Bono sings out ""Paradise...20 Years ago....A Club called Paradise"". The line is a reference to a Boston club called ""The Paradise"" where they played one of their first shows in the US sometime in late December, 1980.There is much discussion among casual U2 fans I know as to where they played their very first gig in the US. (Some say New York, some say Boston.) I decided to get this book and settle the argument.Both sides are somewhat right. Although U2 played their first concert in New York, WBCN in Boston was the first radio station in the US to play their music. Carter Allen details how he picked up a import single of their first record and was able to get the station music director to ok him putting it on.And such did greatness get its' start."
4,Finding Wlado,"I love Waldo books. It really helps teach my godson focus and let's us spend some time together. With everything there is on each page to look at, I can spend an hour with him easy and he doesn't even notice that he went without a video game or the tv for an hour (or more)! Also, we went to our favorite zoo the other day and he notices so much more. We have 4 of the six Waldo books. He's already put book 5 on his wish list."
4,Too small for older eyes but perfect for children,I gave this to my grand niece (actually I am too young for a grand niece). It is too small for older eyes but perfect for children...a great take away book and does not need adult interaction.
5,Excellent Home Workout,"A friend of mine recommended I check out this workout. I run and hit the gym regularly, but I was looking for a fitness DVD I could do at home to stay in shape. I like the instructor--Nicholas Stone. He's positive without being overbearing and provides solid instruction. I found he's very easy to follow even if the workout itself is tough. One of the best things about the workout is that he keeps it moving by having a lot of transitions between standing and floor. You exercise a lot of muscle groups with it.He relates a lot of the moves to an MMA fight, but it's definitely for a regular person looking for a good workout. I've watched some MMA fights since I started doing the workout, and I can recognize some of the moves from the DVD, like muay thai knees strikes and the triangle choke abs.The standing to floor exercise rotations add a good interval effect. I'm guessing I probably burn about 600-700 calories combining the main workout with the undercard. I recommend it."
4,Very Nice Work,"This CD comes with a 1 hour DVD of a sunset at Key West that includes the music. This is in addition to the regular Audio CD.I found this music to be good chill. Wonderful ambience, it does remind you of setting on a dock in the ocean with a cocktail(s). It does have a good driving backbone to it. I really enjoyed it. I cant really say which is a standout groove, but theres no need for that. Like most chill music, the CD encompasses you if you let it. Good stuff, I advise getting a copy. For $9.95, you cant go wrong."
2,sins of the fleshshould have been getting away with evil,how could fern michaels write such a book like this garbage. i'll never buy another book by this author. i now see WHY her books are not five star stories.she actually didn't end the story after that crazy girl got away with all the evil things she did. she made all her caracters stupid. i resent how she took a decent beginning and tore the ending up so badly. this was my first purchase BY her POOR writing AND MY LAST ONE.SHE NEEDS TO CHECK OUT THE GREAT AUTHURS & LEARN SOMING FROM THEM
3,"Great eyeliner, terrible container","The quality of the makeup in this product is superior. It goes on smoothly, smudges well and then stays on all day without budging. The dark aubergine color really complements my hazel eyes.The downside is that the tube is incredibly cheap. It requires a huge effort to almost *push* the eyeliner out of the tube, and then if you go too far, won't retract. It's literally the same cheap container as the one found in the free gift, with a cheap smudger tacked on the end.Come on, Clinique. When I pay more than drugstore prices, I expect better than drugstore quality. This tube was markedly worse than plenty of the drugstore brands I've used in the past."
3,Santo en Atacan Las Brujas,"It was dark and mysterious movie. Santo was a gem. This is a great movie for Halloween, especially you want a wrestling kick."
3,Better than its boring title,"Dale Evans is the singer of an all girl band. She goes to Utah to sell her grandfather's ranch, that way her band will have money to put on their show. Only Roy isn't pleased with this, so he lies to her about its location. Add Gabby Hayes, romance, and some bad guys and this is an enjoyable Roy Rogers movie. Dale is very cute in this movie and she has a few solo numbers. The only thing that doesn't seem quite right with this movie is the change of her hair from brunette to blonde with no explanation."
2,Not as good as I hoped,"This is a ""Biography"" of the Astor Family. But to try and put that much history into less than an hours show is very difficult.Please I did notice some errors in the presentation.I am afraid I would not recommend this purchase, as much as I would like to."
4,Very Helpful-Great product!,"This product is very helpful. We are 5 in the family and it works just like a normal dishwasher. It just needs a smart yet simple installation and you are hassle free. Though it's not as convenient as a built in dishwasher, it's a good choice than handwashing. Recommend it! Sure do."
4,Jolson still King,"Even the seasoned Jolson fan who has read all of the biographies and discographies of their idol will find this engaging portrait of the incomparable Jolson. Richard Grudens patented profiling give a well-rounded view of Jolson as seen by those who knew him and were influenced by him. This book could also be subtitled ""Jolson for Dummies"" as it illustrated the appeal that Jolson still holds for fans worldwide who weren't even born when he departed this earth in 1950. Grudens goes further than other authors by capturing the legacy of Jolson."
1,formula writing,"The Romantics, tries to use the old formula of Indians trying to amuse the west but fails in the process. Inspite of the excellent print quality of the Indian edition, the story just fails to take off. The problem-- too many formulae. Examples-- naked sadhus, the ghats of varanasi, whites searching for spirituality, dirty mother India etc etc. Mishra has just missed the elephants and snakecharmers...but just about! There were a tremendous possibilities even in this hackeneyed storyline, yet Mishra does not sem cabable of exploring them. As such the story never excites you. But at times can really put you to sleep. So avoid this book!"
3,Smooth and soft like Banarasi Saree!,Romantics is a gentle tale of young Samar's intense interludes from Varansi to Dharamshala via Pondicherry. It is narrated in the genre of a travelogue interspersed with the protagonists psycho-social and sexual traumas of approach avoidance conflicts. The book meanders through various viginettes all of them promising to build up to a crescendo but never doing so. A very readable book but at the end of it all you are left with a feeling of anticlimax.
4,Very Good Teacher,"I borrowed this tape from our library and it is a very good learning source. Tony Couch is an excellent teacher and employs a style that can be copied by students at all levels. I have only been painting for less than 1 year but have been able to follow his instructions and am starting to ""get it"". The title was a little misleading for me. I thought he was going to show various ways to paint water, rocks, and trees but it is actually 1 full demo painting containing each of these elements. This painting is a bit more confusing that in the other Couch videos I have seen but he tells the viewer what he is trying to do at every step so the insight into his process is worth more than just duplicating this 1 painting. Tony is very good at demonstrating moisture & value control. The presentation, editing, and audio in this tape are generally good and I would recommend it to anyone who likes Tony's painting style."
4,Wet on wet watercolor technique,"Tony Couch is one of the best in wet on wet technique. If you would like to improve this way of painting watercolors, you must buy this DVD."
2,Hookless,"Okay, so, yeah, the last album was pretty darn good for what is essentially light-weight goth metal. They looked really silly but, hey, some good hooky music. This album, after two complete plays, fails to move me. I really wanted to like this album. But, man, bad production and hook-less songwriting dooms it. Just nothing grabs me, sorry. Best thing on the album is probably the toothless DM cover. This is a good example of a band writing with too much pressure from the label and themselves. They played it safe and they got safe. Congratulations. The production: too much high-end. Geez, I'm getting tired of this brassy metal production of late (see In Flames' last few for the same basic problem). Metal drummers: stop riding the cymbals and play percussively. Check out Tool if you want to hear how percussion is done right for metal. Thumbs down on this one, sorry. Buy Killswitch's last disc instead if you want cutting-edge ""new"" metal."
2,Does not sound like the great band that they are.,"The thing I loved the most about lacuna coil was that there music had feeling, like the song entwined off of comilies. This album however lacks any feeling it just seems that they tryed to be heavier. I Have all four of the lacuna coil albums and this is by far my least favorite, If they keep going in this direction I will probably not buy another album of thiers."
2,Stick to Comalies,"If you loved Comalies, forget it. This won't work for you. It happens, artists here and there, now and then let out some stuff you really do not deserve to listen to. You may save a song or two, but after such a great rendition (Comalies), this would only please a ""pop"" oriented audience that suddenly decided to listen to something marginaly different. Forget about it. I'm sure the band will."
3,Not so quick to play,"First of all the table was broke and was necessary to wait 10 more days to finally has it changed.It was necessary 2 persons to set the table and was hard to do it because the legs didn't fit well where they were supposed to fit. For one leg I actually used the help of a hammer.After the table was set, was just fun. It's a simple and nice table."
2,Stick with the original,"It seems that whoever was behind Legacy tried to get it some name recognition by signing up acts like Elton John (""Don't Stop""), the Goo Goo Dolls (""I Don't Want to Know"") and matchbox twenty (""Never Going Back Again""), plus tapping up-and-coming Irish group The Corrs for ""Dreams."" While it was a game attempt to inject new life into these songs, it didn't make for an album of songs that even remotely touched their originals.The worst offenders of the lot were Shawn Colvin's bland, emotionless rendering of ""The Chain,"" matchbox twenty's overproduced nod to Lindsey Buckingham's ""Never Going Back Again,"" and The Corrs' dreadfully sing-songy version of ""Dreams."" As for Sister Hazel covering ""Gold Dust Woman,"" I'd rather hear Courtney Love's version.I'm not saying that the idea of doing a tribute album in itself is a bad one, just give us artists who have the artistry and the emotion to pull it off."
4,To the max,This cd was so good that my seven year old daughter sits and listens to it! I think thats says it all
2,A disappointing release from a great band.,"I've been a Savatage fan for years. I found nothing wrong with the evolution from power metal to prog metal. I felt ""D.W.D."" was possibly their best, next to ""T.D.A.C."" and ""Sirens"". But when I first heard this, I felt horrible. This is rather boring. I'm sorry to say it, but I think Savatage repeated a ""Fight For The Rock"", but in a different way. Oh how I wish they didn't do this album. If you like a sloooowwww album, get this...otherwise, don't."
5,Nothing better,Rather than write 200 paragraphs on how good this album is.. I leave you with this: Damn!Thanks.
1,terrible album,I didn't like this album at all and Keith Murray tried to go mainstream and pop on this album. This album is trash. LOL@Candy Bar song hahahaha.
5,Fabulous Popcorn for Diet Popcorn Lovers,"This popcorn is fantastic - we use this one at work - No transfats,so it is the healthy option out there. Yes we miss the butter, etc but our arteries don't."
3,Ringo the Songwriter,"What makes this album sort of special is that Ringo wrote six of these songs. I don't care much for ""Out on the Streets"", but the others are charming and very enjoyable. I really wish that Ringo would have insisted on writing the whole album. Of the four songs that Ringo didn't write, ""Tango All Night"" is the only one I like a lot. Like the song ""Monkey See Monkey Do"" on Ringo's BAD BOY album, these cover versions are kind of an embarrasment to Ringo. The best song here is the melodic and sweetly nostalgic ""Gave It All Up."" ""It's No Secret"", ""Gypsies In Flight"", and ""Simple Love Song"" are nearly as good. This is not one of Ringo's best albums, but it is still a must-have if you like Ringo. Note to Paul McCartney: In return for Ringo's ""Wings"", how about recording a song called ""Ringo Starr."""
2,Wait for an update,"There is a lot of good information here, but much of this book is laughably out of date. Save your money for the next edition."
3,A different kind of Eric Sloane book,"Unlike other Eric Sloane books, this book is a collection of columns he wrote for the newspaper. While his other books give one an appreciation for the tools and traditions of yesterday, this book offers a bit more criticism of the present day, and Sloane comes across as crotchety at times. Also, the writing style is more hokey, in the style of a folksy newspaper column. I recommend any other Sloane book instead, such as American Yesterday or Our Vanishing Landscape. If you've read all the others, then this book offers a few more interesting tidbits that make it worthwhile."
3,not very much string for the price,We were both surprised when this arrived and it has very little string on the spool for the price. Very disappointed and will not be purchasing this again
1,this is the wrong part!,The spool is the wrong part...I wanted a replacement spool for a weed eater xr70...and I recieved a spool for a different model the spool pictured on the web page clearly showed the xr70 on the package...how can I get the propper spool?
5,Great Product,Smackdown Vs Raw 2006 is a great game because of all the great graphics. It is like you are in the game wrestling. The worst thing about this game is the loading. It takes about 2-3 minutes to load. The people in the stands look like they are in real life watching the wrestling match. This game is the greatest game I have ever played since I have had a Psp.
2,kill the pain!,"Nothing's worse than playing a terrible game on an unsuccessful gaming system. That's exactly what we have here. Granted, WWE Smackdown vs Raw 2006 could have been a whole lot worse, but it's still nothing to cheer about. No one will remember this game in 15 years."
4,Hot Read!,"I was surprised at the heat and passion this story carried. The interaction between the characters is slow and builds, along with adding spunk, stubborness and determination...and a vacation that gets detoured.I recommend picking up this jewel and guess you will have it finished in a day...2 days max."
3,Not Exactly what I thought,"The Teapot I received had a plastic strainer part, not metal. However, once I notfied the owner they rectified the problem immediately. I like the lightness, but would prefer a stainless steel liner."
3,A Young Director's First Movie,"Length:: 4:02 MinsThis is one of those DVD's that the more you watch it, the more the story grows on you! This short video will help you in your buying decision.You may want to check out these videos as well (Video Reviews by this Reviewer are provided at the locations below)Geek Charming (Two-Disc DVD + Bonus DVD + Best Friend Charm Set)What IfCutbackStanding Firm"
3,Pretty but not well made,"These bracelets are pretty but not very well made. The wire was sticking out at the ends which scratched my wrist. I re-strung the beads, which solved the problem. It was a lot of hassle for a couple of bracelets."
5,Great Wireless Keyboard,Great small form wireless keyboard. built-in track pad makes it easy to move around without having to have a side desk or place to put a mouse.
4,Quality Case,"The quality and size of the case is as advertised. The only downside is that between the description and the photos, the case does not accurately show ithe interior and I was somewhat surprised when the product arrived. All in all it is a quality product, but wish I had a better idea of what the interior looked like so that I might have considered other products."
1,"It would be great, if it worked!!!","I love wooden toys and have purchased many for my son. I was so disappointed with this product. It's very cute and seems like it would be very fun, but it doesn't stick very well to my high chair surface. Thus, making it unusable."
3,A great YA read!,"This is a book about a group of high school girls bonding together thru knitting. Because this is the 3rd book in the series, I would have probably enjoyed it more if I had read the other 2 but the author did a very good job of bringing the reader up to date on the characters. A good YA read.This review was written for Connie's Book Reviews and More on Facebook."
4,The real racial history of many Americans,"This important contribution to a long-overlooked subject is marred by a number of minor, but annoying factual errors. For example, Capt. John Smith used a *revolver* to order the people of Jamestown to work. That said, there are few other sources of information that address this issue, and if for his courage alone, Katz deserves our thanks"
5,"Sad, brilliant and without peer.","Between the Regal Sessions and these Atlantic Recordings, Blind Willie McTell was at the height of his powers. Although some might disagree, McTell was, I think, the best blues interpretivist of his era. McTell could take an old chestnut like ""Last Dime Blues"" and rework it into his own signature material. With just a simple break in his voice McTell can bring you to tears.If you are a fan of American Roots music, you owe it to yourself to purchase these Atlantic Sessions. This recording is an essential in any blues lover's collection and may possibly be the best country blues recording of all time."
1,Adesso Bad experience poor warranty,Purchase two first one received only worked for 24 week. had to pay 12.50 shipping to get it replace took 3 weeks had to buy 2 keyboard so i have one working until the one under warranty was return .....Bad experience
1,what a disappointment,"I read all the reviews and was so excited to relax with this dvd....it is broken down into 3 different sections, the first has some really horrible classical music (they should have used something new age that actually fit with the ocean waves) and it plays over the top of the visuals...so no soft music with the ocean in the background. ugh. the second one is natural sounds, but the backgrounds are all reds and oranges that are not soothing visually...and only a tiny bit of afternoon blues before going back to vibrant reds again. the final one is a static shot that is actually okay, it just plays on a continuous loop, but at least it is blue skies and ocean waves. Really wish I hadn't spent the money. I bought 2 others by him, I hope they are better..."
5,a rebuilders manual,book was basic well illustrated and informative. i have an older engine so i needed a manual that covered my engine.
2,Glaring Oversight!,"I wanted to rebuild my sbc and have used David Vizard books before so went for it. I read all the way through and thought I was ready for the undertaking but found, when I knew more of what need to be done, that there is absolutely no instruction on how to measure what main and rod bearing sizes are needed. I mean that's a pretty big oversight. Maybe they didn't have plastigage back then so it was just best to ask a machine shop to mic it and tell you? Either way, wish it had been at least mentioned this needs to be done and not just go with the stock size and keep your fingers crossed."
3,A Good Schock,"This was a good movie. This was a good mystery. This was not an ""In your face. I am gay. Hear me roar"" movie. Chad Allen did an excellent, believable job. Those of the opposing view were not demonized. Actually they were humanized, which is rare for Hollywood, as most people who do not share the ""pro-gay"" view are characterized as religious nuts, zealots, freaks or malicious homophobes. There was something missing though that would not allow this to be a "" major motion picture movie"". It felt more like a weekly series. And a good one it would be. With the exception of one character, the actors did a great job of playing ""gay"" , but not over doing it. Often when straight actors play gay, they force the character and over compensate. Not so in this mystery. Yes, this movie has an agenda, but I enjoyed the action, mystery and plot so much that the agenda was secondary. A good movie."
5,great novel,First time reading a novel by this author and I will be checking out the rest of his works. Heartbreaking story and relevant to these times
4,Liked it,A good read into insight into priests and people in very tough conditons. Cannot even imagine what it means to not be able to practice my faith and hope I never have to.
2,"Boring, slow, awful book","I had to read this book for book club, and I was not really a fan. I liked it better than our first book, but that is not saying much, because I hated our first book. The characters are described really well, you can truly picture them, and the images you create are disgusting. All of the characters are toothless and some are diseased. The book itself, I found very boring. I did not like the ending, and I was just glad it was over. The entire book is very depressing. I am not religious, and definitely and not Catholic, which may have helped me like the book, but I doubt it.VERDICTI don't recommend this for anyone. :(see more of my reviews at kaitlinmichelle.com"
1,Unusable,We ordered this online and when we tried to program it for our TV/DVD/VCR combo were not able to get it to don anything. I finally found the manufacturers web site and read through the FAQ section. Sorry but the device doesn't work with DVD/VCR combos. Worthless. We will send it back but certainly can not recommend it.
2,Disappointed,"I'm very sorry, but the universal remote control was not what I expected.Like, when I want to turn on my tv. the vcr came on and visa versa. But the company was very helpful and quick to let me send it back and refunded me my money.Very pleased about the service,thanks.Regards Yoka van Dijk."
1,wrong item,Fluidmaster packed the wrong item in the right package. I was sent the wrong item 3 times. I am promised a refund.
3,Great Ab workout; the rest is probably out dated,"I tried the abs portion of this program years ago and think that that portion deserves 5 stars alone, however the rest of the DVD is probaby a bit dated. Pat Wade has, in my opinion, an amazing build in this. My abs really appreciated the abs workout. To me, it was very effective. The rest, not so much."
5,Rising Above Belam,"Do not be fooled, this album is only a taster for the master, Jah, to explode your musical appreciation into seeking out his latest works. RAB is your opportunity to feel where the journey begins, where it takes you needs no comment....."
4,Still great...,"After all these years, I still think this is a wonderful album. Actually, just ""Visions of You"" with Sinead O'Connor's legendary vocals is reason enough to buy this album. I have to admit however that I do skip some tracks, I do not find the whole album equally enjoyable, therefore 4 instead of 5 stars. However Jah Wobble's unique sound is fully worth it."
5,So Far So Good,"When I found this heating pad, I was excited to find one that wasn't too big or too small, but was also a good price. So far this one has worked well. I can even fold it and it doesn't lose heat. I'd definitely recommend this product."
1,BEWARE!!! THIS IS JUNK!!!,I purchased one which failed after 3 weeks of simple use. I exchanged it for another which failed a week after the return window. Bummer!
3,Great Gift,"I got this heating pad for my girlfriend and she absolutely loves it. She says it never gets too warm, and just relaxes her. Have never used it personally."
2,stopped working after 3 months,"Was nice for 3 months. Auto shut off is a nice feature, Hot setting was hot enough."
1,"A sad, sad departure for CIV","Thirteen Day Vaction is complete JUNK. It is the worst possible kind of pop-punk. Sappy, ridiculous lyrics with a bland and over-produced sound. This album is no different than anything Good Charlotte has put out. There is no edge or grit present at any level.It is mind boggling to me that this could be the same band that put out Set Your Goals. It's more than apparent that CIV was shooting for mainstream acceptance, but why fall so far from the tree? Couldn't there have been some sort of middle ground? Songs like ""Big Girl"" and ""Secondhand Superstar"" are gag worthy! But really, those two songs alone can't sum up the overall wretched vibe Thirteen Day Vacation gives.It's really sad that a band with so much potential had to go out with a sissy-rock album like this."
1,Bad Album,"I will admit to having never heard a song off of this album. Set Your Goals was just plain awesome. I saw the band on the warped tour the summer of 98 when this album came out, and they didn't play a single song off of 13 days. It seemed like a pretty good sign that the record was garbage."
3,"ok, too concerned with image","Karen O is cool and all, but she really never shows her ability to do anything but be cooler than you, except for the song Maps, and a few other places. the drums and guitar are stellar, but karen is too concerned with her image and living up to the bands mountain of hype most of the time. But Maps is an amazing song. Give it a listen"
4,"Heavy load of rock, but interesting.","When I first listened to the album, it sounded like one of those heavy metal bands where the singer is going crazy and isn't making real music. But after a couple of times listening through, certain songs are starting to grow on me and I enjoy the music on this album more. The standouts on this album include, ""Rich"" (love the riff that drives the song), ""Date with the Night"" (catchy beat, my style of music), ""Maps"" (alternative rock sound that could make this song a hit), and ""Y Control"" (cool background noise, rhythym makes you want to jump). I would reccommend this album to anyone who likes heavy-metal, punk rock, or garage revival music. The songs can sound very cool."
2,No No No Yeah Yeah Yeahs,"It's not my intention to write a review here and have it be completely ripped to smithereens. I just think that with a single out as creative and flowy (and as ""Pretenders-esque"") as Maps, the whole CD should've reflected that. The rest of the CD is just screaming and unsettling. And I am a fan of punk rock. I was surprised that the Yeah Yeah Yeahs are categorized with The Strokes and The White Stripes. Maybe they just need some more practice? This CD is a perfect example of a one-hit-wonder.If you're considering buying the CD after hearing Maps, listen to a some of their other stuff before you buy it. If I could take it back to the store, I would. I'd have been just as happy buying Maps for 99 cents off of the Apple mp3 store."
1,"Wow, this is bad","I purchased this cd because of its cheap price and because of the onslaught of press about how ""great"" the band was. Spin Magazine hailed them as ""magnificent"". The fact is that this cd just isn't that good. I don't mind raw sounding garage rock (the new Libertines album is fantastic) but this band is just an embarassment to all the great unsigned bands out there. The songs just aren't there at all. The vocalist is very annoying (I'd much prefer Dani Filth from COF before this banshee) and the music is boring and uninteresting. This is the worst cd purchase I have ever made. For a good, fresh new garage band, check out the Libertines."
2,The ZZZZZZ album: another media sweet garage band,"I really wanted to like this band, but good taste prohibits me from doing so. maybe I'm going to be dismissing them because their sound is tired, lackluster, and the foundation of so many ""new york"" look-at-me-i'm-looking-at-my-shoes lo-fi trash-indie bands that fill up the scene today that were already copying a trashy old-school sound. Or maybe it's the almost siouxie and the banshees vocals minus any charisma or feeling in the voice. And I admit to having had a five-minute affinity for the recently released single 'maps', but even that doesn't give staying power. It so wants to rock, but it's like the band members are pushing out a half-asleep rehersal.two stars for catching my interest, but no more for letting me down. I think if these peeps take some uppers and hire a good producer, we might get somewhere."
2,"Unimpressive, overproduced thud-rock","I bet this band is a gas live, and they do make a pretty vicious noise for a trio, the kind that you can usually rely on Touch and Go Records to supply. But this record just doesn't stick, the Pretenderesque vocals totally extraneous to the overall sound, and polishing the antagonism of the band's attack with pristine production makes no sense. You'll play it once or twice and wonder why you bought it in 5 years."
3,When you over-hype a scene...,"...Mediocre albums like this are hailed as masterpieces that they obviously aren't. Karen O's screeches, moans, and catcalls sound more calculated than spontaneous, and the songs are often more annoying (See ""Tick"") than invigorating. I can see how some people would dig this, but it feels like too much fluff and not enough meat for me."
4,Great potential....,"Yes, the media hyped them up to no end (the s/t EP *is* fantastic, though). Yes, they sound just like a million other rock bands, but so do a million other rock bands. Yes, no doubt there's a bit of pretention and posing too, but anyone remember a little ditty called ""Revolution 9"" by a group of Liverpudians?If you're looking for an album that's perfect for zooming down the highway at 90 miles an hour, a way to annoy your neighbors without even playing it very loud, a great excuse to airdrum/airguitar, or you want blow out your eardrums in ecstasy, it's hard to top this album. It's not going to change the world, but it does rock. It'll be interesting to see where they go next."
3,Good But Not Great,"Their sleazy lyrics would do Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley proud, but overall, this is one punk band with not a whole lot to say. Yeah Yeah Yeahs are best taken in smaller doses, as stretched out over an entire album, they get to sound pretty damn monotonous. Nothing as great as ""Our Time"" here, but ""Maps"" is one of the sweetest punk songs ever written."
1,"rating: -1,000 stars",i wouldnt waste a BLANK cd copying this garbage...the lead singer sounds like shes all doped up on drugs and being tortured at the same time..how the hell people enjoy this garbage i dont know
4,GREAT RAW ENERGY,"WOW these guys are awesome. Karen O. howls, moans, writhes, and screams through eleven fast paced bursts of energy that don't really sound like anything I've heard before. Sure there can be comparisons to the Strokes, etc. but these guys are in a category all there own. Having no bass player is made up by the drummer beating on his drum kit like he's trying to kill it and it works. Any real music fan should pick this one up."
3,Birthday,"When I hear ""Maps"" I am reminded of the first time I heard the Sugarcubes ""Birthday"".The video for ""Maps"" is simply brilliant.Too bad the rest of the album is not up to the standard of that single."
2,Depressing and Dissapointing,"What happened? I have been SO looking forward to this recording, but it is depressing, lifeless, no spark, and worst of all no fun. It does not sound like Wynona enjoyed most of these classics. What a shame."
5,HEAR HER - SEE HER -- GREAT ALBUM SAYS A FAN!,"OK, I did this backwards. I saw her for the first time ""LIVE"" on the second stop of her ""2007 Christmas Classic Tour"" -- and knew the basics about Wynonna's music catalog. I knew ""the hits"", and of course the great story of her rise to fame.BUT ... when I heard her voice about 3 weeks ago ""live"" in concert ...A simple stage set.A simple music backdrop.A roaring yet delicate voice ... was unbelievable!The concert was all about her voice as an instrument.""I Want to Know What Love Is"" brought the house down when slotted against Christmas classics.The album is a pure joy, in the same approach (of course, it does not include "" I Want to Know ..."").BUT the music is brilliant. Soft. Musical. Classic Christmas. You can listen to just the music or listen as you have dinner, talk, relax.Already one of my favorites. Will be yours too.Signed: A Music Lover and A New Respectful Fan of Wynonna"
5,Just Beautiful,"I saw Wynonna perform ""Ave Maria"" on the View, and thought it was so beautiful I bought the c.d. ""Ave Maria is beautiful, but my very favorite is ""O Come, O Come, Emmanuel"" It really is so beautiful, very touching. I would recommend this CD to anyone who appreciates the finer things in life."
1,This will trap you into thinking that it's good,"Hey S. Zhou, that guy obviously didn't like this album, and you can't understand why, and he creatively made fun of it and it went way over your head obviously. Enough of this king of the South (...), because the nominees are all pop clones that everyone is mentioning! But if you need a real candidate, other than Scarface, try Devin the Dude because he's not afraid to be himself. I think T.I.(whatever that means) could make better music, but he's more content with fitting in and selling more records! So be it."
1,Worst CD ever this ain't No Classic!,I't was a waste of my ten dollars.I't should have been a quarter not even that a penny I wouldnt even pay anything for this waste of CD.
4,Who knew Spanish kids are playing Funk,"There are some terrific gems on this CD. Funky get down and dance music. Stuff that I absolutely have to have in my collection. As with many compilations, there's also stuff that is okay and a few that I punch past. If you're looking for something with a Latin tinge, go elsewhere. This stuff is very American sounding, much like the dance floors of the the mid 70s."
2,"Fun, but too easy...","My husband bought this game for me for Christmas and I really enjoyed playing it until I finished it in 4-5 hours! It was so easy once you got the hang of it. The story is too short...I only had to defeat 2 levels to finish the game. For adults, I would recommend another game, but I'm sure it's more challenging for younger players."
3,A pleasant surprise,"I was a little skeptical about this series. I'm a knitter, not a needleworker, so I wasn't sure I'd be interested in the inner workings of an embroidery shop, even with a mystery thrown in. But the cast of characters was intriguing, and the plot had enough twists and turns to keep any mystery lover enthralled. Not the deepest book I've ever read, but interesting enough to make me want to read more of the series -- and maybe even try a needlepoint project some time!"
5,The first in a promising new series,"I bought this book on a lark--I like mysteries, especially cozies, and I like needlepoint, so the premise of this novel really appealed to me. And I was NOT disappointed! A terrific book, fun to read. I was a bit upset when the master needlewoman was the victim, but what is a murder mystery without a murder? Throughout the entire time I read the book, my fingers were itchin' to stitch! Cannot wait for the next one in the series!"
4,A great get-away book,"This is a great, if somewhat ""fluffy"", book especiall for those that like to read and like to do some type of needlework. It was a great bood to lose yourself in for a few hours - depending on how fast you read!"
5,My Favorite CD,I heard the song Flying on the soundtrack to the TV show Due South. The lyrics and the guitar work captured me. I was impressed enough by this one song that I hunted down this album. It has since become my favorite along with all the other albums by this band.
4,Getting it Right this Time,"Touching and profound. The humor was bright, the sadness deep - but through it all, Dr. Sellers brings the lessons home and provides the blueprint to ""get it right this time."""
5,A good read,"Although the previous reviewer has gone off rather on a tangent with regard to the content of Dawkins' book, I sympathise with her views.Richard Dawkins once said that 'faith' is for ""insecure theists"", when in reality, Dawkins' books are written on the grounds of faith.For me personally, theism provides a better explanation than materialism, but never the less, 'River Out Of Eden' provides a good source for contemporary theories and views of Darwinism and materialism."
2,DVD needed for all Dinosaurs Volumes,"Hi I read some of the reviews for the Dinosaurs Volumes.The show was so short lived. It is a shame.My family got a real treat to see the baby dino hit his dad on the head with the pot, bat or sometimes with a shovel. It was a really fun show.We have some of the VHS, and would really appreciate the DVD version. Anyone out there listening.How much do you want for these DVD's? G0TTA LOVE THEM....Brenda"
5,One of the best rock songs in years.,"I thought rock died by 2000 with the horrible nu-metal garbage that luttered the charts recently. This song from the meistro of Tears For Fears has brought new life to what I think is a dying genre of music. Low Life is a heavy rock song with ambient guitar riffs with techno drums and electronic sound effects and a danceable beat. I missed the great sound of rock music that has been lacking since like 1994. Roland Orzabal amazes me with his incredible music. His former group Tears For Fears is my all-time favorite group.This song is the first single off the Tomcats Screaming Outside. It was a smart choice to release it. It's sad it didn't make a dent on the American charts. If you have this single, go and get the Tomcats Screaming Outside CD. It's incredible."
5,A Real Treasure,"Wow wow wow - I've not seen the movie, but I can't get enough of this music. From the first time I heard this, it was like an old friend. Something I've known all my life and could connect with, requiring no effort at all. Each time I listen to this it seems to reach a little deeper and connect even more than the time before. I'm so glad this got captured for the world to enjoy and savor, and wasn't lost like so much other music has been. A real treasure!"
5,"Relaxing, enjoyable, delightful","Relaxing, enjoyable & delightful music can be found on this CD. We had seen the Buena Vista Social Club on PBS television & really enjoyed the music. When Christmas time came I ordered this CD, we just love the sound."
4,Finally have it...,"After much time pondering, on whether or not to buy it. I decided to. With all of its fame, I thought it would be somethign missing to my collection of over 100 cds from all types of music in Spanish from all countries. I thought most of the songs were so-so at first, sine Cuban music from the countryside is not my favorite. or maybe i shoudl say, it is a bit outdated for my favorites in latin music. I think it is a nice piece of work. Some songs appeal to me a lot, while others do not. In a whole, I think it is nice piece to my collection, and I think they did excellent on the Grammys."
3,3 stars because of Ry Cooder,The CD is excelent and deserves 5 stars but Ry Cooder playing does NOT fit in.
4,Shiva mythology,"Mythological stories, guide to ceremonies, wisdom and endless price of Shiva. Although it was a tough reading, it gave me a much deeper understanding of shaivism. It shows the richness of the hindu traditions in many ways, but especially through all the divine stories, which bear witness to a long evolution of this tradition and the presence of many enlightened beeings in it. If one is not from india, it may seem a little dry, because one has to use ones own fantacy to visualize the sceneries, while someone in india can see the temples etc. in real life."
2,1.5 stars,"what happened to NUFAN? they got old, thats what. In my opinion this CD sucks. its boring, slow, and boring. There is no energy but into it. These guys used to be a good punk band, faster stuff and much better stuff has been made. Do not buy this album, unless you are a hardcore fan, and if you are a hardcore fan, chances are you wont buy it either cause it SUCKS! there is one good song on this CD, ""there will be revenge"" other than that this CD is bad. slow. boring."
2,"At least a weird change, i'm really confused","Although NUFAN is my favourite band i've to say that this new cd is, quite bizarre. I know they are getting older but i still prefer the sound of ""Making Friends"". So, if you're thinking of buying it, first hear it once to get your own opinion. For me the best song in this cd is ""check for a pulse"""
2,not good at all,"I can't believe this is the same band who released albums like Making Friends and Leche Con Carne. No Use have done absolutely nothing new since ""More Betterness"" came out almost 8 years ago. This sounds exactly like ""Hard Rock Bottom"" with the same formulaic hooks, riffs, and vocals. They've totally lost the edginess they used to have, and have settled into a rut of boring recycled music. NUFAN used to be one of the few ""punk"" bands that I liked, because they were different than most of the carbon-copy punk bands that had flooded the scene, but now it seems they've run out of ideas. There's no emotion or feeling anymore, it's as if they're writing these songs to appease the general public and gain radio airplay. I just can't get into this album like I got into their older stuff, who knows, maybe it's just me. If you're looking for something new here, or you're an old school fan, you'll probably be disappointed with this album."
1,"Design Flaw - ""Radio reception error""","This radio should be taken off the market. The other reviewers are absolutely right. It constantly alarms (usually in the middle of the night) with ""Radio Reception Error"" message yet there is nothing in the manual about this. Not a clue as to what the problem might be or how to reset or disable it. You have to unplug the device and remove the batteries to reset it and it comes back again within hours. The customer service was no help. All they said was that I would have to send the radio in to them to have it repaired. A brand new radio just out of the box? I don't think so. It is being returned to Amazon for a refund. Too bad, if I could have just turned that one alarm off or disabled it everything else about this radio worked great."
3,Chilton manual,"I feel better having some specific reference when working on a vehicle. The Chilton manuals offer a fair reference to some repair questions. Book was as I expected, in good shape as advertised. It also arrived very quickly."
1,Dogs are not horses,"I ordered this book as I've always had horses and was impressed that the author fashioned her training model after Monty Roberts the Horse Whisperer. The first thing she tells you to do is totally ignore your dog. Sorry, that wasn't going to happen. I'd rather teach my dog how to interact with me appropriately and highly reinforce them for wanting to interact with me.As a motivational trainer who is always trying to build and maintain a positive relationship with my dogs I quickly realized how damaging her methods can be. They will certainly work with horses and maybe dogs if you keep a large pack of them like she and Cesar do, but if you are an average dog owner who wants a close relationship with your dog/dogs, especially if you compete in any dog sports, I would recommend anything by Dr. Ian Dunbar, Suzanne Clothier, Pam Dennison, Leslie McDevitt, Jean Donaldson, Karen Pryor, Pat Miller, and Dr. Sophia Yin."
3,Pretty basic.,"Writer is to biographical and anecodetal. Information very general, I wish it were more specific. Not bad if you want good background to train your dog."
5,The Dog Listener,Have been reading a wide variety of texts on raising a new puppy and have been looking for a method of training that I could comprehend and have a reasonable chance of implementing. As a result have bought or been given a wide varieties of texts on the subject.Jan Fennel's book is by the the best read on the topic and offers practical solutions that every adult dog owner should knowThe process should be simple and Jan makes it this way offering hope that given the right approach you can learn to communicate and train a dog in 30 daysSeems unlikely but read this book and I think anyone with the patience and diligence will find a way to communicate and train even the most difficult of dogsI would thoroughly recommend this book to anyone with a dog
2,Not Good,I purchased this item while looking for new colognes. i thought these would be hard to find and this had a few together. one of the bottles was open and had leaked all inside the package and it all smelled like that certain cologne. the whole set itself was really poor quality. it looks nice in the picture but i found it seemed very old and expired and the scents were really bad. it was like buying some dusty cologne from goodwill or something. the Le Roy Soleil Dali scent was actually kind of nice but considering the cost of the whole set its one ridiculously overpriced sample. i do not recommend at all.
2,doesn't fit well,I ordered a large and it fit more like a medium. The material wasn't very comfortable either. I would not order the shirt again.
5,"Cher, Cher, and Cher!","An EXCELLENT CD. Every fan of Cher should own one. I have a ton of Cher CD's, but you can never have too many. This CD, much like many live CD's, has edited applause. Which makes sense because you can't have applause over the performer's voice, whether they are talking or singing. It REALLY just won't work out. But this CD is excellent, and I'm not just saying this because I am a HUGE Cher fan. The CD has an assortment of songs from the long and prosperous career of music's best, making the CD even better. Too many artists sing songs only from their newest album and don't pay homage to their first hits that got them where they are today. Cher does that, and, making this CD even better, it really is Cher singing."
3,my search continues,"As a mug, the Timolino 14 oz Amphi Mug is fine. It is comfortable to hold and the lid doesn't dribble. I've been looking for an insulated mug that isn't styled for a car cup holder because they tip pretty easy with their tall skinny design and I want something stable to pour my morning coffee in and leave on my nightstand while I hit ""snooze"" on the alarm for a while. After using this one for a few weeks, the downside I've found is that my coffee doesn't stay as hot as expected. I was using a 20 oz mug before and it is probably due to the smaller volume of liquid in the 14 oz, it just doesn't hold the heat as much. Also, to take a drink, the lid requires one hand to hold the mug and another to push the tab open."
1,Horrible,I received the wrong size mug and sent email and returned it - 3 months later still nothing. I don't have time to spend countless hours contacting them and begging for my money back or to get the right size mug.
1,piece of junk,I got disconnect every two mins. Take my advise don't buy this product.. if you want i give to u for free..
1,AVOID LIKE THE PAGUE!!! CRASHED my Windows XP,"I installed drivers for MA111 USB adapter on my desktop, as directed by Netgear technical support. Unfortunately this install caused my OS to crash and I am unable to boot up my PC anymore. Each time I try to boot it prompts me to boot in one of XP's boot modes and each mode takes me to the blue screen and causes my PC to restart every time.I am surprised and disappointed that being such a reputed company, Netgear can manufacture such a raw product that can cause such significant damages.Save yourself from a potentially similar situation --- AVOID this product!!!"
1,THIS DEVICE ALWAYS PISSES ME OFF,"When i first got this product, i followed the manual word for word. the result; my computer kept coming up with a blue screen that told me that a device driver was ""potentialy corrupt or improperly installed"". IF YOU WANT A WIRELESS ADAPTER GET THE Netgear MA101 802.11b Wireless USB Adapter. I HAVE ONE OF THESE HOOKED UP TO ANOTHER COMPUTER IN MY HOUSE AND IT WORKS GREAT!!! I GOT IT IN A COMBO PACKAGE AT COSTCO FOR ONLY ABOUT $50 (THE BEST PRICE AROUND). ANYWAY, IT IS DEFINITELY A FIVE STAR PRODUCT. ALTHOUGH IT MAY BE A BIT BIGGER, IT IS WORTH IT (NOT GETTING YOUR COMPUTER F**KED UP). IT ONLY COSTS A FEW BUCKS MORE (AT SOME PLACES THEY ARE THE SAME PRICE)."
1,this is a junk,"This thing is a junk. I got a new p4 2.4 ghz and this network adapter spoiled my computer. I dunno how this product is still there in market. The product is full of bugs. First it crashed my windows XP pro OS and wouldnt install. Then when i removed the driver software and tried windows installation my computer started to reboot as soon as I insert the adapter in the USB. The adapter has now spoiled my computer, it was so nice before now its running slow. And my computer never used to hang and now it has begun to hang. I feel so bad at buying this product. Please i suggest that those who are buying it , dont do so..... this thing cannot install in the computer. mine is a new one also.This product is not worth it."
3,Blah,"I bought the Netgear 814 router and this MA111 USB device at the same time. Router works great. When I first installed the MA111 it worked great. Plug and Play. Later however the green LED just kept blinking and wouldn't connect when the computer was rebooted. I couldn't even get into the configuration utility. After much trial and error I came up with a solution. I hate to go to into the Networking folder, disable the device, enable it, then go to the configuration utility. In the utility I changed the trasmit rate to something else hit OK. Instantly it connected and everything worked great.However after you reboot you have to do this process each and every time. It doesn't automatically connect on its own. What a pain to get it started. Running Windows 2000 Pro in case anyone is wondering."
2,Does not work with non-SE Windows 98!,"Despite the fact that the description says it works with Windows 98, I spent half a day messing with it, only to eventually be told by Netgear tech support that it does NOT work with Windows 98, only with Windows 98 Second Edition. It would be nice if the description or documentation had mentioned this so I didn't waste hours of my life fiddling with it."
1,Terrible. Terrible.,"I purchased the MA111 v1 brand new. It didn't work. I tried troubleshooting and downloading the new drivers. It still didn't work.I tried contacting NetGear ""24/7"" customer service but the line was always busy. When I finally got through they weren't much help.My advice, avoid this headache and go with another brand."
4,Great Little bridge adapter,"This little adapter is great. I use it to connect my Tivo to my network, thus freeing up my telephone line from updates."
3,Not His best,"This CD was a little boring, and yes, repetitive. I like glass but there were no themes that really stood out, the whole thing was sort of gray."
1,Heating Pad died after 9 months,"Loved this pad, used it a few times a month. Bought it in July, it died in May.Now trying to get Amazon to refund my money.Customer beware."
2,Not for back or shoulder pain!,"I purchased this product for lower back pain because I thought the shape of the heating pad would work well. But after receiving it learned it was meant to be to place on top of painful area only. Leaning against it creates too much heat very quickly even on the lowest setting. If you need back pain relief, search heated lumbar support, also available on Amazon."
2,heating pad,"the heating pad just does not get hot enough. I do like the shape and stitching, it doesn't get wrinkled."
2,Oversimplified,"I have other titles in the ""Very Short Introduction"" series and have taught astronomy in community college for many years. Using Amazon's ""Look Inside"" feature I found that the breezy start to this book, full of rhetorical questions, lets the reader know immediately they are in for a lowbrow style. But when the author says on page 2 that astronomy is not an experimental science he betrays short-sightedness that's too hard to get over.I won't be buying this book. I have better options."
4,A definitive account of the battle,"Second World War Company Commander Charles B. MacDonald's book is a painstaking recreation of Hitler's Ardennes Offensive. MacDonald's personal experiences during the Battle, as well as his detailed research and interviews, adds another dimension to this book which first landed on booksellers' shelves in the mid 1980's. About the only shortcoming are that the maps contained in the book are a bit too infrequent and a reader would likely need to keep a separate and detailed scaled map of the Ardennes nearby in order to keep track of the action."
5,Dad in WWII,Great service from seller this book is about the 2nd division in WWII. It is a detailed account of each company.
4,Just what I needed,"They came quickly. Although I have not used all of them, the ones that are in service have worked just fine.Very satisfied"
2,Prepare to buy more,I purchased the PetSafe anti-bark collar because its price seems more reasonable than other collars. I now learn that the collar is just the start to get customers committed. These batteries have a super short life-span. I have already gone through 4 batteries and this purchase was to buy 2 more. A single battery lasts less than a week of continuous wear. It might be better to get a different collar.
1,All dead,I bought the Pet Safe collar and it came with the RFA-67[[ASIN:B0009811TW PetSafe 6-Volt Lithium Battery that only lasted about a week. I also bought two packs of two each replacement batteries each and everyone died about one minute after installing them. How can they call them NEW! The should show the expiration date.[[ASIN:B0009811TW PetSafe 6-Volt Lithium Battery (2 Batteries per Pack)]]
1,didnt last,The batters dont last long at all. the first one was dead within a couple hours the first day. The other lasted maybe an hour longer then the first.I took them out of the colar when not in use. The batters were priced way to good to be true.
1,NOT FOR PETTAG BARK COLLARS!,These may very well be fine batteries. However this ONE STAR review is for Amazon.com for continuing to link totally unrelated battery set with the Pettag bark collar:Pettag Large over 25# Dog Sonic & Vibration No-Bark CollarRight there at the bottom of every page are these PetSafe 6 Volt Lithium replacement batteries. DON'T FALL FOR IT. Of course Amazon will deny any responsibility and point out over and over that they are NOT responsible for compatibility of products matched at the bottom of the product pages. This is the second time I've been burned like this... Guess I'm an idiot.
2,Not for all control collars,"Amazon has this in a discount combination with the PetSafe Large Dog Control Collar. But it used different batteries. And because they are flagged as containing a flammable material, they can't be returned. Buyer beware."
2,Wrong Product,I am sure the batteries are fine but these are replacement batteries that Amazon recommended for a dog training collar that I bought. Unfortunately they are the wrong batteries.
5,PetSafe batteries,"The batteries are long lasting. They are water resistant, easy to install and remove from the bark collar.they stay securely in the collar."
1,Dead batteries,"I ordered batteries for my dog's training collar. I was happy that they arrived in short order but was totally DIS-satisfied to discover that the batteries were deader than a hammer. Perhaps dated, expendable products are not the safest things to be purchasing on Amazon.com... Just my opinion on this round."
1,Did not order.,"I was about to order this product on Amazon and then I looked at all the reviews. I did a search for the battery on line and found it at Walmart for $6.88, free shipping! Great deal. The ones on the walmart website didn't have any negative feedback either. I hope this helps anyone looking to order it."
1,Poor Batteries,"I received a two pack of batteries and the batteries don't last more than a week in my dogs barking collar. These are a waste of money, but i am not pleased with the performance on the dog collar neither."
1,Doesn't fit the bark collar,I ordered the collar and 6 volt batteries together. The problem-the collar takes two 3volt batteries.
1,Not Necessary,"This item was matched with the bark collar and made it seem that it would be needed, however when we received the products these batteries don't even work w/ that particular bark collar."
1,wrong product advertized on amazon,"i ordered the trainin collar and the 2 batterys were offered with the collar. but they are not the correct battery, the collar i ordered takes 2 cr2032 batteries."
5,barking collar batteries,Great product better price than at the store lasts a long time I recommend it very satisfied. a A a a a a a
5,Petsafe 6-Volt Lithium Battery (2 batteries/pack),The shipping on this product was very fast. This is the best buy I have seen for these batteries in a long time. These batteries are used for invisible dog fences and are a really great product. They last several months before needing to replace them. Purchasing through Amazon you really can save and that is always a positive.
1,They sent the wrong one,"They sent the wrong one to me, it didn't even go with the item. I recommend this to no one."
2,Wrong battery!,"I ordered this battery in combination with a collar on the recommendation of Amazon. I love the collar. The battery, however, is the wrong size so I can't use it."
3,poor shipping!,"although I paid for faster delivery, they did not ship till 3-4 days after the order was sent."
4,Petsafe batteries...,I love our Petsafe wireless fence system for the most part. My only hesitation is with the fact that from time to time the collar will beep without a cause that I can recognize. I'm never sure if it's a weak battery or a signal interruption of some type. It does keep our dog in our yard. Much cheaper than building a fence.
4,Very helpful book,"I found this book very useful for shading and drawing various parts of the body. I also liked the section on hands, because I'm not very good at drawing them. The section on drawing backs was also helpful. by the way, I AM a girl, and yes I found every aspect of this book helpful in some way or another. I don't believe that the other female reviewers I noticed had a very good idea of how much you can learn from this book..."
3,"Simple, yet useful.","Great for beginners and basic games.If you plan to use a lot of optional rules, you might want to make your own charactor sheets, rather than use the manufactured kind.I recommend it to any beginning D&D gamers."
2,Not worth it!,"This book is not what I expected. First part of the book is for beginners, and most of the book deals with domino.action, which any serious developer wouldn't consider using.If you rip almost 150 pages of the book, you could get a very good reference about Domino Commands.Even the photos look like something a 10 year old made in an hour or two.Where's the Domino book we all want?"
2,Better than Up but that's not much.,"Like a lot of REM fans, I am sad to see that the band seems completely disinterested in creating rock songs anymore. There is a beauty to many of the songs on AOS, but I cannot help myself from pointing my mouse to something more interesting in my iTunes library.This record is much better than Up and more consistent than Reveal, but I find Reveal's gems to be more interesting that the songs on this album. Aside from Ascent of Man, I don't think there's anything too memorable on this cd.My friend Seaweed made the comment that REM has produced a number of great songs since Automatic for the People; the problem is that they've produced five albums since then, so the great ones have been drowned out by all the mediocre stuff. I tend to agree. There is some good stuff on AOS, just as Reveal, Up, New Adventures, and Monster had some good songs, but there has been more misses that hits.All in all, these guys are slowly putting me to sleep."
3,Dissapointed long time fan here,"Around the Sun (this album) and Up are R.E.M.'s two worst albums in my opinion. As a long time fan, I am quite dissapointed with this album and I maintain that the band's music has deteriorated ever since Bill Berry (the drummer) left the band.That said, there are 2 great songs on this album; Leaving New York and The Outsiders. There are a few other listenable ones and a few totally non listenable ones. In fact, a few cuts are not even album worthy.Also, I hate the packaging the album came in (just a cardboard booklet)."
1,rem really revealed,"rem is probably the most overrated rock band ever. I thought they were awful when most people especially critics had their noses up thier arses and were praising ""mumble"" as the greatest thing ever. When the hype is so far beyond the actual worth the descent is bound to be painful. I don't see how they can get much worse than this but I guess we will see unless they do the smart thing and fold. YUK!"
2,Up and Down,"This album, to me, is painfully reminiscent of UP, as far as a listening experience goes-Overly moody, musically flat songs that have too much Stipe, too little Buck. Reveal had more life to it than either Up or Around the Sun and seemed to have more inspired arrangements. REM is at its best with louder, richer layers of music than the introspective piano tinkling meanderings that dominate this one.A lamb without a rack?(Stipe needs to do an album with Adam Duritz from Counting Crows, and title it: BLAH...(Bad Lyricists Anonymous Here))"
2,Revisited This Recently,"(After years of forward progress (With the exception of Up) some signs of aging finally show here. There's nothing awful here. There's just nothing memorable. Hopefully, the next release will show this was a fluke.)I wrote that awhile back, but have been listening to this again recently. It's really not as average as I originally thought. ""Leaving New York"" is a really good song, and ""Electron Blue"" and ""I Wanted To Be Wrong"" really caught my ear this time. Overall I'd upgrade it to 3 stars but Amazon wouldn't let me."
2,"Should be called, ""Out of Tune""","And I thought my wife sang out of tune. Whoever started the word-of-mouth that this was REM's best album since Automatic for the People must have worked for a PR firm. Half is unlistenable, and I've enjoyed a lot of REM's recent work more than other fans. Even the ""hit"" The Outsiders sounds like two different songs spliced together. Save your money."
2,So dull I can't listen,"R.E.M. delivered classic alternative rock with ""Life's Rich Pageant"" and ""Document"" in the mid-to-late 1980's followed by two expertly crafted pop albums ""Out of Time"" and ""Automatic for the People"" in the early 1990's. Early albums such as ""Murmur"" are also considered a classic. Since ""Automatic"" this band (for reasons I don't know) has hit the skids with very average music from ""Monster"" in 1994 to ""Reveal"" in 2001. The albums are OK but lack the clever, hook-oriented 1960's rock or groove that made R.E.M. famous and in my view the greatest American band of the modern (music) era. ""Around The Sun"" has one brilliant moment...the single ""Leaving New York"" one of R.E.M.'s greatest singles. But the rest of the album is flat. I can't even listen to these songs they're so dull. I absolutely love the band-always will-but this album is awful (and the sales figures are going to show it)."
3,That White Suit,"Heard enough of this album to know it was not worth buying. The lyrics are cringe worthy and the songs plod - plus, the ode to ""Bush is a prat"" is very very weak for such a politically intelligent band.I recently saw REM play in Manchester and it was a great gig. Against their older songs, from Lifes Rich Pageant to Automatic, songs from this new album are increbibly out of place on a stage of such brilliance.This poor musical form is oddly reflected in Michael Stipes wardrobe of late, white suit on the cover to blue on stage and I couldn't help but feel the suit was wearing him. Awkwardly jiving on stage.REM - MIA"
4,A nice release but NOT vintage R.E.M.,"Those of you expecting a return to roots, a la U2's 'All That You Can't Leave Behind', will be disappointed. This is a sound release and does take a bit getting used, but it does grow on you. It's a nice addition to your R.E.M. collection but is more along the lines of 'Automatic for the People' than 'Document' or 'Life's Rich Pageant'. Contrary to what many reviews here might indicate, you won't be disappointed with this entry from one of THE best alternative bands of all time."
2,R.E.M. does nothing and somehow calls it an album,"The weakness of an album like ""Around the Sun"" doesn't lie in the fact that the songs are a little on the slow and quiet side. You can make a decent slow and quiet album, in fact R.E.M. already did with ""Up."" No, the problem with ""Around the Sun"" is that the material is weak.Michael Stipe has a harder time than ever coming up with vocal melodies and Peter Buck just doesn't sound very interested. If a song isn't necessarily awkward, as is the case with the first single ""Leaving New York,"" then it's the musical equivalent of blank, white paper, barely registering as anything resembling stirring music.It's no wonder this is the last R.E.M. album produced by Pat McCarthy. He steered the band right into a brick wall with this one. Weak songs coupled with a yawner of a production job just doesn't yield many dividends over repeated listens. At least it didn't with me."
1,Not very good glue,I wanted to use a strong 2 part epoxy for making jewelry... this glue is not meant for that.It may be strong but it cannot handle any kind of shock or force... items pop right off.
2,Pacific Chai Vanilla Chai Latte Decaf,This Chai is very strongly flavored. It is almost like hot chocolate. I don't know if I really like it. It seems to be that it needs more milk or something to dilute the intense flavor.
3,Sage,"This is just a heads up on the sage sheets. I may be out of touch with my color recognition, but the picture of the sage sheets is definitely different from the actual color of the sage sheets.I was naive and assumed the picture represented actual product. Sage is very light green, almost pea like. Single men beware!P.S. I have no issue with the quality of the sheets. They are actually pretty nice."
2,Scratchy - Awful Color,"Even after several washings these sheets are stiff and scratchy. And, as another reviewer pointed out, the sage color is a very light, unattracive green. It, is true, however that they don't wrinkle."
4,reasonable price,"This book was needed for an independent study class-a bit heavy but decent with introductions. Good value for the price.If you need excellent annotations and introductions, try another."
3,"Great text, poor binding","Though I admire the aims of The Oxford Shakespeare's editors and enjoy their text thoroughly, I am sorely disappointed by the binding on the present edition. It is not thoroughly sewn, but rather glued. Leaving the book open for extended periods of time (as in reading) results in splitting. The cover is unusually light and generally flimsy, succumbing easily to nicks and dents. For newcomers to Shakespeare, it is wholly impractical, as the glossary of archaic words is so insufficient it would best be left out completely. For general reading, go with Norton or Riverside. For individual editions, the Signet editions are probably penultimate to Folger library, the latter being notable for detailed summaries, notes, and supplimentary materials."
5,No le hagan caso a Roberto Macias.,Para una persona que lee mucho este libro es un recordatorio muy interesante y muy bien redactado. Para la persona que no lee mucho es un libro con muchos temas del cual podran sacar algun area de interes. EL objetivo: dar una repasada general a los puntos mas importantes de la historia (Tal vez un poco germanizada). Otro punto muy importante es la cronologia: pocos libros hacen un esfuerzo por presentar tablas cronologicas para orientar al lector y entender mejor los sucesos historicos atravez de varios eventos en diferentes lugares. No hay que olvidar que la geografia es la madre de la historia y el tiempo es el padre. Les recomiendo este libro y no le hagan caso al comentario del Sr. Macias.
4,Great reference for those who tinker with Johnson / Evinrude motors,"I have used this as a reference for tune-ups; as well as to assist in repair of fuel pump, carb, water pump, & other outboard issues... has been loaned out a few times in the neighborhood as well. Overall, a great book. If you REALLY need to get serious, a model specific shop manual may be in order."
5,Felicity Potter,"I learned Swedish on a whim, but one of my greatest joys is that I can read Brothers Lionheart in the language it was written in. I can't say enough about this book. By far the best Astrid Lindgren book I have read in English or Swedish."
5,a great and emotional rollercoaster.,"This book is about death. Well, life after death. It's a about two brothers who dies at young age. They get reunioned after death. This book is about the GREAT adventure it turns out to be. As usual Astrid Lindgren balances on the edge of your fantasy and imagination. The story contains it all, adventure, humour, tradgedy. Everything explained in a for kids comprehendable way. I love the book, and I've seen the great film and TV-series. Do your best to get this one. It's a CLASSIC."
2,maybe bad luck maybe bad quality,"I bought two for my bike. One was good when I had a flat tire, but the other did not last long-only two days! It suddenly got blown. I almost had a big accident. It maybe came from my bad luck or maybe from its unreliable system of sustaining its quality. At this time I should find other brand for my flat tire."
2,It was good while it lasted...............,"Purchased this TV in late 2004, and a year and a half later, it doesn't turn on. Maybe it's me, but I expect more out of my technology. I have to say I'm pretty disappointed. I don't believe I'll be purchasing any Philips products in the future. The price has declined to a point that a repair just does not seem justified. Can any one recommend a good TV manufacturer?"
2,Plane Truth,I found this a more complicated approach than the other book I bought which was an older one authored by Jimmy Ballard.
1,"One Plane, Two Plane, Insane","This book is just another one in a series of similar golf ""instruction"" books that do nothing but feed the billion dollar golf industry. It is not wonder that the average handicap hasn't gone down in 30 years even with manicured greens, state of the art instruction and better equipment. This book takes the swing apart and separates it into a two plane swing and a one plane swing. It us up to the reader to figure out which one to use. I can bet that many readers will vacilate in indecision. There are just too many things that Hardy has the reader think about even in the so called ""easier"" one plane swing.It is human nature to take a watch apart to see what makes it tick, but taking a swing apart is foolish. It is like trying to draw a circle in parts. I often wonder at the simplicity of children. They look at things as a whole and do not analyze. A good lesson for all golfers."
5,This is a great album!,"My two favorite songs on this album are ""Sweet Harmony"" & ""Dream On"", I originally had this on a single then had to by the cd & it's great. I would recommend this album to anyone. The music is dream like & the lyrics are flowing. I just wish that this band was more popular in the US. Unfortunately really great music always gets passed over for what's popular."
3,no subtitles,i would have liked it better if it had closed captions when i watched the movie but still a good movie
2,poor quality,I am a cocker spaniel breeder and do my own grooming. I bought this blade because it was cheaper. Save your money and buy the Oster Brand for a few dollars more.
5,Hensley's Trade Secrets and Formulas,"There is information in this book that, over the years, has been forgotten or one is not sure that all the ingredients are included in the formula. I purchased this as a Christmas present for my boyfriend. So, as of today, he has no clue as to what he is getting but had a strong desire to obtain a copy of this book. I am positive that he will love it when he opens the package."
1,These left overs are past their used by date,"As an avid Futurama fan I was eagerly awaiting this film in the hope that Futurama, like Family Guy, one of my favorite shows was about to be gloriously resurrected.Boy was I disappointed. This film is a cash in of the worst kind. The wit, humor, and subtle references of the original series was completely missing. All you get is a series of clichéd appearances by all the old characters loosely connected with a re-hashed plot.Save your money. Enjoy the original, forget about this cash in."
4,Great to see them back!,"When I heard a few months back, that they where releasing a Futurama movie, I knew I just had to have it. Boy was it worth the wait, I found myself watching this over and over again. The box art is pretty sweet to. If your like me and own all four box set of the show, this is a MUST OWN. I'm looking forward to the future movie releases of Futurama. BRING THE SHOW BACK TO TV!!!!"
3,Nice idea but...,A great tribute to the show and a treat for the fans. But waaaay too long and everything is in here including the kitchen sink.
5,dat's cool,"I ordered this dvd, and recived it in couple weeks...cheap delivery, high leveled service...pretty cool video)Amazon is the best"
2,Huge disappointment,"It feels like the last episode of Seinfeld combined with the new Star Wars Midichlorians.Which is to say, self-referential humor to jokes that were funny years ago but fall completely flat if you don't remember them... combined with new characters you hate, a plot that's thin, and very little left remaining from the original formula that made you so happy in the first place."
2,Be weary,"This is not the same quality as the Futurama of old. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that they are just warming up for the other DVDs, but this one was disappointing.The movie seems to suffer from the same problem as The Simpsons. There were still some funny jokes, but they weren't topical. Too many of the jokes were just paying lip-service to funny episodes from earlier in the series and didn't add anything to the story. Also, far too many plot twists. I understand that the movie was intended to be split into episodes, but it felt like different people worked on different parts and just tried to stitch them together.I had to turn the movie off a little over an hour through, but I did watch it a second time and I started to feel a little better about it. I still don't think that I'll be watching this movie with anywhere near the frequency I watched the original episodes.Here's hoping the next movies are back on track."
4,Futurama scores big,This was a surprisingly funny movie and is a must have for all Futurama and Groening fans. Be sure to watch the movie a second time with the commentary feature on.
3,Almost There,"This was a bit of a disappointment. It's obvious that the animation team has changed, and it seems that the writing team has changed as well. While it does improve as time goes on, it doesn't seem to capture what the series had going during it later seasons. Hopefully, as the new writers/animators grow more accustomed to the characters the DVD's will improve. I'm still looking forward to the next release."
4,Futurama does it again,This is another great Futurama victory. I really like this series and am amazed that it was canceled. All of the dvds are outstanding
2,uh...,"...this is really bad. In the way that only something that was really good is now bad. The production quality on the visual side is better than ever. But the script or direction or combination of the two, is really lacking. It feels like it was rushed, like they were trying to make a deadline or something. There is a moment or two where it feels like the old Futurama, but the story, the writing and even some of the perfomances feel forced.One of the few good things I can say about this, is that it illustrates the quality of the original shows. And how much effort really goes into something that comes off so effortlessly.I will still buy the upcoming features, as I very much want Futurama to survive. But I hope they can regain their old rythm, or I fear this will be the end."
3,The score is not so big,I expected something more creative but it was just an elaboration of a couple of episodes
1,I waited five years for this?!?,"Alas, perhaps my expectations were too high? I slogged through this, saying ""just wait - it has to get good soon."" The plot would easily fit a twenty-five minute episode, but is stretched so far that it snaps in this feature-length production. The writing lacks the sparkling brilliance I have come to expect and the visual gags lacked power. (Who can forget Bender dropping that brick in the series?) When it was over, I was left with the impression that the whole thing had been slapped together like some last-minute term paper. See it to say you've seen it, and for the special features - but this is no ""Parasites Lost"" or ""War is the H-Word."""
5,Futurama at its best!,"I saw this film last night, a friend of mine works at a video store, and it was one of the funniest movie that I've seen all year! This is the kind of movie that anyone could appreciate, whether you were a fan of the series or not (there are many references to the series that are great for fans of the series). This movie exceeded my expectations, and I would strongly recommend it to anyone who is thinking about seeing it!"
4,Emerging voice of classical crossover,"The artist usually associated with crossover is Sarah Brightman. But Summer's voice is very unique. By this she seperates herself. The songs are cool and mellow, with wonderful arrangements. She is what classical crossover needed. A blend of operetics and vocality to create a new sound. Summer is the first of her kind, a kind that will define classical crossover."
1,Is there a way to put no stars on these reviews?,"The author is an infamous neoconservative. The best way to describe the book is that it's racist, oversimplified, biased, and ignorant. I hope the people who read this book ralize that it will only breed more ignorance and arrogance. Shame on you, Mr. Lewis!As someone who has and worked in the Middle East, as well as studied it, let me recommend The Looming Tower, No God but God, The Shia Revival, and The Great War for Civilisation. Thease are accurate, eye-opening, insights into such a complex topic."
1,doesn't tell whole story,"i'm not an expert on middle-east history, but common sense tells me something is missing here. if, as prof lewis says, the soviets were agressively pursuing policies to extend their influence over the oil-rich arab states, i think it's a safe bet the americans weren't standing idly by. what exactly they did, though, is glossed over. is there something here that doesn't agree with the professor's arguments? lewis does the same with with the colonial period. it's well known that the british adopted a policy of 'divide and conquer' towards their colonies. the aim was to bequeath debilitated states that could be manipulated for britain's continued economic advantage. oil had already been discovered in the middle-east by the time most arab states achieved independence. it's hard to believe the west encouraged genuine independence when so much was at stake. there's obviously much more here than prof lewis is willing to tell us."
1,Not a fair appreciation of islam,"Overall is a rather cold and cruel vision of islam. The author is not simpathetic or understanding of it. He describes its problems in the same way a psychiatrist tries to understand the mind of an ""insane"" person without ever forgeting that the person ""is crazy"". At the end he does not proposes any substantial solution to the conflict. The question is, how can the arab countries and people can be helped from their pain? Have the western countries really offered their sincere and fraternal friendship, trying to trully help improve those countries? The arab people feel that over the history their culture and dignity have been offended through colonialism and then by globalization that threatens their identity and moral values. What can the western countries do to stop this apparent aggraviation, and offer help, cooperation and legitimate friendship?"
1,"Very simplistic, naive view of the middle east","Lewis attributes all of the animosity that the Islamic world has toward the US to this: jealousy and envy. Not only is that incorrect, but it is dangerous.He seems to have become caught up in the Republican praise that has been heeped upon him."
2,Warm and wonderful!,"A warm, wonderful story -- very engaging. The books presents a whole new way of seeing men. A way of understanding them that made me feel better about myself. Plus, gave me some great new tools that I am definitely using."
2,1940's for sure,"I have to agree with ""ren ren"" about this book. That is how I also felt about it. Lots of insight into men, which I will use but it does neglect independant women. Or how about men meeting women half way or understanding them? It seems that the woman is doing all the adjusting.It does hit a little on communication but there needs to be more."
1,Strange...,"I have been called odd before...but I met this man online in an AOL chatroom, preaching with a bot, and then talked to him in person. This guy is in his 40's, I am 16 and spent 9 years in Bible Study.....and all I can say is I know more about scripture than he does. When I read his words, I can't help but get a bad feeling of another suicide cult, because its obvious he really believes what he says, and manages to get a few others to as well."
2,The words of a lunatic.,"In case anyone would like to know, the author of this book frequents AOL Instant Messenger a lot as GoTimothy54. Chatting with him is always good for a laugh."
5,Sound the Alarm,"In a word Brilliant. The Alarm prove that 13 years after their last studio LP they are still a serious contender in this business of Rock n' Roll for a new ""Second Generation"" of audience to experience.""In the Poppyfields"" is a true masterpiece from First track to last & will take you on an emotional rollercoaster from which you won't want to come down. From the anthemic ferocity of ""45 RPM"" to the haunting echoes on ""the Unexplained"", the sheer beauty of the lyrics & the craftsmanship of composition in the music will leave you floored. No doubt is Mike Peters the hardest working man in R & R, but after hearing this album he very well might just change your life....."
2,No Good,"I don't think the authors have any idea who their audience is. Their goal with this book is a mystery to me. This book misses hundreds of educational opportunities in several areas. Mainly, a description of the abnormalities, using anatomical terms, is to me a blatant omission. In head and neck radiology, anatomy is crucial and complex, and the vast majority of cases in this book DO NOT INCLUDE A DESCRIPTION OF THE FINDINGS. Moreover, the follow-up questions don't seem relevant to anyone, including radiology residents, neuroradiology fellows, or neuroradiology staff. This book seems like it was written by an academic ENT physician, who lost his research funding, hated patients, and decided to dabble in head and neck imaging. The authors of this edition are capable of better work, and I look forward to the next edition. Stay away from this one, though."
1,DONT GET THIS BOOK FOR ORAL BOARDS,"This is not a good book for the oral boards. How many cases of sinonasal cancer, thyroid cancer, and hibernomas are on the boards? Maybe this is a good review for a neuroradiology fellow but its way too in depth for a radiology resident. And I did not think the pictures were that good or classic. The same goes for the spine case review. just stick with the brain case review which is excellent."
4,Awesome Game,"This game is absolutely awesome game it has great graphics and sound. The gameplay is great and the missions are so much fun to play with. The only reason i gave it 4 stars was because it is a little easy to beat, i have almost finished the game i have beat two campaigns and almost half way done with the third campaign. I have accomplished this on regular in about 6-8 hours of playing. Luckily there is still hard and harder to beat. This game is really intense and historically accurate with footage before the mission starts giving you the historical background. The AI are also very good and accurate at shooting. I recomend this game and it is well worth the money. Be sure however to check the requirments and make sure you have enough room on your computer for this game which took 6 dics to load.Great Game, Lots of Fun and action"
4,not what i expected,"Not what i expected but still good game thou. First of all no crosshair once u move which make it almost impossible for a rifleman to shoot a smg gunner at close range, second i though this game will get new muliplayer game mode but it use the same as the first game(at lease add the ones in united offensive too),third maps are small not giving snipers a good spot to snipe, and last almost all the time you won't get hit by gernade because of the indicator. Now the good things alsome graphics, its the only things that impress me, i don't think no fps is using these graphics."
3,Fun when it doesn't lock up the system,"This game has an annoying tendency to lock up the sytem when it's booting up. Then, using ctrl-alt-del, it's hard to kill. I've tried killing all my running applications and disabling my virus scans before starting this program and it still locks up. I've been able to play it twice and had five unsuccessful starts. This one will soon be relegated to the back of the shelf, never to be seen again, if I can't make it run consistently. When it works, which has been rare, it's a great game."
4,Buy it,This book was pretty good. It was the first of her books that I read which whetted my appetite for her other books. If you love vampires then you'll like this one.
2,GET THE ORIGINALS -,"For a PG compilation album, stick with ""Shaking the Tree"" by far the better album. The serious Gabriel fan will already have all of the cuts contained on Revisited. Any of Gabriel's solo works is individually a better album than this compilation."
4,Much-maligned but pragmatic,"It's hard to understand how people could have such a problem with this release. It gleans the best tracks from P.G.'s first two albums (plus some that are not so good) and intersperses them in a coherent manner, at a very low price. Plus, the buyer receives an amusing photo in the insert of a totally bald P.G. seated on a city bench, seeming a bit disturbed. You won't get that from the original albums, and this way you do not have to skip ""Down the Dolce Vita"", since that is thankfully not on here."
5,The technique the author used was intriguing and suspenseful,"This novel was very well written and kept me at the edge of my seat for the entire novel. The way the author uses different techniques just leaves you in awe, and wanting more. The storyline is incredibly original and unique. The classic good verse bad mottefe was given a shock and rude awakening. Peter Foster comes home to a dead corpse in which the identity is unknown. Chief inspector Neil Paget and his partner Sgt. John Tregallas are assigned to help unravel this mystery. After some fine police work they come upon the murderer. I would recomend this book to everyone and for a mature age group specifically."
1,waste of money,"If you are more than 12 inches away you can't hear it, does nobody make any quality products anymore?Don't buy this one, it is a waste of money."
4,Oxo timer,"Pleased with this timer. Simple, strong and compact. Ringer not to loud.Has been in use since arrival and appears to have long life span."
1,Goes bad quickly,What is wrong with this stuff? It is only good for like one day and then it tastes rotten! Don't buy it- you'll regret it.
2,"Informative, Out of Date, and Cryptic","This book contains alot of information on how to program a variety of games, from action to sports to roleplaying. Unfortunatly it was written for VB3 using windows 3.11 so it is very dated. The book isn't easy to read and I found my self rereading the same page multiple times and continuasly backing up a few pages to remember what a procedure did. This book is like reading the raw source code for a game (all be it well commented source code) that reading a how to book."
3,Let there be light....bright light!,"I needed a desk lamp to use by my computer and thought this would be great because it had the organizer base.I bought the white one thinking that it was a nice neutral color and would look ""clean"". I plugged it in and it was so bright, I could not see my monitor. I moved it off to the side, but the light was too distracting. I put in a smaller bulb and it still caused a glare on the monitor screen. I don't know if the other colors of this lamp are as bright, or cause such a glare, but I find it not suitable to use near my computer screen. I have placed this on another desk where the brightness is not an issue."
3,Some value,"My daughter (2 1/2) likes this toy very much and it does a lot of different games. The only thing that drives me crazy is that it says over and over ""Push a buttons""!!! It is supposed to be a learning tool, and it has poor grammer."
3,"I love mysteries, but......","besides the cover and blurb on the back that sets up the mysterious mood, I just cannot recommend this book. The master criminal, or maybe just his name, made me snicker. Where's Moriarty when you need him? The real problem with the book was there appeared to be no mystery. Where were the suspects? Where were the spectacular revelations a la Agatha Christie? The book was more like a suspense novel culminating in the inevitable clash between Amelia and the Master Criminal (snicker, snicker)that's foreshadowed on the back cover. If this is any indication of the series, I'll stick with Mr. Peabody and the Way-Back-Machine, but, then, I am just a rambling accountant......"
5,The four time macines,"There are four ways that they could go back in time:1)time matrix 2)Ellimist 3)sario rip and 4)nuclear accident (wich is the true way they go back in time, acording to ANIMORPHS #16 : THE WARNING"
5,What if,"What if the nuclear disaster blows up the plant, rips the Time Matrix out of the ground, sends it flying into the woods and nearly hits Ax in the head. Heh heh heh. Sorta funny in a way. Then they use it to get some morphs for fun."
5,Transistor tester,I love kits. This is a great easy to assemble kit. When finished you have a great little tester. worth the investment.
5,The tablecloth was perfect.,The tablecloth was a perfect fit for the table. I was not able to find this size in the stores where I shop and was delighted to find this tablecloth online. It's a beautiful.
5,Great hip hop.,"I was skeptical picking this up, I wasn't sure what to expect. After listening to it for a few weeks now, this is the best new group I've heard come out for awhile. They just have so many different styles, sometimes Jaymanilla will go from flowing and sounding like Guru to 93' Casual. The production is of high quality, there are probably about 3 songs that I don't like as much as the rest, with the RJD2 produced ""Clock Song"" as my favorite track. The beat and their flow make you feel high, its one of them songs that you can actually feel while listening to it, doesn't happen very often. My only gripe is the length probably, with a couple of interludes it leaves you only half full. I am excited to hear what else these guys can pull off, considering this is a debut for them, their upside is incredible."
4,Solid album,"I first heard Babbletron on Embedded Studios CD I forget the name of it. I even thought Jay Manilla was cRays Walz for a while, they sound similar. I like this album exept for about 2 tracks, that Awkward Conversations one and the song about the bird. By the way Space Tech Bannana Clip uses a sample from good old Space Battleship Yamato aka (Star Blazers) and is also the best song on the album."
5,"Very sad, yet realistic and well-written.","I felt very bad for Sunny, and liked the ending. I wish Dawn could have been more understanding, in this book and later books she seems a little mean. I can't wait to see what happens to Sunny's mother. All in all, this book was terrific, despite being sad. Much better than the Baby-Sitters Club."
5,A wonderful show!,"I always loved Dr. Quinn and I was really disappointed when it was taken off the air. So, naturally, when I saw the DVD's I ordered them.I did start watching the series in mid-second season so a couple of the episodes were new to me (its hard to catch them in order in re-runs!) but the ones I'd seen before were just as good this time through! I loved the first season DVD's and I'm not disappointed in the second installment. Great quality, great shows and no commercials - who could ask for more?"
5,Non-fiction to perfection,"I can't say enough about Mr Ryan's works - his histories read like fiction - in other words, highly readable, interesting and easy to follow. They hold up well despite their age. The true personal stories are woven into the work beautifully but unlike some ""eyewitness"" history books, the overall story is not lost. I have read this book several times and have enjoyed it every time."
5,Followup reading to a very good WWII movie,"Before Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers, there was ""A Bridge Too Far"". Excellent historical account of Operation Market Garden in WWII. This is a movie and a book that I don't get tired of watching or reading."
5,Cornelius Ryan Still Ranks #1,"A recent read of the novel The Commodore, by John LoweThe Commodorehas had the great effect to once again bring me back to this book which I had read three times in years past before reading once again. Having been caught in the Ardennes as a reporter Cornelius Ryan had the feel from the rifleman's perspective and through his voluminous collection of interviews from participants is able to weave the story together from the field level up to the top command level from the guy holding a PIAT against a Tiger to a photo analyst fighting against the powers that be to stop a catastrophe from unfolding. We lost Mr. Ryan too early while working on another book but he has left a group of books and a legacy from which those of us involved in this business in one form or another can benefit."
5,The best war epic of recent times,"Only the phenomenal new WWII novel, The Triumph and the Glory can rival this magnificent book from Cornelius Ryan as a tribute to courage and dedication to a great cause. A Bridge Too Far is a tale of matchless courage and excruciating suspense, the best book written by Cornelius Ryan, and that's saying something. The movie was terrific but the novel is even better."
1,Cedar RND ad,"Your ad gets zero star rating. You give no information as to the the length of the edging. The 7 x 3 number to me states that the logs are 3"" dia x 7 "" long. Is the price for one log, 10 logs (which would then be 30"" length), etc. How does one calculate how many sections one needs to purchase?7x3Cedar RND Log Edging"
5,magnificent,"The whole story is just like it was back in the 60""s. Truely and wonderfully shot in now high def with narration to create this fabulous world war 11 series of actual footage and beautiful music.A super gift for our world war 11 dads and any history buffs.Thank you."
5,This is how I remember this great documentary,"I have a DVD player with 5 levels of audio compression and found with some minor adjustments I could get the audio right. The music is only slightly louder than the narration, and that is how I remember VAS was way back when. As for audio quality, it is poor just like it was way back when. The music, the narration, etc...is not the highlight of this documentary anyway, it is the footage. A classic. Ranks right up there with the World at War. But remember this is 1952 and the audio sounds like it. I wouldn't want it any other way."
1,Was the sound engineer sleeping?,"I read the reviews and the problems with the sound variations but I chose not to believe them. ""Victory at Sea"" was a landmark documentary of its day. The Rogers soundtrack has been with us echoing in our minds since the 50's. I awaited with eager anticipation for its release on DVD and The History Channel dares to place its name on the box of this publication. Shame!!! I could understand variations from episode to episode in the decibels of sound (though that is not even necessary with today's technology), but the range of volume fluctuations within one episode is inexcusable. A remastered version in both video and above all in audio would not be amiss. Come on now A&E and the History Channel give us the real goods."
5,I don't know why people are complaining...,"This series was originally released in 1952...there was no such thing as ""DTS"" or ""Dolby Digital"" and DVD's were decades away. This reflects the quality of the time...mono sound. I was a little leery of purchasing the set because I too am an audiophile with a fairly high end home entertainment system. However, I got it home and have watched 2 discs so far and have been nothing but happy. Sound quality is fine for me...music and narration are clear and crisp, just need to turn an A/V receiver up a little louder than most other DVD's. It's a classic documentary from 1952...don't expect 5.1 surround with this as it was never intended to be released as such (and never should be in my opinion). If you want dazzling sound effects get Band of Brothers or Saving Private Ryan...if you want a documentary showing some fantastic footage get Victory at Sea."
1,BuyVictoryatSea.com,"[...]Don't buy the set from the TV commercial either. The sound is consistent (always bad, garbled and distorted). Level changes occur as the narration sometimes drops to a low level. The picture is out of focus on all 26 chapters. During the last 13 chapters ,the picture jumps back and forth a frame or two several times in succession whenever there is fast movement on the screen. The sound does not break up during these frame jumps. Like the DVD under review, this inexpensive version also seems to be made from very bad VHS tapes. I own 9 episodes on Laser Disk and the video is sharp and the sound is fine. I only wish I had the whole set on Laser disks."
1,For Pre-Schoolers Maybe....,"What a stinker! I just returned the copy I received yesterday for credit. Most of the stuff included is pretty tacky, I think. Not something I would consider giving as a gift to anyone. Might be good if you're looking for projects for the ""little ones"" but not for gifts that one adult would give to another. I was really dissapointed in the ideas presented."
2,naked eternity,"i want to enjoy any reasonably intelligent movie with a frank interest in sex. a movie that would also hold the interest of the lead actors, at least occasionally. i'm sorry but the movie seemed interminable, highlited by an occasional art studio quality nude that gave this viewer a small drink of tepid water to travel the next streach of desert with."
2,Why did I buy this book?,"Why did I buy this book? It was one of those darn impulse purchases. I mean it's not terrible or anything In some ways it explains the well-known phenomena of creativity after intellectual struggle and more interestingly it provides an explanation of why meditation etc. may work. But there's not much substance and it is certainly not worth full price. Also towards the end it pushes religion on the reader. If this type of thing bugs you, be forewarned."
5,Fun family activity,"We sit around the table together and play this game. We work together to set up the board at the beginning, and we place pieces when we see things that work. Each person placing a piece explains how he/she knows that piece goes there. My 5 year old enjoys it, and my mom does too! My mom normally dislikes number games, so the color option is good for her. In certain lighting, it can be tough to tell some of the colors apart, but it's not too bad."
3,A real brain teaser,"I would give this a higher rating, but I think it would have been better if the manufacturer had picked more colors rather than doing light and dark versions of the same color. It definitely is fun to play and very challenging."
5,"Great Value, Great Fun!","I bought this for my daughter, and she spends hours with it.... much less on TV, I might add. The game is sturdy, packs away well, and is very much mental challenge for her. I am really pleased with it, and so is she."
5,Wonderful ColorKu Game!,"My 11 year old niece received this for Christmas. We had so much fun playing with it; and it was nice to see strategy she used compared to mine. I bought two, one for me and one for my friends at a Real Estate Office to put in the conference room where people usually wait 30 minutes. At my birthday party, we had 12 different people fighting over who could study and play!"
3,Problem With Colors of Balls & Cards,"The board is well-made, but the colors of some the balls are too similar to each other, and the colors of the balls don't all match the colors on the cards used to layout the puzzle. E.g.: The Orange ball is almost the same shade as the Red ball. The Blue ball is so dark it's similar to the Purple ball. The Light Blue ball (almost cyan) doesn't match ANYTHING on the card. Why no White ball? And, there are exactly 81 balls, the number required to play the game. No extras. Should be an extra set of balls. Last, it's properly labeled 'Ages 8 and Up' but I wouldn't recommend it for any family with a small child in the house-- balls perfect size to choke if put into mouth."
4,"Color is attractive and easy to read, but mapping color to number no fun","I like the hardwood board and color balls. The game is fun to play and very durable.I used to play Sudoku game with pencil on papers. With this set, now I can play on board.Something I don't like is that it is hard to mapping Sudoku on paper to the board since it involves frequent color to number mapping.I notice a new board Sukugo color+number seems more interesting and now on my holiday wishlist."
1,I didn't care for this at all,I much prefer Primitive Cool which has some really memorable tracks and She's the Boss second. This album is totally forgetable and a big disappointment.
1,haynes repair manual Vulcan 750,"I enjoy riding and restoring motorcycles in my spare time, so it is important to me to have accurate information, specs, and things of that nature. I have encountered errors in the specs and in the proceedures, one of which almost cost me a crankshaft. So far, I would not recommend this book to anyone. It has been quite a hinderance on this project. Clymer manuals might be a better choice for this bike."
5,His Name Is Joel,"I have finally found a book written by a mom who was a Christian before the birth of her son Joel.This mom tells of her journey ofof raising her son(from birth) to be included in her church family and of the rejection of that same community by their indifference. Finding a church when you have a child with special needs is still a challenge in the year 2001! I have met Kathy and know that her journey with her son and finding a welcoming church are not over but,she is hopeful. This book will affirm anyone else who has been here. Her other book A Place Called Acceptance is also another five star read."
4,Easy-going R&B,"This is truly a good album. If you don't compare it to the mega-hit ""Silk Degrees"" what you end up with is a decent excursion into some funky rock and laid-back R & B. It's hard to find an artist who's true to this sound (among the good ""blue-eyed soul"" performers are Bobby Caldwell, Rick Astley and Joe Cocker) but Boz comes through with a brilliant set of soulful tunes. ""A clue"" and ""Whatcha Gonna Tell Your man"" are jazzy love balads that are highly reminiscent of the ""seventies"" sound similiar to Earth Wind and Fire and the Ohio Players. ""We're waiting"" with it's complex jazz-blues structure has a Steely-Dan-esque sound that, sadly, so few artists are good at.In context this is a very good album and we all owe Boz Skaggs a warm thank you for bringing such good music to the world."
5,A new Christmas classic,We watch this every year during the holidays. Great story. Wonderful characters. A little something for everyone - kids & adults alike. We finally upgraded to the DVD a few years ago after wearing out the VHS tape...
4,Light fun read,"A ligh,t fun, fast, read, with a super-natural twist. Likeable characters, would love to read more by this author soon"
4,Diasppointed - Problem solved!,"I'm very disappointed that the link to the cookbook doesn't work. I don't find any way to contact the authors on their website. Any chance this will be corrected?ADDITION TO ORIGINAL REVIEW: The authors graciously corrected the error. As for the book, it was a very enjoyable read. I guessed ""who done it"" before the end of the book but the characters were interesting and well developed."
3,Link in Kindle edition does not work,"I downloaded the Kindle book, and tried to go to the link listed at the end to download the cookbook, but it does not work. I copied and pasted it into Notebook and removed the spaces, but even after that fix the download link was not anywhere to be found. I just want to report the error.I have not read the book yet, so this is purely a functional error review. If I had found a place on the author's website to contact, I would have handled it that way."
5,Uplifting and Joyful,"I bought this for my sister when she was going through a stressful time and of course I read it before I sent it to her. I loved it. And she told me later that it was just what she needed. She loved it. We both loved it.It is a delightful, cheery book with sweet messages about living life fully."
5,elegant look at closeout price,Grab this before it disappears. Product being closed out in some colors. It's a fabulously elegant look for your dining table at a wonderful price.
3,the tunes rule - don't know about the talk though,"Pete Pete Pete, what are you doing??? I mean, sure, a guy's gotta take a chance in music. Especially a cutting edge innovator (sort of) like you.Okay, I can get that. But why don't you leave the ""talk bytes"" for a crappy album with bad music?Why'd you have to go and F - Up this awesome music by interspersing the talk talk talk in it?I am so upset. It takes the music down to the level of a bad TV show or something... AND THE MUSIC IS GREAT, that is why I am so bummed out.The clips definitely detract from being able to listen to the songs and rock out - totally kills any flow.Oh well, what can you do?Fortunately I got the CD for a dollar used, so its not like I put good money onto it!"
4,Great phone but problems with T-Mobile.,This is a great phone but for some reason it keeps shutting off and then turning back on and says Searching. I think it might have something to do with T-Mobile. Just wanted to warn people that are checking this phone out and also have T-Mobile.
1,Disappointed,This is an oversized book with plenty of pictures but there weren't enough facts to make it interesting.
3,It was OK.,"I'm 12, and I was really excited when I bought this book. But when I started reading it, I didn't find anything really interesting. Except, the pictures were great. I'd recommend the 1999 edition. They could've done a lot better."
2,"Lots of ideas, but needs more clarity","I've found this book to offer more rituals than other books I've read on the topic of grief, but the explanations seem cursory at times, and I'm finding myself asking ""huh?"" a lot. Frankly, Good Grief Rituals feels rather amateurish. However, I applaud the author for including many ideas, but perhaps she might have gone deeper with less."
1,Strange,These grief rituals are out there....not for the general population....I was hoping to use some of this with bereaved individuals but I don't think these ideas would go over well. More for the very creative and expressive types....
3,not enough info to buy this book,can you show a table of contents? i am a software developer and i wouldn't buy this book before knowing what it covers
4,brilliant,I thought the soundtrack beautifully complemented the film. I especially adore the E.L.O.'s mr. blue sky. sometimes one must dance along to such joyous chanteys.
3,movie versus cd,during watching the film the music sounded delightful and I wonder if the soundtrack is also such good? it happens that on the cd sometimes you can find a little bit another climate.. and maybe someone knows what is the title of the song which is incidental music of the credits (and who sings that)? I'll be grateful for the answer :-)
2,You only want this for one song...,"...so you know the rest is disposable. I sure hope Beck is getting the lion's share of the sales from this because his tune (and the only one that matters) is the reason you bought this. The rest is dross. One-minute musical vignettes by Brion, the [now] over commercialized ELO tune that will make you puke if you have to hear it one more time, forgettable Indian pop that was in the movie for like 2 seconds, and annoying garbage from Polyphonic Spree.So you get one good song for $10 and now that I've heard it a few times I'm pretty sure it's not worth it."
5,Buy the movie.. and Buy this soudtrack. Jon Brion is amazing.,"Jon Brion does such a great job capturing emotion with great music. hes also so damn great and fitting sound witht the mood of a movie. if you liked this movie, by all means, buy the soundtrack. you will not be dissapointed. Eevery time it listen it not only reminds me of the amazing movie, it makes me feel.. just.. good.Also, be sure to pick up his solo record, Meaningless.IF YOU LIKED THE MOVIE, BUY THIS CD, YOU WONT REGRET IT!"
4,Solid good read,"An interesting and involving read on the rise, demise and fall of Enron. The book draws the reader into this story of of corporate greed, corruption and deception."
4,Interesting,Many good insigts into the background in the fall of Enron.This book does not get too technical and is an easy read.I found interesting the exploration of the characters of Enron into their personalities and behaviors. How this affected the decision-making processes at Enron which led to its downfall.The storyline in this book seems to jump back and forth in time not following a consistent pattern of events.
5,Gripping page turner,"Power Failure is a fascinating, shocking look inside the rotten core of one of the most celebrated companies of our time. This book grippingly explains how Enron went from a stuffy pipeline company to flashy corporate star by committing massive fraud. Why and how the press, the analysts, the accountants and the regulators failed in their jobs and went along for the ride is lucidly portrayed. Full of outrageous characters and incidents, this beautifully written book will have you telling anyone nearby, ""You've got to hear this!"" Power Failure will help you understand why the 90s bubble burst and give you an understanding of corporate manipulation. You will be better prepared the next time the ""most brilliant company around"" emerges."
3,buy this for the interactive stuff,"even for the killing joke completist, this live recording from probably their least inspired phase is weak to say the least. killing joke are a live band - it is their intensity and venom which drew us to them in the first place. And that's exactly what's missing from this recording. HOWEVER, the edition i bought came with a second CD-ROM which contains video footage of the entire performance, along with some other pretty cool stuff. the fact that the gig was played in broad daylight to a seemingly indifferent crowd aside, what killing joke fan wouldn't want to own that much stuff for the price of a regular album?"
2,Mass produced and boring,"This album is poor at best. It is completely unoriginal and features little involvement from Crosby on the songs. He wrote about 2 of them. It features Crosby singing with synthesizers and a backing band backing him up. He doesn't even play any guitar. Also, Crosby has lost all his vocal originality as heard on his CSNY songs (Long Time Gone, Almost Cut My Hair etc).We know what side of the hill Crosby's on now (over it). Neil Young is still cranking out good stuff. Not so for Crosby. Don't buy this album unless you own every recording David Crosby has ever made. Look to his heyday in the 70s when he did his best work with CSNY or Younger than Yesterday, his last album with the Byrds (he wrote almost half of the songs)."
2,"history, please","For those who know little of Rock history, rather than ""ripping off Joni Mitchell"", David Crosby was around for years before she became popular, with the Byrds. He was a friend of hers and taught Joni Mitchell to use ""open tunings"" on her guitar, and use a modal singing style which she uses on ""Ladies of the Canyon"".The Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, the Greatful Dead, The Jefferson Airplane, The Quicksilver Messenger Service, Judy Collins were are friends and moved in and out of San Francisco in the late sixties. Stills was in love with Judy Collins and wrote ""Suite: Judy Blue Eyes"" for her. All sing together on Crosby's excellent landmark album ""If I Could Only Remember my Name"".this album, unfortunately, is not his best effort."
3,"I enjoyed the book, although it was fairly repetitive.","I enjoyed the book, although it was fairly repetitive. The characters reiderated their feelings more than once, and the plot was rather dry. A story based on the price of furniture...? Anyhow, the story was easy to follow and with only three main characters, was a sinch to understand."
3,Price was good -- a little harsh finish for my purposes,"I got this to tumble pinballs & I think I got the wrong stuff cause I ended up with a lot of pretty, uniform scratches. Otherwise, I bet this media is good for other cleanings, just not for a mirror finish."
3,EOISE IN HOLLYWOOD,"Make sure you know that this is animated and not a movie, like ""Eloise at the Plaza."" My mistake. A little pricy for 45 minutes."
3,Push Past Your Limit To Grow,"I felt this book's main premise was a useful idea, but nothing novel. Expanding past one's limit, followed by a rest period resulting in growth whether physical or psychological. I liked the informational nature of the book, however, I didn't care much for the examples of actual people written about in it. I understand it is used to help prove the points, but it appeared to be fluff to me and I would have liked more information to drill the point home and more sources to back up the info.Those opinions aside, it is worthwhile, to the point and contains enough information to satisfy reading it once, but I don't expect to re-read it."
1,Price for Kindle at price equal to or lower than Paperwork please.,I would buy this book for kindle if Kindle version is lower than price of paperback. Come on guys we all know there is no production cost so pricing the Kindle version at same price as hardback is only gouging the customer.
4,Great companion to Covey's Seven Habits,"When do you get the most work done? For me, it is in the morning. If I could get away with working from 5am to noon, I'd be the most productive person in the office! For others, it might be the afternoon. This is part of the idea behind The Power of Full Engagement. It is a book about managing our energy.The authors have been very successful in coaching world-class athletes to peak performances. This book shares those principles with the rest of us. The book teaches about managing energy in the mental, physical, spiritual, and emotional areas of life. If all we do is try to manage time, we will fail. What's the use of having your time mapped out if you don't have any energy?I CONSIDER THIS TO BE A GREAT COMPANION BOOK TO STEPHEN COVEY'S SEVEN HABITS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
3,Not as expected,"I bought this book as a requirement of a Leadeship course. This is a self-help book with some interesting advice, but repetitive, not very well written, and many common sense advice as well. Overall, don't expect much out of this book."
5,Ambition without peak energy is useless. Read this book if you want to be in the top 1% of peak performers.,"The 4:8 Principle: The Secret to a Joy-Filled LifeThe Power of Full Engagement definitely makes the The 1% Club's Top Ten List!Ambition without peak energy is useless. This book by Jim Loehr and Tony Schwartz uses an athletic metaphor to illustrate how easy it is to mismanage our energy reserves, but also, how this can be corrected. This has been required reading form my clients since its release in 2003.You will find case studies that are easy to relate to and simple, straightforward action steps to address the real energy crisis. This book is loaded with great content and has excellent chapter summaries and a complete recap at the end of the book.Here is one key point that you should study further: ""Most of us are under trained physically and spiritually (not enough stress) and over trained mentally and emotionally (not enough recovery)."" Grab the highlighter!"
1,Don't buy this book,This books in three sentences:1. Exercise2. Eat well3. Keep time for yourselfThat's it. Common sense. I don't need a book to know that.
1,...,"Can you post more images to see how it is? How does the dial pad look like? Is there call back button, what's the ringer like? Where do you connect the land line in?"
1,Stole his best ideas from Bill Hicks-- And it shows--,"Is Denis Leary listenable? Probably-- But when you can listen to the real thing, why would you settle for second best? Check out Bill Hicks' comedy albums-- or check out the book AMERICAN SCREAM (recent bio of Bill Hicks) which details the bits Leary stole from Hicks."
4,Pretty good CD,"I bought this CD for my husband for his birthday, as he LOVES Denis Leary.. There are a couple good songs on it, but it's mostly standup, and all the references didn't necessarily compute with us (we're in our mid 20's) but other than that it's a pretty good CD.. we're glad we bought it!"
4,Wow!,"The world loses Bill Hicks to pancreatic cancer.Dennis Leary copies his act and releases an album called No Cure For Cancer.As the Pope would say, this man has chutzpah!"
5,so fun,soooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! fun i have the first four medal of honor games this one is the best by far i got this game last week it's my favorite game i have ever played
5,Excellent,"Very Comfortable, very warm and defitnitely something to wear and show off at the wings game while watching them dominate."
4,A brilliant epoque culminates!,"Joined by fellow-musicians such as Take 6, Branford Marsalis and Bobby McFerrin, this celebration-album offers a laid-back jazz that inspirez any jazz-lover to pay close attention to the old-style."
5,"It tingled my Senses with Every Note, An Absolute Must Have","This is my 1st MJQ CD & i think its one of the best work yet ever done by this magnificent group.My favourate instrument here is the the bass guitar it has that feel that holds the whole group together, these guys keep on taping that bass Oh! unbelievable. The trumpet on ""willow weep for me"" is very much visible.on track 7 the tenor saxophone starts with mellow sound & then Milt Jackson playing on vibes need no explanation the legeng was a talented artist.I actually played this CD all night as I could not get enough of each song.There's also Take 6 & Bobby Macfarren doing the vocals on ""Bags Grove"" & also on the last track. there's a song recorded live Switzerland? These are highly experienced men of jazz & what they did here was incredile the best work. Im still listening & will be back with more information on this magnificent work."
2,Wrong aspect ratio,I like Pocoyo a lot. It's a great show. The reason I'm giving this dvd only 2 stars is because it's squashed. The show is broadcast at 4:3 but for some reason the people who put this dvd out squished it down to make it widescreen. The characters aren't as appealing when they are squashed. Let the buyer beware.
5,Just as Fantastic as the First!!!,"If you've read my review for ""Meet Pocoyo"", you know how much our family loves it. Same can be said here; I can't say it's better, but I can say it's nice to have another one in the series."
1,NAH ICE CREAM MAN YOU NEED TO RELAX,"You need to relax and understand how horrible this music is. I agreee with the person who said their music is like a ministrel show. it would only make sense that you would love with such redundant garbage. With a name like Ice cream man the dope dealer it doesn't suprise me, nor does it say much about your taste in music. You and everybody else need to grow up and listen to some real rap music like Nas and Common who talk about some real sh*t. What do the ying yang twins talk about besides a bunch of ying yang?"
5,This Cd is off the chain!!!,On the real this Cd is off the damn chain!!! Everybody should get this cd and support the Ying Yang Twins!!! I'm really feeling this cd.
1,Feel like cheated,"I ordered this for my one year daughter, It was too small than I expected and none of the feature works which was mentioned. It doesn't bark and doesn't do anything. My daughter never played with it not even once. I really feel like cheated.I would suggest not to waste your money on this product."
4,"Cute, Fun, but a few negtives","My son LOVES this lil puppy toy. But as a parent I have 2 problems with it: 1) the string is a little too long, it wouldn't work as well if it was shorter, I realize, but it could still wrap around his neck so that concerns me. 2) like a previous review said, it does tip over all the time. I constantly turn it over for him but then it tips right back over very easily. I do like that this is a ""basic"" toy that dosen't require batteries, and that the noise is not loud at all. My son really likes it so overall I think this is a great toy. I just have to keep an eye on him while he plays with it."
2,breaks easily,Couldn't stand up to my 18-month-old girl playing normally with it. I've superglued a leg back on several times (plastic piece connecting the leg to its wheel snapped) and finally just pitched it.
3,Decent toy,"I had a toy similiar to this when I was a child. My son really enjoys it from time to time. It's not as engaging as other toys, but it's a classic and very durable."
2,not exactly how i pictured it...,"I really thought this toy would be cuter, but it was really simple. My 13month old daughter doesn't really play with it. It's okay for the price, I just thought it would bark and flap its ears as this is what I thought it did, but it doesn't."
2,It's okay,"I like this dog because it's cute, but it's a very average toy. The dog doesn't stay upright when being pulled by the string. So usually my daughter is dragging the dog around on its back. However, she still enjoys dragging it around."
5,"Simple, long-lasting fun!","I purchased this toy for my 15 month-old daughter because she became attached to it at the gym's daycare. I'd read complaints from others who'd purchased the dog that said the kids became frustrated that the dog would easily topple over, but I went for it anyway (at such a low price, why not?!). She spent the first HOUR with it when it arrived, walking it, arranging it back on its legs after toppling over, petting it, kissing it (we don't have dogs but it's a baby sign she likes to use around the neighborhood a lot), and asking us to walk it with her. It's so durable, too, that we've taken it with us to the grocery store, in the garden, and to the mall and it keeps her occupied with something constructive rather than wandering around aimlessly, or strapped helplessly into a stroller.It's gotten regular attention for nearly two months now and is amongst her favorite toys.I love this dog too. :-)"
3,Good reading!!,"While I feel that this was not Ansa's best work. The book was very amusing. This was my first time reading about a baby born with a caul. After reading, I felt enlightened."
3,Interesting and informative,I have always wondered about the caul and this book was informative. My brother was born with one and he always had the gift to see the future and I thought he was just pulling my leg. I guess there is some truth to the power of the caul.
5,girl. ooh!,"I AM MELINDA...AND I AM A READER. PLEASE IF YOU NEVER-EV-VA READ ANOTHER BOOK, READ THIS ONE. IT TAKESYOU SO DEEP AND IT JUST PUT YOU THERE WITH THE CHARACTERS. LENA AND HERMAN. I READ IT AWHILE BACK AND IT STILL GIVES ME CHILLS AND SHIVERS IN A GOOD WAY. IT IS SO PASIONATE AND YOU WILL LOVE IT. NOW, THIS IS A BOOK YOU WON'T PUT DOWN-FORREAL, CHECK IT OUT AND E MAIL ME IF YOU LOVED IT TOO. mismelodie@hotmail.com"
5,One of the best solo albums of the 1990s,"In today's country music market where the singers (both male and female) are interpreters rather than songwriters, Kieran Kane is almost an anachronism: he performs material he writes himself. His songs are deceptively simple, heartfelt, and melodic. Each song in this collection is well crafted and, altogether, comprise one of the best solo albums to have come along in quite awhile. Unfortunately out-of-print, here's hoping that Kane can license the tracks and release them on his own label."
5,Good Group,Excellent group / CD. To bad I discovered them after they no longer exist!Superb musicians song writers and amazing vocals. All songs have a unique musical style varying from Black Crow's to Darius Rucker or even Robert Plant.
4,Buy this at Target for the extra tracks,"Great album, but if you purchase it at Target, you get a bonus CD with 5 cover songs. (I'm on Fire, Come Monday, etc.)"
5,The Best # 1 cd,"I Like this cd. I like the songs The Woman With You and There Goes My Life, but my favorite is Anything But Mine. It reminds me of the time me and an old boyfriend went to see the fireworks together by the hot july moon light. It was one magical night with the band playing and the lights in the sky."
1,When the Sun Goes Down,I will have to be honest- it was a true disappointment. None of the songs seem to really stand out on their own.I just felt Kenny threw together a CD for the College crowd and young girls that seems to be his following to just to market another CD.It really had no substance as far as I am concerned. This CD does not compare to his others.The only song I thought was somewhat decent was:There goes my Life.
5,better and better,"I happened upon this cd the other day and had to do a triple take before realizing it was an entirely new recording with many peices I'd never heard. I think John Williams has done a wonderful job of reaching out further than the typical guitar ""master"" would, he did the Barrios recording, then an album either by Greek composers or inspired by Greece (the pieces by Satie were based on Greek characters etc.) and then the Magic Box (African folk). I keep wondering when he'll team up with Paco Pena or Paco de Lucia or even Gerardo Nunez for a flamenco collaboration. Or delve into a Russian folk setting, that might be fun. There's so much opportunity for the broadening of the spectrum when it comes to the indigineous folk music of different contries. I'm so glad to see Williams taking the time to explore. Excellent, excellent album."
5,Love it,This is exactly what I was looking for. Spent a lot of time going to local stores looking for something similar but all i found were small cheap spice racks. This thing holds all of my wife's spices and still has room for more. She loves it!
3,not awesome but it doesn't suck,This game does not suck but on the other hand it does not totally rock either. You have the options of playing with the actual robots from the show or you can be creative and build your own. I've tried the tournament mode and that is cool. No you can't save your games because there is no game to save...
5,great job of making battle bots in to a game.,This game does a great job of capturing the battlebots experience in to a video game. It made me realize hoe much I missed the show.
5,Good,"This game is ok. The gameplay is average, but what really is good about it is the control. Most PS2 shooters could be very good except aiming is hard (example, Brothers in Arms for PS2, the PC version is great, PS2 is the same, except its really hard to aim IMO) but I find no problem with aiming in this game."
3,"under rated , undiscovered","this game is an exellent first person shooter. The fx are aboveaverage when making a kill. You can use mostly everthing in youenvironment. This game is under rated, and for the most partundiscovered. It's worth owning. The price is great also. I ama hardcore first person shooter fan and I aprove."
4,InfamousS1W,This is a sleeper action game. Which is much longer than I expected.Graphics is great and gameplay is awesome. Only con was the health is given to you always but that do not mean you can't die. I'm an action gamer so those who like action games should give this one a try.
3,It doesn't fit Suzuki Grand Vitara XL-7,"Amazon part selector says it fits 2002 Grand Vitara XL-7, but it doesn't. My fault was not to check through Beck Arnley e-Catalog, where it is clearly stated it fits only regular Grand Vitara."
2,Very Basic Stuff,Kinda disappointed in the methods used. The solutions to most of the problems were solved with an automatic tennis ball dispenser. Very disappointing. Would not try another video from this trainer.
4,MUSIC: 4.5 Stars - VOCALS: 2 Stars,"SHADOWS FALL - THE WAR WITHIN-Let me make it clear.... I HATE their singer. There is no nice way to put it. His singing voice is terribly annoying... His screaming voice seems too forced... and it is equally bad.However, I am stunned by the musicianship on this album. It showcases some of the best modern metal talent there is out there. The drumming phenomenal, the guitars are great (some nice solos on the CD) and the Bass holds it's own.Like Unearth there is little original being offered here... but also like Unearth they are at the top of the Metalcore game... If I could get past the singer and his lyrics I may have ranked it higher... I've tried listening to it dozens of times and I just can't get past the Voice.Best Songs: Act Of Contrition and Eternity Is Within.3.75 STARSIF YOU LIKED, AGREED, OR APPRECIATED THIS PLEASE CLICK YES FOR:""Was this review helpful?"""
3,could have been better,"I bought this cd out of curiosity and I really wanted to get into this band because of ""what drives the weak"" song, so when I first listen to it, it was really hard to get into because the singers voice doesnt really have alot of range but the guitars and drums are well done. Its an overall good cd and I'll recommend if you like this than you should get into lamb of god and killswitch engage."
2,Better than the previous stuff but still no cigar.,"This is not the groundbreaking, shredding, and improved SF album that I was waiting for. True, SF does not seem to wallow in endless nu-metal chops for a change,(the nu-metal is still there mind you, just not as obvious) but the vocals are still just as bad, or worse than ever. Great leadwork, decent overall musicianship and crappy vocals all average out to make this a better-than-normal-but-still-mediocre album. SF should definately consider getting a new vocalist, and trying to stay away from that damned boring, simple song structure. (if they can solo that good, then why cant they make the rest of the music as interesting? I dont get it..)"
4,Keeps the eyes moving,"The reviews call this thing uneven, but maybe they were holding their heads crooked at the time. Lisa's characters *feel* warm to the touch, and their lives, while swimming in extraordinary events, ring as true and as ordinary as any of us. These are not people living fantastically unconcerned lives in an fantasy setting, these are you and me trying to cope with the billions of forces that weigh on us daily. We can't filter them all. Ray and Ruby try to turn towards each other and make ""it"" work, but those jagged jarring events are always just around the corner."
3,Dive,"Dive is readable but could be better, I don't know if the writer has published other books before. the story line is good. The style of writing is like reading a classified add or a list of things to do. it constantly jumps from subject to subject and the refference to what will happen in the future that never comes to pass. for instance ""he will later tell her that"". or ""some time later she would remember that. It's distracting. By all means I'm not a professional critic, as encouragement, never stop writing and perfecting you craft."
3,Cowboy Basic,"Compendium of mostly old and not particularly well known western songs. Don Edwards has a very good voice which is the high point of these recordings; otherwise the CD does not reach out and grab you. For the western purist, the old cattle songs are reminiscent of a day gone by."
5,Mellow but Complex Rose City Sound,"Amazing, amazing, amazing. These guys are incredibly talented. Multi-layered music, lovely vocals, intriguing lyrics and an overall fantastic experience. Highly recommended.The guys played together again this year and I missed it! I'm very very bummed..."
3,Toner cartridge,The toner works as described by the manufacturer. I always use the brand name replacements and have found them to perform well.
1,not very helpful,I did not find the cookbook worth getting. Many others have been much more interesting
4,it was symbolic in many ways of western life,I thought that this book was very difficult to read coming from the stand point of a 9th grader. but after learning all of the symbolism in this book i learned the true meaning that Faulkner meant when writing this book
5,A+ rating.,"I just received this cd/DVD today. It was wonderful. a must have for any ABBA collector. I can't quit playing the CD, I was soooo Glad they added I am the City and You owe me one. Now this CD is complete. Yeas it would have been nice to have Just Like That on here but oh well. Now They need to rerelease Waterloo in Deluxe form. also I hope they do it for Ring Ring and Abba. Then my collection will be complete. Hey I just thought, How about a deluxe version of Abba Live??? you never know. Now go and buy this. You won't regret it."
4,Maturity never sounded so good,"How can the impending break-up of 4 members who are no longer happy together sound so terrific? ""Visitors"" is mature, thoughtful and ... dark (Yes, Abba and Dark together). Gone is the bounce, but welcome are the best lyrics Bjorn Ulvaeus ever wrote (stand-out ""When All is Said and Done""). Soulful and sad, this album is the perfect swansong for the greatest pop band in popdom's history."
1,just read Plato,"I am an avid reader and this book came to me with the utmost of congratulatory reviews. I was very excited to pick it up and after about 15 small chapters in it took all my strength to keep reading.All of his musings i have read before in PLato, Socrates, Aritotle, COnversations with God, Tao Te Ching, the Upanishads...and on and on. They are just recreations of thought from other texts written long long ago and written much better. This book is for people who LOVE john grisham and the davinci code and think those books are magical. This book is for those people who adore the alcehmist and the prophet and the secret and think those novels are the first ever to touch upon that type of thought.if you haven't read any of the philisophical classics than you will enjoy this book and it will ""blow your mind"" if you have..don't bother.."
5,A Fabulous Read,"I saw the movie first, and was drawn to read the book. Even though I loved the movie, I loved the book even more. Kundera's style is so fun: humorous, philosophical, sexy, simple, layered, historically contextual. I love the cultural context of this book and its exploration of sexuality, psychology, monogamy, war, loyalty, etc. A great read!"
3,Excellent book but very late delivery,"Excellent book, but the delivery was delayed by more than ten days! Don't go with this seller. Highly recommend other books by Milan Kundera too. They are all heavy reads, but always have something excellent to say."
4,This book scarred me,"A few years ago, my boyfriend gave me this book to read. The main character, Tomas, seriously disturbed me. After I finished reading my boyfriend said he was a lot like Tomas! Not encouraging. Anyways, just now a friend gave me a different book by Kundera and I'm a bit scared to read it! I still remember the image of those women marching around the pool and Tomas' insistence on the 1% difference. Kundera really got to the heart of what some women feel like, and some men, and stuck a knife in and twisted it. I give this book a high rating because it was powerful, even if disturbing."
3,it is really so light,"the book really does not live up to what i had been told about it. i approached the book with the certainty that i was going to find a masterpiece of modern existetialism, but instead i found a story which seems to be so empty, and so superficial as to be unbereably light to read. i hope to get a good impression from his other books, because this one has left me empty."
3,Slow start but very interesting,"The book was an unusual one and confusing at times, but overall it was an o.k. book."
3,not a favourite but not a waste of time,"I endeavoured to read this book in a vain attempt to look clever. Didn't work! You do actually have to be clever....no honestly, this book is confusing in parts but the character development of tomas and tereza was the key to this book being the enjoyment it was. I loved relishing in the cruelty Tomas inflicted on women, it was a revelation into the mind of manipulative men. Tereza bothered me as she seemed spineless but in retrospect i see the love she had for him and the insecurities in her own mind made her tomas' slave for love. Brilliantly written, poorly understood, although i wouldn't class this subject as everyday thinking material, one would most likely go insane!"
3,"Some interesting philosophical thoughts, but much too conescending","Having watched this as a movie many years ago, I finally picked up the book. I enjoyed the first half and was able to focus on the story, and consider some of the more philosophical observations. Over time, though, Kundera's voice starts to ware away at the essence of the book, because he takes such a condescending view on his characters."
5,This book changed my life...,"...or perhaps more appropriately, this book speaks to my life - describes my life - reflects my life. I believe, once in a lifetime, you come across something that so clearly mirrors your view of the world, but in a strange, beautiful, and unimaginable way.Taken as a story, it is a compelling tale of love, life and the struggles faced in Prague during the Russian uprising. But when taken on a deeper level, an ""ur-level,"" this book speaks to one's view on oneself and their relationship to the eternal struggle of life.This is a book I have been reading every year for the last 15 years, and every reading brings about new thoughts, new ideas and new perspectives. Trust me - you will love this book."
4,Good purchase,"Exactly the book I was looking for - great photos, good hints, clear explanations. A pleasure for the eyes!"
5,Best cat toy ever!,"I have two wonderful cats but they are not the type to play with toys. They would play with the packaging before the toy. I bought this months ago and they still love it!!! They love that ""crinkly"" material. It is awesome!"
4,A pretty good product...,"These are light weight and virtually impenetrable. Sharp object can still penetrate the side walls though. Also getting the liners centered properly takes careful attention to detail, but so far so good. A far better way to go than regular tires alone."
5,Essential for double doors.,This was purchased to secure a storage building with double doors. The lock in the door handle and deadbolt are pretty useless on these types of doors. The hasp does NOT include any hardware. You have to decide the thickness of your door and purchase 3/8 dia. carriage head bolts for the installation. Drilling 3/8 inch dia. holes is also required. You will need flat washers and nuts with loc-tite to install. One 9/16 wrench to tighten down. Shouldn't take you 30 minutes. The hasp is very heavy and about 1/4 thick steel. Very satisfied.
1,worst DL ever!,"I was so excited when I received this book. That excitement crashed and burned after reading a few chapters of this book. How this author was able to make the lovely Tas into such a boring character(Tas & boring in the same sentence,unfathomable), I'll never know. This is the only DL book that I never finished and that's saying alot because I love, love, love DL. Please Ms Kirchoff,don't do this anymore to well loved characters."
3,Not for people older 12 years.,"Quite a nice book, but compared to the Legends and Chronicles it is written in a rather childish way, making the book a bit different from most of the other Dragonlance novels. The story took a lot of my imagination (flying carousels and crying woolly mamoths just aren't what they should be.) And yes I have to admit that even Tas gets a bit tiresome after a while. Interesting for kender-fans though...."
5,Fabulous acoustic performance!,"If I had to reccomend a CD to someone who wanted to start discovering Brazilian music, this would definitely be it. From Brazilian reggae to great rythms or sweet ballads, this CD has it all. I saw an acoustic performance by Gil in which he included most of the songs on this CD, the recording really catches Gilberto Gil's fantastic energy on stage. The musical arrangements are exquisite (giving beautiful parts to a flute or even the triangle!!). Definitely a must-have in your Brazilian CD collection."
1,Nearly useless for writers,"Other than a list of abnormal personality types and one or two other items that were probably cribbed from elsewhere, this book is of no help whatever to a writer that wants to understand the criminal mind. It's so heavily opinionated without supporting data and contains so much over-written prose that everything the author states is subject to skepticism. It got to the point that I just didn't believe anything he wrote. Many examples of the problems have been mentioned by other reviewers."
3,eh,"not a bad first effort, but despite what almost everyone here has said, Mayhem was always a second-rate black metal band. De Mysteriis is their quintessential release, and Grand Declaration of War is even more impressive, but Mayhem could never stand up to the true elite of the genre: Ulver, Satyricon, Darkthrone, Fleurety, and most of all, Burzum. check out Hvis Lyset Tar Oss or Nattens Madrigal for some true soul-wrenching black metal."
4,Awesome,"This was the ""man-liest"" claddagh ring I could find for my guy. I got it today within 4 days of ordering it. It looks really nice, came ahead of time, and comes in a great leather ring box. And it is quite affordable. Only complaint is the note that I wanted to come with it is cut-up computer paper taped to a card. :/ But for the most part, it is great. Just hope it fits! :)"
2,too loud,this isnt that good but other non-point albums are good. this is too loud and the music is offbeat and its not a good effort.
4,My Friend Liked It,My friend wanted this cd really bad and was excited when she received it.It came a lot faster than she expected.
2,So-So Roberta,"I purchased this CD for the song ""It Might Be You"", a beautiful song featurned in the movie ""Waiting to Exhale"". Other than this song, I found the remakes of most songs disappointing. I expected a little more from Ms. Flack."
5,A Real Faith Promoter,"A great, small booklet that helps explain some of the links between faith and science. I read the whole thing during a lunch break.Better to have an understanding of the Church of Jesus Chirst of Latter Day Saints (Mormons) before reading."
4,Highly recommended!,"This comprehensive well researched reference book is a complete eye opener. Aside from logical information about the reasons for use of coconut oil in daily living, it offers insight into a broad range of ailments and conditions for which coconut oil can be also used. It is clear concise and readily accessible to all readers. The book has enabled me to make small but tangible changes to my diet and self care regime which have brought about noticeable improvements. I've purchased multiple copies and given them out to friends and family."
4,What is the difference between Stiga T8612 and T8612A,"Stiga makes T8612 which is widely available and T8612A available on in Sports Chalet (in California). The T8612A seems to be half the price of T8612. Does anyone know how both of them compare with each other?Both of them look sturdy construction, smooth table top with protected corners.Thanks"
4,A German grunt's view of WWII,This books offers the common man's view of the war from the perspective of an infantrymanYou really get a sense of what it was like to be on the eastern front for many years fighting the RussiansThe only thing missing was a prolog about the man's life after the war in Germany
4,chilling & effective,"the movie tells the story of two sisters, working as maids, who through a sad combination of servitude, ignorance, psychological ailments, incest & lack of privacy, brutally murder two of their employers.the film captured me from the first scene, and i was riveted throughout- i gave it 4 instead of 5 stars, because i wanted more on their early childhood- but as the director comments in the included interview- 'what you leave out is as important as what you leave in'.highly recommended!!!"
2,"Sent all forms, but no Rebate ever received from Lexar.","I admit that I chose Lexar over Sony because Lexar was offering a rebate at the time. I have also completed the rebate forms and sent it in but have never received the rebate. I know it takes 6 to 8 weeks, but its been 4 months and still nothing from Lexar. Lexar's customer service that I called to check on the rebate is a joke. You'll be better off buying a genuine Sony product for a few bucks more. Had the rebate check been sent, yes this would have been a good bargain. But, I see it as Bad Customer Relations that Lexar wants to promote. Why don't they honor completed Rebate forms and issue Rebates due the customer?"
2,You get what you pay for,"The only upside of this item is that it ""works"". Everything about it feels cheap. The accessories are a pain to get in and out of the case and the plastic lid that holds the front of the case closed is flimsy. I highly recommend that you spend a little more on something that you won't be infinitely disappointed with."
4,'The Block Report' gets an A-,"Had I watched this video just once and then reviewed it, I think I would have given it 2.5 or 3 stars, because, in all honesty initially I was expecting more. But after looking at this video a second time I truly apreciate what it does and stopped thinking about what it doesn't do and my only lasting complaint is that it ended."
2,Great scenery; terrible direction,"Although the scenery is memorable in this Bardot film (including the female scenery), the direction is awful. And there are a few embarrassing moments. The worst is a stage-bound windmill (a la Don Quijote) scene where the shadow of the sails falls regularly on the background painting of distant hills! In short, Roger Vadim is a hit and miss director. He misses with this one. I only give it 2 stars for BB, the obnoxious pig whose life she saves, and the donkey, who seems to know the cinematic mess he's got himself into."
3,Just too cutesy,This movie might appeal to girls but it was just too cutesy with no emotional depth for my tastes. It was a feel good movie formula.
4,Loved it,This was a cute movie- clever idea and very easy to relate to. Why the hell can't I just rate it with stars?
5,Great story wish I had thought of it.,Fun story. I recommend it. I loved the different characters. Banderas and Benning cracked me up. I would have moved in.
3,nice bike but....,"this is a wonderful bike, but i didnt realize when i purchased it, it doesnt ""grow"" with your child. she hasnt out grown it yet, but once she does... there goes 50bucks. sad.it collaspses wonderfully, right in half so its great to fit in the trunk for a ride to the park. thats great.the parental ""wand"" is so/so you can push great, but you dont have any control over the direction of the bike. and taking it out is a PAIN.i really dont kow if i would buy this again if i had the choice.but it is a great bike.VERY sturdy. and ADORABLE."
3,Must be me. I found this a high quality boring album.,"I heard some of Mike's other music on the radio, so I read all the reviews and bought this album unheard. The musicianship is superb, but...I've tried to sit down and really listen to it, but I get bored and get up and start doing something, and the next thing I know, it's over, and I don't remember any of it. Must be me: everyone else loves it."
2,Disappointing in several ways,"The charaterizations in this novel are unconvincing; the sex scenes are not particularly erotic; and the descriptions of piloting a jumbo passenger jet are sometimes ludicrous.The author would have you believe that the male captain and female first officer (the only pilots on board) would both rise from their seats during flight to initiate sex in the cockpit while several hundred passengers and cabin crew members were on board. I kid you not--that scene is in this book. Talk about expecting the reader's ""suspension of belief""!"
5,Helpful and informative,I find this encouraging. It helps to know others are facing the same problems with adult children. Good reminders of how to keep sanity and deal with the ups and downs.
4,Englishmans' View of Utah,"William Chandless was an Englishman who, in 1855, set out as a teamster, hired to travel to Salt Lake City. In this account of his travels, Chandless describes his journey across the Plains westward, as made by the emigrant and the cattle-driver of that time. The second part of the book is of a different subject and nature than the first. Chandless writes a chronicle of his meeting with the Mormons, his observations, and his opinions. An interesting first hand account of the early Western migration in the United States and of the unique society to be found in Utah at that time."
3,Musical but not a good plot...,"This book has many lyrics that you can try to sing to but it doesn't exactly have the page-turning qualities. It doesn't have an exciting plot. This girl doesn't have enough problems to make things more exciting. The book doesn't even finish telling the results of the whole entire escape. Gives a bit of disapointment at the end. Yet this book is also good because it does have some normal teenage events in it and the coolness of being in a rock band. Yet these events are scattered when there isn't enough events to be scattered around in the story. Not the best book I ever read. If you want to read this book, I suggest you borrow one. But...it's not too bad."
4,I think this book really relates to a lot of people's lives.,"As I said above, this book is very realistic not in the sense that everybody is rich and famous just that most kids that I know have parents who put a lot of pressure on them to succeed. In baby-sitters club it's not as realistic. It's like they have a problem and within the same book it's solved. It's not like that in real life."
2,A waste of money,"There are far too many good party idea books on the market to consider, making this one a waste. There are very few original and creative ideas given in this book. I wish I hadn't spent the money on it."
5,Excellent as we knew it would be!,"We track down Patty Sachs materials because they are so brim full of stretching party planning to anyone's best. She has been invited to coordinate the event planning business incubation center in Mobile, Alabama because of this special ability to bring true quality to event planning in a multi-national training setting. She takes you to the brink with the basics and invites your imagination to fly making each event solid, but allowing for individual flair."
4,All-time favorite,"This is a great bra for my particular figure - comfortable, washes nicely, and I'm happy to have found it through Amazon as stores seldom stock this style. The best part is that it isn't padded, which is a current trend. In my size, I don't need padding!"
2,Poor fit/,This would have been a very comfortable bra except for the poor fit. Not supportive enough. Liked the design though. Sent it back.
2,Disappointed in this Bra.,"I purchased this bra in May at a big chain retail store. I'd never heard of the brand but thought I would try it as they actually had my size, which is hard to find and there is a liner inside the cups behind the lace. (Lace drives me nuts, it's scratchy and itchy.)In August the elastic started to come out of the straps in little strings. In September the left underwire broke, while I was at work, making for an extremely uncomfortable day. And a very sore spot that evening.This bra didn't even last me 5 months. And I paid quite a bit for it! Does anyone know if there is a Vanity Fair website where I can complain straight to them?In the meantime, don't waste your money. Stick with other better brands."
5,My toddlers love this video,"THe animation is simple and straight forward with lots of nice bright colors. The story lines easy to follow, and not overly preachy / politicaly correct. Most important of all, my two year old thinks that the video is hilarious, he just laughs and laughs. My three year old also likes to watch."
3,Looked Cute.,I have not seen this or have had a chance to ask my daughter how my grandson liked it...he loves Pororo so thought he might like this one...unfortunately the Pororo dvds were sold out at Christmas. This was my second choice.
4,"Lea's great, the songs aren't so much so","Now, while I must admit that I disliked a great number of these sappy, rock-pop tunes, I also have to admit that they were sung by a wommun who would sound great singing the phone book. Lea still had a beautiful voice, even if she didn't sing the best songs. The highlights of the CD are probably ""We Could Be In Love"" and ""The Journey"". This was not a bad CD, but Lea has done better."
3,"Good, but should've been better","Ms Salonga is one of my favorite singers, but this album does not do her justice. She has better work on CD that is available in the Philippines but not in the US. I hope to hear more from Ms Salonga and hope to see her in a live performance someday. Thank you, Lea, for the joy your music has brought."
1,Disappointing!,"I love Lea's voice, but this CD is cheesy. She can't sing pop. Her voice is for Broadway only.The songs that are like (not love) are:It's Just GoodbyeThe JourneyWe Could Be in LoveI Honestly Love YouThe rest I just skip.Don't buy it. It's cheesy."
2,So-so for Miss Saigon!,"Lea Salonga deserves better material than this pap. Her choice of material is unenlightened. Very mediocre, forgettable songs. She has an almost flawless voice that is best suited to standards. When she tries to be Janet Jackson, she is at sea. How about an album of Broadway showtunes a la Streisand's ""Broadway Album""?"
1,Unknown starlet Tina Arenas in badly reviewed CD,Thank goodness Lea Salonga is not associated with this poorly reviewed Notre Dame de Paris outtake that obsessed Tina Arenas fan Derrick Lam with the dirty mind is so proud of.Ms. Salonga has accomplished more than enough with her extraordinary talents that wannabe-stars like Tina Arenas are but dirt on her feet.
3,I'd still get it...,"Lea Salonga has a beautiful voice. That is one thing for certain. A quiet set of songs from a formidable voice of Broadway, West End and Disney films (of course!), Lea delivers them wonderfully.If you love Lea's voice, it is certainly a nice CD to hear from her. I especially love to hear her cute duet with Brad Kane, who as you know sang with her in the Disney movie, Aladdin, and her own remake with Olivia Newton-John's hit, I Honestly Love You."
4,Not her best!,"I liked the song ""The Journey"" in this album. I likewise agree with the other reviewers that her voice really excels and shows when singing broadway songs. Unfortunately, no broadway songs in this album.However, Lea did release 2 broadway albums here in Manila (Lea Salonga, the Broadway Concert and Lea Salonga Live!) where she sang broadway and disney songs accompanied by an orchestra. These include songs such as ""Someone like You"" (Jekyll & Hyde), ""Someone else's Story"" (Chess), ""I Enjoy Being a Girl"" (Flower Drum Song), ""Where is Love/As long as he needs me"" (Oliver), ""Nothing"" (Chorus Line), ""You must love me"" (Evita), ""Something Wonderful/Being Alive (The King and I/Company), ""Go the Distance"" (Hercules), ""You'll be in my heart"" (Tarzan), ""Reflection"" (Mulan). Lea's rendition of these songs are ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!... These CDs are a must buy! American/British recording companies should be selling these because these are guaranteed top sellers!"
2,"Very Brief, Very Sketchy","Pilch's booklet on Bible translations is nothing more than a brief, cursory look at this intriguing subject, with some sketchy reviews of individual translations, done with a Roman Catholic perspective. For someone who is more in-depth with the subject, I'd suggest other references. For a beginner, this book covers the subject very nicely."
5,Son of Completely Satisfied,"Completely satisfied with the product, it is well constructed and perfect for my usage. It arrived promptly and I would not hesitate to use this vendor again."
5,Glory Glory,"any book that is written by Linda Lael Miller you will love, all of her books are great stories and you never want them to end!"
3,A Very Nice Book but Some Inacuracies,"This book is a really good reference. It includes a lot of information. Some section are a bit repetitive and make it look like the authors knew how to use the ""Cut and Paste"" function of their word processor.The book also contains some information that is no longer true (ie: the backingstore option) but that's to be expected when a project is under active development.In conclusion, this is a good book if you are really into making use of Wine to run your Windows application efficiently."
3,Living In A Lonely Room,"The book ""The Upstairs Room"" is about two young girls who are forced to live in the Oostervelds upstairs room to avoid being captured in WWII. The book showed what some Jews went through during the war, and gave me an insight to the lonely existence these two girls endured. I found this book very detailed and slow reading."
4,The Upstairs Room,"The Upstairs room, by Johanna Reiss, is a book about two sisters struggle through out the Holocaust. The two girls have to go into hiding to escape from the Natizs.They are separated from their family, and are not allowed to attend school . The two girls have to stay inside and in their room until it is safe . In my option this book in thrilling and captures your interest quickly. The Upstairs room is realistic fiction, and is at about and 8th grade reading level. Will the two sisters survive? Find out in , The Upstairs Room."
5,It was the BEST book i ever read!!,"THe Upstairs Room by Johanna Reiss, is the bet book I ever read. It is a historical-fiction story that won a Newbery Honor award because it teaches you a lesson. I think the lesson is to treat people the way you want to be treated. This book takes place in Holland during WWII. It is about a girl named Annie and her family who has to hide from the Germans. Annie is a ten-year-old girl who doesn't like the idea that the Nazis came to her town because now her friends won't talk to her. She is not aloud to go to school any more and she is not happy, all she wants to do is go for a long bike ride. The climax of the story was when the family had to go into hidding. When they were hidding they had to move from house to house, that made the story very suspenseful. YOu would never know if the Nazis would catch Annie's family. I also liked this book because it related to my own life (since the holocaust is part of my history)."
4,I loved this book,"This book was one of the nicest books I have read dealing with the Jews who had to hide during the war, and their thoughts and feelings. I have read Anne Frank many times over, and this was more captivating in a way, for it was targeted to the younger readers and placed in a story form. I would suggest this book to anyone who wants a clear view of the war through a child's frightened and uncertain eyes."
4,Well Built light,"The lights arrived well packaged and when I opened them I was impressed with the quality and appearence of the light. I would have gave 5 stars but I found the x shaped mount bracket to be a little difficult and have experienced better designs, but I would not hesitate to buy this light again, or highly recommend iut to anyone."
5,it's a very interesting book for kids,"The author of this book is a German doctor .In his day, thereare no books for kids reading specially. One day,he wanted to buy abook for his lovely daughtor as a christmas present, but he didn'tfind a suitable one .So he decided to ""create"" the book writing for kids specially. Every kid who had read the book loved it very much ,after he sent it to his daughtor . There is no except for me , after listening to my teacher telling the ten stories in this book. First time, I was shocked by the story , but in a short time I have love it. Sometimes you may be theatened by it , but it also satisfied you a craving. It is not like a creed to forbid childrens to do those thins most parents will be angry with, although the author himself is a father . I think this book will not only catch the children's heart but all the readers!"
2,Fair Quality,"Fair quality reproduction. Looks like scanned and photo copied pages, one-sided. I do like that it is in Engllish because most editions are in German. Seems like someone could do a better job of reproducing this classic. Anyone with German roots should have a copy as this was about as popular as Mother Goose or Grimm's. Every German I know has a memory of one of these stories from their youth."
2,missing pages,I was absolutely delighted to find this book and so disappointed when I found that the end to Paulinchen (die Feuerzeug Geschichte) is missing. Please correct this. Thank you.
3,"Good, but not ""Relic"" good","I will freely admit that my review of this novel is colored in large part by my opinion of Relic. This novel is by no means bad, but after having read ""Relic"", and therefore knowing what Preston and Child are capable of, I feel it could have been better.The characters are drawn in rather broad strokes, and I never felt particularly drawn to any of them. Furthermore, the story, while intriguing, is not exactly edge of your seat stuff.That said, the writing is excellent. In particular, Preston and Child exhibit excellent descriptive writing ability, and a knack for setting the mood.All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed this book, but I wouldn't make it the first Preston/Child novel you read."
5,Very exciting medical thriller,"This book is very, very cool. It was hard to put it down, because I just wanted to know whether all would end up in a world-wide epidemic or not. I think that anyone who enjoyed 'Outbreak' or 'the Hot Zone' by Richard Preston will love this book."
2,Poorly edited,"Just started reading the Kindle edition. This book is so poorly edited with spelling errors that it makes it a difficult read. For example Im is converted to pm instead of I'm throughout the book, words run together and extra letters in words. Very disappointing."
3,"A good read, but not much else.","I read thier first one, Relic, which I thought was an interesting premise. Unfortunately, I think they wrote a computer program to generate these plots and it makes it hard differentiate.My main problem with it is the characterizations are thin. I know, I know... so are most of the books out there. Most people think that biographical information is the equivalent of deep characters, but its not and that's sort of what we get here. Lots of information about people, some very interesting, but the plot is king here, not the people.Bottom line: You'll love this if you like plot-driven, high-concept stories with scientific information copied directly out of research papers, where the characters act and react according to the story's needs. Otherwise you probably will struggle to get through it, wondering why half the character exist at all and why the book is so long."
1,There should be a zero star rating,"I have never read anything by these authors but I bought this book because of their rave reviews.Well either it's me or it's their style of writing but I'm at page 327, I'm still bored, and trying my best to just finish the darn book.I also bought their book Thunderhead and will give that a try even with my current bad experience.I wish my review wasn't negative, but it is what it is. Personally, I would not recommend reading this even if someone gave it to you for free."
4,No episode missing,"I have the DVD of Mysteries of Asia. There are two DVD's in the package. The first one contains two episodes, Jewels of the Jungle and Secrets of the Great Wall. The second one contains the episode Lost Temples of India. Three episodes in total as stated in the cover."
2,Missing episode,Where is the third one: The lost Temples of India ? That was the most interesting of the three (and it is rare to find a documentary on the numerous temples of India that the west knows so little about). Why does the dvd contain only 2 (angor vat and china wall) out of the three episodes that the 3 part mini series originally came with when it was first shown on TLC ? Where is the 'Lost Temples of India' ?? Disappointing !
3,This is incorrect information!,"According to my existing Makita blade with No. 721107-6A. this is a 20mm arbor...not a 5/8"". 20mm converted to inches is .79 inches which is greater than 3/4 inches which is also greater than 5/8 inches. So if your arbor is 20mm and this blade indeed is 5/8"", this blade will not fit your saw. Either this site has posted the incorrect part number, listed the arbor size incorrectly or doesn't know how to convert milimeters to inches."
1,"Really boring, both lyrics and melody","Another highly overrated song, almost as bad as ""F**k it"". The lyrics and the melody are really boring, the video makes me aggressive. There's many other R&B and HipHop songs, and most of them so much better, classics like Hi-Tek's Round&Round or of the more recent tracks, even Chingy's One Call Away is way more enjoyable."
3,Good songs with real bad sound,"The album sounds like playing in a garage or a room without reverb effect. Is strange because they have all technology to record in the studio, but they choose to record with this poor sound. For example, the guitar is always on the rigt, bass on the left and drums and voice in the center, you listen the guitar in second place including the guitar solo part. Nuno playing in this CD is so bluesy for me, but there are flashes of his hyper velocity and masterfull technique, like in Midnigth Express, an acoustic guitar solo impossible for anyone, i think.The songs are very good and voices too, but the rare kind of sound recorded brings they down."
1,"big Extreme fan, but this album is AWFUL","I am a big fan of Extreme (esp. of Nuno's guitar playing and Gary's singing) and I thouroughly enjoyed all their albums prior to this one, there are truly wonderful pieces on every one of them. However, ""Waiting for the Punchline"" is very boring and rough-sounding, seems to be played by a bunch of kids in a not-so-well-equipped garage. I bought the album right after it came out (a long time ago), and sold it at a loss soon afterwards: the last drop was the last song, Unconditionally, which is probably the best song on the album, but so corny, protracted, and unpolished that I couldn't take it anymore. I do not recommend this album, thank goodness it is an old one (I have yet to listen to their latest album, Saudades de Rock, but I am not very motivated anymore, the samples I heard on Amazon remind me - quite unfortunately - of Waiting for the Punchline)."
1,Awful!,"Don't even spend the $... to buy a used copy. This is very unlike their other records. Guess they were listening to too much grunge, because it's very dark, depressing, and quite a downer. Nuno's awesome guitar playing seems to have gotten lost somewhere, too.These guys used to be upbeat and full of energy. This isn't either of those. Stay away if you like Pornografitti, you'll find nothing like that here."
2,hmm,"dnt get me wrong, luda can rip the mic with the best of them. dude has talent. but he cant make a good cd for the life of him. i dont know what it is, he can make a sick song and tear it up (the potion) and then put together a mix of some of the worst songs ever. i give him 2 stars only b.c the potion is out of control."
4,DetroitFinest,"This album is great i like it. For the Luda fans buy it Dirty South always drops tight albums. I like all the tracks but some of the favorite ones are..""Put Your Money Up"" DMX on this one damn its tight""Child Of The Night"" any track that nate dogg on u got to like""Who Not Me"" i really like the beat""Two Miles An Hour"" this track tite no doubt""Hopeless"" trick daddy on it this track is something different"
2,i dont know why...????,"i dont know why...but some rappers are just better featuring on other artist tracks and luda is oone of them....i mean...he ripped on ushers ""yeah!"" and on a couple of others like ""sugar (gimme some)""(for those of you that only have seen the video...they cut out luda's verse and they put in lil kims) i mean...his part is the best pat of the whole song , but he just cant carry a whole album on his own...now im not saying that there arent any good tracks on here....theres a couple or more but more than half is terrible, the only good songs are ""the potion"" ""get back"" ""number one spot"" and ""child of the night"" and 2 of those are his singles(unless you count the potion at the end of number one spot video as a single...but....i dont)....just another rap album that will go 3x platinum for absolutely nothing.....move on....dont buy it unless you are a HUGE fan...get ""word of mouf""....now thats his good album...."
2,Thou hath purchased this album? Thou hath wasted $$$$,"If we view Rap music as a type of social disease, or plague that is inundating our society, we must view Ludacris as one of the main or primary individuals who is spreading this sickness throughout our communities. What Luda and those of his ilk fail to realize is that rap is not a true form of music, but rather a collection of annoying noises with words. Rap is neither music nor poetry; rather, it is an epidemic that is destroying the moral fabric of society!"
2,average at best,"Luda has some songs I dig but as far as Albums go he can't carry a whole album to me.He is like the Musical Offspring of Busta Rhymes&Missy Elliott in that He has alot of what I like to call Energy type of music making.it's cool at the clubs but after a while everything runs into one.now if He drops a Greatest Hits set then He will have something worth grooving to more than half way through.I respect His flow&Hustle,but His routine don't change at all.He found His Formula&it works."
3,Why is Ludachris so mad?,"I love the current state of radio in that I get all of my favorite songs played every hour so I never stop hearing them. So I hear, ""Get Back"" by Loodakwis and he's talking about how he is going to beat up somebody. Why? I have a big problem with hip hop culture right now in that it portrays women pretty much as strippers who just need to dance up on their man, who needs to be a soljah. Why all the violence? I'm a big fan of old school rap like Whodini, Twinkie T and EPMD. They didn't constantly talk about beating up people and degrading women and they were seven point eight times the rappers that Lewdachris is. I just don't like the way things are going and I think we're in for trouble unless things get back to the way they were when Dj Jazzy Jeff and Fresh Prince owned the rap game. Out."
1,Someone this wack - The Hip-Hop Artist of the Year,"Wack, wack, wack, wack & more wack.Can't believe this guy got Hip-Hop Artist of the Year.The Source are kidding themselves.[...]Red Light District doesn't even sound like Hip-Hop.It sounds like a porn movie..."
1,Stupid and funny looking,I saw the cover of this cd and laughed so hard. This guy looks like is about to have his @## kicked! Seriously how can anyone listen to this trash? Rap is dead people. Imagine being an adult and admitting you listened to this? So sad.....
1,i would have liked to give this 0 stars but i cant,"rap is such bad music its not even funny...they dont have good lyrics they dont have good drum beats they dont know how to talk unless you call ""yeah"" ""yo"" ""oh yeah"" ""oh yo"" ""f*ck"" ""sh*t"" and other swears i dont even want to bleep......basically its just wrong to listen to this....."
3,"Dude, it's a hat - are you seriously reading reviews about a hat?","This hat is just ok. I bought it as a cheaper alternative to another brand, and wish I hadn't. It gets the job done, so if you need a (spare) hat to keep your head from crispification and burnination in the shadeless parts of the planet you won't regret parting with your cash. But there are better, softer, more packable, better coverage hats out there (yes, they run $35 instead of $14 to $20)."
4,OK,I believed I was ordering a gift hat in peach color but it arrived khaki colored. I stuck a broach on the front and I hope the gift will be well received.
5,Dorky but practical,"Yes it looks dorky. Yes, you do get funny looks when wearing it.But when you're on camel safari or hiking in the desert, who cares.It keeps you from getting sunburned. The material is actually 2 layers of nylon, so it really does a nice job of keeping the sun out. Much better than my previous sun hat, which was an Outdoor Research Sun Runner cap -- that was thinner. This hat also packs easily and the brim holds its shape, but the darker tan color doesn't show dust and grime as quickly. It has 2 strings hanging off the back -- one to adjust the size, and the other apparently to clip to your shirt to keep it from blowing away in high winds (I actually lost a hat on a boat that way once).If you're sun-sensitive or skin-health conscious, this is a great choice. But if you're fashion conscious and not into funky hats, this may not be your cup of tea."
5,Good Hat,"I wore this hat fishing with my husband deep sea fishing and loved it. My only tiny gripe is that i wish the brim on the sides was not quite so wide, but otherwise it's a great with good ventilation. Love the collar clip."
3,Good value for the price,"Got this one for the 12-mile hiking at Tongariro Crossing in New Zealand. It did the job well, protecting me from both the sun and the drizilling rain. Wish the flap in the back bigger for better coverage. But for the price, it's a good buy."
5,Amilia (California Diaries),"This book is Hip and in style. If you don't really like to read but you love stories, this is the series for you. This is no fiction book, this stuff happens every day. So if you are instreted to know what it is about, buy the whole series."
5,"This book was about amalias boyfriend,james, bossing her.",At the beginning of the book Amalia was hating her sister and james was sweet.But then Amalia started going to a shelter and was attached to that.James got jealous and finally they broke up.
4,Great unit...well built. Fast delivery!,"This is a very well built unit with many accessories available to expand functionality....light, extra magnifier, etc. The unit is made of quality materials, and the vendor shipped the unit quickly."
4,Good Product,"This swing has been an asset. Only problem are the push buttons for music and timer. Our 5 yr has broken the timer button by pushing it all the way in, and now it doesn't function. This happened the first week we received the swing."
4,"Nice, but not outstanding","We like the features on this swing. The multiple speed settings, two seat postions, music, timer, etc. It definately swaddles the baby. Our son (7 weeks old) likes it ok. He prefers to be held, but he will sleep and sometimes be content in the swing. We will see how he does as he gets a little older and more confident on his own. For now, we feel 4 stars is fair."
5,Great review,"The Boppy Rock swing is great, and just what we needed. It is compact and fits into small spaces. I love that when you touch the baby it stops swinging and when you get finished it resumes speed just the way it was set. Its very soft and comfy, and I love the critters hanging on the crossbar, which are also removable. It's easy to work with and out granddaughter loves it."
2,not that great,"here are the good things about this swing - the batteries last really long, the range of motion is nice and my daughter loves it - it took her some time to enjoy the motion, about 2 months, now at 4 months she is starting to get over it..the bad stuff - the music didn't work from day one, it was too late for us to return it so we just kept it. Also, the corners of the legs have a padding - I guess anti-slip, that broke off after 2 weeks of having the swing on the carpet.. it does fold up quite nicely but whenever we fold it the seat gets out of the aligment and we have to redo it. Every time. Otherwise she is practically falling out of it. I would probably not choose it again and would not recommend it to my friends. We also own a bouncy seat from Boppy and absolutely love it!"
2,My son didnt like it,We had to send it back cause my 2mo son didnt like beeing in this swing.it looks great but just my son looked uncomfortable and began to cry every time i put him in this swing.the only thing i dont like about it is an adjustment of seat. it can be either fully reclined or fully straight which is not suitable for a such a little kid.My son likes to be in partly seat position. may thats why he doesnt like this swing. Otherwise its very cute.
3,Company will replace for free!,"I purchased the Boppy Rock in Comfort Travel Swing because of it's ease of portability, small size and color options.I was however very disapointed when after three months of use the motor failed. My baby LOVES this swing and it is perfect for when I have to take her to work with me or on outings.I called the store where I purchased it and was told that after 90 days I was inelligable for a return or exchange so I called Boppy directly. I was pleased to hear that they would replace the swing at no cost and shipped via priority mail the very next day.I rated the swing a 3 because while the customer service was excellent, I was miffed that the motor failed after on 3 months of irregular use."
1,Three Stooges fans don't bother!!,Looking back over the reviews and the Product Description I feel I was misled that these were short stories about Moe Howard and / or the Three Stooges and some behind the scenes memoirs. NOTHING to do with Moe or the Stooges except as the title of one of the short stories in which the author had a fantasy about being a Stooge. LAME!!
5,Great Mini-Keyboard,"If you want the smallest footprint keyboard, don't need a separate number pad off to the side, this is a super choice. [There is a superimposed number pad which can be engaged.]The Glidepoint Touchpad works beautifully, and accepts taps in lieu of button presses, but also has the buttons below, on the forward edge of the keyboard.There are built-in rear legs to elevate/slant the keyboard slightly and a nice forward extension on which to rest your wrists.Keyboard feel is adequate, and frankly there is nothing I miss about my huge-o HP ergonomic maxi-keyboard which crowded my desktop unnecessarily."
5,smells great,man i am telling you...if you are in a slump this will get you out of one in a hurry.....women all day long tell me they love this cologne....ALL DAY LONG.Even YOUR girl likes it ........
4,Van the Man's best since the 70's,"After seeing Van the Man with Dylan at Madison Square Garden in 1998, I had to go out an buy this CD. It has grown on me with every listen and inspired me to check out other Morrison CDs. A terrific CD with Van singing his heart out. A must have for all Morrison fans."
4,van is like wine,he ages so gracefully the healing game is a great song for a decent album hes 52 here and can still sing what's in his guinness
5,"Van hits the spot, again","As a long time Van fan, I think this is one of his best for quiet a while.My favourite tracks are ""Burning Ground"", ""It Once Was My Life"",and ""Wind in the Willows"".The latter song is in the Van mellow mood such as ""Autumn Song"",and I'm glad he can still produce such songs.Pee Wee Ellis is great, as usual, on sax, and Brian Kennedy's vocals blend well with Van's.I was disappointed with Days Like This, but this album has restored my faith in the man;it shows that he's still got the fire in the belly and the spark of inspiration."
2,Damage,This book is very disturbing. It is written without emotion and very depressing. I really cannot recommend this book for at least in my opinion it is not something that I would have chosen to read had I totally realized how dark it was.
1,If Only There Were Negative Numbers,"One of the worst books I've ever read. I can only be thankful it was one of the shortest as well. This was a senseless death of trees. I can't think of enough words to use to describe how horrible, stupid, bad, lunk-headed and terrible this book is."
4,Excellent first novel,Ms. Hart's first novel is a well-written and insightful description of a man's infidelity that leads from deception to obsession. What stands out most in mind is the opening of the book and the poetic way it leads in to the story as well as the overpowering and somewhat bizarre relationship that the main character and his lover share.
3,Happy sledding,"Made to last and provide you with lots of fun. However, the cold weather causes it to appear underinflated or containing a slow leak; something not seen in their Airslider. Another problem I didn't experience with the Airslider is control. Unlike the Airslider in which you have total control, this sled puts you at the mercy of your surroundings. However, if wild adventures is what you crave for, then this is your sled. Happy sledding........"
5,great experiance,"I am very grateful for the professional treatment, proper shipping, perfect packaging and detailed paperwork. I highly recomend this dealer.Ursula"
3,Generic Memory,"I wanted a specific Kingston part number (KTD4400/512). Amazon search lead me to believe the memory I was ordering was that part number. It was the generic KVR replacement for that part number. I keep the memory because I can use it in another computer, but had to buy the memory I wanted somewhere else. I will avoid ordering memory from Amazon in the future."
1,Item is not in original packing,Bought this items from Arch Memory through Amazon. Item is not packed with original packing like NEW one. It just sealed with a plastic bag. The ram module got some chinese word label which is weird enough and make me believe it is used and i doubt is it really a kingston ram module. If it is new it should come with a memory plastic box and with lifetime warranty from kingston. Although everything is working well. But Used items sold with NEW price which it really unfair to customer. Feel like cheated using new price to buy an used product.
5,something to enjoy,"I have been fortunate enough to have owned this wonderful recording since it was released many years ago. I wanted to share this great music with friends and was very pleased to find it on AMAZON. These are timeless songs that one can really relate to concerning LOVE's ups-n-downs. Open your heart and sing your favorites. Every SHA LA LA LA, every song is inspiring...SOOOO FINE.."
3,The novelty wears thin,"There are some amazing bands on this album, but after a while, the novelty of today's groups doing covers of the Carpenters' songs wears thin. I love Sonic Youth doing ""Superstar,"" but for true camp value, listen to the original. Cracker's ""Rainy Days and Mondays"" is a mockery although Sheryl Crow's ""Solitare"" does do some justice to Karen Carpenter. The Carpenters are so far out that they're cool again, and I think you'd be better off picking up one of the original albums."
2,HMMM...,"If you are fans of the artists on this album, you may have a more positive opinion of it, but I really didn't like any of it accept for ""Calling Occupants of Interplanetary Craft."" I actually thought that one had a pretty interesting sound to it and it worked really well. I thought the rest of the songs lacked the emotion and melodic beauty the real Carpenters had. ""Top of the World"" was especially painful to me."
4,Great,Great CD. Had it when it came out years ago - loaned it out- and now I've had to replace it cause it never made it's way back to me. Love it.
2,"cute, but poor quality","My daughter loves the design. The sheets, however, are so thin that you can literally see right through them!"
5,Waltons movie,Very pleased with the purchase of the Walton video. Just what I had wanted and couldn't find anywhere else. It was a great gift and a real surprise for my husband.
5,The Homecoming: A Christmas Story,I have loved this movie ever since I first saw it. I will watch it when the Christmas Season arrives. Thanks so much. Happy Holidays a head.
5,Great Movie,"I remember this from my childhood. It is a little slow, but it is full of valuable content. It is interesting watching it again as an adult. I definitely would recommend this to any family looking for substance during the holidays."
5,An excellent Christmas classic.,"For those you would like to know how Christmas was celebrated during the depression see this movie. The story or writing isn't the only great thing about this fillm. The acting to this film, the prequel to the Walton TV show is outstanding in every role. Film was Patricia Neal's comeback after suffering a stroke."
4,Wonderfully homey,"This is one of my favorite Christmas stories, since it reminds me of my childhood. I miss the original Walton's cast though. Such a heart warmer."
5,"Best Christmas Story, since the first",It is all about family. Watch it every year.Fantastic acting. Great story. Launched the iconic series.
5,LOVED IT,"I GREW UP WATCHING THE WALTONS I ENJOYED WATCHING THIS WITH MY FAMILY! I CHOSE A 5 STAR RATING DUE TO QUALITY, PACKAGING, PERFECT CONDITION. AMAZON I AM SO HAPPY YOUR MERCHANDISE IS ALWAYS THE BEST QUALITY!! THANK YOU"
4,Heartwarming,"We watched this movie last week for our family movie night. I remember the series ""The Waltons"". This movie was the begining. The movie was heartwarming and family friendly. It was made in 1971 so it may seem a little corney by todays standards. But, we all enjoyed it."
3,Just Not the Same,"I love the series. We rented this to watch for Christmas and made it through the first 15 minutes or so. The characters are so different. The loving Mrs. Walton from the series being played by Patricia Neal, comes across as a chain smoking crank. She just does NOT fit the Mrs. Walton we all have come to know and love. I would rent before buying to make sure the change in characters is something you can deal with."
2,Waltons had to start somewhere,I missed the movie when it started and wound up comparing it to the series. The series characters grew up with me and have been like family. I felt the original cast payed the parts in a much harsher attitude but it was interesting and made me appreciate the way the series handled the family situations.
5,This IS the real thing!,"Music that sound just as fresh as it did in the 60's. This compilation has (almost) all of the Small Faces Decca recordings, and they sound incredible! Great rock'n'roll/R&B music. Buy this album, you won't be able to sit still..."
2,yikes! what happened here?,"okay, you'd think with big name actors (sarandon, hoffman) a movie would be better...but it's not. hoffman gets the over-acting lifetime achievement award anyway, but in this particular film it is so over the top that it is painful to watch. sarandon seems to be positioned as the only voice of [angry], sacrosanct ""reason,"" which is unfortunate because it makes her public persona seem a bit inauthentic, as though it came from this character sketch. gyllenhall is just not interesting as the wimpy dude--his falling in love with the bartender just seemed too cliche to believe and it was just way too much melodrama overall. i gave it two stars for the barfing dog scene...otherwise it would have scored just one."
5,Beautiful movie,"I agree with the other poster, this should have gained a better recognition. I had never heard of it until today, I happened to catch it on tv, unfortunate because I had to deal with commercials. A sad movie but excellent acting, a lot of familiar faces and a wonderful story. Will own this soon."
3,the best actress in the movie gets no credits?,"This movie is a Susan Sarandon production:the female lead playing Bertie (Ellen Pompeo) is so very good and is no where found on the cover.Since she went on to star in as a famous medical intern(playing the title role of Meredith Grey on the ABC medical drama Grey's Anatomy.),that just doesn't seem fair?All the acting is first rate here:one of the best recent hollywood filmsthat isn't an action thriller.The acting is good and the movie is a tear jerkerso that I call it a chick flick over a simple drama.The idea is that a man kills the fiancée of Joe Nast in a cafeacross the street from her Dad's real estate office.He had actually broken it off three days before, but she hadn't told her parents, so he is ""trapped""being the future son in law until the murder trial is over.Holly Hunter is also very good, but only a bit role.I actually liked the film, but can't give the system that ignores a future star high marks in my review."
5,love this hamper!,"Love this hamper, it really completes the room. I actually exchanged the first one I bought for another b/c I wanted the buttons to show the floral print & the first one had just the cream print on."
4,"Custer not the ""genocidal butcher"" too often portrayed","Although I have some serious problems with Kraft's assertion that Custer and Meotzi were lovers (a ""fact"" that has never been established beyond reasonable doubt), his book does present Custer the cautious commander, *negotiating* with Indians and avoiding bloodshed with same even at the cost of some of his men's admiration."
1,Terrible game,"i bought the game fosters home for imaginary friends for my 6 year old daughter. its rated for 5-8 and K-2 grades. We did not even make it to the actual games. the opening cartoons were terrible displaying behaviors that i punish my children for, i.e. temper tantrums, taking things away from others, and being rude. it also used language we do not allow in our house,i.e. shut up and stupid. the game was terrible avoid it!"
5,She gets it.,Giele is offering the best explanation going of why the suffrage movement succeeded when it did by highlighting the two strong bases for women's suffrage and showing the degree to which they diverged outside of this issue. She brings together scholarship arguing for one side of the other and convincingly argues that both were necessary to success. An important work.
5,Great Series,"The main character, Billy Boyle, is likeable guy who has an enduring way of getting information and getting everyone around him to like him....except for the ones who shoot at him!His Irish Boston, wiseguy attitude is balanced well with a detailed oriented investigator instinct that makes every minute of this book enjoyable. He is guy who always seems to figure out what is going on based on his family and his life experiences as well as his sharp intellect. The bonus is you will learn some history along the way.I started with this book and have read my way through another 4 books in the series enjoying each and every one tremendously! Try this book and you, too will become a fan of this mystery writer.Amazon doesn't do a good job telling you which book in next in the series, so check publishing dates. His books seem to come out in the month of September each year.Enjoy!"
2,Needs work,"I loved the premise of the story of a relatively new detective from Boston who has used his family connections to rise rapidly in status in both the police department and in the Army and is forced to solve a murder in England. Unfortunately, the back-story was ultimately much more interesting than the plot. I think if he could have pulled it off, James Benn was really onto something. However, the author fails to generate either much suspense or interest in any of the characters except detective Boyle and even he starts to wear on the reader after a while with his seemingly random personality shifts between a naive, unsure investigator and a seasoned pro. This was a free download but it did not entice me to want to read more in the series. I would suggest to authors that are considering giving away a book in a series to generate more sales that you select one of the better ones."
3,Enjoyable,"Billy Boyle is an Irish lad from South Boston who is a fledgeling Boston Detective. He also happens to be the nephew of General Eisenhower. His family pulls in a few favors and get him assigned under ""Uncle Ike's"" supervision. Uncle Ike needs someone he can trust to ensure that crime among the troops does not interfere with his war plans in Europe.His first assignment is to sniff out a suspected spy. A murder on the base quickly causes complications and Billy is tasked with unraveling a web of murder, betrayal, international politics and diplomacy.Overall, the story was enjoyable and easy to read. I like the idea of expanding history with fictional ideas such as this. There are millions of untold stories from anyone involved in WW II. While most do not appear in history books, stories like this remind us of the countless heroes of the time."
3,A Boston Detective on General Ike's Staff,The first in a series yields a promising start. Having a young detective and relative of Ike's investigating crime in a time of war is a fine premise. Boyle comes from a family who has a history of both war and police service. The year is 1942 and Boyle finds himself in London shortly after joining the army. Soon as he arrives he is investigating the death of an official of the Norwegian government in exile. This first installment is somewhat simple and cartoonish but entertaining. I wonder if the author is striving for the period's melodrama or if he is just finding his legs (the book's cover art is excellent but summons up a Hardy Boys type of flavor). I plan to find out where Benn takes Boyle by reading the subsequent works. I hope the series and Boyle grow a little more gritty along the lines of Kerr's Bernie Gunther and more nuanced like Airth's Madden.
3,"""I Like Ike"" were among my first words as a child","So I adored the premise of this story of our hero, Billy, being Ike's nephew. I loved Billy's humility and humor. Thanks for the Kindle freebie. I will buy the rest of this series if and when available."
3,Love's Old Country Music,This Collection is OK but it is miss three songs. One of the VERY BEST song he ever did BEER AND BONES is not on here. The other two are COWBOY LOVE and I MISS YOU A LITTLE. They can be found on his GH.
3,Cute but super hot!,This outfit was cute but was super hot. I live in FL and my son wound up only wearing it to one house and then walking around in tshirt and shorts for the rest. It is very thick material. Make sure you are in a cold place if you need this costume.
3,"Note: ADULT, but not historically accurate","I wish I had known this book was really R+ (or X?) rated, rather than just believing it was a bodice-ripper novel, from the vague cover and spicy but not R-rated sample text. It's not that I would not have purchased, just that I should have known. Book rates itself honestly on the inside cover... which doesn't help by the time it's purchased.Having said that, story was entertaining, tho not artfully written. It was basically literary porn, with love interest, which is not a bad thing.The historical accuracy is flawed.Entertaining, but the story did not do much for me."
5,WOW,I love this book. My girlfriend bought itbecause she loves all things Bowie.It's a great ROCK book. The photographs are outstanding.Perfect for this music fan.
2,Arty or out of focus?,"I have to say that after all the hype I was very disappointed when I got my copy of this book. I have expected a fascinating glimpse of Bowie backstage. Instead I got a book with a load of out of focus pictures which, as an amateur photgrapher myself, I would have been too embarassed to publish. Maybe they are supposed to be arty, but they do nothing whatsoever for me. Come to think of it, if I got together all the out of focus shots I've taken of Bowie I might have a book of my own to publish. Anyone interested?"
5,A Touching Story,"Jean Craighead George really put a lot of effort into this book. It seems so realistic, I had to read the Author's Note to know most of the characters were fictional. It is a heartwarming story about Frightful, the peregene falcon that Sam trains. Sam is a very simple person who is very fond of animals like I am. This book is worth reading-most definetly."
1,Not what I had in mind,Very good on the illustrations....not good on the text to explain why certain methods of dress were worn. I bought this to do a paper on the history of fashion in the Middle Ages....This is not the book for the subject.
2,The good and the bad,"OK, I will admit it, I am a Bruce Johnston closet fan. Now having said that, stick with ""Going Public"" it's full of the hooks and sappy balled writing that we have come to love. By the way If I just reviewed Going Public I would have given it three stars."
4,A Sociological work,"This is the first and only book of it's kind. Originally a German sociological work from the 60's, it still holds up. The origin of the mafioso and how he differs from various ""other state actors"" is the most compelling part. Hess delivers his work without moralizing the mafioso, but changes a little as the book goes on. I don't know if he is trying to be objective or if he suffers from literary Stockholm syndrome. A very unique read."
5,I don't know if kids like it but my mom does,"I bought this as a present to go along with an actual Chinese dragon kite I gave to my mother. She collects children's books, and although she was not familiar with author or artist she enjoyed it very much, and has now started looking for his other books. It came quickly and in the stated condition, first edition signed. Excellent transaction overall. Would do business again with this company."
1,Full of Gluten!,"I really wish I never bought this book! I was excited to finally find a book with that didn't use eggs, casein, or gluten and ready to make something edible. Every baking recipe uses barley or spelt flour (which contain gluten). I should have never assumed that Wheat Free meant Gluten Free. My mistake! Live and learn i guess. I now have to look for gluten free vegan books to find recipes that my son can eat. The gluten free vegan is a good book, and I am really excited about BabyCakes Covers the Classics! It is a gluten free vegan baking book that uses mostly Bob's red mill mixes, because it is a pain in the butt (and really expensive) to have to buy 20 different flours and mix them together to make something that isn't even edible!"
1,WARNING This book may be dangerous for allergic people,"While the intentions of this book may be sincerely well meant, this book could be extremely dangerous to those with sensitive allergies. Many of the products are cross-contaminated and could be very dangerous to allergic people. My son has reacted to some of her recommendations due to the cross-contaminations. The book should of been reviewed in detail for medical accuracy since allergies can be life threatening. With all of the confusion due to the differing severity of allergic reactions this book misleads as to the safety of these products and recipes."
3,Better than decent,"Some good resources and recipes. My issue is multiple allergies so while a recipe might be dairy free or gluten free, there are very few combination recipes. This means a lot of substitutions, which for my money, I can do on my own with recipes from online."
2,Not Allergen-Free. Deceived once again.,"Deceived once again.This book is not allergen-free. There are many recipes that include spelt. On a wheat-free diet, spelt was on the first ""forbidden food"" list I ever received.The book, like many others claiming to be allergen-free, suggests substitutes. But if the substitutes taste as good, why include the wheat? (Because obviously the substitutes aren't as good.) But conveniently, the book advertises itself as allergen free, to get people to buy it.To falsely advertise a book as one thing, when it is something else, is just plain wrong."
2,The whole food allergy cookbook,Ill conceived twaddle. I suffer from corn allergies and recipes in the book contain corn. Do not have much faith in the rest of it which are old household recipes.
3,I buy too many books!,"I buy too many books... I think this looks like a pretty good one, I need to spend more time going through it..."
4,good simple recipes,"This is a good cookbook w/ simple to follow recipes and ingredients. However, anything that contains flour is still a gluten flour.I have done enough research at this point to know that I can substitute the gluten flour for a combo of gluten free flours. She does give alternatives but they are still not gluten free. Gluten is one of the biggest food allergies there is. All in all, I like the book. It is a starting point and I alter the recipes as I see fit for my family."
2,NOT GLUTEN-FREE,"There are other great books out there that explore eating healthy whole foods that are gluten and dairy-free. This book is unfortunately not gluten-free. I have 2 sons with ADHD who are on the GF / CF diet. I was hoping this book would provide some new recipes for our family - there are some that we have found - but most of them take a while to prepare. Two of my favorite books areThe Gluten-Free Vegan: 150 Delicious Gluten-Free, Animal-Free RecipesandThe Whole Life Nutrition Cookbook: Whole Foods Recipes for Personal and Planetary Health. Both books have tons of healthy recipes that are gluten, dairy, and egg-free!"
3,fair,"The John Wayne movie based on this book is a favorite, so perhaps my expectations were unjustly high. I was somewhat disappointed in the book. The story moves along well enough and there was pretty good character development. The book fails to take advantage of decriptive language of the remarkable geography of the setting. The story line with the prosititutes was lacking credibility and seemed out of place with the main story line, a distraction. The revenge of the boys against the outlaws was cold-blooded and calculating. I could see the kids rising up in the heat of the moment to exact vengenace, but I didn't buy the story line here. There was unnecessarily descriptive language tinged with a sprinkle of homoeroticism. I found that disturbing, too. In this case, the movie was much better than the book."
5,like winter's freeze and summer's thaw....,"This album gets 5 stars because of ""I Was Brought To My Senses."" Even if every other song on the album was completely awful, this one brings everything to redemption. It contains lines from Tennyson and multiple images from nature and history, and is one of the most beautiful poems he ever wrote.But it gets better...some of the other songs are good, too! ""The Hounds of Winter"" has some neat background rhythms. I didn't especially like ""All Four Seasons"" until I found out he had written it for his youngest daughter--""that's my baby, she can be all four seasons in one day""--and after that I loved it; it all clicked into place. ""Let Your Soul Be Your Pilot"" and ""Lithium Sunset"" and ""Valparaiso"" are great as well. Also, the singles from this album have GORGEOUS B-sides. Worth the listen!"
1,Hated it! Sorry!,"This is by far Sting's worst album. No wonder it flopped: There are no good songs on this album and it's a shame considering how he came off with the dynamite ""Ten Sumner's Tales"" from three years earlier. ""I'm So Happy I Can't Stop Crying"" is just drab and without wit. The same can be said about the rest of this album. Sorry Sting! He is a great musician but this wasn't his year. HOwever his next two albums since then are absolutely phenomenal!"
2,Sting's worst,"I've always been a BIG Sting fan but this one is his worst. 1985's Dream of the Blue Turtles has powerful songs as does 1987's Nothing but the Sun. They both have songs about all kinds of subject matter. Sting himself, on MTV's unplugged, even said he likes to take his music from every subject. 1991's Soul Cages even shows that. 1995's Ten summoner's Tales is even really good. But unfortunately, this one is a flop. Most of the songs are about lost loves. I've heard of artist's selling out to pop, but he has sold out to crap this time. I hope to see him get creative again in the future."
3,the disc is Nothing Like the Sting I love,"I bought Nothing Like the Sun the day it was released and was pleased it was every bit as good as Turtles. So, I've bought every disc of his since, hoping it will be as good as those first two. They're getting progressively worse. I'm not suggesting that his brilliant songwriting should stick to a formula, but this just ain't it. I find myself leaving this one on the shelf and picking up ""Turtles"" or ""Nothing Like"" instead."
5,Great read for those wanting more out of the backcountry!,"Great book with useful information for those wanting a little more out of their trips in backcountry of CA. Most of the book concentrates on The Sierras, which for me is a good thing. This book gives all the usefull information needed for making you trips a success. The book covers all the basics, but also touches upon going light, and proper nutrition which most guide books don't touch upon. Alot of the treks in this book has cross-country variations as well as side trips that will make your trips more interesting than the average trail type trek. The photos in this book are outstanding, and the easy nature that Paul writes makes the book very enjoyable to read. I will be using this book on many backpacking, oooppsss I mean trekking journeys this summer and many more to come. Buy it!"
3,Ten Sumner Tails :),"In this album Sting continues to show his musical talent, even though it does not match up to ""Nothing Like the Sun"" or ""The Dream of the Blue Turtles."" My favorite song of this album is ""Shape of My Heart."" The rest of the album is also good, but Sting showed us in ""Nothing Like the Sun"" and in ""Mercury Falling"" he could do better."
2,Probably Sting's worst,"I know this is contrary to what the reviewers are saying, but I didn't like the direction Sting took on this record. Most of the songs are slow, boring pop, with none of the jazz, raggae or new wave influences that made his earlier work interesting. The whole album is made very unpleasant by the chromatic harmonica that is laced troughout most of the songs. Maybe some people like the sound, but I found it to be awfully annoying.There are two good songs on this CD, but they aren't the two hits. If you think that the song ""If Ever I Lose My Faith In You' is a great song, then this is the CD for you. Most of the rest of the material is along those same lines. Otherwise, stick to the earlier ablum like ""Dream of The Blue Turtles""."
5,Sting in DTS is Wonderful,"This version of ""Ten Summoners Tales"" is a must have for Sting fans owning a DTS decoder! Voices and instruments are crisp, use of surround effects is well done. As with all DTS audio CD's having good quality, evenly matched speakers is very important to the reproduction, but when it's done correctly there is nothing quite like hearing Sting slide across the room singing ""Saint Augustine In Hell"" or ""Fields Of Gold"". You must have a DTS decoder to play this CD and use a digital connection from player to amp/reciever."
5,Visit Sting in excellent form,"I bought this album before I was ever a big Sting fan - as a matter of fact I think I got it as one of those 10 CD's for a penny deals, when I didn't see anything else on the list I could stomach. The hunch has proved to be most excellent. Every song has it's own grove, all of which are upbeat in nature. The stories are great, and I find meaning (at least marginally) in every tune. I find myself revisiting this CD often now in the wake of ""Brand New Day"" - if you're a new Sting listener and looking for more based on that tune, this is a good place to start."
5,Very good cd.,"I listened to this Cd on the way in to work this morning, and I must tell you it is a great CD. Full of Jazz and rockish jazz... my favorite story teller song is SOMETHING THE BOY SAID.... very good story and full of anticipation. If you like sting, u will like this, perhaps a lot."
4,Versatile massager,The massager was invigorating. The package says not to use it for longer than 5 minutes and for good reason. If the massager is not in the right place on your head it can start to hurt. I wish the spokes were softer or more flexible. The circumfrence was to big for my head. The reason I said it was versatile is because you can use the top part as a massage on other sore areas of your body.
3,I prefer the non-motorized units,"Nothing wrong with it, I just like the subtlety of the non-motorized ones. Product was as described and worked as described."
5,Sanctified Blues,"This is a blues album of the most rare kind. Danny gives artistic rhythm and feeling to his struggles of faith, the good times and the bad, and imbues some old experiences from his life with godly wisdom. There are no pyrotechnics here, just skillful licks and a mellifluous voice that can melt a hardened heart or drip honey into bitter waters. Songs like ""Overnight Thing"" encourage us when we begin to feel hopeless about our spiritual development. ""Ready"", like ""Time to Change,"" provides an upbeat harmonica encouraging us to get ready for the return of Christ, get our act together, or just to redeem the time. ""Turn You Around"" will make you want to dance in the love of God while others like ""You Gave Me Your Love"" and ""Covered in Blue"" are blues inflected meditations on the love of God and sometimes the feeling that He has left us. There is a little treasure of God's revelation to be found in each one of these moving songs. Buy and enjoy. Danny's has an God-given gift."
5,A reminder of what matters.,"I spent about two years being fairly constantly obsessed with achieving ""success."" When I was a awake, I was trying to find inventive ways to market myself. When I went to bed, I had difficulty sleeping either because I was anxious, or because I was running over and over ideas.Mostly, I was anxious. ""What if I'm not as successful as I want to be?"" ""What if I never [do x] again? What if I 'fail'?""Reading the Wisdom Keepers was indescribably calming, because it put life, spirituality, love, and our purpose on earth into such great perspective that my ambitions were put in their proper place. I felt more at peace with myself, with humanity, and with the time we have here. At the same time, I felt sad for how prone we are to prioritize the things that don't necessarily matter in the end, and how readily we'll destroy in the interest of having more, more, more, more..."
5,Reminding us of what is of real importance.,"There is an importance in the simplicity of things that are real and natural that is expressed eloquently by the people in this book. We need to be reminded, at times of the fact that most of the material things we have, we do not need. People can still live in harmony with the natural world, be very content with their lives. Most people think human beings are material beings with a spiritual side. The Wisdomkeepers live knowing that human beings are spiritual beings with a material side."
5,entrancing,"really intriguing story and tales isn't requiring twenty more words is foolish it's a quick review not a critique, really?"
2,Very Small!!!,"This item is ok but it's very small. Not everything like, the head phones & the charger don't fit in the bag. The car adapter does fit but you have to cram it in there & it makes it awkward & bulky. The bag is not as large as they say. It's ok for the dvd player but everything else... no way. If I could return it I would. There is no way to attach it to the back seat to watch a movie, you have to keep it on your lap at all times which make it a problem if more than one person is going to watch a movie. I think it's a very bad design."
3,Average at best,"I thought the way the story is told, i.e. after the fact, was quite interesting. However, the last part of the story dragged. I think it was a bad idea to lead with the climax of the Indian Wars, the Battle of the Little Bighorn...there isn't anything that comes after that measures up in excitement and interest.The Romance between the main character and Melisande is ridiculously unrealistic. The dialogue between she and Brules was terrible, and her dialogue style was...very whiny."
3,NOT WORTH THE HASSLE,"Box delivered in good condition but when I opened it up table had huge crack in it. It works ok just have to be careful when moving it. It wasn't worth the inconvience of having to package it back up, If I were to do it all over again I would NOT BUY ON LINE!!!"
5,Beutiful and unique watch peice,This watch is one that coordinates well with teals and tourquioses. It's electronically interchangable face makes for an interesting piece.
1,Piece of JUNK,"I am sad to say that this is the first review I have written on Amazon. But I was so disappointed in the performance of this porduct I just had to express myself. Even though this porduct was free, I expect it to ""work"". I hooked it up to my S-video port on my TV, turned on the device with a 512MB card containing ~20 3.2 megapixel photos. I was able to view the first 3, then it locked up. I tried several other times with other cards, photos, etc...all with the same results. Luckily my Canon camera came with a video out to display on the TV and I don't have to deal with this piece of JUNK. I give it one star because the batteries for the remote worked."
1,Does not work with my Kodak camera,"Frustrating. It always gives me a message saying ""Card error"" when I insert my SanDisk CF card from my Kodak DC240 digital camera. I can view the pictures in the camera but the DPV does not work. The sandisk website FAQ is also not very helpful."
3,Petaybee,Being an Anne McCaffrey fan I was expecting more. It was quite readable but it doesn't come up to most of her other books - even the romantic ones.
3,A decent read.,"Having re-read the three previous books just before purchasing Changelings, I expected more of a indepth story line. What I got is a very good time waster but not a book to read over and over again. Overall? not there best book but still a good book all the same."
3,The PTB Find Another Trip Slow,"The kids are fun and the situation interested, but expected and way too predictable. Unless you are reall into the talking planet bit, skip it until you see it on the library shelf."
3,Disappointing...,"I had high hopes for this novel, but am I ever glad I picked it up at the library instead of spending money on it! The idea was good, but the execution was just blah. Not exciting, not horrible, just rather lukewarm the entire way through. Characters behaved in a formulaic manner, sometimes doing things out of character in order to push the plot along. (Ex: Who sends their kids away for their safety but forgets to alert those protecting them of WHO they are protecting them FROM???) Just a lot of little things that add up to a less-than-stellar book."
1,Annoying,"I have a Sony computer, and was excited when I found this product. One of the biggest problems I have is whenever I record a show, I have to either watch it on the computer or burn onto a DVD to watch on a regular TV. It's a hassle. I didn't want even more wires running across the floor, so I was thrilled to learn this reciever would work wirelessly. Unfortunately that didn't happen. It's wireless ability simply did not exist, nor did the costumer support at Sony. It work fine when it was wired with real cable (not wirelessly). Needless to say, I've since returned the product for a full refund."
2,un-involving story,"I read this based on so many glowing reviews. Although I liked some of Wintons wording, the story as a whole falls rather short. I never really fell in love with any of the characters. The plot takes turns that arent that interesting, and the extensive metaphors seemed either obvious or so far removed that one would never tie them all together. Slow read, so so character development, jumpy plot, but interesting wording by Winton made this readable but not one I would recommend."
5,St. Michael's on a Cloud,"Merryn Anstee and Scott Crozier's 2004 production of 'Cloudstreet' is being presented by the acclaimed St. Michael's Grammar School (St. Kilda, Melbourne, Australia) as part of their 2004 Senior Drama Festival. The school, whose alumnus contributes to many facets of Australia's theatre industry, will present six performances at The Studio on campus, opening 23 July 2004. Merryn Anstee is hailed as one of Australia's finest drama teachers and foremost theatre directors. St. Michael's is noted as Australia's most prestigious academic and dramatic arts training institutions.The school has had recent successful seasons of Peter Shaffer's 'Amadeus', Stephen Sondheim's 'Sweeney Todd', Carol Churchill's 'Top Girls' and Shakespeare's 'King Lear'. Season sold out."
2,Toner too expensive,"In interests of full disclosure, I chose not to buy this printer due to toner costs. Just check those costs before you buy. A 3000 page toner costs $79, versus $54 for the toner of an equivalent Brother (say the HL1440 which I have owned) or $70 for a 6000 page Brother toner. I think Samsung is known to do this ""make the profit in the refills"" for this printer."
5,"Enter this book,&you'll relive a late-18th century France!","Wonderful!I've never read a history (fiction) book as mesmerizing as this! MRS.Gulland recounts the events so wonderfully and the speeches so livably that as though I'm living in the-18th century France with Josephine. Well, I prefer to call this book a 'struggle for living' book rather than a romantic book, it's better to be called a biography than a novel. It's so fantastic for all ages, including an-11-year old girl like me. LISEZ CE LIVRE, ET VOUS SEREZ UNE FOLLE APRES!"
5,Fantastic historical fiction!,"As a fan of historical fiction, I found this book extremely absorbing. It is written in very readable prose, the French in it is always correct, and the story a captivating one, sometimes it's hard to believe that the protagonist actually existed! Josephine is portrayed as a real woman who endures hardship and still manages to hold on to compassion and love for others less fortunate than herself, she is a woman whose influence is powerful, a ""modern"" woman to be admired today. I highly recommend this novel, especially for book clubs, and look forward to reading the sequel. This one is hard to put down!"
5,Totally addictive,"This first book in Sandra Gulland's trilogy about the life and times of Josephine and Napoleon is wonderful, the second in the series is better, and the third will not let you sleep till you're done with it! There is a cautionary note at the end of the last book that warns that this subject is addictive. The warning came too late for me! The most incredibly wonderful historical writing since Michael Grant's Cleopatra."
5,"Wonderful Read, Great Historical Reference","This was a wonderful book, filled with fabulous tidbits of French life. An example would be-did you know that women used mouse fur to enhance their eyebrows? This is a wonderfully researched book. Besides being great to read it would make a wonderful reference book for someone writing a report, or learning about the French Revolution. The author gives you a true insight into who, what, when, where and why. While this is about a woman, this book would also be a great read for a man with its' explanation of the war and jails of the period. The entire book is footnoted. I've never read a more insightful book about any of the Bonapartes."
3,Interesting but lacking depth,"This did not live up to the hype for me. The subject matter was interesting since I knew nothing about Josephine and little of the French Revolution from my long-ago history classes, but found that the diary format leads to a fairly superficial telling of the story. Without a different narrator, one does not get the depth and nuance of the characters. Except for Josephine herself, the rest of the characters are fairly thinly drawn. Several friends raved about this, so it just didn't live up to the hype."
1,Disappointment,"This book is tedious. The Artist's Way is a great book, but this one suffers from too much information, a lot of self-absorption and ego, and too little self-reflection or understanding. She is probably too famous and too beloved by others to be able to think clearly about herself or her situation. The story presented here is at times truly bizarre, though often boring. While it had some interesting thoughts and life lessons about sobriety, mostly what I will remember from the book is that it is a story of someone who is never happy where she is living and keeps ""taking a geographic"" as they call it. The world seems to disappoint her."
1,Waste of money,"Very disappointed with this book. I have been facilitating African drumming and singing groups for over ten years and really thought that this book would give me a lot of new material to work with. Kept it for a couple of years in my attic as I was reluctant to throw it away after paying so much money, but finally decided to throw it away in the recycling bin."
5,ZZ Top's Illegitimate Sons,"For a long time I've been going back and listening to ZZ Top's first few albums, wishing that the Little Band From Texas would record some new stuff of the same calibre as Waiting For The Bus or I'm Bad, I'm Nationwide.Thanks to TailDragger, we needn't wait any longer. With Skeptictank, these guys have distilled the essence of what made those early CDs great, cooked it into a spicy blend, and marinated themselves in it.This 3-piece band (with occasional added keyboards) flat out smokes. They lay out a generous portion of southern-style, blues drenched boogie, with a healthy sense of humor. The guitar work is top-shelf, the rhythm section is tight as a mouse's ear.I kept this CD in my player for weeks and still keep it close by for sudden monkey attacks.If you don't like this CD, check your pulse.Good Stuff!!!"
2,Carole Lombard,"This book read as if the author just accumulated facts from other writers and listed them in a sterile ""here are the facts and only the facts"" type of way. Not fun. Not very interesting. Very little insight into Carole Lombard.Really a disappointment."
2,Didn't last long,"Bought this to make some small cuts in the porcelain tile I'm putting in.Probably made a total of 8' in cuts and all the cutting diamonds are gone, the old worn out one made more cuts than this one.Used it with a cordless Makita that has a water supply to keep the blade wet.I'm trying to find something better now, may have to find another saw."
5,Weekends with the numbers,"I just want to add, Jays analysis of the ISOMORPHISMS process with induction to the lower frontal reverse cyclops is right on. My boyfriend Richard and I both read it even twice during our vacation in Key West. The rest of the night we just could't stop talking about Jay's work.Fantastic Jay, keep it up...with love, simply Patrick"
1,IT,"when we call Intel to obtain RMA, they said that's not retail version, we need vendor to replace or return."
5,Excellent!,The tips of the teeth are rounded and very gentle; my cat enjoys being combed with it. I was a shocked by the sheer number of fleas this comb extricated from my (seemingly healthy) cat!
3,Not as Good,"While I loved ""All That and a Bag of Chips,"" I found the sequel doesn't compare. It was too unrealistic. But it was nice to catch up with the characters and see where they are in their lives and careers. While not as good as her first, it is still worth reading. Looking forward to ""What Goes Around Comes Around."""
2,Dissapointed,"When I purchase an item i like to see non biased individual comments about that specific item on forums like this. I usually skim the high rated ones and carefully examine the low ratings people offer to see what problems have been experienced. I did that with the samsund ml-1710 and after close examination I bought one. I was happy at first, but within the first 400 pages of text documents I am now one of the dissatisfied consumers of this item. It prints very softly and disabling the economy feature is futile. I might invest on a toner cartidge eventually to see if it fixes the problem, but till then i will rely on an inkjet."
2,Get youself a dot-matrix first; the print quality is similar,I hasten to say that I did not buy this printer. My fiancee brought it home to use for printing wedding invitations and working from home. This printer has extremely poor resolution. I have been spoiled on office Hewlett-Packard lasers since college and the Samsung reminds of the dot matrix printer I used to use when I was 10 years old. I print out small font (around 4.5) labels for museum-quality insect specimens and this printer is completely worthless in that regard. Parts of letters and entire forms of punctuation disappear at this size.This printer is the kind of printer that preys on people who don't know what they are shopping for. Don't be fooled by the price (which is indeed low for a laser printer). You'd be better off playing the price for this printer on a single number in Las Vegas. At least then you'd have a small chance of getting some value out of your investment.Summary: very poor printer with a low price.
5,ML-1710 Samsung Laser Printer,"I bought this printer after spending too much money on ink jet cartridges . This printer was very easy to set up. I hooked up the power cable along with the USB 2.0 Device Cable, turned on the printer and put the disk that comes with the printer in the computer. I didn't even have to open a manual. I started printing immediately with no problems. Printing is good quality also. Printer isn't loud, it's rather quiet.I looked at the Brother's and HP's printers and found that this one was the one to buy. With the rebate you can't go wrong. This will pay for itself in just a few months time. I'm very happy with this printer!!!"
3,"Cheap printer, easy to use","Pros:set-up is very easy, prints fairly fastCons:toners cost you extra $70, you will be surprised with lousy printing sounds.Overall, it's not that bad, but not the best one at the same time."
1,Don't Rely on Starter Toner Cartridge,The starter cartridge that ships with the printer has a short duty cycle. A standard toner cartridge or two is recommended to have on after the first 2 to 6 months of use.
1,not worth the paper it was printed on,"There is no way this book could be considered reiki. please read the review from tennessee, that person expressed my sentiments exactly, no one who practices reiki would do any of the things or practices that this so called manual describes. for your own good stay away from this one."
1,Makita Blade,Terrible blade. Lasted about 15 cuts on 2 inch wall tile before teeth started to break off. Way to expensive for that.
4,"Bag keeps getting smaller, price stays the same","My cat has been eating this for years, and it seems that the bag keeps getting smaller and the price (for a while) kept going up! My cat has very sensitive stomach - so this does the trick. I just hoped it contained more meat verses fillers!"
3,A good place to begin,"I would suggest that this book might be a good place for anyone in management to begin if he or she senses that there is some undercurrents in the work pool. It is readable and seems to understand how the employee under a supervisor feels. If your employee reads it, you should know of the strategies suggested for dealing with the boss (you). It was helpful. It is a quick read."
5,A very good guide book for opthalmic surgeons...,"Due to relatively fragile structure of the eye, opthalmic surgery requires special skills and more practical background, long practical preparation time for a surgeon to get ready. A very good book which transfers the practical experiences of opthalmic surgeons would minimize this time. The book fills a hole in the area in this sense. It has been very beneficial for the surgeries that I have completed."
2,Not an accurate assessment,"I gave this video as a gift to a person that was in the Battle of the Bulge and he said it was not good. It was told more from the English perspective than the American perspective which didn't sit well since the English lost 200 soldiers and the Americans lost 18,000 in this battle. The audio was not good either. Only mentions Patton's army once."
1,"STINK, STANK, STUNK!!!","Compiling two specials made for TNT, and Chuck Jones' 1941 ""Horton Hatches The Egg"" (From his early Disney-like peroid) to boot, it's nothing more than a thrownaway! Get the DVD of ""How The Grinch Stole Christmas"" and ""Horton Hears A Who"" instead!"
3,Cheap purchase,"I bought two of these after a recommendation from a friend. It works pretty well, but I've noticed that they don't hold air all to well. I checked for leaks and couldn't find any. It just seems like the tube itself never fills all the way up. I have to pump my tires up every 4 weeks or so. But no huge leaks. *knock on wood* It is good to mention, that the price is pretty good. My nearest Target had simple tubes for about the price of these. So if it prevents any leaks, it will be worth it."
1,Slime tube Sucks,"This tube was the one of the cheapest mistakes that I've made. It lasted one week. Then popped. Seating this tube is tricky also, due to it's 1.75-2.25 size range. Save yourself time and trouble. Do not buy this tube. Get a tube that is exactly the right size for your application. Skip the Slime B.S. And do not, Whatever you do, Do not purchase from Grady's Online hardware. I had to wait 14 days for it after purchasing."
3,Easy installation - marginal quality,"The installation is easy enough as long as you follow the directions and are careful with the adhesive strips. The quality is a little on the low side, with the light fixtures and optional frosted shades (purchased separately) all being constructed out of fairly light plastic. The lamp assemblies feel fragile and the flexible necks don't seem to stay in place too well, so be careful when making adjustments. The dimmer switch is adequate, but larger than it needs to be and also feels cheap.It works as described, but if I had it to do over again, I probably would spend a few more dollars and find something of higher quality."
5,Another good book by Balkowski!,"This is my fifth Balkowski book, the others on the 29th division and well worth reading about this battle tested Infantry Division. His book on Utah Beach is just as good; he covers the Airborne as well as the amphibious landings, and has many eyewitness account of the action on D-Day plus and pre. Well worth having in your library of ""D-Day"" selections.Bruce"
4,Utah Beach,"Wonderfully detailed but flowed beautifully. As questions began to pop into my brain as I read, I learned that all I needed was a little patience as they would be quickly answered."
1,Defective Scooter - Lousy Customer Service - No Resolution,"I bought this scooter for my daughter for Xmas. I tried to put it together a few days before, but the front forks were twisted and bent. Called Customer Service and they assured me a new part would arrive before Xmas. Xmas came and went. Called one week after the first call and was told they couldn't have shipped a part because the parts dept. was closed for inventory. The part would be shipped that day three day shipping. One week later - no part. Called again and was told the part is on backorder. No due date and they would not replace the scooter - only the part. I was told Manager of Customer Service was too busy to speak with me. Filing a complaint with the State of California - Dept. of Customer Protection. Have no idea if the scooter is fun or not - it's still in the box. Save your money and buy a better product - don't by from Currie Technologies."
2,Questionable,"Two stars for a fun, but most likely, fictional read. It's entertaining but appears not to be much more than that. This woman seems to give herself a great deal of credit for things she cannot convincingly substantiate. Think Forrest Gump--she is in all the right places at the right times yet hides behind an anonymous facade so that she does not have to answer the hard questions. After reading her book, I caught her on FOX news a couple of times. She seemed to have a difficult time keeping her stories straight.It sounds like she has a beef with the government by portraying them as inept and childlike. While there may or may not be truth to her allegations, it sounds more like she has a chip on her shoulder, perhaps they never took her as seriously as she takes herself. The reader gets the feeling they are being taken for a ride on an ego that is a bit out of control."
5,Go to SITE her research companys inernet site,"Go to her reasearch companys site,and maybe even put it on as your home page.It is www.siteinstitute.orgThe ""site"" is incredable, just like the book,but it has the latest breaking news."
4,Wonderful series of British naval life.,Alexander Kent takes the reader back to the later part of the 18th century and accurately portrays life in the Britsh Royal Navy. His series follows the life of Richard Bolitho from joining the navy as a midshipman through the ranks to Admiral. The mix of fictional events and characters along with historicly accurate events makes this a must read for fans and students of this era.
2,PSP Grip Dock: Bad Choice!,"I purchased this item because I play a lot of PSP games and my hands and wrists hurts for a long period of time playing. The grip itself helps prevent and keeps the pain I'm having playing PSP.The unit itself is BAD. Cooling fan is noisy and the speaker are distorted(meaning sound quality is very poor). Also, the most heviest grip of all."
4,Excellent camera once you get the right settings,"Easy to use, good pix. But some of the settings were a problem: using autofocus makes this camera very very slow. Manual focus works fine except for stuff closer than one meter, so I set it permanently on MF. Now it's fast.Tons of features, most of which I won't ever use. (The 3-D photo thing is a weird gimmick...) But there are plenty of things to like, such as the color filters and the (rather crude) in-camera image cropping.Overall, very pleased."
1,Worst 4MP digicam ever!!!,This camera may have 4 MP resolution but it has low definition and is one of the noisiest cameras I have ever seen. My old 2MP coolpix 950 looks much better. Exchanged it for the 3.2MP Canon Powershot A70 today.Cool looks can be misleading...
5,Good form factor and picture quality,"The Optio takes true 4MP pictures, which are good for enlarged prints. The image quality is good, with decent colors and slightly soft edges. (I personally don't like sharp edges anyway.) The form factor makes it easy to hold, and the 3X optical zoom is fast and accurate. You can use either the LCD viewfinder or the optical viewfinder, the latter saving you considerable battery life. A solid product that I think you'll like. Do look around for the best price."
2,"Educational, but not fun","This game has lots of facts and could help you learn more about the world. If you are looking for an educational experience, I think it could be great for a classroom setting in elementary school. The downside to the game is that it is not that fun for adults. Game play is slow and then the game can be over before it starts if someone recognizes a picture. if you are an elementary of middle school teacher I recommend this game, if you are looking for a fun family game, I don't think this is it."
3,"Nice amp, doesn't like active pickups","Nice features. This amp doesn't like active basses with ""hot"" pickups. There is an active switch but it cuts too much of the signal when activated. There was noticeable distortion through the speakers. When I was using my passive bass I blew a power capacitor but it was fixed for free. I bought this amp when it first came out I am sure GK addressed this issue. There is an XLR output for a PA system that sounded great in live situations. But when I was in a recording session the XLR output was useless. The engineer said there too much noise coming from the jack."
5,No Frills Workhorse,"The GK800RB has been my main gig amp for the last 10 years or so. I stack it on top of two Fender Sidekick horn loaded cabs each containing a JBL E140 15 inch speaker. I briefly tried the bi-amp feature but found it unnecessary to obtain the bass punch I need, so I just use the two low end speaker outputs. The amp has seen me through indoor gigs, outdoor gigs, low volume venues and ear beaters. It has never failed to live up to its reputation as a workaholic. I pretty much set it and forget it, going into it with a Fender Jazz Bass and dialing my tone in at the bass. It has never quit even though it has been subjected to some pretty rough treatment. I lost a knob off it when the equipment trailer suffered a mishap and after that put it into a simple Home Depot hinged metal case for protection during transportation. No flashing lights or built in effects, but it gets the job done. Every time."
2,Beware: it sheds,"I bought the runner and have had it for a week. I am keeping the rug because it is different and I have it in a small hallway between all the bedrooms and it is cozy on our feet. I have sheddings from this rug all over the house,though, and the rug is not nearly as full as the picture. It is fluffy like a sheepdogs fur but bare. You have to shake it to fluff it up. It's like a big furry blanket."
1,Very weak Magnet,Took a lot of time making a bracelet and ut it on and it fell off after a few movements I have used magnetic bead clasps before and the magnet was strong and the bracelet was safe. I guess you get what you pay for.
5,Fast and Nite,I like the service and confidence that Amazon can offer to their customers.The watch and more stuff i bought in amazon are always good purchasesThere is no doubt that buying in Amazon is the easest and best way to buy online
5,"Wow---here's a refreshing, quality movie!","""King of the Ants"" is a throw-back to the days when movies were well-written, well-acted and thoroughly enjoyable to watch. The story of a conflict between a father and his son is timeless. Tedd Taskey's screenplay is gutsy and believable, and reveals him to be a most talented writer. His acting---and the rest of the cast's----is outstanding as well. I'm looking forward to his next movie!"
1,Horrible!,I am a college student and a long-time fan of science fiction. Time Enough For Love was my first foray into Heinlein and it might be my last. This was one of the worst books I've ever read! A meandering piece of garbage! I would give it negative stars if I could. The incest really bothered me in this novel because I thought of Lazarus Long as a pervented grandfather type. The novel has some tender moments but it did not justify my time. If your looking for a novel about immortals/longevity I would suggest Zelazny's Lord of Light. Now Im hestitant to read any more of Heinlein's works - this one was so excreable.
1,Self-serving drivel,"After a friend of mine went on about how great a writer Heinlein is, I tried out this book. What utter drivel! I actually read through the whole thing hoping that eventually there would be some point to it - I shouldn't have bothered - there isn't! It puts me off reading anything else by him."
1,"Great Book, Poor Editing","A wonderful book by a great author. The editor for the kindle version, if there even was one, is obviously a middle school dropout or dead. There are tons of spelling mistakes and incorrect formatting issues. It seems impossible that somebody read the conversion before posting this for sale. I am beginning to think that publishers are so lazy and greedy that they don't even bother to proofread kindle versions of books. For shame. Otherwise a great read."
2,cerebral,"Never one to dislike a Heinlein story- but this one brings me as close as I ever have. Not that the writing isn't brilliant Heinlein, but if you're looking for an action story where things happen and characters face alot of interesting and heart-stopping adventures- this ain't it. Its really about the disjointed and romantice remincences of Lazarus Long, a very old man who's tired. There are aot of great quotes in the book and every third page, you'll read a great line and think ""I have GOT to write that down!"". But the story drags out. A loooong way out. And to me, it became more of a chore to read and finish just because its Heinlein, not because its a great book."
1,"Do not waste your time reading this book, you'll regret it.","This is simply the worst book I ever read. In fact, I didn't even bother to finish it. I grew tired of waiting for an interesting plot to develop and threw the book into the trash after 250 pages.The other negative reviews nicely sum up why this book is so bad. To me, reading this book is as painful as listening to a bad stand-up comic for 4,000 years."
3,ehh,"I can't call this a great book at all - it does capture, pretty well, the variety of life that a man 2000 yrs old must have had and it raises interesting social questions (AI, suicide, homosexuality, prostitution, incest) in typical Heinlein fashion - as part of an ongoing book.But the society of the future is not clear and compelling - the characters are not particularly different from each other - the issues are not particularly explored. There are elements of Heinlein's genius here, but it is fading."
4,Great compilation by a truly awesome Christian band,"The only flaws in it was that none of the tracks were made earlier than 1994 except for ""No Second Chances"", made in 1991, and that was a mediocre remix. I also think they should've put ""In The Kingdom"" on there, as it puts me near tears every time I hear it...Anyway, on to the CD in question. Other than those two flaws, I'm speechless. It's very wonderfully arranged. I could listen to it over and over again and still love it. The best tracks on this CD are ""Collide"", ""Faraway Places"", and ""Full Crucifixion"". I can only make one more comment about it: if you love great rock music, get your hands on this CD one way or another...you will not regret it!"
3,It's an OK cd.,"I got this cd cause of the songs it contained. When I received it , it wasn't all that. But I still recommended if you like all your favorite songs in 1 cd. She's the best in whatever she does."
5,Introduce Creationism to the little ones!,I love this simple book that explains so clearly to the littlest kids WHY Creationism makes GOOD SENSE and is GOOD SCIENCE.
4,Feminin,"The material is soft and unlike anything I have worn before. The top is very feminin and the colur is a nice ivory. It is not an hold-in top, - but it covers stomack area nicely and will be great under light blouses and tops."
2,Taking pictures of kids?,We purchased this camera and had to return it because the shutter delay is excruciating. I filled an entire memory card with pictures of my boys and didn't get one good shot. In some frames there was no subject because my toddler was 6 feet away before the shutter finally clicked (3 to 4 seconds after the hitting the button). The LED screen on the back was also faulty giving a red cast to the scene at hand - not like my previous Olympus digital.I can't recommend another model as we are still looking for that perfect choice.
4,Seems bright enough when in my hand,Great shipping and nice that it's ready to go right out of the package. When I'm holding it and look right into the light it seems painfully bright yet that effect maybe directional. When it's on the bike and I walk behind the bike to eval the light it is less impressive. Overall it's a good value and I have no regrets but I will continue to use the reflective vest in addition to the lights.
2,Effective but fails in snow/rain,"The features are great - internal reflector, two low power LEDs and one 'high' power LED which does a good job for the batteries used. The lighting modes are also welcome and battery lifetime seems good (several months with perhaps 1 hour use per week day).The bad: Well, it's not properly sealed. Snow can creep into the base and short out the connections where the 'button' switch is. The light will then fail until opened up and dried out. It's embarrasing riding along and suddenly realizing the rear light has failed - fortunately I had a cheap backup which is less effective BUT waterproof.I have two of these (one for each bike) and they both display this problem. I haven't tried them in the rain yet but would not be surprised if this also causes issues."
5,Super Light,"I bought this for my brother who is an avid cyclist. (He frequently rides 100+ miles at a time)He did the research and asked specifically for this bike light, and was very pleased to receive it."
5,Great Bike Light,I use these on both my commuter bikes. The big lense flashes intensly and lasts for a long time(40 hours +) on the rechargeables(AAA)I use. Easy to install and remove.
3,Not strong enough a light,"I love the flash pattern of this light, however it's not bright enough for me to use as a primary taillight in the daytime in urban traffic. I use it as a secondary light along with my primary, which seems to work well. I am not a fan of the on/off ""hidden button"" because it takes some significant pressure for your fingers (especially through thick winter gloves) to press this ""button"" and at the same time sometimes when the bike runs into bumps it jolts this light into another mode or off. Great use for night time riding though as a primary light. I think in the future I would upgrade to a Dinotte 400L or the DesignShine taillight which is twice is bright as the Dinotte."
5,"planet bike ""super flash"" led rear blinker","This product is by far the best rear, red light led blinker, that I could find. I use it during the day to increase my visibility. I commute approx 5 miles to work year round (my return home is in the dark) . Blinker has performed beautifully even in 10 degree F conditions. Excellent product. It is well worth the price!"
4,Bike reat light,"It is a very bright rear light, super flash is excellent looks like a police strobe or a airplane lights, the only downside is that there is no reflector on the light so you would need to keep original seat post red reflector that came with your bike just in case. Another thing I'd like to mention that the bracket is a little flimsy. the light can fall from the bracket easily and could be lost. So far it didnt fall but I suggest to keep an eye on it. You will not be able to see the red light it produces when you ride the bike. First time when I went for a ride with this light I thought it was turned off or fell although it was on and was producing a very bright light."
5,"nice bright light, flashes, way cool","the kid loves this light, likes all the modes, has a lot of fun with itA good buy, makes the bike safe at night."
5,All you need,"Very, very bright. Anything stronger is overkill. In fact, it might already be overkill if you ride with others (it can be frustrating to ride behind someone with it). For a commuter, it's a godsend. Absolutely no way anyone will miss you. Bright enough for day use, too. Seeing as how a cheaper option would not save you much more (this is already very inexpensive), I would not recommend spending less for a cheaper light. Spend the few extra bucks - it's more than worth the difference."
1,No subtitles,Can't find out how to play the DVD with the subtitles if it does have subtitles they seem to be hidden.
5,A great memory of the best college football player of all time!!,"I just finished reading all of the reviews of this DVD and let me tell you that this is a great DVD for the average fan. I have no idea what to tell you if you're here looking for a great ""digital transfer"" or what not. All that I know, is that this was possibly the greatest National Championship of all-time featuring the arguably best college football player of all time in Vince Young.The DVD features the entire game with the original game commentary but minus all the commercials. As I said, I don't really care about the quality of the video. It is good enough to watch and enjoy the game, jus as if you were watching it on TV. I can't say much more than that about the quality; however, it brings back so many memories about that great game, that great team, and of course Vince Young himself! You need to make this DVD a part of your collection if you are a true Longhorn fan!"
3,Game only,I was hoping for DVD to include game highlights and commentary. All it incliuded was the game and the game only.
4,USB 2.0 for Readybosst,"I bought this USB stick (along with a PCI card to support USB 2.0) entirely for ReadyBoost in Vista. My Dell 8200 was only running on 1Gb of RAM and RIMM memory is cost prohibitive to increase so it would appear that ReadyBoost was the answer. For that purpose, this USB stick fit well and has performed nicely in increasing load times for well used apps (Outlook 2007 takes about 4 seconds from clicking on the icon to being completely up and running)."
5,RV Essential,"I have one of these mounted on my 5th wheel travel trailer. It works so well that when I purchased a stick house, I decided to mount one in the closet next to my satellite receiver. I will mount my wireless cellular broadband router in the entertainment center and connect a data cable to the Dishnet satellite receiver. The Dishnet receiver can connect to Dishnet via phone line or data (RJ45) connection. This will allow me to continue to be cellular only in my new home."
4,Rare Find,"After remembering how much fun I had playing the Playstation version years ago, and hearing some of the music recently, I was dying to play it again. I'm glad I could find it here and now I'll always be able to play it."
3,OK,"The clippers do what they are supposed to do. They are not the highest quality but for the price, it is to be expected. If you just take a little care when you use them and file the edges, you will be fine."
4,Great clippers for the price,These clippers aren't the best out there but they are inexpensive and do the job very well.
2,It could've been me but my dogs and I are not a fan,"Bought this a while back for my mastiff. A few clips in and he was visibly unhappy about me clipping his nails. This was after reading instructions, watching online videos, and having my vet show me how to use them. I thought it was me because when the vet clips him, my dog is OK. Then we got a second dog, a puppy. When she was a small puppy, I was using a small scissor type nail clipper. She did well with those. She didn't mind me cutting her nails at all. When she got big enough, I went to use this clipper and it was a whole different story. After two cuts, she went running. It got to the point that if I grabbed them, she would run to her crate. It was inexplicable that a pup I groomed to be OK with nail clipping all of a sudden reacted so poorly. She also was fine when a groomer used a guillotine clipper on her. All I can come up with is there's something wrong with these clippers. The assembly seems loose but it gets no tighter."
3,"Interesting, but not quite there.",If I have anything really good to say about Fire & Ice-Dragon Chronicles it's that the dragons were very imaginative and break out of the typical dinosaur with wings style many use as the basis for a dragon. They are more like reptilian/elemental manta rays flying through the air. For the most part the action and story focuses on the people and the kingdoms affected by the first dragon and much of THAT part of the story is fairly stereotypical (though there were a few good twists).
5,Degrassi The Next Generation- Season 4,It came in the mail very quickly and was an easy dealer to work with! I would definitely buy from them again
5,A copy should be in every school and public library,"I can't say much more than the previous reviewers, except that I whole heartedly agree with them. This is such an excellent book, that everyone can learn something from. I am a wildlife rehabilitator, and I would personally like to thank Shannon Jacobs for writing such an informative and thorough book on the purpose and process of wildlife rehabilitation."
2,Unhappy,"I found the Cajun sniper uninspiring unless you live in the far south and know there lingo it is hard to understand.It reads like a low rate movie,and that is what I would rate it as."
1,Save your cash,"From all the hype I had heard about this book I thought it would be G2G. Yes there was action but very little detail. Took too long to get to the point.Regret buying it. On the other hand ... the other book I bought at the same time (also paperback & MUCH lower in cost) was well worth the read. For action & attention to detail read ""The Devil's Finger""."
3,It's got space for everything you would ever want to record and more,"I got this and one other baby journal before my daughter was born. This one was more ""complete"" but pretty plainly decorated, so I ended up giving it away to someone I knew was having a boy and kept the other one. It's a better size for fitting all the little memorabilia you get from the hospital, etc. but just not very exciting or cute in its own right."
5,Poldark Lover,"This was one of the most popular series on Masterpiece Theatre. Why Why is the studio not bringing this out on DVD. The videos are available, but are very expensive. The first Masterpiece series, The First Churchills is out on DVD and I love that one, why not this one. Please everybody type in your information to Amazon to be contacted when the DVD's are out. Amazon states this is a vote for the product. We can let the studio know we Want ALL OF BOTH Poldark series out on DVD ASAP."
1,Really not very good at all,"The information about the Everglades is nice, but the book had absolutely no character development. None of the characters ever changed. I feel bad that my library has multiple copies of this book and is still prominently displaying them."
2,Dark and depressing,"I did not enjoy reading this book - I found it to be much darker than expected. I'd read Hoot by Hiassen which I liked quite a bit, but this book, with its excessive and never-ending revenge-scheming really depressed me. OK, playing with your murdurous husband's mind is funny - to a point. After a while, each of the obsessive, shallow, amoral characters became very uninteresting, and I couldn't wait for the book to end."
4,"Light, Fun Summer Read","I am also a first time Hiassen reader and purchased this book based on the New York Times' positive review. While I enjoyed the humor, I wouldn't go so far as deeming it hilarious. I do recommend it as a fun, fluff read. Perfect for summer."
2,Skinny Dip,"The book starts with an interesting topic but gets boring very quickly. Not a real page turner. It's probably more suited to a younger, high school audience."
4,I enjoyed it,"This is the first time that I have read a book by this author. It did get a little goofy and drawn out, but it was very entertaining. I would read another book by this author."
1,Too Smutty and Full of Environmentalism,"I was very disappointed with the filthy language and shallowness of the characters. Also, if I wanted to read about environmental causes, and big bad industry I'd watch/read National Geographic or go on Internet. I read books like this for entertainment - NOT to get indoctrinated about evil mankind and how we're destroying the planet! Oh yeah, releasing snakes into an environment where there's no natural predator is not a good thing...."
1,Written by a man for men,I bought this book because it was best seller. I got to page 85 before I finally had to throw in the towel and give up on it. From a woman's point of view it was crude and it was just filled with man's sexual fantasies. I tried to stay with it for the story line but it just got to be too much. I hate to even donate this to the library. What a waste of paper and money.
4,Skinny Dip Misses Something,"I absolutely LOVE Carl Hiaasen. I have read all his capers through South Florida and beyond from Tourist Season to Skinny Dip. The twists he puts on actual problems occurring in Florida is always entertaining and informative.Maybe I've read one too many of his books, but this one just wasn't as entertaining as many of his others. I missed his trademark creativity in the disposal of the ""bad guys"". Although, I was thoroughly amused by his addition of the governor. Too bad he had such a small part.For someone not familiar with Hiaasen, I would recommend starting at the beginning - Tourist Season - and working their way through all the twists and turns. No one can truly appreciate the ""Captain"" and all his nuances without going back a few books."
5,Loved it!,"This was one of the funniest books I've ever read. I couldn't put it down, yet I hated to finish it. This was the first book I've ever read by Carl Hiaasen, but now I can't wait to check out some of his other books. It will definitely take you away from the real world for a fun adventure."
3,Good read,"This book was good but surely not the best I've read. I think Mr. Hiaasen may be quite a pervert to have written such things in his book and also a little sadistic...hence the character Chaz.I really did enjoy the mystery and there was a good plot but in the end, we were so left hanging!!!What I want to know is...what really did happen to Chaz?? Did the guy kill him or did he send him to police?? What happened to Ricca?? Nothing was mentioned after her in the church. And most of all, what became of Mick & Joey?? Just a couple words to actually end the story would have been nice.Overall, I did enjoy it but it wasn't a favorite"
3,It was alright,"This was one of those books that I picked up for the sole reason that I didn't have anything else to read at the time. It was an interesting read, where the author knew how to write irony well. Though some times it just felt too drawn out for me, and the plot was lost in the humor of the book. This could have been a good thing, but I just didn't feel like it was what I needed."
5,May be his best so far,"So far, this is the novel that blends the humor, the crime fiction and the environmental activism together in the best way he has done in my opinion.What a great book. For us old-timers, it was fun seeing Skink come back (un-named) in a couple chapters.The Everglades have been under seige for DECADES and there are plenty of those in power that just do not care and enough that can vote that don't stay informed enough.More people should write like Hiaasen, but they cannot.More people in his home state should be worried about the fate of their state.I encourage those that have not already to check out his columns in the Miami Herald. They are available online, of course."
4,Skink's Back,"But just for a minute or two.This book was very enjoyable, but maybe a little too straight forward for readers that really enjoy Hiaasen's wilder stories."
4,Wonderfully Enjoyable!,"A great light and quirky read; humorous, well-written and plotted. A good book for a vacation or a rainy day."
2,"Poor story, not very entertaining","I couldn't get all the way through Hiaasen's latest. The characters weren't believable, the plot lame (supposedly dead wife meets lay-about ex-policeman, hatches plot to harass her ""murderer"" husband). I not only didn't laugh at any of it, I didn't crack a smile. I love a good read but this one certainly doesn't deserve the rave reviews. I won't try this author again."
4,A murder mystery that kept me guessing,"From the aptly-chosen title to the final plot revelation, this book is tightly written and an enjoyable read. The identities of the two mystery characters, the one in the prologue and the professor's friend, were hidden until the end. I had to keep reading until I learned the answer. The characters were believable and adequately developed. Editing details are the reason I don't give the book five stars--decisions such as the use of dialogue with ""ta"" instead of ""to"" and military time written as 14:30 instead of 1430. I especially enjoyed the trial scenes."
3,"Good, not Great","I read this book on Kindle mainly because of the price. I have grown to really enjoy Christian fiction mystery/suspense after reading Whitlow. I ended up talking my teenage son into reading this book, as it is somewhat elementary. Not in the subject matter, but in the prose. It was good, but just didn't appeal to my particular interest."
1,two different sized gloves,"I purchased this item for my wife for Christmas. When she opened them, I noticed that she received two different sizes of gloves. The larger glove fit but the other did not. I will be sending this item back. I hope that you will make it right."
1,It went to the landfill,"I read the reviews for this product ,but, since I had been looking for this exact lamp for so long I ignored what I didn't want to see. That was the review telling me that the poles to the lamp did not fit together well and the threads that you screwed together did not mesh the way they should. Which leaves the lamp wobbly and unstable, not to mention crooked. So please believe this, the poles do not fit together well and the lamp DOES wobble and is unsteady, which is the last thing you want for a lamp that is very hot and could become a fire hazard. Please keep looking, there has to be a better product than this out there. Mine is in the landfill."
4,Great Deal for the Price!!!,"This is a great deal for anyone on a limited budget or newly into woodworking. These are not high-end clamps, but they also don't have a high-end price tag. I was skeptical, but upon arrival I was pleasantly surprise at the quality. They seem very functional. I've been told you can't have too many clamps when woodworking."
1,Freddie forever #1 in my heart,"I haven't received it yet. I had to have it shipped to my cousin in Chicago as the seller would not ship to Toronto, ON.I've given the product 1 star across the board not because of the figure but because of the shipping issues."
5,We love 'Pastaciotta',My family loves Pastaciotta's they are sweet Italian cookie pies made with ricotta or custard. This kitchen tool makes them cute & fun. We even made a PBJ with it too!!AND if you have grandchildren it is a wonderful experience to share making anything with this little crimper.I really like it.
1,Impractical,"the dumplings end up to large to use, with very very small amount of filling, i would not recommend this to anyone else"
3,A brilliant view of recent New York history,"I'm from New York and think it's one of the greatest cities in the world.This video is very realistic. I lived in New York while the World Trade Center was being planned and built. This video really captures a lot of the spirit of the times. A lot of people don't realize that the World Trade Center was a near total financial disaster when it opened and was considered by many a giant mistake. New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller saved the day by moving a lot of New York state offices into the complex.Paradoxically, the World Trade Center represented little of the ""free enterprise"" vision that many see as gospel today. It was the creation of a government agency, the Port Authority - not free enterprise.Nevertheless, I think it was a big plus for New York, and it eventually became a financial success."
5,ONE IF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL ENTERTAINERS EVER!,"THE CD IS GREAT.BUT IT LACKS A FEW SONGS WHICH HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN MENTIONED,AND I'M SUPRISED THEY WEREN'T ON THIS COMPILATION...THE WAY OF LOVE, LOVE AND UNDERSTANDING,WHEN YOU SAY LOVE,ALL I EVER NEED IS YOU,WE ALL SLEEP ALONE,BEAT GOES ON...AND MANY OTHERS...THEY ALL CHARTED...OH WELL,ANYWAY,SOON WE WILL GET A BOX SET SOON ALONG WITH ALL THE RARE GEMS THAT WERE NEVER REALEASED LIKE 'LOVE IN IN THE AIR'...AND 'DON'T LEAVE ME THIS WAY'...AND SO MANY OTHERS.......5 STARS INDEED!"
4,Another Greatest Hits????????,"Im giving this hits cd 4 stars only because it has alot of good songs, however how about waiting til she has a couple more dance albums then release one with all the hits from that? This has a lot of songs on it already I have on another hits album minus the believe and living proof cuts. I think even a Cher Remix cd would be better, havent seen one of those. Hopefully in future someone will release one soon."
5,Excellent compilation of her 21 hits!,"This is a very great album! I noticed a lot of record labels that she was on. Seemed like they didn't know how to market or promote those albums during her short stints with them. But her singing stood out on all of them and she kept moving forward in her career in music, TV and movies. I like the earlier hits on here, even though it was 1977 that I first heard her songs. Except for I Got You Babe, some of the '60s songs are those I got to hear for the first time on this collection. But the later decades of the '80s, '90s and recently I recognized, especially If I Could Turn Back Time, Believe, Take Me Home, Song For the Lonely and others. There seems to be an emphasis toward her two most recent albums with the songs, but they were smart to cover every phase of her career. This is a fabulous career retrospective on her music and Cher is a true diva in every sense of the word!!!!!"
4,Looking at all sides of the question,"When will the rapture occur? Personally, I'm hoping that the ""pre-tribulation"" folks are right. But after reading this, I'm not so sure. Regardless of where you stand on the subject, this is a good book to read and think about. Is the author right? I don't know (yet)...but one day we'll all know."
4,medchem book,I think this is a great book. The concepts are easy to understand and the illustrations are helpful. reads like most other chemistry books.
5,Excellent!,The book was brand new just like it said in the description and it was shipped very fast.
3,you get what you paid for,"I like the fabric. I like the fit and size. But, there are some flaws like the frontal etched design is made up of foam (is not detachable therefore could not be washed in a regular washing machine, hand-washed preferably), messy stitching (I have to ""clean"" it up), some stitches shows up ( I have to redo them). Otherwise, I was able to wear it as my Halloween costume with some alterations."
3,A Failed Restraunt,This book is about what happened to a resturant from the concept through opening and the closing of the establishment. If you have never worked in the Food Industry then I would not by this book. If you have been in the food industry you might enjoy the read. I have been in the industry for over 20 years and found the book kind of intresting but nothing outstanding. The other reviews hear just are trashing the book for no reason.
1,A failed attempt of recounting a failed restaurant,"My book club chose this book as this month's selection. There was not a moment that I enjoyed reading the book. The writing style leaves much to be appreciated. You want this restaurant to fail from the first page on -- no one is sympathetic. The best part of this book was getting to the end, when I would no longer have to endure the torture of reading it."
1,"maybe now haters will appreciate ""Darkness Falls""","Hunky guys, pretty women, and even scream queen PJ Soles (who is strictly in here just for her name, because she's useless) can't save this one. Using the same exact legend of that was the basis for Darkness Falls, this film gets worse and worse as it moves along, after a really creepy intro.The acting is terrible, and the bottom line is, the ""spirit"" of tooth fairy goes around killing people using modern day power equipment, like wood chippers and nail guns. There's nothing scary or atmospheric about it. The only thing it has going for it is a couple of good gore scenes.Seriously, if you're going to steal an idea from a movie that was panned by critics and horror fans, seems like it would be a snap to make it tens times better.I'll stick to Darkness Falls and it's creepy atmosphere."
1,Just plain awful.,"I liked this movie better when it was called Darkness Falls! This is the same horror movie you've seen a dozen times already, just substitute whichever backstory you want for the 'bad guy' to get this one. It's so boring and unoriginal, you'll be hard pressed to stay awake during it."
5,Face the Music: simply superb!,"Fantastic musical by the great Irving Berlin. This old show of the thirties is melodious and rich in interesting lyrics. The recording is excellent. If you love the music by Irving Berlin, the purchase of this item is a must."
4,Amarige by Givenchy,"I am very happy with the Eau de Toilette, it was a birthday present from my son. It took longer than usual to get to me. However, I understand it was Christmas period."
1,Be ready to mark fast.,This game would be much better if the numbers were called slower. It's the most rapid calling I have ever seen. It's impossible to keep up. The pens that come with the game dried up after the first game that we played and the marks on the cards didn't come off without water. We ended up returning the game the first day we bought it. We found it's smart just to stick to the old fashion way.
3,somewhat disappointed,When I recieved this product I could not get the batteries to charge. Called uniden and was told the batteries were faulty and to send a copy of sales slip to parts dept. and they would send new batteries. After 4 days and heard nothing went out and bought batteries at radio shack. The phones worked fine.After 10 days called uniden and was transfered to the parts deprt. was told it would be 7 to 10 working days to get the batteries. after 5 days recieved 1 battery not 2. The phones are fine but the experience with uniden was not very good.
3,They Shouldn't Have Abused Pac's Work Like This,"Look, I hate to give a Tupac album anything less than four stars but this album just doesn't deserve more than 3 stars. I do like the record but it is horribly abused. I think Afeni only gave the production job to Eminem because she would have hated to reject him. She can't really enjoy watching him do this. I mean as a rapper Eminem is great, but as a producer LOL!! His making Pac say stuff like ""G Unit"" and ""Hey Em turn that s*** up"" and messing with Tupac's voice which I think is simply unacceptable. They should have hired producers he worked with while he was alive. So like I said I can enjoy this to a degree but am horrified at the abuse of the legends work."
3,Average,I thought that this cd would be better there is a few good songs but nothing that great usually better stuff from 2pac
2,Dre should have produced this ablum!,"This ablum is Bs! Everyone Eminem is cool with is on this ablum. I dont want to listen to another Eminem cd featuring 2Pac, I want a 2pac cd. I am a fan of Eminem and 2pac, but em should have never touched 2pac's music. It is disrespectful for him to even be on the Black cotton track, what the F*** was he thinking.This ablum would have been off the hook if Dre produced it, one of his real friends. I'm sure Dre would've kept it thuggish and bangin, not those corney ass beats of Eminem's. Em don't ever disrespect the GOAT, don't speak or touch upon the music you don't know nothin about. There are a couple of good tracks on here, but the rest will make u mad."
4,Check this out,"I have been 2Pac fan since Strictly 4 My Niggaz...I read reviews from some of you here and other forums and some people were complaining at the beats Eminem did so i thought oh man he killed Pacs album....I listened to the cuts from the Amazon website and thought this cd is really bad...But i of course went on to buy 2Pac Loyal to the game and was surprised this is a good cd...6 songs are All Eyez On Me material...Songs 1,2,3,7,9,12,13 are of the hook lirically and the beats are tight...Buy the cd and youll see..2Pac is a picasso on the mic"
1,A Legend's work of art vandelised,"everybody is right, this album is trash along with resurrection that eminem produced, my little sister was laughing at this album when she listened to it after all eyez on me and asked me if this was an album produced by his foes to mock him, eminem shouldnt be allowed to produce pac tracks, or atleast if he does then for gods sakes make it blend into tupacs style of rap not like his own clownshow hip-hop tracks, and PEOPLE WHO DID NOT WORK WITH TUPAC SHOULDNT BE ALLOWED TO WORK WITH HIM AT ALL and thats that, (especially 50 cent obie trice) 2pacs music and his words have been ruined with eminem and other so called ""platinum rappers"" that never even met pac, the tracks on this album sound like tracks out of a kids cartoon or eminem show and encore. if 2pac was alive he wouldve been foes with half the artists on this album"
1,Hopefully the Last Album,"I love 2pacs music and I have to say that the lyrics are hot, but part of the thing that drew me to 2pac in the first place was his choice of beats, the last none-tupac created album that I loved was Until the End of Time, some may disagree but that album was hot. This album in my opinion is rubbish. It sounds nothing like 2pac and in my opinion defiles his memory. I would rather there not be another album out. I mean I love Eminems beats as well but they are cool with his lyrics and sound not with Pacs. And it angers me when people like G-Unit, 50 (wannabe 2pac), and OB are on the album when none of them knew him, especially putting a computer animated voice over of pac saying G-Unit? That totally pisses on his memory. The Outlawz are the only ones who would deserve to be on this album. It this is how all the albums are gonna be I hope this is the last."
1,i love pac but...,"...this album sucks! the tracks don't sound like pac's music, it sounds like eminem's and though i respect eminem, i think he doesn't have a right to produce an album by tupac. and eventhough afeni let em produce this album, it doesn't mean wack. afeni is not tupac. eminem didn't know tupac and he made tupac collaborate with wack artists like obie trice and he even made tupac say g-unit! although we couldn't really say what could've happened, i'm relying on my belief that if tupac was alive, he wouldn't collaborate with em and especially g-unit. this album is not tupac. if you want to hear eminem's kind of music, then buy this album. you'll love it."
4,2pac loyal to the game,"This album is not the best since 2pac's supposed death in 1996 but it is without a doubt another 2pac masterpiece. 2 of the best rappers colide in the first track when Eminem and 2pac sing ""Soldier Like Me"""
4,This is a good cd!,"I do think that this is a good cd so all you guys quit hatin on em for trying his best to bring 2pac's work to life. There are some great songs on this cd like ""thugs get lonely too"",""out on bail"", and my favorite ""Ghetto Gospel"". I believe that if you are a true fan of 2pac's work you will still buy this album and look past the beats and listen to 2pac's amazing lyriscism and stop hatin on em for trying to keep 2pac's legacy goin."
5,UNLIKE OTHERS,"WOW - HOPEFULLY PEOPLE DONT GO BY THE REVIEWS THAT I DID, I ALWAYS PURCHASE PAC ALBUMS AND THIS IS NO DIFFERENT. LIKE JAY SAID ""DO YOU FOOLS LISTEN TO MUSIC OR DO YOU JUST SKIP THROUGH IT"". IF YOU DONT THINK THIS IS GOOD YOU ARE CRAZY, AND SHOULD PROBABLY LISTEN TO IT MORE THAN A COUPLE TIMES. AND NO EM DIDN'T MAKE THE WHOLE ALBUM, HE DOESN'T HAVE THE SKILLS YET, AND IT MIGHT SOUND LIKE SOMETHING HE WOULD SPIT ON, AND MAY BE WHY HIS ALBUM IS KINDA SOFT THIS YEAR, BUT OVERALL IT IS STILL PACS VOICE TALKING REAL, LIKE ALWAYS AND LIKE NO OTHER.-THAT'S WHY HE'S THE GREATEST, HIS LYRICS ARE REAL, AND REMAIN TIMELESS.-----I HOPE THIS REVIEW HELPED--------trust"
2,Loyal To The Game - 2pac,"First of all, 2pac is the greatest rapper of all times. I been listening to him since his first CD 2pacalypse! But I think that eminem and Afeni Shakur should stop it! Please release 2pac's songs the way they are! Why would u release them with his voice slowed down too much or voice faster than it should be just to fit the beat!The reason i gave this album 2 stars is becuz of the DJ Remixes at the end cuz they were with the original Pac's voice (Not slowed down or anything)!If u really wanna hear original 2pac, listen to his any CD fore Eminem started messin up with his stuff. Dont get me wrong, Em is a good rapper too, but he ain't gonna be Pac! He is nuthin compared to Pac and Biggie and some other rappers! He is an icon but not when he is f**kin with Pac's songs!"
5,"A very good cd, getting bad reviews due to childish ways","This album is a very well put together album. i have read many reviews saying its a bad album because pac wouldnt want em to help him. in all reality, if you sit down and listen to this album, it is really well put togehter. eminem does a good job producing it, better then i thought he would. i read from a review of another fan that said, its good to just have pacs voice on some new material. that is true, this is about as good as it is going to get since hes dead. its good to just have some new 2pac material to listen to. for everyone that cant get over the fact that eminem made this, get over yourself and listen to it. he worked with what he was given and put out some very good songs. u can sit down and listen to the whole thing and not skip a song. take this for what its worth, nothing will be as good as 2pac being alive, but you really cant do much better than this with him gone."
2,Stop it already!!,"After Better Days, it's all been downhill with these posthumous releases. They are obviously running out of material that Pac left behind. Plus, I hate seeing him get put on tracks with rappers he never knew or liked when he was living.And finally, these corny a$$ new school beats don't mix with Tupac's style. Eminem is not very good at producing.They need to get DJ Quik, Daz, DJ Battlecat or Dre on production since Johnny J is dead, who in my opinion made Pac's best beats.Until this happens, these albums are going to continue to reach new lows with each release."
2,Not as good as his first album!,This was 2pac's daily routine1) 2pac dropped his soap while he was in county jail2) 2pac bent over to pick up that soap3) 2pac took it doggystyle from the inmates4) 2pac repeats as needed
4,Can't blame eminem for tryin' his best!,"There r a lot of negative reviews sayin that Eminem ruined the songs and the beats are wack. Just listen to the beats of all other rappers present. The beats are suppose to be like this in 2005! u can't except another ALL EYEZ ON ME or ME AGAINST THE WORLD.The only problem wit the album is that on some songs vocals are slowed down too much.LOYAL TO THE GAME, THUGS GET LONELY TOO, N.I.G.G.A.S, OUT ON BAIL and CROOKED NIGGA TOO remix are good songs.If u liked RESSURECTION (soundtrack), then buy this one."
1,Not as advertised,"Just received this bumper and when I opened the box I was disappointed to find the bumper was not the same as pictured and advertised. This bumper does not have any D-ring mounts, only a smooth surfaced bumper. It's disappointing because the D-rings are the main reason I ordered this item over others.Buyer beware, you are not getting what is shown in the picture."
3,"Good For Beginers, not so Good if you know Mehndi at all.","I bought kit and was upset by the small amount of henna. The book tells you very little about creating your own henna paste; its all mixing solutions not telling you how to do it yourself.It does contain excellent transfers that allow beginners to do great tribal peices and traditional Indian peices. But the weakness of the book is it only concentrates on these designs, not training you to do your own designs."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed with the amount of henna & few transfers. I also wish the kit had a bottle with an applicator tip instead of it being it that little baggie thing. But the book is very pretty, as someone else said."
2,"Great looking watch, but lacks functionality","Bought this watch for my boyfriend, he loved it and it really looks very nice and high quality and feels it too. Unfortunately, although it should wind itself with normal use and he wore it everyday, it stopped working after about 5 months. Sent it in to Stuhrling, and they sent it back 3 weeks later and it STILL was not winding or working. It almost seemed like they hadnt even done anything! I thought maybe I just had a defective watch, but now I see others are coming back and writing reviews that same thing happened to them after a few months of use. I have sent it in a SECOND time now to be fixed, and was told that they will rush it to me but ""need time to fix it properly"". So is that now what they did the first time? Seems very sketchy to me, but we will see what kind of condition its sent back to me in this time. If its not working again, at this point I dont even think I would ask for a replacement but just a refund. We'll see."
5,Great watch - Great Company,This is a great watch and Stuhrling Originals is a great company with great customer service. I love the Skeltion Face and movement. I have 11 Stuhrling watches and love them. Remember this is an automatic and if you take it off and leave sit for a day or so it will stop and need to be reset and you will need to rewind it to restart the movement. You should wind it abt 30 to 40x when watch is being first set or restarted. Go to [...] if you have other questions to ask
4,Very Attractive Watch,"I've always wanted a skeleton watch and had been following this one for some time. My wife ended up getting it for out anniversary. This is a really nice looking watch. The blue hands really stand out against the silver parts, and I love the idea of never having to replace the battery. Overall, its a nice watch; which I use daily."
1,can't make it work..,"i just bought this and have tried for 12 hours to get it to work. the wma100 is plugged directly into the back of the wmg120, but it can't see the gateway/server.."
1,Terrible for Large Dogs!,"Purchased this in the LARGE size (MEANT FOR MEDIUM TO LARGE-SIZED DOGS) to clip my German Shepherd's nails and sorry I did. It's not sharp enough and doesn't cut well, no matter how I hold it and instead of cutting his nails, it crushes, cracks and splinters them. Judging by the way he squirmed and whined, it must hurt him too. (The guillotine version wasn't any better either.) It might work better for a smaller dog, but not for a larger one. Will not use this again. Instead, bought a Dremel brand nail grinder with a rechargeable battery pack which works wonderfully and he doesn't mind getting his nails done at all. Hope this helps some pet avoid discomfort."
5,great set of nail clippers,"I have a 4 year old Rottweiler who does NOT like having her nails trimmed. The sound from the ""Dremel-type"" filing machines only made matters worse. These clippers are strong enough for Rottie nails and the guard ensures you won't take too much off at once. It was quick and easy. Sometimes it's best to just stick to the basics."
3,Trim them nails,Works well but would like depth adjustment as for a puppy the setting built in is slightly larger than needed.
4,"nicely built, nice safety feature","Not much more to add since this has a lot of well earned good reviews. I like the safety feature--a little ""flap"" that swings over the non-cutting side of the blades to make sure you only take off a bit at a time.Just squeeze firmly and quickly and you won't have any issues with twisting your dogs nail/toe...."
2,Hard to judge where clipper is cutting,Clippers cut my 70lb Dutch Sheppard's nails easily but Hard to judge where clipper is cutting on black nails. I hit quite a few quick's. Will never use again!!
2,dropped all the time,"This device worked sometimes, but more often than not would drop data and slow to a crawl. I cannot recommend it. I'd recommend getting a wireless router, flashing with DD-WRT and setting it up as a bridge instead of purchasing this product."
1,Happy-meal network hardware,"I am in total agreement with the poor reviews of the ME101. It is a clunker of a product. I returned it after a week of fiddling and well-meaning but useless support from Netgear's phone support temps. In my case, it would only work if WEP was disabled and I used static IP addresses on client PCs behind the bridge. If the ME101 was a product released into a older, well-established market, it would be recalled immediately. It is only because consumer wireless networking is relatively new that Netgear can get away with selling this junk with a straight face. The ME101 is not worth your money."
2,"If you can replace the tube instead, do so.","I followed the instructions through step four, where I allowed the tire to fully deflate. Step five is to attach the hose and install the sealant, but I could not proceed beyond attaching the hose. The sealant would not flow through, and actually ended up on parts of the wheel and on the floor. I tried clearing out the first bit of it, then shaking the bottle to mix the contents thoroughly, then removing the the tube from the tire and rim so that I could give it one last go. I gave up after fifteen minutes of trying to fix the punctured tube and decided to instead replace it with a brand new one.I'm not sure I'll try this again any time soon."
1,Junk,"I got this stuff at Wal-mart thinking it would prevent flats, but instead it caused a flat. I followed the instructions just like it said and the first ride I went out on it was flat by the time I got back. I looked at my tire and found the hole. All the slime did was ooze out like snot. I thought maybe it just needs to dry to seal it but even after a few days it is still slimy and no good. Now I have to by a whole new tire and throw out the one with the slime I just put in it. This stuff sucks. I posted a picture."
2,Redunancy unlimited,"This book is a tired rehash of varying object relations theories and their relationship to human suffering. Dr. Summers laboriously plods through material that has been covered many times before, with greater insightfulness, by other writers. His pedestrian summaries of object relation models are leaden and uninspired. Mitchell and Greenberg's book on Object Relations Theory puts Summers book to shame. Don't buy this book, unless you can get it on a 90% off table at a local book store. Don't worry, it will be there one day!"
2,Almost stock fit,"Kit for 2005 Scion Xa rear brakes. Everything was fine, except for 2 springs. The bends on the springs were not perfect and could not be installed."
5,Got the set now,"I find that the picture quality is better in season 4 so that does tell me as the series progressed it got better in quality. All of Lexx is great, but I found season for the most funny. Bad Carrot is very funny. Of course, you have to have a favor for this type of humor, some will not like it at all. Now if you are a picture purest then you should try Farscape. The quality is great."
5,Great Poster!!!,The quality of the poster is even better than we hoped! We are putting this poster ( and others) in our sons nursery that has a Star Wars theme to it. This poster is a perfect addition:)
4,Great Book for a beginner,"I am still learning to program in java. At present time Java is an up and coming superstar... If you are a C++ programmer you had better get some Java experience. Java takes all the pain in the rear stuff out of programming, such as pointers. I hate pointers and Java doesn't use them really. I love Java security and reliability. I think this book is a good buy for the novice, and I would have given it a 5 star rating, but it should cover Swing, and JSP a little more."
3,"This book was good,but was sometimes boring.",Ducky is losing some of his best friends and his brother has got some problems.I think this was a pretty good book but the other books were a lot better.
3,I say...,"This book is pretty good, but the other ones in the series were much better. Some of the themes were cool, but for one thing, the handwriting was IMPOSSIBLE to read."
1,THE WORST OF THE SERIES!,"I have read all the other books from the Califonia Diaries series, and I think this is the worst one! I liked all the others, especially Amalia. It's cool how she tried to write about a boy for a difference, but I think she could have done better."
5,So well written,"I read the book and liked it, but I am just writing this review in refernce to a previous one. Someone wrote that nobody's life would be depressing like Ducky's. that person has got to learn a lot about life."
5,THIS IS THE GREATEST BOOK I'VE EVER READ!!!,the reason I like this book is because I can identify with Ducky's feelings. He is losing his best friends because they are changing. I have gone through that and I know what it is like. I've had his problems. I think this is a very interesting book and you should read it
1,Threw it away,"Upon receiving the Norpro Egg/Mushroom slicer I put it in the dishwasher. When the washer was finished I opened the door and to my surprise the slicer was covered with a black carbon like substance which rubbed off on my hands and the dish drying towel. I checked the box it came in and there was no warning about dishwasher use.I threw it in the garbage.I have always been pleased with Amazon,but, am now a little suspect with the reviews because this product had a lot of favorable reviews attached to it."
1,Dog Digs,"My small dog, was out in minutes, she chewed and clawed her way through the netting, I then turned it upside down, she came straight through the nylon within a few minutes, this item is absolutely worthless."
3,tedious,"Maybe I'm making a mistake but i'm also reading this authors book about Christopher Wren at the same time, written in the same style.. I'm finding the text a little broken up in both of these books with many quotes from letters, and some in the old style english,Personally i would like to have seen a more chatty, as opposed to a historical document, type of book in both cases.For me they just seem like they could be more human and interesting in both cases."
1,The worst camera I ever owned,"This was my first digital camera and also the worst I can't belive it's still offered on AmazonIt's only 1.3 MP that should be your first tip, it's slow to turn on, slow to take a photo.It eats AA batteries and it takes some of the worst photos I have ever seen.At least it never broke on me.My advice save up for a little more money and buy a real camera."
5,creepy creepy creepy,"I've been a fan of the supernatural since I was a kid. Not to say I believe in it all, but I always find myself looking into it.Daniel Cohen has to be one of the most prolific non-fiction writers out there, and this book does not disappoint. I have read several dozen 'true ghost' books and for some reason this one was one of the creepiest...perhaps since it was about children, but regardless, if you're tired of stale, encylopedia style books that don't really get into the sightings, this is the book for you."
1,Buy something else.... Not this piece of junk,My wife purchased one for our 2 year old... It worked great for the first 3 nights. We wanted one that had a rumble to it ( powerful fan ). However after night three it began to squeak. This squeak was so loud that it woke us all up and my wife and I are 40 feet away behind a closed door. We thought that wa just had a defective unit so we returned it to our local Walmart and got another one.Go figure the next one was the exact same way... I'll be contacting Holmes about this P.O.S.
1,If you like planes you'll love this humidifier!!,"I too must add to the loud chorus of disappointed purchasers of this humidifier that sounds like a small jet engine. The instruction booklet proudly proclaims that the fan motor is made by GE, well GE also makes jet engines and I think someone got a little confused when they designed this one. Listen to all the reviews and don't waste your time or money!"
1,I was fooled by nice tower design,"This thing deserves a 0 Star. This humidifier is terribly noisy. The noise is not unlike that of a small tractor or jet engine. No kidding! I thought that perhaps I incorrectly reattached the water tank, tray, or something... There's no way you can sleep at night with this thing running. Bought at Target for $60. Expensive but thought that ""you get what you paid"" for. Apparently not in this case. Used it for only one day and is very annoyed by the loud noise. Water tray and parts are awkwardly designed also. Attachment assembly seems unsafe. Fire the design team that came up with this model! Gonna return it."
1,Not much to like,"I really wanted to like this book. New author, medical thriller, right up my alley. However I read about 1/3 and just had to stop. It was terrible, writing was awful, totally unrealistic. I almost can't believe the author is a physician. There are just too many wonderful books out there to waste your time on this dud. If you want a book with a medical context, check out ""Cutting For Stone"" which is spectacular."
1,Do not even pick this book up if you're a kid,"This book is written in easy enough language, but it's not for kids. Unless you already know about Native Americans and gambling and their tendancy towards alcoholism and the concerns Native Americans have about casinos ruining their way of life when you're 12, you should bypass this book. Ugh."
4,Heart of a Chief,"My class just read Heart of a Chief. i would give this book 4 stars because it was good but some parts I didn't understand.It is about a Penacook kid named Chris Nicola who lives on a reservation. He is starting middle school and the town decided to build a casino on a nearby island. My favorite part is when he takes the stakes and burned them. I learned that anyone can make a difference.By,Jimmy S."
4,Samantha - Love and Justice By Rique Johnson,"A must read book - I haven't read a book like this in quite sometime. Love and Justice is filled with passion, deceit, suspense and all the good things that makes a reader want more. I couldn't sit it down - I needed to get to the next page/chapter. I'm just waiting for the next book to come in July"
5,Non-Stop Reading,"What an exciting, intriging, can't-put-it-down, type book. I read it in one day because it was so fascinating. It had love, crime, and interpersonal relationships that kept me on the edge of my seat. I can't wait for the sequel. Thanks Rique!"
1,Dangerous product-- Please do not use!!!!,"Our little mouse died because we used this bedding.The ""grass"" in this product is long strands of tough, thin, fibers--like a tangle of long, tiny wires.The day after we put some of this stuff in with our smallest mouse, I noticed that he hadn't moved in several hours from the center of a clump of the bedding.Looking closer, I saw that there were strands of grass wound tightly around his back right leg, which had become horribly distended in his efforts to free himself. The grass was also wrapped around his neck and other limbs, trapping him completely.After several minutes of careful snipping, I was able to free our dear little mouse, but it was too late. He died shortly thereafter. Whether it was his inability to reach food and water while trapped, the mangling of his poor leg, or the stress of the whole ordeal that killed him, we don't know. But we greatly regret putting this sweet little creature in such peril."
4,GREAT PRODUCT,THIS PRODUCT ISNT EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR BUT IT SERVED THE SAME PURPOSE AND IT WORKED VERY WELL FOR ME
2,Navy Brat Should be Titled Navy Bad,"This series of books was originally published in the early 90's and probably should have been left alone after that initial publication. From the first, the outcome of this book was predictable. But, what could have been an interesting change-of-heart story; turned into a series of whining sessions. The lead female doesn't deserve her male counterpart. Her character continuously sings the sorry tune of self pity. She was truly obnoxious. By the end of the book, I wanted the Lieutenant to marry ANYBODY else. This book gets two stars for the subplots and the the perfect Lieutenant. I was disappointed with this book. Debbie Maccomber usually delivers better stories."
2,Spare yourself the cost of this book,"What a depressing novel. But of course I am not an alcoholic and I doubt that I fully understand what someone goes through that suffers from this disease. Nevertheless, I found myself turning the pages because I wanted to finish the book, not because I was enraptured with Block's fabulous story telling or his pathetically depressing protagonist. Ugh."
3,Doesn't stand on its own,"While I found this a reasonably well-written text, I judge a book based upon how well it stands on its own - that is, can I read the book, work through the exercises, and acquire a grasp of the topic. While this is a much clearer and more accessible intro to geometric algebra than Hestene's ""Clifford Algebra to Geometric Calculus"", it is more the type of book which would accompany a class in GA, where the instructor fills-in the gaps, rather than a stand-alone text. The worked exercises are relatively few, and are typically of the nature: start with this, magic, more magic, resulting answer. It lacks sufficient explanation, is not self-contained, but this can be partially overcome with additional resources."
5,Excellent place to start learning Clifford Algebra.,A briliantly pedagogical introduction to Clifford Algebra as a unified algebraic language for Newtonian Mechanics in three dimensions. The book is full of applications and nonstandard approaches which simply cannot be found anywhere else. This is essential reading for anyone interested in Clifford Algebras or who wants a deeper appreciation for classical mechanics. This is a lot of book...
1,do not buy this,Time Enough for Love is among the greatest novels ever written in the English language. This is but a scant few pages taken from that wonderful work. Do not buy this instead buy Time Enough for Love which is amazing.
1,Get the print version if you can find it,i am glad I downloaded the sample rather than purchasing this. Had this been scanned from the original book with all of the illustrations and caligraphy intact it would be worth it. In its present fom of plain text and poor layout it is horrible.
1,surprised to say the least,"as a fan of these three gentlemen over the past thirty years or so, i find myself shocked to utter disbelief that they would dare release such utter garbage to the listening public.shame on you,gentlemen. shame on you!"
1,bubble gun rap ?,"It wasnt bad enuff dat cam started to wear pink like a fag and now his album cover is purple and buble gun like ?! Are you sirious? What the f*ck even rap is turning ? Luckily this is just the homo rap mainstream like nelly femine, gay unit, and P*ssy set p*ssy set ! Mann, cam'ron's ""purple haze"" doesnt deserv 1 start but hey ain no zero option. Im i the only one who can see that cam used to be good but now he been and done fell off a while ago and he tryna go against mase ? Even Mase is harder the cam and Mase a christian. Cam and p*ssy set all homos. Juelz santana is one of the worse mc's ever he dont even deserv to be called an rapper let along mc. Peace !"
1,Frooti Tooti?,"Camron is not a good rapper at all.His lyrics are so wack...i mean if i got all these hot beats from just blaze, the diplomats, and kanye west i would not use garbage lyrics like frooti tooti, computer love, etc.get this cd if u think u like rapbut this is not true hip hop...for rela hip hop cop the game cd the documentary"
1,Cam'ron is WACK!!,"Do not buy this CD. He is definitely wack. His silly rhyme style and dull voice sounds lethargic over uninspired beats. As a member of ""Children of the Corn"" he was weak and he still is weak. The other member of his Dip-Set Crew outshine him on his own CD...how lame is that. Through away any Cam'ron cd's you own and immediately replace them with music by Jay-Z."
2,CAM'RON CANT RAP.,"After listening to this entire album, if I never hear Cam'Ron ever again it will be too soon. Someone needs to tell Cam that he really cant rap. He sounds the same on every song he's ever done (ever). Same goes for Juelz Santana and Jim Jones (even though I like Jimmy Jones the best outta the three). The beats are ""ok"" but they, too, sound like evey beat on every other Diplomat related album, ever. These guys are REALLY REPETITIVE. And they talk about girls and their great prowess over the ladies waaaaayyyy too much. Cam'Ron states that he's ""taking over the Roc"". If thats ttrue, Roc-A-Fella is in serious trouble. He's is not eveb CLOSE to being the best artist on the Roc. Remember, they have Memphis Bleek, Beanie Sigel (if he ever gets outta jail for shooting that guy in the stomach. Smart)and Kanye West...all of whom spit way hotter fire than Cam'Ron. This album is terrible."
5,his album should been out in february.,"This album should been out in february. But it was delayed and came out on december 7. Cam'r on is good. It getts 3 out of 5. good tracks like girls,killa cam, Family Ties, and Get 'Em Girls."
4,Worth the wait,"Excellent cd. Great production. If only the diplomats had prodtuction like this on their cds....Even the skits are good. I don't know if I'm ready to give out 5 stars, but this cd is definetly bumpin' I'm glad that I hadn't heard a whole lot of the songs before (as had ben the ususal case with preious dipset-redlated cds). I'm impressed. Very, cvery impressed. keep up the good work"
1,?,"The sad part is this isnt a joke. Roc-a-Fella is actually pushin Cam. I'll admit I fell for it at first with ""Come Home With me"" which is still ""alright"" to me. But i realised to formula as soon as i sat down and actually LISTENED to what cam was rapping about. Nothing. Cam'Ron just masks his wackness with Well-Produced tracks. I've never rapped in my life, but I bet if i got beats like cam does, i could flow better than him. wtf @ ""That Tooti Fruiti, Louie Doodie, Hootie Hoo!?"" I honestly dont know what else to say.I mean....(Sigh) I remember a time when Cam'Ron actually rapped this on Diplomatic Immunity. ""[....] it, Bucket by Osh Kosh B'Gosh/ Golly I'm Gully/ Look at his galoshes""I Rest My Case."
2,PRAXIS/CST School Psychology,"Parts of this book were helpful but most of it is related to general psychology rather than school psychology. It did not address much of the content that is required for school psychology. This book is arranged in a way that makes it difficult to use. Very technical questions. This book consists of questions and answers only, no discussion."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!,"This book was out of date when I was in graduate school 30 years ago. This is especially disturbing because the NASP exam hasn't been around that long. Not only are the test editions obsolete, but there are many questions based on psychoanalytic theory,answers based on discredited theory (e.g. etiology of homosexuality, and answers that are simply incorrect. It looks as if the author stuck some very old exams together without much concern about their relevance to current practice or NASP guidelines."
1,Avoid this item,"This review refers to the NTE/PRAXIS edition (actually, it is an older edition, NTE/PRAXIS is a label pasted over the original title). Some of the information in this ""thing"" was obsolete in 1975! WISC-R, moron/idiot/imbecile, ""Compared to the 1937 Stanford-Binet Scale..."", ""retarded"". It seems to be every item from every Praxis exam that anyone has ever taken, ever. The Thompson book is much better, but a lot has changed since 2004 and it too contains some incorrect information - but it's worth buying. On-line NASP and ETS info seem to be the best out there."
3,Difficult,A difficult book to read. It is composed of interrelated essays and brings poststructuralist analysis of the current political situation to the fore. Very good for scholars dealing with the desection of the postmodern but offers little advice to those struggling for a better life.
3,Ok,"Shipping was fast and the DVD's where in good condition, the only problem was that it had DVD's 1-5 and instead of DVD 6 there was DVD 7 from Box Set 2."
1,Shrill and silly,"I found it hard to believe that someone who admits to not ""understand why people climb"" and to be ""terrified"" of America's favorite weekend climb would endeavor to write a book about Rainier. Barcott says many silly things in order to make up for poor research and sloppy editing, but his humor strikes me as being of the adolescent ""look at me, I can swear, Ma"" than, well, funny. I would definately give this sorry tale a miss. Rainier deserves better."
3,An Exhausting Stroll Around the Pool,"The Measure of a Mountain is an account of author Barcott's adolescent crush on Mt. Rainier. Having personally experienced the siren-like alure of this great Cascade volcano, I fully understand and appreciate the research it inspired, and, simultaneously, I must ponder the rational behind the author selecting an RMI jaunt up Rainier's sole dog run as some kind of culminating endeavor?Bruce, baby, without charging you a dime, I could have walked you right up Fuhrer Finger, the Kautz, or, better still, the South Tahoma Glacier 'schrund where that tragic flight was entombed, and I have no doubt you declined similar offers. Lover's leap. You didn't even hop."
2,Froth and Bubble,"The shots and the situations are amazing but this is a very superficial look at the photographic process. Fine for kids or the average channel-surfer, but if you're tempted by the National Geographic name and a want a genuine behind the scenes look at how these shots get made then, unfortunately, this is not it."
1,Failed in less than a year,"Well, at first I thought I had a dead battery. So I started to order another battery. Which I did.But then I started thinking. I sure would like one of the standard Canon chargers that just plugs into the wall. And then I started to wonder if maybe the charger was just not good.Sure enough, I got the new battery and the new Canon charger. First thing I did was put my old ""dead"" battery into the Canon charger. Guess What? It wasn't dead! After charging for an hour, it worked great.I'm not even sure this charger ever really charged it right, for a while it always seemed to have ""less charge"" than normal.Glad I spent extra and got the real Canon charger this time around."
3,Recording function is totally useless,"I purchased this device right after it first appeared, and it works well as an MPG player. It is much bulkier than my iPod, and the recording function, one of the reasons I purchased this device is all but useless. In it's attempt to ensure it's customer don't steal anything, like their own voice recordings, dell has made it so that there is no way to transfer audio from the device to the PC. This effectively makes the recording function useless. If you want a device that records, don't buy this!"
4,Adoptive parents should be cautious,"Two of the stories mention adopted children in an unfavorable light. I know this is just old-fashioned language, but I hope it's changed in the next edition of this book. Otherwise, the stories were sweet and the illustrations were lovely.""The Great Flood"" involves a woman with two daughters, ""her real daughter"" and an adopted one -- ""Now the old woman's own daughter was very much the more beautiful of the two girls.""In ""The Green Leaf,"" an adopted son lies about his father and gets him imprisoned, although they are reconciled in the end: ""The youth had learned his lesson. Not only once, but twice, had his life been saved by his foster father. From then on, he became a changed person and grew into a good man."""
5,"Africa,a 2003 reality check.","Once again,a personal,meaningful, sensitive and intensely provocative review revisiting central Africa,besides a fresh honest look at the Nile,Islam,Ethiopia and finally South Africa.New ideas,seeing whats happened in 40 years and to me AT LAST honestly asking what,how,even why 'FOREIGN AID'needs to be re-evaluated?It takes courage to do what he did to make this book possible,and it is an important,timely and valuable review for us here who forget the gap between 1st and 3rd Worlds is rapidly widening.Well Done,Paul!"
2,He has completed his transition,"Theroux was becoming a grouch and a crab in Pillars of Hercules. His writing was going downhill then and now he is complete. He is mocking, sniggering, back-stabbing and complaining the whole time. He is nastily anti-Christian and insults them to their face and in print. He makes snide remarks about people who go to Africa to see the animals, ""pestering"" in his words, and then hypocritically proceeds to go to a luxury resort that few of us could afford and .... sees the animals. Theroux is an elitist who looks down his nose at most of the rest of us. Lots of tedious passages in this book, reading about this breakdown, that flat tire, etc.Only valuable part of this book is the heartbreaking view of the poverty in Africa that is being made worse, not better, by the aid we have been sending. There are other books that are worth reading. This is the last book of his I will buy and I used to be a real fan."
1,A grim and tiresome experience,"No, really, can't they do better than this? You would have to be 12 years old and with a snail-sized brain to get anything out of this movie. Naked girls in showers? So what's new?"
1,Completely boring!,I saw this movie on HBO along time ago hoping that it would be good. But it wasn't it was really dumb. It's about a couple of guys who sees naked girls in the showers. If you want to see a funny movie go rent American Pie which is better than this trashy movie. Porky's is rated R. It looks more like an NC-17 movie to me.
1,Truth in advertising?,What I received is not what I ordered. I ordered the unrated version but received the r-rated version. So much for truth in advertising.
3,FUNNY IS THE KEY WORD HERE!,5 stars? No. But 3 is alot considering the plot and characters. The ending was everything I had hoped for but the space in the middle of the film was space gone to waste....Or was it? Do I know what I'm talking about? Of course I do. That scene in the Principals office with the fat chick and the two coach's was absolutely HILARIOUS!!!! and that Mike Hunt thing was funny too...Pee Wee is just funny as so he was in the other 2 Porky's movies and along with Up The Creek. I really found this to being a funny movie. Really. Check it out.
3,dougv,"Interesting at first to hear interview comments by the basketball players, butthe interviews become tedious. I shut the documentary off after about a half hour.A film not worth buying.I wanted to see the players learning to be a team and and the success when theywon, such as the movies ""Glory"", ""Hoosiers"" and ""Edge of America"", which was agreat film about a black coach teaching American Indian girls. Another good film:""Believe In Me"". Don't miss these movies."
4,Teaches you the mechanics of E-Trading,"This book teaches you the mechanics of E-Trading, from how to select the right broker, how to do research, how to make your trades, how to track your portfolio, even how to complain when things go wrong. There is about a 30 page appendix of useful websites. If you're looking for a book which teaches you how to select stocks via fundamental or technical analysis, keep looking, you're not going to find those topics in this book."
1,Every Breath You Take,"I was disappointed in Judith McNaught's book Every Breath You Take. During the first part of the story, the characters seemed more from the 80's, and the plot had hard-to-believe twists. Towards the end, the story reads like it was a rough draft.I skimmed much of the last part just to get through it. I like Judith McNaught's books, but this one doesn't come close to matching her storytelling ability in the others."
5,Another excellent read by Judith McNaught,"When I read a romance novel I want to get ""lost"" in the story and the characters and that is exactly what Judith McNaught does with EBYT. I couldn't put it down until I was finished. I loved the bantering between Mitchell & Kate. The secondary characters was equally interesting. I could only ask for More! Please! :). You will not be disappointed with this or any other Judith McNaght book! She is WONDERFUL!!"
3,"Good book, but not complex","I dont believe that Judith Mcnaught could ever write a bad novel, and though this book provided a good story, it lacked spark. Though we were able to see how they fell in love and why, the chemistry between the two characters seemed to be lacking and the heroine is not portrayed as a strong, unique individual that we typically see in Mcnaught's novels. However this was a great story and definitely believable. Definitely one to add to the collection if you are a Mcnaught's fan and she even brings back the characters from some of her other contemporary novels."
3,Good start - horrible finish,"I personally haven't cared for JM's contemporary novels as much as her historicals, but this one is just poorly written...**SPOILERS**I had high hopes for the book after the fist half. I felt the magic of the main characters budding romance. However, as soon as the ""big misunderstanding"" happened, the story became disjointed (jumped ahead years...), went off on tangents (10+ pages dedicated to Mitchell's assistants chatting about absolutely nothing importing to the storyline...) and had completely nonsensical spots (who goes out on a date the day after their kid was kidnapped?)Also, I think Kate really messed up by not telling Mitchel about the pregnancy. I think he had a right to be mad at her for a very long time.All in all, I think this is my least favorite McNaught book ever. I hate to say that I think she's lost her touch. The stories have become very similar or predictable.3 stars for the first half, 0 for the rest of the book."
1,Disappointed,Loved this book the many times I read it in the past. I am disappointed that the updated version contains so much profanity. Is that what it takes for people to enjoy a book today? Its a complete turn off to me.
1,Very disappointed,"Like a lot of reviewers here, I am disappointed at Ms McNaught's last 5 novels and EBYT was the worst. I have stopped buying her new novels now as I have always been disappointed lately (just been borrowing them from the library). The last good book that she's written was Perfect. Every book from then on was just not up to scratch. I miss the romance that she used to write. I just don't understand why romance novelists these days try to write crime fiction. The reason why authors like Judith McNaught became popular in the first place was the great way they wrote romance novels. If I wanted to read about murder and other sad stuff, I would go and read James Patterson, Mary Higgins Clark and others. Please!!! Please write about romance again."
2,Frustrating Read,"The difficult part of reading this book was the poor character development and the lack of resolution with storylines. Kate's uncle tells us that she reads people very well, so thus was able to determine Mitchell was a ""good"" guy after knowing him for 2 days. Why then, was she unable to see Evan's darker side after 4 years of dating? Why did Mitchell not want children with his first wife, but was more than willing to have several with Kate? What changed him? Why was Kate's mother not a factor in her life? Was her father randomly killed or was it murder? A very frustrating read. I skimmed the last 50 pages to get it over with."
3,"""Dark""?-You Ain't Seen Dark","I'd call this book ""dark"" if I didn't think that there are a few black midnights that would be offended by the comparison; O'Connell has created a world out of an imagined rusted-out New England mill town that swarms with the seedy leavings of every diaspora from every tragedy-rich old world hell-hole that never was. He's mixed them up with a heavy dose of local mythology and a horrific murder mystery to leave a place so creepy, so filled with the bent and the broken of humanity, that keeping score is ultimately pointless and a net of fears seems to settle on everyone. Great Fun, actually! O'Connell writes so noir that Chandler comes across as a sissy, while his two-fisted hero suffers stoically perhaps the most improbable and unpleasant torture outside of ""Marathon Man"" Not his best, but fans of O'Conell have to ride the rap that he's created over the last few years in ""Box 9"", ""Wireless"" and ""The Skin Palace""."
2,Neither fish nor fowl,"I love good mysteries. This book is not a good mystery. Reminds me more of a rather silly romance novel. It is sort of a throw in the kitchen sink and call it done. The CIA, genius kid, horse whisperer devoted mom who can only focus on how hot she is,and a paramilitary hero larger than life. Badly written. Will not buy another book by this author."
2,Where have you hidden Iris Johansen?,"I've loved Iris Johansen for ages, but this book was really bad. It almost seemed as if she had it ghost written by a high school student. The dialog was stilted and silly, the characters irritated me and were totally unreal, and I don't know where Johansen learned about horses, but there is something strange about her description of an eight-year-old jumping a stallion. The earlier reviewer hit it right: The book almost seems like Johansen got tired of thinking so took a variety of cliche-type plot lines and hooked them together. I thought if I heard one more time about how ""special"" Frankie was, I would be sick - especially since the only thing special about her seemed to be how very badly she was written.Come back, Iris Johansen. I miss you."
1,That's it I'm done with her,"I used to love Iris Johansen's books esp. her Eve Duncan books. The last few though have been terrible. On the Run was the final straw, she's lost me as a reader. I read about 100pgs and gave up. The plot was so dumb I can't believe she got someone to publish it."
5,Three great steps in understanding the Y2K Mystery,This author has compiled a really down to earth description of the Y2k in detail and is very easy to understand. The check list and many resources of reference are outstanding. Once I started reading I just had to keep reading to completion -- really fascinating! Congratulations to the author on this excellant presentation! It certainly will be helpful for any family in their ability to make preparation decisions.
3,Over all pretty good,"I got this thing so that I could use my Verizon internet card on my desk top, as I live in the boonies and we dont even have phone lines. I had a little trouble while first installing it, after putting it in the computer and turning the computer on I was getting the ""beep code"" turned it off then back on a couple times and it finally caught on. It didnt want to read the card that I put in it at first either. Had to shutdown and reboot yet again. But after that everything else seems to work fine. The other thing that you should probably know about this thing is that it forces you to put the card in upside down... nothing really wrong with that unless you have certain disorders. FYI, It kind of drives me nuts. But over all it seems to work well no problems since it was recognized properly. Enjoy"
5,"Wonderful, moving story!",An excellent story with many emotional events. The story fellows a lifetime and is truly wonderful reading material!!
2,"pretty good, but not worth reading if it isn't assigned","I read this book for extra credit in my english class last year. I started it with high hopes, but as the chapters plodded along I got more and more annoyed with the unessesary descriptions and way-too-mellow scenes. Nothing really happened in this book. The most interesting part is when they move. ooh, fun. i would not reccomend this book at all. If it's on your summer reading, choose another book!"
4,It All Comes Back to the Land,"This is the saga of Chinese farmer Wang Lung's life on the land in northern China. From desperate peasant to renowned landowner, Wang Lung's fortunes are tied directly to the earth he tills. This is no mere physical connection, Wang Lung's spirit is tied to the land too. Whenever he finds himself despairing, tired of life, or travelling down the wrong path, the land renews him, and reinvigorates his spirit.Buck writes about a rural Chinese community with remarkable sympathy. She explains the worldview of an early-twentieth century Chinese farmer well, particularly to a largely unknowing English-speaking audience. That said, I did sometimes feel like the land theme was sometimes overdone. Still, and interesting and worthwhile read."
5,Excellent,"You have to give this book full marks just for the fact that a Western woman wrote this book from a Chinese man's point of view living in China. To my mind, she gets him spot on - his views, passions, irritants - and the constant turns in the story keep one's interest alive throughout. So many books dip in the middle and lose track. This one stays on course throughout to the very logical end. The terrible lot of Chinese women is non-judgemental and sensitively told and for that and for many other reasons it was a worthy Pulitzer prize winner."
2,"Well, the language was good...but where's the feel?","Like many others, I was forced to read this book for school. Since then, I've read it a few more times. My conclusion? Even through Buck may have resided and grown up in China, she never really developed a sense of what it was like. She knew her facts, but not once in this book did I ever feel that she caught the essence, the ebb and flow, of the Chinese culture (yes, I am of Chinese descent, 1st generation immigrant).Mark Salzman did a much better job of capturing the ""Chinese feel"" in *The Laughing Sutra.* So did Sheryl Wudunn and Nicholas Kristoff in *China Wakes.* Both books are ones I highly recommend.As for *The Good Earth,* write your papers and put it away. I don't even consider it decent American literature."
4,A truly timeless novel,"I recently read this novel for a book report. I am only in 8th grade, so I may not have grasped all the concepts of this book completely, but I still understand it and still believe it to be one of the greatest books I've read. Wang Lung's humble devotion to his land is the main reason I love it so much, even though O-lan was my favorite character. The ending was a little shocking and sad, which is the only reason I gave it a 4. It's a must read for any age!"
3,The Good Earth,"Pearl Bucks ""The Good Earth"" gives us her slant of life in 19th Century China via the life story of Wang Lung, a poor peasant farmer who rises above his lot in life to become a wealthy landowner. Written in a straightforward manner, easy to follow and comprehend, it trots along at a sufficient pace to maintain the readers' interest. Her benign approach to story telling never taints the subject matter with personal bias or opinion, always remaining true to culture and tradition of life in China as she saw it. Overall it's a good book."
1,I did not enjoy The Good Earth,"I have just finished reading The Good Earth . It is about a man named Wang Lung and his struggle to be happy and to have a prosperous life. He needs to earn for his family and keep them alive through famine, drought, and hard times. Once he has money he thinks he will be happy. Many things then happen to him and he then learns that money doesn't buy happiness. Personally I didn't like the book. It was a good novel and well written I just did not enjoy the topic. You may enjoy it. It depends on the kind of writing you like. China is not something I enjoy reading about. My favorite part of the book was the way it ended. I won't tell you how but I will say that it left something to be imaged. For some The Good Earth would be important to read. It teaches many lessons about life and happiness. One who needs to learn this will need to read the book. It has taught me some lessons I will never forget. I hope you enjoy reading The Good Earth."
5,Very enjoyable,"I found this book to be very easy to read and am fascinated with the characters. Wang Lung's story is raw and brutal. Following Lung's development, I found myself liking him, pitying him, loving him, despising him, forgiving him, and accepting him."
1,I very well enjoy it because of the very boring text.,"There is only one word to describe this book, ""terrible!!!"" I wish I can go back in time and diminish all the words written in this absolutely dull book."
4,Life Itself,"The Good Earth is not a travelog that will transport you to the beauty & wonders of other lands. It is a travelog of life itself, its bittersweet joys, & hardships. It is a classic for this & many other reasons. Those who didn't like the it & stopped reading after 25 pgs. were right to do so. They wouldn't have liked the rest. Those who say they didn't learn anything from the book were also right. You can't learn anything from this book because it talks about life lessons. And the only way for each of us to learn those is by making our own mistakes and being taught by the hardest teacher of all, life itself.When someone is able to appreciate the beauty of life as a journey, with it's good & bad along the way, I recommend this book to them, especially the Enriched Classic edition by Pocket Books. It has great introduction & notes that enhance the reading of the book. It may also be available at your library."
4,Compelling Epic,"""The Good Earth"" by Pearl S. Buck was a compelling read. I thoroughly was overcome by the diversity and frugalness of Wang Lung at the beginning of the story. His quiet humility in the start of the book over his young new wife.This book held my interest for days. I could not put it down. I wanted to see how life progressed for this famil.y It appeared that Wang Lung through his humility and meagerness that he began to prosper. Thus, turning his small beginning with the purchase of a piece of land into a mighty clan."
4,Good book I enjoyed,"The book came with the cover tore but the book was a great read, I read with the book club I am in and everyone was really talking about the book."
1,minimally interesting,"This book was not as appealing to me as I thought it might be, while it contained good description and thoughtful poetically written material, it lacked writing that would hold a reader's attention. The most well written and most readable section of the book occurs as the Wang family is plagued by starvation and moves to the city so that they might still continue to survive. The Good Earth does contain themes that express the authors views on morality and humanity, and thus I consider it to be an important book, which should be read by all whom wish to do so. While it was not one of my favorite novels, I was able to learn much about the Chinese culture and way of life which is very interesting. The book contains important ideas, but these ideas have been overly expressed in written works of the past, so in general I would suggest that anyone interested in the themes and subjects should read this book."
1,Do not Buy!,"Hello,I thought this would be an informative DVD to improve my Interviewing and Interrogating skills. As the other reviewer wrote, it looked like a poorly done old movie and they did not even finish the interviews or the investigation. The whole thing just ended as if there were a second part or another disc.HIGHLY NOT recommended."
1,OUTDATED PRACTICES,"The setting is 1960's and the interviewing/interrogation style would not be accepted by today's standards. It seemed like I was watching a boring old ""Dragnet"" TV series episode. I bought this hoping to get something to help my students learn basic interviewing and interrogation skills, but I ended up using it to demonstrate what NOT to do."
3,Too much for this humble reviewer.,"There are parts of this book that I liked. I think those are the ones about which I have some firsthand knowledge. It is good to see someone writing layman's articles about quantum physics and special relativity. But all that guff about 'The Wizard Of Oz'? Trying to cram so much erudition into one book leaves Mr.Gardner looking somewhat pompous and self-opinionated AND leaves the rest of us feeling just a little dumb. So, I suppose the question must be, who was this book written for? How many people can there be in North America who can understand and heaven forbid, critique the all-knowing Mr.Gardner?"
3,"More info, Please.","At the time that I write this, the product description is non-existant. All I have to go by is a tiny thumbnail picture...The ""Customer Reviews"" software is asking me how I rate this item... I can't make an honest review until I know more about the product... I'm giving it an average rating across the board... for now. :-(One of my hobbies is entertaining with balloon sculptures. I've had good days where I can *wow* the crowds with my sculptures, and I have had bad days where I was trying out some new balloons, and they kept popping on me...I would like more information about the product and the contents before I plunk my money down on the counter... Who makes this item, how many of the Rocket Balloons are in the package, etc...Can the seller please give a better description of the product? Thanks!"
4,Bridget's Review,"Liselle has met the man of her dreams. The problem is, she is married to someone else. When she sees Charlie, a fire ignites and the passion she feels is something her husband has never given her. Liselle realizes that life is short and true love is a wonderful emotion. The affair begins.Finally knowing what it feels like to really live, Liselle decides to document the lives of average, everyday people. Soon she finds out that in order to express the lives of others, she also needs to confess her own life story.One word: riveting."
1,"Grow Up, Mona","A book called ""Useful Idiots,"" written by an idiot for idiots. Mona is so dimwitted she has to rely on the old ""blame the liberals"" game. In Mona's perfect world we would go back to the ""good ole days"" of McCarthyism, segregation and female supression. Get a life, Mona."
1,"Should Be Titled ""Useless Author""","Short sighted, paranoid and sophomoric, this is just what Rush Limburger fans will love. You really get the sense that she loves to listen to herself. If you must read it, borrow it and save some money."
1,Shame!,"I used to read Charen's column years ago as a harmless diversion. And over the years, I've come to find her to be another hate-filled person who spews her venom on anything and anyone that she doesn't agree with. This is the sort of thinking that leads to bigotry, Inquisitions, and the auto-da-fe!! I'm sorry, but the expression of a difference with the powers-that-be does not make one a traitor to one's country (unless you wish to include Jefferson, Washington, Adams, etc in the list), but rather oftentimes shows the highrest regards for the principles upon which this blessed country was founded.At last, how sad it is that there are people who are so limited as to think that this sort of baiting and name-calling is an acceptable mode of expression in the 21st century. As an American and as a human being, this woman should be ashamed of herself!!"
2,"Interesting, but simplistic and just wrong","The author does a good job of documenting the quotations and actions of political and celebrity figures who have either idealizedcorrupt and evil regimes (U.S.S.R., Cuba, Pol Pot's Cambodia, the former North Vietnam) or who, if they condemn them, must always add some criticism of the U.S.However, she uses the term ""liberals"" over and over without defining what that term means to her. This is an anti-intellectual approach and more appealing to the emotions. In addition, she minimizes the damages of McCarthyism (suggesting it lasted ""just"" four years and damaged a small number of people). She also blows off Watergate in about two sentences. She needs some more history lessons. I wish I had waited for the library copy."
3,Freudian slip?,"Reviewing Charen's book, the anonymous reader from Nebraska writes:""Believes that anyone who does not hold her beliefs must be a liebral.""Liebral, liberal. It's all about semantics."
5,Need More Irenics,"I did enjoy this book, even though I'm not on either one of the opposing sides --- even though I'm neither left-wing nor right-wing, but in that vast, silent middle. I have to tell you, however, all these polemical books, both left and right, are becoming very tiring to me. We probably would do better to throw them all away and start over, re-institute the standard, go back to reading more unifying, objective, enlightening books such as McCullough's ""John Adams"", or Remick's ""West Point..."". After all, we're all Americans. What we need is more irenics and less polemics."
4,Serious Compilation of Mistaken Believers,"I will often clip a quote or comment out of a newspaper and send it off to a friend or family-member. ""How could someone ostensibly intelligent say something so dumb?"" Mona Charen has compiled an entire book of intelligent people saying dumb things, and she shows that this is not adventitious, but the result of an ideology that blinds some liberals to America's virtues and from Communism's bloody vices. The book bogs down now and then as Ms. Charen details leftist muddle-headedness, but pick up any chapter on any topic and there are head-shakers that will have you muttering at the lack of common sense of some of our politicians, intellectuals, entertainers.For another point of view, see Tampa, Fl's review down below.He constantly calls Ms. Charen a ""facist"". I wish he had explained what a ""facist"" is. Someone who does not wear a mask?"
3,bad title- good book,"I only wish the title and the cover were different. Though it is easy to see the connection after reading only a couple chapters, the title makes one think that it is a typical ""left-bashing"" book, which it isn't. The author makes quite convincing arguments about our perceptions of atrocities are being (and have been) manipulated by the press and hollywood. The book prompted me to research some of her claims for more information and that is what a good book is supposed to do. I was impressed with how the book flowed from one event to another.I recommend taking the time to read this, regardless of your politics, as the history is presented well."
2,Old News,"""Useful Idiots"" is simply a re-hash of what most informed Americans already know. I was dismayed that Charen seemed surprised that after all the evidence is presented, so-called ""liberals"" still blame America first and refuse to denounce the evils of Communism. What Charen doesn't, or refuses to realize, is the end goals of liberals and Communists are the same. Ann Coulter knows it and has outed the liberals in her books ""Treason"" and ""Slander"". Coulter's books are far superior to Charen's."
3,pretty good material..pretty terrible recording quality,I have the PROGRESSIVE LINE copy of this CD....it's pretty obvious that the bootlegger referred to store bought cassette for his source.....the tape had been apparently mangled in a couple of spots and you can hear the highs fall in and out.....there is an unnatural amount of hiss throughout....It's just a terrible shame that the legal issues are preventing a legit remastered verion...along with bonus tracks...to be released.....it is probably the weakest effort by Strawbs..but for those who like the band.....it is an integral addition to their collection...We can only hope for a legal resolution....as far as the rating??? 4 stars for the effort...and 2 stars for the recording quality.
3,Track List,1. Highway 492. Dust My Broom3. Rockin' The Blues4. Forty-Four5. Do The Do6. Little Red Rooster7. All My Life8. I Didn't Mean To Hurt Your Feelings9. Howlin' For My Darlin'10.

1,Very Disappointed!,"I was very excited about receiving a copy of the original Mildred Pierce prior to the airing of the mini series on HBO. That is... until I received it. The book was musty, the pages brown and dry rotted and as I turned some pages, they fell out of the book. Needless to say, not a happy camper. Would not purchase from this seller again."
4,The ultimate Teen Slasher flick! A horny monster with a sense of humor....awesome!,"Get a case of beer and invite some buddies over to enjoy some laughs, gore and hot naked babes getting nailed by the sexed up Werewolf/stepdad/stand up comedian."
4,Big Bad Wolf Wasn't So Bad...,"not too bad. the acting was good. the nudity and rape scene weren't necessary and the movie could have carried well without it, but is expected in b movies so it wasn't a big shock. it was kind of fun and campy. it was an okay movie, what made the movie was the campiness though. to enjoy the movie you have to be a into horror b films. that's exactly what this is, so expect nothing more, but that doesn't make it a bad movie as long as you know what your getting."
4,A reminder...,"...of just how brilliant Mr. Zevon was at songwriting. The performances vary, but the songs are uniformly excellent."
5,a great CD,"This is a fantastic CD. There are at least 5 songs on this album that I treasure, several of which I hadn't heard in either the original or the covered version. Having lost a parent recently, the nature of the tribute also struck a personal chord. Highly recommended."
3,"Some great moments, and some... well....","There are some standout moments on this CD. If you really love Zevon's music, just try to listen to the contributions of Bruce Springsteen or Jill Sobule and not get choked up. Pete Yorn and Lindley/Cooder also provide outstanding takes on ""Splendid Isolation"" and ""Monkey Wash, Donkey Rinse,"" respectively.There are some weak moments, however. I deeply love the Pixies, but their version of ""Ain't That Pretty at All"" felt like it was discussed, rehearsed once or twice, then recorded. And Billy Bob Thornton's take on ""The Wind"" is so excruciatingly bad as to be barely listenable.Zevon fans will enjoy this album, but probably not as much as they would enjoy an actual Warren Zevon album."
1,Good Times All,"The late Warren Zevon was the Grim Reaper's personal poet laureate and court jester throughout his long career. Hard to believe that only one of these songs (as far as I know) was written after he learned of his diagnosis. Son Jordan and longtime producer/cowriter/bassist Jorge Calderon assembled many of Zevon's closest collaborators, sidemen, cronies and admirers for a romp through both the sardonic, gallows-humor pieces he was famous for, but also the vulnerable, emotionally raw ballads he was equally adept at writing and delivering.Zevon liked singing actors for their ability to deliver the emotional content of a song, so he'd be pleased by Sandler's surprisingly muscular"
2,Ridiculous,"Just finished watching the movie and didn't like it.The ending is okay, but in my opinion, the acting is overplayedand artificial. The dialog is annoying. Didn't like the casting.Stan Shaw looks ridiculous in Robert Brickland's role. The explosions and shooting scenes look absurd, and in general, most of it's parts we have seen in a lot of other Hollowood movies. My advice: skip this one. There are better action movies out there."
4,Better Than Average,I liked this book because Phil wasn't trying to give you a 1-2-3 strategy. He gave solid reasons for his thought process and made me think about my game in an entirely different way. I think my over all play has improved since reading this book.I found Phil's writing to be clear and very accessible.
4,Was a good purchase,Was easy to follow and had some good information for the beginner and a little for the intermediate player I would recommend it.
5,Hmm..,"Okay, Vicar of Dibley is in the running of being the greatest British Comedy ever (officially and not just my opinion) but it is very unfair that the complete collection is available in America when we can't get it here in Britain!! I own series 1 on DVD and apart from the ""best of"" DVD, I haven't seen any other series, let alone a complete collection. Unjustice!"
5,The all time funniest brit com,"Every member of this ensemble shines! Dawn French can be straight woman to the group or have you rolling on the floor in her own right. All of the quirky villagers of Dibley make every visit a delight. Our entire family has watched this collection over and over again, and laughed out loud evey time. Well worth having the entire collection, the only thing is that you end up wanting more when it is over."
3,"Dear lord....that was my first ""horror movie""","My sisters dragged me to the theaters long ago to watch that tripe (sans Elvira). It was my first ""horror movie at the theater"" experience, wow is that movie cheesy, definitely a b movie enthusiast type of movie, too bad MST3000 never got their hands on it. Looks like a terrible conversion though, bad sound, poor picture, but I have to remember it's a conversion of a conversion. I got a kick out of it but most probably won't."
3,Interesting but..,"I think this is a super interesting idea for a book and provides a great deal of useful information. Unfortunately, it also contains a large number of errors - especially in the section with the top 5000 words. Some definitions are simply wrong (e.g. cocer is ""to cook"" not ""to sew"" - coser is ""to sew"") But, there are lots of mistakes in this section. So, ¡Ten cuidado!"
3,An average book,I am disappointed because of the contents and methods. Yes it does cover all major systems but the results are given mostly in statistical values rather than physiologic or histology reasons. So I know percentage is high in females for certain illnesses but I do not know why. This book did not tell me.
1,Burned out my stove drip pan,"The only reason I gave this one star is that there's no place for zero stars. I used this canner one evening and it worked great........THEN, I realized it had set so close to my burner that it blocked ventilation. Apparently, there was a huge buildup of heat because it totally RUINED my burner drip pan. I'm hoping the heat buildup didn't effect any of the electrical parts. I do NOT recommend this monstrosity. I'm so angry about my drip pan. They are very expensive to replace."
2,Disappointing. Don't start here!,"I Absolutely loved Cocktails, Word Gets Around, and JEEP...especially JEEP! I was so excited about this band and for this album I actually ordered The Import before even available in the US!Unfortunately, this album never really bears fruit. The songs are all over the map...they range from just noise, to bad 80's power rock (e.g. High as the Ceiling)...to feeble attempts at soul (e.g. Miss You Now). What happened to the great (and incredibly witty) songwriting of the earlier albums!? It's like they said ""let's do something different...for the sake of doing something different...""I was so disappointed in this album...I've yet to check out LSVO!"
4,Mystery of The Batwoman,"Nice movie. As a fan of WB, I am planning to collect all the Superman Animated TV series, Batman Gotham Adventures series, Gotham Girls TV series, Animated Justice League TV series but how come no DVDs are out? ( Except for Justice League and even so, it's slow. Only till 'Paradise Lost' ) I am willing to pay good money for all these shows!"
3,There's a new Bat in town,"Mystery of the Batwoman is the third movie based on Batman: The Animated Series. To briefly surmise, there's a new Bat-person flying about Gotham & she's hitting the crime bosses where it hurts. Now, Batman has to figure out who she is & which side of the law she's on.This film features the same quality animation as seen in The New Batman Adventures. The storyline is good & the voice acting, as always, is top notch. I will say that the mystery was not that difficult to unravel but that didn't take away from my enjoyment of the film. The new Batwoman character is loosely based on the DC Comics heroine. There are also some familiar faces, Robin (Tim Drake), Barbara Gordon (very briefly), the Penguin, & Bane.The special features include some interesting commentaries & character bios. There's also a PC game, which I haven't tried, yet. Overall, I enjoyed this movie & recommend it for Batman fans. I feel that it's a nice addition to my collection."
3,"Good, it could have been better","I enjoyed the overall concept of the movie. However, I would have enjoyed seeing a little bit more background on the three seperate women. I know that they briefly explained each of the women's motivations for helping to create the Batwoman identity. Further, I also thought that if the movie had been longer the story could have been more developed and to have more depth, especially the developing love affair between Bruce Wayne and Kathy DuKane. And, of course, I thought it was clever that each of the three had something special to contribute. One brought the money, one bought the technology and the third was the backbone who introduced the other two and formed the alliance. I thought it was a pity that their secret identities were discovered at the end."
4,Special Features make it all worthwhile,"Used to the first 3 volumes of Batman: The Animated Series, I found the quality lacking compared to them, as Mystery of the Batwoman is in the style of the 4th volume.However, if you're a fan, as I am, you'll find this DVD to be completely worthwhile because of ""Chase Me"", the silent short-film set to music in the special features. It's only a couple minutes long, but it's a beautiful, romantic, action-packed, and humorous film that had me wishing for more."
2,Bruce Wayne is the disguise; Batman is the true identity,"I was somewhat disappointed with this interpretation of Batman. The writers apparently forgot (or never knew) that the true persona in the Batman/BruceWayne duality is the Batman, not Bruce Wayne. The playboy/businessman Bruce Wayne is merely a facade that the Batman projects in everyday life. This is major defining aspect of the Batman/Wayne duality. In the movie, the writers got it all wrong."
2,"wonderful product, bogus price","This is a great address book, but you should know that the price coming out of the factory is $9.95, not the higher prices cited in this listing."
5,superb book!,tons and tons of great insights and knowledge. this can be one of the most powerful weapons in your arsenal - can't recommend enough.
2,"Photo, details and cast list don't match","As of 31 August 2004, this page's cover photo refers to a Spanish-produced film (entitled 'Stranded: Náufragos' in most parts of the world) featuring Vincent Gallo, although the prominently-displayed cast list of the ""editorial review"" refers to another film entirely. Amazon have screwed the page up. I wouldn't bother ordering until I knew which film I'd be getting. Likewise, it doesn't make much sense to keep adding reviews for different unspecified films when we don't know which film is actually the subject of this page."
3,Sort of a mars-soupial,"Yep"" Stranded"" (2001) is a standard formula crash on mars. They make no attempt to slowly reveal the plot. It is an in-your-face yep someone's gotta go who gets to pick and where do they go story. But you knew this before you bought this movie.Even though this film is foreign and some of the acting and reading is stilted we're still fascinated with the interaction of the characters and how they are going to get from point A to point Z. The film does not have to be original or professional; all it has to do is hold our attention and show us their version of the well-known story.The two points that stand out to me are first how Luca Baglioni (Vincent Gallo) wants to spend his dying moments with Jenny Johnson (Maria de Medeiros.) We could've made book on that answer. The second which might've been a little drawn out but I enjoyed it anyway was the reference to Barsoom and Barsoom's characters; I have to expected John Carter pop out from behind the rocks."
1,"Don""t even think of watching it","Well, if you like watching for about an hour people strolling around a deserted surface, talking as they were on a Sunday evening walk and thereby knowingly using up their last oxygen supplies - its your movie. Otherwise, if you want to watch a movie with at least some decent acting, dialogue or any significant plot (and an ending) - go watch a commercial or for that matter anything else. Because this movie is one of the worst I ever saw! Since I wanted at least get the ending I fast forwarded the DVD (for the plot it does not make any difference) and? No ending, really. If you want to watch a (philosophical) SciFi choose ""Solaris"" or the classics, do not waste your time on this."
1,The worst movie...ever,"I have seen some pretty bad movies in my day but this one is by far the worst. It was so bad, I actually watched it in complete disbelief that it could be so bad. The acting seemed like a joke. It was as if the actors were pretending to be bad actors, as if in a spoof. But it wasn't a spoof. It was real and very painful, especially the writing. But I watched it and wondered how someone put any real money into it without laughing himself to death or blowing his brains out from the guilt of sharing this with the rest of the world. What hurt the most was I love Vincent Gallo. But this one was more than disappointing. Oh Vincent, I feel like kissing you on the forehead like Corleon did to Fredo and say, ""You broke my heart."""
1,Beware...Product contains GMO's!!!,"These have expeller pressed canola oil in them. Canola oil is made from genectically modified rapeseed. I believe that is why they don't have the ""USDA Organic"" seal of approval. Doesn't really make sense to use organic corn and then put GM canola oil in them. They are chewy, but if you put them in a 350 degree oven for a few minutes it will make them crispier."
2,Not 3in,"It does not fit 3in PVC pipe, there is a gap that I'm going to have to use buildup tape or something on to make this work. The wye is too small. Don't buy this unless you have something that is adjustable to hook it up to or you will be in the same boat that I am in."
3,Relatively lame,"The world is threatened to be nano-botted. The technologist for the bad guys can only be reached through his teenage daughter. Naturally the CIA has anticipated this situation and call on their deep cover agent trained in two years ago at the age of 13 to infiltrate and recover data vital to our nation's security. All he has to do is cotton up to the daughter. There is just one problem when he sees a beautiful girl his head is full of cotton. There are a few good phony explosion scenes.There is no real target audience. No well formed thoughts or follow through. The actors do not even try to act. The premise is lame.If you really enjoy this genre then you really should watch ""If Looks could Kill"" (1991)."
4,Good!,I thought Agent Cody Banks was a really good movie--I remember walking out the theatre just amazed!! I love Frankie and Hilary...
1,Agent Cody Banks DVD,"I was dissapointed, I bought the movie for my son for Christmas and I didn't bother to save the receipt and when he went to watch it the DVD was cracked in half so we had to throw it away"
2,i've seen better,"advertised as so much never seen before. i should have known why. it was never seen before because film editors had to cut out footage that just wasn't all that interesting. not worth the price. Time-Life loves to repackage, rename & hope to suck you in."
3,For Heterosexuals Only?,"This book might be better titled: 100 Simple Secrets for Great Heterosexual Relationships, as the author only uses he/she and mostly husband/wife examples throughout. If this book is exclusively for heteros only, say so. If not, and the 100 simple secrets can apply to any great love relationship regardless of the gender mix, be more inclusive and use some he/he and she/she examples. It makes the book more relevant and accessible to a wider audience. However, if it in fact is meant only for an exclusive audience of legally marrieds or about-to-be's, then say so so that other groups of lovers in love can save their money and time, and find their simple secrets elsewhere."
4,A decent microphone.,"This mike is very clear and sensitive. The one drawback you might find is that in situations where it is anywhere near your speakers it will cause some major feedback. Something more directional would be better for video chatting, unless you wear earphones. I'm still looking for the right mike, but this one would be excellent in situations where feedback isn't a problem."
1,Like sugar?,"Almost every recipe in this book uses refined sugar. I want a recipe book that utilizes natural but healthy sweeteners like stevia and erythritol. Also, the book is a low budget printing. Everything's in black and white. There are few pictures but the ones that are included are poor quality black and white. I would not buy this book again."
1,misleading text ....,COVERING is a text that PRETENDS to be broader -- but in reality its just another GAY treatise that defends (a) sexual libertine lifestyle. if you are a racial or ethnic minority don't look for any answers here. the Legal context is probably reaching as the preoccupation with psychology suffocates that misleading premise.sycophantic and Uninspired.
3,Great movie,it gives a specific take on the zombie's point of view or in this case a zombie's eye view. although only one character might cordinate with the POV of most zombie movies. the rest did not. not really the first POV. the first ones were Return of the Living Dead series in which the zombies gave a standard POV. most notibly would be RoTLD3 with tv show Nikita's Melinda Clarke.interesting to watch.
3,This is a pretty intense movie,"I watched it on cable, and I was fascinated by it. It is truly funny, and utterly devoid of all the politically correct garbage that every other movie expects us to swallow whole.As a Christian, I am disturbed someone would produce such an item, and then distribute it. It is truly vile, and it appeals to the basest human ideas of sexual gratification, not to mention that it is completely lewd. However, my opinion is tempered by the fact that it (refreshingly) lacks a P.C. agenda, and like I said, it is funny. The acting was average, and not much worse than what passes for ""big-budget"" talent these days.It is not for the weak of heart, or stomach, for that matter. I cannot bring myself to give it 5 stars, but it does deserve something."
2,The Movie was better,"First I'm going to start off by saying that the movie was really great. It's campy humor that you can't help but enjoy. Which is why I was disapointed with this soundtrack. Half the bands are talentless, and I mean they're real bad. But what surprised me was how there are some great bands on here too and most of their songs aren't even that good. Sublime , for example, is one of my favorite bands, but their song on here is just terrible. The only good song on this album is the song ""sacrifice"" by Motorhead. Sacrifice is a really fantastic song and is the only reason I didn't give this album 1 star. Overall don't wouldn't waste your time on the soundtrack, but the movie is a must-see"
2,Tromeo and Juliet,"Unless You Have Nothing Better To Do... You May Watch This Movie. This Movie Is The Most Dreadful Movie I Have Ever Watched. The Director Must Have Been Taking Drugs, Because He Obviously Wasn't Aware To What He was Doing. I Recommend Going To The Dentist Before Watching This movie.... It May Actually Improve The Watching Experience!!!"
2,tromeo and juliet,the movie was a little coffy it took romeo and juliet in put into a funny but much different way
2,Give us some REAL 2pac music!,"I have waited for this album to come out as much as any other dedicated 2pac fan. i was thrilled to finally have it my hands. butwhen i put it in my stereo i realized it was nothin but a pitiful remixed piece of s**t. the music sounds just like another eminem's album with 2pac's name on it. theres no difference between this one and in em's or d12's albums. the worst part is that they made pac say their names, so you can hear him say em, g-unit, banks, buck, trice etc.I gave it 2 stars just because it's 2pac and because of the lyrics."
1,Watch out guys - they're releasing movies from those 50-pack individually!,"Okay, if you include this with 49 other movies for around $20 as I had, you may be incensed by epics such as this. However, if you actually purchase it on its own, you should be asking yourself just WHO are these people that are allowed to sell camera equipment to just about anyone. FORGET about gun laws... get an I.D. check on these people.Oh well, maybe all this explains Obama...By the by, if you DO happen to be of masochistic yearning, this movie actually does have a sequel equally effective in inducing in most viewers dull mouth-dropping experience. I understand one can recreate the effect of absinthe by watching both serially, but might I suggest one not do so without the use of a lobster bib unto which to drool.GO RED SOX !!!"
5,Raves for Dear Frankie,"I was more than satisfied with the quality of this film. The locale, the accent and the characters were very real and believable. Touching story about a mother's protective love for her young son, to maintain an idyllic image of the father who had actually abandoned them. Even the ending was bitter-sweet, yet realistically had to be the way it was.I enjoyed the director's edition, going through the film again, scene by scene, describing her motives and intentions for choosing the actors, locations, angles and lighting. The director herself was so personable, I wanted to know everything she shared. This kind of movie is worth seeing again and again."
4,Pleasantly surprised,"Hadn't heard of this film but wanted something to watch on the plane. Great story, made me laugh, made me cry. I recommend this one!"
4,Gerard Butler & Emily Mortimer: cute couple!,"I really liked this movie. Aside from the gorgeous Gerard Butler, it has Emily Mortimer- an actress who I think is over-looked too often! They have really good chemistry in this movie and you kinda wish that the movie would just keep going. It's a touching story and I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good movie dealing with grown-up emotions in a light-hearted way."
5,Another Gerard Butler movie,One of his best! This independent movie is very well written and a great heart-warming story. A definite must-see.
4,A very touching Scottish film,"I would rate ""Dear Frankie"" as a Robbie Burns version of Hallmark Hall of Fame. A delightful, Scottish 2+ hours of true family entertainment once your ear becomes attuned to the ""burr"" accent.fritz clayton"
3,Cute,"This has a good, solid plot. At times it was a little slow. Don't watch it while you are sleepy."
3,Good but slow,"I did enjoy this, but it was rather slow moving - sometimes difficult to understand as the accents were so thick. But I loved the story itself and liked that it had a ""real"" ending."
5,Wonderful Movie!,"This is our go-to movie to share with friends who aren't into indie movies. It's a wonderful story with amazing acting. The plot moves slower than most blockbuster movies, but it's refreshing in it's simplicity."
3,cussing,"This movie would be a perfectly enjoyable, heartwarming, 4-5 star film, except for the use of Jesus' name as a cuss word several times. I wonder what would happen if movie makers starting using the name of Mohammed, Buddha or any number of Hindu gods as common curse words in their films. Wouldn't you think over 2000 years we humans could have created some new form of cussing without having to insult the dieties of anyone? ""Oh Slug Slime!"" ""Oh Flabby Armpits!"" ""Oh, Snot Snorting Snootful of Snitches!"" Can't cussing be a little more creative and less about hating Jesus? I suppose this kind of thing doesn't matter to most. But, buyers should know."
3,Gerard Butler,"Sweet but slow film, empty ending. Enter Gerard Butler. He appears about 1/2 way into the movie, but makes the movie. You can see where the Phantom was born."
4,A pretty good book.,"This is one of the better books I've read concerning Wicca. This is also the best book I've found concerning solitary practice. Concise and easy to follow, this book instructs the reader on all s/he needs to know to get started when practicing with a coven is impractical and/or unwanted."
5,excellent primer for the new witch,Well written to give the reader a good grounding in wicca. Does not get lost in ritual but instead has the reader explore the subject and develop a style they are comfortable with. A must read for anyone wanting to follow the Pagan path.
5,A fantastic beginning book on Wicca!,"Despite what some ""wiccan traditionalists"" would say, this book is terrific. It gives a great overview of the religion, with lots of hints, tips and tricks for those who want to start up in the religion. Not much in the way of actual spells or rituals, but a great overview!"
4,The Solitary Wiccan's Bible,"This book is what ALL pagans should read!!! Not only does Scott Cunningham make becoming a Wiccan easy, but he does it in a very simple but lively way. I have referred to this book for everything from sabbat info to ideas for symbology for spells. Please, Please, Please read this book from cover to cover and then do it again. This may have been the first book I ever bought on Wicca, and I still have it on the top shelf of my book shelf, right where I can see it! If you have no books or (in my case) you have a library, either way, WICCA by SCOTT CUNNINGHAM is one book you shouldn't be without. *Love & Light*"
2,informative but dry and repetitive,"This was not the first Wiccan book that I had read, and maybe that is why I don't think its so great. When I first skimmed through the book, my opinion was thatI felt as though I was fliping to the same page over and over again. In reality the author had repeted himself a few times. In adition when I finnally got around to reading this book, I found it VERY dull. However, to a person beginning in the craft or to someone who wants to look into the craft, then this book is good to read, if you can stay awake that is."
5,very helpful,I really liked this book. It had a lot of answers to my questions. I also liked this book because I am a Solitary Practitoner.
4,It helps!,"I have just started my interest in this religion. I have read this book and it helped me to understand. It was easy to read and the first book I have read. If you are interested and are just starting out, read this book."
3,Non Fiction,"Wicca : a Guide for the Solitary Practitioner, is what it says, quite practically. It goes into detail of the basics of that particular religion, with rituals, accoutrements, observances, stuff to get and to use, all that sort of thing. It is particularly aimed at those who are by themselves, and have no friends or like minded others around."
1,no hope,"i bought this book to get understanding and to try and figure out why wicca is growing and spreding faster than Christianity in our area. i still do not know why. after reading the book i saw how unorganized and everything the religion is. it offers no hope to those who believe and certainly there is no ""power to be obtained""... i found the book not only uninteresting, but probably the most misleading of any i have read so far."
3,Ho hum... another cookie cutter book,"eh... it wasn't really a bad book, but it wasn't exemplary either. If you have a few beginner's guides to Wicca, this book will be a rehash of everything else. Granted it revolves around those of us who are not involved in a coven, and that is nice, but you can revise and edit rituals to conform to your solitary practice. If you don't have any other beginner's books, and are looking for a place to start, this is a wonderful book for you to start with, because chances are you are on your own and need something geared towards solitary lifestyle. If you have other books, though, and are of a creative spirit, use your imagination and let the Goddess be your guide, and you will have no problem adapting what you already have to suit your solitary needs."
3,I'ts ok.,"If you can I would check it out at the library before buying. I love his to the point easy to read writing style, but he leaves a lot out. He also boasts about wanting to teach the solitary practitioner only to seem to be bullied out of it by ""True"" Wiccan friends of his. The book of shadows seems cleaned up and written just for the book, I don't buy it. A true book of shadows is not as clean cut and is full of trial and error. It's a good reference book and is informative to those who know nothing of Wicca.A book that I do recommend buying of his is The Magical Household by Scott Cunningham and David Harrington. I would also go to Llewllyn's web site. They have a lot of books on Wicca and solitary witches. Two that I have are Sabbats Almanac and Llewllyn's Magical Almanac."
2,fluffy,"This is kind of okay, but a little fluffy for my tastes. It's sort of a Martha Stewart meets Charmed. If you are looking for a ""how-to"", this one is kind of like an appetizer before your steak and potato."
5,Wicca/Soitary Practitioner,"I am new to the Pagan Lifestyle. I have leaned heavily toward it for years but now I am begining to delve and practice w/o restraint. This book has been crucial in the developement of my altar, learning how to honor both God and Godess, learning what tools I need/want in my ceremonies. I have learned so much and I am truly still just beginning! I am excited to learn how to embrace my spiritual path in a simple, straightfoward, enriching, fun way!!"
3,Opens the Door to Wicca: Now You Have to Step Through,"""Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner"" was my first step into Wicca; I have just finished reading it. Since I didn't know much more about the Craft than what has been portrayed in the media, I found the ""Guide"" to be a good introduction to Wicca. Certainly, I'm not in a coven right now, and need to do a lot more reading before I'll be able to say I'm a Wiccan, that I believe in Wicca, or before I'll be performing any rites. While reading the ""Guide"" I felt a connection with the author, as though he understood my confusion about my spiritual path. He didn't give me more information than I could handle.What the ""Guide"" *was* able to provide me with was an introduction to Wicca, the practices, rites, and deities. No one should expect this book to answer all their questions. It will, however, show you the way to *more* questions, etc. Go find more books!"
4,"Good book, but....","I used the guidebook in all 3 countries within one month of its publication, and found it to be accurate for the most part. However, the authors seemed to be under orders to write glowing reports on anything considered mildly worthwhile to visit. Many of these places were not particularly noteworthy, and after awhile we took each raving description with a grain of salt. For some of the most spectacular sites (Davit Gareja and Kazbegi, both in Georgia) the book really should have included maps. The descriptions of both struck me as being second or third hand, as if the authors themselves had not taken any of the trails they described."
3,"Not perfect, but as good as it gets","Writing a guide book for these countries is not an easy job. In this book, information is good and extensive, but don't rely on it as your bible. Maps are not up-to-date, and this might be its biggest weakness; however, you might not find other maps anywhere in the Caucasus which are better, so get this book and use it on the way. You might want to notice that this book is ILLEGAL in Azerbaijan because of pro-Armenia information about Karabakh. At least when crossing by land, the custom control at the border will ask you which books you are bringing in. This is how I lost my book before I even got to use it in the country. But then again, don't blame Lonely Planet, blame the dictatorship."
3,use it as a very general guide,"I only used this book for Georgia, but it got so much wrong---including maps!--that it was almost useless.It was good, however, for a general overview of the history and culture, and what's where. It was also used frequently to try to find the right 'mashtruka' when traveling, since routes are written in Georgian, and I could show the Georgian name to drivers to see if I was in the right van going to the right place.Let's hope that this book is either updated soon, or a competitor decides to publish a guide to this intriguing part of the planet."
5,A beautiful voice and a blessing,I bought this album back in the 80's when Jessie came to visit our church and it will continue to be one of my favorite gospel albums.
5,Who stole my cherry !?,This one is on the Test.You better have seen these a couple of times.Or you are a failure on the surface of our Globe.
5,Porky's review,To get the whole picture of Porky's you have to see all three films. It's kinda like watching Hannibal without first seeing Silence of the Lambs. Porky's lends a light-hearted slant to how sex in 1950's-1960's high school should have been. It played out the sexual fantasies without having to pay the consequences at the end. In a nutshell it was like Mad Magazines approach to Penthouse. Provided parents can check their biased morality at the door I would recommend Porky's to be seen by all teens.
1,NEVER BETTER THEN THE ORIGINAL!!!!!!,This was a terrible film. The only reason this film is even granted one star (dispight the fact that theres nothing less to give) is some of the jokes are funny. I hate the part where the chick fills her bra up with a bunch of crap. And the KKK part was laughable and dull. Porkey's is a fine series only the first and last films are good.
1,Just Plain Bad.......,"I've always been a fan of the Waterboys, and believe that Mike Scott is a great talent, but this album is causing me to re-evaluate my opinion. Waterboys albums are sometimes spotty affairs, but usually have moments of brilliance that transcend the mediocre material. This album,however,has none. In fact,it is just plain terrible. Okay, Mike is getting into this spiritual thing, and that's fine (see ""Bring Em All In"" - wonderful!),but his songs this time around sound embarrassingly amateurish. Let's hope he comes around and finds the fire that he used to bring to his music. This one's a dud."
3,"well written, many irritating typos","fairly readable text, not too dense. only problem is the numerous typos throughout the equations."
4,works well,"We needed a baby gate and this one fit the bill in terms of length and quality. You need to buy the extentions based on how wide of base you have, but most of the different products out there require a base because they dont build them very wide. Our son loves to stand up against the gate and pull at it. So far, he has not been able to pull it over or get through. You get your money's worth and definitely the best one for the price. Others recommended this one and I will agree with them."
4,Doggie gate,I purchased this to block off our hallway so that our dogs don't meander into the back rooms and do their terrorist things.The gate latch is adjustable so that our 4 year old grandson can open it to get access to the bathroom when he remembersto leave in time. It works well with older people who need the facilities as well. It looks good for not being a designergate.
4,Great!,"Read the book in 2 sittings, even though I've never picked up a racquet in my life! Feinstein brings characters to life and provides great insight into the Pro Tennis circuit. Good read for any sports fan."
4,A text on RDS,"The RDS is being heavily used in Europe. The books is mostly an engineering text book. It is also readable by ordinary folks who do not have advanced degrees in Engineering. It also serves as a reference. That is the unique feature of this book. I recommend this book to any one who is involved in RDS.It covers RDS, RDBS, Traffic Information Services, Intelligent Transport Systems and RDS-TMC, Basic and Enhanced Radio Paging, ODA, Differential GPS, etc.A must have reference for RDS engineers. Here is a one fine book which is a source for multitude of information folks."
2,"Two good shorts, godawful quality","The shorts on this tape are great shorts, but the quality is horrible, even according to videotape standards. Plus, there are only two shorts on this tape! Not enough to sustain any stooge fan and there are better releases of these same two films by other companies! I'm giving this one two stars because the two shorts on the tape are quite funny."
3,*sigh* I really looked forward to this,"but sadly, this book was lost on me. I'm a great fan of Lisa Garnder and have followed these characters through her previous outings with them, but this plot just lacked the oomph for me, and I really had a hard time caring for Raine this time out.I finished it, enjoyed it a little, and will still continue to purchase Ms. Garnder's books, I just wasn't thrilled with this one."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE THE AUDIO CD!,"It's not often that I take the time to write a review, but I wanted to save other customers from the inconvenience I experienced. DO NOT PURCHASE THE AUDIO CD!I wish I could speak on the quality of the story Ms. Gardner wrote, but I decided to listen to it instead of read it. (it simply a matter of available time) It starts out really nice. However, when Disk 1 finished, and I reached for Disk 2 I found another copy of Disk 1... no Disk 2.I returned it to the store hoping that only my copy was screwed up, but alas all six copies on the shelf had two copies of Disk 1 and no Disk 2.Ms. Gardner should take this up with her publisher. (or consider a change) How hard is it to count to 2? A bit of Quality Control would have been nice. I would also suggest Amazon take the CD off the shelves as well."
3,Repetitive phrases used in all her books,"I have to agree with Annie M. (Review written 8/09)I'm on the 6th book by Lisa Garnder and although I enjoy her books immensely and stay up untilall hours of the night reading them, her use of repetitive phrases is driving me crazy!!!""He/she fisted their hands by their side"", is one of them. The term ""ergo"" is used so many times inThe Survivor's Club I wanted to scream.I don't want to seem that negative because I do really enjoy her novels and when I begin to read oneI can't put it down until the end but her use of words is really annoying at times.I do really enjoy the series of books with Quincy, Rainie, Kimberely and Mac. I just startedGone and it is slow moving but I have to stick with it because I have the rest of the novels to read :-)"
3,"Good news, bad news","The good news is . . . I finally finished this book. Although I enjoyed it to a degree it wasn't one that keep me awake. It needed a lot more editing. I'll probably read the reviews before I buy another one of her books.The bad news is . . .I've never seen a book repeat the phrase ""the good is . . . the bad news is"" as many times as this one."
5,Great series,What can I say? This is a great series that I love. The price is excellent for an entire season. The comedy is really funny.
2,I am not happy,"Ordered DVD for one price ($21) from a seller of Amazon, received the same DVD, but for $38 from Amazon itself. I used ""buy it with one click"" feature, that's where the screw-up happened. Was not able to cancel it in time (who whould have known I had to?), sent it back, and still do not have information on re-fund from the return service. (Soon be a month). Very reluctunt to use Amazon ever again."
2,Only effective when paired with a related product,"I bought this for my indoor cats and they both promptly freaked when I zipped them in it...it's too confining on its own and seemed like a glorified cage. However, I purchased a pop-up tent of the same material and purpose and attached the two together with twist ties, and they seem to enjoy that much more b/c it's much more spacious. Perhaps I should've bought two of these and that would've worked..however just one unit is not enough for a normal sized cat."
5,NEW OUTDOOR KITTEN!,I got this for my kitten and now she can finally go outdoors!!! She doesn't mind it too much and love the fresh air!
2,Not worth the price.,I hooked this tunnel up to the mesh tent and my cat likes it. BUT I've only had it a few weeks now and the zipper is starting to break which is unbelievable considering that they are charging almost $30 for this little tunnel thing. If I had known it would break that quickly I would not have gotten it.
1,How to despise humanity in one disgusting lesson,"Like most leftists, Brunner despised humanity for being human, and it showed most strongly in his works of this period. ""Stand on Zanzibar"" wasn't worth a first reading, much less a second."
3,"It`s ok, but a litle problem","The Binocular was sent on time and intact ,but a ocular has a lilte deviation than I believe be a litle mistake's factory. I fix the mistake, but its no easy to a people make, because it was a internal prism adjust."
2,darda car track,"I've recently bought the Darda Racing Car Track. After a couple of un/reassemblies, the track's joiners broke and needed to be replaced. This is a toy of poor quality even with its price factored in. I don't recommend this product."
2,"Expensive, and didn't last long","I bought this for my two boys for Christmas this past year. It was great in theory, I liked the different tracks you could build and it was sturdy, BUT, not even 24 hours after opening it, the cars didn't work anymore. I was quite upset by this, as I spent $100 for this set. If the cars would have worked, it would be a great item, but for the money, I would have expected the cars to last longer! They aren't cheap to buy separately either. So, now the tub just sits up on a shelf."
3,USB Data Cable for LG VX6000,The cable was great it fit my phone. Just wish it came with the cd rom.
1,"Dave ""the pope""","Alvison was right, i can't find any driver or program that work with this cable ( if the cable even does work). I emailed the company and haven't received a response (surprise). I wouldn't suggest this cable to anyone. I would either buy at a local cell phone store, or buy from the cell phone company.If anyone does know of a program please let me know.Dave"
4,The best pro-capitalist analysis of the rise of Naziism,This book deserves a 10 for its ideas but is hard reading. Well worthwhile especially for disspelling the myth that fascism is some form of 'Ubercapitalism.' The author's brilliance clearly shines through the difficult writing
1,i am not statisfied,"i did not recieve my purchase. i even contacted the seller who was of no help. i will not partake in buying from here again, and will instruct others to do the same. as you can tel li am very dissatisfied."
4,One of a kind adult animation.,"While the series has worn off a bit for me from when I was firstenthralled by it's sheer dada- esque insanity, the best episodes stilltranscend to inspired levels of bizarre, gross, tweaked humor.When your starting premise is a giant talking shake, fries, and wad ofmeat living in New Jersey, how wrong can you go?It can be hit or miss, but the best episodes ('MC Pee Pants', 'LoveMummy', 'Dumber Dolls' from season 1, 'The Clowning', 'Total Recarl'and 'The Last One' from season 3, 'Video Ouija', 'Dusty Gazongas' and'Hypno Germ' from season 4) rise to a sublime level of hystericalabsurdity, where you're both laughing and shaking your head at theaudacity and bravery of the storytelling.If you like strange, gonzo humor (Monty Python would be my generation'stouchstone) and/or way out-there adult animation, you owe it to yourself togive this a try -- and give it a couple of episodes to let your headget into what the creators are doing."
5,Nuts,"Makes absolutely no sense. I love it. Also, nice to see how they actually started out, things were a little different."
4,Not for the kids,Just so there isn't any mistake....this is a cartoon and has funny looking characters but it is NOT for children. That being said it is one of my favorite series that is currently on tv. I love the humor and the interactions with the characters in the episodes. It is very stupid humor but I enjoy every moment of it.
2,Sigh...,"I really wanted to like this movie, I really did, but in two simple words, IT SUCKED!! I got it on the cyber monday sale this year thinking I would really like it and it was just terrible. You don't feel connected to the characters and the way they meet is just so cheesy to be honest.This movie could have been so much better, but it was just so dull. It had its funny moments (very few), but all in all I would say this movie was forgettable, yes, forgettable."
3,"Not credible, but nice to look at","Neither Justin Timberlake nor his cute co-star show any chemistry here, so it's hard to see why they would become friends with benefits. And I'm pretty sure I won't be spoiling the plot if I give away the fact that, of course, they soon become more than friends, and that's where the complications begin. Typical Hollywood hack work. Timberlake is a gifted comic actor, and I did appreciate his work here. He has good timing, and his body is certainly a thing to behold. You won't laugh, but you'll be mildly entertained."
3,Friends with benefits?,"I liked this movie, i liked Mila in it, but i thought Justin needs to practice more of his acting skills, i just think he could have been better in this movie.It was sweet and funny. I just find it interesting that both Mila Kunis and Natalie Portman were in movies that dealt with the same storyline and they were both in Black Swan together. Maybe the writers in hollywood should start thinking of different stories and not recycle the same thing. (Example: Chasing Liberty and First Daughter)I liked No Strings Attached more than i liked this movie, but i will probably watch this movie again"
2,Unnecessary Language,I was prepared to like this movie but I didn't get 10 minutes in until I turned it off. I'm not a prude but filthy language is never necessary if a movie is good on it's own merit and it instantly reduces the class of the movie and the actors. I would have expected better from Justin & Mila. I was disappointed.
3,um,um why is this dvd so expensive? i don't see whats so special about it. someone please shed some light on this?
3,"Formula, Predictable, but okay.","Two attractive young adults, tired of the dating scene, decide to become friends who also engage in sex. This brings the expected complications, resulting in the predictable ""will they or won't they"" ending. This one is a mixed bag. The leads have good chemistry, and the parents of both bring a bit of depth to the story. However, the formula has certainly been done before, and nothing new is added here. Might be a good movie to take your girlfriend out to see, as it has a few laughs, and may lead to some hanky panky. Just make sure you wait until you get home."
4,Friends With Benefits,"I was on the verge of giving this movie the full 5 stars but try to save all 5 stars for TRULY RARE WONDERFUL movies that you can't live without in your collection! I really, really like Justin Timberlake's and Mila Kunis' acting! This is a fun, feel-good movie that doesn't REALLY have surprises (except, oddly enough, at the VERY beginning) but is such a FUN, engrossing movie, you don't care! People who try to keep emotions out of emotionally-charged situations are probably always, at the very least, ""interesting"" to watch... I recommend this movie!"
4,romantic comedy,"This is a romantic comedy for sure, but it is well deserving of its ""R"" rating. It could be called a sexual comedy as these two are more interested in getting into bed rather than anything else. Mila Kunis is cute and easy to watch, and Justin poses and postures for the camera. Once was enough for me and I will pass this CD on to someone else to watch."
3,It's a cute movie....,"Friends turn to each other for their basic need of sex, no strings attached. Of course you can see it coming a mile away, they are meant for each other. I think they cast the parts perfect, even Justin Timberlake did a good job being the bumbling guy in this movie. Granted the movie want win any awards but its a good way to spend a date night, feel good movie with a lot of laughs."
1,"Boring, incredibly shallow.","Justin is a usual bore and Mila is plain annoying, with plenty of sarcastic, dry banter that's not really funny. The plot is very shallow and contrived, and it feels like the movie was sort of done for the heck of it and nobody really gave too much cr@p. Boring!"
1,I usually love romantic comdies but not this one...,"This felt so predictable and lacked any great acting; it felt like I'd seen a version of this movie many times before. There was nothing overly humorous, new, or unique about this movie so doesn't stand out in terms of romantic comedy titles"
2,eh,the only one who i laughed out loud to on this dvd was George Lopez..The other acts including Paul Rodriguez were kind lame....sorry
2,Actual shipped product is a smaller size than picture,"This is a great product, I've been using it for about seven years. However, the size that ships is the new 14oz re-sealable pouch rather than the 32 oz box that is pictured here. I had searched specifically for the larger box so was disappointed when these arrived. The seller needs to update the image."
2,"I bought this because of a good review in a magazine, but am disappointed.",This is over weight and does not work as will as others I have purchased.
3,"very nice design, but...","Here's my opinion of this watch after several months of ownership:PROS:-the many features-design/bracelet style are very niceCONS:-the big disappointment: i really dislike the red plastic making up the display - it adds a cheap feel to the watch when you look closely enough (looking at the picture here, i took it to be metal w/ paint finishing), which spoils the overall very nice design, especially the bracelet-the lcd display is of poor clarity - you really need to get the right angle to see the display, especially when the glass glares-having the watch on several times, i also noticed the bracelet scratches rather easily (compared to my SS seiko). i was looking for more durable metal."
4,"overall nice product, but...","Here's my opinion of this watch after several months of ownership:PROS:-the many features-design/bracelet style are very niceCONS:-the big disappointment: i really dislike the red plastic making up the display - it adds a cheap feel to the watch when you look closely enough (looking at the picture here, i took it to be metal w/ paint finishing), which spoils the overall very nice design, especially the bracelet-the lcd display is of poor clarity - you really need to get the right angle to see the display, especially when the glass glares-having the watch on several times, i also noticed the bracelet scratches rather easily (compared to my SS seiko). i was looking for more durable metal.I would rate it 3 stars now after several months."
3,Skip It,"I love fantasy stories but this one was disappointing and a lot of work to get through. The main plot was somewhere in there and it had a lot of potential but was hidden behind lots of unnecessary twists, turns and ostensibly ""shocking"" or ""gross"" bits thrown in that didn't really have much to do with anything. Trying just a little too hard and subsequently ""off"" and contrived feeling. I'm sorry, I just wouldn't recommend it unless you've read every other fantasy thing out there. The one thing I DO find interesting about this book is that the only ""helpful"" reviews are the ones praising it."
5,Great book,This is a wonderful book to read for all ages and a good book to read for long car rides.
1,Not good if you live in a windy area,"I bought this for ""1"" party. I knew we were going to have rain and I thought it would be great. I live in Delaware and it was for an April event. So yes, rain did come, along with winds up to 30 miles an hour. The tent came down, we secured it up, once it couldn't pull up it twisted like a pretzel, velcro ripped, bars bent. It was really nice looking when we put it up, just make sure if you are getting it, it's not going to be really windy at ANY point, as it would be fine and then a gust would come and it's over. The next day half of it looked normal, the other half looked like a tornado came through."
4,10x20 Gazebo,"For a hundred bucks perfect for us. We use tent maybe twice a summer. Saw complaints that it was difficult to put up,not true for us. Hubby had it together and up by him self in 20 minutes! Only complaint was material could be thicker, but if like us you use once or twice a year fine. I do recommend buying the leg weights sold separately."
1,Stay away from this tent.,Do not waste your money purchasing this tent. Is is cheap and not worth the money spent. It was put up and 15 minutes later it was down on the ground all bent up. I threw it in the trash.
4,handy handbook,"A small (7.25"" x 5"") practical handbook for health personnel or international health workers in the tropics. Suitable as an introductory text for which can be supplemented by further reading for more indepth infomation of specific topics. It covers the major child health issues for the tropics. The 27 chapters cover topics such asgrowth and development, young child feeding, infections, immunization, health policy, clinics, etc. Emphasis is placed on preventive care. (This review is the the 5th edition, 1985)."
1,Surprised,What shocked me the most was the level of incompetence these supposedly trained soldiers displayed as well as the absurd level of ignorance and racism shown.
3,U wont c this on CNN,"It's so very sad that while America has two major wars raging you are hard pressed to find ANY major media coverage. There was better coverage of Vietnam! So, if you want to see what your government has been working so hard at making sure you don't see, watch this. Watch the extras if you want to see more soldiers' stories. In a way, the extras are better than the feature."
1,The worst,"Um, im not sure how to say it. So I will keep it simpleEverything was bad.The story was bad, the acting was bad, the directing was bad.NOTHING was good in this movie. It starts of with a cop finding her, and than taking her home. His wife wants her out, but he keeps her.Then she has sex with him, really badly done, eats a Asian girl and a cat, more sex, and eats a boy. Than he trys to kill her but gets shot.It was the worst movie I ever saw, and I saw Beyond The Walls Of Sleep. Id rather watch that. Hell, id even see a Uwe Boll movie before I see this again."
1,disappointing ...,"I rented this poor rehearsal from Redbox for 1.00. This movie does not even qualify to be in the forgotten budget dollar films bin at Dollar General Store. I could only put up with about 10 mins of ""it"" ... I would not recommend this splice of crap film to anyone. I would probably say it cost about 200 pesos to slap it together. In my most accurate conclusion, I give it 2 broke thumbs and 10 stinky toes way down, grade -F, flunk, flunk, stunk, The best part of this poop film was when I got up, came to somewhat of a reality check and flinged it out of the dvd player."
4,"SCOUTS HONOR is a dumb, crazy good time!","Grab your bong (beer or other), kick back and check out this insane comedy movie!! If you're looking for something like THE KINGS SPEECH or SOCIAL NETWORK, you're looking in the wrong place. However, if you want a stupid comedy for some laughs and a little diversion from the mundane, SCOUTS HONOR: BADGE TO THE BONE is the right kind of movie for you! A bunch of crazy characters (aren't they all a little old for summer camp??) pepper this story about sibling rivalry as 3 brothers fight over control of the nuttiest Tiger Scout Camp in America. Chris Kattan shows off his in-your-face comedy chops, made famous on Saturday Night Live, and Fred Willard adds some of the deadpan, hilarious character work that made him the favorite of movies like BEST IN SHOW and WAITING FOR GUFFMAN. Likely best viewed under some kind of intoxication... :) Enjoy!"
3,Criminals Beware!,"Of the ineffectiveness that is the police force. If they studied from this book...it still wouldn't help. Read this cover to cover, told me very little I didn't already know. For a college text it wasn't bad, though outdated."
5,love the price,"My dad loved his gift that I bought him for fathers dad, it got to him very quick. The only thing that disappointed me was that amazon left the invoice in the package which had the price of the product, I had asked not to put the invoice in the box. Also I had written a card to be sent along with it and it was not in the box. I was very disappointed about that. Other than that the product is great quality and a very great price."
5,The perfect gift for your PPG this Christmas!,I just saw this new Powerpuff Girls addition to our Christmas culture and it is just super! I highly recommend it to your own little PPG. The girls are off on a new adventure to save the children in Townsville from having one terrble Christmas all thanks to their rival and wanna be PPG Princess Morbucks. The cast is just great with lots of new banter between the PPG and the entire town has never looked so pretty as in the snow of winter. All of the main characters are back with lots of surprises and a special treat for anyone who loves Bubbles. A real treat and should definately be included as a stocking stuffer with the PPG movie of last year. I highly recommend this as a collector and as a fan. Bravo!! The day has been saved!! and so has Christmas!!!
1,Hard case too thick,"Case was too thick so was almost impossible to work controls.Clip slides up and down too easy, would not use when running.Screen Protector was only plus as it was easy to install."
2,great until they raised the price almost 10$ in 1 month,"The cookies themselves are ""ok"". Not spectacular, but...ok. They were also under 15$ when I purchased them LESS THAN A MONTH AGO! Now they are almost 25$ for THE SAME AMOUNT! I would not suggest purchasing these price gouged products. Make your own, better tasting and less expensive cookies."
4,encyclopediac and brutal,"This book is like an encyclopia -- very thorough, but also somewhat inaccessable to those who don't already know the language and terms it uses. For a one volume summary of basic algebra, this book probably has the widest degree of coverage."
3,Terrible first algebra book,"After having it used as my undergraduate algebra text, I hated algebra for about 15 years. Absolutely NO motivation or ""genetic"" understanding of the material. If you DO know the subject already, the book has many of the slickest proofs, so a good book for the professional, terrible book for instruction. Oh, another thing: if you want to know how to actually go about computing some algebraic object (eg, Jordan canonical form, Smith normal form, etc), do NOT try to find the answer in this book."
5,What can you say about Shirley Temple?,I grew up watching these Shirley Temple movies. It was refreshing to see simple...well acted movies without a political agenda. You don't have to watch nudity or hear swearing.
2,bad!!!!!not like others,they are not colorized like the previous releases in this collection. we only have black & white. very upsetting!!!!!!!don't waste your money unless you just can't live without shirley temple.
5,Young People starring Shirley Temple,"I think this is a wonderful piece of work by Shirley Temple. Yes, in her early films, she has proven to be a pleasure to watch, but I also believe that in her later films, they are extraordinary, as well, and showcased her abilities to embrace different rolls and carry her acting abilities forward. I believe that she has been underrated as an actress and that all of her films should be made available to the public. Although there are many good films out there, I do believe that classics such as these have been lost,as a whole, and we need more quality films like these."
1,No Color - No Buy,"I've bought every Shirley Collection Vol. 1-5 so far up until this one. I will NOT buy this current Vol. 6 because it's NOT COLORIZED!!! I would only buy this if it were in it's beautiful color version the way the previous releases were. All of the previous color versions have looked great and I was looking forward to completing my COLOR Shirley collection, but Fox has pulled the color rug from under me, releasing now only the b/w drab dull and extremely dated looking Shirleys. Without the color Shirley Fox is going to be without my green."
1,Erin Baker's Breakfast Cookie,"This is one of the most tasteless things I have ever tasted. If I could have sent them back, I would have. CAS"
2,The flavor doesn't taste like peanut butter,I got these because I have tried the other vegan flavor that I like. These don't taste like peanut butter at all to me. I can taste a prune flavor. Looking at the ingredients prune puree is listed before the peanut butter. This explains the flavor issue I have with them. I won't purchase them again.
5,My Favorite,"These are delicious and filling! I like that they're vegan! They're a filling breakfast for on the run days! The big thing about these breakfast cookies is that they need to be refrigerated. We didn't do that once and several cookies grew mold in just a couple days of room temperature. This is also a problem because ups sometimes leaves them on our front steps rather than our porch and they have gone unnoticed for a couple days a few times that we've ordered them. Erin Baker's customer service is really friendly and helpful, and the cookies actually taste better cold than room temperature!!"
5,This is the book you want,"This is the book many others attempt to duplicate but simply cannot. In addition to the cool little features like elastic band (keeps book closed when stuffed full of other found items & papers), the pocket in the back and the durable cover this is a very well made book. As a student of book making, this is a classic piece. Most books nowadays are a form of ""perfect binding"" where the pages are just glued on the spine. Needless to say this is as non-archival and non-durable as it gets. Moleskine's are done they classic way: pages folded and sewn together in signatures then sewn to the binding. They will last forever, which is why we still have sketchbooks around from the likes of Van Gogh, etc.An overall great choice, I recommend it constantly."
1,CD Walkman Doesn't Fit!!,Shame on Amazon for recommending this product to be purchased with the CD Walkman - the CD player doesn't fit! I should have read the reviews before adding it to the order. It's not meant for the CD Walkman purchased - but who knew! Amazon should figure that out before they recommend it.
1,Did Not Purchase,"The first indication that something was wrong with this product was the price. It was ""marked down"" from $211.99 to $3.50. Who in the right mind would believe that this Walkman CD carrying case would ""orginally"" cost $211.99? Guess ""soneone"" thinks there are a lot of gullible people in the world. After reading the reviews, I decided the case is probably selling for $3.50 because it is useless and Sony is trying to dump the product to get rid of it. This case looks a lot like the one I own which is worn out but mine has a flap opening not a zipper. I made my decision NOT to purchase this item after reading the reviews. I just bought a Sony CD Walkman D-NF340 MP3 player and wanted a new case for it. Guess I will keep shopping. One would assume Sony Walkman CD players are the same size, so why wouldn't Sony make a belted pouch that FIT their CD players?"
4,Carry-case,Please consult your own records <---> I have already reviewed this item...within the past 8 days.
1,Not correct size,"This carrying case was sold with the Sony D-NS505 S2 Sports ATRAC Walkman Portable CD Player. The case does NOT fit the CD player. We enjoy the player, but I am disappointed that the carrying case did not fit the player, especially since they were sold together."
2,Downward Spiral...,"This album is so disappointing. Sleater-Kinney has written some amazing music, but this is album is extremely generic. Nothing really clicks. It doesn't seem as though any of their considerable talents are being put to use. The energy is there, and there are moments where it seems like a good song is going to emerge, but then it just falls flat. I tolerated ""All Hands on the Bad One,"" but I think this is the last Sleater-Kinney album for me."
2,What does it all mean?,"What does Sleater-Kinney mean? I'm pretty sure it means ""atonal screaming."" If the party has gone just a bit too long, use this CD to clear the room. Other than that, it makes a good coaster."
1,All Songs Considered? Hardly !,"I have listened to NPR for 11 years and love the ""buttons"" that are played between news segments on ATC, Morning Edition, as well as many other programs. I've been waiting for a good list of the songs or an album like this for years. There is, however, one slight problem with this album. Only two of songs on the CD sound vaguely familar to me, a long-time listener. And they are not even very good. This collection, in my opinion, is by no means the better material or that which you would hear most often on NPR. It's not bad. But it sounds like the second or third rate stuff compared to what is played on a daily or weekly basis. My guess is that NPR could not obtain licensing agreements for the better stuff. Save your money.... Each program's music is listed in detail. Now there is some really good music. I've noticed that ATC and Morning Addition have borrowed some of their buttons recently. They could have done better. Sorry."
2,Not User Friendly,"The stories are great(as usual), but the DVD is not very user friendly. You have to access different menus to view the bonus episodes."
1,Horrible Camera.,"Bought the camera for (...)cause it came with a free printer. Glad it came with a printer, because this camera is a piece of junk. I have never had shutter lag this horrible; you click the shutter button and you have to wait well more than 10 seconds before the thing actually takes the picture. The screen is jerky too, reminds me of watching video on a 24.4 baud modem. Horrible piece of equipment. DO NOT BUY THIS. Not even for a junky camera. It is not worth more than $10! Plus, at $10, I still wouldn't buy it. I purchased this for my 3 year old, and I'm even dissapointed for her how crapy it is."
4,Needs more Brak,"Virtually Brakless. Brak fans will want to wait for future volumes.Still hilarious, though."
4,Page Turner,"I bought this book based on a brief review Stephen King wrote in an issue of Entertainment magazine. If you like Stephen King you'll appreciate this story. It's strikingly similar to the book ""The Long Walk"" that King wrote under the psuedonym Richard Bachman. Some have compared it to ""Lord of the Flies"". It's a fairly quick read that keeps your interest. I'd recommend it if you're in the mood for reading something fun but not too challenging."
4,The best book ever written!,"I have read so many books, but this has to be my favourite. The author almost makes you feel sorry for the deaths of the students, and you almost feel as though you are there. If you were on an island, forced to kill maybe a twin brother or sister (Not that anyone had to) or maybe a girlfriend, your best friend, someone like that, what would you do? You can bet your life someone in the book did it. Whether you'd kill your friends (Kazou), hide out (Megumi), or try to stop the violence (The lighthouse girls) someone did it. There may have been a few problems with translation, but you can't help liking it. Everything is described in detail, and some would feel as if the character is a friend. You can cry, you can laugh, or you can wish you'd never payed the $10.85 + p&h, but you need to read this book!"
5,YUUUUUUMMY!,"This stuff is hard to find in the ""real world,"" so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon, and with free shipping, too! It is delicious!"
5,"Delicious, just like Dunkin Donuts","This is the best testing Vanilla chai latte on the market. I used to love Dunkin Donuts Vanilla chai and stopped drinking it for a long time, because it cost so much to buy a cup everyday and I've tried to find one that was more convenient, where I could make it from home and have a more reasonable price per cup and this is it. Thank you Amazon for carrying this and at the stellar price you do!"
1,lame,"i was hoping to get an in depth lecture. unfortunately, this video gives a shallow and broad overview and presents no solutions. wish there were 0 stars. save your $."
1,How not to make a creationist video.,"With 1977 cinematography, and 1987 computer graphics, this item was thrown together by 1997. It somehow managed to win a Catholic award in Poland for that same year, but for the rest of the world, it didn't pass the smell test. This video blatantly confuses cross-bed strata with ordinary strata, fails to mention the importance of radio-isotopes in reference to uranium/lead radiometric dating, and outright lies about the samples taken by the Glomar Challenger. Despite all this, and my low star rating, I'm recommending everyone buy this video. It's good for a laugh or two, and is a lesson to all about just how far creationist propaganda will go."
