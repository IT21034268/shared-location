4,Confident and worldly.,"Shannon McNally's music seduces you into listening. She is in no hurry to impress, and doesn't need to be: Jukebox Sparrows is rich and deep, moody and engrossing.It's hard to categorize the music on this album. While clearly country-influenced, it has a sparkly pop sensibility and grooves worthy of great rock songs. The arrangements are stunning, with subtly quirky touches (""Bitter Blue"" being the best example), and McNally's voice is wonderfully commanding. She doesn't rely on fireworks, but she enounces each syllable with seasoned confidence. ""Down and Dirty"" starts the album out in an entrancing mid-tempo; ""Colorado"" is hauntingly beautiful, drowning in spacey guitars and a lonely lead vocal; and ""Bolder Than Paradise"" is weirdly playful, all strange lap steels and percussion, right down to starting out with a drawling band count.McNally obviously has a knack for staying off the beaten path. These ""Jukebox Sparrows"" definitely warrant your attention."
1,wrong item,I ordered oval glue sticks and they sent me round ones which don't fit my glue gun. I am disappointed and want to know how I send these back to you and get oval glue sticks.
4,Nice home use glue gun,"Easiest glue gun I have ever used , perfect for my casual once in-a-while use !I would purchase again without a second thought ."
1,Totally quit working!,"This was a gift for a friend, who had trouble with the phone from the beginning; the phone has now (after only a couple of months) quit working altogether. I've always had good Panasonic products, but this one was a dud!"
1,No Belt Clip Included - You Have to Order It!!!,"I bought this phone today because I have an older model that I just love.What a surprise to discover that it doesn't come with a belt clip--you have to order it and pay for it! (I verified this by calling Panasonic.)This is just insane. It's a silly piece of plastic. Why would a phone that's headset compatible not come with a belt clip? That's the whole point of ""hands free""!I'm taking the phone back tomorrow. Sad.I'm so disappointed in Panasonic. Maybe they make another model that comes with a belt clip, but I'm not optimistic."
1,Mine stopped working too....,"I bought this in August, and in October I couldn't hear the calling party - they heard me just fine. Then it stopped working altoghther. Very disappointing for a Panasonic."
1,Huge Disappointment,"I have always liked Panasonic products. Within a month of purchasing this one, however, I knew I'd made a mistake. The sound quality is terrible, often fading in and out. Interference is a constant problem, which is really regretful for a digital phone. Battery life is short and it doesn't always charge properly. To add insult to injury, within 2 weeks the display stopped working altogether. Just a blank screen. We are a normal family with normal phone use, and this phone couldn't even hold up to that."
2,Microphone stopped working after 1 year in use,Very dissappointed with this unit. We liked it features and the sound quality. However we have been using it for just over the year and the microphone just stopped working. I would have expected a higher quality product from Panasonic!
5,Grace ubove all,Grace is one of the best albums ever made. It is essential in every album collection. It is a pity the man died.
4,Good Account of Apollo 13,"Bill Mumy does a credible job narrating this documentary of Apollo 13. Lots of interviews with NASA people and the astronauts, plus a lot of good original footage. Good to add to your Apollo 13 collection and the price is right. Haven't seen it on DVD yet."
1,GARBAGE!,Uninspired and ostentatious drivel that seems more suitable to Spike TV fans than true diehards of the genre. DRECK! FEH!
2,A good effort with some misleading info..,"Why is an MD writing on learning disorders? Some inaccuracies Inoticed..autism is a neurological disorder, not a developmental disorder. And I question the statement ""shyness and autism are sometimes confused"". He never discusses motor delays as a reason for poor handwriting. Some useful information here, but much inaccurate information."
2,I was a little disappointed.,"I have read all of Brian's books, I have listened to most of his tapes, and attended several of his seminars here in Seattle. I got less out of this book than I have his other material. This book might be better for those who are getting their first look at Brian's message. Overall, I think Brian is the greatest self-helper in the game. I credit Brian for so many of my accomplishments and personal growth, however at $30.00 for the hardback, this book came up short for me."
2,"almost there, but not quite","I'm a sucker for Scottish/Irish movies, but it's too bad the guy they picked to be the grandfather here is 100% American, with a phoney accent that comes and goes. Don't get me wrong - he's a nice guy and everything - but I think it was a mistake to pick him and not a native actor. The story is essentially a variation on the Old Yeller theme. Oops, did I give the ending away?"
2,Could have been better,I did not care for how it was written. It did not hold my interest at all. I would have liked to read more about how he servived in jail. The interview I had seen on T.V. was more interesting.
4,Game Benefits Kids As Well As Seniors,"I live in a Senior Complex, and have introduced this game to several residents as well as our manager (who isn't a senior) and everyone loves it. It's great stimulation for our 'brain cells' and keeps us on our toes even though we sit playing the game. I would recommend Rummikub for all ages. This purchase is for our manager, who will teach and play with her husband and adult daughter.Lila (age 76)"
5,Great family game,"This is a tile game, but it's similar to rummy type card games. It offers a ton of variation and is a really fun party or family game.It's pretty simple to learn, but there is a ton of strategy and logic involved too.It's a good child/adult game and while there is some luck of the draw, a lot of the tiles are shared and that usually gives everyone a chance to out think the other guy.I highly recommend this one."
2,"Long, Boring","This was so long and drawn out. It took over 3 hours for this film to lay out what any crime show could have done on TV in an hour, including all the commercials. There were so many scenes that just went ON and ON - that's what they make DVDs for: to cut out long useless scenes to add to the ""deleted scenes"" special edition, so people who actually liked the movie can watch more of it, haha. acting wasn't even very good and not always very believable. just CHEESY. save yourselves 3 hours of your life.also, i have no idea why one reviewer thought there was no sex. though it really wasn't as violent as most movies, still it's no family movie."
2,AMWAY SELLING thru Amway typical motivational style.,"As a person out of Amway circle, I feel that there's not much of the content there. Even though the author has some credibility, but how much can we believe in what he said because he's into the Amway business himself? The first two-thirds of the book are almost nothing except selling and selling and selling Amway business. Only 2-3 interesting viewpoints worth some thoughts from this book. Other than that the content might only work or worth the time only for those in Amway business."
4,Oh sigh.,"I thought this would be an overly pedantic study of the album, but it is really more of an overview of ALL of Joy Division's recordings with little focus on ""Unknown pleasures"" itself. This wasn't unwelcome to me as someone who always gets confused as to the chronology of Joy Division recordings. Moreover, the book contains a decent (but not overwhelming) amount of biographical anecdotes which, ultimately, makes this a very readable and enjoyable book."
4,"Really useful, almost worth the ridiculous price","I got this book as a gift and was shocked when I found out the cost as it is suprisingly thin and looks like it should cost less than half as much, but it really is a brilliant book and I can find no other way to critisise it. The examples are superb and the definitions for every command are concise and accurate. A good idea if you can afford it!"
5,I love the song it really touches my heart!!!,"You all did a good job on the ""Children of the Dust"" it is a heart touching song!! Lisa Giompoletti Bruce,MS"
2,Waste of Time,"This has got to be one the worst screenplays/plots I have ever seen. It's disjointed and makes no sense a lot of the time.Elizabeth Hurley shows almost no emotion here, she's mostly intent on smoking cigarettes and doing drugs. In fact, almost everyone in the film smokes like a chimney. About every scene Hurley is in starts with her lighting up - I have no idea why the director finds these constant closeups of her chain smoking so fascinating.C. Thomas Howell tries hard to breathe some life in the film, but is saddled with a goofy, disheveled biker wardrobe, wearing the same outfit most of the time. I was hoping he would shower and change his clothes. The love story between the two is not believable because of Hurley's acting, which seems to be phoned in. Jeremy Brett is wasted here, Joss Ackland is a great actor, but this film is beneath him.The only reason someone might want to see this is for the topless scenes of Hurley."
4,"Not perfect, but pretty good.","This is a word-for-word repeat of my review of ""The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"" collection because I found the quality of these two collections to be identical.Despite complaints from some other reviewers, I find the video quality of this collection to be acceptable. It's not great, but the original looks to have deteriorated before transfer, given the amount of film noise evident. Sound is fair, but it's a 1980's production. I have yet to run into any unintelligible dialogue. If you enjoyed the series, the few defects in the collection will do nothing to spoil the experience."
4,"Great Series, But DVD Found Wanting","Jeremy Brett and Edward Hardwick come together as Holmes & Watson in some of the greatest adaptations of these great stories ever. Both actors are at the top of their game. My only criticism is that unlike some of the more recent releases, this DVD edition appears to have been taken straight from the video. The screen is very dark and grainy, making it look like it was taped off the TV rather than remastered for digital.I've seen some of the more recent DVD releases including the ""Casebook"" and the crisp images are far better than these. That said, the price on the ""Return"" DVD is low and who knows how long it will take them to come out with a new remastered edition.I would also hope for more commentary on the next edition. Extras including Vincent Price's excellent introductions for the ""Mystery"" series would be great. Holmes without Price isn't quite the same."
5,For any who know Jeremy Brett is THE Sherlock Holmes,"As I had seen the shows when originally broadcast on American public television, I knew exactly what I was to be getting when buying this season of the Grenada Holmes series starring the wonderful Jeremy Brett and Edward Hardwicke (a pair who must be up in Heaven having a grand time reminiscing together now, I know it). The bonus was that each episode would be clear enough to watch without squinting through the static, wonderful to listen to without that same static, and whole without interruptions!For any fan of Jeremy Brett this is a must, as it contains several of the best shows of the series, including ""The Empty House"", ""The Second Stain"", ""The Six Napoleons"", ""The Priory School"", ""Silver Blaze"", and ""The Musgrave Ritual"". This is especially for those like me who see Mister Brett's portrayal as the quintessential Holmes. I plan on buying the other three seasons of the show plus the five-movie set to complete my collection as soon as possible!"
5,Wonderful adaptaion of Sherlock Holmes,"This latest release of the popular Granada series via MPI home video is even better than the last two collections in that there is now a commentary track from the original director. Picture and sound are fine, free of the warbling issue found in some of the earlier episodes. Contrary to a previous review, the episodes ARE subtitled, however they are done rather poorly, with misspellings and poor timing to the actual dialogue. Nevetheless, if you are a fan of this series, or just like quality television, Jeremy Brett's portrayal of Holmes is a joy to watch."
1,Boring,"I think I'll mention its good points first. The animation and art in this series is good. The Female lead is a pretty lady. That is the only thing that made keep watching it. There is plenty of action, but it wasn't too intense because I didn't care if the main character died and the series ended. All the bad guys are chumps. They are probably related since all of their noses looked like wieners hanging on the middle of their faces. They also have really stupid sounding voices. The series is kinda like James Bond, if he were a cyborg chick with mentally handicapped enemies. I found it impossible to care about this series at all. Out of the many anime series I own, this is the worst. I agree with the review that said, ""at least it was cheap"". If you pay money for this you will probably be very annoyed."
4,scorned woman,"It's my favorite. It's really that simple. This sauce is hot and full of flavor. There are hotter sauces to be sure, but this is the best combo of heat and flavor I've ever had and I've probably had 20 or so. Enjoy!"
5,A Cajun Feast for the Ears!!!!!,"What an exciting CD!!!! It's almost like being at Eddy's concert!!!! He does an OUTSTANDING job on every cut, and demonstrates his unsurpassed vocal ability as well as the full spectrum of the various musical styles that he blends into his repertoire. Particularly striking are his renditions of ""I'm Gonna Get You,"" with his French ad-libs and John Trahan's accordion, and ""We Robbed Trains,"" which shows his outlaw side. Listen to this CD, and you will understand why Eddy is THE most exciting performer in the universe!!!! I can't get enough of it!!!!"
5,Powerful Songs with a Powerful Message,"I love this tape & also just ordered ""The Gift"". My favorite songs on this one are ""I Can Mend Your Fences"" and ""When I Close My Eyes"". As a soloist at my home church & other churches, I immediately got these songs on soundtrack as well & everyone loved them. The songs have a powerful, spiritual message & they are songs that stick in peoples mind...Jessica has a new fan in me & I hope to hear lots from her in the future."
5,Ah! My Goddess: Quick Reivew,"Making a case for the power of faith and courage, Ah! My Goddess reaches out its welcoming hand to anyone who's ever been through the hard-ships of love and relationships. Although stumbling every now and then, a nutty, yet easily delightable troupe brings the show some of its most memorable moments. If nothing else, even for just for a brief moment, Ah! My Goddess will put a smile on your face, and peace in your heart."
3,Hey Dee Dee,"the cd is a lot of ramones covers, I'm some diappointed with Dee Dee because he showed little creativity. I think maybe he wanted to show he could sung some more tracks on the Ramones era...and that's right, not bad vocals...but the girl (on ""sheena is a punk rocker"") sings awful. doesn't matter, anyway I enjoy to hear ""blitzkrieg bop"" and all others, even ""sheena...."". there are a couple of Dee Dee's own songs and rockin' too.for ramones fans as document."
3,A typical Franco Sleazefest.,"Eugenie de Sade is a well acted sleazefest that entertains but is ultimately rather forgettable. If you're looking for T&A or are a Franco fan then this one should be right up you're alley, otherwise just move along."
4,Warfare in hte Book of Mormon,"Amazing book, value just keeps increasing. Well written on many areas of interest. Well researched and documented."
3,"DIFFERENT, BUT WATCHABLE","THIS MOVIE WAS ALRIGHT. IT IS LOW BUDGET, BUT ITS WATCHABLE. ITS ABOUT A COUPLE WHO'S LOOKING TO SPICE UP THERE LOVE LIFE AND THEY FIND THAT MURDER IS A HOBBIE THAT TURN BOTH OF THEM ON. BUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN ONE PERSON DECIDED TO STOP THE KILLING? CAN THERE RELATION SURVIVE WITHOUT MURDER? U HAVE TO WATCH AND SEE."
4,Biblical Assertions are based on misinterpretations.,"I prefer: A History of Israel, Walter C. Kaiser; Kingdom of Priests, Eugene H. Merrill, and The Old Testament Speaks, Samuel J. Schultz. All are faithful to the archaeological record and use objective readings of scripture. When a position can not be adequately supported, they say so.John Bright in contrast, seems overly concerned with keeping accord with those holding views from the ongoing Wellhasen tradition. That is O.K. if you support your position. However, when Bright denies the accuracy of the scriptural record, he does it by taking the passage totally out of context. Such novel interpretations must be backed with either linguistical, historical, or other evidence. Bright provides neither for his assertion that Gen. 34 is a later event backwardly ascribed to the 16th century. He calls Israel's blessing a rewriting of an ejection of the tribes of Simeon and Levi from the Shechem area after prior conquest. (ch. 49:5-7)"
1,Don't waste your money.,Thought this would be much better than it was. A plastic cup has better durability. Kids played it ONE time and then it was broken. Make your own.
1,"Fancy, attractive case will SCRATCH your ipod","Piel Frama has a reputation for high end leather goods, so I purchased their case designed specifically for the video Ipod. The case is attractively designed, but imagine my disappointment when the hard stitching on the inside of the case left serious scratches all over the face of my ipod...what's the point of the case? For such an expensive case, you'd hope for materials designed not to be abrasive to the ipod screen.I wrote to ask Piel Frama for an explanation/suggestion and have received no response from customer service for over 3 months.I suggest looking elsewhere for a safer case for your ipod!"
4,Good for what it is,"The photos could be a bit sharper, but if you're like me and don't have ready access to a live model it makes a decent resource for figure drawing practice. Most of the ""pose file"" books I've seen have flaws in one way or another (pictures are too small, contrast isn't very good, etc.), but this is one of the better ones, relatively speaking. The photos are at least large enough to see, with most either full or half page."
4,Fantastic inspiration and reference!,"This book has an extraordinary array of poses, in motion and not! The models are all different body types, though all relatively young and fit. Quite a few more women than men.In response to the other reviews: it's true that this is not the right book to get if you want in-depth, clear musculature. It's more just to look at then to walk you through or teach anything. But the photos are good quality and it's a great reference for a more impressionistic or natural/flowing approach to anatomy, which is just as important for an artist as technical detail!It takes all types of books for a complete breakfast.. er, complete anatomy reference library, and this is definitely one of my keystones! A great reference, great substitute for life drawing, (as good as possible, since nothing really tops life drawing) and an amazing inspiration to flip through!"
5,Way better than OEM,"Bought this set for my 2004 Jeep TJ Rubicon when one of the OEM nuts fell apart taking it off. They use a standard iron lugnut with what appears to be a tinplated cover, which separated. The Gorilla nuts are solid, very well chromed. It's great to have a locking lugnut on each stud too - and being they're all the same, they look much better than 4 OEM nuts and one locknut. Shipping was amazing too. I live in Canada and these aren't available on amazon.ca so I ordered them from amazon.com. I had them at my door in 8 days! Can't beat that. Have bought two other sets too. One for my other vehicle and one as a gift to my son for his. A great product in my opinion."
4,quick delivery...item as expected,We ordered and received this item within a few days. It was very quick service and item replaced burners for Kenmore grill 16225 perfectly. Have only used once so far so I can't attest for anything long term (reason for only 4 stars and not 5) but don't suspect any issues.
5,Wishes,This is an excellent CD. It is great for playing in the background while entertaining for the holidays. It is also very relaxing when you want to unwind from a busy day.
5,Dark Shadows #7,"purchase went very well, nice addition to my collection of Dark Shadows series - no problems at all and will use again"
4,Great Characters,"I never write reviews for books. I figure, who needs a strangers' opinion on a personal thing like a book. This book however made me laugh out loud and that never happens. The characters were real and I cared about what happened with them. The story line was still formulaic like most lesbian romances.... girl meets girl, obstacles and the past get in the way, and they find their way back to each other. However, the story around the 2 women was funny and real and down to earth. If you read this story and don't find someone in the book that reminds you of someone you know it would be a shock. The dialogue was very well written and believable. I would recommend it highly for a light read with sweet romance and a lot of laughs."
2,video quality leaves a lot to be desired,"I'm going to give this two stars instead of one because Eric Johnson is an incredible guitar player and I'd even watch an Eric Johnson concert in black & white.The camera work is pathetic. Also this was intended as a home video release, so why was it shot in 2:35:1? Concerts are shot in 1:85 or 1:78. Not only does the camera work suck but the quality also sucks. I realize that this DVD probably wasn't given the same buget as say The Foo Fighters BluRay or The Police Certified but the Jeff Beck DVD that just came out blows this away.I've seen Eric Johnson probably a half dozen times in concert and he's never played for less than 2 hours. So why is this DVD only about an hour of music?The standards have gone way up for what a concert DVD or concert BluRay should look like and this falls way short of expectations."
5,Purchased as a gift,"This was purchased as a gift, one of thier fave movies as a child and was nice to be able to find it and replace it for her."
1,Don't buy this book,"This book is riddled with typographical, grammatical, and factual errors. It also manages to contradict itself in several places.Don't buy this book."
4,Great book even for adults,"Out of all the diet books that I have read, I love this the best. I am a 31 year old adult and used this book over dr. phils and lost 15 lbs. Very easy and clear cut well worth adding to the library."
5,Love My Wallabees,"I Love 'em...I wore wallabees all thru school. I think it might have been the Seinfeld Show that made me switch to wearing tennis shoes with my jeans. Tennis shoes these days are so flamboyant. Stars, stripes, iridescent colors..... Not fittinfg for a 56 year old man. I went ""Old School"". I've worn my wallabees for 5 days and already got many positive comments. I was concerned about other comments on Amazon about sizing. I ordered my exact size and they fit perfect :) Im a Happy Camper :)"
5,Real. Comfortable. Shoes.,"The title sums it up but I'll break it down a little. These shoes are comfy, classic, timeless and stylish. The main attribute of these shoes is the level of comfort and support they provide. They offer great shock absorption and to top it off they are versatile and whenever you wear them you'll have comfort at your 'toe tips' (fingertips, get it?). I've always been a fan of the wallabees and I will always be. Get yourself a pair of these and you'll become a fan too."
4,Original Clarks were better,"The price was great.I bought my first Clarks from Glick Shoe in PA around 1970. Wow, what a great feeling! They were made in England.The new Clarks are not made in England. The leather is not as resistant to scuff marks. Also, the soles are thicker and give the feeling of less stability. It is like the effect of fastening blocks to the soles, only the wobbling effect is less noticeable, of course."
4,"They are as it looks in the picture, the shoes are very nice","I received the shoes yesterday in excellent packing condition, they look strong with a soft rubber crepe sole. The shoes have a very nice sporty design and new are very soft to walk on. I just hope they do not detached from the sole as I had this experience with the last shoes I purchased of Clark, but I took them for repairing to the cobbler, and still use it. I hope these last longer in better condition. Also, I want to inform that as a women I wear 9.5 but Clark only have this design for men, I took a risk with size 8, and fitted perfectly.We suggest staff from Clark have more control over your quality and thus retain your customers."
5,Pay to learn?,"It's great the truth be told about the 'Devil's Lettuce,' although the price of the book certifies the high price of knowledge."
2,Wasnt what I remember...,When I was a kid I loved this movie. So naturally I told myself I have to have this on DVD. Well needless to say I was very disappointed. I must have been a stupid kid cause I dont feel that the movie was a good as I remember.
3,"Great gloss, bad packaging","I really like this lip gloss. It doesn't stay for 10 hours, but a quick reapply of the gloss freshens it up nicely. The colors are very flattering - even the nude has a nice punch of color that brightens the face.However, the tubes themselves are terrible - they leak and get stuck closed. I went through three of them before I had to change my gloss. I really wanted it to work out because I like the actual gloss so much, but it got all over everything in my bag and half the time it wouldn't open to let me use it.I've gone to their color stay gloss and so far so good."
3,Too frosty,"I like the color, but the frost was too much. SuperStay is the best product for me so far and has a color I love. These stains a great only if you exfoliate your lips with a dry or wet washcloth before every application to get off the inevitable peely skin on your lips. Don't worry to scrub too hard, your lips can take it and you'll have smoother, softer ones that take any lipstick well to show for it!"
4,Fun for the first five minutes.,"This game is a great idea, the unfortunate problem is that there are not enough questions. We played this game the night we bought it, and after two full games with four people playing we had used every single card. VH1 just needs to make more questions, then perhaps I could be kinder."
2,Too Short,"This so-called document will probably be replaced with the longer almost complete BLUE WILD ANGEL documentary film. I just saw this 1 hour 40 min. doco on TV [SBS, Australia] last night and was amazed to find not only 13 of the 18 songs complete but also replete with between song misshaps and dialogue. The songs were also in the correct performance order. Yes, the complete versions of ""Machine Gun"" and ""Foxy Lady"" are here and yes, rare tracks like ""Ezy Rider"" also make their debut. The question is: will EH put out a VHS/DVD of the complete concert? WILD BLUE ANGEL is a marked 5 star improvement over this earlier version."
3,collectors piece,"you'll refer to this one now again, not often, but you'll be pleased you have it in the collection.the man is clearly from another planet."
2,excellent concert -- pitiful editing,"My favorite Hendrix concert, bar none -- but what a terrible job Alan Douglas did when editing this concert. Half the songs aren't there, and the ones that are, are all chopped down by the edge of Alan's hand.Wait till ""Blue Wild Angel"" is released (November 12th, 2002). It contains most of the songs in their original order (the ones not included were not filmed). Also, a double disc set featuring EVERY song from the concert makes its North American debut November 12th, as well. Check the ""Experience Hendrix"" website for more info."
5,Best Book For A New Home/Cabin Owner,"I bought an older edition of this book for my then five year old home a few years ago and kicked myself that I had not purchased it sooner. I was determined not to make that mistake again, so when my family decided to become cabin owners the first thing I did was order the lastest edition. I am very glad that I did. It has been very helpful."
5,The Home Owner's Journal by Colleen Jenkins,"My clients just loved it and are using it constantly has they make changes to their home.Any chance that realtors could get this at a discounted rate if they at least buy 10?? Would look forward to hearing from you.The Home Owner's Journal, Fifth Edition"
2,Impossible to slog through two discs,"I've heard a lot about Costello over the years and decided to give this set a try.Bad idea.His singing is grating,and well,the music is just plain mediocre.There is really nothing more you can say for it."
2,"Take a pass, Big Time","Although this was perhaps with the best intentions an interesting project, the execution leaves so much to be desired. The extended use of the stutter simply reveals one thing: As a remixer, Howe's son is a hack. I'm amazed that the Quality Control experts in the Yes camp let this one out.Prog Rock has been remixed/sampled/deconstructed before, first with the Prague Rock 12"" from Leaf, then on the Knots compilation (of Gentle Giant). Find those first."
1,Yes son meets Dad,"As a 50 year old Yes fan with such vivid and wonderful memories of Yes music and the late 60's and early 70's YES concerts filled with psychedelic magic, I let the son remix if Dad likes, but I certainly would not buy this."
1,Save your money and remix your own.,I get a simular remix by popping in one of my Yes CD's into my car's CD player and going for a drive over some of the local pothole lined streets.
1,leave it!,"There is no need to spend good money on this. Do what I did, get the remasters (all of 'em) they are totally brilliant, and get your daughter to put on her Craig David or whatever in the next room, playing at the same time!! It has the same effect believe me. Seriously, what a total waste of time and energy."
2,Not worth the money,I was looking for an instructional book on the techniques used in scratchboard art. This book is not what I was looking fo.
5,Outstanding reference guide!,"I normally don't like dummies books but this is one of the best ones I have seen. I would recommend it to anyone thinking of getting into Reiki or who is just curious about healing, meditation or visualization type practices."
1,Unpleasant subject matter...,"While I actually enjoyed most of the book, and found the mystery interesting, I could not recommend this book to anyone due to unpleasant and unnecessary items referenced in the book, such as bestiality (gross) and child molestation. Because of this I won't read anymore books in this series."
3,Does not live up to hype,"I read this book as the title and premise intrigued me. As I continued to read it hoping it would improve I was disappointed.The hype or endorsements on the book are way overrated.Its not a horrible book - it is a light read but I didn't laugh once even though it was supposed to be humorous.If you want humor (laugh out loud)and a light mystery try Maddy Hunter's books - I can't wait for her next one! But this author, well I might read her next one but it sure won't be on my must buy list."
2,Guardian Angels,"I really enjoy reading books about angels, but I was not too impressed with this book. It's very small, and I found it difficult to read. Nothing sets it apart from any other book on this subject. The price was great, but in this case it was a ""you get what you pay for"" kind of book."
3,Raspberry Tea,"I've looked for several years to find a Raspberry flavored tea, when I discovered this one. Thanks. It tastes really great!"
4,Entertaining,"I found this book to be a classic write of Nora Roberts romance, which I love, and entertaining from an artists perspective."
1,Turn down the suck!,"Okay, Anti-Flag is an amazing band and all their CD's are great--except this one. Which actually works out quite fine because it's not even really their CD, it's a rip-offof a live show by a dirtbag record label. If you buy this CD, you are in no way supporting Anti-Flag or A-F Records. Not only that but this CD sucks. Sure, it's live, but the sound quality is terrible if you compare it to other albums. Want a live album? Get Mobilize, half those songs are live and they definitely sound great."
5,Another good DK book,DK has done it again. A great kids book with wonderful pictures. The captions are descriptive and provide accurate information about flying machines. Not too much detail but enough for a beginner.
3,Not an attention keeper,"I bought this along with some other toys for my daughter when she was 1 yo to take on a flight to Hawaii. It did not keep her attention. Now that she is 2, she can figure it out quite quickly so it still does not hold her attention for long. I'm not quite sure for what age this is appropriate."
3,An okay book,Am giving 3 stars as I was not that impressed with the book. It wasn't what I was expecting. Sorry.
1,My daughter broken it in one day,It is totally garbage. Only one color paper with several plastic ball. This is the worst game board I have seen.
4,Great for small toys and parts,"Pretty easy to put together, takes some balancing with the pole parts....Very pretty side pieces with the princesses on them. I bought 2, so we have plenty of storage space. If I can put this together, so can you!"
4,This will get him noticed among the other rappers,I received a copy from the artist him self becausue he is my cousin.The album is good he has a dam good flow the beats are also good.My favorite track is UP TOWN.He is not in the main stream yet but when he is all the other rappers better watch out cause he will give them a run for there money.Louisiana has alot of great artists and he is definately going to be one of them.
1,Not satisfied at all!,"The shipping did take a good 2 wks before it got to me. Then the watch band clasps wont even close. Lastly the crystal of the watch is already blurry (foggy) from me washing my hands. So much for a ""water resistant"" watch. But what can you expect for 14.99? This was by far the worse purchase ever!"
4,Glad I found it,"I'm glad I found this - I was being nostalgic and really wanted to rewatch this wonderful series, especially with my pre-teen son.Whatever audio encoding was used does not work in my Sony bluray player. The set works fine on my other bluray player, so I am sure this is simply a lack of encoding support on the one player it doesn't work in, but it's still a bit annoying nevertheless. If it weren't for this, I would have given 5 stars."
5,Best show ever,"Eerie, Indiana in my words is a timeless classic, that just never gets old. It just sucked the series had to end so soon when it start developing into in my opinion if given more time. One of the most well written series out there. If you remember watching this show as a kid. Believe me this DVD is something worth having in your collection, and I hope one day they really make a movie out of it or something."
5,Excellent!,"My whole family loved this short lived series. We are enjoying seeing it again. The premise is based upon a boy, Marshall, whose family moves to a new town, Eerie, Indiana. The emphasis is on ""eerie"", not ""scary"". Marshall and his friend investigate the odd happenings around town. Among other revelations, you'll find out how a set of identical twins are able to look exactly the same as they did in a 30-year old yearbook."
4,"Overall, Fantastic","The beats on this album are incredible. Any true beat junkie would fall in love with this album as soon as they hear the hook to ""It's Over"" or ""Coming Through"". To add to that, both Jumbo and Vursatyl have incredible flow, rivaling Quannum labelmate Gift of Gab for complexity and depth,.A warning though - Lifesavas wear their politics and religion on their sleeves. Lines in ""Livin Time/Life: Movement 1"" and annoyingly preachy but somewhat funny ""State of the World"" defiantly declare their pro-life, traditional values stance. A few lines about cloning, abortion, and darwinism seemed really backward to me, so if you're really sensitive to those issues, give the whole album a listen first.but On the whole, though, Livesavas' message is positive, and the best parts of the album are just too hot for most hip-hop fans to miss out on."
3,Wanted more,"I liked this book. It was interesting to learn about how African belief systems were transformed in the New World--and how profit was made from those transformed beliefs, mostly by white people. The author danced around this contradiction a bit but never really addressed it. I wish she had.I felt disappointed by her section on High John the Conqueror Root. Her hints that the root is something other than Ipomoea jalapa were intriguing, but she never came to any conclusion about the herb's actual identity. This mirrored her hesitation about addressing the contradiction of white retailers selling the props of African American magic to black people.This book had a lot of nifty details, though. I thoroughly enjoyed finding out what Indio's incense powder is made out of, for instance."
5,perfect addition to my library,"I have been researching hoodoo and voodoo for the past two years, but none of the books I've come across compare to Spiritual Merchants. Not only is it honest, but it's simple...it reads almost like a conversation. I appreciate the oodles of images and merchants, especially since Long distinguishes between their races. Unfortunately, most of the web sites are defunct. I will treasure this book always!"
4,Informative insight,"William Barclay always provides easy to read, understandable commentaries on the New Testament. This book, taken in conjunction with his Commentary on the Revelation of John, provides a context in which the first readers of the seven letters would have understood them. Showing the history and culture of the cities in which the seven churches existed, as well as looking at the original Greek language and how it is translated, brings the reader back to the original intent of the letters, and then offers hints on how we can understand those letters in today's churches. Well worth the time and money to begin an understanding of one of the most difficult, misused and abused books in the Bible."
3,cut-off This Masquerade really blows!,"the recording is good, but i was pretty upset the first track- This Masquerade was brutaly cut short!! Way short! What a rip!"
5,¡A Great Album!,"Text-Spanish.Una excelente recopilaciòn, de uno de los artistas mas talentosos del siglo XX.A pesar de ser un artista comercial, Benson a sabido mantener el equilibrio entre el Jazz, el Pop y el R&B.La calidad del disco es magnìfica, por lo que esta es una buena opciòn para las personas que quieran conocer a este gran mùsico."
1,Never received it.,"I am very upset, I have not received this item or any of the items I purchased on this day."
1,Very Ordinary,"I found this product to be very ordinary, the kind of cheap tape that people put out years ago because past life regression was popular and people would buy anything. I found it useless. In fact, I don't think I'm going to buy any more tapes like this because I think there are now better ways to get into a state of mind where you can review past lives."
5,One of the best baseball books ever,"""Bang the Drum Slowly"" may be better known, and in some places more highly rated, but I enjoyed ""The Southpaw"" at least as much. Henry Wiggen is one of the most likable characters, even when he gets a little too big for his britches. And he is definitely a character, not far out of Mark Twain's central casting. Maybe things roll a little too easy for him and the Mammoths at times, but you're rooting for them all the way. If you like baseball fiction and haven't read ""The Southpaw"" yet, you owe it to yourself to order it. I've read it twice and will read it many more times."
4,Eleanor of Aquitaine: A Biography,"This book provides a detailed, insightful and thorough examination of a woman whose life would have been radical by modern standards. However, Eleanor lived nine centuries ago, in an age when patriarchial attitudes, values and mores were completely dominant. In such a world, Eleanor not only survived, she thrieved. The wife of two powerful Kings, Eleanor was a match for any man. She floutted convention, wearing armour and riding a charger on crusade, Eleanor remained sexually attractive enough to have the King of England, a man fourteen years her junior, marry her without regard for her lack of the normal virginal requirements of a queen consort."
3,"Somewhat disjointed, with an interesting twist","The cover photo is very misleading. From it and the title, I was thinking it was a story about the brotherly bond that develops between wingmen in a combat squadron.This isn't the case. I don't normally do fiction that isn't related to history, but I was definitely satisfied with this book. It was one that I can recommend."
4,Well Done!,"This book is very well done. I was at first worried because of the small number of pantheons listed, but each of the pantheons has a GREAT deal of information. Particularly, the Norse Pantheon is well done."
3,Nearly Worthless,"If you're not planning to have your characters directly face the gods, don't bother with this book. Over half of the treatise is information to set stats for divine beings and is filled out with the most basic information on how to role-play them (in a nutshell - act like an arrogant know-it-all, according to Wizards). Those familiar with the previous versions will be sorely disappointed to find that only the pantheons of Greyhawk, Egypt, Greece/Roman, Norse, a generic monotheistic and a new dualististic god fill the pages, and there is so much lost even in these pantheons.In the end, there isn't much to recommend in this book for anyone other than the DM, and even what is offered is of limited value."
4,Rich and Detailed for Roleplaying Ease,This is a grand piece for the 3E set. The book is both illustrious in it's presentation and informative in it's content. Those running in the Greyhawk world like our group will find it a much sought after piece. The book not only gives you alot of serious data on the pantheons of fantasy realms but also gives you information on how they interact. A section is devoted to creating your own devine rulers as well. Definately packed with things the munchkins want too like new spells and magic items. Definately worth the price.
2,Only for a select few,"If you're a DM and into using Dieties in your campaing, this book is pretty good. Otherwise, don't waste your money. The artwork is fantastic, but it has absolutely nothing to offer the average player. No new spells, domains, prestige classes (except 2 related to a minor god), etc. Just borrow your DM's copy and thumb through it."
3,Start with Volume 2,"The idea of exposing dub to the masses with fresh faces and mixes is a great idea, but Volume 2 of this series is better than this one. Start there, and if you dig it, know that this volume isn't all bad, but doesn't push the envelope anywhere near as much as vol. 2. Mostly for completists of the series or die-hard dub heads. Casual or new listeners? Go see volume 2."
5,Welcome Back Roland!,"This is a wonderful peice of work by Roland. Fresh, with just a hint of deja vu. Why on earth this has yet to be released in the states is beyond me. The first single ""Low Life"" is one of my favorites. I have followed his career for years. ""Elemental""- ""King of Spain""- but this is by far his best work ever."
2,Catatonic......,"....I'm sorry, Roland, not one of your best. I want more of the voice. The dreamy music drowned vocals. What happened to the soulful voice of ""I Believe"" and ""Woman in Chains"". I know there's a beautiful soothing voice somewhere, but it seems as though it's been buried. I liked Snowdrop, but I still strained to hear. Please bring your wonderful voice back into song."
5,Hypnotic,Roland keeps drawing me deeper and deeper into his Psyche..andI must admit...I am powerless . He's brilliant.
1,Wheels do not turn,We bought this for our 2 year old who loves these ride on toys. Unfortunately we had to return the item because the wheels do not turn without assistance and therefore the child and parent becomes very frustrated very quickly because it does not move around as it should.
5,Unexpected and Sophisticated Joy,"I am enthralled. I love Pergolesi, Hovhaness, Debussy, Satie, Dave Matthews. Listening to this album is an experience to treasure, again and again."
4,an insight into psychosis,"I once put in a couple of years working in a psychiatric hospital, so I had a lot of opportunity to talk to people who had delusions. Sometimes the delusions were quite elaborate. I remember talking to one highly intelligent patient who had been really out there in the Twilight Zone. After the medications had kicked in, and she and I were in that place that most of us take for granted as reality, I asked her what being psychotic was like. She said that what she was experiencing, as bizarre and nightmarish as it was, seemed utterly real and convincing and had its own internal logic like a vivid dream. Watching this movie is one way to understand what an experience like that might be like."
5,My favorite movie EVER,"Great movie great plot wonderful acting (duh, it's Sam Neill) anyway, I'm feeling lazy so I'm nto gonna write anymore than this. GO SEE IT NOW!"
5,Excellent,This is easily the best horror movie to come out of the '90s. Even after having seen it ten times (at least) I still find it scary. Creepy ambiance. Excellent.
3,IMoM-Cthuthlu meets King,Lovecraftian reference abound in this fine little nod to horror marketing. Weak ending but otherwise enjoyable excursion into Mythos madness.
4,"Strange, Surreal flick!","I basically liked this movie. It tends to be somewaht like a Stephen king's film but not quite. One major flow of this movie is that it just shows too much rather than leaving certain things to the viewer's imagination, Also some scenes are somewhat out of place. Overall: Good!"
5,"Watch This Movie, Be Scared, Question Reality.","This movie takes the concept of horror to a differnt level. The story centers on an insurance investigator who goes looking for the famous author Sutter Cane after he mysteriously vanishes before giving his latest manuscript, ""In the Mouth of Madness,"" to his publisher. The plot concept in this movie is mind-bending, beyond what any other movie I can think of has been able to reproduce. Definately a good addition to your DVD collection...that is, if you can handle it."
4,A lot better than I expected,"When this movie came out, the bad reviews I saw caused me to stay away. Then it turned up on TV and I said, ""What the hell, it's free."" I'm glad that I did.John Carpenter seems to have figured out what many other directors have failed to do; How to make a good Lovecraftian movie. Instead of attempting a direct adaptation, he's simply used similar theme's and ideas.While I found some of the effects looked a bit iffy, I found the story strong enough carry the film."
4,NEW WORLD ORDER: A LA LOVECRAFT,"This is one of the best scary movies ever. Now, if you are a hard-core horror movie fan, you probably are like me immune, meaning you probably won't get scare. Nevertheless, you will love this movie, and enjoy it. The story is about...well, us, the fans of horror. Is about the questions ""what is reality?, does reality exists?"". But, the main question is ""what if you are the only sane person in the whole world?"" Anyway, the movie is about a book so freaking real and scary that the readers (those who finish it) becomes psychopathic killers. The author goes missing and the company hires a man to find him. Is this quest for him that takes us to a lovecraftnian nightmare. You will love it!P.S. Even if I love a movie, I always recommend to rent it first. That way if you don't like it you won't lose money."
1,cowboy's head popped off irreparably after one hour of use,"This is a darling product. My son thought it was great too--until the cowboy's head came off. When this happened, the string that makes the cowboy gallop on the horse disappeared and the toy was useless. It was a sad, sad Christmas present."
4,Good reference for Nikon photographers,"Simple, easy to understand instructions/explanations on how to use your Nikon 995."
4,Quiet and Powerful,This fan definitely made a difference in my bathroom. It is quiet and moves enough air to keep the humidity down during hot showers. Well built fan!
3,Not bad...for a third installment,"The movie is surprisingly okay. I liked the idea of this ""Marilyn Manson"" type character playing one of the heroes of the film who at first is against God in his music but eventually sees the light and embraces God towards the end. The only thing I didn't care for in this movie is the actor Craig Sheffer and why his character is supposed to be one of the heroes for the film...AGAIN. I say again because he is also in the first sequel to the Turbulence series yet he's playing a different character and I guess we're just supposed to forget that the actor was in the second film playing the hero? The sad thing is I didn't even like either of his characters...but the films are alright."
2,Useless,"The title is highly misleading. Many of the recipes have 50, 60, even 70 grams of carbohydrates per serving. Also, for anyone who actually knows how to cook, many of the ""recipes"" are pathetic. For example, the recipe for spiced nuts involves putting spices and nuts in a bag and shaking, that's it, no roasting, caramelizing, etc. Another recipe instructs you to roll strips of scallion and bell pepper up in ""lunch meat"" with mayonnaise). I've looked through this book twice now and found nothing I want to make. I highly doubt I will ever pick it up again."
5,The Best Bedding For Rabbits,"This is the best bedding for rabbits. We have been using it for almost 4 years and have tried others and keep coming back. It is not dusty, it is comfy for the rabbits, and does not leave an oder, even if left for an extended time. It is also safe for animals because it is made from recycled paper and not wood chips or other toxic materials. We use it as bedding and as litter in their boxes and LOVE IT. The only con is that it is heavy compared to similar products but that isn't a big deal at all - in fact that may even be a pro the way you look at it."
4,"Great, fun CD.","This CD is so awesome I just can't stop listening to it. The songs are all really fun and remind me of other dance/rock bands like ABBA, the B:52's, Wham, and punk bands like the New York Dolls. If you want to pick up a cd that's fun to listen to and great to amuse/shock/impress your friends with pick this one up."
1,AWFUL!!!!!!,"Don't even buy this album if you wanna save money. This is the worst album of all time and you will be disappointed if you hear this album. Believe me. No other album can compete against this album. Not any other album on this Earth, not albums in 50's,60's or 70's. No decade. The only good song is ""Don't Stop the Beat"". The song ""Who Are You Gonna Do Tonight"" is just plan nasty. It sounds stupid at that. Mark my words do not get this album!!!!"
3,"Party Music, the Wave of the Future","Junior Senior are two dudes from Denmark(?) Junior is the musician/vocalist and Senior is the rapper/singer... . This is good stuff. Unabashedly cheesy party rock with some disco, funk, and hip hop thrown in for good measure. This stands alongside Beck's Midnite Vultures, Kinky's self titled, and OutKast's Aquemini as an all around get down album. It dares you not to dance with abandon. The riffage is punky and excellent. The chants and shout outs are great. The tongue in cheek styling is ironic and yes cheesed up to the max but damn it rocks and I like it and I wish more bands would start playing music like this. Party on!"
2,Overly depressing,I normally love historical fiction but this book is just gut wrenching the whole time. It was just too much. Just one horrible thing after another. I really wanted to like it but didn't think the love story made much sense.
4,An excellent biography but a bit dry at times,"This is an excellent biography. The only reason I rate it 4 stars rather than 5 is that it is a bit dry at times, especially when Guelzo drops out of what I call his narrative biography mode and into his history lecture mode. During those times, I was tempted to ask, ""Is there going to be a test next week?"" :)Nevertheless; I've read six other bios of Lincoln and what makes this one especially interesting and unique, as far as I know, is that rather than exploring his life only through his actions, it explores his intellectual and political development and his growth as a religious seeker. The author then uses those observations to try to explain not only Lincoln's Civil War accomplishments but also his domestic policy achievements.I apologize if this review has also drifted into ""the lecture mode."" I do highly recommend this book for both the academic and general reader."
2,For fanatics only?,"I came of age as a baseball fan in the 70s, so sure, I read this from cover to cover and got some warm fuzzy nostalgic feelings. As to what the players actually say....well, you know those post-game interviews that consist of not much more than ""I love this game, it's been a thrill, as long as I can contribute to the team I'm happy, thanks to my manager for all the faith he's had in me, etc., etc.""? I won't say these interviews are THAT vapid, but it's pretty close. I wasn't looking for a ""Ball Four"" type of thing filled with gossip and scandals, but STILL...."
5,Naot kayla,"This is my favorite sandal! I would have it in every color if they were less expensive...as it is, I have four pairs...thanks for making them available in so many colors! I have a narrow foot so it is a perfect style for me! I am a Naot fanatic!"
1,Fluff and filler with no meat.,"I read this book in hopes that it would indeed help me to start repairing my credit. It is all fluff and filler as my title states. It doesn't really explain to you how to do anything. It definitely doesn't help anyone dealing with collection agencies. It doesn't tell you anything about debt validation, which a collection agency is required to provide upon request. Honestly this doesn't even touch the tip of the iceberg.My summary of the book which will save you the cost of buying: pay your bills on time, check your credit report at least once a year, if your score is low you won't get anything, oh and this guy ran a credit counseling agency."
1,This book is pathetic!,"This book is pathetic! It is the absolute worst way to waste your money!I got about a third of the way through this book. It is mostly fill to consume the pages so that there is a few pages of blah blah blah.Don't waste your money on this pathetic book. But worse, don't waste your time. Time is more valuable spending on something else.I cannot imagine why anyone would give this book a positive rating. The fact that someone does give this book a positive rating reduces my confidence in any other positive rating on Amazon."
1,not good,big house usa got stuck several times. and i had to miss a good chunk of the movie because of it. and i have a special dvd player that usually nothing skips or gets stuck on.
1,Fabolous bad,"This CD is great. This CD is the best one I've ever heard. I could say this now, but I won't do that.I thought, that it is cool after I heard ""Can't deny it"". Well, ""Can't deny it"" and""Get smart"" are good, yes, but the other 12 songs are worse thaneverything else I've ever heard. Well, there are many bad rapperbut he is the worst. I give an advice: Put your money on other CDs, everything would be better than ""Ghetto Fabolous""."
3,Fabolous is movin' on up...,"Fabolous is aight in my words, but he needs some experience. I mean, getting Nate on your debut CD deserves props, but you need more experience. I do like the song with Nate, but get some more..."
1,GHETTO GARBAGE!!!,Who does this guy think he's fooling into believing that he has talent?This guy would still be in the ghetto if it wasnt for his producer doing all the work for him.This album sucks because its way too commercial and cheesy.There are no good songs on the entire album.He claims in the lyrics that he is a gangster but he looks more like a black justin timberlake.What exactly is fabolous about the ghetto?This guy will be just another nelly type of rapper who was famous for a very brief period of time.DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GARBAGE!!!
5,Ghetto!,"Ghetto Fabolous is one of my favorite albums 2 listen 2. it's far from a classic but it is far from garbage(dumbasses). Fabolous is my favorite rapper so maybe i'm feelin this album 2 much. but i like it. i like how it's street. wut can i say but Fab u put it down!best tracks:Gotta Be ThugKeepin It GangstaCan't Deny ItRide for ThisGet Smartgo get it if u ain't already, pce"
4,Not hatin,If you don't like this album...you are hatin. To the folks that wrote reviews on this album and dissed the work and creativity behind it...shame on yall. If you were black and dissed the album...double shame on yall. How are black folks supposed to do anything positive in this world when they struggle against the negativity that people like you present to them everyday when they try to do something legit? This is a slammin album...you gon love it.
1,Why????,"Why is Fabolous so popular right now? It all has to do with being in the right place at the right time I guess. The only reason his first single was good was because Nate Dogg appeared on it. Fabolous sounds like a even more nasal version of Mase and it's hard to sound more nasal than Mase. Plus, ""Get Right"", the remake of the Junior Mafia-Biggie song, falls so flat it should be illegal. This definitely was one of the worst songs of 2001, possibly one of the worst songs ever made in hip-hop. Fabolous should keep his day job because sooner or later when there's a new person the media will ride on and kids will start buying that, he'll be needing it. If you want a great album from 2001, try D.P.G.: Dillinger & Young Gotti, or Nas: Stillmatic. Those albums will make a much better impression on the listener than this will. Sorry to bash this album, but it is, from all honest viewpoints, wack."
2,Get Your Shine On,"Fabs, you had some hot cameos and everything, but this isn't going to be your best work. He'll shine, but don't look for him to make a career out of rapping. Yeah he'll shine, but did I tell you it's like comparing a candle to the sun, that... just don't even out."
4,Good CD,"Now I'm not prone to hip-hop or rap much (unless it's a certain style and has a good backing melody). Not because I think it's stupid, it just ain't my cup of tea. But Fabolous caught my ear in 2001 and I haven't been able to get over this CD ever since. ""Can't Deny It"" is by far one of the best tracks on the entire album, but ""Young'n,"" ""Get Smart"" and ""Ma' Be Easy"" are all great cuts too. This album is the dope and is a great buy for any hip-hop or rap music listener."
5,"Raw, Young, Hip flows","I think this is a really slick C.D. and that Fabolous is a raw new young artist with a whole lotta flow. He brings a lot of peep to his music and he speaks the truth which is the best way to keep it gangsta. He's new, he's young and has a lot of catchy songs that seem to just stick in your head. And I'm really feel'in the song with that Scarface skit."
5,Off da hook,This CD is off the hook. All the beats are tight and while the lyrics may be a little stupid I'm glad i took the chance and bought this CD. I would recomend this for anybody who liked his first single.
4,A must for lovers of the West Wing!,"I first read this book 2 years ago after purchasing it from Amazon, and loved it the moment I saw it. Sitting down to read it was almost like opening a chocolate box, with wonderful anecdotes from dozens of men and women who have served in the nexus of American Military decision making. I highly recomend this book to anyone who would like to find out more about the White House Situation room and it's impact on the world and the West Wing itself."
2,Buyer beware,"Just be sure to read up on this closely... it's not the orchestra you hear in the movie, and you may be especially disappointed when you hear the vocal tracts - gone are great talents Enya and Annie Lennox, replaced by no-name voices. This is not BAD music, but don't think you're a genius for capturing the music of the movies on one inexpensive 2-CD set."
5,Better than the sound track,"This is Shore's selection of ""best of"" the movie soundtrack. Written as a symphony it moves through the movies without getting hung up with repitition of sound track. I like it better. Great background when studying."
2,forget this so so show because...,here comes MAUDE season 1 and $10 cheaper but a whole lot better !
5,Courageous,"One of the best movies, Christian or otherwise that I have ever seen. The old movie trailers used to say, ""You'll laugh, you'll cry..."" except that this one will actually do that while cementing the role of fathers in our church and society. Great, great film."
5,Amazing Film for ALL Parents!,"This film was amazing. It made me laugh, it made me cry, but most importantly it made me commit to being a better mother. The spiritual aspect was great, though I would like to see more spirituality in these films than is normally portrayed. It even made a good impression on my kids. They like seeing films that support their own Christian convictions because they don't get too much support in that area with most of their peers and out in the world. It makes them feel that they aren't so strange after all and supports them in continuing to walk the walk with Jesus. We are looking forward to the next film by these amazing folks!"
2,The God Who Wasn't There,"Saw this on a bus in Peru yesterday. Excellent moral lessons whose truths are not found exclusively in ""scripture.""One does not need to be a Christian or Bible reader to be a moral, responsible person. Have a look at ""The God Who Wasn't There."""
5,Movie with a moral,A movie with a consistent moral story of the importance of fathers in the lives of their children especially teaching by example.
1,OH NO!!! NOT AGAIN!!!,"Oh Swell! Another one of these badly acted, poorly written pieces of Christian propaganda. This tripe is an insult to filmmaking in general, and to anyone with a discerning mind. They show this junk in churches for free because no one in their right mind would pay to watch anything with the Kendrick name on it. It's sad to think that they manage to find money to make this drivel, and worse that there are braindead religious puppets who claim that it is ""great filmmaking."" It is my sincere hope that these rank amateurs never waste another moment of celluloid time on feces like this."
1,God awful,"This movie is horrible! And frankly I want my money back Amazon! Yes,I should of read the reviews first as I did not realize this was a christian movie. My husband and I could not even finish watching it. The acting was awful and the movie was slow. It seemed as though they put every race into their stereotypical role and the white man was there to save them. I honestly felt they threw in a black cop as not to seem racist. It was horrible, just horrible. Do not rent this movie!!"
2,didn't finish watching it..,"It was over the top sappy, we didn't finish watching it. The acting was poor. I think this is probably a better movie for a religious retreat.. that I would never go on."
2,Not what I expected,"While I definitely don't have anything against movies with a Christian theme, I thought this one lacked any real plot and the acting was definitely not worthly of an Academy Award. The movie stopped about 3/4 of the way through and to be quite honest, I really didn't care. It just kept we from watching the rest of it. It was just a very tired movie."
4,Great product,"Thank you for sending my order in such good condition. It was a used video but it is in very good condition and a wonderful movie. I had seen it before but, didn't want to pay the price I had seen it at. When I noticed the price on Amazon,.com I knew this was an affordable item for our family. Thank you"
5,Truly motivating,"Human frailty, human strength, divine intervention, faith, family, humor, tough love, consequences, redemption, forgiveness, and a compelling story line... this movie has it all. A couple of the actors are a little stiff, and the story requires Kleenex at a couple of points, but through it all, you see the hand of God in the lives of the characters and it all comes together in a phenomenal way. Everyone needs to see this, several times a year, in fact."
5,Amazing movie for the whole family!,Another wonderful movie from the Kendrick brothers! Well put together and spiritually moving film for the whole family. I would highly recommend seeing it and buying the movie. You won't regret it!!
5,You have to watch this one!,"Another example of an awesome Christian oriented family movie! My family cried, laughed and experienced many emotions that had us on the edge of our seat."
4,Cruciflicks' Review,"""... you sure can tell the crew at Sherwood Baptist have grown when it comes to their film ministry. ""Courageous"" is the church's fourth release, and they've come an unbelievably long way since their first film, 2003's ""Flywheel."" The production value, acting, directing, music, and writing have all improved by leaps and bounds..."" -Lance; Cruciflicks Co-Founder""...I found tears in my eyes. The message was relatable to me, and I think anybody with an open mind could relate to it in one way or another."" -Mary; Cruciflicks Co-FounderFor the rest of our reviews on this and other faith based films, check out cruciflicks.net where ""We don't judge people, just the movies they make."""
3,good movie,acting leaves something to be desired but a good story. I watched it on netflix and bought two copies for my daughters families
2,movie--courageous,I enjoyed this video for values contained in the plot--for one man's change of attitude toward his family when a child dies and his committment to be a better father--how this change affected his friends and how they made changes in their own lives.
3,Moving Movie with Religious Message,"Not quite the movie I was expecting after reading the synopsis and then watching it. The movie is very dramatic and the spirit of humankind shows through. The movie had me weeping at times because of the moving story line. I was a little put off by all of the religious references as it seemed to take over from the story line at times. Being a woman, I also wasn't a big fan of how the men were represented as being more holier than women. I realize in religion women were not held in highest regards, so perhaps this is why the filmmakers did this. Those items being said, I did think the movie was wholesome and worth the watch. I rented this online at Amazon."
5,Courageous,I enjoyed this movie. I'm tired of movies that use profanity and nudity. This movie was wholesome and clean and well acted. I recommend it to everyone.
5,Great movie!!!,"My husband and I have appreciated so much the first three movies produced by Sherwood Baptist Church, and so we were really eager to see Courageous. Before I could obtain a copy for us a friend loaned us his copy. We watched it three times in three days. What a blessing! I ended up ordering one for each of our grown children as well as ourselves. I wish that all fathers could see this film and take seriously the message it puts forth to them. What a different country (and world) we, and our children, and our children's children, etc., could be living in. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who is serious about being a Godly parent and raising up Godly children to make a positive difference in this world."
5,Be a Courageous man of God,"When I saw this movie in theaters, I knew I would be adding this to my collection. But I soon realized that this movie alone is not enough to help one understand how Important to be a father. I highly recommend this movie, and the book(s) that goes along with it: The Resolution for Men (if female: The Resolution for Women).The movie has a powerful message, and it is evident in the lives of many men and women in our great nation.""As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord"" --Joshua 24:15"
1,False introduction,"I bought this movie because of Meng Fei, however, he is not in the movie at all. Any way, it is a very bad movie. It is not worth watching."
1,Dressmaker II .... Waste of time and money,"Horrible little machine. Skips stitches, can't controll tension, repeatedly broke thread (no matter what quality used), makes strange noises. To make matters worse, no availability of customer service. No response to emails or phone calls. I got it to just do some straight edge sewing and hemming. Couldn't even do that."
1,Don't buy this machine!,This machine is horrible! Can't even make simple projects without having multiple problems. Instructions are useless too. Buy a nicer machine and save yourself the hassle and fustration.
5,The Differencing Between Leading and Managing,"In a long working career I have observed numerous instances of the high management manage companies with very few examples of them leading the company somewhere. I worked for Univac for instance, saw them merge with Burroughs, and watched as they turned two five billion dollar companies into one six billion dollar (with a loss in 2006 of almost $300 million). I watched Digital Equipment completely misunderstand the impact of the PC and go from a major player to be part of Compaq, then part of HP.While this was happening, Microsoft and Intel were truly exercising the leadership that took the computer world through what Andy Grove (of Intel) called an inflection point.This book is a collection of six essays. The first three discuss leadership. The second three discuss the management aspect. It's a quick easy read, and while there is little practical 'do it this way' advice, the overall impact is just what a true leader needs."
2,"Some highlights, but Skynyrd can't match old glory","As a huge fan of the original Skynyrd, I was excited and impressed with the 1987 Tribute reunion tour featuring 5 former members, with Johnny Van Zant (Ronnie's younger brother) and a new 3rd guitarist (original guitarist Ed King who left the band in 1974 even rejoined). In concert, Johnny sounded and even looked the part of his older brother Ronnie. The band seemed earily like the original.Unfortunately, this album doesn't match the old glory or the heights of the 87 tour. The guitars don't sound as fresh (much thicker, crunchier tone) and Johnny sounds too redneck. Pure and Simply is the highlight of the album, and while the rest are certainly listenable, nothing stands out. Unlike the Allman Brothers Band which has put some of the best material of their career in the 90s, Skynyrd has not matched their previous magic."
1,Nope,"Emotionless and shallow, and not nearly as interesting as their other albums. Some people toss around the word ""sellout"" with reckless abandon, but it seems to fit these fine folks perfectly. Leave it alone, and maybe it'll go away."
5,The Golden Hum is one in a million!,The Golden Hum is a grat Cd the first time I heard the song Save Me as the opening song of the WB Show Smallville I knew that I had to have this Cd. I loved it! All of the songs are great the songs have a great beat to it and it just puts you in a great mood this applies for all of the other CDs as well! If you like R.E.M then you will like Remy Zero. The Golden Hum is a great Cd and its a have to have. The lyrics are great and so is the beat. Its Awsome!!!!! :)
1,absolute CRAP,"This had a lot of decieving reviews. It does not look realistic at all, it just looks like a badly made toy. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!"
1,Too small. Does not look real at all.,"This mouse probably isn't but an inch wide & 2 inches long. It is really small. It does not look nothing like the picture.It is also darker in color, almost a brown color. Totally fake looking."
2,Epic Fail,"I bought this due to the really good reviews. I was awfully disappointed when I received the actual product. I used it on my roommate who didn't even scream, but just asked what one earth was on her night stand. The second time I used it I got a scream that only caught the (failed) victim off guard for a mere millisecond. I highly recommend everyont not to buy this product if your intention is to scare people."
5,Rubber Rat-ical dude!,Bought this to scare a co-worker. Never used it. Sitting in a drawer now. Looks real. Feels rubbery. Might try to eat it if I get locked in the office some day.
1,this tv show stinks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,another boring dvd release this dvd an the tv show itself is one big major epic fail!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i totally hate this tv show with a firey passion ever since this was put on the air i hated it with a firey passion!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,This is one of the best collections I'd say ever.,"In case you didn't read the top of the questionaire I said ""This is one of the best collections of music I've ever heard."" I love how you have contemporary with classical, that's very in right now, and I think most of us music lovers feel the same way.Thank you, .JB."
3,pretty much the book to a T,"The movie was much better than the original, and it also followed the book very well. I found it very easy to follow and a very interesting film to watch. I would recommend watching it without hesitation."
5,Heartbreaking,"As I believe that just about everything that can possibly be said in praise of Adrian Lyne's adaptation has been eloquently done so by the previous posters, I will keep this short. Lyne's LOLITA is quite simply one of the most heartrending films I have ever seen. I was so affected by Jeremy Iron's incredible performance as Humbert Humbert that I am still shaking from its aftermath. That final scene in which Humbert stands on the hilltop, his face speckled with the blood of the man he felt had destroyed his happiness and in which he fully regrets his past actions that have lead to the destruction of a young girl's innocence, will stay with me forever. Kudos to you, Mr. Lyne for your integrity in standing firmly beside a film that you obviously believed in very strongly. The end result is a staggering achievement."
5,A true love stroy,"I read the book first, myself, which I recommend you do as well. Adrian Lyne truly captures the spirit of this book. I couldn't have picked a better person to plays Humbert then Jeremy Irons. I, myself, am surprised that he would partake in such a ""controversial"" although I am glad that he did. This film is not that explict. There is no direct nudity from Irons or Swain, who plays Lolita, although there is from Frank Langella, who plays Clare Quilty, but it is only for approx. 5mins. This movie is spellbinding, and the characters are brilliantly carried out. I was expecting more from Melanie Griffith myself but Dominque Swain truly captures Lolita. Kudos to her for her first feature film. A MUST SEE!"
1,Lolita DVD,This DVD was not formatted to play on players in the USA. Next time I will check it out before I buy.!
2,Disappointed,This did not come in the same finish as shown. It came in a red finish - I think it was supposed to be a cherry finish but it was actually red. Amazon will not give a refund or exchange for this because it's considered a food product. So I'm stuck with a product that I don't like and don't want.
2,Good for 10 smashes...,"This football plays Vikings chants and music when you clap it. Everything was working as intended but after about 10 times clapping it, either the speaker broke or the batteries were dead - making it pretty much worthless."
4,Alternative Christian Rock band I miss.,"I loaned this CD out and never got it back. So good, I had to buy another copy.Really enjoy 3/4 of the CD. Especially In my Shoes, and What I need. Excellent vocals. A little too metal at times, but that's a matter of opinion."
4,"Scholarly, with a touch of humor",Definitely readable. A must for 'Casey' fans and for school libraries.
5,A focus on how passion can be retained through the years,"What happens to sexual drive after the age of 50? There may be changes, but it doesn't dry up, so read Dr. Ruth K. Westheimer's Dr. Ruth's Sex After 50: Revving Up The Romance, Passion & Excitement! to find out what physical and psychological changes actually lend to sex after 50. Sex therapist Westheimer discusses romance and passion as well as these changes, providing a focus on how passion can be retained through the years."
2,Barely play it,"Same basic questions over and over, this game will be spending most of its time in the closet."
2,Remember why we started watching,"Does anyone remember that we started watching asian horror because it was fresh and different? Now they all seem to fit a standard pattern. Subtle tones, creepy longhaired brat, drag in the middle, stunning realization at the end. I'm starting to long for zombie flicks and torture genre's of good ole USA."
1,NOT so good- I was dissapointed,The movie was not that great. It jumped around a little too much. It was no SILK
1,Worthless garbage,"I don't know what the manufacturers of this R/C were thinking, other than ""let's sell a bunch of things that don't work, and hope nobody finds us...""The problems:The battery well is too far forward, giving the plane a fwd C.G.(that means the plane nose dives every time)The horizontal stabilizer has the camber on the top (adding to the nose down problem)The structure is made of expanded styrofoam, which is fine until it hits something (the ground?), and then it snaps.The rudder servo does not have enough power to turn the rudder both ways.It is only a 2 channel radio (throttle and rudder)There is no landing gear (the box says ""steerable nose gear)Stay away from this junk!"
1,Stay away from this plane!,"My son waited two weeks to get this plane. What a disappointment. First attempt to fly it dropped like a rock. At a gentle toss, full throttle at about 5 feet it fell and the nose piece and part of the wing fell off. The only way this plane will fly is if you attached helium balloons to it. Save your money, don't buy this 'airplane'."
1,Fiasco,"The only think is true on the box is ""the plane is simple to assemble""The design has a big flaw: the weight of the battery. The battery cells are so heavy that the plane would need three engines to thrust it and take off. The box say ""This strong ""jet"" plane is made of poly plastic"" The plane is made with expanded polystyrene (EPS), so fragile that it takes one foot tall fall to break any part.Byers BEWARE!"
1,Dive Bomb!,This thing looks cool...but that's about it! As the previous previews say...it doesn't fly at all...maybe if it had a stronger motor..and landing wheels.
3,Definitely more for a guy,"I bought these glasses for myself because of the tremendous sale price, but ended up passing them on to my husband. They definitely have a more masculine look to them.The glasses came nicely packaged, and seem to be of some quality."
4,I Love this Guy,"Jeff is truly a hysterical comic. He's even funnier live, so if you get a chance to see him at club you should check him out. He is the ultimate redneck."
2,This book got me yelled at.,"At first glance, this book is a valuable resource for anyone wanting to build their own castle, keep, or even manor house out in the countryside. It has a great deal of information and makes it relatively simple for whatever you're doing.And then you try to use it.It seems that whoever wrote this book doesn't own a copy of the basic Player's Handbook, since even a basic tavern for a rough-and-tumble crowd costs over 20,000 gold, when you can buy two galleons for the same price. Heaven forbid you should want to serve wine - that makes it almost 40,000. My players yelled at me when I first started trying to use these figures, and rightly so.This book could have been a lot more than it was made to be. As it is, it simply isn't scaled to the economy given in the core books. It could serve as a point of inspiration for a DM's own material, but that's it."
4,A good toy for all ages,I'm enjoying my purple Slinky a lot. I keep it on my desk to fidget with at times when I'm thinking about a project.
2,Not as good as a metal one,"The plastic Slinkys are a piece of junk compared to the metal ones, but the plastic ones are better for very young children."
4,Great for watching Lewis show off his cricketing skills!,"Deceived by Flight is not one of Morse's best episodes, but I enjoyed it nevertheless. The Clarets XI old boys' cricket team gather in Oxford for the annual cricket match, but the murder of one of the team members throws everything into disarray. Enter Inspector Morse (John Thaw) who knowing his DS, Lewis (Kevin Whately) is quite a cricket player himself, puts Lewis to work, going undercover as the newest member of the team!This interesting turn makes this story quite refreshing, and though I'm not a cricket fan, I could not help but smile as I watched Lewis have fun, for once showing off his skills, and relishing every moment in the spotlight!"
1,"smells, allergy","It is good concept to learn math using little blocks. Unfortunately, it smells bad and my daughter started to cough right after she sits nearby this toy. She is not allergy to plastic that doesn't smell. Unfortunately it is hard to find non-smell plastic. And plastic stuff are usually colorful and light and attractive to her. I do believe plastic toys can be made without bad smells. I recall a decade ago most plastic products have a mild smell that is not offensive. Now it is different. I paid $17 including S&H. Now that is a waste of money and a suffer bought for my daughter. She loves using her little hands to link little blocks. This is frustrating. I give one star to bad smelling toys. This one is not exceptional."
2,There are much better options,"I've been using this scale for several weeks and I regrettably can only say it is marginally OK and there are certainly much better scales out there. The scale itself seems decent. I have compared my weight on this scale to my weight on other trusted scales and it is accurate enough. I haven't seen any of the fluctuations seen by other reviewers.The body fat measurer is not reliable. I've seen my body fat numbers jump by almost 4% in a single day, which is obviously not physically possible. I would have to estimate the accuracy at +/-3%, so it's really only useful for seeing long term trends, maybe.The build quality is low. In the first week the start button became stubborn and I had to jiggle it to get the thing to work, but since then it has been OK. The buttons definitely have a cheap feel to them."
1,Total Propaganda,"In her zeal to discredit Alfred Kinsey Dr. Reisman allows her bias to become embarrassingly apparent. Her arguments are not supported by fact, and even the most casual of research reveals that many of her claims are false. While Alfred Kinsey's research makes fascinating study (his methodology was flawed making his findings questionable) Dr. Reisman (the Ph.D. is in communications, by the way) is more concerned with distorting the truth to support her agenda. She is admittedly opposed to homosexuality (she basically argues that all homosexuals are [...]), which is absolutely her right; however, he willingness to lie and deceive (the factual errors in this book were deliberate, I'm sorry) is quite shocking."
4,Good food with no corn,"My 2 ferrets seem to enjoy this food just as much as any and it has no corn. The ingredients look to be relatively healthful and its not super spendy. My only gripe and the reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because one of my ferrets gets the little triangle pieces stuck in the roof of her mouth sometimes and I have to pry it out with my finger (ferrets have sharp teeth). Maybe they could make the pellets square shaped to avoid this or maybe my ferret is just special, the world may never know."
2,It's OK,It works for a starter but get it as cheap as possible. Brush technique is lacking. Colors are listed in the text.
4,Nice paper,"I bought this paper to use it for Calligraphy purposes. Even though it was a bit on a shiny side, I like the quality of it: my ink (India Ink works the best) doesn't bleed. I use the technique for cardaking (I mount it on a cardbase) - so I wish it was heavier, but it will do. Does anyone know a good heavy matte non bleed paper?"
5,Cindy Walter's Snippet Sensations Bouquets,This book was very helpful when I made my own snippet bouquet wall hanging. Great book!
2,Too Vague,Although the projects shown are lovely the instructions are general and vague. The how-to pictures are too few and far between. The book is small and the price is too high.
2,Funny the first 2 times,"Great, but not so funny after the 1st or 2nd you watch it. I would netflix it or down load it from some site files tube dot com."
1,truly abysmal,"My wife gave up on it after a half hour. I wanted to like it (hey, I paid $4.00 to rent it) so I made it another half hour before turning it off. The script is awful and the film is an embarrasing mess.Actually, when I was 12 I might have found the vomiting gags amusing. It's hard to imagine why Ben Stiller and Drew Barriemore were willing to stoop to these kinds of antics. I lost an hour I can never get back."
2,Would be GREAT! If it was a 25 minute film.,"This movie started off with premise. Although I hate the actors in it, I wanted to give it a chance. The first 20 minutes was good. Then it got old. Really quickly. It's still old. Make it STOP. The slapstick is stupid. The acting is horrid. The idea is something because as you know this happens all the time and I have been through something similar myself. But do yourself a favor and pass on this movie. If you have to watch it, make sure you don't pay for it, record it on Tivo first and fast forward it every couple of minutes. I gave it 2 stars, cause...well..I was trying to be nice."
3,DUPLEX,"Charming, inoffensive and generally amusing tale of frustration and urban angst. Ben Stiller and Drew Barrymore are highly convincing as the (mostly) innocent young couple who get more than they bargain for out of their first home in the shape of an elderly tenant upstairs with an uncanny talent for pushing their buttons. How far can the old woman go, and how long can Stiller and Barrymore hang on? Lots of funny moments topped off by a delicious and ever-mounting anxiety. Stiller is particularly great as the struggling writer."
4,Great choice for a compact dictionary,"With over 55,000 entries, including idioms and slang, this is one of the better English-Hebrew/Hebrew-English dictionaries I've seen. The print is small, but the printing quality is superb.The paper is a fine-milled ""bright white"" paper, with true black printed text that is crisp and easily defined. The Hebrew is pointed and contains all vowels - which is really required for a reference that has an audience of those new to the language. The Hebrew is pointed in both halves of the book, so English readers needing to look up a Hebrew word to find its English definition will find it that much faster.This book is not perfect... it says it is ""Up-to-Date"" but doesn't include such words as ""SPAM,"" ""Internet,"" or ""e-mail."" Considering the limited offering of such dictionaries, however, this one stands out as one of the best (so far)."
3,Author doesn't understand point of view,"This book sounded interesting but I was immediately put off with the first chapter being from the point of view of a five-year-old. The author gave Euphemia observations and thoughts and language far beyond her years. So, what we really had was the author's point of view, not the child's.I found it irritating. Just didn't work for me."
5,a gift,bought this as a gift for my sister. she enjoyed the movie so much i thought i would give her the book to read
2,Buy this one USED!,"This book does have some cultural/sociological worth, but if you buy it new, you've got gross emotional problems. Buy it used--as long as you can find a dependable seller, and it looks like there's a good one already up here, you'll be much happier for it. Trust me on this one--save the few dollars and the years of therapy."
4,An Upgrade,"I've been working with Adobe Acrobat 5 for years, it was time for an upgrade, but I didn't want to spend a fortune on the new version. This was a compromise.It creates a much cleaner pdf than 5 did, and it was much faster. However there were some flukes (as with any software) romping over my preferences - ie it conflicts with the new Adobe X Reader plug-in for browsers and causes pdf files not to display in a web browser. They can still be shown locally. I simply uninstalled and re-installed and set my preferences again.All in all, it's a good upgrade compromise."
3,This sucks,This sucks. It is smaller than the original one. In the hands of a three year old it is not too durable. Some how they will find a way to tangle it beyond belief. Don't buy it
3,Mini -- Won't climb down stairs,"I didn't realize when I bought it that this was a ""mini"" version. The one thing I really wanted my daughter to see it do - climb own stairs by itself - it's too small to do. Will have to go back and buy the full-size one."
2,"This book is terrible, but, sadly, I've read worse","Sally Wentworth always wrote very well, her prose attentive and skillful, but this book was bizarre. Hugo holds his wife Kate captive, thinking she lied about being a virigin and has now cheated on him. She's a virgin, of course, but he accuses her of being the sluttiest slut who ever did slut. Honestly, I think Hugo was turned on by the idea...but disgusted at himself for being turned on, so he takes his aggression out on the heroine/victim.This book is missing a critical piece in a romance novel: any semblance of romance. There is no communication, only accusation, abuse, torture, stubbornness, pride and outright stupidity. If the author had included some inkling of a love and affection between the two characters, some sort of true remorse or process of healing, perhaps it could have been redeemed. The Judas Kiss by Sally Wentworth is one my favorite Harlequin Presents. Shattered Dreams is on the other side of the spectrum."
4,finding out something from the past,"I bought this book after I saw some of Don Normark's pictures in a local gallery. I was impressed with his work that I had to have the book. After reading the book and trying to see the pictures as he did, I realized that this was more that just a photo book. This was history and how these people lived. This could have been written in 2008, the same problems and the same actions by the government that was felt then is still seems to be happening now. I have read other books written about the city of Los Angeles during the years before and this book helps me understand the people who lived there better."
1,WTF is this?,"A friend of mine actually gave this CD to me, thinking I would like it, since I am somewhat of an amateur musician. He mistakenly bought it, thinking it was the original mp soundtrack from ""LotR: The Fellowship of the Ring"", but boy was he wrong! Honestly, I'm not sure how to describe the ""music"" on the cd, but after about 2 minutes of listening to the first few tracks, I had to shut it off, fearing I was about to suffer a fatal brain hemorrhage. From the anti-melodius tunes, to the unbearably awful intonation of the group, everything that could go wrong, did. DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT mistake this CD for Howard Shore's wonderful original score...."
4,Kids adore it!,My kids love to interact with Dora. Both my one year old and 3 year old learn with this show.
2,Attractive but not accurate,"The Galileo Thermometer is a both a beautiful piece of artwork and a functional scientific instrument. The thermometer operates on the principle that the buoyancy of liquid decreases as it warms and expands, allowing the weighted glass spheres to descend one at a time.The thermometer looked impressive when I first took it out of the box, but my excitement turned to disappointment when I tested it over the full temperature range. Several of the spheres are either severely miscalibrated or put into the tube in entirely the wrong order. This causes them to stick together and jam the tube. If you want to buy a poorly calibrated Galileo Thermometer, you can find one that is much smaller and much cheaper."
3,drowning in Darien,"I attended this show at Darien, a night of mud, coldness, and torrential down pours (Should I even say flooding...). Phish tried their damndest to keep us in high spirits. With the weather slipping into the 50 degree mark, wind, and rain, rain, rain- the audience was feeling a little under (those in the lawn). The second set opened with Drowned, which was wholly appropriate. I gave this show a three star rating and you may ask why.... Well, considering the circumstances of the show, we wanted a little zest to keep our booties warm, but the sounds of mellow saturated the evening. The cover Crosseyed and Painless blessed the song line up..and of course, did not let me down. Also heading the song list, Loving Cup, Suzy Greenburg, Punch You in the Eye, and Prince Caspian. Overall a wonderful show, but the weather appeared to dampen many of our spirits!"
1,What? They charge money for this?,"This book is nothing but a sales promotion piece that wants you to contact National Instrument Alliance members to do this sort of work for you. They were giving this book away free of charge at a Labview seminar. There is very little useful information here. It may give you some ideas, but there are no examples or instructions on how to do any of the projects mentioned. Sorry, don't waste your money."
1,Expensive sales brochure.,"To add to the comments above- on the back of this book it states that it includes code. This is blatantly not true- there is no code. There is no CD. There is no pointer to a URL where the code can be obtained...The back also claims the book contains ""detailled"" explanations of how the problems in each case study were tackled. Bull. Calling phrases like ""An algorythm was designed"" detailed is working in a rather odd version of English. A beta perhaps.Don't buy this book, it's pointless. The paper's too smooth to even employ as emergency bog roll."
3,Billington saves it,"Culled from the Jilly Cooper novel of the same name, ""The Man Who Made Husbands Jealous"" left me wanting to read the book again -- it's far better. Although Stephen Billington is a perfect choice as Lysander, I suppose it's just impossible to condense 700 or so pages into 3 ""episodes"" as this video does and maintain a true sense of the original story. There was obviously a lot cut out, both in terms of scenes and characters, from the book. Most irritatingly, Lysander is now a tennis pro instead of the polo-playing, basically career-less individual he is in the novel. I can't imagine enjoying this film if you aren't a huge Jilly Cooper fan -- I would find it very confusing had I not read the book first."
3,drop zone dvd movie,Love the action that Wesley delves out in this flick. Love the great copy I received.Beats the standard definition I first saw it in. Thanks seller.
1,People actually LIKE this movie?,"Well for a weak plot, and inferior effects, I guess it's ok. Who am I kidding!? This movie was not good at all! Snipes has done much, MUCH better than this, although it wasn't all his fault. I believe the most entertaining part was with the photocopier, and if I had to pick one outstanding pathetic part, it would be the chick saving Snipes' rear end, without safety gear. (By the way, physics determines that little flying upwards stunt utterly impossible) Why one star? Because I had to put something! Anyway, if you liked this movie, all the power to you, but I did not find it that great."
4,Cowboys Vs. Dinosaurs,"Pretty good sci-fi with some of the best Harryhausen effects i have seen. James Franciscus and Richard Carlson of ""It Came From Outerspace"" fame, team up to capture Gwangi, a T-Rex from a secret valley. Good to see this movie released to DVD. Great site and sound in wide screen format."
4,Cowboys and dinosaurs. Need I say more?,"A terrific minor classic, Valley of Gwangi holds up remarkably well today. Like King Kong, the original Godzilla, and Clash of the Titans, it's a fun film that has stood the test of time.The special effects are solid. I love CGI monsters, but the stop-motion dinos are top-notch and really cool to watch. The scene where our heroes rope and wrangle a dinosaur is still great fun. This film deserves a place on any monster movie fans shelf.One question though. Were there really such a thing as Mexican Gypsies? Seriously. I'd really like to know."
5,Harryhausen's neglected gem shines!,"This 1969 release by Ray Harryhausen and Charles Schneer was a flop upon it's initial release. A change of studio heads at Warner Bros. caused the film to be ignored in terms of advertising and publicity. Now you can see it in all it's glory. Widescreen, digitally remastered, with a documentary featuring praise by the ILM team. The stop motion animation is superb. Over the years, the film has gained a cult following due to video and cable. It's strange mix of cowboys and dinosaurs (with a stronger emphasis on the dinosaurs) is charming, and the film can be viewed by all ages. A must for Harryhausen fans, even if you own the video"
4,"Good, but display a little odd","I bought this clock a few months ago. I really like the dual alarm, how the alarms are set (with knobs instead of holding slippery buttons), and the ease of seeing what time the alarm is set for. I bought it to replace a 15 yr old Dream Machine that still worked fine, but had an annoying hum. The only downside is the display is really bright, so if you like a totally dark room, this would not be for you. Also, the numbers can be hard to read in the dark if you're not viewing the clock from a perfect angle. There are low/high brightness settings, but they both have their drawbacks. The radio is fine, nothing special. Overall I like it, and am glad to be rid of that humming!"
1,Beware this Sony,We had a Sony for many years that was called by this name that we got at a yard sale for a few bucks.We really liked it so when it finally died we bought this one that looks like the old one and is named the same thing by Sony.Well this is a piece of China junk.The numbers are small and practically unseeable due to there not being enough contrast.The light covers over the numbers.You also must be looking at it dead on to see anything.Also the alarm is very low without any adjustment.We now have to get up by the music side because that is adjustable.?.? One thing we did like about this is that it has a his and hers alarms that turn red so we can easily see if they are turned on.I would guess there are much better ones out there that have these features.The first one wore like iron...I can only hope this dies a quick death......Sony should know better or maybe like so many other companies they'll just get by on their name for a while.
2,Weekend Mode is Misleading,"Note that this clock does not know when the weekend is. To shift it over to the weekend alarms (set later so you can sleep in), you need to press a button on the top of the unit that says Weekend. And then press it again once the weekend is over. I.e., if you forget to press it on Sunday night to tell the unit that the Weekend is over, then you will be late for work on Monday while the clock continues to believe it is the weekend. Not a good design, and since even a cheap watch knows what day it is, it is not as if too much is being asked of Sony."
3,Brighter than I thought,This alarm clock works great and having two alarms is nice but even on the low brightness setting it is really bright! I was hoping for something that didn't cast a hard glow but unfortunately this does. Setting it down on it's face to hide the glow can turn off the alarm because the on/off buttons are on its face!
4,"Close but not quite, the value is unbeatable though.","So I pondered an alarm clock purchase for quite awhile, as many others have. I was looking for something with very conspicuous alarm ""on"" indication, a radio option for alarm and of course battery back-up.This little clock delivers ALMOST 5 stars:Pros: Two visibly active, individually adjustable alarms. Great radio reception. VERY easy to use controls. Small.Cons: Display only has two brightness levels, BRIGHT and ""less"" bright (though I must point out that I can be vampire like in my sleeping quarters, the darker the better). LCD display washes out when not viewed directly, this affects anyone putting this clock above or below the plane of their bed or wherever. Tiny lithium ""backup"" battery, though easy to find at a drug store, not quite the same as a AA or 9V.For the price, this clock cannot be beat. My cons are somewhat trivial but if they were fixed this clock would be PERFECT!"
5,I really love this alarm clock!,"My wife bought one of these several years ago and I was envious. It is amazingly easy to set, offers either radio alarm or tune or buzzer, automatically sets the time (preset at factory and battery backed), and has logically arranged buttons. Very easy to see which alarms are set and what time they are set to."
1,I couldn't get through it...,"I don't think that the protagonist of a novel has to be sweetness and light all the time-I can accept flawed characters, even seriously flawed characters. Philippa, however, was such a thoroughly unlikeable and despicable character that I honestly did not care what happened to her and actually found myself wishing that something bad would happen to her. She was selfish,cold, ungrateful, cruel to her adoptive parents, and I just could not continue reading. I generally like P.D James, but I did not like this book at all."
1,What were the people who liked this movie smoking?,"Worst. Performances. Ever. (I am including the various school plays my children performed in. In fact, there is many a six-year old Turnip in ""Mr. Farmer's Garden"" who could have taught Audrey Totter a thing or two about natural human behavior.)And the subjective camera? It could not have been less effective. For one (and only one . . the list of why it didn't work is much longer) thing, the angles were all much too narrow; the actual human eye sees about 15 feet more to each periphery than the ""subjective"" camera, which means that we didn't see anything like what ""Marlowe"" saw, unless he had a serious vision disorder.The only difference in quality between this and ""PLan 9 from Outerspace"" is the amount of money this cost."
5,VERY UPLIFTING SONGS,ENDURANCE IS A GREAT TRADITIONAL GOSPEL GROUP .BRINGING TO THE FOREFRONT SOME VERY UPLIFTING SONGS OF ENCOURAGEMENT IN THESE TOUGH ECONOMIC TIMES.
2,too general to be useful,"The advice on interviewing is very general and can be found to the same detail with google. The advice is all useful, but it's not worth the price and the style is a little goofy for what I expected to be a more professional book.The technical interview questions are atrocious. As others have commented, the ""easy"" questions are useful (e.g. how do you indicate comments?) and some of the solutions to the ""hard"" questions are incorrect (e.g. they try to illustrate a common C pointer bug in correctly written code).The book just lacks content."
4,Nice to have book - If you need quick questions on C++ and Oracle,"This book certainly helps managers interviewing programmers who claim expertise with many languages. If you own a J2EE shop and looking for Oracle and C++ expertise and need tough questions to ask....the questions prescribed in this book is good. Also note, this book does'nt help you as a reference for any other practical use of those languages."
3,The Shaolin Warriors,not too bad. some good action. almost like most other story relating to Shaolin action movies.
3,Coulda. Shoulda. Woulda.,"Coulda been a lot scarier. Seriously, not that many movies have a ghost like this one.If they had played up her gruesome appearance more, it might have produced somegood scares.Shoulda been more dramatic. The matriarch's dark secret is truly heinous, andwould've given the movie a more powerful jolt of drama. Instead, it takes a backseatto the (sic) ghost story.Woulda been a better movie, had it decided what itwanted to be: drama, horror or suspense."
2,TOO MUCH SEASONING!,"These soy crips are too strong!!!!!!!! The texture, smell, and crunch are good, but flavor is strong. The one's with less seasoning, and there are some, are good! Only buy these if you LOVE salty snacks and the other flavors. The upside, you can't eat a lot. I'd change this to 3 stars, but it won't let me. Gave these away, with mixed reviews. Some people LOVE them, others feel the same as I do."
4,great way to start the 20+album series,"this was my second live phish album (no. 10 was my first) and it's an overall solid show. although i do enjoy the shows from 93 that ""crazy phans"" wished still occurred, to me the phish sound was so much more refined in later 94 and in 95. the dissonant jamming and stuff is still there, but a lot of the playing between band members is much tighter. my personal favorites on this album are a great take on the curtain, tweezer>timber>tweezer because its ultra funky and bluesy, and another classic set of segued tunes in halley's comet>nicu>slave to the traffic light...all songs i don't really find on other tapes that i have. in the first set there's a nice tela and an energetic frankenstein. i wouldn't reccomend this as an introduction to live phish (no. 10 might be more friendly) but it certainly has some tight playing on it. i'd give it 4.5 if i could."
5,A Dream come True,"This is the best series of Live releases along with the Dick's Picks Series the Dead started in 1993. Who says a dream can't come true. For less than a price of a concert ticket to a Phish show you can purchase an entire show and have it forever on unbeliveable digital quality. The sound is so good on these discs if you closed your eyes while listening you'd swear you were there. For any true phan these discs are a must have and for anyone who was ever interested in what Phish was all about buy these discs. Phish is 100 times better ""live"" than in the studio and these discs prove it. You can purchase one volumne of this series for less than $... per disc. This is excactly what us phans want to hear. The boyz sound tighter than ever on these releases and it only makes us phans hope that the Hiatus is almost over! The music on these discs is as raw as ever! You won't be sorry! Peace!"
2,Spiderman flop,"The toy looks good, is easy to assemble and seems to be holding up well. The hitch is that lil kids have trouble hitting the targets so quickly lose interest in it. It's just not that much fun."
4,You're The One That I Want!,"Finally it is revealed what colleges everyone got into and which ones they didn't also certain people on a waiting list for some schools.This one is defenitely the best book of the series besides the first, I highly recommend this one! Blair's sister little sister, name Yale, choosen by her, is finally born!If you like Aaron hes not really in the picture that much.Jenny is now in the picture a lot in this book, with some new modeling she and Serena have been seen at a lot of places with each other and even photoshoots!I'm not going to spoil anything else so enjoy!"
4,Sooooooooo not gonna happen!,"The events in this book made me wanna tear my hair out! I mean--- the only good thing about Blair is that she is a good student. But she really doesn't get into any colleges! That Serena girl, who already has everything, gets into every college too! This is soooo unfair to Blair, don't you agree? I wonder why Blair didn't get in anywhere. And why Serena gets in everywhere. This makes me think that Serena is GOSSIP GIRL since she could've wrote her admissions essay and said that she did this Gossip Girl website and that's a pretty cool thing so the colleges let her in. But really-- will Blair and Yale ever be resolved. And what about Blair and Nate? I don't see them happily ever after cuz of Blair's insecurities and controlling behavior. But I would be crushed if Blair lost her virginity only to be dumped by Nate again. That will be tooo cruel on the girl who tries really hard but gets into nowhere for college and whose family life is so messed up."
3,Cecily von Ziegesar screwed up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Um..................hellllooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!! It is so impossible that a girl with all AP classes, ranks #1 in every single class for 4-years in a row, has a gazillion extracurriculars, has nearly a perfect SAT score, and nearly prepared for this all her life not getting into Harvard or Yale . But you would put a girl who only has one extracurricular, screws up with the SAT, and parties all night would get into Harvard or Yale. The author has gone completely stupid doing this. Harvard and Yale are few of the top 10 schools and some stupid girl with a score of like a 600 would get in. Note to Cecily von Ziegesar: You have turned an idiot by screweing up the 6th book with such an unrealistic plot!"
5,Excellent with few flaws,"I LOVE Gossip Girl and this one was probably one of the best, but it seems to only be a good story line about 2 or 3 main characters. Blair and Nate were awsome in this book but Serena, Jenny, and Aaron (who are also my favorite characters) had boring experiences throughout the book. Vanessa and Dan are constantly breaking up and getting back together and complaining, so they can be cut off in my opinion, but instead they get a MUCH bigger role then Aaron, Blair's brother, who is an awsome character. Aaron maybe has 4 lines in the hole book! Gossip girl rocks but I want all the characters to rock as well, and to find out who gossip girl is!"
1,Thank God for MGM Version!,"I knew the book was vastly different from the beloved MGM film, so I was prepared for it not to be your mother's Wizard of Oz. But my goodness! The level of violence was really surprising! It seemed the Tin Woodman's only role was to hack things (primarily animals) to pieces. NOT for the faint-hearted/animal lover, and definitely NOT for children. In addition, there was simply no character development, nothing that made me really care, unlike the film. It is only 130+ pages, so if you merely want to compare it to the film, it's worth the time--especially if you get a free version--but if you are looking for anything like the film, reader beware!"
4,A classic of the world,"This is Tolstoy's longest work, but is very readable. In fact, the book should be quite accessible to high schoolers, although it helps to know a little 18th and 19th century European history. There are plenty of summaries here, so I won't waste time with that. Tolstoy makes the mistake of including too many main characters, which is the largest contributing factor to the length. There are essentially six main characters, one of these being the war. Tolstoy must divert attention to too many places and hence War and Peace is more dilluted than Anna Karennina. Anna is a better book and I would recommend that to be read before War and Peace."
1,A book that every Goju Blackbelt should know ....,"This is a book that I show to all my blackbelts, a must read book. This is a book I show them of what ""not to do"". I am sure if you are a traditional Goju Ryu, you will find the basics and katas are full of mistakes and faults. I used this book to ask my students taking blackbelt test of ""Tell me what is wrong with this Sanchin Kata""? The very fundamental concept of elbow never leaves the body is not even followed. Looking at the Sanchin kata, as a Goju practitioner, I am embarrassed. Don't waste your money on this book, or the second volume. Spend it on a solid Goju Master like Morio Higaonna instead. If you learn your form from this book, you are NOT learning Goju."
1,What's the point?,"The originals are superior in every way:production, musicianship and arrangement. Just get the You Only Live Twice and On Her Majesty's Secret Service soundtracks instead."
4,Knitting Factory,"I saw Sex Mob with Medeski at the Knitting Factory in NYC back around 2000 and they played nothing but Bond songs. It was not what I expected walking in but it was an absolutely fantastic show. If this disc is anyhting like the live show, you will be more than satisfied buying the albumn."
4,Great work,It's not a surprise to me but Bennato released another great cd. More electric than acoustic guitar and good lyrics. If you like him get this one.
5,The epitome of hard-boiled,"I've been a fan of Hammet for quite some time and I really like the Thin Man and the Maltese Falcon but my favorite of his is the Continental Op. Here we have a hero whose name we are never told! He is the epitome of hard-boiled, a man who can dish it out as well as he can take it.The Big Knockover is a nice collection of ten perfect short stories. The first, The Gutting of Couffignal, is the story of a small village under seige and has a neat twist. Fly Paper will keep you guessing."
1,its not a slip cover!,"u r surprized to see its not a slip cover, yes its not.wrong title, the product pkg title says its a furniture throw.If u need a long throw then this is for you. I liked the quality for the price though. If u r looking for a slip cover then stop donot buy this."
1,Another Rip-Off,"This is no slip cover but a square piece of cloth. If it had holes, it would be a shower curtain. It runs small as the one I bought hardly covered the piece.I had been watching this item for a while before buying it. The ""sale"" price seems to be the only price."
5,Perfect,"The Virgin's Encyclopedia of Popular Music rated this one of the few in the book to be rated five stars (maximum quotation). And it is esay to know why. IT's perfect, it has variety of sounds, it is well produced (even being recorded in 1975) and shows why Springsteen is so good."
3,Loud and proud,"3 1/2Nearly as big and bold sounding as the distinguished pedigree would suggest, yet in all its rugged glory, somehow falls short of intended power for me, as Springsteen howls through a few brilliantly transcending, but some musically similar ideas in an overall semi-contrived, but potently rawer approach."
5,Bruce Springsteen at his best,"Born to Run is the album that started Bruce Springsteen to the fame he enjoys now.The album has a raw charm, but it is a kick back to the Rock of the 50's and 60's.Bruce at one time wanted to become a premier guitarist but realized his efforts were in vain. He decided to concentrate on writing and performing instead. In time he has become one of the very best writers in Rock.This is his signature album (arguably with Born in the USA).If you like Bruce Springsteen this album is a must."
3,Holy Cow warning!!,"I think ""Born to run"" is a very over rated album. I own every Springsteen record and I believe ""Born in the USA"" together with ""Tunnel of love"" is his best work.On this recording there's actually just two or three songs that are top class, namely ""Thunder road"", ""Jungleland"" and maybe ""Born to run"". The rest is not that exciting, at least not for me. Somehow, this album have achieved cult status, and almost no one question the actual quality - ""you got to praise this one if you consider yourself a Springsteen fan"". Please, listen and make up your own mind."
2,Good,If you are an old fart. This guy is so over rated. Maybe Im listening to a different thing but this guy's voice is horrible. My dad is obsesed with him and has this album signed but who would want that. This guy is a thing of a past and now He thinks he is such a big rebl because he hate pre. BUsh but this guy is a fake. He sucks at singing sucks at guitar and at drums. His only talent which is why I gave it 2 stars is because of his lyrics but still this album is boring and just gets old after a while. Im probabbly not going to change anyones mide into not buying this sobecause the media made this such a big hype but this is just not my kind of CD
4,A Practical Guide to Developing A Security Program,"With my corporation having worked with Ernst & Young's Security & Technology Solutions group over the years, my colleagues and I have come to respect them as among the most practical and knowledgeable security professionals in the field of IT security. Defending the Digital Frontier nicely reflects E&Y;'s experience and practices, providing easy-to-understand concepts and insights involving the implementation of a realistic security program.My only wish is that the book provided more case examples of actual corporate security incidents, including a description of the financial losses and other impacts experienced by the victimized company, plus how the event was handled (both right and wrong). Such ""lessons learned"" should be more widely communicated. Having companies as well as firms like E&Y; share their security incident experiences would contribute greatly to improving our ability to properly respond to security threats."
2,This album surprisingly....SUCKS,"I absolutely loved RADIANCE, and picked up the latest album the morning it came out. I figured after three years they would have come up with something pretty rocking. As it turns out this is the most bland album I have ever heard. There is not a single song I wanted to listen to again aside from the radio-release ""Comfort.""Gone is the rock-edge of their previous effort, and it has been overtaken by constant bluthering of the lead singer's voice, which gets old. Also, the lyrics on this album need some serious work.All in all, a very disappointing effort from a band that desperately needed a good album to get them recognition."
4,Awesome Price,Got this album on an Amazon Deal. It is a great collection of Collective Soul Music. I enjoy the Greatest Hits since they don't contain all the filler music.
1,very useless,I sprayed 5 kids all over and it was empty! It is good but not for this much money! I would recommend if it was cheap
4,4 out of 5,"nowhere near the first one ""eagle has landed"", but still not bad especially for being a sequal to such a phenomenal book."
1,This dumbkuff of a whopper should fall off a gondola and drown,"Is it me or is Madonut, the dumbkuff whopper from Italy who defected to Enga...the UK, trapped in 1979. Disco is dead and Sorry may be huge in the UK but in America it FLOPPED big time! Save your pennies and wait for the new Iron Maiden album!"
4,Chevy Vortec Wheel Cover,"Great Product, Protects the Steering Wheel finish, took some getting used to, I like the feel. Easy to install, just make sure you have it lined up before you put it on."
4,Illustrated and Indexed Peek into Pastimes of Colonial America,"What did people do before Roku and PST's? This 182-page book (including the index) provides narrative and illustrations for games and activities of colonial Virginia in four categories: 1) home entertainments, 2) games, 3) sports and outdoor games, 4) public events (including executions). It is an excellent reference on this topic, with 8 pages of bibliography."
1,Oh mercy please!,Even the most die hard Chuck fans could not have helped being majorly disappointed by this all time low from Cannon. The pic starts pleasingly enough and even hints at some vague form of a budget but before long we're in Israel (cheaper to film there) and then it all falls apart.We could forgive the crappy 70's Chuck films because of the superior fight scenes but these are not in evidence in this effort that deserves never to be seen again.
2,I was laughing the whole time,"I'll try not to waste too much time writing this review as I did watching this movie, but if you expect to be scared or thrilled, you won't be. It's much too silly due to the insanely bad acting, ridiculous music and Chuck's very annoying street sidekick.The demon was well over the top, especially with the weird-looking eyes. The only thing I can remember him by are his long nails, which look like goat hooves and are rather nasty.But if you want to see Chuck Norris kick some a** - even if it doesn't work too well on a demon that never injures - then watch it."
3,THE TERROR ISNT OVER!!!,When a corruted asylum docter becomes obsessed with studying the deadly secreats of hell the worst is yet to come. The docter goes deep under the sanatarium where the vilelest most horrible patiennts are kept and takes them to be fed to an evil demon to give her life once again! However towards the middle of the movie the the corrupted doctor gets more then he bargans for from the demon and the lord of the underworld which ends with terrifying results.Also prepare for the return of PINHEAD and the rest of the hidious cynobytes as theycome for more flesh journey into hell in this sequal of horror!!
5,haunting to say the least,this is my first jane campion movie and of course i was incredibly impressed. absolutely no punches are pulled in this one. and it has incredible cinematography that makes it seem like a dream and in some cases a nightmare. the scenes inside the insane asylum are unforgettable as is Fox's performance. get this one. you'll feel as all of this is taking place right in front of you.
5,Great reminder of the excellence of birdhouse,"As a skate video alone, I would most likely give the end 5 stars, but the dvd clearly takes it to that great level. The video itself interweaves individual skaters' footage with more humorous introductions (some very short, some just as long as the footage itself). When you talk with your friends about the video, you'll probably mention Andrew Reynolds' beer-drinking monkey or Heath and Jeremy's disastrous van ride, but I think what makes it great (and what should make it great) is the skating itself. The skits can get old over time and will lose their novelty but the skating is ground-breaking enough to stay with you. In addition, the dvd really includes a ton of extra material (I especially enjoyed the extra footage with each skater's bio and had a laugh at the chaotic team commentary) that clearly makes this an excellent purchase."
3,Good Stuff,"Guess I'm loyal to CKYK but this was pretty cool. I especially liked the ""making of..."" section where you see the difficulty of the moves and the number of bails and falls before they nail the trick. The van running stuff over was funny as s&%t (EXCEPT FOR RUNNING OVER TREES- EARTH TO DUMB GUY: TREES AND PLANTS CONVERT SUNLIGHT AND WATER TO OXYGEN- YOU NEED OXYGEN TO BREATHE). TH is unreal. Good soundtrack. Was hoping to see more of Bucky."
5,Classy and Elegant Watch,"If you are looking for an elegant, serious, durable, and all-terrain watch, this is the one. It looks on my wrist exactly how I saw it in pictures, here at amazon.Nice watch, very classy and elegant."
1,Wrong sample songs for the CD being sold,These listen to sample songs do not match the CD that is being sold. You will receive a CD with 8 songs and all orchestra.
4,Good information - realistic programs,"I bought this book along with the 21 day detox by Roni DeLuz. Both methods work, Dr. Roni's gets the most weight loss, but I think Dr. Haas's book is more comprehensive. It gives information on total body detox, and also provides specific detoxes for those who want to focus on a particular substance (alcohol, sugar and caffeine are examples). I find the food combining priciples and the recipes easier to adopt. I would recommend it - its a good reference and instruction manual for detox and clean, healthy eating."
4,They've come a long way,"From their brattish and DIY beginnings to modern day, The Donnas have definitely come full circle on their new release SPEND THE NIGHT. Still epousing the same ""Cute boys, we want to fool around with you after the show, if you're man enough"" lyrical themes, the band has got some big time producers behind the boards and the proper attention is finally paid to creating vocal and guitar melodies that hit home. Donna A's vocals are still delivered with attitude and lust, this time with more tone and not as indifferently meowed on their previous releases. This is the album I have been waiting for them to make every since I got into them, and you will not be disappointed.Favorite tracks""I Don't Care""""Who Invited You""""Take It Off""""You've Got A Date Tonigth"""
1,Awful!,this album is REALLY bad. all the songs sound exactly the same and and it would be a disgrace to actual rock musicians to call this stuff rock.
1,OUCH,"I bought a couple of The Donnas CDs and I deeply regret it. The musicianship is incredibly poor and the vocals are the same on each song and on each CD: monotone. It's almost like the singer is reading the lyrics. I guess I'm spoiled, having been exposed to women with true vocal ability; women that front bands like Elis, Dreamside, The Cranberries, Concrete Blonde. As a female singer/musician myself it is painful to listen to this band. I hoped their musicianship and vocal stamina/range would improve or evolve from one CD to the next but sadly I was disappointed. Their music is devoid of riffs and hooks. Even for ""punk"" the delivery is high school level at best. If you want good punk or alt, buy Hole's CDs. (Courtney can at least play and sing.)It makes me sad because with a little effort, The Donnas could probably evolve into a great all girl band. IF THEY WANTED TO. I'll keep my fingers crossed and hope for the best."
1,Boring,This is nothing but a rip of 80's rock. If anyone compares them to the Ramones or punk they need to be slapped. But if you must listen to stuff like this buy Betty Blowtorch instead.
4,Still love the Donnas,"For 4 years, I've been waiting for the day I'd see a Donnas video playing on MTV. The first time I saw ""Take It Off"" I couldn't believe it. I ran out and bought Spend the Night and listened to it nonstop for about a week. I'm still listening to it, and I'm still not bored with it. The Donnas, plainly put, rock. They're the best girl rock band of our time, and they certainly are better the most guys out there. From Donna R.'s mind-blowing guitar solos to Donna A.'s belting voice, I was not let down at all."
4,pure rock that really rolls,"the donnas, to me, are equivalent to the ramones for the next generation. they crank out pure power genuine rock and roll with a melodic edge. it is straight ahead rock complete with roaring guitars and solid drums all wrapped around a punk pop edge that really delivers something new and exciting with a sassy attitude, unseen in a long time."
3,An OK Album..,"I liked some of the songs, but I LOVED the last album better.. Currently I have bought ""SHUT UP"" by Kelly Osbourne (A GREAT ALBUM!!) and it had a whole bunch of catchy hits, with a great tune.. You wont be disapointed..."
4,Totally rad!,"The Donna's new cd, Spend The Night, is by far the best cd brought to you by this band. The Donnna's have grown up, and their musical talent and lyrics have too. A true chick punk fan will want to get this one!"
4,They rock!,"I would say ""The Donnas"" deserve their new found success. They've been rockin' for years now and have steadily gotten better. This, their major label debut, is worth the hype. Though no new ground is broken, this is good and catchy pop/punk, with alot of 'tude. Their bad girl lyrics and good looks don't hurt either. The only drawback, is that the songs all sound the same. But since they all sound good, I guess that's ok. They might just be the rockinest all-girl band around. Oh wait, that's ""L7""."
2,more lame pop-rock crap,remember joan jett? remember the go go's well these are the new girls in town who think they're doing something new and creative but not really doing nothing but following trends from 30 years ago the best rock group is Parliament-Funkadelic hands down.
1,Read My Review!,"I bought this CD with high expectations. I like music that is created my females, because I myself am a girl. I also liked ""Take It Off"" when I heard it on the radio. My expectations were not met by a mile. I don't understand why everyone is giving this CD five stars. Sure, the Donnas are nice people and its cool that they're playing rock music. But are you listening to this album? Every single song sounds exactly the same! All of the guitar solos are predictable and boring. And the lyrics are god awful. If you want to listen to some good girl music try: Sleater Kinney, Jewel, Michelle Branch, Fiona Apple, or Sheryl Crow. This isn't worth more than one listen."
1,This movie SUCKED AZZ~!,"I cannot believe that I wasted 3.99 renting this movie. This is the perfect example of judging a book by its cover. It put me in the mind of one of those low budget porno's with their acting technique. It made me think of them learning their lines right before the part. It was really horrible. I am so angry I wasted my money, the hour and a half watching it, (which I felt like doing dishes in the middle of it), and wasting my eyes, and ears on such crap. My eyes are still bleeding from watching this HORRIBLE movie. I feel like asking for a refund. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS MOVIE~!!!!!"

4,Generally good game,"A great game that was groundbreaking at the time. Unfortunately few play this game online anymore. However, from a historical perspective regarding the cold war, I couldn't have bought a game that had more meaning to me than this. No longer being an expensive collectors edition, it comes with a piece of the berlin wall, and a documentary from the history channel. You'll want the soviet assault expansion as well. They really drove it home with this game."
2,WARNING,"Beware! This product REQUIRES the use of a PS2 port. If you have a USB only desktop or laptop, you WILL be returning this."
5,a wonderful resource for hope and healing,"I read Michele Germain's book almost three years after my divorce. Although I had made major strides in healing, events would trigger lapses into sorrow.While Ms. Germain's personal history made her a kindred spirit, she also educates the reader on the grieving process, makes the text come alive with biographies, and gives concrete steps for healing. Her gentle guidance and nurturing spirit is felt throughout.I highly recommend her book no-matter where one is on the journey post divorce or major loss."
1,Not even worth the attempt!,"I took a look at the photo and the other individuals review and though, ""what a great deal!"" Boy was I wrong. It arrived with 2 broken glasses and was missing the ladle and serving tray. I took it back to my local Target store and they did refund my money, but not my shipping costs. How is that acceptable?"

4,Works like it should,"It fits and works like it should, I purchased in-channel ones previously, but they quickly broke, so I went with this.. and they work fine."
2,White Trays Disappointed,"In spite of its great review in Real Simple Magazine, I was disappointed in White Trays. They were very difficult to keep in place on both the upper and lower teeth, so I'm sure my teeth didn't get as white as promised. There was some improvement, but probably not enough to try them again"
2,Crest White Strips are much better,"It's like a giant step backwards. The ""trays"" are like primitive white strips. They are just awkward.They do whiten very well, quicker and faster than the white strips in my opinion. But, the negatives are pretty big. The gel expands or something and really burns my throat and makes me nauseated. I'll finish out my pack, but never buy again."
1,Awful product!,"I read all the reviews, good and bad. And decided to try the product anyway. The negetive reviews were right. This product is awful! The trays are cheap paper type material,they do not stay on and the gel burns your gums. I took them out after 5 mins and my teeth felt sensitive already. I am taking these back tomorrow.Going to try Crest Whitestrips next."
1,aquafresh white trays,This product was difficult to use as it did not want to stay on your teeth. The gel was also hard to spread around on your teeth. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
1,Not worth the money,What a pain to use - and a complete waste of money. I thought the trays were terrible - they didn't fit my teeth and then kept falling off. I ended up using my own night guards to see if this worked better - the solution burned my gums and really made my teeth sensitive. I finally quit after 4 nights. I truly would not recommend this product.
1,Not Good....,"So, I used these last week and I still have strange white spots on my teeth. The product package says that it is temporary and will go away with continued use, but I've used the 7 days worth and waited a couple days and the spots are still there. I also did not like the way my gums felt afterward. They were sore and one time the white tray bleached them and my gums were burning. It was quite painful, actually. I would not recommend these. I think my teeth may be a tiny bit whiter, but not worth the $30.00, the pain, or the trouble, especially if these white spots stay on my teeth!"
1,OUCH! Cracked my tooth???,"I just used the trays for the first time and at about 15 minutes I had such a sharp pain happen that I spit out the trays (and the gross gel) into my hands and had to go rinse my mouth out.Upon checking my teeth to see what happened I noticed a BIG crack running down the entirety of my front left tooth. It doesn't really hurt anymore and it doesn't feel like it's on the surface, but it wasn't there before I used this.You can bet that I'm calling the company on monday and that I'm going to go get this checked out by a dentist."
2,Don't spend the money,"This product does not whiten like I expected and the trays are awkward and not maliable enough to conform correctly to your teeth. Also, the gel doesn't hit every spot so the tops of my teeth aren't the same color as the base. And when you're done with it it leaves big chunks of gel in your mouth that made me gag. I also had to search all over for how long to leave them in...it's not on the instruction insert but on the box in tiny little letters.Instead of these go with Crest Professional Whitestrips. You can't get them in stores--I could only find them online."
2,So sad.....,"I really, I mean REALLY, wanted to like these. I love the concept, but the trays are very flimsy and don't make anything like a ""custom"" fit. A lot of the product came out from the back and the sides. I just got too grossed out thinking of what I was swallowing! I gave it two stars though, because the gel did whiten pretty well."
1,Just awful!,"I bought this product because, in comparison to most whitening products, it seemed relatively quick and easy. I sincerely regret my purchase. The trays do not fit properly. They try to flop around in your mouth, the gel comes out and it does not taste that great. The worst part is that this product ""burned"" my gums and gave me terrible teeth sensitivity - which I have never had prior to using this product. The product does whiten. However, I have a very tiny mouth and the product only whitened half of each tooth! It looks ridiculous. I plan on going to the dentist and getting professional whitening."
1,Terrible design that won't stay on your teeth,"This product is poorly designed. The trays are flimsy such that they generally will not stay in place. The gel is meant to be pushed against your teeth so that the trays and gel will always cover the surface of your teeth, but this mechanism does not work. The gel is not adhesive enough to stay in place. You will often find clumps of it come out the edges, forcing you to either swallow it or risk losing the entire tray when trying to spit the gel out. Perhaps the intensity of the gel would work better than that of competitor's white strips, but since the gel rarely stays on, it's impossible to tell. I will go back to strips and stay away from these trays. It was a true waste of money and I regret having tried what I thought would be more like a professional teeth-whitening kit."
4,great product,"This product is great. I noticed a difference with in 3 days. I have tried Crest White Strips as well, and thought this was a much better product. The trays stay on your teeth, and you can even have a conversation if you want to!. I highly recommend this product."
4,A Hit!!,"I remember reading this book over 20 years ago as a 12 year old in Southwest Georgia. I dreamed of the ""bright lights"" of the big city in which this story took place-but I could still relate to all of the ""coming of age"" as well as racial issues presented in the story. A great book, especially for young African American girls."
4,An uneven masterpiece,"There's something curious going on in this film. It's as if there's a fight going on between Chaplin the physical gag guy and Chaplin the great director. Particularly in the first part of the movie there are a lot of marginally funny gags that go on too long, almost as if Chaplin couldn't bear to let them go. These are especially noticeable in the scenes between the tramp and the eccentric millionaire. The other part of the story is much more dramatic and involves the blind flower seller, amazing played by Virginia Cherrill, who I think does the best job of playing a blind person I've ever seen. Finally at the end Chaplin the director wins out and the last scene is incredibly moving - one of the best recognition scenes in cinema. Ever. Watch it."
4,Better as romance than slapstick,"The Bottom Line:A serious film that's marred by some underwhelming scenes of slapstick (though to be honest the boxing scene is really pretty well done), City Lights deserve to be remembered for the wonderfully sweet scenes between the blind woman and the tramp, not the crazy hijinks that ensue for the other half of the film.3/4"
3,Basic Chess Endings,"Reuben Fine was a brilliant GM, but his book, Basic Chess Endings, is not basic. For someone of average tournament strength (USCF 1450) or below, this book serves only as a reference book. In that regard, Basic Chess Endings is impressive, but of extremely limited value.Beginners through average tournament grade are better off investing time in a more fundamental text, of which there are many. Lev Alburt's, Just the Facts, appears to be more appropriate for the vast majority of chess players. Scott gru-Bell USCF ID#12738508."
3,An Outdated Classic,"Fine's Basic Chess Endings was a landmark achievement. It is hard for those living in the computer age to appreciate what a monumental achievement this book was. One world caliber grandmaster collected the best analysis of endings available 60 years ago in one handbook. For many years, it was the only real comprehensive source for the ending. Almost immediately, analysts found flaws in Fine's analysis. Averbakh and the Informant team took five volumes to update Fine's work.With the advent of computers, our understanding is much greater. We now have better tools for the ending and more accurate books, such as Fundamental Chess Endings by Muller and Lamprecht. So, Basic Chess Endings is now museum piece."
1,"Reuben's Basic chess Endings sold by Tim Morris, Odessa, Mo.","The book sold to me by Tim Morris, of Odessa, Missouri, was foxxed, smelled of mildew and at one time two-thirds of its pages soaked in water.I purchased the book on master-card through Amazon. Amazon has refused to refund purchase money. Tim Morris has refused to return my phone calls.Needless to say, I'm angry about this purchase made possible by Amazon.Earl Hutchison"
2,Get the updated version of this book,"This book was written over the course of one summer. That, alone, is an incredible feat. But the book is not user friendly. It is written in encyclopedic form. It is written in descriptive (old style) notation. It is hard to follow the lines of notation, as little guidence is given to the reader if he is in the main variation or a subvariation.In order to squeeze in as many words as possible, the book is extremely dense in terms of presentation. There is hardly any blank space in the margins of this book. It's a forboding book to study from.That being said, it's an excellent book. However, McKay has republished this book recently (2004). The new edition is revised by GM Pal Benko, an authority on endgames. The notation is updated from descriptive to algebraic. The layout in the new book is not as dense as this book.So, no one should buy this book; thus the poor rating. Buy Benko's revision of this book."
2,Disappointed,"As a transplant to NJ I looked forward to this magazine every month to learn about my adopted state. It was a terrific guide to the state's history, current events, people, places to explore, etc.In recent years the magazine has become a guide to the best decorators, doctors, plastic surgeons, lawyers, trendy restaurants, expensing housing, etc. If I used to spend an hour or two reading each issue I now spend 15 minutes.I have need a subscriber for more than 10 years and now I may not renew -- Bob"
3,Get the leather one.....,"This cover is O.K. & has a good, rubber-feel sports grip.However, I ended up getting the leather one & it is muchnicer & more comfortable on the hands."
5,Very Good Book,"I find Mr. Deloria's writing to be very engaging. If you wish to learn more about Native American Culture and History you can do so with this book along with sharing in the emotional, psychological and spiritual foundation from which the the Native American people evolved."
4,Selleck a real drawback,For narration I give this DVD a 1. FOr visual effects 4 stars or 5. Selleck must be overlooked to enjoy this DVD. Really to bad. I don't understand how this bad voicing slipped thru.
3,OK but look for something else before buying,"This book is simply OK. As far as the subject of entrepreneurship, I would advise looking to see what else is out there. This book tends to get way too wordy at times and is not very user-friendly. I had to read it for an MBA class, but it's not a book I'll be keeping for reference."
1,"Argh, what a terrible book","As an honors student used to reading difficult books, let me assure you this book is not a good book.It is confusing to the average and above average student. Pity the below average student that has to read this book. Even my professor thought it was confusing.I would never use this book for self study. Find another book if you are interested in starting your own company. This one is confusing and has poor examples.A word to the wise, the case study accounting sheets are all messed up. They did not check their accounting softwware results and just stuck them in the book. As a result, there are tiems that should not be included on the income statements and the balance sheet is wrong.After spending 1 1/2 hours of class time trying to correct the accounting mistakes and discussing the lack of proper information in the business proposal, you won't like this book either."
2,Betta sunglasses....out of style,"Yes, these are a great buy, however, if you dont want to look like a throwback form the 70's/80's don't buy them.Good product overall, but I think I'll just use them for yard work when no one is around!"
4,The Betty Ford Center Book of Answers,This was eye opening. I am the family member of an alcoholic and this book tells the truth about addiction!
4,This is a great book to teach the SAT words.,"I am a student in 6th grade that is using this book in Spelling. This book is hard, but I am up for the challenge. It is a great book."
4,Good and Interesting,"This short CD is what happens when 3 very talented musicians spend a day screwing around in the studio. You get some flashes of brilliance and a lot of experimenting. All of the album is interesting except the last 3 minutes or so of the last track which is utterly pointless. The first track is great stuff and reminds me of prime Don Caballero. Over-all: good stuff and well worth a listen or two, but not something that lasts."
1,Not Pleased,"This can arrived with minor dents, and the metal joint on the side looked ugly, not finished well, too much space in between, something green got stuck in the joint,does not look the money's worth."
1,Where's the WIDESCREEN version???,"The one star is not because the movie is bad - in fact, I really want to buy it because I love this story; but, like others commenting here, I'm only investing in Widescreen versions when I spend my money (even if this one is only $10)."
3,Good film,"I'd prob give this film 3.5 stars if I could. It's a very good, old-fashioned kind of movie that combines sci-fi and an old-fashioned love story. All the actors are very good and it's really even quite an inspiring film."
5,Forever Young (Snap Case),Excellent DVD for the whole family and arrived on time in great shape. Would buy from this seller again.
4,very good movie,"This is a little spin on time travel (kind of). good story line and great acting. Would recommend this ""chick flick"" to anyone"
4,Refreshing for all ages,"This is truly a great family movie. The movie is a puesdo sci fi picture about cryogenics, a love story, a family story, a manly romanic story. I have watched this twice. I truely enjoyed the interaction between Jammie and Mel and the kids were great. I did not care about accuracy, or style, or contents, it was pure enjoyment."
3,di's review,It is a older movie but I feel one of the first to explore the subject of freezing people. It is not that modern now but is still a goodie for people who want to watch a classic wholesome family movie
1,wrong perfume,"I got the wrong perfume my order was ""Lancetti Perfume"" (yellow box) but I got ""leidi Lancetti"" (red box). i sent three e-mails and waited for more than 2 weeks and no one reply.just bad support."
4,The next best thing to being there,"Great DVD. Well mixed. Wish they identified their ""guest stars"" on-screen, as I didn't readily recognize a few of them.Worth purchasing"
3,The WHO for the MTV Generation,"As others have mentioned, the video images change every few seconds. This is not exciting but extremely annoying. Would have been so much better just to see the band play.The performance seemed ""safe and professional,"" pretty tame. The guests, other than violin player on 1 track, added nothing and were another distraction.I wouldn't want to watch this dvd again."
5,The ONLY new Christain Grunge album to come out in years,"One word can sum this album up: ""Breathtaking"". I'm serious. It seems that I'm pretty much caught up in the past when it comes to music, I'm really big into hair metal (Stryper, Van Halen) and grunge (early Pearl Jam, Soundgarden), so I rarely purchase new up-to-date music, BUT I gave GS Megaphone a try, and GOODNESS GRACIOUS ME!! This cd is incredible! While all the tracks are killer, the best are 'Venom', 'Reformation', and 'Sing Until The Song Sings You'. 'Sing Until The Song Sings You' has a real special place in my heart because of the use of the sitar (one of my favorite instruments) thoughout the entire song.If you looking for a great new grunge cd, CHECK THIS ONE OUT!!"
4,Had a bad day?,"I think we've all had days like this! Sure, our hero may have crossed the line a bit but I think we all secretly hope this guy is out there.Recommended for everyone who punches a clock."
3,A step better than okay,Douglas was great in this movie. But his character should have been better established at the beginning of the film.
2,Not so Good...,"I was so excited for Static-x to release another CD. I loved ""Wisconsin Death Trip"" and Thought their next CD could only be better. I was very disapointed after buying it. Wayne does not use his voice like he did in Death trip and it sounds more like a Death metal CD then a Static-x CD. The only song that I found to be remotly good is..""this is not"" but the rest of them just blow. I will always be a Static-x fan cuz I love Wayne but I will not support this new CD that they have let me and alot of other people down on."
3,OK,"This Cd is ok but it's not great.Their could be a few things better with this album,about half of the songs on the album are good but not great."
3,mediocre at best,"yeah, this CD just isn't that good. ""get to the gone"", ""machine"", and ""this is not"" are pretty cool, but the other stuff just doesn't really do it for me. wisconsin death trip is way better. I'm going to give the same advice i gave the people who read my review of welcome by taproot: downoad the songs i mentioned above, and just don't bother with the other stuff."
1,What happened?,"When I popped this in the cd player I thought that my mind was going to be blown even more than when I listened to Wisconsin Death Trip. This is one of the worst cds in my collection, I am incredibly dissapointed with the way Wayne uses his voice on this album compared to WDT. He sounds like he's trying to be a some kind of hardcore singer instead of sticking to the way he used to sing. I guess maybe since he plays guitar on it, it takes away from his singing but never the less I am going to be very skeptical when another cd of theirs hits the shelves. This cd sounds exactly how record companies and big MTV think metal should sound and it dissapoints me that Static-X couldn't be original twice."
2,Interesting But Flawed,"It's difficult to determine whom this book is addressed to. A lay reader will come out none the wiser after reading the chapters on complex numbers and groups. Just dressing up powerful general ideas in vague, mystifying, and allusive prose serves no purpose. For instance (p.81) he refers to the heart-breaking charm of complex analysis. Yeah, so? These statements don't edify a lay reader. The same can be said for the discussion of Lie groups (pp. 100-101).A mathematician on the other hand, will find the book redundant, and annoying -- both for its inaccuracies and general, loose vagueness."
3,A 4 for content...a 2 for usefulness,This book has bouts of brilliance but was short on usefulness. I found myself time and again asking what the point of this book was. I wasn't sure if Berlinski was happy that math has taken the turns that it did or if he is waiting for the next mathematical revolution.I'm not sure that I would recommend this book to anyone because I don't know what type of person would find it remotely intriguing.
5,Beautiful -- David Berlinski at his finest,"No one writes with more passion, elegance and wit about mathematics than David Berlinski. Infinite Ascent does not disappoint -- it's Berlinski at his best. Even better than Tour of the Calculus. Highly recommended."
3,The Troublemaker,The sound quality is not near as good as on the original LP nor as good as on the cassette. Compared to the Troublemaker cassette the CD sounds tinny and weak.
5,Great album!!,"In regular rotation, i listen to all 17 of my Willie Nelson albums in a row, album to album...some of them are collaborations with Waylon Jennings, or Johnny and Willie on vH1 storytellers...but most are just Willie and this one is one of his best from the mid 70's, from 1976..."
3,True to form,"This album has a fresh approach! With a new producer it bears a shift from his previous releases without giving up in style of writing and pop craftsmanship - and Duncan remains 'true to form'. He still has cleaverness and a reflective quality as displayed in 'Such Reveries' and 'Good Morning'; Lyrically, he tends to be a bit cute at times and leans a little on familiar styles but overall this is a nice album.Good tracks: 'Good Morning' 'Half Life', 'Start Again'."
4,I enjoyed it,"I approached this book with a bit of trepidation, fearing it might be a typical, tabloid sort of biography, only interested in exposing a celebrity's ""shocking secrets."" I was pleasantly suprised, for this turned out to be quite a journalistic effort, and very respectful of Mr. Rickman's considerable talent. I found the analysis of the London theatre scene interesting, and it wasn't too difficult for even a theatre novice, like me, to comprehend. I thought that the time spent on Alan Rickman's role in ""Sense and Sensibility"" relied a bit too heavily on quotations from Emma Thompson's ""Diaries,"" but overall, I enjoyed the book. The photos included are a nice addition, particularly the ones of a younger Rickman in early stage roles. For an unauthorized biography, I think Ms. Paton has done an admirable job, and would recommend this book to any Rickman fan."
1,Skip it. Worthless especially to fans of the actor,"[...]This is really badly written and quite stupid. Even if some of this stuff is true, it was a waste of time writing it. It is just unbelievable.I bought the book because I was fascinated by Rickman's three-dimensional portrayal of Snape in the Harry Potter movies. The books are great. And the character if wonderful to read. On film I really feel a strong compassion for Snape. I was hoping to get some insights into how an ugly, mean character can become so attractive.There wasn't anything remotely interesting or believable in this book."
4,"Hello, I Love This!","Great compilation. I love it that they are all full length studio versions. Also it's great having them in chronological order with great liner notes and info about each song. I wish they would have left off the 17 minute long ""Celebration of the Lizard"" -- this is a real dog. They could have replaced this with the nearly 9 minute title song from ""The Soft Parade"" which has an incredible funky middle section. Also could have included ""Take It As It Comes"" from their first album - a very overlooked song.This is a band that had about 90-100 minutes of classic stuff - the best of rock, really - but the rest of their material was pretty marginal if not downright bad. So, all their best can't fit on one CD, yet 2 CD's can't help but contain a little filler. I'd rather have that than just 1 CD. But it would have been nice to have a remastered version of ""The Soft Parade"""
5,A MUST OWN...UNTIL THE END!!!,"This is the definitive Doors collection that has been produced to date. Whether you are a longtime Doors fan or this is your first time, I strongly reccommend this collection. Top five reasons why you need this:1. Jim Morrison's masterpiece ""The Celebration of the Lizard"" studio version heard for the first time EVER2. More songs than any other Doors collection3. Beautiful packaging with previously unreleased photos that even big time fans haven't seen4. Songs are in chronological order so you can listen to the progress5. Produced and selected by the band themselves- not some executive at Elektra RecordsMake sure you add this to your collection- ""...untill the...END"""
5,"Highly Readable, Relevant Discussion of American Literature","As a student of American literature and a creative writer myself, I have to say that Williams provides the most convincing and powerfully written explanation of what it means to be an American author. I would urge anyone with an interest in American literature to buy this book, you will not regret it."
4,Good value,"This compass is small, reliable and not too fancy. It can do everything you need a compass to do, but is not exactly luxurious or fancy. It is a good compass for a beginner or for summer programs."
5,Gorgeous Film and Music (of course),"I don't know why it took me so long to watch/purchase this movie. I am a Beatles freak and own every album and had seen Hard Day's Night, but until this reissue of Help! I just hadn't taken the time to check it out. But I have to say that I liked this movie MORE than Hard Day's Night. The gorgeous color and fun storyline were highly entertaining! This is my kind of movie. Quick little one liners, and funny little bits that if you blink you might miss them. Which also makes this film ideal for repeat viewing. The visuals are just outstanding, vibrant colors and great scenery! I highly recommend this film to even the most casual Beatle fan (if there is such a thing!!)"
5,HELP! Looking Back.,"Those Beatles were natural comics. I was ten the first time I seen the movie, and 8 when I'd first became a Fan. I don't regret following thier musical careers, and watching movies like, ""Help"", and ""A Hard Days Night"" remind me of a kinder day. The songs were all hits, and even watching these movies today, you can be young again for a little while."
1,I Was Actually Glad When It Was Over,"Let's just say that some works don't hold up well over time. This was little more than a poorly written 96 minute music video. On a deeper level it is said to have reflected the growing despair that the Beatles felt as their career(s) took over their lives. In any event, it comes across as forced, a hastily written script that gave the Beatles another go at the silver screen. A Hard Day's Night was much better; it rocks while this one reeks."
2,pop music is a major musical taste for all reviewers!,"Some people claimed that Beatles were not good actors, it is really true! but some die hard beatle fans have their own rights& said this is excellent!but I love to say that the pop music is a major of musical taste!Honestl y I'm not a huge Beatle fan. I am giving this film 2 stars because it is the beatles. Additionally, Beatles gave the strongcultural POP influence in the 60's with their musical styles. That's all & PLEASE END OF DISCUSSIONS!In fact, I take a look the other better Hard Rock bands than this HELP,......check out the DVD's like Led Zeppelin ""THE SONGSREMAINS THE SAME 1976 or DEEP PURPLE London Symphony orchestra 1999 or Deep purple at the CALIFORNIA JAM 1974 are excellent DVD's. These legendary bands are also not the good actors in their concert films but musically theyare also the best one."
3,WAIT FOR THE PRICE TO DROP,"I am a huge Beatle fan, but i shall wait for the price to drop before i pay 26 bucks for Help. I own A Hard Day's Night and Magical Mystery Tour, and I paid less than 10 bucks each for those. Coincidentally, I saw Help last night on TCM, and while the song segments are great for Beatle fans like me, the movie itself is a rambling and ridiculous disapointment. what were they thinking...or smoking, rather. I will wait for a better price on Help and hope that the added features will be worthwhile."
5,great memories,advise for anybody to buy and enjoy no matter your age. its a great movie and brings back alot of good memories....buy
3,Not so great- move around,I have problems keeping these in place in my shoes. When they stay put they work well but it is frustrating to have to always be re-positioning them.
2,Diamond in the rough,"Another uncompleted master work! - where have we encountered this before? Plato's Timaeus, Edmund Spenser's Faeire Queene, James Joyce's projected (and unwritten) fourth major volume after Finnegans Wake, Joseph Campbell's Atlas of World Mythology... Are we detecting a pattern here - that authors procrastinate? Nevertheless, though ""incomplete"" this book is important reading for anyone interested in the Gurdjieff Work. For example, Gurdjieff gives a representative psychological exercise:Pay attention to your right hand. Lay it flat. Begin to count to ten with one finger, while you observe the emotional state of a second finger, while simultaneously observing the physical sensations of a third. (What exactly *is* the emotional state of a finger, I still ask myself.)The book's biography is interesting but Meetings with Remarkable Men is better in that regard, and Views from the Real World covers more psychological ground."
1,Disappointing,"Many of the tracks are severely marred by the presence of a high pitched whistle of the kind that induces tinnitus & this makes it difficult to appreciate the more subtle elements of the music which are, sadly, too brief. There is probably just enough good material for one CD. When I purchased the recording I had hoped to hear sounds that could not have been produced in any other way but this was not the case. Perhaps, as the insert notes assert, the machine might have performed better if subjected to an overhaul & it may be that the machine does not respond well to the scratchy images used. Since the machine scans the artwork linearly, it does not even come close to producing a sound that would be comparable to grasping the image as a whole in the fashion propounded by Gysin & Bourroughs. While this is asking too much of a machine with no artificial intelligence, I feel it is also asking too much to pay for the work."
1,What was i thinking?,"Another movie i recently saw for the first time and let me just say IT SUCKS! was a total waste of time and lame, but i'm going to be honest here, i only saw it because of senor mcdermott and i'll also admit that i almost lost it when i saw the scene of him wet and fresh out of the shower and wearing nothing but a towel wrapped around his waist,(that scene was hot). ladies, if you want to see this flick, see it if you want to look at and drool over senor mcdermott. other than that, don't bother and waste your time with this unmenagated crap."
2,SNOOZING DOGS INDEED,"What a shame to have two excellent performances wasted on a script that doesn't go anywhere. Dylan McDermott gives an excellent performance as a writer who isn't going anywhere. Fate decrees he's to ""live"" in a house he's supposed to be selling, a house which was the scene of a brutal mass murder. Enter Tom Sizemore, equally impressive, as a strange, neurotic young man who claims to be the manager of a local grocery store. McDermott and Sizemore strike up a tenuous relationship, and as the movie unfolds, we're expecting some startling revelations...which never come to fruition. Is Sizemore the killer? Or is he just a lonely man looking for companionship? Add an icily cold performance by a young Sharon Stone as McDermott's bitchy editor and you have the ingredients for a tidy little thriller. But no souffle here folks. All the ingredients don't come together and you're left wondering just what you've spent 90 minutes with.Recommended only for the two male performances."
1,Fraudulent Author,"The author's real name is Michael Wulf Kruvant, a mental patient and documented fraud. See the video interview with his brother on YouTube - just search for his real name."
2,Business professors explaining how to run a business,"I fully agree with the premise of the authors, namely that focusing on employee satisfaction is key to achieving business success. The problem is that you could easily bankrupt a business before it got started if you implemented all of the insanely expensive employee centered policies in this book. Knowing where to draw the line is crucial to survival.Like so many business books, ""Hidden Value"" is second hand wisdom, a description by (tenured) academics describing how entrepreneurs ran successful businesses. This is fine for academic pursuits. But if you are putting your life savings (and most likely a few other things you would rather not lose) at risk in a business, ""Hidden Value"" is far from the last word on the subject."
5,Super Electric Blanket!!,I recently purchased the Martex Fahrenheit Vellux Dual-Control King Heated blanket! It is soooo very soft and does not pill at all! The controls are very easy to operate and it has a 'burst' setting for pre-warming! That should be a great feature when winter truly sets in! We have used it a few times already. I bought a new electric blanket last year and it never did work right! This one is great! I highly recommend it!!
5,The world today in Politicians and Presidents,"Well never having read a larry King book considering he wrote so many this book was great. It gave you inside edge on what larry king has seen, heard, and talked about in the years of his careers. It's was great reading about all the people he talk too. I would definely recommand this book to a friend."
4,9th Review,"The dragon sleepsUnder earth, beneathThe world of men,Waking some, a time whenStorms rip the sky.Still, it has yet to fly.But when it does, the dragonWill destroy all before it, once again.A great storm transforms Nick's world. His street, Chestnut Circle, is closed off from the world. Overnight everything changes. Hundreds of trees are where they shouldn't be, ivy is already over-running the houses, and then the brown-clothed men come. Nick and his group of neighbors are herded into a strange world, where two wizards, brothers no less, dwell. One seems evil, the other good, yet both are strange. And the wizards are searching for someone special, someone who is in all probability NOT Nick. But first, they have to somehow manage to keep all of the neighbors in the same place at once, a task more difficult than first thought."
1,This mini wireless optical mouse is very ugly,This mini wireless optical mouse is very ugly. Right now this Mini Wireless Optical Mouse is not working. I just bought this wireless last month but now is not working anymore.
2,"Watch out, Bill & Hillary; you might be next!!!","Kitty Kelley could not have been a better author for this insane book, which would be more useful for ""kitty litter"" than for literature. I fail to see the merit in prying into every insignificant detail of people's lives, including that of Nancy Reagan. Okay, maybe she was guilty of squandering taxpayer dollars on astrologers, jewelry, china, designer clothes, etc. So is almost half of Congress, and THEY are still not being held accountable for their extravagant habits! As for her family problems, the place to deal with them is in a counselor's office, not a trashy book like this! Even Patti Davis had a better reason for writing her tell-all book than this literary leech; at least SHE saw these things firsthand. That Kelley can find time to write such drivel about people is proof that she doesn't have a life!"
4,"expected more, but still decent","Initially the paddle seemed 3 stars, but I'd give it a 4 for after getting use to it. I'm upgrading from a paddle that I've used for over 5 years whose rubber was worn out. The handle was uncomfortable at first, but I eventually got use to it. It's decent for beginners to intermediate players who want to get better, but aren't quite ready to invest in a paddle where the rubber is switched out every 6 months."
1,Paperback book,"This book was terrible, I could not finish it. Writer is a nut and so am I for starting to read it."
1,Exotic but full of errors and inaccuracies,"To the westerners this book may portray an exotic and mysterious East but the authors portrayal of Persia and Islam at the time is full of errors, innuendos, and inaccuracies bordering on racism. To the people who are familiar with Ibn Sina, Persians, and Islam in eleventh century the poor research for this book by the audthor is glaring. There are numerous wrongs with the book and I recommend people to stay away so not to polute their mind."
2,pulp X hack,"the kind of book you wish you hadn't started but finished anyway - mediocre plot, predictable one-dimensional characters, unimaginative, flat writing, humorless, no drama, tension or surprises, whitewashed with thinly researched and mostly erroneous historical ""factoids"", even the soft-core scenes are clumsily done - amazing what gets into print - bought by mistaken click for 1.99 - and maybe worth it at that price - but really there are better ways to waste time. Gave it two stars only because it is possible to finish it if you have nothing else to do (I have a lot of down time at work...)"
5,Excellent,I thought this book was very enjoyable and a great story. I would recomment this book to anyone. It is a very good story.
4,Very interesting read,Noah Gordon is a great writer.....transporting the reader into the intended time period. It was more difficult for me to switch from his Cole family story in the first book to 800 years later in the United States. But it was a good book in and of itself.
5,One of the best books I've read,I don't know what it is about this book but I absolutely adored it. It took me on an adventure around the world in another time. This goes down as one of my favorite books of all time.
4,The Physician: the birth of medicine.,"A young man becomes the apprentice to a man of medicine, a magician, a crook.He gains knowlege from this man, and has a gift which enables him to become the physician to which he aspires.It is an excellent read."
5,Very entertaining!,"Following the experiences of a young lad through his formation to an early physician was fascinating. The author covered a great deal of land and customs, both cultural and religious. Very interesting read, and entertaining."
5,The Physician,"Wonderful read! I recommend to any lovers of historical fiction, especially in the area of medicine.The characters were very well developed and interesting."
4,doctors,A historical novel based on fact. Set in 1041 it a story of a young man who found his calling to be a doctor. It is interesting to discover that Persia was the seat of medical learning but even so religion hampered the advancement of it. A long story but I found it didn't lose its interest.[[ASIN:1453271104 The Physician.
4,Excellent Writing,"Couldn't put it down. My only complaints were not understanding the area well enough to a) pronounce names and places, and b) internally map the region. Those details didn't detract from the story, though, and I felt very involved with the characters."
5,I bought it on a whim. - I've gladly purchased the rest of the series!!!,"I think amazon was running a daily deal on this so I took a chance- so glad I did. I thoroughly enjoyed letting this story unwind and be told. I loved learning about Robert and his evolution from an orphan to a barber surgeon to a fake Jewish traveler and all the obstacles he faced to become a doctor.I truly felt like I was with him traveling - I could smell the scents, see all the sand, and definitely hear all the sounds.Highly recommend - the rest of the series is in the kindle queue!"
5,impossible to put down,Not since Jean Auel's trilogy was I so absorbed by a story! The physician and The Shaman are both so interresting and well written that they are impossible to put down! Please write some more like it!
5,Favorite book and author,"I have just re-read the Physician, only to confirm that, yes, it is still my favorite book. I have bought 3 copies of The Physician in the past month to give as gifts because I want others to share in this excellent story about a 9-year-old boy who becomes orphaned in the 11th century and becomes an apprentice to a ""barber-surgeon,"" the old-time ""doctor"" who dispensed cure-all tonics, entertained the crowds, and treated villagers as they toured the country. This is the first in a trilogy by Noah Gordon who is an outstanding storyteller and researcher. The main character, Rob J. Cole, pursues his dream to become a physician, attending medical school in Persia (Iraq), after adventurous travel over many years, starting in London, eventually reaching the Mid East. There are wonderful and explicit descriptions of differences in religions and cultures. The characters come alive as Cole transitions from youth to manhood."
4,wow... the antithesis of White Stripes,"A wall of sound. Just pummeling low end with vocals that sound like the Melvins. Soo great. This is just sludgy, heavey Seattle rock for the new millenium. And pretty damn catchy too in its own way. Fell in love with this at first listen. Why aren't bands like THIS getting on the radio?"
3,Big Business - 'Head For The Shallow' (Hydra Head),"Know for a fact I saw this band open for the Melvins not very long ago. Their style is probably considered, by most to be in the 'aggressive hardcore' direction. Not exactly my cup of tea, but okay to check out. Several of these tracks tend to sound a bit too similar. But I thought ""O.G"", the in-your-ugly-*ss-mug ""White Piz Azz"" and ""Off Off Broadway"" were decent. Line-up: Jared Warren-bass&vocals, John Devoy-guitar and Coady Willis-drums. Just might appeal to some fans of Murder City Devils, Rocket From The Crypt, Blackout Pact and Pretty Girls Make Graves."
2,Author's credibility in question,"This book was really a disappointment. Some passages were lifted verbatim from her other books--which made me feel ripped off. In ""Moving On,"" she describes how the clutter in her house got out of control to the point where she had a psychic specialist come in. The psychic said the house was ""weeping."" Sarah then found out soon after that her husband was having an affair and the house was ""protecting"" her with its clutter. That's an interesting enough story--EXCEPT that she told the exact same story in ""Simple Abundance,"" only the person having the cluttered house problem was her friend--not Sarah. So, which story are we supposed to believe?This book seems so thrown together. I think she should've taken another year or so to flesh it out, to use all new stories and to find a really good editor.I just don't feel the same about any of her books now."
2,Tired rehash,"I'm not sure there is anything here that was not originally in Simple Abundance save for the description of her recent moves and marriage. It all fees so ""90s."" And I feel just the opposite of the person who said she likes the way the author quotes a lot of other writers in the text. It breaks up the narrative and feels like filler. I'm glad I just looked at this in Barnes and Noble and decided not to buy."
4,In the raw...,"Jeff Buckley's studio recordings all sounded very polished, with his soaring, passionate voice often haltered by big and highly layered production. On these live tracks his voice is naked and raw, often descending headlong into an anguish that the studio versions only hinted at. The musical interpretations of the songs are also less compact, often meandering into improvised explorations in a spirit of childlike adventure. This special edition is well worth acquiring, if only for the inspired renditions of ""So Real"" and ""Lover, You Should Have Come Over""."
4,Not believable.,"I usually enjoy Karen Harper's books, but this time in EMPTY CRADLE she stretched credibility too much. First, the reason Alexis wanted to become pregnant was too far fetched. Then, as fragile as the pregnancy was supposed to be, Alexis was practically a G.I. Jane with all her heroics. Also,the relationship with her mother and with Nick were not too believable either. Admittedly I read and read until I finished the book, but I enjoyed DARK ROAD HOME a whole lot more and BLACK ORCHID was terrific."
5,Most complete hiking guide to the Cuzco region of Peru,"This book details numerous walks and treks which I hiked during a year-long stay in Cuzco. The popular and historic Inca Trail to Machu Picchu is included along with other scenic hikes in the Cordilleras Vilcanota, Vilcabamba, and Urubamba. The text is accompanied by maps for each of the routes, photos, and drawings of area wildlife. I have broadened the text with information about the history, beliefs, and wildlife of the area and preparations and precautions for making a walk or trek."
3,Flawed but still readable story of Bunker Hill,"Seven Days in June has its flaws but is still ultimately worth a look. There are too many misspellings and instances of repetitious adjectives; a good editor could have cleaned those up easily. One thing I liked is that Fast has the characters speaking in the language of the 18th century, F-bombs and all. There are a couple of exchanges of dialogue among the British commanders which to me are incomprehensible; I've read them over and over and can't get what Fast was trying to have them say. The British generals are presented as human beings who, while spending way too much time trying to get laid, are indeed conflicted about the dispute with the colonists. The characters of the colonists are brought to life as well and face the British with varying degrees of courage or cowardice. The climactic battle scenes on the hill are very well done."
2,Lacks spirit,"Unlike April Morning which captured the raw emotion and driving spirit of the revolution, Bunker Hill is disconnected from such history. Fast lost a great opportunity to expand on the colonist's drive for independence.Instead, he creates a pseudo-romance novel using the revolution as a backdrop, spending a large majority of the book on the sexual exploits of the British Generals, though accurate, it fails to convey the spirit, turmoil, and anguish behind this battle.If you still want to read it, go to Google books where it's free."
5,Awesome!,This CD never gets old. All the songs are so beautiful and carry so much meaning. I highly recommend it for Wynonna fans. It is a must have!
5,Very good service,"I was looking for a specific poem in an Edna St. Vincent Milay book. I found the ""look at it"" feature was perfect as I could clearly see which poems were in which book. Thank you."
1,BUYER BEWARE!!! A complete waste of money,"I purchase a lot of products from Amazon. This is the first time I wanted to return an item and these are not returnable. The product is not sampling of the flavors but appears to be a box of all the flavors they couldn't sell individually. There are so many multiples of flavors I would never use (ie: 4 cinnamon, 3 peppermint, 2 watermelon), this is a complete waste of money. And, it didn't contain any of the flavors I most wanted to try."
3,Disappointing,"I had expectations of edgey underground-sub-culture images as specified with the above ""Blade Runner"" connotations. Instead this book is less than inspiring with imagery you can probably find on the internet."
1,I don't like it!,"I'm shocked. It really worries me that so many girls my age read these books. I don't like to sound like a parent, but these books set a really bad example. The characters are so spoiled, it's disgusting. And they're mean, not to mention slutty. How can this book be a bestseller? It's trash. Don't people get bored with girls acting trashy and sleeping around? Look, read what you want, but parents should be warned about this book. Gossip Girl is a serious waste of your time!!"
2,relatively decent. a bit on the wild side.,"I found this book hard to read; or at least hard to read the entirity of it. I ended up skipping everything inside, with the exception of the chapters that featured Nate and Blair. Neither Dan or Vannessa can hold my interest, and Nate's 'girlfriend' is actually quite psycho. I could barely focus during the book, it didn't hold my interest like the majority of the other books did. I wouldn't reccomend it, unless you want to read every book in the Gossip Girl series. The vacation the gang takes is rather crazy, but why am i not surprised? Serena ends up naked, alone, and in the snow. Leaving Nate to find her and warm her back up. Blair almost loses it (again) to brother of Serena, Erik.throw in a gay snowboarding team, and Chuck - and you've got yourself a mediocre novel with crazy sub-plots."
1,bad,"This book is so bad! This is the fifth book out of gossip girl and alot of things in this book are so bad that I have to skip alot of pages. I don't care about Dan and Vanessa anymore. Too boring and even worse when Vanessa's parents show up. Nate's girl friend is too retarded and too unbelievable to believe, and the gay snowboarding team? Are you kidding me? Why does Chuck of all guys become gay all of a sudden? It doesn't make any sense! I hate the character Rusty and I really hate Jenny. Snooping on her boyfriend like that all the time and that's all that happens with her in this book. Jennys friend Elise and Dan kiss. That was really stupid. This whole book is stupid and makes no sense. I loved gossip girls until this fifth one came out."
4,halloween fun,"Super video,great ideas for the holiday.Even better, Halloween is my daughters BIRTHDAY so we get to decorate and celebrate all with barney and her friends.Yeah............."
1,Not worthy to burn in my woodstove,"This movie was atrocious. The gay sex made me grossed out. The film's only saving feature was Leonard Cohen's ""Everybody Knows""."
4,Silvics: excellent all-around book on trees,"Not your typical guide to trees, this book goes beyond identification to list the physical properties of the trees native to N. America, their ecology, and economic uses. For the forester, ecologist, or even the nature buff, these are excellent volumes for learning hard-to-find information on native conifers and hardwoods."
3,I was confused,"I do not know what I expected, but I was confused. OF course, I am no great fan of Modern dance..."
5,Great Romantic Comedy,"The great thing about this movie are some of lines They are either funny or just make you wish somone would say that to you such as when Dermot Mulroneys character Nick says ""I'd rather fight with you than make love to anybody else."" There were so many lines in that movie i loved. However, it was a great movie i didnt want it to end, but the deleted scences are great. Its fun and if you like romantic comedies you are sure to like this one."
2,Not what I expected,This CD is an instrumental. It does not contain the great songs played during the movie. It just contains the background instrumental. I was hoping to get the song play list from the movie. Disappointed.......
1,wedding date,"This movie was very good and the song tracks that were on ithelped to make it so. When ""soundtrack"" is listed it should have the songs on it. For those of us who are looking for it, it is a disappointment to find that this is the ""Musical Score"" and not what we want. Hopefully someday soon the ""soundtrack"" will appear."
3,The Wedding Date Soundtrack,"I really enjoyed the movie, and all of the music they used. Unfortunately, the soundtrack did not include any of the songs with lyrics."
2,SOUNDTRACK REAL SONGS,"HELLO, IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN GETTING THE REAL SONGS FROM THIS SOUNDTRACK OF THE MOVIE, CONTACT ME. TIM"
2,Song from the Love Scene,"The song from the love scene is Maroon 5 - Secret. This song is on their ""Songs About Jane"" album, it's the 9th track."
4,Light Reading with Contemplative Undertones,"This novel is an enjoyable, light read that will make you think about some rather contemplative ideas. It is the story of a seemingly happily married couple whose marriage breaks down on each end. He has an affair, and she becomes involved in religion, something he as an athieist cannot embrace. The story is told with a light and humorous tone, yet all along St. John makes us think about the temporariness of our lives, how seemingly permanent things can change based on seemingly meaningless events. The characters are humorous, all sort of exaggerations, at times, of people we all know.If you are looking for something light, but would like to think a bit, I recommend this book. It is entertaining and easy to read, yet still thought provoking."
2,Overrated,"I picked up this book because The Wall Street Journal gave it a good review. I'm not sure why. It's a very short 230 pages, and can be read in a couple of hours; it has a very light tone, almost flippant in the handling of the main character's affair. Serious subject, light tone - they don't often go well together, and they don't here. There are issues that are brought up (religion, for instance) that are not explored to the depth they deserve. The author is British, and those unfamiliar with English culture will surely be confused at certain social references (for example, the subject of the parish jumble is mentioned several times). Also, the author has an annoying way of starting chapters with dialogue that is not attributed to specific characters, forcing the reader to backtrack once a character is identified to find who said what. Perhaps I'm too used to the gravity of the Oprah line of novels, because I didn't like the fact that I didn't take anything away from this."
5,Updated in 1998 to include 80 new artisans,"Back in print is Hopi Silver: The History And Hallmarks Of Hopi Silversmithing, a revised classic covering the history and hallmarks of Hopi silversmithing. This classic appeared over twenty years ago and was updated in 1998 to include 80 new artisans: it not only reveals the history of past and contemporary Hopi silversmithers, but it provides an important reference of unique hallmarks used by other 300 Hopi silversmiths, including designs, silversmith name and clan, and years he or she began their work. Add color photos and you have a memorable coverage."
4,"Excellent book, CD volume not equalized","My 2 1/2-year-old loves the book and the music. The CD though, its volume is not equalized. Some of the tracks are very difficult to listen to, even with volume turned up to 3 times the normal level. I'm not sure if it is counted as a default so I did not send it back to Amazon. Otherwise we're very happy with it."
1,Dimentions are bogus !,"The dimensions listed do not specify width. I bought a swing that would not fit into the a-frame width-wise. One would assume that a ""deluxe"" a-frame would be capable of holding a nice sized swing. The dimensions should have specified (width, height, depth) !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I wound up having to buy a completely different swing to fit the inside dimensions of the a-frame. Not a happy camper!!!!!Will not buy from this company again !!!!!!!!!!!!!!1"
5,Sound Level Meter,I use this audio meter in a church setting to monitor in house sound levels of the speakers at the soundboard.It has nice large numbers but they can be hard to see unless positioned right. Red lettering would have been easier to read. We have a significant amount of light coming from large windows to the rear of the soundboard setup.
3,"not great, but good",I first heard of Milencolin from my friends. I loved thier music imediatley and became a huge fan. I think this cd is good but i think it's laking more of a hard core punk sound.
1,MEDIOCURE -- Nothing you can't think of,I ordered this book thinking it would give me some original ideas to do with my 3 year son. There is not one thing in this book that I found helpful. It is all very basic stuff that doesn't seem like much fun. I think there are better books out there.
3,Useful but not essential,"A shortcoming of this book is that most of it assumes you have a car. (There are short blurbs on buses and trains but they're of limited use.) While I suppose you could always rent one, there are often more economical and efficient ways of getting about. I was in Scotland this summer and found the restaurant + pub coverage a little outdated; I imagine that will be fixed in the next edition, which is due to come out next spring. A note about Wetherspoon pubs (cheap beer and food) and the non-gourmet food scene in general would have been helpful.I'm not sure you need a guidebook for Scotland; there's so much free travel literature available at the information centres and online that I rarely found myself consulting this book. But if you want a guidebook this is still a pretty good one because it's so detailed and thorough."
1,Waste of money!!!,"The only thing worth seeing was the 15 second interview footage where Paul replies ""only if you marry me"" after being asked if he has any plans to marry. My husband is a diehard Beatles fan and was very excited to get this. He loves anything Beatles or Beatle related and very rarely dislikes songs, documentaries, cover groups etc. However, even he was disappointed."
3,Important Book,This book is one of the first on the topic -- she does have an agenda and that precludes analysis of a lot of narratives that might counter her opinions -- BUT the work she has done is vital in tracing out a subaltern subjectivity of Californios. This is an essential book for anyone int'd in early Claifornia history.
2,Cheap & Unstable,"Very disappointed. Very cheap construction - this thing must have cost a few dollars to build. Wobbly and unstable. Unattractive. And you really have to screw it into the wall to use it. I'm not trusting my wine to this, definitely not at this price. This is the first thing I'll ever return to Amazon after 100's of orders - the first time reviews have led me astray."
5,Best English Grammar book for teaching,"The Warriner's Complete Course in English Grammar is the best book I have found for teaching the subject on a high school, and now, unfortunately, on a college level. Great instructional material, examples, and exercises. This book is the 1965 edition, which I used in 8th grade (prep school, 1967) and an earlier edition as a senior in the public schools (1971.) I continue to use it in teaching college classes and in tutoring students between 9th grade and graduate level, and also for ESL classes taught in an industrial setting for foreign companies. I am particularly happy to have found extra copies of the 1965 edition. I can't say anything about the other editions because I haven't used them, but I would suspect thet are of a similar quality."
5,Nothing tragic about this CD,"Tragedy Andy is an amazing band. Their vocals are well done, and they have their own sound. Almost all of their songs are different, and you can't just say ""Oh, this whole CD is about ...."" I really love this CD, and it won't be coming out of my player until they get a new one out!"
4,Durable Product,The flange for my sewer pipe was only half way broken so I used only half of this ring. I gave only 4 stars because I found the closet bolt hole slots to be a little too small in my application. This would be a better product if the slots were longer. Just my two cents.
2,way overprice for only 75 minutes,"Iron Maiden gives you over 2 hours. So does AC/DC.Guns N' Roses gives you only 75 minutes on this product.Talk about overpriced?""Include me out."""
1,"A waste of money, so boring and not Bible based","I know that my title is rather strong but any game that purports to be a Christian game. I'm very picky about my BIble games. Here is my criteria:1. First and foremost, must be biblically based. I can find all the answers from the Bible.2. Is fun!3. Is great for any level of adults (not including seminary students of coarse)4. Easy instructions5. I will learn somethingTribond failed in all these areas and was truly boring. You can overlook a lot but when you pay good money to be entertained and you aren't, you feel like you've wasted good money .... and time."
2,A book on why you should have an IP strategy,"This well written book will convince you that an IP strategy is important. If you have some ""entry-level"" understanding of the strategic concepts related to IP, this book will be of little help. The concepts presented are of interest but they are presented from a superficial perspective. For instance, the concept of IP map is interesting and is accessible from one of the author's consulting firm..."
1,Ripped from LP (Vinyl) is a rip-off,"This was a great Album in its time and one I wanted on CD. I was so excited when I finally found it here on Amazon. However, it isn't a studio recording but rather a poorly ripped copy from a scratched record with a horrendous audio quality that fades to a very low level halfway through the first song and never recovers. This should be removed from Amazon's product listing immediately as fraud."
3,"Whoa, partner...","Be warned western history buffs - this is a children's storybook. I ordered it based on the title & author - luckily I have a nephew with a birthday coming up, so it's not a total loss. As an intro to the subject for kids, it is well written & informative - but nowhere is it mentioned that this is ""juvenile literature."""
4,Great game bag,"A couple buddies and I picked up this bag for the gym and our soccer games. Good bag for a good price. As others have pointed out, there are not many pockets. I usually just throw all my stuff in and go, so this was not a problem for me."
4,Nice Bag for Young Athletes,"My 11 yr old daughter uses this for her soccer gear.It is well made and fairly roomy. I like the fact that the ball goes in the net on the side because then she knows when she is leaving a practice/game that she has her ball without having to look inside or assume that she has it. The strap is decent and doesn't dig into your shoulder like a cheap bag.This bag is called the 'small' size, but it could probably hold 3 more balls inside the bag.My only concern is that the net is a tad small. I wish that it was a bit bigger. It holds a size 4 ball snuggly and I haven't tried a 5 yet. I am sure it is made to fit them, but it will be tight.Overall, we like it a lot."
2,"""Crystal"" means white","The product description stated the line was ""translucent"" and the color was called ""crystal"". Little did I know that meant the line was white. Fish will spot that a mile away. Thankfully, Amazon took it back."
4,KILLBORNE ON THE KASE AGAIN,"Gail Bowen's fictional gumshoe Joanne Kilborne is back on the case again in this entertaining mystery. While not as engrossing as some of the other entries, the film has some good moments and a riveting if somewhat predictable mystery. Wendy Crewson is very good as Kilborne, combining the elements of a true crime fighter with the concerned single parent. Victor Garber is staunchly supportive as her former boss and possible boyfriend. Robin Dunne is appropriately naive as the tv exec who gets called on to the case.The Kilborne series is mildly reminiscent of the old MURDER SHE WROTE series, giving us well crafted mysteries without too much violence or gore."
2,Separate Essays create confusion,"I was very disappointed with this book, because it isa compilation of scholarly articles all written ina verbose convoluted style. The articles do not flow smoothlyand the book is not to be read as a history flowing from one chapter to another. I do not feel this is a useful history of Italy. It is not an easily understood survey, and the writings expect too much previous knowledge of the history of Italy to be appealing to a beginning reader."
2,damn im not a freaking historian,"Granted, italian history is not one of the easiest histories to understand, but the geniuses at oxford could have done a better job bringing the history down to a level us mere mortals can understand. they talk about the stuff like I have already studied it, like its just a review. In my opinion, in order for this book to be better it would need to be much, much, longer in length with more clear details, especially about the politics. however, it does cover everything, so its not a one-starer. rock on."
5,GREAT!!!,i shopped around before purchasing these they fit my seats perfect i love them they look great in my truck and they were delivered in no time price was awesome too
5,Strange Quantum World,This book really helped my sixth grader gain a better understanding of Quantum Physics. After reading the book and trying some of the experiments she was really able to present her research information well.
2,Sizes are questionable,"I would agree with some of the other reviews stating that the sizes are not standard on these. the shoes I got were too narrow and I do not have big feet. I wear size 8.5 or 9 regular mostly and the ones I got in these were too narrow and long, ended up returning them. So buy them if you have tried these in store and know what size will fit you, otherwise you would be stuck paying for shipping both ways for just trying out the shoe."
2,Disappointing,"I expected more of an appreciative review of this great pope's life. While there are some wonderful scenes (who can forget his encounter with the trembling Gen. Jaruszelski?), I agree with other reviewers that the American bishops' negligence in the clergy abuse scandal receives disproportionate attention. Also the picture quality is quite poor for a DVD. I expected more."
5,soft and comfortable,appears to be good quality wool and is soft to touch. our daughter has loved sleeping on it in her crib. we have an adult sized one for our own bed and it truly does keep you warmer in winter and cooler in summer.
2,This thing STINKS,Literrally. This pad really do stinks. It smells like a petting zoo. Tried washing it and am currently airing out outside. I'm on day 2 now of airing it out and it still stinks. Not sure if I want to put this on my baby's bed smelling like a stinky animal. Makes me wonder if it has ticks and fleas too...
5,Dream a little dream,This is my second SEP and I read the entire thing in a weekend. I am now looking into collecting all of her books keep for myself.
3,"terrific chemistry, not too much else","There's wonderful, breath-taking chemistry between the destitute widow and the reluctant businessman hardened by grief. Her former husband, a crooked televangelist, left her with a frightened son and the hatred of the entire community. Her only aspiration as the story opens is the safety and security of her son, and this is the primary failing of the story, for she has much more to offer, and much more to gain, than simple survival. The romance is well-developed, and the objections of his family and community well thought through and quite believable.The subplots involve another long-simmering romance, faith healing, revenge, and conflicting family loyalties, making the book an enjoyable read, just unpredictable enough to be fun."
1,Don't bother.,"I hated the heroine from the very beginning. She was rude, disrespectful, ungrateful, and just too damn lippy. I wanted to put her on a stake and burn her to death. Just to be fair though, she has a few good points too, but MAN! She runs her mouth like there's no tomorrow that it doesn't matter she has good points at all! I especially didn't like the part where she wanted Gabe, the widower, to say something bad about his dead wife, just so she could feel good about herself. That's not respectful at all, but then I doubt she gave a damn about anything except Gabe and herself.With that said, I still love the author. She has some good books out there: Lady Be Good (which is light as fluff but EXTREMELY funny), Ain't She Sweet?, and This Heart Of Mine. Check those out instead."
5,One of the Best! Funny and full of Surprises!,"I loved this book, and it's the first time that I have ever read a Susan Elizabeth Phillips book and I just found it very interesting and funny. It was really good and I just couldn't put it down. Rachel was funny, and her position was not one that was like a fairy type kind which made it all the more realistic and less of a boring ole fantasy. I touched my heart at how hard she tried to survive, and at the same time taking it as a joke just so life won't seems as bleak. And...wait...I can't tell the whole story! If you want to know what happenes, I guess you'll just have to read the book!PS. Now that I have read this book, I can't wait to read Nobody's Baby But Mine!"
4,Wounded Hero/Heroine,Two great characters! They help each other heal and get past their issues. This story made me laugh and cry.
4,Dream a Little Dream,Susan Elizabeth Phillips writes with a fresh and curent kind of dialogue Dream a little Dream is easy to read but does hold ones interest.
5,Great Read,"Read this book, when I was in 10th grade when it first came out, back in 1983. Was great read and a book that inspired me, along with the novel, Charlie Mike, to join the Army and go Special Forces. What a great read, as most of the authors books were!"
5,Good starter,This is a great little starter book for anyone looking to begin learning about this beautiful plant. It is very small and very basic. An easy read.
4,Looking for more books like this!,"I liked it so much that I'm looking for more publications on problem-solving.I'm a math teacher in a public school in So Paulo, Brazil, and just finished a small study on problem solving in my graduate.Now I will apply some lessons with my students.Thanks a lot."
3,LOTUS SMART SUITE COULD BE SWEETER,"Lotus Smartsuite 97 Lotus 1-2-3 5 Wordpro 97 Approach 97 Freelance Graphics 97 Organizer 97 Screencam 97 (CD-ROM)The software functions satisfactorily in all categories; I had hoped there was a way, however, to restore files saved and recovered after the crash of my hard drive to return these files to their respective categories automatically--a way to circumvent the need to manually restore each entry. As I said: Smart Suite could be sweeter."
1,Broken POS,"This thing came in it's shiny new packaging and when i plugged it in, it didn't even work. brand new out of the package it wouldn't charge the battery. i even bought a second brand new battery thinking ""ok maybe my old battery has just given up."" nope, the old battery was good. i ended up having to spend twice as much for a multi-charger at radio shack that charges every type of battery ever made ON TOP of what i paid Amazon for this thing, and the new battery which i couldn't return because i opened it. i will never buy sanyo anything ever again, and i absolutely understand why practically no stores in southern California carry sanyo products or accessories. i only bought this charger to begin with because someone gave me the camera it goes to for free. apparently they were fed up with the piece of crap too."
5,unique curtain hooks,These adorable curtain hooks really finish the look of the western theme of my bathroom. The best thing I like about them is that they are unique.
3,Her others are mulch better!,"I usually enjoy Jill Churchill, but I found this one to be one of her weakest books. For one thing, she's already used the community school idea in her book, A Quiche Before Dying, and with much better results. You'd think they would ban her from the school after that one! Maybe it was because her strong secondary characters were barely mentioned in this one. What's up with Mel? What about her kids and mother-in-law? Check it out from the library or borrow it from a friend before you buy it."
1,Blow Out!,This tire blew out on me on my second ride on it. I had only 125 PSI and it just blew out coming down a hill. Waste of money!!
3,MILDLY INTERESTING,There is a reason this is a free book. The play was only mildly interesting. Don't even TRY to wade through the author's 'apology' at the beginning.
2,One-sided and stilted relationship,"I found myself more interested in the supporting characters (Estelline and Ruth) than Dani. Understandably Dani has closed off her heart and person after the cruel loss of her lover by a vicious homophobic attack. Into her world of pain and emptiness comes a compassionate nurse, Grace, who Dani reluctantly turns to as a companion more than a girlfriend.In fact Dani seems to relate better to Grace's Aunt and partner than she does to Grace as she becomes a part of Estelline and Ruth's family.While Ms. Lake did a great job portraying the devastating effects of a dynsfunctional childhood and homophobia carried to the max; the interaction between Dani and Grace is flat. Grace becomes a plot ploy to introduce the aunt and her companion who are the true role models in this story. While Dani does once again regains her inner strength and asserts her sexuality, her relationship with Grace is left wanting. This story has its riveting moments, but overall it is uneven."
3,Doesn't swing very much,"I bought this because of the plug-in feature. I have theGraco Lovin Hug Easy Entry Open Top/Curved Frame Swingthat I like much better. This Fisher Price swing is very slow even on the highest setting and if a blanket falls and touches the ground, it stops the swing completely! It also has a post between the baby's legs and it doesn't recline very far, so it isn't great for having the baby nap in. The seat itself is not very large - my two month old's legs are already sticking off of it. It was only $80 here, so I didn't waste my money, but if Graco made a plug-in swing, I would surely get that instead. I have an older Fisher Price swing with similar styling and I like the Graco much better than both of them!"
1,Updated,"2/6/2013 These are made in China, which have been found to cause liver damage.They are great as treats. The only thing that I thought was kinda weird was the fact that there seems to be some kind of red coloring or something. At first I thought my dog's gums were bleeding or something but it seems that its just a part of the product. Otherwise, he goes crazy for them so I'm glad I got these."
2,made in China,"My dog loved these and ate one every other day for some time. She died last year of pancreatic issues. These treats are sourced in China and although the thick, chewy texture and shape, with the rawhide stick in the middle make a great, long-lasting chew that my dog loved. However, under the current suspicious of adverse medical issues relating to Chinese sourced dog treats, I would not allow my pet to consume these."
5,I've Been Waiting For This Ace Spectrum CD Release For Some Time Now,"This is one of my favorite albums from back in the day. Ace Spectrum was a wonderful group that had some of the best harmony. Unfortunately, they didn't stay together long enough to put out more of the soulful sounds that are witnessed here. This was without a doubt, their finest work. Surprisingly, my lp is still in good condition but I had to have the cd to listen to in my car. If you dug them then, you'll definitely still be feeling them now, as you revisit what I feel are some of the best cuts on this cd, ""Moving On"", ""Don't Send Nobody Else"", ""If You Were There"", ""Easy"" and ""Don't Let Me Be Lonely Tonight"". If you're not familiar with Ace Spectrum but are looking for some soulful, throwback R&B from the 70's, purchase this cd. Trust me when I tell you, you'll be glad you did."
5,"""Little sisters are not very much R-V-S-M""",I loved this book when I got my very own baby sister about 17 years ago. I highly recommend it for any parent trying to explain that little bundle they brought home from the hospital.
4,Upbeat and Fun!,"Love this CD for the nostalgia! My favorite track is ""All the Things You Are"" by J.Kern and O.Hammerstein. This year's Oscar telecast produced a montage of film clips to this track including the last scene from ""Mrs. Henderson Presents"" and it was so emotion granting as is the song. Many of the other songs are from a time period right before WWII, but they are just fun and upbeat -- it was the depression, people needed to be uplifted with such such songs as ""Letting in the Sunshine"" and ""Goody Goody."" Judi Dench was asked by someone in the bleachers at the Oscars how it felt to be nominated this year for Mrs. Henderson, and she answered back, ""just listen to the soundtrack darling!"" How great is that???!!!!"
2,Bad customer service by Watch Values,We did not like the watch when it arrived. The strap is cheap quality. We sent a mail to Watch Values (using the link provided in Amazon.com - there was no telephone number provided) asking to what address we should return the watch. Never received a reply. We then contacted Amazon customer service and got it resolved.
5,good movie,once she gets into some good movies she will become a big name star.glad she is making movies now and hope she makes more for years
4,Eden,Very good product. It was worth the wait. I recommend this movie to those interested in the series. There is also stuff after the credits so make sure you stay for it
5,Great for children learning Chess,"Several years ago, my son bought this book when he was in first grade. He loved it because he likes mazes. This book taught him how to move the pieces in Chess. He then went on to join his schools Chess Club, and got a lot of enjoyment from that. It is a great teaching tool for young Chess players. It is also great fun for children who like mazes and puzzles."
1,"A new definition of ""bad.""","With this movie we cross from the realm of ""bad"" to intolerable.To say this is awful makes it somehow seem salvageable; not so. Not even the extreme cuteness that is Nikki Stanzione can make this watchable, even in fast-forward. Not even Ginger Lynn, in an ill-advised cameo, can raise any interest in this at all.Skip it...trust me on this. Not worth it even if you get it for free."
2,She can do better!!!,I really love Barbara Wood. I have read many of her books and found most of them very readable and enjoyable. This one is not up to her standards. Repetative! I found myself skipping paragraphs! I will read Sacred Ground next. I hope it is better. If you want a good Barbara Wood-try The Dreaming or Virgins of Paradise.
5,Thoughts from the mother of a child with Down Syndrome,"I purchased this book to give to a friend who recently had a baby down Down Syndrome, and ended up reading it myself. It's very well-written and interesting, even if you don't know anyone with Down Syndrome. The principles the author sets forth can be applied to any ""hard"" situation in life. It's one of those ""I've-been-there-and-I-survived-and-you-can-too"" type books. I highly recommend it."
5,Cassandra Reed,"I heard ""The Color of Love"" in a West Coast Swing class last week - and had to have this CD! What a great song to dance to - and, if you're into WCS, you know the dancers always sing along with the music. I've been singing ""Color"" all weekend and I'm ready to dance!"
5,Dunbar comes alive!,"Scholar's, Poets, Storytellers bring Dunbar's poetry & stories to life! A must have for any serious collector of American culture and literature. Enjoy! [...]"
3,"Know Before you Buy: Fair Quality, Glossy Finish","Most of the other reviews I have seen for this product match my experience. Quality is just fair - it works, but the action of moving the latch, and the release button, is not so smooth. I could see how it might not last that long, but mine is working ok so far (3 weeks in, and I use the release button daily). One thing that I would have wanted to know before purchasing is that the finish is a glossy finish. I had been expecting more of a smooth matte finish based on my previous keychain that looked identical to this one in every other way."
1,Piece of junk,First the main claw hook broke within a month of getting it. Luckily in my pocket so my car key wasn't lost. I just attached the car key with one of the spare rings and keeled using the key rings. Then 7 months later the spring loaded lock that keeps all the keys in just pops off never found it so have no idea why or how it failed. Not that it matters. Again it broke in my jacket pocket. Still I almost lost two of my house keys when I pulled out my car keys not knowing it was broken and 2 keys fell out onto the ground. Piece of junk do not by will fail at some point maybe not in your pocket.
3,Just OK,"This is not as heavy duty as the one I already had, especially the clasping part. The rings are smaller too. But for the price it's fine."
1,Doesn't maintain its shape,"I have a normal sized car key that is maybe 1mm wide where it needs to go on a key chain. When I tried to put this on the ring, it bent the ring and wouldn't spring back to where it was. I thought this might've just been one bad ring and tried again - now I have two mis-shaped rings."
2,A curiousity,"I can still remember where I bought a copy of this book -- cheap, off one of those carts that used book stores wheel out onto the sidewalk on days it's not raining: a shop just below (east of) Government Center in Boston, very close to the Suffolk County Courthouse you get glimpses of every week on ""Ally McBeal"" and ""The Practice.""The book was originally published by the respected British firm Macmillan in 1982, but probably didn't stay in print very long. The author, an English journalist, assayed to visit and patronize brothels across the globe.Not terribly titillating, as I recall, and of interest only to those in a particular frame of mind, the book is decently written and has its moments. ...The author mostly reports his observations and experiences in a dispassionate and slightly wide-eyed manner, although he allows a little pathos through when the women voice it.An oddity that may not be for everyone's bookshelf...."
1,Lol...eventually a few zzzz's,"Well, let me just say this...and I'm going to make this short. I found this movie more funny than scary. I was not even scared or creeped. I really wasn't sure if this movie was supposed to be a comedy or a horror, or both mixed together. What was up with the tank/truck on the big wheels? What's with the friend wearing the clogs?! LOL! I found myself laughing at things that were probably not meant to be funny. I didn't even make it through the movie...I fell asleep. I think my boyfriend fell asleep too. Well...if you are a serious horror movie fan, don't waste your time. If you want something to watch because there's nothing on, then try this."
5,Pretty cool,I saw this movie on TV. It was pretty cool. It was better than I thought it would be. The monster truck is really cool and the driver is the most disgusting thing I've seen in a while. There's a pretty cool twist in the plot that is revealed later in the movie. It's worth a view for sure.
3,Nuclear Engineering,"For a book that is supposed to be an intro to nuclear engineering, it is very vague.The questions in the homework are difficult to answer if the book is the only source we are using as a reference.There are several typos through out the book.Amazon was super fast delivering the book though...great service."
2,US Nuke Student,"I have read a few of these reviews and what I noticed is that mostly STUDENTS are having a problem in understanding. This book maybe good for professors but it's not clear in deleivering the concepts to the students! 3rd EDITION?! The author needs to let students give feedback. When I used this book we NEVER WENT IN ORDER of the chapters. We always skipped around... if it's so good, why must we always reference other materials?"
5,This is Too Hot To Handle,"From the first track by The Band of Oz to the last track by The Fantastic Shakers, you will find that your feet keep moving. This is a great Shag piece for the dance crowd. It is right in that Shag groove. Yeah Baby!Some of the best performing Beach Music acts are on this CD. The Band of Oz, The Fantastic Shakers, The Catalinas The Breeze, Billy Scott & The Prophets, Part Time Party Time band, The Poor Souls, The Rhythm Brothers, and The Hoilday Band. This is one Beach Music CD that you can put in the player and just hit the repeat button and enjoy. The Rhythm Brothers track of ""Hey Little Girl"" is a true gem. ""Fat Back and Corn Liquor"" is another favorite by The Breeze. All in all this CD is very well produced and a great value to boot. I recommend it for any one who is not familiar with Beach Music and also for the real Shagger. Yeah Baby, Shagadelic!"
5,It's so cute,"When my son was little, he wouldn't put the trash out at night because of the racoons. Each year I buy the kids an ornament that has something to do with the personality, etc. Even though my son is grown up, when I saw this adorable racoon it brought back alot of memories. It has the sweetest face and came well packed and was delivered quickly."
1,FAKE,"please dont buy it,its fake... ive been using this product long enough to say!Usually fake perfumes smeel just like original but the fragrance goes away soon,but this one give me a headache and is nothing like the original"
1,Only good for a mini-workout,"I was really excited to get this item and add to my workout repertoire UNTIL I read the owner's manual and found out you can only use this machine for 15 minutes at a time. And then you have to let it cool down for 15 minutes. What's the point? My workouts are typically 45-minutes to an hour so, at best, this could only supplement what I'm already doing. That information should be posted in the item information area. If I'd known that ahead of time, I wouldn't have made the purchase. As it is, I'm returning it and sticking with my workout DVDs."
4,"More flowers, please","I liked the book. It has lots of useful photos, and the author, being an artist himself, designed the book with the artist in mind, which I found wonderful. The only reason I did not give it a ""perfect"" score, is because I think there are some very common flowers ""missing"", such as hollyhocks, violets and a few others. But considering that there are hundreds of flowers, it is understandable that these flowers are not there."
4,Very nice,"This is a really nice photo reference, with lots of pictures of different kinds of flowers. I do feel, however, that there could have been more pictures of individual flowers. But it's helped me in my art somewhat."
3,""" Classic"" my ass!","I suppose I was hoping for more danger, like in ""Hot Rods To Hell,"" or teenage angst, as in ""Rebel Without a Cause,"" but on a sub-B movie level of course, so I was a little disappointed. But, as with other St. Clair Vision collections I've purchased before, I got a whole bunch of movies, of varying quality, for a very reasonable price. This collection doesn't include any greats, but some of these movies have stories that deserved bigger budgets than they got, making them fairly enjoyable to watch. The rest are interesting curiosities of the ""B"" teen flick genre of the 50's and early 60's. If you're up for this kind of thing, buy it used. You can hardly go wrong if you pay less than a dollar per film. I won't name my favorites, because people who like these kinds of films like them for different reasons, but I will tell you that ""Jail Bait"" has nothing to do with underage sex."
3,Slide sandals,Seem well made. The rubber fingers or nubs on the soles do take some getting used to. Wearing athletic socks at first until your feet and the shoes get broken in a little may be necessary.
2,Not for me,"I didn't make it through this DVD, not a Tony Horton fan. For wt training DVDs I prefer Cathe Friedrich"
4,Walter Mitty - in 3-D sound!,"Great use of the binaural technique, to ensure that you use headphones to catch all the fun! I jumped out of my chair when a door slams at one point - thought someone had just come into my own house! The mystery premise allows the exploration of the 'hero' Willie's relationships - and there needs to be a new word invented for this exploration, since ""mature"" and ""adult"" are taken. How about ""responsible""? This responsibility is contrasted deliciously against the predictable exploits of Willie's pulp fiction detective hero (and alter ego) Short Top Detroit - after some of the teaser passages that are worked into the narrative, I'll never think of gabardine in the same way again! A fun adventure - hope there's more to come."
4,Works as advertised,"This works like it's supposed to. Holds my 1800 without issue. A few notes though:1) Get your own mounting screws, the stuff that comes with it is junk2) I ended up putting up 1x4 supports and mounting everything to those. I didn't put the middle support in, and it doesn't seem to matter.3) My ceiling is is just over 10' tall, and this only comes down to about eye-level for me (I'm 6' tall). It's enough for me, but you might consider getting a longer rope."
2,Why spanish subtitles??,The movie that I bought for some reason had spanish subtitles and I don't understand why. It did not say that when I ordered it and I was surprised when it came in the mail. If you decide to buy this make sure that you are getting what you want.
3,"There were moments, but ...","I went to the college upon which this movie was based. Some of the characters are true to life and amusing, but in all honesty a documentary would have been more amusing than this overly saccharine hollywoodized bastardization of a truely interesting group of people. Yes, it pokes fun of PC; yes, it is a comedy. But it could have been so much more. ""The Pit"" is slowly getting whitewashed by the administration these days. The predominant group on campus seems to have become annoying NYC people who like to refer to their hometown as ""The City"" with a strong emphasis on the idea that there are no other places worth considering. Protests have become less omnipresent. Both the school and the movie have become plasticized and uninteresting.So sit back, do some illegal things, and enjoy the movie."
5,An Amazing Comedy For the 90's,"This movie is a reflection of the changing times is our society. Only this is outragously funny as well. A story of a once traditional college that over the course of time has changed into a political hell, and the one dorm that is trying to fight all the protests, and throw a party!"
5,the best!!,"I have seen this movie soooooo many times and I love it!! I was looking for the DVD version and I dont think its out, but you HAVE to get this movie, you will laugh your A** off!!"
5,Can you blow me where the pampers is?,"If you don't like this movie, then you need to check for your pulse! I have been out of school for three years ( I finished in four), and everytime I watch PCU, I wish I was in my seventh year right along side Droz. Along with Animal House, the greatest satire of college life ever made. And for all of you Gutters out there....QUIT PICKIN' YOUR NOSE!"
4,Classic---Animal House&lt;PCU&lt;Old School,Funny 80's college movie a classic must have hard to find anywhere...ebay doesn't have...
5,"Quiet, powerful, space-saving,","easy and inexpensive to maintain, and the design is just kewl with the dust and odor sensors. I have an Austin air filter in the upstairs bedroom, but did not have floor space for one in the living room. The Rabbit Air's wall hugging design fits in well, and I think it is really going to help with our dust and pollen allergies."
5,Phenomenal CD by an outstanding band!!!,"I found this CD at a dollar store and had never heard of these guys before. The first couple times I listened to it in my car, I thought, ""Yeah, this is pretty cool..."". Then I played it for my wife. We have both been obsessed with this CD ever since!We listen to it so much, that our 8 month old daughter can sing the word ""electrified"" and the phrase ""All I want is the best..."". I have just recently ordered 4 of this band's releases after this one. That's how impressed I am with this band! I will say that this is one of my favorite CDs of all time (and I am very critical when it comes to music)! If you like this, also check out ""Loudness-Thunder in the East"",""Giuffria"", or ""Blue Murder-Nothin' but trouble"". All of these CDs deserve FIVE STAR ratings as far as I'm concerned...enjoy!!!"
2,a big disappointment for preschooler,"Maybe these markers would be of interest to children older than preschool or kindergarten---but our grandson (and we, his grandparents) found these markers to be very frustrating and ultimately boring; unable to maintain interest long enough for the colors to appear! It was actually painful to watch our grandson have to wait for the color every time he used a marker. Maybe older children would find this novel and interesting, but I suspect the novelty would soon wear off for them too. Our grandson very quickly went back to his regular non-toxic markers and crayons to use on the ""Cars"" special coloring book that came with it. It was expensive and a waste of money. I can't recommend this for anyone of any age."
2,Bitterly disappointing attempt at US commercial success,"Having appreciated Gomez from the outset, I can't help feeling disappointed - even cheated - at this latest release. The downloaded title track promised a return to better things after the middleing 'Split the Difference', but it stands quite alone. There is a clear American influence at play, a reflection of the band's new life no doubt. Good luck to them! They can still entertain, as I saw at last night's performance in Wolverhampton. How did the new material go down? Well, I think they failed the acid test for many fans. Lucky they had the old stuff to start and finish with. Maybe people like a little more 'sha-la-la-la-la' in the States, but at home we prefer rock with the earth still on."
3,One Out of Three Ain't Bad,"On the Up-Side: If you've ever wondered what it would be like to walk into a club and hear Maestro Al Jarreau singing standards with a jazz quartet, Disc One will make you very happy. Very happy indeed. Though the mid-80s recording technology is a little rough and carries with it a tell-tale analogue hiss, the performances are swinging and sweet.On the Down-Side: Discs Two & Three, however, are a significant disappointment - unless you dig Al Green and Bill Withers, the two artists that comprise the remainder of the set. In addition, liner notes for the three-disc set are non-existent.Still, for a fan of Al Jarreau's brilliant singing, the first disc was worth the price of the set."
3,Vivid guide to Beijing,"I was impressed by the vibrant photos and informative commentary and bought this Insight Guide before my second visit to Beijing.I realized soon afterwards that while this book makes for captivating reading, it's really not that useful for planning activities and day-to-day getting about. There are no Chinese characters given for most place names and the romanization of names and addresses isn't pinyin, so you can't be sure how words are pronounced. This is a great book for background reading and vivid photographs, but you can't get by on this book alone once you're actually on your trip."
3,China China China,"This cup is absolutely beautiful in the detailing, design, and shape. HOWEVER! The description says the cup is made in England. Not so. On the UPC, it says ""MADE IN CHINA."" I contacted Amazon, who sent me another one. Again, ""MADE IN CHINA."" When contacted again, they offered to give me a full refund if I wanted to return the cup, or a discount on the china cup. The cup is so beautiful that for the price I am willing to sacrifice the English quality and see how this cup measures up. If you're thinking about buying this cup, I would recommend it, but be warned, you're probably going to get one from China. Amazon's customer service was great during the process. They answered my emails within 12 hours and between having the first cup shipped, to the final resolution, it probably took a few days."
5,Little Gems,"With this book, Christopher Anderson -- a widely celebrated combat photographer (his pictures from places like Afghanistan, Gaza, and Iraq have won almost every major photojournalism award) -- turns his wry and insightful eye on life's more intimate moments. The fact that he's using a toy camera here gives each of his photos a surreal, fun-house-mirror sort of feel, and enhances the head-nodding sense of familiar-yet-unfamiliar shock that seach of his pictures seem to provoke. Also, his sense of humor shines through: The picture of two nuns on an airplane is like the punchline to some perfect joke. Highly recommended."
1,For Real Hardcore Try These...,"Blush and Petros provide some useful material and leads to othermaterial, but overall this is sensationalistic cheap tabloid hackheadline seeking journalism. There are only two books that trulycapture the reality and insanity of making it on the fringes:Azzerad's Our Band Could be Your Life for music and Ray Carney'sCassavetes on Cassavetes for film. The punk scene, in film and music,is brilliantly, scarily depicted in both--the fate of garage artistswho too much of the world takes for garbage artists. The doom and thehorror. The excitement and the craziness. Long live indie art, theone thing you can't buy or sell, even in Amerika. Long live HarmonyKorine and his dad John Cassavetes. Long live Azerrad and Carney aschroniclers of the real, the beyond the hype, the stuff they wouldn't"
2,Terribly biased,This author thinks everyone should take his opinion as gold. He sticks to some traditionalist opinion of hardcore and doesn't let anyone else sway his elitist opinion. He's just as bad as the pretentious hipsters he blames.
3,overly brief,"This book provides explanations that are too cursory to serve as more than a good reference to formulas and proofs. At times the explanations are very quick and undetailed when it comes to some of the more complex derivations (for example, the 21 variations of the basic trigonmetric theorems), and at other times the book is overly thorough when it comes to some entirely basic concepts that don't require much of an explanation. While this book is sufficient to provide a slight refresher to someone who has previously learned all of the material, it doesn't have the content necessary to thoroughly relearn the material and by no means can it be used to teach this information to a first-timer."
5,Loved it!!!!!!!!!,"I have just completed reading DESIRES of the Heart. I found the book to read as if I knew the characters that were being written about. I think I can relate to so much of what was going on in the story, because I am a survivor of a marriage not meant to be. It makes me hope to find a man like Hunter one of these days. I also like that there's no cussing and no sexual filth in the book.Looking forward to your 3rd book, Pamela!!!!And.......I TOTALLY LOVE the ""3""!!!!!!Keep Looking Up......There's nowhere else to LOOK!! ;o)"
1,It's a Chinese knockoff - BEWARE,"This ring is a ripoff of ring made here in the U.S. by Edward Mirell. It's absolutely identical, but not the real black titanium that Edward Mirell uses and that their parent corporation has the patent on. So beware - the black WILL come off pretty easily as it is only plated. It's a shame that Amazon sells knockoffs, and that Edward Mirell is powerless to stop them."
4,Almost Perfect,"My husband LOVES this ring. Everyone compliments him and he's happy to have a non-traditional ring. Plus, his entire wardrobe is black so it matches perfectly.One con:Where the black meets the titanium, it's a tiny bit rough and scratches a little if you touch there."
5,A great resource,The epic level handbook really does extend the charcter levels out to at least 50. The book uses feats as the means acomplishing this. The feats range from granting higher level spell slots to adding one point to an ability score. The epic level spells are based on a template that you modify based on effects that you want. The monster chapter is well designed and easy to us to create epic monsters.A great addition to anyones D&D collection.
2,the content fails to match the title,"What do you do when your character has surmounted all obstacles, reached the very pinnacle of power and is now a force to reckoned with in the world? According to this expansion, one gets a +7 instead of a +5 and discovers that 1000-hp undead happened to be lurking around the corner instead of 10-hp ones. Epic becomes ordinary.The concept of constructed epic spells is interesting, although the mechanics expose weaknesses of the d20 skills system. Many of the monsters have interesting back stories that should be taken as examples of how to create ultimate villain creatures rather than as a shopping list for super-dungeons. And fans of Greyhawk/Forgotten Realms will be interested in seeing the d20 translation of their most famous inhabitants.For contrast, I'd recommend the 2nd edition Dark Sun version of this book (Dragon Kings), which extended high level characters in unexpected and interesting ways and actually added depth to the world."
3,You get what you pay for!,"I've heard alot of negative feedback about the Epic Level Handbook. While people are certainly entitled ot have their opinions, one very important fact needs to be kept in mind: RPG's are a business. WotC has produced the product that people have been asking for. They have done more market research and playtesting than TSR ever did, and since many RPG players are kids who grew up playing video games, it comes as no surprise to me that the ELH reflects their tastes and ideas about what makes a good game. Before you start railaing against the ELH for what it is (a product designed on market research), you should take a good hard look at the type of people playing the game.With that said, I found the ELH a good value for the money. There's certainly enough material there to make it worth getting, particularly the epic dragons and demilich."
1,It looks nothing like the picture posted.,"I just got a mat in the mail... It's black one with blue outline. That's it. Sure the service is quickly, but this is a wrong picture."
4,This album kills!,"I finally got a copy of this rare classic the other day and I can't say I was disappointed! Nothin' here but great riffs to go with matching lyrics that help create some of the most killer and memorable songs in metal history. ""Undead"" is my personal favorite, alongside ""Humanoid"", and I strongly advise anyone who hasn't heard it yet to get this album someway, somehow and make your ears bleeeed!"
4,screaming black and blue,"Again, the sixth Rancid alblum delivers with a new and unique sound pasted with the simplicity of Let's Go, the melody of Life Wont Wait, and rocksteady rythm of Out Comes the Wolves. After the aggressive, hardcore slap of the previous alblum, fans get the long await sequel alblum to the sound we recognize Rancid for. Fall Back Down (youve heard it on the radio) stands as the bands commercial single, but tunes like Red Hot Moon (traces of the Time Bomb-type stacato reggae beat) and Spirit of '87 (with the trademark snearing voice of Tim) distinguish the alblum as another monument in punkrock music, which, unfortunately, is failing with new bands, commercial and indie. Buy this alblum, love this alblum, and thank these aging punks for keeping Rock and Roll real, meaningful, and in your face."
3,quite different,"I bought this CD approx. 5 weeks ago, and I have to say that I was a little disappointed. This CD was a little more pop that I had expected. However, I still like it quite a bit, as Tim Armstrong is one of my favorite punk singers of all time..oh yesPurchase a CD by his band The Transplants!! They are amazing!"
2,come on...,"Am I the only one who actually listened to this album? Look, I wanted to love this album as much as the next guy. I, like most of you gutterpunks out there, thought rancid could do no wrong. But I knew something was up when I saw them on MTV. This is their worst album to date. There are a few good songs and some mediocre, but way below the standards they set on ""And out come the wolves"" and ""Lets Go"". I never thought it would happen, but rancid let me down."
1,Rancid may have lost it!,"This is one of the worst cd's i have ever heard in my life. I first heard this CD at work when my friend put it in our little boom box, i thought what is this [bad stuff] since normally we are banging are heads to great Rancid classics like Dead Bodies, and Maxwell Murders but instead we were graced by the pure [horridness] of Indestructible. We then looked at the Lyric sheet to make sure that they did not by accident slip up and put the wrong cd in the case. But are hopes were crushed when we found out that Rancid had made one of the worst cds on the planet. This album is not even worth the money or the time to burn it, yes it is that bad."
5,PUNK RAWK!!!!!!!,"I have been a rancid fan for about ten years now, and this album brings them back to their roots. It's fast, hard and raw. It doesn't have the reggae sound of life won't wait, or the pop punk of ...and out come the wolves. Songs like indestructable, Travis Bickle, and roadblock are punk rock at its best. My favorite rancid album is still let's go, but this album brings them back to that sound. The lyrics are very well written. Tim Armstrongs break up with his wife, Brody, is all over this album. If you are a fan of fast punk rock, I would definetly recommend this album"
1,I was doing some deep thinking...,and it hit me! Rancid is just bad Clash. Plain and simple. Rancid = the clash -joe strummer + bad pop hooks.Enjoy the music kids.
5,THE BEST RANCID CD EVER!,"This cd is the best cd ever! Every song besides ""tropical london""are good. The best songs on this cd are: Start now, Ivory coast, David Courtney, and Red hot moon... The greatest punk cd ever!! Way to go Rancid! I hope ur next cd is even better and I am sure that it will be."
2,It was a blur....,no songs stand out--very dissapointing. I've heard better from them. I was expecting a mix of last year's release and let's go/out come the wolves...maybe I'll give it another try and hope it grows on me.
2,What a let down!,"Not at all impressed with this slow mediocre release. Maybe it's to appeal to the young MTV masses that have just recently discovered ""punk"". A few songs are tolerable, but when you have 19 tracks that isn't something to brag about. After seeing them play a good set at warped I had some anticipation for the cd to come out - huge disappointment. Avoid! Save your $ and buy one of there better releases like And out comes the Wolves or Let's Go."
4,rancid rocks,i only like them because benji from good charlotte likes them.haha just kidding...this CD is very good. awesome punk music. BUY IT!
4,"Great album, but not their best","This is a great album, no doubt about it...but it's not as good as Out Come The Wolves, Life Won't Wait, or Rancid 2000. Tim has a vast majority of the vocals on this. I would have liked more Lars in there. I didn't hear any lead vocals from Matt. There is no real theme to this album like their past few. It's got several songs that sound like they belong on Life Won't Wait, a few from their previous release, and a few more from Let's Go or And Out Come The Wolves. Best tracks...Idestructible (1), Arrested in Shanghai (8), Spirit of '87 (11), and Otherside (19). The album is definitly worth the price"
2,Ouch!!!!,"nooooo!!!!!! Rancid, how could you? why did you? all questions I asked myself when I closed my eyes painfully and turned off this album. really a shame, this album puts a bad mark in their reputaion. Even if you're a huge fan, don;t get this one!"
3,METAL!!!!,It's a Good cd--needed more songs and less jamming but i really like it. Great guitar sound.
4,Carolina Beach Music,"This is great music during the shag era-Carolina Beach music!! 1960-1968, ""The shag originated in S. Carolina. I Loved It"
3,Repetitive,"Good information - a lot of things I learned for the first time that I didn't know could be attributable to B12 deficiency! But the biggest annoying thing about this book that caused me to flip through it quickly & skim the pages for information is that it's highly repetitive. I don't know why the author found so much redundancy so necessary. Say it once or twice, but if you say it a hundred times you turn off the reader."
5,Lifesaving!,"35 and recently diagnosed with pernicious anaemia. This book educates you and confirms all symptoms! Levels as low as 200 could barely walk and stay awake, but doctor said just take sublinguals. Only raised level to 400 told that was great. Symptoms of numbness and tingling in hands and feet, muscles felt tired, seizures. Take monthly injections and feel great! Have to keep my levels above 800 or I feel terrible! Book is awesome!"
3,Not bad,"A bit of a hard read to follow at times and boring but most ""medical"" books are boring so no surprise there. Not a lot of technical terms so no getting out the Medical Dictionary to find out what things mean. Overall not bad for what it is."
1,Repackaged old title,"This book is advertised as if it is a new or different book dealing with Bible numerics. It is the old book by Karl Sabiers titled Astounding New Discoveries, and I consider it misleading to sell this book under a new title without clearly stating that it is a reprint of Sabier's book. Has a photo of Ivan Panin on page 135."
2,"Fun, but for children","This is a fun game but it gets repetitive and it isn't the most fun if you're older. There are a lot of ways that you can design your own horse, but it seems difficult to earn coins and progress in the game. I may just not be getting it, lol."
5,Pony Friends,I bought this game for my 10 year old granddaughter. She had used this game before from a friend and wanted her own. She loves it. It is different from the Pony 2 Friends so getting them both was OK as they did different things.
1,Nothing special,This book is nothing special. There is nothing you can learn here beside what you already know if you are a shotokan practioner. Maybe a beginner would like this book but and don't recommend it for beginners either because the contents are not completely Shotokan karate. And the price is very high for what it is. In the market there are many much better books than this one.
4,"Good, but not her best","IMO this bk. wasn't as suspenseful as some of her other books. There just wasn't much suspense & if there would have been more, I would have liked it more. The characters, plot & mystery, however were good.Some people might not like the ending (it isn't happy). What bothered me about this bk. was the side plot/assault investigation. I kept waiting for the assault case to somehow be connected to the murder cases, however it never was."
4,Dust to Dust,Great Mystery!!! Have only come back to reading since the purchase of an ereader. Enjoy the ease of ordering books on line.
1,What a disappointment!!,I started reading Tami Hoag with Ashes to Ashes. I immediately sought out her other works and have enjoyed them too. It seemed to be she evolved as a writer & got better with each book. Dust to Dust has none of the depth that her other books have. I didn't care about the characters and hated how it ended on a lack luster note. I hope this was just a bump in her writing.
3,Neither really bad nor really good - SPOILERS (sort of),"I'm probably the only one around here who enjoys Tami Hoag's characters BECAUSE they are clichéd, and I hope to read about Kovac and Liska and Conlan and Quinn again in the future. However, I wasn't impressed with the slow-paced and convoluted story. The killer's motive seemed too farfetched; it struck me as out of character for one of the female leads, who was described as a recluse, to keep condoms in her nightstand; and the suicide within the last fourth of the book was overdone and unnecessary - plus I hated for a character to lose his love interest. I had been looking forward to a nice, clichéd (= optimistic) ending and hated to be disappointed."
3,"so, so",I didn't think the book had very much suspense to it. It seemed like the she tried to focus your attention on other characters to avoid discovering the truth but she wasn't very good at doing so. I figured what was going on before the end of the book.
3,Not the usual,"I have always loved Tami Hoag's books and eagerly awaited buying them as soon as they were published. Dust to Dust in no way compares to Ashes to Ashes. It took a long time to establish a connection with the characters, which is unusual for Tami Hoag. The suspense was good, but I always liked the romance and the ""happy"" endings. That's one reason I liked her books. This one was ""not the usual."" I was disappointed."
2,Not her bailiwick,"While the basic plot is solid, for some reason the author seems to have been (uncharacteristically) aiming for gritty, super-hard-boiled characters in this book, so much so that it interferes with the telling of the tale. For example, several characters' smoking habits are covered in excruciating detail, and Sam and Nikki have such jaded world views that you almost stop pulling for them, and retreat to the role of observer instead of participant in the story. In other words, Ms. Hoag's usual sense of humor is conspicuously absent in this one, and I ended the book feeling depressed and let down."
2,5 Stars for footage - 2 Stars for the rest,"I'm sick of the parasites that try to make a living off a great president. Where did David Taylor get such details? I'm sure in his mind. I would like to know the references in which he got his information, maybe from Jack's brother Frado (Ted). It's sad that instead of making a documentary with the focus of the inspiring way he was changing The United States for the good and involving the youth who would eventually run it, the focus instead is somehow he was HIGH the whole time he was in office. This is a crock of crap. I just bought this and watched it, and it's going in the garbage now."
1,rca lyra,Product is junk. Only 1 of the 3 I purchased is still working. None were dropped. They just froze up.
1,Be careful..,My daughter and her friend both ordered this product and both had problems with it. They both found it was defficult to download songs and my daughter's developed some internal problems which she ended up having to return the product to the manufacturer. It was a 8 week for a replacement product. It seemed like a nice value at the time...but beware.
1,Too good to be true,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband. I thought it was probably too good to be true to get a 5 GB MP3 player for under $100. And it was! After less than one day of use he got the same message others got: ""File system corrupted."" I called RCA and was told the unit would have to be replaced. Now two weeks (and $10 for UPS shipping) later and he still doesn't have an MP3 player and we're out over $100. I'm hoping they have made some changes and the new one we get from RCA will have software upgrades to prevent this problem. If it happens again we'll have to return it to Amazon and cut our losses."
2,"Bad story, good actors","This story is well overdone, a story of enemies having to work together to survive?Having said that there was not even a pretence of trying to make the story realistic. A ww2 German u-boat was an incredible dirty place. Sailors had beards, the director could have made an effort to make the setting more realistic. Furthermore, I doubt very much that a US crew could work without considerable training a German U-boat.Finally, the ending of the American crew betraying their country because their officer made a promise, I found extremely unrealistic."
4,Janet - Design of A Decade DVD,"Product Quality is fine. But I dont know why they edit ""Miss You Much"" by cutting the dance show in the last part."
5,Classic,"The VHS of Design of a Decade is classic. All the videos included in the package are excellent. Janet is one of the best performers out there, with her music, she also makes some of the best videos with her dancing and everything.Highlights include the fun ""Runaway"", the tight groove ""Rhythm Nation"", the solo dancing ""Pleasure Principal"", the beautiful ""Come Back To Me, the anthem ""Nasty"", the hit ""Love Will Never Do (Without You)"", and many others. They are all awesome!"
3,step stool review,got this product right away. good price but two of the caps on the legs came off right away and I hardly used it. I wouldn't buy this again
4,name of a song,The soundtrack was alright but i really want to know the name of the song and artist who were playing when matt was srpay painting the team van....can someone please help me out?
3,Requesting Song Info,"The movie was funny especially with the skateboard through the window of the escalade. I have been trying to find the name of the song from the movie when they get Sweet Lou's van and Matt pimps it out....there is a song that mentions being ""a punk hippie white boy from the i.e."" does anybody know the name of it or the artist....preferbely both...."
2,GRIND the soundtrack is wack but WHITESTARR is all that!!!!!,i think that some of the songs on this cd are cool but for the most part it isn very good. one band i love though that is on the cd is WHITESTARR. theyre from la and play good ole rock n roll. i dont know why theyre on there as SLR whitestarr but its them for sure i know the song from theyre ep i got at a show. alright. buy it for that of anything.
5,Help,"Hey, this movie rocks. i dont have the soundtrack but i was just wondering if anyone could answer this: what is the name of the song that is playing while they are jumping over their van near the beginning of the movie??? thanks alot... can you plz email me at poodles_in_paris@hotmail.com"
3,Good movie but............,"This movie was good but the beggining was most disapointing, well i can't say but well the girl in phantasm 2 dies it is very disipointing! But I do reccomend this movie to you!"
5,entertainment,These DVD are such a good resource when you only have limited TVand need to entertain the little guy. Very educational for the child.
5,Amazing Author,"We're big fans of this author's Theodosia books. Having exhausted those, we've been seeking other titles. My nine-year-old son devoured this one over the course of a couple days and a few bus rides. He found it very difficult to put down and says he only wishes there were more! We found this in the library, but will be seeking out a copy to add to our permanent collection."
3,Your basic Mobil guide,"I have the 1998 edition which does give room prices. However this is simply the regular Mobil travel guide with listings done alphabetcally by state and by city and info on number of rooms, what amenities (pool, restaurant, gym,etc.) are available.Only lodgings that allow pets are included. An introduction gives tips on traveling with pets but that's it. Useful if you're traveling cross-country but of course you have to check first to see if the hotel/motel has restrictions on size, type of dog or whatever."
2,Kinda getting old...,"I have had playboy going on 3 years, and I gotta say its getting boring. All politcal, and hardly any girls or stories. I would buy penthouse and Time seprately if I wanted to seperate the two."
4,How does one review Playboy,"Playboy is, well, Playboy. Excellent pictorials (including full but not gratuitous nudity) and cartoons beyond compare. The magazine is shrinking from the old days, likely a concession to costs; but still has a lot of content. Their interviews are generally instant classics.Their very liberal leanings are still quite apparent. A few years ago that was almost enough to get me to cancel after decades; but in the last couple of years, they seem to have diminished the liberal blather considerably making it more enjoyable for me. Some of the articles and stories get rather tedious and long; but I still find it enjoyable reading on balance. It's worth the price.Oh, and they've copied Esquire a bit now with several pages of mens' fashions. To me, they're comical (a $1,200 sportcoat over a $180 shirt and $60 tie??); but some may actually find them informative."
1,hornswaggled,"Watchzone is clumsy and incompetent. The product I ordered never arrived. Instead of the $900 Gucci men's watch that I ordered and anxiously expected to arrive, I received a $450 woman's watch that Watchzone later reluctantly claimed was mispackaged. Watchzone paid no mind or concern for the effort I had to take to drive to UPS (the package had to be signed for an I work during the day so I had to drive to a UPS location to sign for it) or for the time and effort it took to repackage and drive back to the UPS location. When I called to try and return the obvious mistake, Watchzone was clueless. At no time did they apologize or offer any compensation for their mistake. Needless to say, after this painful experience, I did not try to get my originally ordered watch."
4,Kinda wish the amazon store had warnings,I liked the story. I'm a big slasher/horror fan and liked the vibe. I just wish that the amazon store had better warnings about comics that were not formatted correctly for kindle fire Hd.I had to squint throughout reading to see the font.
3,Not his best,"I have read all of Wilbur Smith books this one is not his best, not enough going on too much around the gold mine."
1,If you like Céline Dion (which I don't) you might maybe sort of like this...maybe,"The negative reviews from French buyers are right on the mark. I'm a big fan of Pascal Obispo (who produced the album), and I was frankly disappointed. The music is well-produced but insipid and uninspired -- and the singing? Bof!""Hein?"" you may say -- ""but she won that contest"", etc. Well, her singing style is similar to Céline Dion, but without the power or the phrasing and timing that Céline has. And while there's nothing in particular that is terrible about this album, it is surprising how the lack of anything very good can make something so bad.So if you're looking for good French pop, try Keren Ann or Autour de Lucie for a more etherial sound, Lise Boyer (from Québec) for a more pop sound, or Jeanne Cherhal for a singer/songwriter sound."
3,Watercolor Artist,Recently received the June and August issues. Some good articles. Thought there would be more information for beginners--more practical info.
2,Not as good as they used to be.,"for overpriced products, I expect top value. These used to be worth the cost, not so much now. Still, better that crayola."
3,eh... they're alright,"i got these when they HADn'T raised the price, when it was $8/9!it was great value for the price so i got them in addition to the watercolor prisma pencils which are FANTASTIC.people don't understand. they are used to OUTLINE, NOT like the creamier premier colored pencils.for their job, they get it done, but they aren't very good for blending etc.still.... better than crayola and the price difference isn't that wide.if you want something somewhat decent for your crafty kid, at least these are MUCH better than rose art, which stinks, and crayola, which is somewhat better than rose art :)the quality, however isn't the best. the dark green in my set's lead was way off the side ( not centered), and made it hard to sharpenthey should have been presharpened. this weeds out the bad pencils and it looks nice and is convenient.shame on you prismacolor :)anyway i still like them... it's not that expensive, so spring on the cheap price!"
3,How to kill your neighbor's dog,"This movie was recommended by a friend.I anticipated it's arrival, when it came and I watched it, I thought it was kind of cute, but at times, the humor felt rather strained. In retrospect, a move to rent, not to buy. As a Brit married to an American woman, I could identify with the main character to some extent, but not as much as Hugh Grant in 'did you hear about the Morgan's?) That movie was much better."
5,Very Funny Adult Comedy,"The previous reviewer has it all wrong - this film got a very limited release because it was royally messed with by the people who financed it. Those of us who have followed it since its premiere as the Toronto closing gala know the score. Of course, if you don't like a film, you'll find any way to say so. This is a very funny, witty film for people who like intelligent comedy. Read the reviews - NY Times, Boston Globe, Entertainment Weekly, etc. raving that it's Branagh's best role. You won't be disappointed (except that the DVD is full screen instead of letter boxed - which was a surprise for me)."
4,Good product,"This is overall an attractive and reliable product. My only complaint is that it tends to accumulate dirt. Washing machine does remove most, but not all of it."
5,Absolutely Brilliant!!,"I loved this book, and could not put it down. I had to finish reading it, to see what turn the story would take next. The descriptive passages were so well written that I felt like I was really there taking part in the action. The author's descriptions were never long and preachy, just very interesting. This is a most marvelous first book by L Glass, and I look forward to more writing by this author."
2,Good but...,This is a really well produced DVD and includes some great techniques. BUT it DOES NOT tie in a wing! This was an incredibly rude surprise considering the tying of the wing is the most critical part of full dress flies. Went into elaborate detail on so many other aspects it was just a TOTAL letdown not seeing a single wing tied in. Lame. Sorry. Fail.
3,Moulin Rouge,"For some inexplicable reason, Amazon has removed the rate-movie feature from the main product page. One must now write a review in order to rate a movie and generate recommendations. This is not a review, but merely a means to allow me to rate this movie and improve my recommendations. If you are as annoyed by this new ""feature"" as I am, please register your protest w/ Amazon help."
1,What Doctor recommended this?,I tried this yesterday walked in the pair for a while felt discomfort the entire timeWhat podiatrist recommended this?Heel pain not helped at allI could never recommend this itemtotally disappointed
3,cushion-y but not helpful for pf,"This is a cushion-y product, but I didn't really find it too helpful with pf. It took some getting used to; almost like it was trying to keep my foot lined up straight in my shoe. Like some of the other reviewers stated, it does take up space in your shoe. You really do have to wear them in lace up shoes; I wear them in sneakers with plenty of room in the toe box & it sometimes feels like there's not enough space. Especially after wearing a pair shoes all day."
2,No difference,"These did not help my husbands heel pain at all. They didn't make it worse, but they did not help either."
1,absolute dud!,"no releif...just more pain, but minus my money. junk. trash. i tried and tried, but these cups are crap. never again."
2,Heavy duty heel cups,"Not only did these heel cups not help with my bruised heel (heel spur?), but they shifted my feet forward in my shoes and caused my toes to be rubbed, almost blistered."
3,Tulie review,They help relieve the achilles pain but I have to wear them under my socks to keep them from slipping. They also cause the toes to be crunched. Worth it for the pain relief.
4,Exactly what I'm looking for!,"Although a little on the pricey side, this is the best gel heel cups I've used to date. I wished I didn't waste my money on the Dr. Scholl's version. No other similar product provides that kind of coverage & gel cushioning. It covers the back of my heel that I'm trying to cushion since I've recently had a painful Achilles tendonitis on one of my feet. So far I've used it for a week & it holds its shape and also fits well with my Teva Dozer sandals. Highly recommend this product."
5,prevents shin splints,The best for preventing shin splints (sp?)! Better than any orthodics or special sneakers. Wearing these while running (or while walking) has kept me from getting these painful shin splints. Always experienced great pain while running or playing sports in high school. A teammate gave me a pair of Tuli's sometime later; that pair has lasted me 20+ years. Hard to find in stores; finally found a new pair here...soft and comfortable. Did I mention I can now run 5 miles without experiencing shin pain? Also gave a pair to my 89 year old dad who loves them and is now much more comfortable doing his daily walk.
3,Too much backing,"These heel cups were highly recommend by my podiatrist. I think they would work great but my problem is that the back of the cup is too bulky. It kinks inside my shoe and causes some irritation. I'm thinking about cutting down the back side and making them a little flatter instead of ""fitted."" It could be that I ordered a size too large (though I followed the guidelines) but I have to say the cushioning is the best I've tried (and believe me, I have tried many heel inserts!)."
5,Needed resource for consult medicine,"As an internal medicine resident, I just completed my consult med rotation. I purchased the book as a supplement to my assigned readings and found the text very helpful. I particularly liked the outline format and broad coverage with up to date information."
5,one pretty song after another,This album is awesome.I play it several times everyday.Lets Celebrate Jesus is beautiful.
1,Towels do not meet quality I thought they would,"I washed these towels in gentle soap. When I took them out of the dryer they were all pilled a fuzzy. Lost a lot of fabric in washing. I was disapointed since I bought 4 sets. Cannot return now that I have washed them. I now use these as every day towels because soon they will thin enoughto be rags to wash my car with, POOR QUALITY!"
2,Crushing disappointment,"I bought this DVD in consolation of not being able to afford his forthcoming live tour 'downunder', which makes this review even more keenly felt.I agree with all the reviews about the video editing!Tragic- i don't know if i can ever watch this DVD again.I have ALL Vai's CD's and a G3 VHS but this one leaves me cold.I commend Vai's attempts at presenting an entertaining show but i'm surprised that the music has even left me nonchalant.For the first time ever i thought i was watching a gratuitous display of 'chops'.Maybe the visuals put me in a less receptive mood.Surely he didn't watch this before it was released.Mr. Vai can do MUCH better than this.Crushed."
5,Played a hundred times at home already....,"I bought this DVD for my 16 year old son, who loves rock music, and is driving me crazy cause he's playing it over and over every day. He likes the close-up on the electric guitar, which moves him to try to play along and the image is excellent.So, thumbs up for this DVD that was one of the birthday gifts he received and treasures."
2,Great guitarist and band but the video production is lame.,"I sorry but I'm amazed Vai released this crap.Choppy video production, mixing dv video and moviestyle footage during the concert. Not to mention the 1980'svideo effects.If you think this is a perfect video you'renot asking for much. I'm a big fan of Steve Vai but this DVDis a rip off. DO NOT BUY THIS DVD !"
1,Agree with the negative reviewers...,"I agree with the negative reviewers. This can opener is not worth the money, just for the name. Cheaply made and useless."
3,Only shows military time for me,"Just bought this clock after having a different Emerson Smartset model for 3+ years and loving it. Straight out of the box this clock will only show me military time and there are no instructions in my manual on how to switch it over to ""regular"" time. I have emailed Emerson for instructions on how to change it but if they don't respond quickly I will be returning the clock and getting a different model."
1,Pretty worthless in Arizona,"I think that they should state on the outside of the box the information about Arizona (and other areas) that do not observe DST. Thus, with this clock, we are required to reset the clock whenever DST goes in or out. I bought it for the power failure reset feature (not the DST feature).I purchased this clock because it has ""Smart Set."" I guess it's not too smart if I need to reset it when we don't even observe DST. Why wouldn't you have a ""non-DST"" time zone in the unit? Luckily I can return this unit easily. Great concept, just a tad weak in your execution--don't they ever give this to a consumer to try before they market it??."
3,Never Wave at a WAC,"""Never Wave at a WAC"" is a must for anyone who has ever served in the Women's Army Corps. Many of the women stationed at Ft. Lee when the film was made were extras in the movie; some had speaking roles. Many WAC Bandsmen were in the movie, which made it very nostalgic for me. The quality of the DVD left much to be desired; some of the VHS tapes are of better quality."
1,Awful,"I did not receive anything acording to the product description which matches the image of the item on sell. I only received a box with 4 black wheels in it, no wiring shelves. I feel absolutely cheated. I would not recommend that anyone invest in this because from my epxerience you will not receive what the image and product features and descriptions convey."
5,The Day Jesus the Christ Died,This is a wonderful addition to one's Bible Study library. It is a great book to understand the full impact the Christian Passover. I reread it yearly. It's really helps you understand the importance of Christ's sacrifice/crucifixion. The scriptures are in chronolgical order which gives you a clearer picture how the events of prophesy unfolded. I would also highly recommend The Harmony of the Gospels by the author.
5,"Magnificent, beautifully written tale of forbidden passion.","The God in Flight is one of the most intriguing, wellcrafted and beautifully written novels I've read in a verylong time. Erotic and extraordinary, Laura Argiri givesus a revealing look at the power of passion between twopeople. A passion so strong and undeniable that it managesto transcend the era's staunch Victorian sensibilities.A must read for lovers of Austen, Forster and Wilde."
1,Dead after 2 minutes,"Can't say much for the video or sound quality, menu options, or anything really, since this thing broke after 2 minutes of watching Monsters, Inc. on DVD. Playback just froze, the thing stopped recognizing that DVDs were in unless you turned the thing off and then back on again, and after another minute it wouldn't even start playing the thing at all, just whirred a lot.So, dud."
1,To long in Pionts,"Your book is to long per thought. Hard to read, and some of the words you used are not even in the dictionary."
1,A major disappointment.,"I made it to page 200 before giving up. At that point, I was still waiting for the action to begin! Entire battles and supposedly ""epic"" campaigns are never described, but are simply talked about as already having taken place! Hello?!? Narrative summary is no replacement for actual scenes! This book was very disappointing, especially since the first books of the Keltiad (Copper Crown, Throne of Scone) were quite good. I hope the author does not make this type of lazy writing a habit."
1,Disturbing plot lines.,"After reading some of the other reviews, I have a feeling that I would have been better served to have read something else by Kennealy-Morrison first. I have to agree that the characters and plot lines are poorly developed, but my biggest disappointment with this novel was the underlying tone of racism. The motivations behind the expulsion of the ""Incomers"" truly bothered and concerned me. I would definitely recommend against this being your first Kennealy-Morrison read."
5,Orpheus and Eurydice in Outer Space!,"While others who have reviewed this volume have complained about the personal, autobiographical element, it is my opinion that they are totally off the mark. Though the author has admitted, indeed, even boasts of, the honor she grants to her beloved husband, and uses their story to fuel this book (hey, she's a writer; that's what writers do...), she has transcended the personal and accessed the archetypal themes of love, loss and loyalty, betrayal and vengance. Among the author's works, it is her personal favorite, and in her opinion ""the best writing I have ever done."" It's a pity some readers cannot see past the lesser autobiographical connection to the grandeur of the mythic sweep beyond. After all, don't you think she would've challenged the gods for Jim if she could have? (...and don't you think she might have won?)"
2,Ugh...,"I bought this CD because it featured Dolly Parton on harmony, and its definately a good thing that I didnt buy it for the Larkins vocals. Tina Larkin's vocals resemble that of a chipmunk... Shaunna Larkin has a much better voice, but is only featured on two tracks. In short, only buy this album if you a die-hard Dolly Parton fan and must have all of her recordings."
2,Skip the first 200 pages,"Oh my goodness! We chose this for a book club book. It's a very hard read. It's difficult to get beyond the first 200 pages because the author delves into minutia. He is also a misogynist. By the end of the book, I couldn't stand James Agee."
1,One of the worst books I have ever read.,"I see no redeeming social value to Agee's poorly written, disjointed, and condescending dribble. He befriends a few weak and troubled families and projects them upon a whole people and then manages to betray the families and their trust in him even to the point of rifling through their meager possessions. I doubt that they would have done the same to him. If this is an American classic, I pity this country and those who judge its literature. And this judgement also applies to some of the Amazon reviewers of this ""book."""
3,A Puzzle to be piece together....,"James Agee's book on the sharecroppers of the American south during the great depression is a book not to be taken lightly. I read this book for a college english class and I can honestly say that most people in the course including myself are confused by Agee's intent and purpose. Agee's highly lyrical and philosophical tone allows a deep analysis into the question of human existence in the depression south. Yet, the very scope and difficulty of his subject is expressed in his confused, perhaps confusing writing. There are lonely moments of insight stacked alongside pages of seemingly irrelevant and baseless speculation. I say seemingly because each time I re-read the passage I find that Agee's words have quite a bit more meaning than I had originally found. This book is not a novel, not journalism but a puzzle which Agee could not piece together. Only with time and care can the reader hope to understand the frustratingly complex yet real message of Agee's work."
4,additional information,"Other reviewers have done a fine job describing this book. It is an often difficult (for several reasons) but I think important text that will be enjoyed by fans of history, sociology, literature, or art.I wanted to suggest two sites that have additional information that readers may enjoy and find valuable:The first is a 2005 article from Fortune (The Most Famous Story We Never Told) that follows up with Charles Burroughs (Burt Gudger)and Laura Minnie Lee Tengle (Flora Merry Lee Ricketts). It sheds some light on how the families perceived the assignment and book.The second is the Library of Congress FSA-OWI collection ([...]) from which Evans's photographs are taken. Do a search on Hale County, AL and you'll find several dozen photos of the families including more candids and more smiles."
1,Frustrating,"My problem with these disks is that they will record, and it will show that I have all the tracks I put on the disk, but it will only play a certain portion of what I recorded. My wife uses these disks for her cycle class at the gym and burned one this morning. She went to play it in her car on the the way and it only played about 30 seconds before skipping and going silent. This has been an ongoing problem with these disks and it's getting very frustrating. I just tried an old Sony disk I had on the shelf and am having no problems."
1,black cd r is a black hole,Would give it 0 stars if that were an option! It does not record in multiple recorders. A waste of time and money!
1,doesn't work well with Sony cd burner,"Form some reason these discs no longer work well with my burner. They did, at one time but as of late, do not. I wound up ordering Sony music cds."
4,"VERY comfortable, almost perfect, one small thing...","I love these shoes, especially the egg crate insoles. Its unbelievable how comfortable they are. The only thing I don't like is the metal clasp on the strap because its not a ""closed"" clasp. In the long run it may poke a hole in that piece of the strap which would be a shame because the shoes are well made and I'm expecting them to last a long time. Other than that, I'm thinking about buying another pair in another color!"
2,Who can stop in the middle of a series?,"OKay I'm hooked on these books and I have to know what happens in the next one. Ban-ya was the only reason I bought Shadow of the Watching Star. The only book that was even slightly happy was the first one, The Sacred stones, where I was compelled by Ta-maya and Masau's love and wondering what would happen to Dankan-eh, but can anyone make up their mind? Cha-kwena loves Mah-ree but he has to follow the white mammoth, to realize he loves her and must return, she means everything to him, for him to return, and he's mad at her again. And what about Kosar-eh he was the hideously scarred one-armed clown of the Red World, now he's a brave newly-healed hunter? Can we have some babies in a book where no one kills them because they were born when the tribe is mourning?! I can barely believe a woman wrote these books."
3,Don't they ever learn?,"How many times can the same mistakes be done by the same people in this set? Why do they keep falling for the tricks again? Even the characters seem to be tired of the story. This book plods along with a unsteady plot and strange twists and very few tied up loose ends.I found myself wanting to scream ""wise up already!""They also keep getting close to the new land and turning right around for whatever reason and starting it all over again. This is supposed to be a series about Paleo-Indians comming into the new land, but they haven't even gotten to it yet.Not one of her best but not her worst."
2,Not so good,"It took a very long time for me to receive this product from the seller. The quality was not what I expected, and I hit purchase before seeing what the shipping charges were. Buyer beware."
5,Perfect companion for belt extender.,"Used this to cover the hardware on this belt extender:UNIVERSAL CAR SEAT BELT EXTENDERMade the whole installation look factory and keeps the bolt from scratching the seat trim. If you want to use it to cushion the belt on your shoulder, it should work well for that, too, since the foam in it feels very soft and the cover feels like very supple leather."
5,a great pattern book,I was so excited when I received this book. There are lots of wonderful patterns to do. It is in my opinion the best bead book I have found so far. thank you...
2,OXO 1068279 Good Grips Adjustble Gardening Hand Rake,"The problem is probably mine...I misunderstood ""Hand Rake"". I wanted an adjustable rake that I didn't have to bend over to use. I like the way the blades spread from small to wide, just what I was looking for to replace my very old rake that had worn itself to a ""just right"" width over time (some of the blades had broken off). I've kept the rake because the postage to send it back would have almost cost the price of the Hand Rake."
4,review,"I love the soft leather! I also like all the family record pages. I wish the letters were just a tad larger, but otherwise, it is perfect."
2,history of Nova Scotia,This is a nice book but written too long ago and difficult to read. I bought it for my 82 year old mother who's family is from NS and she just wasn't happy with it from page 1...so i returned it. Thanks
4,Captivating study of the advantages,"of presenting drama in a radio format. This book examines plays by the mentioned playwrights that couldn't have achieved the same effects on stage. For example, a play exploring the mind of a woman who's had a stroke (we can't ""see"" what's real beyond what she tells us). Very thought-provoking. My main--really only--quibble with the text is that after lamenting that these radio plays are seldom heard/soon forgotten/underappreciated, the author neglects to include even one script. Bit of a tease, in my opinion."
4,You can't go wrong,"Some time before the ""great herb"" rush, I purchased this book to use for combatting a few bodily irregularities. I loved and have often referred back to it over the years. The cross-referencing of the book is good. You can look for a specific herb (as this section is alphabetized) or you can look for a specific ailment.The only portions I was a little disappointed with were the section pertaining to formulas; I think there should have been one for each ailment in the book (and this section should've followed the ailment sections and not the herb section). Additionally, I think the section listing which herbs contained which vitamin should've also shown what each vitamin is known to do for the body.Otherwise, this is one of those books you won't ever loan (because you'll never see it again)."
5,And every mother needs this book...,Have used this book since it was first published. Excellent book on basic medicinal herb use in the home.
2,Crazy Horse in Heaven,"I bought this book by mistake, thinking it was a book called Crazy Horse, a new novel by another author. I read it anyway. Whew! This is not a good book. The situation in this novel is so far out that I couldn't figure out what was happenning. I think if I had to sum up a review in one sentence, it would be: I don't get it! Crazy Horse in Heaven is hard to follow. I really didn't like the writing style. It kinda had no rythm to it, just sort of plowing along without any real end in sight. The bits of poetry were pretty good. All in all, I'd say pass on this one. Not worth the price. I would reccomend the other Crazy Horse by McMurty, I think. Now that's a good book."
4,As seen on TV,Little new is brought to the table regarding the Strike Team and their co-workers but I still enjoyed the book none-the-less.
1,Deceptive product description. Not made by Hewlett Packard. Battery only. No Travel Pack.,The item's product description is wrong. It is not the HP Travel Pack with battery. Only a non-OEM battery by Premium Power Products.
1,Did anybody edit/read this thing before it was printed?,"Pretty disappointing. With all due respect to the author, who may well have been too busy to see to little details, or who may be the victim of a bad editor, I had to buy this for a class, and it must be amoung the worst textbooks I've seen. It switches levels from elementary to advanced at random, leaves out important equations and includes a lot of things beyond the scope of the book (in the sense that you'd need a different book to act as a bridge between the easy and advanced sections of this one.) Not even very good for a reference book given the spotty coverage."
5,I love this book!!!,"This book was my lifeline when I took Biochemistry this past year. Everything is logically organized and the chapters are easy to read and quick to comprehend. The level of detail provided is perfect for an undergraduate level biochemistry course. The diagrams, while simplistic, are easy to understand and remember for use on exams. The only drawback might be a failure to integrate all the different metabolic pathways, but this is a shortcoming found in many textbooks."
1,crap,"This purse is crap. The leather is awful and feels fake. The lining inside the purse was torn away at the seam when I opened the packaging. It's quality is so poor, I'd be embarassed to carry this bag. Don't waste your money on this one. I would give it zero stars, but this program won't allow that as an option."
5,c'mon people: ever heard of this guy? yeah? why not review h,not a compilation so that's BIG on originality. the music is just as good though!! this guy is big in house and you know it. this a favourite in my collection of house tracks for disco nights. forget all that fancy vynil and turntables. buy a cdj and spin cds. much easier especially if you have one of these great cds. BUY NOW!!
5,Incredible trance journey,"Track 1 is a nice start, but tame compared to tracks 2 thru 6.Tracks 2 thru are 6 are truly epic trance music. They represent the best string of trance tracks I have ever heard. This CD does not get old and it will really pump you up for a night out. The other tracks are OK, towards the end the CD gets stronger again, but purely on the basis of # 2-6 this CD gets 5 stars. I stopped listening to techno music for about 4 or 5 years but this CD got me hooked on it again."
5,Works Great,A little of this goes a very long way. I got it to help detox my body and can attest that it really does work. I would order this again.
1,No difference,"I read the review about this, it doesn't taste bitter, it tastes sweet and have consistency like corn syrup. it's winter and we all got sick still using this in our everyday drinking water"
5,Can't sing enough praises for GSE,"No medicine cabinet should be withoutNutribiotic - GSE Liquid Concentrate, 2 fl oz, natures antibiotic! This stuff is amazing, and I tell everyone I meet how well it's worked for me. I use it to ward off colds and infections, as a toothbrush sanitizer, to disinfect my cutting boards and dishwasher, even as a rinse for vegies and fruit. I tried it as a facial cleanser and found it a bit too harsh, but GSE works fine as a gargle when the throat is sore."
2,Difficult to get the plug out,"It is very difficult to get the plugs out. I have to use a dead-blow hammer to eject the plugs unless the ground if very wet and then all you do is pick up a glob of mud. I couldn't recommend it, but haven't found anything better."
1,Not good for Bermuda Grass,"The product is well built but doesn't work very well on Bermuda grass, the soil must be very loose or wet for it to cut."
5,A must read for religious history buffs,"Superb review of the Catholic church and its dealings in eastern Canada and the Illinois/Michigan area in the last century, including seldom discussed details of the Abraham Lincoln assassination. The incredible story of a priest's desire to remain in the Roman Catholic church and the choices he was faced with as he came up against the church hierarchy. A real eye-opener, and hard to put down. If you start it, make sure you have time to finish it."
2,Didn't work for my intended use,"This item is advertised as a speaker and headphone splitter. I have a small speaker unit that I use to listen to an HD radio and a pc. I wanted to keep both connected without having to keep switching the cables. What I found was that while two different items were plugged in, only one side would play as it should. One side would come out as a whisper of sound, even at full volume. (Of course, the unit not being used was powered off.) If I removed one plugged in item, the other side would then play properly. So, in effect, I'm having to still disconnect one item every time, which is pretty much the same as switching cables. I have had other splitters which worked fine in this setup, so I'm not sure if this item is defective, or, if in fact it is only meant as a headphone splitter, and not to be used for multiple devices. Didn't work for my intended purpose."
4,very underrated tune,I liked how he used the gap band samp;le here classic track that proves old school hip hop was the best.
2,Not a great camera,"This camera takes beautiful pictures in perfect light. I have no complaints about the pictures that I took outside. They were very clear and bright. But, if there isn't perfect light, the pics showed up extremely grainy. The pictures that I took inside my house came up so grainy, that they looked like they were taken from a disposable camera. I have since returned this camera."
3,miss the viewfinder,"As a 50 something buyer who needs reading glasses only, a wiewfinder would facilitate my photography skills. This is a nice litte camera, add a viewfinder, and it would be perfect."
1,Boring rubbish,"I'm forced to read this book for an American History class that I'm taking, and, although the stuff inside seems fairly accurate, it can be INCREDIBLY boring. So, if you are one of those weirdos who likes watching paint dry, go ahead and buy the book."
1,Poorly Organized!,"I looked at this Thesaurus while visiting a relative. I was writing a review on Amazon and I wanted to find some interesting words that meant the same thing as I was tired of using the same old words, well I didn't like her thesaurus at all, I own a different thesaurus from another publishing company and it is so much better then this one, this one is poorly organized which makes it a little confusing and it was difficult to find the words I was looking for so I said the heck with it and gave up and put it back on her book case and when I come back to visit I will bring my Theasaurus."
5,I'm so glad they still make these!,"Like other reviewers, I remember having one of these when I was a child. My only complaint with the current version is that it is made of plastic. I think mine was made of wood. However, I enjoyed giving the corn popper to my daughter on her first birthday, and she is having as much fun with it as I remember having."
1,Disappointed,I purchased 2 of these toys for twins but was very disappointed in them. Sometimes they worked in a forward motion and sometimes only when rolled backwards and they did need pressure put on them for the balls to pop. Definately not for the under 2 year olds. If an adult was working it then it was enjoyed but otherwise there was no interest.
2,blah...,"I thought this would be an old classic toy my daughter could play with.. well, it wasn't very impressive! The wheels are so hard to turn that it doesn't 'pop' when she pushes it!"
1,Good toy but used and damaged,"I bought this toy as a gift for a one year old birthday party. The toy itself is one that most children seem to love. Unfortunately it was sold as ""new"" and was actually ""used"". The plastic that holds the balls was gouged as if a child ran it into something and the wheels were scratched from using it on the floor. I was so busy before the party, I didn't take a good look at it until I put it in a gift bag just before I walked out the door! I was so embarrassed to say the least. I explained to the mom the situation but her son loved the toy, so she just kept it as is. This made me never want to buy a gift online again...at least at the last minute!"
2,Not a favorite in our household.,"For the most part, this toy just sits in the corner of my kids play room collecting dust. My daughter received this as a gift for her first birthday. She is now three. She has played with it maybe a dozen times in all that time."
4,Brings back memories.,My niece and son got this toy for Christmas and they love it it. I remember having this toy when I was little and that's why I bought it for them.
4,Popper,Our son loves this toy. He is constantly pushing it around the house and yard. We are glad we purchased this. It also takes quite a beating and still works just fine.
5,great toy!,"I got this for my 1 old hoping it would help him start walking by himself, and he loves the popping heck out of it. It's very colorful and fun. I would totally recommend it. Great toy!"
4,My son loves this toy,"My son got this toy for his 1st birthday and pretty much hasn't put it down for the past 3 months. It is LOUD and occasionally he gets the bright idea to bang it agains the wall or our heating/ac unit. However, I am forced to rate this highly because it is the only toy that he plays with consistently. I just wish he'd take to something quiet and educational like his blocks!"
1,Fisher-Price Brilliant Basics Corn Popper Push Toy,Fisher-Price Brilliant Basics Corn Popper Push Toy- Is a great toy but arrived broken. I asked for a return on this item more than 10 days ago and have not yet a return form.
3,Not too impressed,"While the zoom is great, the main problem is that a lot of light is required to see the image at x40 upto x80. Also, at these zoom levels, you really need a tripod as every little shake does affect the viewing very bad. So while it's great for sports when you are sitting in the nose bleed seats, it's not easy to get the tripod into the stadium."
3,Good but not good with zoom,This is good binocular but donot use for the zoom. Zoom is not good. It is enough powerful with 20x.
4,Good book for every family related question,"Covers a wide range of topics and gives some enlightening information to some old questions about parenting, family and emotional developement."
4,Read it before you tackle your own logo design.,"A great book to put you in ""the mood"" for logo design. ""Power of Logos"" walks you through a number of interesting questions that you'll want to consider before designing a logo.Many of the examples are peculiar to Hawaii but that is interesting too!Not sure logos are important for you? Four letters: ""N...I...K...E."""
3,Too thin!,I'm a big fan of the Tuli's Heavy Duty Gel Heel Cups so I decided to give this a try & bought a pair from Amazon. It's thinner & flimsier than what I expected. Was actually contemplating of using 2 sets to get the comfort effect I was expecting or pair a set with my Heavy Duty Gel Heel Cups.
5,beautiful book,I got this book for my daughter. She loves it. It is one of the best children poetry books in Spanish. Gloria Fuertes was the best children writers of all times in Spain. I love her work and I will always remmember her how unique and funny she was.
5,Funny movie!,"Everyone knows that the movies M.Culkin did as a kid were very funny, and this one is no different. I recommend this movie to all M.Culkin fans. (P.S.: I wish I could live in the lifestyle depicted in this movie, even with as packed as my schedule'd be.)"
1,UNBOUGHT ITEM,"I HAVE NOT BOUGHT THIS ITEM, SO I CAN NOT GIVE AN HONEST REVIEW. I AM SURE IT IS A GOOD ITEM, BUT I DO NOT HAVE IT"
4,entertaining,"Good movie for kids and adults alike. All the actore, including the dog play their characters well. A movie that the whole family can enjoy together."
4,Enjoyable Movie For Teens & Adults,"This is definitely teen fare, but it's very entertaining which means adults would get a lot of laughs out of it.There were a number of sight gags, things that made me laugh out loud, such as dollar signs instead of spots on the dog, the dress-ware of the little rich kid (Macauley Culkin), the eccentric characters - good and bad guys - are all fun to watch. I thought Jonathan Hyde, as the butler, stole the show.As with any comedy, some of the stuff is really stupid and some of it is really funny. Along the way, you get a few swear words that you wouldn't want your little ones to hear, but overall, I have little to criticize with this one."
4,A Parable,"I think this is really a cute movie for families. I like the contrast that is given between the ""villain"" and Richie's parents. After all, their true treasures WERE in that mountain vault, because they valued their sentimental family memories over material wealth. I believe that is a good message to send to kids, but very few Hollywood films portray that. Richie Rich shows a family who ""has everything"" with the real emphasis on the relationship between the family members, especially father and son."
4,old skool bass,"what!!! this cd brought back many memories a must have if u like the old skool deep, hard bass careful it might blow your subs!"
3,too small,"I really like Clic glasses. I have two pair. I give them for gifts. They are perfect for the outdoorsman, the handy man, the guy who works, and they are professional looking as well. But, most are too small for us larger guys. The headset needs a bit more room, length is ok, width is a problem. The glasses are great, just too tight. mike"
3,Too Small!,"As others have pointed out, these glasses are way too small. They seem well enough made, but there's no way I can wear them, not even close. I was going to return them but they fit my wife so gave them to her. And other than my wife occasionally thinking I'm a fathead, I'm pretty normal...I wear normal size hats with no problem. So unless your head is small, I have to say pass on these...."
4,Best pair of reading glasses one's could ever own,"Very convenient reading glasses. You could hang them on your neck when not using them, and not even notice they are there. They are very sturdy, and are flexible making them almost imposible to break.Cons: Both sets I purchased I notice them to be on the narrow side. They sometimes can feel too tight to the side of your face.The glasses are also not practicable to wear for a person with long hair, as the glasses would trap your hair against your face."
1,Buyer beware,"I bought this sofrware in hopes it would help in finding addresses and streets. When I went to install it on both of my computers,it was looking for a file I can not locate. It will not install to any computer I tried it on. You are wasting your money of you buy this software. I ask for my money back and I did get a refund in full. I tried thier web sight and I is no longer in use to this day. I went a bought from Delmore and have not had a bit of trouble."
2,no perks!!!!!!,to many black and white pictures!!!!!!!!!!!!book would be better with ALL COLOR pictures to illustrate levels of color?????
4,Far better than Norton Ghost 9,After removing Symantec's garbage from my computer I decided to give ATI a try. Installation went flawlessly. The software has worked without a problem so far. It recognizes my external firewire drive (Norton Ghost did not). It DOES support CD-R. Made a bootable CD and it works as advertised. So far I am very happy. This package has saved me once already from having to re-install Winblows XP.Recommended. I give this 4 instead of 5 stars as I cannot yet comment on their techsupport. Although that cant possibly be worse than Symantec's.
5,Exactly as described.,"This is a a very nice looking bucket with an attractive wooden handle. Plus they throw shovel in to boot.It was purchased to hold pellets for our stove. It will not hold a 40 pound bag, but enough to stoke the stove for the night if low. Just right for us.Also, if you had a wood stove it would work well for paper, kindling, starter, matches or when you need to scoop out ashes etc. Being metal with a sturdy handle it is perfect.I would recommend as it is sturdy and attractive."
5,"Suspenseful and at the same time , frightening","From the opening chapter to the exciting conclusion, this was a book you couldn't put down. It's ironic that there are so many books being written about the office of the presidency at a time the present occupant of the White House so many alleged scandals brewing. That's why I find this story a bit unnerving. As they say...""Sometimes, more often than not, fiction is stranger than fact"".My name is...Antonio DiBenedetto, 80 Hanover St., Fall River, MA 02720-5224.p.s. The movie version of Absolute Power pretty much follows the book storyline with a few changes but they do not detract from the story"
2,Absoulte Garbage,"Absolute Power starts off very strongly, but degenerates into a series of improbabilities that made me start skipping pages three at a time toward the end. Why would Luther NOT tell the cops or the main character what happened? Why would the main character NOT go to the cops, instead running around like a chicken with its head cut off? Why would the cops bust in to save the main character's life JUST as he is about to get killed? ARGHHH it's so annoying. Come on Baldacci, you can write better stuff than this garbage."
5,"Once read very good, Second time better","I remember when a Fellow Elk introduced me to his nephew, David and handed me an advance copy of this book. It had been a long time since I had read a book in a single sitting, for many reasons, but this time I could not put it down. It was the beginning of a long relationship.I went on reading with the last man standing and lo & behold, a new character was born out the Nam Era, Oliver Stone.I never could understand where the ""Camel Club"" name came from, but I beleive that no other could fit. It was a new adventure and every book was as good or better than the one before.I can't remember any of his books that I cannot talk good about it."
3,So. So,"Mostly a manic run through the characters, fairly unbelievable. The attempted intensity of the scenes is created by the use of overblown adjectives and not through descriptive writing."
4,Read the book but don't see the movie.,"I'm sure Clint Eastwood acts his heart out as Luther in Absolute Power, but I don't want to see the movie. From the book's first page you are immersed in Luther's private and oddly honorable world of thievery. The author pulls you by the collar through the story and won't let you go, at least not until four-fifths of the way through the book. That's where the biggest shocker of this shock-loaded novel sets in. That's where you pray the movie producer changed the storyline. I don't know if he did, so I'll stick with my memory of Baldacci's compelling writing and leave the film watching to movie buffs"
1,"Absolute Power, Absolute Crap -- What's the difference, eh?","Can the Pres get away with murder? Why the hell not -- the publisher got away with raping the people who bought this dreck, didn't he? Space and time restrictions (plus the fact that I just ate) prevent me from detailing why I found this book so offensive, so we'll just deal with these highly developed characters my fellow reviewers found so appealing -- a combination of inhumanly beautiful billionaires who are also idealistic, crackerjack attorneys. The only thing highly developed about them was their physiques -- his ""rock hard"" wrestler's body, her balloon like breasts etc., to which we are treated many descriptions of. How about that thief, who steals ONLY from the rich and then literally gives the booty away? CHECK THE BOOK, I AM NOT MAKING THIS UP. The creepiest part, though, was finding out that Baldacci is an attorney and former high school wrestler himself"
4,Super tale of the potential misuse of power in Washington,"A tale that will both surprise and scare you.The President of this country has a lot of people, powerand resources at his/her disposal; read this book and findout how far it can go! Also - Jack Graham is a great fantasyfor any woman reader!"
2,A good beach read perhaps,"A ""timely"" plot in light of the recent goings-on in DC. However, the writing is very poor and the characters are flat and uninteresting. A good mindless beach read, but don't expect too much."
3,Good old fashioned campy pirate flick,"This is a good old fashioned pirate movie of the type that teenage boys enjoyed at Saturday matinees about sixty years ago. In brief, it is a pleasurable ""popcorn chomper"" which is not to be taken too seriously. Naturally it has no relationship whatsoever to actual historical events.The only really preposterous plot element is when Captain Kidd and his trusty sidekick sail the ship by themselves! In reality this would have required a minimum of two watches of twenty men each.Sound and video quality are decent. As noted by a previous reviewer this is a b&w; print of a color movie. The color process used was an inferior (and cheaper) alternative to Technicolor, so going for a b&w; version may have been a wise move."
3,Silver-Tongued Devil Strikes it Rich,"When the time comes ya gotta get drunk and cry about how bad life sucks, ain't nobody better to listen to."
3,Good book but.......,"Well, this is the first book I've ever read by this author-indeed I don't know if he's written any more. While the book was, in general, well written, it was a little complex. What I mean is this: at 520+ pages and more characters than you could shake a stick at, at times I found myself having to backtrack to figure out what was going on or why something had happened. If it weren't for this fact, I'd give the book four stars but because the same story could have been told in about 100 fewer pages without losing anything, I can give it no more than three."
4,Review,It was a very detailed and thorough book. I would reccomend this book to others who are considering self publishing.
2,disappointed,"Although there is useful information throughout, the book appears quite dated. This author still refers to such technological ""wonders"" as the fax machine and, god forbid, the yellow pages, and seems never to have heard of the internet. I really expected more cutting-edge, up to date, information."
4,a great trip,"Ultimately a chick flick, but not much that it's sugar-coated. The bond that develops between the 3 main characters is truly beautiful and inspiring. This film will make you both laugh and cry, a a rare quality. See it."
3,Decent Enough but Not Interesting,"I got this one as a gift and already had the corn popper one at home. My kids all love the corn popper, so I thought this would be a big hit too. It was but only for a few minutes. The little ""melody"" is repetative and annoying to me and my 4-year-old wasn't thrilled either. My 2-year-old just wasn't interested but expressed no reason. They prefer to play with the corn popper and ignore this. My advice is to buy that instead. This is also metal so dents if a child runs it into anything, which small children are likely to do. Mine has a huge dent now after only one run into a toy box. This isn't a terrible toy, but there are better substitutes for the same money."
5,Surprise!,"I bought this toy during a trip out of town because it was relatively inexpensive and not too loud to annoy Nana and Papa. Surprise! My 8 month old boy loved it so much we had to bring it home (it was supposed to stay at their house for the next trip.) He is now 12 months old, and this is still the most used toy in his room.... and there are LOTS to choose from! I absolutely love that they used the chime sounds instead of the popping balls. Ours has been inside, outside, dunked in the kiddie pool, left in the rain, used to ""beat up"" the porch, and generally anything else a boy can think to do with it. It is now dented and the the wrapper with the design on it (the blue part) is bubbling from the water damage... but the toy keeps going! If, somehow, he does manage to break it before he's out of the push-toy stage, I will DEFINITELY buy another.Hooray for this one!"
1,Item was cancelled,I am not able to review this product because I never received it. It was cancelled by Amazon and I was not given the reason.
1,1 word crap,this is crapno good episodes at all in this the only 1 that was worth seeing was dungeon dice monsters i am the biggest fan ever but still i hate that they deleted a whole season and other parts the japenese names are better but its still good i like season 2 3 and 4 but i hate the music the japenese showing was alot better this is not worth buying because you have to pay 100 somthing dollars for crap man thats a rip off so dont get it.
3,awwwww cmon people,who in their right mind is gonna pay 1999.99$ for a small seasonal boxset. You people will never sell this.
3,Ugh...,"Okay, I personally don't like this idea. But that's just me not liking what the 4Kids or whatever company did to Yu-Gi-Oh.If you do like the dubbed version, then by all means, go ahead and buy this. However, I recommend the original, uncut Japanese version more. If you look around on the net, I'm sure you can find it somewhere. Some anime stores even have them.If you choose to go ahead and buy the dubbed, just know that most of the scenes and any plot at all were taken, sliced up, sugar-coated, fluffed up, and then shown. There are very few scenes like they were in the original."
1,worse anime adaptation of a manga EVER.,"this show is PURELY an advertisement to sell cards, and the first season of the show is probobly the biggest example of this. the drag on the duels for far too long, and throw in lame lines such as ""you must use the heart of the cards to win"".HEART OF THE CARDS????? what kinda lame ass thing is THAT???this anime is in NO way a faithfull adaptation to kazuki takahashi's manga. read the manga, trust me, its actually pretty cool. much better then this sad excuse for a show.oh, and for those ""sub fans"", ive seen the japanese version of the show too. ALL it has that the english version does not is more blood and swearing. THATS IT. it still has the same lame plot, and the crappy animation. and Bakura sounds like a freakin girl in the japanese version. so its even CRAPPIER than the english.p.s. all shows that are made to sell merchandise (i.e. yu-gi-oh, pokemon, transformers, etc) (...). if u want REALY anime, go watch escaflowne, gundam wing, or trigun."
4,Caedmon's Call,"I recently went to a Caedmon's Call/Jars of Clay concert with my youth group and absolutely loved them. When I got home, I bought all the cds that they had played songs off of. This cd is awesome & truly captures their words and their meaning."
5,Awesome Praise and Worship Album!,"I went to see Caedmon's Call in concert from this album's tour. I had heard a few of their songs before, but since seeing them in concert, I am blown away. This is a great praise and worship CD. Every song has a significant meaning and value. Without a doubt, this is a good ""investment"" for those who enjoy good Christian praise songs. Awesome!"
5,"not quite classic Caedmon's, but not necessarily a bad thing","as most have observed already, this is not like other Caedmon's albums.it seems to sound a lot like recent albums (LLOL, 40 Acres, as others have noted), and less like older stuff, like My Calm//Your Storm, or even the self-titled. a bit more produced, more effects.not much to add to what others have said lyrically. it's still great. Josh even rings in with a song or two of his own :) they're starting him young :) it's a good thing you don't need much life experience to write about the Creator of the universe - just a reconciled grateful heart."
2,good until they snapped!,My 14 yo daughter liked these very much until they snapped. She used them for 4 months (and is usually very carefully with her things) until the plastic headband broke when she was putting them on. It wasn't the center hinge that broke it was the end of the top headband right after the padding ended. The headphones do seem narrow/tight in the width. My daughter also mentioned that they would start to hurt her ears after wearing them for an extended period of time...after a couple of hours. Skullcandy offers a pretty good sounding warranty on their website. I will try that and let you know what happens.
1,easily breakable,"I have bought two of these headphones in six months and both have broken. The second time, I knew I had to be careful and barely pulled them apart and they snapped. The plastic part that moves in and out has no strength what-so-ever. I highly recommend getting something more durable, and I will not be buying anything from skullcandy anytime soon."
4,"If you are prone to breaking things, buy a sturdier set.","I absolutely loved the style, look, and sound from these headphones. I love Skullcandy headphones and always buy from them. However, I only had these headphones for a month or two before I snapped them just by taking them off. My boyfriend surprised me with the same pair a month later (knowing how much I love them) but I managed to snap those (also just by taking them off) within a month. I love these headphones and recommend them 100% unless you are prone to breaking things, are unintentionally rough or do not want to baby your headphones. I returned both pairs to skullcandy and was given more than enough store credit to purchase a bigger, more durable set that was perfect for me, as well as a pair of ear buds. I am very pleased with Skullcandy. They have warranty for life on all of their products and their products are EXCELLENT. If I ever need headphones again I will definitely buy from them."
1,They were broken,They were broken but good and fast seller's service refunding my money back. One of the headphones didn't work.
1,Horrible Headphones,Uncomfortable and a bit painful to wear. Sound quality is what I would consider poor but kids and other people who are relatively new for using headphones might say it sound quality is normal. I bought because the other positive reviews but wish I had not. With the list price being $34-$45 I assumed that they would have some quality to them. But it's all cheep plastic hiding behind a brand. If you asked me in a blind test to try out the headphones and asked me what I thought the retail value would be I'd guess $5.I would recommend not purchasing these headphones.
2,Too Bad,"Unfortunately, we had to return these headphones. My daughter, who does not have a large head, found that they were too tight on her ears, and since they sit on the ears rather than encompass them, this mattered greatly. Also, after turning them up, as she said, not too much, she heard a crackly sound along with the music. Disappointing, since they were very cute."
4,4/5 stars,"Great bag. Plenty of storage areas, professional looking bag. Only issue I can see is the bag, unless counterbalanced, falls to the front."
2,Worked well but did not last long.,I purchased the ECOTACO 3.0 pen scanner and worked well. I only used it for scanning the English language. Had the device for 3 months but only used it for 6-8 times for about an hour duration. The light started flickering and device stopped working. Not worth the price if stops working with limited use.
4,Not perfect...but it works.,"I gotta admit it does make some mistakes, but it is a lot easier to use this product than to have to write evrything out."
3,Ectaco C-Pen 20 Handheld Scanner,"In comparison to the alternative of having to retype the research myself, this pen is a handy tool. It's easily portable and does save me precious time; however, there are a number of aspects that could be improved. It is slow; scanned materials can only be done in short chunks; each line needs to be edited to ensure completeness; sections often need to be repeated; during scanning, the light, at times, will short out, requiring repetition. Like I said, it's a handy tool, but it's often frustrating to use, and has not proved to be smooth and easy scanning. [[ASIN:B000EOMZO6 Ectaco C-Pen 20 Handheld Scanner]"
1,Junk,"With all the glowing reviews, I bought this thing to help me with my PhD work. Turns out the thing is just junk. Barely reads anything from your average book and stops half-way through most sentences. Really bad. And I'm pretty technically savvy so I don't think it's me."
5,THIS CD IS INCREDIBLE.......,"Dianne Schuur has always been one of my favorites. There is no doubt the woman has a fabulous voice! I have been very fortunate to have seen her perform several times. However, I must say the combination of Schuur and Ferguson is just pure joy to listen to. There is an incredible version of Besame Mucho on this CD. If anyone out there is looking to buy a really great CD, this is the one!"
2,Rhythmically Challenged,"Rarely have I looked so forward to a new album as this one. The song selection was interesting. Maynard Ferguson was at his swingin' best, but Diane Schuur was just off the mark. She hits all the notes, make no mistake about that. And her soaring trumpet mimicing scat singing counterpointed against the band was reminiscent of the better moments of Ella and Sarah. But it sounds like the band recorded in New York and she over-layed in Los Angeles...or something like that. She and the band were on two separate projects if not at least different wavelengths. Where's her sense of rhythm? Nowhere to be found."
5,Great Big Band/Vocal Album,"Sultry piano trio jazz this ain't. Perhaps the thrill of Big Brass is an acquired taste these days. I know people who will happily sit and listen to Korn, but claim that Stan Kenton hurts their ears. But, this is a great old time big band record, big and brassy (gosh Modern Jazz is over 50 years old!) like something Kenton (MF's old boss) might've cooked up if he had a singer with chops like Diane Shuur's. All the ""screaming"" is under control and the high notes are all tastfully distributed. Somehow, I suspect that this is the first time that Shuur has had an opportunity to use her 4 octave range to it's fullest, and I hope she continues to work with Maynard Ferguson. He plainly knows how to treat a good singer."
3,Easy-to-use intro to Gramma's home medicines,"This book is organized in two ways - by plant and by symptom.By plant you can see the different uses for each herb, and by symptom you look up your health issue and you can then decide which treament best suits you (maybe depending on what you've got on hand..).It also has a handy explanation of the various ways plants are treated to make the best use of them. This book is on my shelf, always at hand. Many times I've used cough and stomach rememdies from it, and many times I felt better just knowing I was treating my kids with natural sources and putting alittle limit on the chemicals."
3,Stop already.,"Okay I rented this movie and I asked myself what I was thinking. I have seen all of the movies and even own the 4th one, but they need to stop making bad, stupid, and not even scary movies.The movie wasnt that super bad, but I would only watch it once. If you are a fan of the series then buy it, otherwise just rent it and spend the money you saved on something good."
5,"""The Small One"" will always be in my heart","I loved this movie the first time I saw it. It still makes me cry when I even read about it. I first though I was the only one who felt this way, now I've realized that it's touched many people's heart."
5,Memories from childhood,Watching this video brought back so many memories from my childhood. I remember watching this short feature before a full length Disney movie. I've been wanting to get this for so long and I just couldn't find it. This is a video that I will cherish and my kids will cherish in the future. Disney brings a true feeling of Christmas giving through this video.
5,Works just fine!,"Picked up one of these a couple of months ago, before purchasing my HD TV. TV arrived, PS3 was connected with this cable, everything worked perfectly. The only reason I'm considering purchasing a different brand next time is that I've realized it would be nice to have all the cables behind the TV in black, so as they blend in better."
5,Ms. Chrissie remixed by Junior.,"This follows in the line of non dance acts doing club remixes to either jump start a failing career or a expansion of the form of music they want to do-- take your pick. Following Jewel,Duncan Sheik,Bette Midler,Linda Eder,Stevie Nicks and now you can add The Pretenders to that list. This is the remixes for the song ""Time"" and they are remixed by Junior Vasquez in a 7 remix set. The remixes are not typical Junior mixes in that they are more trance/laid back in the feel of the music. Most of the mixes are the same in sound and feel so choose which one you like the most. Tracks are:Radio Mix(3:30),Mixshow(6:40),Earth Anthem(10:09),Ambient Mix(6:09),Earth Beats(6:40),Tribapella(6:40),Earthstrumental(10:09) and the funky album version(3:59). It is weird for the hard rock vocals of Chrissie Hynde to work so well with the house beats of this mix. I guess just hearing Chrissie Hynde sing is enough for any song."
5,Lessons of Life for the Teachable,"If I can use one or two principles from a book that can be applied to mybusiness, I feel that it's well worth the purchase price of the book.This book was a real bargain for me because I have paid five times the purchase from other books and not glean the harvest I did from this book.I liked how the author was transparent by sharing his failures and the lessons he learned from those experiences that will help others not follow these same pitfalls. The book is filled with applications that are in the arena of the real world that I found helpful."
4,Looking for a 70 amp breaker?,"Well, I did all the work of wiring my new workshop with wiring that would support 70 amps; but, then it turned out that Home Depot and Lowes only carry 60 or 100 amp breakers for the Cutler Hammer box that supplies my house.Fortunately, Amazon carries this 70-amp 2-pole breaker - and it fit perfectly into the electrical supply box.Although this product functions perfectly, I'm docking a star simply because of the price. The breakers that are available locally are literally about half the price as of the time I'm writing this review. I probably should have driven to an electrical supply store to see if they have one in stock - but Amazon is just so convenient..."
5,How to be a vampire,"Andrew Griffin likes Werewolves, Mummies and Vampires. One day, under his bed he finds a book called ''HOW TO BE A VAMPIRE"". One day he tried to eat garlic. One day he also had bite marks in his neck.Not that Andrew minds turning into a vampire, he can scare his sister, COOL!.Now Andrew meets his vampire teacher. The vampire teacher was really scary.But Andrew is not yet ready to sleep in a coffin or drink someone's blood right?"
5,Roachford CD,Product was exactly as described and delivery was trouble-free. I saw Roachford at the University of Warwick in the 80s and this CD has all of my favourite songs.
1,Who are these women?,"Surely these are not the same two women I've listened to, supported and loved (separately) for over thirty years! There is only one song out of twelve where they actually do hamonize well but I cannot tell you which one it is because I cannot force myself to listen again. I am not one to put my opinions all over the universe for others to suffer through but in this case I had to share. Do yourself a favor and pass this one by."
5,Great neutral rug,"I received the rug with the orange border and absolutely LOVE it! I read all of the reviews before I ordered it and was very nervous about what it would look like, but it looks great in the nursery. I am not using one set bedding for my nursery but more of an overall jungle theme so this rug is the only piece I have from this set. Like I said before, I love it, I think it looks great in the nursery and with the orange border, it doesn't have SO MUCH BLUE!"
5,The Funky Bunch has arrived!,"Here's a group that can kick out a funk-jazz instumental (Machine Gun), a booty-shakin' jam (Brick House), a laid-back mood-maker (Zoom), and a heart-felt ballad (Three Times A Lady), quicker than it takes prunes to work! The legacy of the Commodores will always be made to last, thanks to the hard work of the members and the fans who will continue to love them. This 2 disc set will carry any fan out of their mind and introduce new listeners to what made a funky beat bounce and what made love more meaningful. This collection is a must-have for any serious collector interested in have one of music's most spirited groups sitting on their racks and either disc in their player."
5,The best sofar...,"This is a thoroughly documented work; the most scholarly I've read sofar on the topic of Islam.Yet ,at the same time,it is most readable for the average reader."
5,Best Book on Islam Out There,"This book is so important. It provides a clear explanation of Islam, Mohammed, the theology and history. After reading it, you will finally understand the disconnect between Western perceptions (based on tolerance) and Muslims celebrating with joy at the news of a suicide bomber blowing up children on a school bus, and the Muslim father talking glowingly how proud he is of his suicide bomber son. The reason for the joy is that these people have been taught for centuries (and believe) that killing non-muslims is the very best thing a muslim can do. To die while killing non-muslims is the best!This book needs to be read by everyone who values freedom and tolerance and the Western tradition. It is richly informing, without resulting to diatribe. The author just sticks to the facts and lays them out in a calm fashion."
4,Fuel for future massacres by Christians? What a joke.,Who's killing who? Please. Your own hatreds are bare to anyone reading your 'review'. Did you even read the book?It's nice to see the Wahhabists are keeping their hands busy when they aren't casing a nuclear plant or oil refinery.
2,Untrustworthy,"I would not rely on this as a sole source for information on Islam. The presentation of Islamic beliefs make them sound rediculous. They may very well be, but I don't trust the author. In a portion of the book, he grossly mistates Catholic theology on indulgences. Either the author is ignorant or disingenuous. I am leaning toward the later. Most anti-catholic literature follows similar tactics. The author proceeds to make a caricature of important religious beliefs and then presents the caricature (which no sane person would endorse) as the actual beliefs of the religion under attack. I don't know enough about Islam to know if the information in this book is accurate, but my stink detector is going off. I would cross check everything in this book with another source.Being on the receiving end of Jack Chick style tactics, I know them when I see them, even when it is another religion that is being defamed."
4,for the contemporary woman,"A unique and eye catching perfume bottle - curved with a marron glace copper lace corset for a luxurious wrap.Top notes are rose made even more mysterious by a tad of rum and orchid. Base notes include mere hints of vanilla, sandalwood and sweet amber.A rare scent best for evening and special occasions."
3,Just okay,My daughter will play with this but not long. She loves to pull the phone up to her face but the cord isn't long enough for her to pick it up without the whole phone coming up with it and she's only 9months old. Also I'm not a big fan of the pull string because she's always getting it wrapped around her leg. All in all I think I'll cut the string off and it can be a toy phone instead of a pull along toy.
2,It seems old and the cord is too short,"A little disappointed. The toy seems old and there is nick on the phone, not like a new buy one at all. The cord for the telephone is so short that my baby has to pick up the entire toy to ""make a call""."
3,"Good classic, one drawback","I purchased this for my 14 month old. He loves phones and pulling toys around. The one big draw back is the length of the phone cord. To hold it to his ear while standing, the phone comes off ground. Overall good classic toy."
2,Looks like an old one,"It looks like an old one. The phone line is a little bit shot. Nothing special about this toy, my son nearly 1 year old, and he seems much more interesting in home phone rather than this one~~~"
3,white square planter,"My planter came today and although it is attractive, it is much smaller than I thought it would be. The top is 14"" wide (or square), but that includes a 1 1/4"" wide lip that doesn't show clearly in the photo, hence inside width is a mere 11 5/8"", instead of 14"" as the dimensions say. Also the inside planting depth is only 11 5/8"" and it's only 12"" high including the legs. I needed a pot for a large fiddle leaf fig and this one is barely bigger than the one the fig is currently planted in. If I had known the exact measurements, I would have ordered and 18"" pot like it. At any rate, after waiting for it to come, I was disappointed it was much smaller than I needed it to be."
5,EL SOL,lo unico que podria escrivir de luis miguel son cosas lindas entonces me voy a limitar a escrivir que el es la pura clase ejemplo si fuera hotel el seria 5 estrellas punto
3,Our Man in Damascus: Elie Cohn,"Our Man in Damascus is the story of Elie Cohn, Israel's, if not the world's, best, most skilled spy ever. After going on several other missions, Elie was sent to spy in Syria and accomplished countless things there. The Syrian president even considered him a close friend! What Elie did was incredible, and, I believe, to this day, has gone unmatched.The book includes a haunting photograph of Elie hanging from the Syrian gallows after being sentenced to death. Elie's story is incredible, but at the same time, extremely touching and depressing, especially when you read about his wife's feelings throughout the whole ordeal.I gave this book only three stars because I believe it is terribly written, and, unfortunately, with better writing, this book could've accomplished much more. However, this book is a must-read if you're interested in Israeli politics, Elie Cohn, or just spying in general!"
1,Nothing to say,This book says very little about Morrie and a quite abit about the auther and his life. I read this book expecting to discover how I might re-prioritize my life. I came away with nothing. I did not get to know Morrie or feel anything towards him. I just kept thinking that the author was taking a tragic situation and trying to make a buck off of it. It might have been better if the author would tell us what impact these final days with Morrie had on his life. Is he now living differently because of this? I wonder.
2,"I hate to say this, but it wasn't that great","Tuesdays with Morrie covers a very important and touching topic. However, the insights handed down from Morrie to Mitch simply aren't that original and failed to enlighten me in the least. It will serve as a REMINDER of what is important in life, but does not break new ground. Morrie was obviously a loving and special man to those around him, but that does not warrant a national craze about this book."
5,"A touching, heart-felt book full of life's lessons.",I found this book to be one I couldn't put down. It is full of unexpected lessons and thought-provoking events.
4,An emotional read,Everyone should have a Morrie Schwartz in his/her life. Such an incredible man with such wisdom. Thank you Mitch for writing this memoir. You were lucky to have known him.
5,life lessons,"the book ""Tuesdays with Morrie"" was absolutely the best book i have ever read. it makes you think about life and death. it makes you look at yourself and ask yourself if your happy with you. there are so many things in life that we have to be thankful for but we take advantage of them. morrie is an old man that is dying. he learns to accept the fact that he is going to die and makes the best out of the time he has. morrie spends his last months teaching an old student, mitch, how to live. he explains that its not the material things that matter but more the people in you life. the simpelest things have the biggest impact. this book is full of wonderful life lesons from how to love, live, and die, to how to forgive."
3,"cute, light, trite","I found this book to be an easy read, and quite predictable. Of course the man's going to die, but I mean predictible sentiment and predictable examination of conscience, etc. It's very accessible for the casual reader (I notice many reviews by high-schoolers here) but not a challenge to understand, nothing deep, nothing we haven't heard before. Yes, we should be kind to others before it's too late. We should love one another. We should get our priorities straight, not work too much, not be afraid to hug. This book is a pleasant reminder of those lessons, but they're lessons we already know. If you like ""Chicken Soup for the Soul"" and other feel-good light spirituality stories, this is probably for you. If you think ""Chicken Soup"" is flavorless, you'll probably think the same of this story."
3,"A moving book, but troublingly exploitative","A very moving work from the Sportswriter. I have a problem with someone profiting off of the tragedy of another though. Come clean, Mitch!"
5,Great book!,"This book became one of my favorites ever. The story is not just about death but about life. As soon as you start reading this ""Tuesdays with Morrie"" you will start comparing Morrie's, Mitch's, and your life. Very inspiring. I recommended this book to many of my friends and they just fell in love. There are also YouTube videos showing real Morrie's interviews and DVD so check them out, too. Enjoy!"
5,Another Inpsiring Example of the Importanct of Connection,"This book touches your soul so deeply about the importance of listening and true human connection. This really supports the fundamentals of our Book,Be the Gift Book - Inspire, Act, Connect."
2,This tedious tale has been told before!,"It must be a guy thing. Two highly-educated gentlement, one an educator, one a clergyman, said I must read this. When I finished I asked, ""Is this all there is?"" Unfortunately, or fortunately, depending on how happy you are to be finished, that is all there is. The philosophy that so fascinates and illuminates the narrator is old, widely acknowledged, and understood by people who have spent any time in introspection. Is it possible that many men have never considered the important aspects of life? Is Morrie that startling to them? Perhaps it is that Morrie states things very simply--which is always good--and is easily understood. Anyway, I would not recommend this to most people--only to those who, like the narrator, are just beginning their quest for truth and beauty."
2,Shoulda Been Tuesday's With Somebody Else,"This book is Exhibit A as to why people love asking barbers,beauticians,bartenders and cab drivers for advice or therapy-rather than ""intellectuals"".My mother of blessed memory was a non-college graduate,who fought cancer for thirteen years-and on her worst day had more worthwhile things to say than Morrie does in this book;I assume the same is true for most""non-professors"" as well.Albom informs us that Morrie was ""bornJewish,but became an agnostic when he was a teenager,partly because of all that happened to him as a child..""This is nonsense-people who have religious faith don't become agnostics because of hard times.And Morrie's use of Auden's quote,""Love each other or perish,""-is sort of like the quote on the statue in 'Animal House':""Knowledge is good.""Hopefully,the sequel to this pompous bore of a book will be about Morrie the cab driver."
2,"OK Writing, Ironic Subject Here","Its odd how this book supposes to be about Morrie's gradual decline and final-year's wisdom but it turns out to be about the authors seemingly bottomless fears about death. The author verges on panic attack as Morrie gracefully flows away; somehow the author seems impervious to Morrie's 'teaching' though many of us readers probably 'get it'. No doubt the author learned a lot about himself too, but in the end he seems to retain his immense dread of death. Its these terribly fearful and panicked friends & relatives who ALWAYS ruin the experience of departing for the rest of us !"
5,This is an inspirational book,"This book has helped me see life differently. In the book morrie says Life is like a rubber band. Which is true I mean if you think about it, life really is like a rubberband it pulls you one way and then it pulls you the other way. Also it got me thinking if today is the day that I would die. I never really did think about it, but now I wonder if I did anything stupid to someone and did not appologize or if my family and friends know that I love them alot and did I do everything that I was supposed to do. This book taches you morals and principles on some of the important aspects that is important to him that would want us to know."
2,Sharing a life,"This is a book about the relationship between a man and his old professor after a diagnosis of Lou Gerick's disease. It outlines how their relationship has changes from that of student/teacher into a deeper one of friend and mentor. The reader is able to see Mitch develop from someone young and impulsive to a diligent and dedicated friend. The culmination of this relationship is witnessed by the reader as they witness how interaction of this relationship is interwoven with other relations the two men have.Throughout the book are short side stories which give the reader cameo shots of events that have influenced both Mitch and Morrie and caused them to choose certain paths in their livesThis book begs the reader to ask the question, ""What is important in a relationship? What is my part in making this relationship meaningful and supportive?"" A look at the relationship of these two men as they prepare for the greatest separation they will face in life.Great read!"
5,A must-read,"I gave it to one of my PhD supervisors because I was sograteful that she was willing to share her time andknowledge. Here was her response:""It's left me with thinking about life and what one makesof it. Aren't authors clever in how they manage to get youto think about things - its a book about a bloke dying butis just excellent on living life honourably and withgentleness.""You were right in the 'one sitting' - compulsive once onehas started! But I now will go back and re-read and getmore of that wisdom."""
3,The Living Take It To Heart,"Watching death is not easy, but especially those involving such as ALS.It is better to go to a house of mourning, than to go to a house of feasting, because that is the end of every man, and the living take it to heart. Ecclesiastes 7:2O death, where is your victory? O death, where is your sting? The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law; but thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. 1 Corinthians 15:55-57See also the fascinating work by Jerome Groopman: ""The Measure of Our Days."""
5,WOW!!!!,I am a junior in an accelerated english class and our teacher reads this to us every day....it is the highlight of our day! i recomend it to anyone who is soul searching! we look forward to it more than anything else and it is teaching us a lot about life!
4,We should all read this by requirement,Seriously! We all have to die someday and can learn something from this book Tuesdays with Morrie. OMG I had so many emotions in this book. It is a true story and a good one. It teaches and teaches and teaches some more. We all need a lesson where we are not biased and are not head strong like when we are argumentative or shallow and this book makes us all sit down and think about our lives and how we should do the best to enjoy it and laugh and be funny while being real to our core. A book for all of the human race.
2,"Vastly overated... Please, I've had enough chicken soup!","I'm amazed at how well received this book has become. I'm a curmudgeon at 29 to be sure, but insightful readers of this book would struggle to find meaning or purpose to the ramblings of a ... Instead of sophisticated answers to life's many philosophical conundrums, we're deluged with aphorisms such as ""When you're in bed, you're dead."" This book is perfect fodder for the Chicken Soup crowd, but woe be to the reader who seeks answers to life's tougher questions."
1,"morons, your bus is leaving","The views expressed in this book are not always stupid, and if you read only one book of pop philosophy this decade you could do worse. But if you care for more than fifteen minutes about any of the issues discussed, and want to think for yourself about the possibility of disagreeing here and there with the conclusions reached on every important topic after ten pages of non-argument, then you might be surprised to know that there exist far better treatments of these same issues which have not been converted into TV specials. Search under ""philosophy"" . . ."
1,It's all about the Benjamins!!,"What a disappointment! All I had heard about this book was how moving and inspirational it was. Then upon reading it I find either of those qualities in it. Rather, is was struck by the selfishness of Albom and his ignorance of what Morrie had been doing. Albom presented Morrie as if Morrie had been needing to be reunited with him to be completely contented. I think that Albom focused too much on their relationship and lessons, and not enough on the big picture. It would be a shame if this book were written as a means for Albom to benefit himself."
5,Great Book,"This is a must read book! I have read it over and over, so that is why I finally bought it. Good quality of a book too!"
5,Everyone should read this book,This was one of the best books that I have read in a long time. This book has stuck with me for weeks. Its a lesson that everyone can relate to. It made me Stop and smell the flowers!
5,Incandescent!,Tuesdays With Morie is a luminous conversation between a man and his mentor. No one can read this book and not return to it time and again. It is an experience in love.
1,Don't waste your time.,"I found this book to be very sappy and condescending. The author portrays his mentor as some sort of saint and prophet. It's the sign of a truly bad work when an author turns a real person into an unreal character. Why did he feel the need to repeat so many of Morrie's ""wise words""? Was it to drill it into the readers' heads, ""Hey, this is important, so pay attention here""? This account was definitely written for the unsophisticated reader. Like another reviewer of this book, I didn't care about either Mitch or Morrie after reading this."
1,Totally Disappointed,"I picked this for a book club based on the many great reviews and fertile topics of discussion the book seemed to bring. Unfortunately, I found the afforisms in the book to be light weight and the sort of thing one might read in a fortune cookie. ""Love each other or perish"";""Forgive yourself before you die. Then forgive others""; ""Dying is only one thing to be sad over. Living unhappily is something else."" I also found the author coming across as opportunistic. He sought out his college professor only after finding out from the Ted Kopple Show that the professor was dying of a disease process in his 80's. The author loses his job AFTER finding the professor and then begins his book writing effort supposedly at the encouragement of the professor. The author emphasizes that the book was the professor's idea several times. Not life changing; not entertaining; but short at least. I found The Last Lecture by Randy Pausch to be a thousand times more inspirational."
5,Great book,One of my favorite books. I've read it several times at different points in my life and each time I take something different away from it.
3,"HOW TO STUDY THIS BOOK, HOW TO KNOW WHAT LIFE IS","This book really is a good food of the soul, reading its, let everyone know how means is life.At that book, Morrie with his student: Mitch, this book author talked about world, feeling sorry for yourself, regrets, death, family, emotions, the fear of aging, money, how love goes on, marriage, culture, forgiveness, the perfect day......It seem including everything of the life.So, how to study this book, how to use this book in the life,I think it is reason what thare are many people like it. Su"
2,Enough already!,"OK, he's a decent writer and this is a heart-warming story, but enough is enough. Let's move on to something a little more interesting. This makes the ""Bridges of Madison County"" look deep."
4,Fast holiday read with a wonderful message,"Mitch Albom is a talented writer and illustrates a wonderful story worth re-sharing. You are left with the desire to approach your golden years with as much grace as Morrie, and to rekindle old mentor-ships."
3,A dying professor's final words,"This is a sad book, but it has an important message about reaching out to people, especially your friends and family. The author mentions several times his reluctance to cry and his teacher's insistence that doing so was acceptable. I'll admit that I cried a few times during this book.The story was adapted into a TV movie starring Jack Lemmon and Hank Azaria. Morrie Schwartz died on November 4, 1995, six-and-a-half weeks before his 79th birthday."
2,HARD TO GET THROUGH,Morrie deserves a lot better. While at times seemingly very heartfelt the author consistently makes it very clear he's not the brightest bulb. Another review put it perfectly. Any book written by Morrie is going to have a whole lot more content-and probably be a hell of a lot less self-satisfied than this author.
3,Ok but seriously folks....,"This is a good book. I like some of Albom's other work like The 5 People you Meet in Heaven... BUT this is not any earthshaking material, certainly not ""life's greatest lesson""... Morrie is no great philosopher and the fact that Ted Koppel put him on Nightline means very little to me sorry. Just a sad story about someone dying who had a positive outlook on life. Not the greatest story every told...."
1,Another Tool of Helping someone but NOT YOU,"Yes, Morrie is knowledgeableNo, he did not have all the answers, afterall, he's just a human (was)Yes, it's a touching storyNo, it's not the first touching story of life - you see the same stoyline more in a Hollywood movie (maybe a deal of adaptation is already underway)Yes, the author probably made millions out of this (thanks to all readers who are prone to hype)No, I don't think he's really into Morrie's teaching, afterall, you don't see him make tribute to his most beloved mentor through a charity fund named after Morrie with all the money earned, or really carry out the learning. Instead he made a bookdeal by leveraging his relationship with a overnight sensation of the TV, and as a self-centered opportunist, shallowly recorded the teaching as his blueprint roadmap to his fatten piggy bank."
2,Tuesdays with Morrie is extremely overrated,"Mitch Albom's Tuesdays with Morrie is far from a great work of writing. It is generally trite and overtly sappy/sentimental. Morrie Schwartz was undoubtedly a nice man, and possibly intelligent -- but please, the book is boring."
1,Low-Cal Philosophy for the Masses,"Handling the ultimate questions at the level of a third grade, Mitch Albom does an effective job of stripping this painful episode of any meaning by attempting to boil it down to Chicken Soup for the Soul."
5,What a wonderful uplifting story,Book was in amazing shape and the story was better than I could have expected. Just one of the reasons I continue to shop with Amazon.
5,Lessons in life,"An old man a young man speak of lives lessons,the could haves should haves and would haves if we all had a second chance.a must read for all ages.it will give you hope and inspiration.Read it today"
5,Moving Tribute To A Mentor,"This book movingly recounts the author's rekindling of a relationship with his former professor who is dying of a terminal illness. Concisely written, it has the emotional intensity of a diary. Tuesdays With Morrie is a window into the mind of a hard-bitten sportswriter whose life priorities are dramatically altered by a teacher facing death with dignity, courage, and a zest for life. Reading this book may change your life, too."
1,Missing one CD,"I bought the CD to play it in class while we read the book. However, CD # 1 is missing!! I was not ableto do my lesson as planned."
5,Read this book. Could change your life.,"Learn how to live through the lessons presented by a dying man. Don't let fear block your emotions. I was skeptical about learning anything I had not already figured out in life. Step back, go with it, experience and enhance your life and the lives of everyone you meet just by being as human as you can be. Imagine all the people living for today."
4,A Book About Life,"This book is a wonderful portration of life. I enjoyed seeing into the lives of someone else, seeing their trials and separating myself from my own life. This book can help anyone to see how valuable life is and how we should live it. You don't have to agree with all the principles they lived by to understand where they're coming from and learn from their experiences. Another thing I liked about this story was that it was blunt, they did not clean it up and make it pretty for the readers they told it like it was and that makes for a great, true life story."
5,a deeply human and profoundly insightful book,"an almost lyrical testament to what it is to be human--filled with pathos and,yes,joy."
5,An inspirational celebration of a life well lived.,"I was greatly moved by this book. Morrie is truly a great man who recognized that he was not the physical body most of us perceive ourselves to be. In my opinion, Mr. Albom provided an enormous service in making Morrie's lessons available to all of us.I only wish someone like Mr. Albom would have been around in the final years of one of my primary teachers Buckminster Fuller. Like Morrie, Bucky has an enormous perspective which I feel is essential to our success and survival as individuals and as a species. The shift from competition to cooperation from hate to love from struggle to acceptance from a ""you or me"" to a ""you and me"" society that these ""wise elders"" advocate is needed now more than ever.Books like Tuesdays With Morrie help us realize that we are not alone and our lives do make a difference. They are a tribute to the great humans who walk among us."
5,A Fullfilled Life,"Tuesdays with MOrrie was a great book. I really enjoyed reading it. If I could recommend this book it would be to my grandmother, because I feel that it could have a great impact on her life. Morrie was a man who had a good head on his shoulder. He looked at life and death as a good thing. He never gave up on anything. He was a man who was caring, loveing, and thoughful. He wanted to teach until the day he died, his funeral being the final. He made the worst parts of life, turn to be the greatest parts of life. Everyone should take in consideration, Morries life and how he went upon things. I defently recommend this book to everyone, its a great book and it will make you look at life differently."
4,An overview of Tuesdays with Morrie,It was a good book about life lessons Morrie learned and the acceptance of his death
3,Drawn-out Proverb,"The message is sweet and simple: be warm and affectionate to others and you will find peace in your own life. And with that aside, I feel this book is a drawn-out proverb that was in luck to get three stars from me."
1,No day of the week (preferably),"While this appears to be a great, inspirational book, it's not. The relationship between Mitch and Morrie is slightly interesting, I suppose. The whole book, though, is just one big sympathy request. Apparently Morrie was summoning the spirit of ""Bartlett's Familiar Quotations."" All of Morrie's lines could theoretically be a quote you add to your picture in the yearbook. And that's the problem. It's quote overkill. The average person doesn't speak in constant inspirational quote mode. This book didn't change my life, but it did change the position of my eyes (that is, off the pages of this book). This book is also a desperate attempt to engage sympathy for Morrie. I'm sorry he has ALS, but I can't do anything to change that (especially since he's now dead)."
1,HORRIBLY DISAPPOINTING!,"I was so hyped over the reviews I read and the show on Oprah last November that I ordered 2 copies of the book right away. One for my husband and myself and one for a friend for christmas. My friend was gracious about it I guess because it was a gift but they read on and kept waiting for something to happen.....I on the other hand have never been able to finish the book....it didn't hold my attention at all. I can't believe that some people actually referred to it as 'the best book you'll ever read'...NO WAY! I was and am still terribly disappointed in the book. What a waste of my time and money. I would be ashamed to recommend this book! There isn't a 'NO STAR' rating , so I feel unduly pressured to offer a greatly undeserved 'ONE STAR' rating."
2,A disappointing book about an amazing man.,"Tuesdays With Morrie disappointed me for several reasons. Although Morrie Schwartz obviously has many lessons for the world, I quickly tired of hearing them in ""fortune cookie"" form. Albom's utter idolization of Morrie is annoying. In fact, by the time I finished reading TWM a second time I was livid with Mitch Albom marginalizing Morrie into an old man who randomly belts out a proverb.I was interested at first, but after a few chapters the lessons blur and Albom's arrogance becomes intolerable. Albom moans and whines about how much he sacrifices to visit his old professor. All I can see is how hopelessly self-centered Mitch really is. Mitch mentions how he continued to bring food to Morrie for months after Morrie stopped eating normal food. How oblivious and rude can one be?There are important lessons taught by Morrie Schwarz, lessons everyone should take to heart and teach to others. Unfortunately it appears that Mitch Albom is a very poor student."
1,Albom's book is shallow.,I agree with the NYTimes book review which slams Albom's book and the shallowness of his discussions. Albom background and past history does not fit with his recollections and is close to being selfserving at a time when he set aside many of those discussions and walked over the back of his fellow workers at the Detroit Free Press.
1,Yeesh.,"The success of this book and the many gushing, syrupy reviews here just go to show how far the dumbing-down of North American society has gotten, more's the pity. Emotion is the highest good, and the reviewers who say that this book is a cut above most things out there are unwittingly revealing how gullible, mushy and anti-intellectual they really are--do they ever read anything challenging, or just pap like this? Does the book say something valuable? Is it written with talent and verve? Can we discuss it on an intellectual level? Nah, let's concentrate on all the gooey emotions it conjures up. Shame on all of you."
5,What is Death???,"In a culture where death is handled in a very 'sanitary' and off-hands way, Morrie talks candidly what it means to die, and how one creates value thru this process!!! We are living in the times of chain-store-funeral-homes! Death is dealt with sorrow and something unnatural.""If you need to learn more about life, learn about death"" - This sentiment is embodied in this book.The cherry on the cone is the format of Mentor-desciple relationship between Morrie and his student (from past); its beautiful to see how both are enriched through this experience.A must read for anyone who want to learn how to live!"
1,Take a tip from Morrie,"Take a tip from Morrie and go live your life rather than waste it on this horribly written book. To sum up the book...""I'm dying...this is what its like to die..dying...the end"". There is no substance to this book and nothing to learn. Nothing is learned from the dialogue and it makes me wonder if the author even learned anything from these Tuesdays sessions with Morrie. I grew tired very quickly of reading about Morrie talking about not talking about death. Save your time and your money by not reading this, and you will be living a better life."
5,Touched by Morries Words,"I have heard many wonderful things about this book over the last couple of years, but I didn't believe them until I read it for myself. This story provided me with insight on my own life as well as Morries. His words were so full of passion and intelligence that there was never a dull moment in this story. It makes you question life and the quality to which you are living your own life. It makes you want to be a better person and to do the things that we sometimes forget to do in this busy world. I enjoyed reading this book and feel that it helped me to realize how many things I have to be thankful for. I suggest that everyone read this book, it has something in it for everyone."
5,Plain and simple - Magnificent,"I got this album for X-mas, and popped it into my CD player, the hypnotic sound simply grabbed me by the throat, and would not release me. The sound of this album made me immagine I was sitting on a grassy cliff of Iceland, surveying the coast. These may not exist but in my immagination, but it was a great feeling."
1,Must be heard to be believed,This music is aptly named Space-rock. It's spacey; appealing toa peculiar taste in music.
1,Like whales with gas,"The guy I work with plays this constantly. It sounds like whale song. Worse, whales with gas.Next time he steps away from his computer, I'm going to delete these songs from his hard drive. I think I know where he keeps the CD..."
5,I feel like an idiot,"After listening to this album, i nearly cried, because i was so touched. Once its over you can see things so differently in the world. This is one of my favourite albums ever!!!!! I wouldnt call this music though, it a celebration of tuned sound. Anyone with an open mind in music needs this album and all of sigur ros other works. Its all brilliant and im not joking, this will stay with you forever."
3,"nice, but...","Sure, it's ""haunting"" and outside the norm, but I've quickly grown tired of it. I'd recommend buying it used, but it's not a landmark release by any means."
5,"Angelic, full, well-produced.","Probably the most emotion filled and aesthetically pleasing album of the last decade. Personally I feel its the best album made in recent years, definately the best album thats more instrumental than lyrical(I say this, because the lyrics although clever and good are somewhat minimalistic along with Jonsi's voice usually being used as more of an instrument than a way to convey words.) I would recommend this to pretty much anyone. Put it on loud, lay down....possibly alter your state of consciousness and enjoy."
4,I Get It and I LOVE IT,"This is the soul of new music. Forget the last review by ""music connoissieur"" (hopefully you can buy his copy on Amazon). 200 CDs - BFD - I've got literally 5000 CDs and this one rises to the top of the stack. Start here before proceeding to Mogwai or Godspeed You Black Emperor (I've got everything by both of them and Sigur Ros leads the pack). There is much more interesting instrumentation and production happening here. I especially enjoy the vocals - (unless the artist is Bob Dylan or Dylan Thomas, I just as soon hear a native language or false language that doesn't subtract from the emotional impact of the music).When I head to the ocean to catch the sun and walk in the waves I grab 2 CDs to let my mind float freely away - this one and MBV's Loveless - Try 'Em Both!. It hits that Robert Wyatt chakra where it is a bit abstract but still warm and emotional. In years to come you will melt your Coldplay CDs but you will preserve this one."
2,Solo Anthology,"I bought this CD for my husband for Christmas. When we were young we listened to Smokey. We were disappointed in the songs that were on these CD's. There were more songs we didn't recognize than we did. It was a bit disappointing, but we did enjoy the songs we knew."
5,Great flour for low carb baking,"I have been using Bob's Red Mill All-Natural Nut Flours for several years to bake low-carb breads and baked goods. I also use the Hazelnut flour to bread chicken, in lieu of flour. The product is always great tasting and easy to work with."
1,order missing item - no way to contact anyone about this,"I ordered 2 boxes of 4 bags each of ground hazelnuts, or 8 bags total. I received only 7 bags - one of the boxes had been opened prior to shipment and resealed with regular packaging tape. There is no way to contact the seller via the Amazon web-site in order to advise them of this, and they do not disclose the shipper. How am I expected to deal with this situation?"
2,scratched,Movie did not run properly. I did not try returning so I don't know if they would take it back.
4,The Last Creative Suicide Machines Album,"Let me just start out by saying that I've been a huge Suicide Machines fan since Destruction first came out in '96 I think it was. On their fourth release here, it is starting to become obvious that they are losing their creative edge; not completely though. There are 4 or 5 really good songs on the cd but the rest are mainly mediocre.Once A Match and Some Gasoline came out it became obvious that they were trying to please the fans by reverting to their old ska/punk roots but they failed miserably. None of those songs could hold a candle to even the worst song on Destruction; and War Profiteering was just an embarrasement. They sounded like they were trying to be hardcore to relate to the younger crowd which by now, are the only fans they have left. Anyway, I'm not writing this to rag on them; it's just disappointing that this is their last album that I can enjoy at all."
4,Excelente trabajo en directo,"Con este álbum ""desenchufado"" la banda chilena liderizada por el carismático Beto Cuevas regresa después del muy exitoso álbum 'Uno'.Al escuchar el álbum por primera vez lo encontré excelentemente producido. Destacan por encima de la mayoría de los temas las inéditas ""Mentira"", ""Intenta Amar"" y ""Luna"" con una musicalización y letras exquisitas; ""The Corridor"" donde Beto canta en inglés; el hermoso tema ""El Duelo"" interpretado a duo con Ely Guerra; y los temas ""Aquí"", ""Fuera de mí"" y ""Al Final"", del álbum 'Uno'.Este definitivamente es un excelente álbum para los no iniciados en la música de La Ley, así como los fanáticos del trabajo de esta banda."
2,Only if you're a fan of Mexican Pop,"I love the Mana unplugged CD and DVD and think it transcends language and most musical taste. Not the case with this one. All the folks who say ""If you love MTV Unplugged, you'll love this"" are off-base. Mana is like the Mexican Eagles - something for everyone with amazing instrumentals and vocals. Yeah these guys can play and sing, but too mushy for my taste- think Enrique Iglesias. Plugged in, these guys probably make great Latin Pop for all the (...) girls out there."
1,No trails,"The topo maps are fine on this product, but for hiking I wouldn't bother - there are no trails. I searched around Jasper National Park and Cape Breton in Nova Scotia, and couldn't find *any* trails in this map set at any level of zoom or detail. If you're used to the US Topo maps by Garmin, you'll be disappointed. The disks I received from Amazon said ""Version 2.0"", which were ordered in August, 2007."
4,Garmin MapSourceTopo Canada,"I received the topo map just before leaving for Algonquin Park. Loaded into my Garmin 60CSx with no problems (have a 2 gig card installed). I was able to plan out the entire trip and mark the beginning and end of each portage. It was amazing to be paddling down a 15 mile lake and look down at the canoe floor to see an arial view of where we were in the lake, our speed, time to the next portage and a red arrow pointing the direction to paddle. The topo maps covered the park very well, but detail not there once you leave the park areas and travel on the roads... but enough information to allow us to navigate our way back without any problems. I used a carabiner clip to attach the unit to the thwart of the canoe and that worked well."
5,2 thumbs up for this cd,This CD is absolutely mesmerizing! It is my favorite souvenir from vacationing in the islands...
3,Cute.......,"I was so excited to get my retro Reeboks! They look great, but the tongue kinda curls under making them a bit uncomfortable. Maybe once they break in better?? But, they are giving me the ankle support I need after a bad sprain. I don't think the quality is as good as the 80's version."
1,Excellent research sorely in need of editing,"This lengthy book is almost unreadable. Topics are treated in seemingly random order, sentences are tortured, and where meaningful chapter titles could have helped the reader navigate the 900+ pages, Thomas chose odd quotes as chapter titles which actually detracted from the reading experience. I made it through the book only because the information was so riveting. If only greater care has gone into editing it!"
2,Get Culture Shock: Japan intstead.,"Thsi book was disappointing. I've read others in the Xenophobes series, and they were informative and humorous, though not particularly practical as travel guides. However, the Japan guide was neither. Having already read Culture Shock: Japan, I was very disappointed in this book. It has less information -- and less humor -- than Culture Shock. In fact, the Xenophobes guide had exactly 2 facts not mentioned in Culture Shock. Whether you are interested in travelling to Japan, or just looking for multicultural humor, I do not recommend this particular Xenophobes Guide."
4,Baby Shower Gift,I purchased this a gift for a baby shower. So far I haven't heard any complaints from baby or Mommy.
3,Good Clock - Bad Outdoor Sensor,"The clock itself is good. It projects the time & temperature clearly and sharply onto the ceiling. It's very nice that during the night, you wake up and know the time and outside temperature. I leave the ""projector"" red light on all-day and it's been more than 1 year, the light is still on. I bought 2 of this: one for my parents and one for myself. Both outdoor sensors went bad after the first set of batteries died (about 3-5 months). At first I thought it was the sensors that failed to ""communicate"" with the clock after I changed the batteries. I followed exactly what the manual says to ""sync"" up, but I just wasted my time. I had to buy 2 new replacement sensors. So don't expect much because they are Made in Ch---. The buttons at the front of the clock are so small so it's a bit difficult not to press the wrong ones in the dark. After all that, I still like this clock."
4,Great Projection Clock,"I use this clock everyday. It not only shows the time also tells you outside temperature. I project the clock on the ceiling. When I feel lazy to wakeup in the morning, I will look it up on the ceiling to decide if I can sleep little more instead of using annoying alarm clock to wake me up. The projection light is not annoying bright and the light is enough to see the time and temperature. Overall I like this product."
2,disapointed,"I found that this recording was to me disapointing. I have been a fan of Phil Coulter's for a very long time and have liked everything that I had heard him do, until this. I was so hopeing to once again hear the sweeping monumental type of music that I find so great, but instead I found a sort of etheral whimsyness that quite frankly I dislike."
5,Lake of Shadows,"To me, ""Lake of Shadows"" by Phil Coulter, is his best cd. The haunting songs & melodies stay in your mind. His way with words bring you to tears on certain songs. The melodies linger on. You will NOT be disappointed with this cd. Just lovely."
5,Wonderfully Done!,"This is one of the most well done and accurate books you'll find on Hoodoo/Rootwork, since most Hoodoo practices are passed orally or by example, it's difficult to find a book on the practices in the first place. It was great to see our New Years practices/meal in there too..You know what I'm talking about if you live in the South- Ham, Salat(Greens) or Cabbage, Black-Eyed Peas and Cornbread every New Years Day for Good Luck and money. It's surprising that the author lives in California, from the book you would think she had lived in the South since birth, she did live in the Ozarks for many years I believe..Excellent and Practical Book. Folk practices for Poke Root and Sumac are even listed in the book! Cole of the Crooked Cane Website"
5,Stands the test of time,I first read this book 20 years ago. I could pick it up today and still be entertained reading it. There are not many books that stand the test of time like that.Katherine Kurtz is a master. Everything she writes is brillant.
5,This book will draw you in and not let you back out !,"The Bishop's Heir is Kurtz's best work to date. The characters are realistic, the story is spellbinding. You'll pick it up and never want to put it down. If you like fantasy books this is a must!"
4,Uncommonly good,"By far and beyond the best history periodical I have come across. And consistantly one of the best magazines I have read. I have subscribed for three years now-and that says a lot for me, especially given the price, since most magazines don't keep my interest for longer than a year. I find myself dropping anything I am currently reading, magazines and books alike, until I have finished each one.Easy to read and yet usually contains much detail that you can sink your teeth into. The articles do a fantastic job of appealing to both the uninformed and the seasoned student of history. Ever have one of those teachers that would tell a story and then, at the end, after being rivited by the narrative, you actually found you had learned something in a way that made you feel almost as if you had experienced it yourself? Well, many times I find that this magazine does just that. Every now and then they do get a little fluffy but all in all, unbeatable."
3,One of the Best,"Of all the trim books I have bought, and there have been a few, this particular book had the best information. It covers topics not found in other books and is more than just the basics. All in all, it's one of the best trim books I have bought."
5,BIG BIG BASS,"I ordered this sub because my my original was damaged in a flood, I was upset about the flood damage and didnt realize when I ordered that this was a 12 inch speaker instead of the 10 inch I had. The 10 inch compared to this is a toy! I'm so glad I ordered this, although when I first received it, it gave me pause, because its so big. But the sound is so amazing I dont care. Movies always sounded okay with the old sub, but I hated the way music sounded. Now the music is full and dynamic, and you dont notice the separation between the low and high frequencies anymore, solid sound, punchy and deep."
5,love my book very good guide lines,"i enjoyed my book very good guide lines, my son's Dr referred me to get the book to read it.still reading the book, so far good information on raising a very energic son. i just started reading it abouta month and so far it's has great topics it gives you not done with it yet."
4,Sent this as a gift,"I sent this book to a relative who was having trouble understanding her grandson. I had the book from my teaching days. I found the book very helpful in seeing ""difficult"" children in a new way. She has found it helpful to think of her grandson from this perspective and to gain a better grasp of what makes him the way he is, without resorting to labels such as ADD or Autistic."
2,not what i was looking for,I bought this to help me with my very active 18 month old. This book was for older children. Might be mote helpful for older kiddos.
1,Too generalized,Theory could apply to almost anyone. It seems you anticipate a child's reactions and moods and plan to change their environment or cater to them. How many people in the child's life will be able to do that? Wouldn't their expectations increase?
5,Womenfolks,"I love this book. If you are a woman and you grew up in the south during the 40s and 50s, you will probably like it, too. I've bought many copies and have wound up giving them away to friends. I need to buy another couple of copies.If you are a man and grew up in the south during the same time period, you will probably like this book, too."
1,It's six hours of agony,This miniseries is awful. It starts off as a murder mystery and ends as one but the filler in the middle is terrible. It just drags on. People who like the HBO series The Newsroom might like it but I watched the hour with a Newsroom buff who couldn't stand the Hour.
4,"A great collection, but with so-so disc quality.","This disc should have been remastered in DTS or 5.1, but hey, it's Erasure, and they're amazing. Lots of effort went into this compilation (the tracks, not the quality of the disc itself), and it's well worth having if you're a big fan."
5,unusual design,I got this ring as a gift. I love it because of its unusual and beautiful design. My only comment for those who are considering buying it is that the image makes it look bigger. It's not as big or thick as it looks in the picture. Very beautiful though.
1,small and no magnifing,"The binoculars I received are so small the distance between the two lenses is less than the distance between an average persons pupils. You can only look thru one lens at a time. With the zoom slide set on 5, I get 1:1 vision, no magnifing at all. Pushed the slid all the way to 15 and the image became smaller than at 5X. In process of returning them now. Will go to a bricks and mortar store to buy a set so I can try them out first. I love Amazon but they should discontinue this item."
4,A Really Good Purchase,"If what your looking for is a compact quality binocular, this is a great choice: The engineering is tight and the lens are very good. It is light and easy to focus. I thought the price ($20) was a sign to stay away, not so, I am completely satisfied."
3,Small but nice zoom,These are very compact and have a nice zoom. The small size limits the light gathering ability.Optics are fairly clear for the price range.
4,book,"For a first time making compost, I thought this book was very good to read. Information was very easy to understand and kept a good pace to learn. Definitely recommend to anyone that wants to learn about composting."
2,Eh...,"This book did not do it for me. I was hoping to get lots of good information, both scientific and practical. I was hoping that this book will contain enough information for an urban dweller, who wants to start a compost in his balcony. Unfortunately, I found the book shallow and skimpy on material.It felt, more like an article online than a complete book. It contains very little on indoor composting, or balcony composting. For example, I was hoping that I will be able to read ways to minimize any odors, and be able to create my own composting solution out of a bucket, plastic container, a drill etc. Unfortunately, not so.After reading through the book, I feel I know very little that I didn't know already. This book just didn't add much to my knowledge. It could have included pictures, information about scientific processes happening behind the curtains, ideas for working with various limitations, and reasons for categorizing stuff as 'brown' or 'green'."
4,Great book,The second book was even better than the first. This is such a good series. One of my favorite books.
4,Great family fun,"The liken series is fun, entertaining, and mostly accurate. It does depict the stories with slight artistic license, but overall I found it to be highly accurate. The music is fun and very catchy, and it really helps the kids learn to love the scripture stories. Some may feel that it takes the scriptures too lightly by making some fun with them, but I found it to be tasteful and appropriate."
1,Terrible Sound,"I have tried this DVD in 3 different DVD players and with two different sound systems, and the sound is just awful. Why are the drums so loud, I can hardly hear the rest of the band? And why do the drums only come out of the right speaker, infuriating. The worst music DVD I have ever bought. I am not anti cult as I also have Music Without Fear which is brilliant. The shot editing is terrible as well, you barely get 1-2 secs of the same shot."
2,Apparently needs some work....,I bought one of these batteries brand new however I could not seem to make it work with my iPod. My solution for this dilemma was to simply return it for my money back and to order this brand new 100 hour iPod battery called the GeekPod 100 from batterygeek.net. I learned about it from a positive review of it Macworld magazine and it has been giving my iPod tons of run time. So far so good...
4,Very basic,"This book provides very basic Baptist beliefs. Would be especially good for those new to the faith and for review. Easy read, short and to the point."
2,No Examples?!?!,"The book is great a explaining the items, but there are no examples to practice what you learn. I have always liked for dummies books, but this one lost my respect."
1,Whiney Gibberish,"The most incoherent, slapped together, piece of garbage ever to be called a book. This guy sholdn't be allowed to write anything anymore, including his name."
1,I'd give it less if I could,"What a shame. Wasted money on horrible storytelling. Glad amazon has a return policy, this is one time I sadly had to use it."
4,Just what I was looking for,I recieved this in a couple of days and it worked great. i am now able to use my old bluetooth headset and not have to purchase new one. Can't beat it for the price.
1,Product dimensions inaccurate,"This product is described as being 18"" in length, when in fact it is only 15"". It was wide enough, but not long enough for my lateral filing cabinet."
2,Miniature version of GO,"This is a good product, only thing is that it's a miniature version of the real game. For a few more dollars I got a full size board and stones."
4,Fun but short,"This game was really fun as it reminded me a lot of the other games i have like syberia 1 &2 and the longest journey. the story was fun but i thought it was too shrt and the ending was a little anticlimactic. I do like how they ended it, it makes you want to play a sequal, but just the abruptness of the ending was what was disapointing. still i really liked the game."
5,Awesome,"This one is awesome. I recommend it.It makes more sense to have played Post Mortem before this, but I doubt that it would make a difference if you haven't. Besides, Post Mortem is not the most fun I thought (but it's not too bad).Still Life was REALLY good & I can't wait for the sequel."
2,"""just another adventure game""","I concur with Derek. There's really nothing standout about this game. You've seen almost all of the puzzles before, some of which are particularly irrelevant to the plot. The voice acting is pretty good and the dialogue is just so-so...and both are downright poor with respect to the parts of the game that take place in 1920's Prague. (Neither the characters' vocabulary or dialect suggest they're from anywhere but present-day America.) And the story of hunting down a serial killer has been done to death. But the graphics are beautiful, especially the in-game paintings (which are central to the game), and the decked-out killer himself.If you want an innovative adventure game that broadens your horizons, check out The Indigo Prophecy (aka Fahrenheit)--which actually is another serial killer story, but much more interesting in every way--or, even better, get Grim Fandango."
3,Pretty Good,"Other reviewers have pretty well covered all I would have to say, except one point, which appears in this game and in many games today. All the main protagonists are female. I have no real hassle with this, but do only females become FBI agents? I guess I do have one other complaint, but it is from a male's point of view. So many of the protagonists are downright (don't be offended ladies, I'm not talking about you here) ugly. In one game the leading lady is crosseyed. This is distracting to say the least. There are a few games that have male leads - mainly the ones taken from a tv show, i.e. CSI:NY. My rant doesn't take away from whether or not the game is playable. This one is, but I would rather the game makers quit trying to be politically correct."
3,Get Bruce's CW and AOB first.,If you don't have Chemical Wedding and Accident of Birth get both of those instead of this cd. They are as good or better than anything IM has ever put out - which is saying a lot.This cd isn't worth the price if you have CW and AOB.
4,Almost perfect!,"I'll keep it short and sweet - this is essential music for ANY metal fan. Sadly, the cover version of ""All the young dudes"" SHOULD HAVE BEEN ON HERE. Regardless, buy this album, turn it up, get a few beers, and realize you just took your life to the next level."
5,My 6 week old daughter loves it!!,I've attached the Slumbertime Soother to the side of my daughter's pack-n-play. Whenever I need a little time I place her in there and she LOVES watching the lights and listening to the music. When she's ready for a nap the nature sounds are very soothing...for both of us!
5,Slumbertime soother is great!!!,This above anything else is my son's favorite toy. He is almost 2 years old and he loves it more and more each day. At bedtime he reaches up and presses the large button and his music starts. We even take it on vacation with us. We love this so much that we purchased one for my sister for her new baby. It doesn't eat batteries either.
5,Sarah's sleepy time soother!,"We love this! Sarah is one and has had this from the start to fall asleep to. IT WORKS! Nice songs, volume control and a wonderful remote to switch it back on (secretly from the doorway) if they need alittle more time to get to sleep. LOVE IT!UPDATE : SARAH IS OVER TWO NOW and still enjoys falling to sleep to her music box. She now turns it on and off her self, if she wakes up from a dream or just feels like sleeping in she will press the button and turn it on to go back to sleep."
1,Broke into pieces in less than a week.,Buyer beware! I picked this up at Target and it fell apart after less than a week. The metal twisted out of shape and broke off. I'm shopping for another model on amazon and hope to have better luck this time - since it's actually a great concept.
2,Disapionted,"Even though this camcorder has many great functions, I was disappointed that I had a dirty head warning after the first 60 minutes of use. Not what I expect after spending 650+. The recorder was new (sealed box). Trying to get the recording on a VCR is also giving me problems. It may be my TV and VCR are Multi-system units but I don't think that's the problem. I am fair with the cable connections and expected immediate success. Things should not be so tough. I have been able to watch the movies connecting directly to the TV though and like the quality of the picture. I'm sure I will get it going and hope head cleaning is not required every 60 minutes of use."
4,allison krauss 100 miles or more,"Nice compilation of Allison's solo work, collaboration with other talented artists, and commentaries. The DVD is of excellent quality; it seems almost like high definition. Any Allison Krauss fan will appreciate this DVD."
2,A Hundred Miles or More dvd Alison Krause,Interesting show. Nice interviews. Love Alison but the songs are too slow and boring.
4,great game play game,"what i loved most about this game is how much simple and fun it is. if you are tired of all the heavy thinking games and need a break, pick this up its worth it."
5,Snoopy was a success!,"This game was purchased for my 9 year old son for his birthday. He really likes it, as does his 11 year old brother, too. Good bargain!"
4,Very good game for peanuts fans,"A very good game for fans of the peanuts gang. Gameplay is suited for children, as well as adults. Controls to the game were simple and the missions were entertaining. Somewhat of a surprise. Was not expecting this type of gameplay, but very happy with the product."
5,Absolutely Great Glow in the Dark Tape,"This is the real deal! So many of the cheaper or more common glow in the dark tapes just don't ""hold"" the light all that long and are certainly much less bright. When they say ""Ultra Premium"" they aren't kidding. I have used this tape in a number of applications and have been totally pleased with it's performance."
4,fun,This version is more current so a bit more enjoyable. Although it it sometimes difficult to identify the images in the picture cards.
1,JUST DONT BUY IT,as title saysyou will sure regret if you dont read this before you buy the item.read read read
3,"Mini USB, Not Micro USB","Buyers, please know there's difference between mini USB and micro USB. Mini is larger than micro and most mobile phones that have USB ports only have micro USB. I bought this for my HTC Evo phone, but it's too big. I had to get the micro USB charger instead. Just a heads-up!"
3,getting all bendy,It's shiny and light. But it bends. I ride a bmx bike with no shocks and I weigh 140 lbs+20 lbs backpack. The seatpost angle is about 15-20 degrees from vertical and I had it installed with only three inches in the frame. It starting bending slightly at the part closest to the frame. It was probably all those bumps and curbs. It didn't seem to be bending any further though.
5,"What I expected, and more!","I absolutely love this book! It helped me in a rough spot when I was going through a completely dry design faze! The entire ""Idea Index"" series is a personal favorite. I'm at entry-level in my design career, so maybe this book isn't that great for the more experienced artist, but I have found it very useful for my current work. Thanks."
5,a beautiful design work itself,"I Love this book, abundant information, clear structure and absolutely beautiful designed."
1,Too small to know,"This book may be fantastic, but I have no idea as the width of the book is too small to properly open the book. Why would a designer approve this book size, makes me question how good he can be. I wished I had saved my money as it is too frustrating to battle out holding the book open to read."
5,"Nice shoes, good price","I bought 2 pairs of these shoes(one brown,one black). They are comforatable, good fit, and look great. All that at a great price ($55)."
5,#2 PRIDE event ever,"Many sites have called this card the best PRIDE event ever and the Gomi/Diaz fight the best fight ever. While I give the first title to PRIDE 14 and the second title to Diego Sanchez/Joe Stevenson at UFC 95, you will not be dissappointed by the quality of this event. Several quick knockouts and a few extremely tight submissions on this DVD; only one fight goes to a decision. The full card is:Joachim Hansen/Jason IrelandKazuo Misaki/Frank TriggTravis Wiuff/James LeeAntonio Rogerio Nogueira/Rameau Thierry SokoudjouHayato Sakurai/Mac DanzigSergey Kharitonov/Mike RussowMauricio Rua/Alistair OvereemTakanori Gomi/Nick DiazMIDDLEWEIGHT (205) CHAMPIONSHIP: Wanderlei Silva/Dan HendersonThere is something for everyone on this card, and it is well worth the purchase. For those who complain about the lack of fighter entrances, they are on the DVD, just in the special features."
1,get over yourselves,...john mayer fanatics. this album blows. I tried to listen and his breathy woman vocals made me want to puke.
1,I Ain't Impressed A'TALL,"OK, John Mayer, whoop-whoop; I saw him on ""Austin City Limits"" awhile back, and I (AND my Wife, too!) thought it was Nelson Mandela's step-son, Dave Matthews. And now, he's gone and 86'd Jessica (""What...ME worry?"") Simpson, too. ""Fifteen Munutes of Fame,"" Johnny...OK, all THAT aside: I don't know who Mayer is (ahem) ""cozy"" with, because, like Johnny Lang and the aforementioned Matthews, he HAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO SAY. And, again: all THAT aside, how did this @#$% manage to get the Who's bass player and Keef's drummer to provide the thythm section for this mess? Save your money,or go buy Tony Joe White's newest CD."
5,Quit the hatin',"Here's what you all should do. First off, run out and buy this album. And right before you put the cd in ur cd player take all comparisons out of your head... And take it for what it is. It's john mayer's attempt at the blues. He's playing what he likes, which means his heart and soul is into it. If you can't see that and appreciate it, you're right for not liking it. Blues isn't about playing sick guitar phrases and riffs, it's about putting every ounce of your heart into the music, your personality and your soul. That's exactly what john did. and he did it well. John is an incredible artist, with tremendous talent. Any john mayer fan will see that and love this cd. it probably won't appeal to the casual fan, but then again...that's not really who it's for."
3,"pretty good,but John Mayer ain't quite there yet","dug the Blue Note records looking cover. John Mayer is a talented Guitar Player who works quite well with Pino Palladino&Steve Jordan. the only thing missing here is that while Polished&well played,John Mayer ain't ready to get where he is attempting to get to.He seems like He is trying to hard to Impress or be beyond where he has at now.nothing wrong with taken a Artistic risk,but while John Mayer is well suited for the James Taylor vibe he ain't quite fully ready to tackle the stevie Ray Vaughan side of town. but nevertheless I enjoy the musicianship&this is a Pretty good album adding all things up.I'd give this album a 2&half to a 3 to round things up."
4,what a pleasant surprise,"I knew next to nothing about John Mayer until I caught a PBS special one night and was blown away with his guitar playing. It was reminiscent of the great rock guitarist and certainly refreshing of a relatively new talent. So I went out and read reviews of all his CD's and decided on ""Now"".I was not disappointed. His guitar playing at times reminds me of Stevie Ray Vaughan. And his bass player and drummer are certainly top-notch. I highly recommend this CD for any serious music lover."
3,"Pretty Darn Good music, lousy sound.","Well, I liked the album in it's entirety. Forget about the folks who whine that this isn't SRV, so what? It's John Mayer, Steve Jordan and Pino Palladino laying down some nice jams. Ok, the music might come off a tiny bit sterile cause it's not SRV or JIMI, but not enough to make any sort of difference.My one gripe and it's a big one, is the sound quality of this album. I consider it sonically poor, hence the missing stars. I know live albums are difficult to master well, but it's done all the time and the Producer really fell flat on his face here. It's really a shame that this recording sounds so amatureish as the music is so good."
4,A Real CD for Real Music Fans...,"This is a great CD. It really showcases John Mayers amazing talent, in my opinion he is one of the best guitar players ever. And yes, dispite what the other ""hater"" reviewers said, John can really sing. Warning to some, this is a Blues cd, this is a completley different type of cd than ""Room for sqaures"". This may turn off some fans, but dont worry, John's new solo CD ""Continuium"" is due out in Spring 06."
2,Didn't like it,"I love John Mayers' music. I think he is an incredible guitar player. So I was curious about the John Mayer Trio. Three must be better than one right? Wrong. I was disappointed in this CD. Thought it was a terrible recording, (and I love live music) and felt that it was noisy and all over the place. I would not recommend this CD to any JM fan."
1,Left a bad taste in my mouth,"Just dont get it. I know guitar playing. When i hear john mayer , all i hear is repetition, nothing sincere. It is sooo obvious he went to Berkely school of music, his playing is well....too technical..not enough emotion...it just sounds fake to me. He just isnt the real deal. Its the same way clapton always sounds like an outsider, he's good just like mayer but he never had that special something to take him to the next level. Im afraid mayer shares his fate. I know i will get JM fans hating me for this review, but oh well...i dont hold the man in the same regard as they do...i just dont see what they see i guess. Everything he does on this record , in my opinion, just sounds so forced."
1,Good Luck,Never got the item (over 6 weeks waiting!). In the end I had to cancel the order.Nunca me enviaron el magazín. Al fin tuve que cancelar la orden.
5,Great reeds,Great quality !!!!And overall great sound!!!I will never use any other brand because it is truly the best!!!!
4,Essential guide for photographers and printers,Max's book de-mystifies the computer for photographers and printers used to working their magic in the darkroom. Max gives clear and simple instructions in a way that will be familar to any who have attended his workshops and lectures. An essential guide that will enable the photographer to achieve the same or better results than they could produce in the darkroom. This is the book I have been waiting for!
2,not happy,came with the back rod missing so cant use the screen. when trying to return it amazon wont pick it up like it usally does that leaves you with getting this massive thing to the post office. nightmare
3,the problem with those is that it cost a fortune to return it so you are stuck with what you have,I like the product and I think it will serve me well. I didn't like the fact that the base where the tube inserts to hold the screen has a huge bolt that happens to be located right below where the screen seats when enrolled in its casing. This design flaw results (especially for long screen like the 135 inches) in the screen seating on top of the head of the screw and getting damaged by it during shipping. Too bad because now that I have it at home it would cost me a fortune and some pain to send it back for an exchange.
5,The Fire Engine Book,I thought the pictures are very pretty!! The story is short which makes it easy for me to remember!! I love to read!!
1,I did not wantto see a musical!,"The video quality was good, but I hate musicals! I wish there was a better selection of these types of movies."
5,One of my favorites in the Liken series,"This movie teaches so many great lessons - and is so entertaining at the same time. My favorite scenes are ""What More Could a King Want"" and ""It's Great to Be the King To Be."" - fun costumes, makeup, dancing - a real musical-theater-on-film kind of movie."
3,Serves its purpose,"Bought this stand for my son's keyboard and it's ok. As my title states, it serves its purpose. Just a tad wobbly, but I guess that's expected because it holds just a keyboard.I really don't like that fact that you have to screw in the keyboard, but I guess that helps to maintain stability.Plus, because the keyboard has the earphone jack in the back, you can't sit it flush to the wall, unless you don't use the earphones (which my son does because it's too loud otherwise. BUT that doesn't have to do with the stand.Good product overall -- would definitely recommend!"
2,"Okay characters, virtually no action","As a devout fan of Elizabeth George and P.D. James, I figured this would be great company while I caught a few rays. Unfortunately, such was not to be the case. The plot, such as it is, is static, and the prose overwrought with stodgy vegetal descriptions (oh, the English and their gardens!) and infinitesimal minutiae on London geography.It was a chore slogging through it, to say the least. I will try one of her other ""genres,"" the Wexler stream, which promise more action."
3,More eerie goings on in Rendells london,"I have always thoight that Rendells books are way better than her books written under the alias Barbara Vine. Those books are just filled with characters getting killed off every other page and sometimes people are introduced only to get killed off after a paragraph or two. Rendell's book the ""keys to the street "" seems to hint that she is erasing the fine lines between her Vine and her Rendell books unfortunately. The"" Keys to the Street"" describes murderers and drug dealers going about their evil ways for no apparent purpose other than to create an eerie effect whihc in the end has nothing to do with the actual story and the way it ends. Very annoying !"
3,Pretty music..But no words,"Well, my mom bought this CD for me. I was thinking it would have the theme song and ending song and more but when I got it I soon found out I was wrong. All this CD is is instumental music! so if you want ""Wake up Angel"" and others keep in mind this CD has no words and doesnt have Wake up Angel or others. But, Its very pretty music to listen to if your drawing or doing something calm."
3,For Celtic Frost Fans,"Is It Me?,Or Is The Original Copyright Date Wrong?I'll Have To Go Dig Out My Vinyl For This One!Anyway, I Bought This Years Ago For The Album Jacket, And What I Found Was A Raw,Heavy Sound,That Was Not Being Done At The Time,The Songs Are Epic In That They Continue A Mood Throughout The Album.While This Is Not A ""Studio Pefect""Release, It Is A Must Have For Celtic Frost Fans.You Will Find That Most Of The Tracks From Morbid Tales Come From This Original Release."
4,Give the guys a chance too!,Am I the only male that read books like this and loved them as a teenager??? I can vividly remember reading this and carrying it around for an entire school year re-reading it. I think reviewers are doing the young men of this world an injustice not suggesting that they read books like this as well!
4,Good book....hard to get ahold of.,"I really loved this book as a child and wanted to own it again, but would suggest looking in second hand book stores, because paying $20 for this paperback was WAY too much."
5,One of the best stories of imagination and friendship ever!,"I first read this book when I was in 3rd grade, having found it in my teacher's book collection. I read it so many times that eventually the binding fell away, and my teacher was kind enough to give it to me. I still have that rubber-banded copy, and I cherish it. Read this book, and give it to the young people in your life - there is something in it for all of us."
2,Defective DVD tracks,The last 2 episodes were defective. The DVD player message suggested cleaning DVD. I have purchased several DVDs in the past few weeks. They have all played fine except this one. I purchased an Endust for Electronics CD/DVD/Blu Ray/Game Console Lens Cleaner 262000 but it was not able to remove or repair the problem. A review of my recent purchase history will verify these comments.
5,one of the best,"political mini series I have ever watched. Excellent acting, great back drops and doesn't go down the usual ""USA are always the good guys"" route"
2,BORING,"This was not necessarily bad, just nothing special. I love BBC series/mini series so I was very excited about this, but did not even bother to watch the second disc. I agree with another reviewer that the first 10-15 minutes are filmed in a very jerky style, almost unwatchable, but luckily that does not last long. I think it was just to add to the chaos of what is being portrayed. Also, found the story lines are kind of all over the place. If you are looking for a good mini series, try ""State of Play"" which is excellent."
5,Great series,I wish there had been more seasons. The story was intriguing and the acting good. Reminded me a little of 24.
5,Instrumental Escape... perfect after a long day.,I listen to this and all the other awesome CDs by Mehdi while driving home in rush hour traffic. They just make me feel like I don't even want to leave the car. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM ALL to anyone who wants a nice break from the stresses of life even if it's just for an hour.
4,"Good inspiration, a couple issues","As is typical for a book by an interior designer, there are a few misspellings or misidentifications of plants.But it is a well-contrived book that should inspire people who are wanting a home more grounded in the dry, dramatic southwest. The Desert Home is a refreshing change from all the Pueblo Style homes and their ""spineless"", northeast cottage-cutesy landscape choices, which is mostly what is promoted here in the Duke City."
3,suction cups?!,"i bought this to be some what of a bad ass but when i received it it had suction cups on it, i guess so you can attach it to your helmet. it was weird! so i yanked off the suction cups and used some glue to make it a bit more permanant! :)"
1,KODAK CARD READER,I got this from JnR . This unit powers up but the computer fails to detect it. I tried this on multiple computers. MAy be this was just a lemon. I will exchange it to a better brand.
4,gift for niece,My niece just loved the soundtrack. She has been wanting it for sometime. Price was reasonable and shipping was fast.
5,This CD is great!,"I have this CD and I LOVE it.The songs are very upbeat and catchy.I listen to the songs all the time now.There are very talented cast members including Zac Efron,Queen Latifia,and even John Travolta.There are even 3 songs that arent on the movie.If you want a good musical soundtrack you should deffinately get this one or if you are on the fence about buying this please do so.:-)"
4,"Great movie, great soundtrack","It's great listening to this CD and reliving the movie scene-by-scene. My favorite song is ""Without Love"" and my son's favorite song is ""You Can't Stop the Beat."" We can't wait for the movie to come out on DVD."
5,Hairspray Soundtrack,We were thrilled to be able to buy it here since it sold out so fast in the Twin Cities. We loved the movie and enjoy listening to these fun songs in the car. I recommend this CD to all ages.
5,Hairspray cd,The CD is in excellent condition and it arrived when promised. I would buy a CD again without reservations.
5,"Incredible, Amazing, and all-around Happy","This CD shows the best qualities of musicals, as this musical is one of the best of all times. It is amazing to hear John Travolta's changed voice and Christopher Walken sing happily. You feel and good and are up-lifted by the spectacular beats and rythms. You will want to listen to it again and again until you have learned all the words. If you like this, GO SEE THE MOVIE. It will blow you away; there is no wasted moment. If you liked the movie, buy this CD. You will not regret it."
5,Really cheers up the bathroom!,"The description of this item seems to say that this is something for a child's bathroom, but that really limits the potential of this very colorful shower curtain.For starters, it's high quality. The colors aren't printed on, they're woven together with different color threads into an attractive plaid. The colors are bright and sunny, which gave a real lift to my dreary white walls/white tile apartment bathroom.Instead of going for boring suburban pastels and beige, why not get one of these shower curtains and accessorize your bathroom in all sorts of colors? I picked up a lovely green floor mat, and yellow towels, and a bright orange toilet seat cover, and various decorations in red and blue, and it really looks grand and not like a child's bathroom at all! If anything it looks a bit Scandinavian with all the bright solid colors everywhere. You don't have to be dull to have an attractive bathroom. Go wild!"
1,Impossibly Bad,"I've given this album one star only because there isn't the option of giving it negative stars.To get a proper feel for this album, picture a spoiled twit with zero musical talent. Now give him a rack of halfway decent synthesizers without telling him how to adjust any of the preset voices and let him download Depeche Mode MIDI files off the Internet and play them through his new toys. Voila, you have this album.There is nothing original or imaginative about this work. The choices Mr. Huetter makes in electronic voices (he has the NERVE to call them an ""orchestra"") are unilaterally poor fits for the feel of the original tracks--parodies at best. Muzak could do better.I picked up this album at a local record store, hoping it would be listenable, and the only reason my copy isn't on the rack at the used record store is that I could neither, in good conscience, accept cash for this garbage nor inflict it upon another unwitting buyer.It does, however, make an acceptable coaster."
1,Run away as fast as you can!,"NO STARS!!! I bought one of these from Amazon in April, 2005. The first lasted a week........free replacement. The second one lasted about 4 months and quit without warning. It's obvious this product has an unacceptable defect rate. Save your money for a decent product. When it was working, it was acceptable but not great."
4,A fun series at a great price!,"At 24 episodes -- plus the box -- for just over $30, this is one of the best anime buys I've found. The series itself is joyfully mindless comedy, taking place in a Dungeons and Dragons-like world. It takes the harem formula and stand it on its head -- the three girls the main character joins would rather push him off a cliff. And the main character wants to prove himself -- except he's a tavern brawler trapped in a sorceror's profession. The series won't be recorded in the annals of otakudom as anything groundbreaking, but the series is certainly fun."
4,Fun and Engaging,"I liked this anime for the fun characters (Louie is a NUT!) and the great comedy. It takes serious moments and manages to add some comedy without turning the show into a spoof. It seems no matter how hard he tries, Louis cannot stay out of trouble.I love the episode where he gets turned into a squid!I mean, foiling a bad guys plot by 'pissing' (his words) into the magical dragon creating vat...pretty unique. Overall serious enough for the serious anime fans but enjoyable enough for those new to anime.Pros: Lots of sexual humor (without being vulgar), great characters, funCons: Too short, I would have liked to see more antics and adventuresViewing Preference: Japanese with english subtitles"
4,Good comedic fun,"This is fun, mostly light-hearted series. It is mostly episodic based making it easy to watch an episode or two at a time. There is a lot of slapstick comedy and lets just say Louie could try using his brain more (as the rest of the team constantly point out). A light-hearted, fun series that is a nice change of pace from the more dramatic and serious Anime and from the more typical fan service Anime."
2,Not so good...,"I was looking for a Tai-Chi video that would enable me to learn from home on my own. I realize that a do-it-yourself video can only be so helpful, but this one really was not worth it. It advertizes that it provides lessons, but in reality it does not. It gives you a brief introduction concepts in Tai-Chi, but never explains how one should move. The style demo is done without any explanation, so you really can't learn from it. It was a waste of money."
1,not what i was looking for...,"I thought I was getting a dvd that taught HOW to do two chi, not basically a glorified YouTube video showcasing his abilities..."
3,For the CoS-completist.,"This is not the most important book of our mighty religion and everyone should start the studying of Satanism from The Satanic Bible. Yet this book is quite entertaining to read and it is a good read, if you want to deepen your aspect and knowledge of Satanism, though for a small amount.And this for the troll called god worshipper: You cannot even understand Satanism's philosophies, and you are judging the religion by the stupid anti-Satanism propaganda that xtianity keeps stuffing to everyone's head. And your so called ''book review'' stinks of fear and nave mind."
5,Awesome story,"Buy this DVD! Steven tells an incredible story within this concert video. If you are a SCC fan then you will love the music, of course, but you will also have your eyes opened to a story only God could write. It will change your life. My wife and I saw this live and we were stunned by what we saw. I won't give you any detailsbecause you need to see this for yourself. Buy it and prepare to be moved! The video on adoption with the song ""When Love Takes You In"" is also very moving. It reminds me of what God did for me. BUY THIS even if you are not a SCC fan, you will love it!"
1,Misrepresented SIze in ad,"I was very excited about finding a large size (size 19) slipper/shoe like this product on Amazon, as they are a rare find for large shoe sizes. So, I ordered it without hesitation.What I had hoped to receive was a pair of shoes that were Men's Size 19. What I actually received was a pair of Women's Size 7-8.The more I read about the item, the more I realized the ad was mislabeled, and the actual shoes do not come in large sizes.I am awaiting a refund, and very disappointed."
1,Better off using headphones,This mini speaker has lots of volume for its size but the distortion and lack of any bass will actually hurt your ears!
3,Poor packaging,"Item came packaged in a bubble wrap envelope. It was bent along the entire top and had a 2"" scratch along the bottom. I assume the scratch was there when packaged as the envelope showed no signs of damage. The bent top was probably done by the carrier. I'm not sure a padded envelope is enough protection for a metal sign. I have contacted the shipper and will wait to see what they do about this issue.Have been contacted already about this. I will update rating once the transaction is complete. Fast polite response from shipper and willingness to take care of issues is appreciated."
3,Fair,"They were not what I expected in the picture, and there are so many different styles out nowadays, so it is hard to see what you are actually getting before you get it in your hands.The pictures on the internet are kind of hard to distinguish sometimes, so I sent them back for a full refund.Thank you for the wonderful service I get from Amazon.com.A Sataisfied Customer,Suellen Warrenjessejames2448@yahoo.com"
4,Very Helpful Resource,"This book is a great resource for those who are struggling with forgiveness. Charles Stanley is insightful and informative, touching the heart of the reader."
3,misleading information,"This product was misleading. The doctor said that it would help out with cardiovascular problems in legs. What it does not say, is that this product is simple an (outer device) that needs to be padded before applying the bandage. You have to wrap the leg with protective guaze so that it does not bind the leg. It seems that this would be written on the page before a person buys it. This product is not what I was lead to believe in either by seller or my doctor."
3,my great report,I liked this book.It had lots of cool predicaments.My favoritepart was when Huck went to the grave yard and witnessed a murder.Then they tried to solve it.
4,Overall good book,Overall good book.Lots of mistakes...not proof-read properly.Gives you the essentials to get up to speed with Struts.A chapter should have been dedicated to security with Struts IMHO.No examples with javascript embedded in it.Some provided examples are not illustrated properly..or illustrations missing(a pic is worth a..)

3,"Enjoyed ""Paper Moon"" with Tatum O'Neal","This also is a movie we hadn't viewed in a long time and one that we enjoyed the talents of Tatum O'Neal and her Dad, Ryan O'Neal. They made a good team."
5,"ADDIE LOGGINS, MAM, ADDIE LOGGINS"".",""" SIMPLY PUT ""___________ONE OF THE BEST FLICKS EVER"" AND THATS A BIG CHAW OF BACCER TO BITE OFF, BUT I WILL [ HAVE TO SAY, ONE OF THE BEST EVER].

4,It Seems Like It Might Be A Timeless Film,"I had seen this movie when I was a kid back in 1973. I remembered it as being good back then. I found the DVD for $9.99 and decided to give it a try. I was suprised that the film stills holds up and is still good. Many films become dated and are not as good as you remember them. This film is still excellent. I give it 4 1/2 stars **** Not quite 5 stars. Shot in Black and white, it gives you the feeling that you are in the midewest in 1935. It is a good movie, the acting is very good and I enjoyed watching it. It is a good buy for $9.99 and a good film for families. Tatum O'Neal is very good in her role. I recommend this film. It's still good. Just have to see how it is 10 years from now. Now I need to view ""Last Picture Show"" again and see if that is still viable."
4,Great Book,"Great book, my son is 3 1/2 and follows aglong great with the stories. We try and read it in the morning and at night as a review, illustraions great. Definatly would recommend."
5,Perfect for my toddlers,We got this for our children (2 and 4) for Christmas. They love doing their Devotional every night before bed and sometimes they're reminding me that we have to do our devotional - sometimes I forget! They surely don't. I would definitely recommend to anyone with toddlers.
2,"a sweet, simple book",This is a cute devotional. My boys actually prefer reading Bible stories each night; the devotional is a little too simple for them (they are 3 and 5). It might be better for younger kids who aren't ready for Bible stories.
4,Devotions for Preschoolers,I like the idea of a daily devotions for every day of the year. The contents are not too lengthy and just enough for little ones. There is a memory verse and short prayer at the end of each reading. Very nice and useful.
4,Inexpensive fun,"We purchased these nesting cars when our son was around 4 months old. Since each car has a function that appeals to a child at different stages (the rattle on the green car and the police car's rolling light are both good for young babies, while the moving parts on the bus and fire truck are interesting for older babies), not to mention the fact that they can be nested, stacked, ordered, and identified by color/number, this is a toy that truly grows with your child!My only complaint is that the eye decals should be a little more durable. Our set still looks great, but I have to be really careful when washing them."
2,"don't stack well, don't roll well either","The cars stack but tenuously enough that the slightest bump knocks them over. Worse still, the wheels do not spin well so that the cars do not go nearly as fast as a hot wheels or even one of the ""little people"" cars."
1,DIDN'T EVEN LAST US 2 USES,"I bought this for my 6 and 3 year old children. They loved it but it only lasted 2 uses (about a 1/2 hour each time) before it developed a gaping hole along the plastic seem of the slide. We had owned it for less than a week. In between uses, we emptied it of water and stored it in our garage, out of the heat and elements. We also put down a plastic tarp for the slide. My children were very disappointed. We returned it and bought a nine dollar slip 'n slide at W*l-M@rt. Do not buy!"
1,"Not Durable, or as big as it looks in picture","This product looked so fun. I have a 4 and 2 year old and they did have fun on it. However, it is rated for 5-15 years. No [...]year old would fit on this. I would say ages 2-10 maybe. The slide part would not stay up due to plugs not staying plugged therefore the water that you are supposed to weight the bottom down would not stay in. Also the plastic is not durable at all. Grass clipping punctured it with just one use. Too bad it was not made better because it would have been a fun thing for hot days."
4,The kids loved it.,"We got this waterslide as entertainment for my son's 10th birthday party and it was a hit with all the kids there. everyone really enjoyed bouncing on the elevated slide and even though the sprinkler system didn't work properly, it held up to 13 kids taking flying leaps down the ramp. I think better construction could have been done with attaching the ramp to the pool-- the velcro kept slipping loose causiing the water to drain down the side instead of into the pool, but the kid's didnt seem to mind. I would recommend buying extra inflatable boogie boards, like we did. Saved us lot's of headaches. All in all... if the kids liked it, I love it."
1,Terrible!!,It is SOOOOOO small my 5 year old said send it back. We returned it as soon as we opened it!!It would be appropriate for a 3 year old
1,Do NOT purchase this piece of junk!,"This should have been a lot of fun, but it is poorly made. Instead of the water shooting up and landing on the slide, it shoots off into the lawn and misses the slide area. The holes should be along the top of the slide, but they are on the side. Any amount of water pressure sends it shooting off into the yard.I called the 800 # and they sent a replacement slide, but this one is no different.The water shoots off into the lawn instead of on the slide. So, we set up a water sprinkler next to the slide to wet it down.I would NOT recommend that anyone purchase this. It is very poorly made and not as much fun as a ""Slip and Slide""."
2,Fun toy while it lasted,"I purchased this item for my sons, and they had tremendous fun until the seam where the water comes out tore. Now they can't even use the slide because the tear seams to get bigger when I turn the water on. So all that remains usable is the pool part. Great idea, but disappointed that it didn't hold up."
4,Great Fun!,Cannonball Splash Water Slide Includes Boogie BoardWe are having a great time with this waterslide. We had a problem of the water running onto the ground instead of in the pool so I propped the slide up onto the pool. My kids are six and three and it was perfect for them but I think its too small for bigger kids.
3,It is what it is...,"I bought this slide locally for $[...] about 2 weeks ago. My children are 12 and 7. No, this is obviously NOT the big Banzai slide--at one tenth of the price I would not expect it to be. It is in our opinion just another Slip N' Slide type of water toy to add to our stash for the summer. My children really enjoy it. I see a lot of complaints about tipping over the side. Yes, that happens occasionally. Once the kids figure out how to get lined up just right though, there is much less tipping over. It does not work without using the inflatable boogie board. Don't bother to try. The sprinkler part does not spray onto the slide if your water is turned all the way up. Turn the water down and voila--it sprays on the slide and runs into the pool. We always fill the pool part first also.My kids are having a blast with this. For us, it was worth the $[...]. It is what it is--an inexpensive way to cool off in the summer."
1,Bad Buy!!!!!!!!!!,I bought this..looked like it would be fun for the kids.....1st...When they go down the slide it would detach from the pool part!2nd...The left slide would not stay aired up!3rd...When the kids used the body board that came with it to slide on..it wouldn't slide and if you could get it too it just went off over the edge!!!4th was a hudge hudge hudge waste of money and time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Good for 1 Day of Dangerous Fun,"I bought this pool for a playdate for my almost 3 year old son and his 3 1/2 year old buddy. First one side of the slide already had a hole in it as it kept deflating over and over again which made the slide totally unsafe. We had to take the kids and forcefully throw them down the slide because if they were to do it themselves they would fall off the side. Then the rest of thing thing had holes by the end of the day. So yeah, if you don't mind spending $50 bucks for a day of fun then go for it. The kids did have fun though, I'll give it that...but 3 year olds also could have had just as much fun if we stuck them in the bathtub."
1,Not worth it,"I bought this for my 9 year old son's birthday party. First of all, I'm a chick and am not good at diminisions, but the pic on the website/box made it look bigger than it was. This wasn't a big deal, but when the kids started playing on it, it lasted about 20 minutes. I was furious. I figured it would have at least lasted an hour or so. It developed a hole in the slide part which filled up with water and would not attach nor stay up because of water weight. Very big disappointment."
1,"Sized for Little Kids, Meant for Big Kids","This slide looks really fun and is recommended for kids 8+. My 8 and 10 year olds are too big for it. The slide is too short, they need to run and jump onto it. The pool is too short, the kids soar off the end. The sprinkers don't work very well - they shoot in crazy directions. The water that does make it to the slide ends up on the ground, not in the pool. The slide isn't stable and doesn't stay attached to the pool. I'm not sure who this toy would be good for."
2,Stay away from it,"First 5 minutes into the fun the slide went pop! Also,slide is attached to the pool by 3 small strips of velcro and it constantly detaches from pool. I am still waiting for my refund from Amazon. I just returned the package couple days ago and I am not sure if they will refund at all."
3,Technical enough for CLI only.,"Not cover 10g too much. Majority of the contents were duplicated from 9iR2 oracle metalink notes . Authors only cover Dataguard broker (CLI) by few topics . As matter of fact, this make me disappointed.The writers like to subsitute the Oracle manual in OTN but make no difference . eg, I wanted to setup the Dataguard through EM10g Grid Control. In fact , the creation standby database wizard was filled of bugs and user can't make use of it till patching and huge manual works. It's no doubt that writers never tried on this features. The book is rather splotchy and winding."
3,Not very original and not very refined.,"It's a mediocre album showing this band really hasn't acquired their own sound to sell. Bands like Onesidezero and Flaw have occasionally catchy beats, but they are ruined by the redundant play and poor vocals. This is an okay debut album, but it really doesn't explore anything new--a SOAD, Nickelback sound. There are a few good songs: underground, new world order, and eight; but for the most part, it's nothing unique."
2,A great cd...for me to step on!,"Wow just wow after one of my mtv band listening friends I went to the store and bought it thinking it would be good. But as I turned on the cd I heard nothing but awful singing,boring bland lyrics,and sub par guitar playing. The music sounds like everything else on the radio the same old bull nu-metal that gets more and more POPular everyday."
4,Melodic Metal Breaks through,"I've been a listener of Modern Rock/Melodic Metal for over 8 years now. I run my own Music Promotion biz in Metal. I listened to this cd and was tossed to the floor! Amazing combos of guitar riffs that rip, drums that batter, and vocals that Soar. Onesidezero comes through with it's own sound in a world of cookie cutters. Sure, you may hear influence, but try to name just One band recently who HASN'T been influenced....There isn't one...Even Slipknot has influence. The trick is to avoid showing off the influence, and Onesidezero does a great job! Are you into Tool, Staind, Chevelle? Then buy this CD, you'll fall in love immediately."
5,Great all around CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Last year I had no idea who these guys were. Then I saw them when I went to see BoyHitsCar (also great band) and was blown away. Their performance in my mind was so good I hadn't seen one like it since I saw Staind. If you like Staind, then you must buy this CD. The lead singer has a perfect voice for being both, loud, and soft. The best thing about the band is most songs are made with the use of three guitars, which creates a fresh new sound and gives off an original feel to the band, and to top it off the sounds from the drummer and bass guitar are out of this world. They are my new favorite band. This band will become a very big hit as soon as the public hears them. PICK THIS CD UP!!!!!"
3,Pretty good...,"Well, 3-3.5 stars. I enjoyed this album, it has good songwriting, together insturmentation and solid vocals. That, however is really all there is to be said about it. Certainly worth listening to, but nothing remarkable."
4,The kids loved it,"I recently was in the cast of A Christmas Carol and as opening night and the holidays rolled around I was looking for an appropriate gift for the kids in the show. I got this book for each and the reviews were terrific! Each one told me how much he/she loved it. It kept them all busy for several days during their off-stage time, both reading and discussing with eachother. It was a fun comparison to the Dickens which they now knew so well. I say get both and start your own Oprah style book discussions with the ""juniors"" in your house."
3,Description without Direction,"I was very excited to read this book after writing a 20-page paper on the settlements described in the book, the ""gecekondu"". However, the book was disappointing. There were beautiful parts, such as the opening when the young girl plays on a mound each day as the bulldozers come and soon, there is no houses around but hers made of tiny sticks. Also, there is some important commentary on the environmental problems of the shanties, dealing with water quality, and what happens to the villagers has a fairy-tale like, colorful outcome, tragic but also magic. However, I finished the book unchanged. I felt I hadn't met anyone new, I took away little. Latife Tekin is well-revered in Turkey, I fear the translation was poor."
2,very disappointing,"My daughter's grandparents bought this for her when she was about 4 mo old. The keys are very hard to push and it didn't hold the interest of my daughter for more than about 2 minutes. It drains batteries very quickly and now it doesn't even make the sound it is supposed to . It sounds like it had a meltdown. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I, as was my daughter, was very disappointed."
1,Save Your Money,"This toy cost me (money) and unfortunately it was a waste of money. We bought this for our son for his Xmas present when he was 2 months old. He paid no attention at the time. He is now 2 years old and it has hardly ever been used. We have had the piano attached to his cot, the lights were exciting for him but the music is just too loud. I can hear it down the end of the house which makes me worry what would be happening to his ears.It is a great idea, the sound needs to be turned down quite a few decibles. Maybe if it was a little quieter my son would have used it.We have another new baby now so hopefully he might like it - otherwise it is definitely going to be a waste of money spent as not even my daughter enjoyed the toy and she is now 4.Sorry - but I recommend that you save your money"
3,Want to make your baby hard of hearing? Use this toy!,"The different settings for different stages is definately a cool feature of this toy, however, I have two complaints. The First is that there is no volume control on this toy - it practically blasts my little man out of his crib, save for when the batteries are on the brink of death. The second is actually a ""feature"" of the toy that I could live without, it boasts that after a certain period of inactivity (I think its about 1 -2 min.) it will make more sounds. This is fine if the toy is only switched on during playtime. If your kid falls asleep while playing with this toy (as mine has), be prepared to have them awakened....loudly."
2,Not a great crib toy,"I was very disappointed in this toy. The idea is for the infant to lie on their back and kick at it to make noises sound and lights flash. Unfortunately, since my infant -as well as another infant I take care of -could not see what they were kicking at, their kicking was never reinforced. In addition, even when the toy was placed in the crib at the lowest possible position, I found that the infants kicks were higher, missing the keypads altogether. Once the babies were mobile I removed it from the crib to let them play with it on the floor. Even with my help the toy couldn't keep their attention for long. I do have to admit, however, that my 1 year old enjoys walking on it now and again. We're still trying..."
1,Useless waste of money,"I bought this toy for my first daughter who is now 22 months old. She has yet to play with it. She couldn't see it well enough when she was an infant lying on her back to enjoy it, and the foot power required to make it play is really greater than my kid could manage. Once she sat up she had no interest in it either. I thought it might just be her but my second daughter, who is opposite in temperament and personality, also finds it pretty boring.Some of the biggest problems with this toy are:1. it has NO VOLUME CONTROL. And it's loud. And annoying. I had to put a piece of tape over the speaker to bring it down to a tolerable level.2. it's made of fabric and gets grungy really fast when you put it on a floor or table for your toddler to play on.It really misses the mark for toys. Get a Peaceful Planet Aquarium instead, now that's a great toy!"
3,Just one problem...,"This a great toy for young children. I have a two month old and he is able to trigger the keys with his little kicks. The problem with the toy is that in order to kick it, the baby has to be laying on his back. Then when the lights go off the baby can't see what is happening. If you turn on the song portion and lay them on their side then they can enjoy the lights, but you can't do both. He does like the sounds, but the lights are useless if they are really kicking the piano because they can't see them."
3,I'm disappointed and my baby plays less than 1 minute.,"I thought this would be a great toy, but my 8 month old plays with it for less than one minute a sitting. The music is very soft and doesnt capture her attention over her brother running around. Had I not thrown away the box - this would be back at the store. Not a bad toy, but a waste of money for my child."
2,Not pleased,"I'm glad other people got their money's worth, but my son just wasn't amused. He never was interested in kicking it in his crib, when he was old enough I put him on the floor on this stomach and he played with it less than 5 minutes. It seems like its well made. I like you can turn the volume up and down. It just didn't keep my son entertained."
1,useless,"I searched high and wide for a crib toy that my son can play with and kick around to keep busy when he was 3 months. since the day I bought it, he had virtually very little interest in it. I can probably count how many times he looked at it. The keys are too difficult to press with even his little feet so there is basically no music coming from it. Moreover, the only way it would play any sounds at all is only if you leave it on all the time, and course,waste all the battery power. The animal sounds and other peculiar sounds are silly and do not spark any interest even when he was 6 months. This toy is a waste of money and time that I spent hunting for a good crib activity toy. I don't know why it is so highly rated."
3,hard as a rock - best for older babies -not very interactive,"I returned it! Our baby was too small - she never played with it - didn't even notice it - kind of loud but it had lots of different songs. The light show was like Christmas. The case is hard - like a rock with a pillowcase around it. My baby is older now, but she tends to kick her legs up into the air, not out. Laying down, she wouldn't be able see it light up anyway, which makes it no more interesting than a radio. Doesn't really resemble a piano either. A better musical instrument is the elmo guitar - you can make the songs play at different speeds, all at once, or in parts, and baby can turn a big wheel or push buttons."
1,My baby is not satisfied with her kick and play piano,on tv this looks like a great fun toy for a baby. when actually it is not. the lights are too small for her to see and the music only has one setting so if she is whining it doesn't get her attention. i don't feel that it was worth the money i spent. my local walmart never got it in stock so i ordered it on the internet which cost a nice fee for shipping and handling. my recommendation is see it in person before you buy.
4,needs some improvements,"this toy is a good toy, but to be a great one at our house it needs a volume control. and a better way to secure it, the ties that you tie it to the crib with are too short, my son would either kick the top of it or kick to low. we could never get it adjusted to the right height."
4,Not interested,We bought this before the baby was born. He didn't care about it then. Was not interested in kicking it. He did like listening to the music. Finially I put it on the floor and he would play for a minute or two. he liked the animals sounds. At one year he still could care less about it.
2,Disappointing and Frustrating toy,"This piano is designed so that the baby lies on their back and kicks at it to make noise... which means the baby cannot see the toy at all. My baby searches for the source of the sound and because she cannot see the toy she does not really understand what is going on. When she sees the toy, she naturally wants to move her body to look at it directly, but when she moves her body around to see the piano she can no longer play it. What frustration!"
4,A must have,I bought this for my son when he was a month old. It was an instant hit - I would hit the keys for him and he would fall asleep to the music. At about two or three months he was able to activate the keys with his own kicking - my husband and I woke up a few times to the music. When he started daycare I bought a second one for his crib there. He's now almost one and loves to play with the piano on the floor by pressing the keys. This is a must have for all new parents.
4,Speedos,"Exactly what I was looking for. Son wanted ""wrestling underwear"" for Xmas lol. Briefs fit perfectly. Would buy again for sure"
5,Unforgetabble,"You don't have this DVD yet ?What are you waiting for ?If you're JP fan, you'll be paralysed when you see one of the most spectacular heavy metal performance.Sound is perfect, no more than 5 or 6 cameras that show us complete stage, artists, audience in very rare shots.I've never seen any other DVD like this and I'm heavy metal/punk rock fan for almost 30 years.I bought all DVD from JP, but this one is the jewel of collection."
3,Dance~,"Girls will love the look of the innovative Pillow and Playset Assortment! The Dance Playset transforms from a square purple pillow into the high school gym decorated for the fall formal, just like in the movie. There's a backstage dressing room where the ""CHARMZ"" band can get ready as well as all the fashions and equipment to ensure a rockin' performance...Only the BARBIE doll from Barbie Diaries can perform. Her friends can't because they don't have their equipment=("
1,From one side of the ditch to the other!,"This is just another book among many lately that are attacking the pre-tribulation view of the rapture of the church. The bible clearly teaches that the church is not appointed to wrath. Matthew 24 is not talking to the church, but to the Jews. Many get this wrong, and Jim Baker did too. Readers beware, maintain a literal interpretation of the Bible, and watch out for the Kingdom Now, Covenant Theology type of teachings which are continually spreading. They teach no rapture, no millinium, and no tribulation. I think Jim Baker is beginning to embrace these beliefs."
5,LaCrosse Tech Strap Watch - Amazon Service,"Was pleased with the product. Price was excellent and Amazon's service was super, too. Will continue using service as need arised. Thanks..."
4,Simple But Fun,"We have owned a few sets of Snap-Lock Beads.The Snap-Lock Beads come in a box of twelve. They are plastic and come in different shapes and colors. The colors in our set were orange, yellow, blue, purple, green and red. The shapes in our box were cylinders, hexagons and egg shaped and each bead measures about three inches long. Each bead has a knob that sticks out of the one side and an opening on the other side that the knobs fit in to. The idea is to snap the beads together to make a rope of beads. Once you assemble the beads you can pull them apart and start all over. You can build them into a rope or even a circle.The Snap-Lock Beads are easy to clean and are educational as they help with color recognition, shape recognition, they help to develop fine motor skills and hand-eye coordination.Both my boys loved the Snap-Lock Beads and I would recommend them to others."
5,Inexpensive and Useful,I think this was an excellent toy for my sons to practice their fine motor skills.
3,2 year old boy,"He wasn't really interested in them after the first time he played with them, they ended up all over the house and under furniture!"
3,Very academic.,"Cichlid fishes have personality. Every home aquarist knows this. However, this book, long on fact and science is short on explaining why these fish do the things they do. In the last chapter, the author editorializes about how if bad things can happen to fishes then bad things can perhaps happen to mankind. But, I've always viewed cichlid fishes as one of the happy things about life and not as a metaphor for our doom. Perhaps the author would be better served with a tankful of guppies."
1,Not worth the absurd cost- very flimsy,"I got just over one hour of use out of this valve before it simply stopped working. There is nothing visibly wrong with it, and no clear way to fix it. Now, when I depress the cheapo pressed-sheetmetal lever the gas supply shuts off and the flame extinguishes. I recommend the much simpler and less expensive dial control valves seen on the older flaming wands. They work for years, are less fragile, and very easy to control. They also cost about $6 at the store."
1,It ain't happening for me,"It's such a poor CD, there are so many better soul girl group's out there. Get En Vougue's Soulflower instead."
4,very good to excellent death metal,"this is a mix of incantation, possessed, and morbid angel; that is to say, very good death metal. excellent pocket grooves with not too many blast beats. good cover art reminiscent of hell awaits and blessed are the sick."
1,Wrong Item,Instead of the actual Child Development hardcover 7th edition by Berk I received the 3rd edition study guide. So I would say not to buy from this seller because they take your money and send the wrong product.
