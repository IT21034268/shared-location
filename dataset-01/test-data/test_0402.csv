1,Defective by Design,"July 20th 2009, hundreds of Amazon Kindle owners awoke to discover that books by a certain famous author had mysteriously disappeared from their e-book readers. These were books that they had bought and paid for--thought they owned ....You want to know the best part? The juicy, plump, dripping irony? The author who was the victim of this Big Brotherish plot was none other than George Orwell. And the books were '1984' and 'Animal Farm.'"
2,CAREFUL - Text-to-speech buyers,CAREFUL - I was originally extremely pleased with my Kindle. I now find that many current releases have Text-to-speech disabled. VERY disappointed as this was Amazon's BIG sales pitch when I purchased. If you're intending to use Kindle for Text-to-speech - think again.
1,Too Orwellian for me.,The fact that Amazon can and has proven they are willing to remotely delete files off of this device guarantees that I will never ever buy one.
2,This is improved version?,I was all set to buy myself a Kindle 2 for Xmas. Then noticed it no longer has an SD expansion slot and the battery is not user replaceable any longer? These are considered improvements by Amazon? I guess I will wait for the Nook and read some reviews for it. I will not buy another electronic device that I can't even replace the damn battery. Did that with the iPhone and will never do it again.
4,Great product. Could stand more functionality,"Great product. Flawlessly performs as advertised. I save money on NYT and FT subscriptions and have instant access to most of the books I want to read. (Although not all books are available.) Battery charge lasts more than a week for 2-3 hours use per day. As an attorney, I love the ability to send pdf files from the office to my Kindle.A little more functionality would be nice. For example, a calendar or an email application would not seem beyond its capabilities. However, I am delighted with the product and, even though it is pricey, it is worth the investment."
3,"too much, but awesome",The screen on these things is pretty amazing! Now bring the price down $200 and I'm sold. I can hire someone to truck around all my books in a wheel barrel for $360!
5,Kindle,Love the Kindle... Came in a timely manner.. and Amazon had dropped the price and gave me a credit for the difference! Thank You Amazon
5,no longer dubious,"Being a book lover, and enjoying turning the page to see what would happen next, I was dubious about reading on a Kindle. But with an upcoming 2 week trip, I didn't want to fill my suitcase with heavy books (darn airlines), hence the purchase of the Kindle. LOVE IT!!! It almost feels like holding a paperback book without having to use two hands to hold it open, and I still get the thrill of ""turning"" the page. One problem is my husband sometimes co ops it. Maybe we will have to buy a second one!!"
1,"It was great, while it worked.","I LOVED my Kindle. However 15 months after I got it it inexplicably stopped working. I contacted a Kindle customer service representative who told me to restart it. When that failed, she said she could send me a new one for a $135 service fee. I got this as a gift, but my dad spent $350 on my Kindle (bought it when they first came out). I've probably spent $500 for books in the past 15 months. And the only solution they have to offer is for me to pay $135 for a new one, when their machine only lasts 15 months???? I am telling you, as I tell all my friends, go to B&N or buy an iPad. Unless you're into throwing away money..."
5,The BEST gift ever,"My Mothers eyesight is failing but she loves to read, and the thought of not being able to enjoy her favorite pass time was really depressing her. This was the perfect gift. I can adjust the phont size as her sight deteriorates and when she gets tired she can listen instead. My Mother is 84 and this had added so much joy to her life.The only down side is the keyboard. The buttons should be raised just a little for easier use.Other than that I would recommend the Kindle to everyone....I already have."
2,Opps,"I purchased a Gen 1 Kindle and liked it so much I decided to purchase the next generation for my wife and Opppps, a big mistake. For one we found the battery is NOT user replacable, the screen is not back lit making it difficult to read outdoors and the media is not compatible with gen 1, requiring an ""conversion"" making the media incompatible with Gen 1.. There is no provision for a memory card as there is on Gen 1, making media storage problematic when we travel. And lastly we couldn't Jump ahead without scrolling page by page. My wife complained about the placement of side buttons. She said it wasn't as balanced as the generation 1 Kindle. I returned it for a refund and will look at the other e-book products for my wife. Lastly, at the price of this Kindle I expected at least a cover to be included with the unit. I just spent close to 400.00, to ask me to spend and extra 50.00 on a cover just rubs me the wrong way."
1,Gadget queen reply,"thanks Gadget Queen!! You have kept me from spending hard earned money on an inferior product. Best review out there!!!! Everybody should read your review, especially the compnay that makes the Kindle2. Thanks again for your help. I am sorry that you had to pay the price to help people like me!!"
3,Need Kindle 3,"Kindle 2 is absolutely an improvement, better button placement is number 1. But the removal of the SD card slot was a mistake.And one thing I really would love to see, is a stylus or some type of drawing ability. Maybe that's impossible, but when I make notes, I tend to draw circles or arrows. That would be the way to get my money for the Kindle 3.But Kindle 2 is still a pretty good device... for now."
1,louis9999,"I bought a Kindle International for one of my friends last month.I loved Kindle!I used to enjoy Japanese fonts using unicode.Unfortunately, Kindle International does not support(maybe ""allow"" is a suitable word) Japanese characters from version 5.X.For Japanese who are not good at English, I can not recommend you to purchase any more.You can buy after Amazon allow us to use Japanese fonts.It's NOT ""Kindle international"" any more!louis9999"
4,Love hurts,"I do indeed love my Kindle - so much so I bought one for my son and have recommended it to many others (and my brother bought one on this recommendation). The screen is so very easy on the eyes and I can set the font size so I don't need my reading glasses. I have really come to enjoy the 'Read it to me' feature as I just read along with it and I find that it maintains the pace at which I read as before I might drift away from the story for a short time and need to re-read that section. It is easy to hold and I find it much easy when reading in bed since the thick paperbacks are hard to comfortably read when propped up on one arm.The reason I say Love Hurts is that I purchased these Kindles for USD$259 and soon after the price dropped markedly to USD$189. It would have been nice for Amazon to say - as a thank you for being an early adopter in this growing market, we'll offer you an extra 20% off your next 10 e-books. I would love it more in that case."
4,how I felt about kindle,"I like Amazon Kindle, it make you can buy cheaper books on Amazon.com. But somehow is hard to read other type ebook on kindle."
5,Loving my kindle,greatest invention ever made for readers my only problem with it is that it is so delicate and i use to share books with my friends and vice versa but now if they wanna read the ones i have on my kindle they have to buy them on their own because if they broke the kindle on me it would cost an arm and a leg to replace
5,I love the Kindle,I love love love the Kindle!! I purchased it two days before Christmas and I haven't put it down since. I never leave home without it. It is so light weight and the display is so easy on the eyes. Its very best feature however is the ability to download any book you want in less than 60 seconds!! Instant gratification.
5,Excellent,"As I am disabled with Cerebral palsy and can not use my hands I can't hold a book. The kindle makes it very easy for me to read a book. It has given me a freedom to read more, even though I have to have my wife to turn it on and off for me. I like the way you can make the words bigger so it is easier to read. I can read not just on the computer but I can read anywhere."
5,Not a gadget person,"I am enjoying my kindle,especially the dictionary function. My one dis-like (so far) is that I can not lend my books to friends,maybe somewhere down the line Amazon could figure a way to lend out books between kindle owners"
5,Kindle 2 Review,"I LOVE this thing!!! I am able to read more than ever now. When I bought it, I thought that the text to speech feature might be nice every once in a while...but what I've found is that I use it all the time when I travel, which is very frequently. I play it through my stereo in my car. What a wonderful feature!This is a fantastic product. I couldn't be happier with it. I've missed reading so much, and the Kindle 2 has made it possible for me to fit it in to my busy life...easily.Thank you!"
4,Kindle 2,"I was like a lot of people and waited until now to buy the Kindle 2. I wish I had purchased it sooner, but oh well. I love the ease of use and I dont have any eye strain, even after reading a whole book in one sitting. I did find that some books are not available yet on the Kindle and also the pricing could be a little better, but I am still very pleased with the purchase and would definitely recommend the Kindle 2."
2,Beware of the amazon vs publisher war,I have had my kindle since Nov 2009. If you would have ask me two months ago I would have rated it a 5 star review. Now--It seems amazon and the publisher network are at war over pricing. From my blog reading it appears Amazon is willing to pay a certain price and the publisher wants more. Whatever the reason--I feel ripped off. I am now unable to get certain new releases I have been waiting for so I could read them on my kindle. If a customer is willing to pay the price for an e-reader one would think they are serious readers. I for one am willing to pay a couple bucks more for a book I want for my kindle. I feel Amazon is using me to prove a point to the publishers. I am looking at flushing the whole kindle thing and taking my money to B&N; or Sony if Amazon cant get it right. Not once have I seen a survey sent to customers who support Amazon to see what they want! Just beware before you choose an e-reader!Randall Keen
1,All Sales Not Final,"In light of the recent news about Amazon remotely deleting purchased copies of 1984 and Animal Farm (ironically), I myself have decided I won't be getting a kindle. Amazon has betrayed the trust of its loyal customers, and for that it has lost and will continue to lose a lot of business."
3,LOVE PRODUCT SOME FEATURE CAN BE UPDATED,"I LOVED THE ITEM OF HAVING SOMETHING THAT IS CAPABLE OF READING TO YOU, BUT I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE VOICE AND MONO TONE IN WHICH IT READS. ANOTHER IMPROVEMENT THEY SHOULD MAKE IS BEING ABLE TO DELETE PAST BOOKS THAT ARE NO LONGER NEEDED TO KEEP.I DO LOVE THE PORTABILITY OF HAVING A BOOK THAT YOU CAN DOWN LOAD AT YOUR FINGER TIPS AND TAKE ANYWHERE."
2,This seems strange and unnecessary,"What is wrong with a good ole fashioned hardback or paperback? I'm not adverse to technology, don't get me wrong. I swear by my Ipod - but that's just it, I can't pack a turntable with me when I'm on the move. However, I could manage to squeeze a book into my suitcase. I just don't see this surviving over the long haul."
4,Kindle,"My battery life is not as advertised even with wireless turned off. Yes, I supposedly have the latest version.Other than that, I am very pleased with it."
3,broken kindle,this is the second kindle i had in a year and it doesnt work again. Same problem as the first one. think about the nook
5,Love my Kindle,"Never had a reader before and love this one. Easy to use even for a low tech user. Had everything I needed, cover, box, charger and easy to follow instructions. Kindle in good condition."
4,Kindle is my companion,"When the price of the Kindle dropped, I jumped. After just a few weeks, my Kindle is my daily companion. I have dozens of books loaded on it, along with a few music files and a few photo files. Each morning I read an e-newspaper over breakfast. In the afternoon I frequently sit outside and read a novel. Just before bed I'm reading from my Kindle again. This fall I'll be taking my Kindle with me on a trip to Europe."
2,Current NYTimes reviewed books unavailable for Kindle available for Sony Readers,"I think I bought the wrong ereader. I just happened to check 2 books I should like to read, both light but well reviewed by the New York Times, and find they are unavailable on the Kindle. They are both available now on [...] The books are Jonathan Dee's ""The Privileges"" and Cathleen Shine's ""The Three Weissmanns of Westport""; presumably this is true for many other books. Otherwise I like my Kindle, but if books are not available I might as well have purchased a brick.(Both are Random House/Knopf) Availablity is in the end more important than price. I think this is appalling. What gives Amazon? I could understand if no ebook versions of them were around; but if they are available for other ebook readers, Amazon should aquire them for Kindle readers, otherwise they should buy back our kindles."
4,we now have 2,I likes mine so much I bought my wife one for her 76th birthday. Now we both like to read at the same time. An excellent product
4,"Very Good device, needs better interface","I have been using both the Kindle 2 and the Kindle DX since they came out as a semi-replacement for my text books. The only issue that I have with the two devices is that there are only a few different ways to organize content. I have hundreds of text books and manuals on the device, as well as many books for pleasure, and, as of right now, there is no way to categorize items into folders. Future software updates need to address this lack of organization tools."
5,What did I do without it!,"I love this product. I love that I have so many books that I carry around with me and that I can order a book so quickly after reading a review, etc. We had some severe weather here in the east and being able to order books without the wait time of traditional mail delivery was incredible!! The battery life is unbelievable. I LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT."
5,Love it! Love it! Love it!,"I love it! So portable, I can take it to the Dr. office, and on the plane. I even take it in the car when my hubby drives. Everything about it is wonderful. Can't wait till it comes out in color."
3,Should have bought the DX,"I love my kindle but I only wish I gotten the DX one. My reason for 3 stars is that the books vary too much in prices. And that there is 2.99 charge for books that are free for US customers but not international and they should stick to one price. I got the Lovely Bones for 8.56 only to find it's 4.99 it's price now. What the ???? So that's why I give it 3 stars. I hope one day that they will have kindle e-books free like a library, but I guess I'll be waiting for a very long time for that."
5,Easy to pack,"I have been traveling a lot to visit Grandchildren, etc. The Kindle is much easier to pack that a stack of books. It is great not having to worry about bookmarks falling out and finding my place again. The downloads are quick and easy. Bookmarking spots to return to are easy, too. I have a variety of books so I can read whatever I feel like. My kids are envious."
4,Great device!,"I love the Kindle. Getting new release books for the price of a paperback sold me. I've run out of room for books and I'm trying to weed out the ones I don't want to keep 'forever'. My only complaint is the background seems a little dark to me, but it is about the same light value as a mass-market paperback. I haven't tried it with the clip-on light."
5,Best Thing Ever!!,"I recieved this as a Christmas gift. I never thought I would like it as there is nothing better than curling up with a BOOK, but I love my Kindle. I have arthritis and some days holding a book is not possible, much less turning pages, not a problem with my Kindle. I have become addicted to the dictionary feature. The mp3 function is great. I even like the basic web browser. I haven't found anything to dislike about the Kindle. Had to return my first one, wireless wasn't working, the kindle support was Fantastic."
5,Awesome!,"My daughter and son-in-law gave me a Kindle for a Christmas gift. I love it! It is an awesome way to read. I have read only one Novel as of this time, but using the Kindle made it even more exciting to read. It's a very convenient way to carry books to read when I travel. I look forward to many exciting experiences with my Kindle."
1,International Beware,"I bought this for my Girlfriend for Christmas it does not do all that the US version does although still costs the same. It is not intuitive in use the, and using Amazon's Audible service causes no end on confusion as based in the UK you are directed to the .co.uk site where as the .com site seems to be the only on the Kindle, understand. Technical support is dreadful and when the can't answer a question cut you off. Amazon should not be exporting this if it doesn't work and doesn't do what is advertised."
4,Almost perfect,"I live in Greenland where new titles are not easy to get hold of so I love my Kindle2. Naturally, I download titles to my PC and transfer them via cable rather than through whispernet but the joy of reading on Kindle2 is far greater than I could have even imagined.This could easily have been a perfect product. But:Why do I have to hack it to be able to place my own screensavers?Why can't I jump from a location in My Clippings to the bookmark location in the book?Why can't I delete a location in My Clippings?When I delete a bookmark in-the-book why does the bookmark line still appear in My clippings?The pdf functionality sucks, the only work around is to save the pdf as txt (accessible txt if possible) and loose all images.The physical buttons on my kindle make a small but distinct click sound. Why? I often read when my wife sleeps...Why is the mp3 player included when it has almost no functionality?Why can't I power it through the USB on my computer?"
4,Reading more!,"I have had my kindle for about a month and am continually pleased with it. The wireless works great, the battery life is excellent and the font options are helpful. The text to speech needs work though. It is still in its development stages and that's obvious. I have just downloaded some books from (...) and an MP3 album of soft music. My suggestion to new buyers would be to buy a platform style cover as that is the most versitile. I would reccommend this to anyone who loves to read."
1,Can't get current titles,"My wife bought me a Kindle for the holidays... and I find it to be one of the most frustrating products I've ever owned. Try to find a recent release -- even one on the NY Times bestseller list. It's hit or miss. I'm reading less, because I can't access the books I want the most. The real name for this product should be ""bait and switch,"" because that's what it is. Amazon, if you're listening, I'd like to give this present back."
3,Kindle,I purchased this Kindle for my wife for Christmas. We do not have wireless access in our area and are confused as to how to download books.
4,Light???,Is there a reading light on the Kindle or do you have to purchase one? Seems like it would have one but I cannot find instructions on how to turn it on
5,Kindle,"I love my Kindle - it is a great way to read and my favorite feature is ""obtaining"" books any time of day or night without having to leave my house. I have a small problem with the ""5-way controller"" - it doesn't always give me the desired results. However, the ability to change the font easily is an excellent feature. All in all I am very pleased with My Kindle and love the fact that my overflowing book shelves will be getting a reprieve from any additional paper."
1,DRM should be removed from Kindle and ebooks,"I believe the DRM used in the Amazon Kindle and the ebooks they sell should be removed. I believe the ebooks you buy from Amazon.com should be yours, to do with as you please and that Amazon should not have the right to remove them from your Kindle without your permission, regardless of the reason."
2,Kindle2,"Navigation unintuitive. Not easy to learn and remember. Perhaps hardcopy manual might help. Primary use: Audio books for my handicapped sister. Voice is monotone and sometimes pronounces punctuation marks and doesn't always change inflection for beginning of sentence. Better than audio cd's in that there are no cd's to change, lose, etc. (That's why we're keeping it.) Amazon on right track, though. Expect better from future versions. Showed to friend who was very interested at first; now wants no part of it."
4,Feeling Gipped,"I purchased this ""new"" Kindle in March and now found out that a larger screen version would be coming out, this without indication from Amazon that it would soon be available. So the ""new"" Kindle to me left me disappointed and angry at Amazon. When I communicated with them they apologized and indicated that they would send my concern to the ""appropriate department""."
4,Light for kindle,"The light is very bright. It has two settings and I prefer the one light setting. If it is directly over the kindle, it can cause some glare, so I point it a little off center and it works great! It is a great light even if you don't have a kindle!"
1,"Kindle is great, BUT ONE BIG PROBLEM","I love my Kindle (1), but warning to those who are buying -- Amazon seems unwilling to support the product. I ordered a replacement battery in early January, and it is still not available. My original battery is still working, but if you read the reviews under Kindle 1 battery, you will see that many people have a $350 gadget sitting on a shelf waiting for a battery. When I emailed customer service, I received this reply, ""I apologize for any inconvenience this causes, but at this time 'Amazon Kindle 1 Replacement Battery' is unavailable to us. Due to high customer demand, we don't have enough of Kindle battery's on hand."" Amazon can do better, and should."
5,Best Device Ever!,"I love this product!! I am a voracious reader, but I have a bad back and shoulder. Holding up books while I am reading gets very tiring. But this product offers me such relief from my aches and pains! Plus, I love that I can store my books in this tiny product and not take up any more space in my crowded home. The best part is that I can listen to music while I read...all from the same device. It is awesome!Voice Lessons To Go v.1-4 The Complete Set"
1,no more value in owning this device,"forget it !!most new books are not $9.95 ~!!in fact, in many instances amazon sells the traditional bookfor only $1-2 more than the kindle ""book"". this coupled w/ the freeshipping (over $25.00).., WHY BOTHER W/ THE KINDLE ?????too bad !!! greed kills another promising idea."
2,Great product - not very good service Kindle UK,The Kindle is a serious piece of kit - It has bags of functions and is of a quality build. I'm sure all your US customer agree. However in the UK apart from being able to download books from your store very quickly we pay over the odds for this. We can not access any of the higher functions like text to speach. Graphics are restricted. No access to Wikki - Why is this and when are you going to roll out the full package to us .... frankly I feel I have not got what I paid for!
2,Disappointing,"I bought my kindle after watching the Oprah show.Even though the concept is brilliant, I was really disappointed that I could not purchase the books I was looking for.Especially for fictions there are only the newest books available.Otherwise I have to say that the quality is fantastic."
4,great but voice needs to be louder.,"I love this thing but when I turned on the text-to-voice choice, it really wasn't loud enough to hear over the highway traffic."
5,I love the kindle its so easy to handle!!,"I love the kindle... was so hooked and buying books and it was so hard to change that habit..but one reading my 1st book on kindle made me never want to pick up another book...its so easy to hold and handle, I love to read by the pool and holding both hands on a book to hold it open gets to be tiresome on my wrists. its so light easy to read in bright sunlight..a big plus for me! It so nice to be able to read all books on kindle with my personal chosen sized font, really small books get to be too hard to hold open and is hard on the eyes. This gives me the chance to read small print paperbacks at ease!I definitely recommend the kindle."
5,I am so pleased with this device,I have had the K2 since it came out. I wanted to wait to review it so I had ample time to test this great product. I read so much more than I did before and enjoy looking for new titles. I have found so many books that I might otherwise not have tried. The forums are so helpful. There are many free and super cheap books to supplement your Kindle library. Please don't pay attention to people who rate this item that have not actually owned or tried it. You will find that the 1 star ratings are typically from people who have NEVER even tried the product. They want to complain because they think it's too expensive. I'm telling you it is worth every penny. It is the best way to read books ever. So easy to take with you. Able to adjust the font size. Really an enjoyable product. Happy Reading!
5,Best device for anyone that loves to read.,"I absolutely adore my Kindle 2. I have read everday and have already finished two books, which I know that I would not have with traditional reading methods. The device is fast and easy to use, even for those that are not sure about technology. The Whispernet delivery system is amazingly fast and efficient. I love my Kindle 2."
3,Australian disappointment,I was very disappointed on receipt of my 2 Kindles to discover that not all new novels and best sellers were available to Australian users. Items like Dan browns new novel are not available and I cannot see why we are being short changed when it comes to book selection.
3,Kindle aches,"I received my Kindle about 3 weeks ago. I have enjoyed it, however when I read on it for any length of time, I get a headache.Would it help to return it and exchange it for the newer one that is suppose to have updated contrast, ect ??I am in a quandry as what I should do. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you. Ann R. Scott"
3,Kindle,"I love having multiple books on Kindle for myself and my children. We have loved a lot of features: changing the font, next page button on both sides, and the best is definitely the dictionary. It's so easy and quick to use! There's only a couple of things we don't like: The voice enabler isn't great. It sounds unnatural and doesn't pronounce words correctly. The biggest disappointment is the battery life. It never seems to get fully charged, and seems to be inconsistent. Nothing can take the place of ""real"" books, but Kindle is great for families!"
1,upgrade?,"i love my kindle but am feeling a bit cheated just now. purchased only a few months ago and already feel as if i have a much inferior product to the newest version without the possibility of upgrade. even the new colourful skins are for model 2 only.only apple has been this high handed in the past. particularly annoying is the 2's greater range for downloading.NOT FAIR AT THIS PRICE POINT!! as my only alternative would be to take a loss by unloading onto ebay and then repurchasing, i'm just going to take a pass on this product. maybe give it away and wait for the inevitably superior version from someone else. i'm very disappointed in amazon."
1,Not Yet,"Ok, nice half way step. You need to do this right. Take a hard look at the iphone. Its all about color! This is not rocket science. Someone on the development team...please make the leap into now. Color and the internet and magazines, pictures video etc. etc. etc. I would buy this in a heart beat if it was truly about now, but it is about 5 or 6 years ago. Its almost amazing, but not yet."
5,Kindle 2,"The Kindle 2 is an improvment to its earlier version. I have had a great time reading anytime I choose and not when I needed a book and it was not with me. The kindle carries as many books, magazines or papers as I choose. I like the ability to shop the Kindle store from anywhere I may be.......Great job Kindle!!!The customer service people are a great help when you forget to read the instructions. They are professional and understanding when I ask the ""stupid"" question."
5,BEST GADGET EVER,Kindle is the best gadget ever. It replaces a stack of books in a neat and smart way.
1,"Customer Service - Grade ""F""","Received my Kindle as a Father's Day present from my children. I've had problems with the device ever since July.I have contacted ""customer service"" over 65 times regarding the issues. In addition, I've tried to reach Jeff Bezos (CEO) more that 37 times by both telephone and e-mail combined. At one point, I was directed to someone named Erick Pullen, Executive Customer Relations. Repeated, and I do me REPEATED attempts to have this gentleman call me have been absolutely futile!Anyone out there thinking of buy this product, beware! Amazon's customer support is non-existent! And, judging by the way Amazon's executive management has handled my personal situation, it would appear that their corporate culture is both arrogant and apathetic."
1,The Ipad is coming!,"We really wanted to buy one of these, glad we did not. Just can't ignore all the detailed negative reviews. Apple will put out the Ipad next year, the Kindle will be history, they know it too. They broke the cardinal rule, people want to keep their stuff, all of it.P."
3,"Why? If you get an Iphone, you dont need this.",This is great and all but way to expensive. An Iphone OR Ipod Touch is perfect for this. You can purchase books and read them on your Ipod while your doing just about anything. I guess this device is a bit bigger so its like turning a page but its so limited. What if you want to find a restuarant or find directions to somewhere? The Ihpone and Ipod touch have soo much more capability than this very expensive device thats just for reading. Good luck and enjoy!
1,A $359 Book Holder?,"I do not own a Kindle; I have never even seen one. $359 seems to be a lot of money for a book holder, because if I want to read a book through the holder I have to buy the book as well. As it is I simply buy the book I want and read it without paying out $359 for a made-in-China gadget. If Amazon.com gave away the Kindle as an incentive for buying books, they'd probably sell many more books and make a greater profit."
1,stupid sad pathetic,The use of drm and the removal of George Orwell's books is one of the most stupidest move by amazon and i am never coming back to amazon to buy any product.Thanks for all that you have done
4,Didn't think I'd like it.............,"As an academic librarian I was pretty sceptical about e book readers after testing a few. I receved the Kindle as a fab surprise Christmas pressie from someone who thinks I'm a bit of a geek and have been pleasantly surprised.I find it very comfortable to use and don't think it takes away much from the physical sensation on holding a paperback.I did buy a sleeve cover for it as was worried about dropping it.I'm now trying to decide which books to buy for my next holiday - and loving the fact that I can choose and download whilst away without any hassle.Caroline, UK"
3,Not sure yet,"At this point, I'm still not sure about this product. For what it does, I think it is fine. But, I think it could be far better at $200 plus. As a student, and there's a lot of us, I see these being an excellent all-in-one device for textbooks, lectures and notes. If someone produces a product that allows me to write notes to its memory as I'm reviewing material or listening to a lecture, transfer text to my notes by highlighting said text, and accepted lecture presentations (power point, pdf, etc) and allowed me to make notes on those lectures, then that would be something I don't think I could resist so long as it had a bigger screen (8.5 x 11)..."
4,Life Changer,"When I first heard about the Kindle, I was pretty sure I would hate it. I was one of the many people who hated the idea of reading on a screen, loved everything about paper, blah blah blah. But then it goes on sale several years later, I say what the heck and try it, and now I don't want to live without it. I mean I could live without it because I'm not that big of a spoiled brat, but I would much prefer to have it in my life. It just makes reading easy. Simple as that.A couple minor things about it that need to be changed: for the price, we should be able to share books; I just read Cloud Atlas by David Mitchell and I lost count of the missing punctuation marks (mostly periods), which made things a tad confusing at times.I have changed my mind and learned to embrace the Kindle, with its imperfections, and I'm pretty sure y'all will too."
4,Needs Shortcuts for next/prev/home buttons,"The buttons on the kindle are noisy, cheap feeling and irritating. The noise could be dealt with by providing a noiseless alternative, shortcuts on the keyboard. Please give us those shortcuts Amazon, they must exist!!Otherwise its a great device. Overall glad I bought it. Ideal for the train commute. I definitely do NOT miss the newspaper, with the cost saving I buy kindle books. I doubt it is for reference text where you need to flick through. But great for fiction and news."
4,Book Cost Contrast Negative,"Love the Kindle. I have been getting e-books ever before the Kindle. They have come a long way since the early days.K2 contrast and rising cost of ebooks are the only negative things I can think of. I sincerely do not understand why the cost of e-books is going up, there is no real cost to produce the e-book -just copy the file and put in the electroic security. Anyway great great product. If you are like me, download a lot of books, then consider the cost of each book which is increasing."
3,JB,Grat reader. Had some trouble with the 5 way controller and Amazon is working we me to solve the problem.
5,How to get a non-reader to read more!!!,"I've always been a terrible reader but this thing MAKES me WANT to read!!! I have hundreds of books around my house with a bookmark within the first 100 pages where I lost interest or got ""intimidated"" by only being 50 pages into a 600 page book. The Kindle changes that. #1 the device really disappears and it's just you and the words. #2 because there are no page numbers, you lose the concept of ""how much do I have left.""This would be a great product for anyone who is a gadget-freak, a book-worm, a regular airplane passenger, or anyone who wants to find an excuse to relearn to enjoy reading."
4,"nice to have, not a need to have","I purchased the kindle for my wife. It's nice because it reduces books around the house. However, it does take some time to get use to reading. The down loads only work when you are close to a wireless network. Holding the unit takes some getting use to as well."
4,I like my Kindle,"The Kindle has definitely changed the way I read. I find the ""test-to-speech"" option helps me to focus on what I am reading. My mind tends to wander. I do think the voice needs a little work and sometimes the pronunciation of words are off. All in all it is an amazing and affordable electronic convenience."
5,best toy,"this is the best toy ( along with the iphone ) i've ever had. Seriously, as an intelligent person with auditory perceptive disorder (a variant of ADD) this is the perfect device. Simple, visual, and it allows me to jump from journal to magazine to book in seconds, which is just the kind of reading I've always preferred but couldn't pull off easily without this device. Its flawless, fun, and has opened up doors long ago closed. Thank you. Nice work guys."
1,Kindle for Christmas present,"this is my 2nd purchase of a Kindle. I love mine so much i purchased one for my dauhter in law for Christmas and am thinking of getting one for my son too. It is so convenient, easy to carry around and easy to upload new book purchases. I took it on a 3 week cruise and it was so much nicer than carrying abunch of books. Thanks Amazon - this is the best electronic reader."
1,Will not download books,"The Kindle 2 is very cool, but it refuses to download books. We have received a replacement Kindle, and still the same problem. Tech support is great, except they can't fix the problem. What's going on, Amazon?"
5,We love our Kindles!,Keep going Kindle team! We love what you're doing. Can't wait to see what you come up with in the future. Our purchase of books has already taken a big jump - and it was big before. We finally don't have to plan an extra wing on the house to store them all!
3,Like it but some issues,"I like the Kindle 2's design. However, I don't like the removal of a memory card slot. I bought this device to reduce the load of technical books I carry to work. I've already filled the device with just a few books (because technical books are normally much larger files than your basic novel). Also, the idea of using this device to play audio files along with reading books is ridiculous. There's not enough memory on the device. I like the Over the Air download/buying but it does drain the battery sometimes very quickly."
4,Kindle,"This is an easy to use product, much preferable to a hard cover, and somewhat preferable to a soft cover.It is especially convenient when traveling.Why didn't you include a light? Might make it a five star."
3,About Kindle from a reluctant user,"I was reluctant to buy an electronic book reading device because I feel much comfortable with real books, than on a PC or laptop screen. However, from its size and convenience, plus a great discount, I bought Kindle I find it rather nice, although a bit heavy to the hand and unconfortable to handle when reading on the bed. I was a dissapointed when I found out that reading pdfs was not that easy, as one cannot make it fit the screen to read if letters are too small. Only special formats automatically do so. I planned to read my scientific papers in pdf on the Kindle while traveling, but it will not be possible. I also found that I could only buy books while in my country of residence, and that the titles available there are not the same as elsewhere. However, I am sure that as the selection becomes larger, I will be able to read those books I want, at a fraction of the price I used to obtain them in print."
5,I'm in LOVE!,"The Kindle2 is my first electronic reader and in less than a week I am completely captavated! It is extremely user friendly and small enough to easily fit into my handbag. My first book was downloaded and I was reading within five minutes of unpacking the device. I do not use reading glasses but when I read in bed I love having the option of increasing the font size to ease eyestrain. I pulled my K2 out of my purse to read a few pages while I was waiting for my car to be repaired and before I left everyone in the building (including the mechanics) had asked to see it, wanted to know how it worked and were forced to listen to me gush over the new love of my life. Good job Amazon and thank you Jeff!"
2,Broken Kindle,"My Kindle broke only after two months (normal use). I get this thick bar across my screen, and does not change or refresh, no matter what I do. The text now is unreadable. As I check Amazon's site, it only says contact the manufacturer, but gives no contact information for them. Whether I recommend this to anyone else depends on how Amazon responds... Stay tuned..."
4,"Everything great, except for wireless","I must admit I wasn't sure about buying a Kindle, but I admit I was wrong, once you try it it's AWESOME! The experience is much better than I anticipated and now I'm a huge fan. The wireless functionality/delivery when you're traveling out of the US isn't what I expected but it works great within the US. In summary, great purchase (device & timely delivery)."
4,Satisfaction garanteed,"Bought this item for my wife she was well pleased ,the only drawback I can see is the range of authors but hopefully this will soon be rectified now it is on sale in uk. An excellent product"
1,Buyer Beware!,"I will not buy a Kindle until Amazon stops the practice of deleting ""sold"" books after a ""purchase"" has been made.If a brick-and-mortar book store had broken into my house, stolen my book, and left a refund on my nightstand, I'd call the cops.Who's policing Amazon?"
2,The International Kindle,"Kindle for international customers ? You must be kidding ! How can you tolerate newspapers and magazines without pictures ? I think this product will encounter a lot of backlash when this fact becomes widely known, so you might as well be prepared. There is also the matter of the missing colors.Vivecca Fujita"
1,my kindle broke after one year,"I purchased the 1st generation kindle and barely a year later, i got the ""screen of death"". This is after much care and nurturing, no overusage and well protected in a cushioney case. After speaking to the customer service agent, and doing a few little tests, like alt G and alt, shift R and put the paperclip in the reset button, he said there was a screen failure. He also informed me that my warranty had just ended. The `agent' gave me three options:1. Repair the kindle for $180.00. Ummmm....no. Doesn't he know we are in a recession?2. Buy a refurbished 1st generation kindle for $200. Now why on earth would I do that when mine barely last a year?3. Purchase a brand new kindle. Of course! What a genius idea.You know what, I will keep buying my paperbacks thank you."
2,Kindle lacks content for 14-year-old,"I bought this for my 14 year-old-daughter who is an avid reader. She likes the device (although still prefers paper books), but the first few books she wanted were not available. For instance, she wanted any Harry Potter book, and she wanted ""To Kill a Mocking Bird"" which she needs to read for school. Not exactly obscure books, but they could not be found for the Kindle. This has soured her on using the Kindle so it now sits unused."
1,The worst eReader and most expensive eReader,"I bought Kindle 1 for $[...]. A few months later, Kindle 2 came out with all new features for less money. Amazon has repeatedly refused to give me rebates. Now, Kindle 2 can read native PDF while there isn't a firmware update for Kindle. I'm stuck with the worst and most expensive eReader on earth and all Amazon says is ""sorry."" So, buy this product with your own risk. You will have the same feeling with me when Amazon releases new ones. I'm not going to waste more money on Amazon's products."
5,Kindle,This is best electronic item I have purchased in the past couple of years. I have falling back in love with reading again.
1,You are renting' not buying this product.,"be aware that if you buy books on the kindle that just as the free wireless can let you download books it also lets Amazon remove books from ""your"" device when they need (want) to."
5,Awesome Kindle!!!!,"I love this product!!!! I really did a lot of research between this and other readers. I am so glad I went with the Kindle!!!! I travel a lot and it has really been great. I can get books in just a few minutes and never had any problems, no matter where I am at!!!"
5,Nice Gift,"This was a gift for my parents-in-law. They were celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary so I wanted to get them something special for the couple that has everything. This hit the mark and then some. They had talked about making the purchase, but I'm not sure they would have ever made the jump. After a few minutes of instruction on the Kindle, they were buying their first book(s) and loving the technology. I don't think we could have made a wiser choice. They are very happy with it."
5,Love my Kindle!,I bought my Kindle less than a month ago and I have probably read 10 books since then. It is so easy to use and I love that a book is available at the touch of a button. One of the best features is the ability to increase/decrease the size of the font depending on how tired my eyes are at the moment.My only problem with the Kindle is that I am not getting enough sleep because I can't seem to put the thing down. I have zero regrets purchasing this product.
3,"Great Device, but Whispernet is a bomb with ATT","First the negative. As a Sprint subscriber one of the appeals of this product for me is that I knew I had good 3G service in my area. Surprise!! Amazon as switched to ATT. ATT's pathetic service makes the Whispernet function all but useless where I live (Southern Maine, not the boondocks). That out of the way, I love the device itself. Battery life is fantastic, the screen is very readable and the process of transferring books via USB is a snap.It took a little experimenting to find a really comfortable way to hold it, but once I got used to it that is not a problem. I wish there was an easier way to jump to ""pages"", but there is a bookmarking feature that works pretty well, so that will just take some more getting used to. Finally I love the ability to sync the last page read between the Kindle and the iPhone app. I feel sorry to only give it three stars, but the lack of whispernet is really frustrating."
1,Amazon's use of DRM,"Amazon's use of Kindle's DRM to control and monitor users and their books constitutes a clear threat to the free exchange of ideas.Amazon has already removed ""read aloud"" capability from books and deleted purchased copies of books on two separate occasions--all without users' permission and in apparent violation of their terms of service. They even deleted the personal notes of a high school student, taken while reading 1984.This power to control the exchange of ideas is unacceptable in a free society.Amazon's assurances that it will refrain from the worst abuses of this power do not address the problem. Amazon should not have this power in the first place. Until they give it up they will be tempted to use it, or they could be forced to by governments or narrow private interests. Whatever Amazon's reasons for imposing this control may be, they are not as important as the public's freedom to use books without interference or supervision."
1,Cost of books,"When the cost of the books are at or below the cost of a paperback I will consider getting one. Otherwise it is just another techie device.ChrisDanville, CA"
2,Still waiting for the product - not delivered!!!!!!!!,"After more than 30 days from purchase, DHL can not give me a date when product could (by estimate based on many similar situations they had in the past) be at my house. I am very disappointed and this is a huge inconvenient. All import duties were paid upfront and my deception is that every time I phone DHL to know if they could give me an estimate, they just say - ""We do not know. We had no previous experience to give you an estimate."" How do you think it is my desire to purchase something else into the future?"
1,Kindle and DRM,"The New York Times article quoted a student who lost his notes and annotations when the book was deleted: ""'They didn't just take a book back, they stole my work,' he said."""
3,"Great, but broken","I got the Kindle and loved it. I love the ability to buy books and have them in seconds. It is a truley amazing device. Unfortunatly I cannot do this now because the screen broke for no reason at all. Until this problem is fixed I would get a warrenty or stay away from the Kindle.(The reviewer was compensated for posting this review. However, the opinion stated in the review is that of the reviewer and the reviewer alone. Further, the reviewer independently selected this product to review and has no affiliation with the product maker/distributor, Amazon or the review requester.)"
3,problems,"the 5-way controller cracks after a while because it is easily the most stressed button on the whole machine.so i get another one, except they stopped making the old kindle 2's... now they only seem to make the kindle globals, and the internet browsing is MUCH slower. more unacceptably, the thing freezes even when i'm in the kindle store, which i'm sure they'd like would function as smoothly as butter. it keeps freezing and shutting down on me =(."
5,Love the Kindle 2,Love the Kindle 2. The battery lasts much longer than the Kindle 1. Many great options.
5,In love with my Kindle!,"Since I bought my Kindle, I've been using it everyday. I'm reading more because it's easier to carry my books around.I use to read more than one book at a time, and now I don't have to leave them home. More than once, I've been asked by other people to see my Kindle, and when they get their hands on it and I tell them how it works, they also want to buy one. Actually, I know at least two people that already bought one. My only concern is some ""shadows"" on the pages (they are words and images that I can actually see behind the words I'm reading)I wrote and had some advise but it didn't work. Maybe I got a unit that wasn't working well. Hope I would be able to get one that works better."
5,A Professor of English and the Kindle?,"As a college and university professor of English, Philosophy, and Creative Writing, I enjoy an enormously rich personal library. For years now, I have loved the smells and the touch of both old and new books. Never had I expected that such an instrument as the Kindle would be created. . .and certainly not be something I would hold in MY hand. While I must now adjust to the odorless metal and the slick touch, I am doing so with a certain relish. No, do not read that as my spreading relish on the Kindle, though I've probably already given Kat (that's my new name for her)a taste of spilled ketchsup and/or mustard. She takes it well. I am fascinated with the Kindle's speed and flexibility and finding my ability to transport personal Microsoft documents to her invaluable. She sleeps in the kitchen now, but. . . . Gary D. Swaim, Ph.D."
5,Fantastic device,"I love my kindle. I was afraid it would be like reading a computer screen, but it's not. I can read as long as I want without eye strain. It's very easy to download books and very light and compact. I am especially looking forward to taking it along with me when I travel."
1,Looking for birthday gifts again,"I had planned to purchase a kindle for each one of my daughter's as a birthday present, one in August, and the other one in November.Since I have found out that Amazon can remove data from MY machine without my permission, no thanks. I'll continue looking for a different gift.Maybe I'll get them real books of ""1984"" from one of the other bookstores, it sure won't come from Amazon."
3,Sadly,"Finally ordered my new kindle for my birthday gift from my husband. Was terribly disappointed to see the ""new"" kindle offered mere days after my kindle arrived with new features and a much lower price. I had discarded my shipping package or would have returned my device. I almost like my kindle app on my IPhone better than the real Kindle! That said, I DO enjoy my Kindle--just not as much as I expected."
4,Very pleased,"There are several reasons why I like and enjoy my Kindle2. They are;It is light weight and easy to hold. It is very efficient in ordering additional books. Amazon provides the information I need to determine if the book is of interest to me. I use the dictionary and it is very helpful. the ability to change the print size is most helpful to me. Overall, I am very pleased with my Kindle2."
2,Kindle fatal flaw: it really costs several hundred dollars per year!,"When your Kindle needs repair, and it will, and it is out of warranty, you have to pay $180 to swap it out. You get a refurbished unit with only a 90 day warranty. So you are effectively paying several hundred dollars PER YEAR for the thing. I was very happy until it died. Now I am sour on the whole thing! I feel ripped off."
1,The Case of the Missing Content,What is the point of spending big money on the Kindle when Amazon can come in on a whim and delete content like it just did to 1984?I'd rather own my property in the form of a book.
1,low reciption area,could not receive my books wirless when I called customer service I was told I lived in a low reception area. They should tell customers this I live in midwest ohio with one of the best reception area in the U.S.
1,ordering kindle,"I ordered the kindle 6 "" latest generation (2 day shipping). I also ordered the Cole Haan cover which is (7-9 day shipping). I was very disapppointed to call customer service to talk to someone who looked at my order and tell me she waS transferring me to a specialist. I waited on line for the specialist and was told he(Karlos) could not help me. If you are ordering a kindle do not order anything with it. I also ordered the warranty. It came the next day. No product but I have a warranty and still waiting until nest week July 28 for my kindle. I sure hope the kindle is worth it."
4,Great Customer Service!!,"I love my Kindle! Taking this on vacation is so much easier than lugging around a bunch of novels. My screen did lock up as I see many others' did. I made a phone call to customer service. He was so helpful with helping to troubleshoot the issue. When none of the troubleshooting tricks helped, he was able to replace my Kindle in 2 days. It isn't often that you get customer service like this. Impressive and appreciated!"
1,Amazon does NOT stand behind their product after a year expect it to die,The device seems great but conveniently it died right after warranty expired and when the new kindle came out. They want to charge me 180 dollars to fix THEIR defective product. I would advise against buying this device unless you want to spend 180 a year to have them fix their defective product.
3,I'm ready to buy a Kindle BUT.....,"I've got about 15 physical books I've purchased from AMZN that I still need to read. If AMZN let me download those books or sold them to me at a discounted price I'd be sold and ordering my Kindle today. Until then, I've got to first read my 15+ books that I've already purchased from AMZN (they could easily verify via my purchase history) which gives me time to evaluate Kindle vs Kobo vs Nook vs Sony, et al. If AMZN allowed this to happen my 3-star would go to 5-star no questions + they'd make another sale!"
4,Great but still has flaws,"The kindle 2 is everything it's cracked up to be. Easy to read and lose yourself in the book or article. However, it's too easy to click the page forward bars by accident, especially in bed when you are holding the weight of the kindle by its front and need places to place your fingers. Similarly, it's difficult to move the 5-way button left, right, up, or down without pushing it in, the fifth switch of the button. I think all of the buttons should be smaller, to leave the rest of the area for easy holding of the unit. These are serious flaws in a second version. Can Kindle 3 be far off?"
2,Truth In Advertising,"Im a Kindle 1 owner who spent a lot of money for Kindle 2 solely because it expanded wireless coverage to Montana - There is no coverage - countless phone calls and emails have led to promises, but no call backs...and no coverage - VERY FRUSTRATING"
2,FIVE stars for my kindle 2! ZERO stars for the bookstore!,"I absolutely love my kindle 2! The thought of taking a shelf full of books with me everywhere I go is heaven. In fact I only have about three books on it and I pre-ordered the kindle 2 so I've had it for a few months. Every time I go to the bookstore to find my book of choice I see that it's not available and I can let the publisher know that I'd really love to read it on my kindle but what do I do in the meantime? An example: The Brothers Karamazov-Dostoevsky-translated by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky. It's not available. Now with this book you don't want to read just any old translation. So I wonder when it's going to be available and in the meantime I guess I'll just thumb through some inferior translation and hope for the best? Nope, I'm not going to do that. UGH!!!! I could go on and on with other titles but I won't bore you. I love my kindle but I never get to use it.....for $350 no less."
2,Waiting for Kindle3...,I'm Waiting for the Kindle3. Just read to many complaints about Kindle2 from dedicated users. Hope they tweak it soon.
4,Expectation is a Verb,"As life's journey keeps us mentally sane, we experience things that surround us with comfort. Knowledge is our access to power. Technology aids us in our pathway of life. I find the Kindle to be such a helpful tool. I purchase and download books from my home. The batteries are endless and my expectation is fulfillment. I enjoy the pleasures and ease of reading as never before. I will probably have to purchase a second one as soon as my wife witnesses my ease of use. It is a very user friendly device."
5,"Kindle, Where fore art thou?","When the price of the Kindle went to $189, I quickly made the decision to purchase one. I have not regretted my decision. The Kindle is so easy to work, and the choices on Amazon for books appears to me to be superior to B&N. I do own a Nook, but I find the Kindle easier to work. While the Nook does feel better in the hands, it does not measure to the standards of the Kindle. Sure there are more free titles available for the Nook, but Google did not do a satisfactory job of scanning those books."
4,Great gift!!,"I bought this as a Christmas gift to myself. Absolutely love it! Can't believe how easy it is to purchase and download a book wirelessly. Small enough to carry around in your purse to read while waiting for doctor appts, waiting in line, etc.; yet the print is easy to set so you have no trouble with print being too small. Everyone should have one of these."
4,I love my Kindle2,I love my Kindle2. I recommend that everyone buy the kindle2 Cookbook to learn the great (and often hidden) features on this gadget. I recently took a trip and it was perfect for travelling. It is easy to store in carry on bags.My eyes never hurt when reading it and it really is easy to use. I recommend that you buy the cover.
5,"Kindle Wireless Reading Device (6"" Display, Global Wireless, Latest Generation) (Purchased on 12/06/2009)",The kindle is really neat. The screen looks like you are actually looking at the page of a book. It is really clear. My husband is using this for reading at work and he really likes it. It is easy to download the books and the prices are reasonable. Good product!
1,Overrated and Will be quickly replaced by a better technology,"Seen the device. Yawn. The major drawback with a Kindle which affects a minority of us, is that I read on Saturdays and am a shabbat observer. That rules out the purchase despite the kudos. I am not anti-technology - I do have an ipod and love it and work in Business Intelligence. It is that I spend my money intelligently and am convinced that something better and worthwhile will come along. When I find something good enough then I will purchase wisely."
4,Love it!,"I can't put it down! It's easy on the eyes and easy on the brain (if you haven't tried one that probably doesn't seem to make sense). I prefer the smaller model because it fits easily in my purse, so I can have it with me wherever I go and find myself with a few minutes to fill. It's also perfect for travel. I do wish it had a built in light and also wish the price of book downloads was less. I can't afford all the books I would like."
5,The Kindle saves me time and money,"I wondered if I would like a device rather than a bound book or paper back. I have discovered that I love reading on my Kindle. I can change the font size and put aside my reading glasses when I am on my treadmill. Being an avid reader, I used to drive about 25 minutes from home to get to the bookstore and spend over $100.00 on books every other week. I also used the library, but found the waiting list for new publications frustrating. I now buy a new book when I have finished my last purchase. I like being able to stay home and purchase selections at any time night or day. I also am able to purchase new releases for about 1/3 their price at the bookstore. At the rate I am going the Kindle will have paid for itself within 6 months."
1,Kindle Gen I vs Kindle II,"I snapped up the first Kindle, excited by the promise of ""all books $9.99."". I was thrilled with my kindle...until, very shortly, there came a new Kindle. This one was touted as being SO much better than mine that it made me almost wish I hadn't been so quick to buy it. Judging by the new features, I had buyers remorse. When I called in to see if I could perhaps trade mine up, or have a discount on the new model (as Sony does, giving buyers $100 off), I was told ""No, but you could sell yours on eBay and buy a new one."" At full price?, I asked. I was told I must pay full price, like everyone else, but, (lucky me!) me books would all be moved to my new kindle. No thanks. Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on ME! I'm through buying Kindles."
2,Fragile,After 6 months I started experiencing screen issues. The screen would fade to the point where you could barely make out that there are words on the screen - paging forward and back resolved the issue and it only happened a couple of times in the next 3 months. After 9 months of relatively light use the screen is now completely unreadable and won't reset. I am waiting to hear back from customer support about a fix or replacement. Up until this point I was very happy with my Kindle.
5,KINDLE MAGIC!!!,I love new technology. I love books. A Kindle satisfies both desires. Choice of books is stunning - some are even free! Wonderful piece of electronic wizardry and now available in UK too. Patricia
4,Happy with my Kindle,"Enjoying the Kindle - so much easier to carry and read on the commuter train than a book. Will really enjoy it on my next cross-country flight. I like that I can enlarge the text when my eyes are tired at night. The ""reader"" doesn't use the punctuation so sometimes it's hard to follow."
5,Amazing device,"I love this device. I'm an avid reader, so I wasn't sure how the transition would be.I must say it has been a very easy transition. I love the built-in dictionary and not having to worry about a bookmark. And having a book downloaded in 60 seconds is wonderful. I am in love with this device. I highly recommend it!!!"
4,really good,"I love the Kindle and have done more reading than any point in my life. It goes with me everywhere and using it any break I get. The dictionary is great and highlighting enlightening or memorable paragraphs is great.My disappointment is the number of books that cannot be accessed on line and the price of certain magazines I would love to have downloaded.The Kindle (or similar products) are the future. They are GREEN and saving trees,and no inventory of books needs to be stored.In twenty years we may wonder what happened to the library.....everything you need will be in your backpack!"
3,Internationally disappointing,"There are some major disappointments that anyone considering a Kindle should be aware of:- Books are often priced much more than you would expect to pay for ebooks. Some decent novels are $10 or less, but decent tech books seem to start at about $20.- The international book selection is disappointing at best.- Web browsing (except for Wikipedia) is not available internationally.I'm happy with the device itself but as an Australian Kindle owner, I'm very much feeling the lack of decent, reasonably priced content and am seriously disappointed about not being able to browse the web."
5,Definitely worth it,"I was hesitant to go digital since I love book books, but I'm really pleased with the Kindle. I got it and loaded it up for my 4 week trip out of the country so I could save suitcase room (not having to bring 10 books with me). The battery life has been great (especially with the whispernet turned off) and I actually think it's cool to read on it. The screen reading doesn't bother me and the ""cool"" factor of being able to read hundreds of books on the same small device has won me over. I recommend it to anyone who travels for sure, but I also think it's a gadget worth having if you're a gadget person. There are some books I'll probably still buy in hardback, but for most of the books I'll read this year, I'll download them."
1,TreeHugger,"A waste of money. Kindle version is +60% ($20) more than the paperback version. No printing cost, no shipping cost, no ability to pass along to others, yet it's more expensive? Who is the bigger fool, Amazon or the Publishers? Including us, the duped buyers, It's a three way tie for stupid."
4,Love it!,"I had been debating about buying the Kindle since before Christmas. My husband was tired of all my romance books cluttering up our bedroom, and I was running out of places to store them. I saw wonderful reviews, but hated to spend the money on myself. However, after selling many of my books I used the money to order a Kindle, and Amazon sent me the Kindle 2 in its place. The first day I had it I had to keep begging my husband to let me have ""my toy"" back because he discovered how cool it was. I love how clear and easy to use the device is. I buy books and download them immediately! I don't have worry about shipping, or storing the books anymore. The only thing I wish the Kindle 2 had was password protection. The books I buy are too mature for my kids to see, and I'm worried their curiosity will drive them to look at it while I'm out of the room. Other than that, I love this device and am already addicted to it."
4,Bad Timing,Did a lot of research on if I wanted the Kindle or the iPad. Went with the Kindle and am very happy with the product itself. The only thing I'm displeased with is - after years at the same price - it went down the week after I bought it.
1,One small move destroyed my interest,I would have bought one if Amazon didn't cripple the text-to-speech feature. You just lost a sale.
5,Kindle Review,"I love my kindle. A friend recommended it to me, and I couldn't be happier. It's easy to read, easy to take anywhere and the battery life is great."
4,LOVE IT !!,"I purchased my Kindle 2 about three weeks ago. I have recommended this to all my ""reader"" friends. I love it! It is so fast and so handy. The only reason that I didn't give it five stars was that I wish it had a built in light source. I use an attachable book light and it works fine, just adds a little weight and isn't as easy to hold. But overall I can't say enough great things about the Kindle. I figured my average monthly savings of around $68.00 in using the Kindle vs. buying hardbacks/paperbacks. My friends won't get my cast-off books now, but they just need to buy their own Kindle. It's a wonderful invention and I can't think of any reader that wouldn't love to own one of their own!"
5,Almost wonderful,"I love the Kindle, love the convenience of downloading and reading. The number of typo errors does drive this English major nuts. It just ruins the flow and mood of the story when confronted with glaring errors!"
3,"Nice, But Big Time Screen Problems","Great piece of work. It's as easy to read as a book, but I'm on my third one. The last two had serious screen malfunctions within days of purchase. Number three just developed a screen problem, as well. I'm pretty gentle with the thing, and it always lives in its case, so I'd say it's a general Kindle issue. For the, price, they need to do better.When it works, however, you will love it. With wireless off, it runs for days."
1,Disappointing poor readibility,"The background page color is dark gray, making it very difficult to read by incandescent light. Even in bright fluorescent light, text is not clearly contrasted against the dark background.The first novel I ordered has two maps at the front, and they are completely illegible.The device is very disappointing. I regret the purchase. I called customer sevice and they basically ridiculed my comments."
3,Kindle II,"Kindle meets my basic expectation. It's easy to operate. English is my second language. The dictionary function in Kindle makes my life much easier. If Kindle can be configured with different English dictionaries, it will be even better. I hope the screen can be bigger in the future Kindles. Congratulations for the product! Kindle has become my good companion."
3,Needs Way More Books on Kindle Format,"I love my Kindle and admire it's many technological achievements. I take it everywhere, I enjoy reading on it, and it is truly a marvel.One very large problem is the limited amount of material available to the Kindle. Many, many books I had hoped to buy on Kindle are not available, and only a handful of magazines. I hope Amazon can overcome this issue, because it is a problem."
4,Kindle 2,"Excellent product, totally satisfied. Encourages reading and the utime software upgrade, that's fine.A tip, continue with updates as the Kindle could be improved."
3,NOT THRILLED WITH THE CONTROLS,"The Kindle 2 is a pretty good device, but has a way to go to be considered excellent. I don't like the controls features, particularly the 5-way controller. It's too close to some of the other buttons, and is surrounded by the Menu and Back buttons. Its sensitivity makes it hard to use, and in many cases, almost impossible to use without making a mistake. So far, I've accidentally ordered several books by inadvertently touching the controller button at the wrong time. Using it to move down through the lists of items on the Home page is tedious and still subject to easily making mistakes. The same holds true for highlighting and clipping. Let's face it: the board needs re-designing to make the device more user-friendly. I've stopped using the Kindle to order my books over the Amazon network, because I don't want to make more mistakes; if I'm not close to a computer in order to access Amazon and make my orders, it can wait."
4,Close to Perfection,"This Kindle thing is propable the best thing to own by anyone into reading. The Kindle slogan should be:Kindle = Never BoredFlight Delay = KindleStuck waiting on the chicks shopping in the mall = KindleTraffic Accident road backed up for miles = KindleBlind Date Nightmare = KindleI mean you just always want it on you.....just in case and because you just do !I am using my Kindle in Trinidad & Tobago and its pretty smooth. Book selection was easy, purchase was just a mouse click and boom my book is there within 2-3 minutes.Still figuring some other stuff on it to be honest but all in all I think its revoloutionary technology and definitely the future in book reading.I think the next step is to have a internet browser on it and thats it Kindle has blown away the market !!Net books would be obsolete instantly !Welcome to the future."
4,Great for improving reading !!,The product generally is great!I only would love if you could use external files with all the functionallity without asking Amazon to format the document.
3,Needs more content,I guess I should have done more homework prior to purchasing the kindle. While it is an excellent platform. The books I was hoping to read on it just aren't available in the kindle format. It could also use some sort of back light technology. it is impossible to read in a low light condition. Don't buy if you are looking for an ROI. I don't think you can buy enough books to cover the hight cost of the product.
5,wonderful idem,"I just love this machine it's fast downloading your books and hooking up to the wireless store, so glad I got one..."
1,Kindle used to be good,"I got a Kindle for Christmas. When i got it it seemed to be excelent. As time went on it became more difficult to buy newly published books from Amazon. Now when a new book comes out It is not available for Kindle or for some older books in a series #1,2 and 4 are available but not 3. When you go to Barnes and Noble all the books are available for the Nook. I am ready to put the Kindle aside, purchase and Ibook and use the apps to have the best of both worlds.Amazon seems to be playing games with the publishers as the hard cover books are now ten dollars.I got the Kindle, not to save money but to have my books in a portable format.I wouldn't recommend the Kindle to anyone until Amazon stops playing games with it's customes, stops blaming the publishers (B&N; doesn't seem to be having trouble) and makes books available for purchase."
3,"Poor TTV, instructions aren't so user friendly","When I make my research on the eBook Readers I wanted it to be light, user friendly and wanted it to have the Text to Voice (TTV) tool. Since the Ipad didn't has the TTV I decided for the kindle.The TTV tool work great in English... but it didn't work for other languages. I thought that I can bay a tool so make it work in Spanish but there isn't any tool the help with the TTV in Spanish.The instructions aren't so use friendly. Every time that I down load something from my computer I have to pay for it. I have tried to use the USB and the free email but this didn't work. I follow the instructions but until now I can't complete the transfer from my computer to the Kindle."
2,DISAPPOINTED,"I BOUGHT THE KINDLE ABOUT ONE MONTH AGO AND AT THE SAME TIME PURCHASED ""WASHINGTON CROSSING"" BY FISHER. AT FIRST I WAS VERY PLEASED WITH MY KINDLE BUT WHEN I DISCOVERED I COULD NOT ACCESS THE VOLUMINOUS FOOTNOTES IN THE BOOK I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED. YOUR TECH STAFF WHILE VERY COURTEOUS AND KNOWLEDGEABLE WERE UNABLE TO HELP ME CLAIMING THE FAULT WAS DUE TO THE PUBLISHER OF THE BOOK NOT PROVIDINGANY EASY WAY TO OPEN THE FOOTNOTES??NOW I SEE THAT I WILL PROBABLY HAVE TO PAY CONSIDERABLY MORE THAN THE $9.99 PRICE I EXPECTED TO PAY WHEN I BOUGHT THE KINDLE. AGAIN, I READ IT IS BECAUSE OF THE PUBLISHERS??? I HAVE NEVER KNOWN OF A BUSINESS DECIDING THE BEST WAY TO BEAT THE COMPETITION IS TO MAKE THE CUSTOMER PAY MORE FOR THE PRODUCTS YOU ARE TRYING TO SELL THEM. SOUNDS AS SCREWY AS OBAMA'S HEALTHCARE PLAN AND HIS ""STIMULUS"" SPENDING. BUT THEN AGAIN MAYBE BEING ONLY 80 YEARS OLD I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH EXPERIENCE.JOSEPH MCINTYRENAPLES, FL"
5,"If You Like to Read, Then The Kindle is for You","If you like to read and don't like carrying books, magazines and other reading materials in your handbag, briefcase, tote bag, then the Kindle is for you. No more shoulder pain for me after a day of travel...all of my reading materials can now fit into my 6"", 3 oz (with leather cover) Kindle. I love the portability of it! With the leather cover, available for purchase at an additional cost, The Kindle (6"") is no bigger than a small note pad! I also love the fact that I can easily download books from anywhere and at anytime. No more writing books down on a list at home, trekking to the bookstore or library, only to find out that it is out of stock or there is a waiting list. The device has performed wonderfully in the one month that I have had it. If you like to read, then The Kindle is for you."
1,Downloading Reception,"Make sure you have dowloading reception in the area where you live. Otherwise, you have wasted your money on a Kindle 2, which is useless. Where I live. there is no reception. Check the global coverage map prior to purchasing, and save yourself too many problems."
2,Kindle Wireless Reading,Pros: Easy to download BooksLimited Internet AccessCons: Overprice way overpriced for what you getBlack and White DisplayNo Back LightCan purchase other compatible items with more features and better quality for the same money.
5,Amazing device on Amazon!,"I've had my Kindle now about two months and absolutely love it! I recently went on a trip and took my Kindle with me. I had at my disposal various books I had purchased (downloaded in my Kindle) a dictionary and if I wanted to, could have gone into the Web. All, in this 6"" easy to carry device. I read from it on the airplane and the lady sitting next to me asked me what it was, so I went into my ""Spiel"" telling her how convenient this was. No longer having to carry heavy books while traveling. Also, that she could purchase thousands of books and download them as well as the fact that some of the books are free and most of the others cost less than $10 each. I think she will be your next customer. It's wonderful to be able to find out immediately what a word means without having to go find a dictionary. And to be able to make the fonts as big or little as one wants.So many fantastic features!"
3,Good Idea - but too much control,"The Kindle is a good idea with a bad implementation, and sadly I would rather buy a product without DRM - today Amazon automatically deleted Orwell's Animal Farm and 1984 from Kindles without the user's permission because the publisher decided retroactively not to publish e-books of these works. Amazon gave a refund for these books - but this displays a frightening control over your library - the equivalent of Barnes and Noble sneaking into your house and steaking your library."
5,LOVE IT...LOVE IT!!!!,"I just love my Kindle. It does everything I except it to do. It's easy to hold in my hands and I am not going to purchase a cover because it will semms like a book and I do not want that. It also good on my eyes. My eyes start to tear up after an hour of reading, yesterday I read for 4 hours and my eyes was not tired at all. If I didn't have to go to work the next day I would have read throughout the night. I love this purchase and I highly recommend it."
5,I'm enjoy reading again!,"This product is really amazing. I love to read but I do not have the space to store books and I simply hate to ""Throw a book away"". I love to reread books and chapters. The Kindle made it so I actual enjoy reading again.The kindle is not perfect (sorry Amazon) but close. Navigation is clumsy but you'll get the hang of it rather quickly. I love not being tethered to a PC to download and install books."
2,The screen is too dark for my eyes,"I received Kindle as a gift, and was very excited because Kindle would ""de-clutter"" my travel bag and book shelves. Indeed, the technical capabilities of this device are amazing, but I did not have a chance to enjoy them. The screen is TOO dark for my eyes. My eyes get tired after 15 minutes of reading."
2,Does NOT deliver the features advertised !!!!!,"The K2 does NOT deliver the features advertised.1) The battery does NOT stay charged for four days with WhisperNet on. Mine lost 80% of power in just 14 hours AND I had WhisperNet OFF for most of that time. Given this fact, I cannot imagine that the battery charge lasts for ""weeks"" without WhisperNet on, as the ad says it does.2) The TTS feature (text-to-speech) is a crap shoot. Which books will be able to access this feature and which will not is now up in the air because Amazon acquiesced to the Author's Guild. Amazon sold this product by saying that ALL text could be converted to speech.3) The battery is not replaceable with K2, unlike K1.4) No SD in the K2.If I had a K1, I'd keep using it!(And that, my friends, is what Amazon gets for sending me a product that does NOT perform as advertised!)"
5,Really nice!,"I bought the Kindle for my wife, who is an avid reader. She absolutely loves it! It's easy to read and super convenient for her as she is disabled. Highly recommended."
4,Amazon Kindle,"I love my new Kindle. The one thing I was not aware of is, it has no back light to read at night. This was very disappointing.I bought a clip on light but it makes a glare on the screen. With all the technology out there how come you did not install a backlight?"
4,Sharing Content,"I don't yet own a Kindle. I have asked ""Santa"" for one for Christmas. So this is not a review, but a question. One of the great things about buying books is sharing them with your friends. It doesn't seem like Amazon, with Kindle, has addressed this. If I buy a book, I own it. Should I not be able to loan it (or give it) to a friend? I rarely read the same book twice, but if I get really good one, I like to ""pass it forward"". Can I do this with Kindle? Anyone else have thoughts on this?"
2,Kindle review,"I am a user from Germany. They are a lot of problems with the connections. Sometime for days.To not be bale to receive pictures, it makes reading a news paper a little be difficult.I will not buy a second one or recommend it for my friends in Europe. I ma sure in one year from now, we will se a better technology on the market. You can only buy english books. This is a limitation in Europe."
3,"Kindle is good, but.....","Really liked the Kindle when I first got it. It's nice to be able to download books via 3G network. However, I've come to realize that not all books are available to Canadians. Especially new realeases from popular authors like Stephen King and Steve Berry. Had I known that I probably would never have bought the Kindle. What's the sense in having it if I still have to buy new releases and popular authors on hardcover. Really disappointed with that and may return it if I can."
2,Love books too much?,"The Kindle is great. That's a good start. But, after using it for a couple of weeks, I found that I loved my old books much too much. Perhaps its my age (too old). Perhaps I just love the color illustrations when found in books. Maybe its the smell (yes, many books aquire a comforting scent - at least comforting to some), or falling asleep with a Kindle on my chest in my easy chair just wasn't the same (actually, I was worred too much about it crashing to the floor to fall asleep). Perhaps there will come a day when an electronic device (like the Kindle) will have the look and feel of a real book displaying two pages, impervious to coffee mug rings on the screen and never needing to be plugged in. All that said, I've seen the future, and the future is the Kindle - or something similar. I accept that. The printed book has had a good 500+ year run, and it had time to get a lot of things right. I just think I'll stick with the past during the little time I have left."
3,Kindle Mentone,"All is good for today's users, but I will see WiFi connection to Internet, decent browser and pictures.One think what I would like to tell you is current arrangment for Australian users where we are unable to brows Google on Kindle due to provider restrictions.Some books are overpriced, lack of access to more magazines."
4,Kindle 2 review,"Good. It'll be even better to support viewing doc, xls and ppt natively.The experimental features are useful. MP3 player can be further improved by reducing occasional noices and including selection of tracks to play."
5,Great idea,This turned out to be the best idea in awhile for my wife and I as both of us were really filling up our bookshelves. Easy to use and easy to buy new books.
1,deleted books after purchased.,"Late last week, Amazon deleted purchased copies of George Orwell's 1984 and Animal Farm from the e-book readers of hundreds of users. This is very bad."
5,a good kindle,"I recently purchased the Kindle and was initially impressed about its concept. On receiving the Kindle I was amazed at how versitile reading with the Kindle is, its compactness allows me comfortable reading along with the slimmness of the unit I now don't have carry it like a book seperate from my work case as now it slips quite snuggly into on of my case sleeves. I am all for praising the Kindle the only downturn is the availability of current books as what is available is often twelve months old publications and the cost can to download book can be dearer than buying at discount book shops. I will continue to use my Kindle,and as a suggestion is it possible to put down the bottom the number of pages read and the number of pages to be read. Thank you, arthur"
5,Love it so much!,"I'm not a technical person so read someone else's review for all that jazz. I just love downloading a book in seconds and having the ability to sample a few pages before my purchase. Also, it has the practical plus of cancelling an accidental purchase -- which I had to use. I've just finished reading my first book. I enjoyed turning pages from either side of the device and hitting previous page to look back. The screen is very like a sheet of paper and easy on the eyes. Since I use 2.0 reading glasses, I appreciated the feature of enlarging the text. I loved the way I could just close my cover and the book would hold my place. Each time I opened the cover again, a sketch of a famous author was displayed on the screen -- very nice touch. I'm very happy with the purchase. I ordered the black Kindle 2 cover and am also very pleased with the feel of it."
5,Convenient without being complicated,"The kindle is great! Very easy to use, light, and ideal for anyone looking to maximize their book collection without breaking their back. Also has great internet features."
3,Failed to mentioned!!!! Buyer Beware,"The Kindle 2 seems great and seems like a great travel companion. But the people at Amazon Kindle failed to mention that a US based credit card is required to purchase any of the Kindle Books. And at this time customer service is unable to authorize any foriegn credit card transactions. Makes it a bit tricky to enjoy such a great product. Further more the whispernet is not supported abroad, which requires you to have your laptop or PC with you while traveling to deliver kindle books. It's a shame that there was no mention of the need for a US based credit card or that the extra features are not available in foriegn countries. Seems to me that the Kindle is best suited for those that travel but in actuality it's not capable of providing said services unless you are within the US."
2,cheaper to just buy a book,"I hate to say this, but looking at the prices charged for books on Kindle it strikes me that I can buy an awful lot of real books for the price charged for the machine---and looking at the exhorbitant prices for books to be downloaded to a kindle, I suggest rather stronly that someone is getting away with highway robbery!! There is no reason, other than what the market will bear, for a downloaded book to be ten dollars or more. I get most of my books for far less than that thru Edward R. Hamilton and the local library sales or the used book stores in town. I rarely buy a book costing ten bucks or more. I can see the convenience of a Kindle, but I think I will wait until the price for both the machine and the books comes down drastically. Novel idea. Bad pricing."
3,Two Kindles DEAD !,"My wife and I each have a kindle. Hers is the original model, mine is the Kindle II. To our surprise, both of our kindles died. Hers barely within the one year warranty period and mine just beyond the warranty. Hers was replaced and the replacement has been working fine for approximately 10 months. I'm in the process of communicated with Amazon to determine if mine can be fixed. We love the features of our Kindles - but how disheartening it is to see both of them die so soon. They were well taken care of and not subjected to any harsh useage. Neither of the kindles was dropped.So, fine devices we really like a lot, but poor reliability.Time to get an iPad?"
2,Please DO OPEN THE KINDLE TO OTHER FORMATS !!!!!,"Being a new kindle user and e-reader , I tend to read extensively; I am taking to it.Living in a country with another language, though, it absolutely buggers me that Kindle won't admit other sellers/formats.I do and did buy a lot from Amazon, but it is absolutely crazy and rather shortsighted to block reading other e-books.Wouldn't it be possible that the Kindle could become more popular in Europe ( and probably the US , as well) if it were able to cross-read more books, both ways round ??!!!Next time I buy an e-reader,I will probably first try whether the amazonbooks will still be readable and then prabably buy a more multifunctional e-reader.This is absolutely ****."
3,Not enough titles in Australia,"The Kindle device itself is fantastic, however there are not enough Kindle books available to purchase through Amazon. I have searched for many best selling books only to find they are not available in Australia which is dissapointing."
3,can't change text size,"My husband purchased kindle for me, but I have other Ebooks saved on my computer, I downloaded them onto my kindle but the text is really tiny & I can't change the size. can I even change it, if so how?"
4,Love my Kindle,"I had trouble at first figuring out how to use the Kindle, but after taking the time to read the user's manual that came with it I am now really enjoying it. The only problem I have encountered is that it sometimes opens to a place that I had read previously and then I have to forward pages until I reach the page I left off at. It also doesn't page forward sometimes so I need to press the next page button again (but that is a small issue). I also love that I now can get the Kindle on my laptop and sync it with my Kindle - awesome."
2,Kindle Repair Depot?,"I cannot find a repair depot(for an out of warranty first generation Kindle)repair anywhere on the Amazon site. These devices evidently don't have a very long useful life-cycle if Kindle assumes you'll be replacing rather than repairing them every couple of years.Roy KingEnglewood, FL"
5,LOVE THE KINDLE,"I enjoy the kindle, i thought i wouldn't enjoy it because it wasn't holding a book but i absouletly love it"
5,Best Birthday Present Ever,"My husband got me the Kindle for my birthday. I am an avid book reader, and so far I can't put my Kindle down. I like being able to upload a new book no matter where I am. I've always got a few books on my Kindle that I haven't read yet, so I never run out. It is easy to use, and the smaller one is the perfect size for my purse. If you get one, be sure to get a protective cover. You really don't want to leave it out for fear the screen will get scratched, or someone will knock it off a shelf.Everytime I pull out my Kindle, someone comes up to me and asked about it. They've either seen it on Oprah, or heard about it online. I always show them how easy it is to work. The first time I used it, I actually forgot it was an ereader, and tried to turn the page as I got more and more engrossed in the book."
5,I Love my Kindle,"Why Buy the New Kindle 2?Kindle: Amazon's 6"" Wireless Reading Device (Latest Generation)"
3,Cool Kindle,"I love my Kindle. It is easy on the eyes, light and responsive.The downsides: no magazine subscriptions that I want (yet) and a lot of the books available are for the USA market but this is the future.Consider buying one if you read a lot and don't like to carry heavy books.I also bought a very swanky purple cover which is most coveted by everyone at work.AMAZON get more title on it and it will be perfect."
4,Excellent reading aid.,"Purchase of my kindle has truly enhanced my reading experience. The perfectly flat page eases focusing, especially when one's eyes are tired late at night and the variable font size is also helpful in this regard.I appreciate the convenience of being being able to download a new book literally at a moment's notice. In this regard I wish more books were available in the kindle format and that kindle could access other formats.A software feature I would appreciate would be the inclusion of a digital clock somewhere on the screen.To sum up, I am really pleased that a purchased my kindle."
1,Books you buy are not yours,"Imagine you purchased a book through this device, imagine that you are 10 pages from the end. Now imagine someone comes along and rips that book out of your hand. That is what has happened when Amazon removed 2 books from it's library. The books disappear, this has a chilling effect. Once Amazon is pressured to remove books by the publisher, the government? they cave.Very Disappointing, it makes the device unusable and unrealibilty."
2,"At this price, the 2 & DX should be a no-buy for everyone","Boy did I really want a Kindle 2 or DX (preferred), but not at the DX price nor the Kindle 2 price with samller screen. I looked at (and acutally operated) bothe the Kindle 2 and DX. Amazon needs to lower th e price for both quickly. I ended getting an iPad. Didn't really want to buy an iPad, but when I look at what you get, it just made economic sense. I now have every eBook format and reader on my iPad and more.I am not an Apple nut, but I am a sensible shopper. I would still look to get a DX because I do like the eInk display on the 9.7"" screen. You really need to drop it below $350.00 for me to think about it and if you drop it undeer $300.00 I will buy it tomorrow."
4,Range of books not there yet,"The Kindle device itself is difficult to fault, it's somewhat bigger than a Sony Reader Pocket, but still small and very portable.The weakness of the device is in the books, for my own tastes in books, the range is weaker than the Sony Reader, but this can probably be worked on.Unless the downloading books over the mobile network is important to you, then the Sony Reader will save you about 100, be smaller and offers pretty much the same thing."
3,Warning to Canadians.,"The number of books available in Kindle format is severely limited in Canada. Although the Amazon literature says, ""Content availability and pricing vary for customers outside of the U.S."", that doesn't begin to constitute enough of a warning about how many books that are available to Americans are not available in Canada.Even, books by Canadian writers like Louise Penny and Alice Munro cannot be downloaded in Canada.Consequently, I find my kindle to be useful for downloading a few of the books I'd like and having them in a convenient, lightweight format. But my hopes of buying most of my new books on Kindle are not possible in Canada. Book after book that I wanted to download turns out to be unavailable here although it is available in kindle format.So if you are thinking of buying a kindle, be aware that the exciting promises made by the Amazon.com ads and video, mainly do not apply to Canadians at this time."
2,Not accessible to visually impared,"K2 has the best text to speech voice(s) that I have heard. I am visually impaired and have a computer with a screen reader, which absolutely butchers American language. K2 offers a wide array of book of current issues. Although the Library of Congress books are wonderful sometimes it takes 5 years to get them, and of course they can't record everything.Here's my K2 rub: Although the e-speech is wonderful, the controls and directions on how to order the books isn't read - it's not accessible. So I'm giving back K2 to my friend in the hope that in another year this situation will be remedied and I'll be a K2 user to. Just do what a screen reader now does and you have the whole market for the visually impaired in the palm of your hand. But watch out for the NSA/CIA - they'll have to take you away.Yours truly,Patricia V. Ward LCSW, BCDClinical Therapist and Supervisor"
4,Kindle Anchorage Alaska 2009,"02/28/2009 Just got my Kindle, since I can't use the wireless option, I used my laptop and a single book downloaded around one second. (4/29/09) update...Anchorage has 3G network and I can use it to downloads books at 60 sec."
5,kindle frequent user,"I bought my first kindle two months ago and I have already bought a second one for my husband. It is very useful and confortable for traveling, especially if you are a good reader or spend too much time between flights. The book collection has many recently published books as well as classics. I usually read two or three books at the same time and when I go away, the weight is always a problem and I have to choose only one to take with me. With Kindle, I can take all ma library with me, go back to old books and try new ones,all at the same time. This is the best product I ever got from amazon, by far."
2,Born Oct 2009- DIED Jan 2011,"I am a long time Amazon customer. After paying big bucks for the Kindle in 2009, I am disappointed. Just a few months after purchasing this item, Amazon decided to lower the price significantly. Then last month after having the device for just under 2 years, the pages are black and I can't read my books. I guess I should have bought the warranty but the reviews were so great that I decided against it. Needless to say, this purchase was a bust. BTW even if I had anted up for the extended warranty it would have only given me an extra year. Longevity on this device,... TERRIBLE!"
2,Superb Machine With One Fatal Flaw,"Yes, it is a wonderful device but the ""fly in the ointment"" is as follows:Screen contrast is TERRIBLE. I am constantly frustrated by its lack of contrast. Please Amazon.....give us a darker font or somehow improve the contrast!!!!!!!! Buyer beware on this issue!!!!"
1,"Amazon.com, aka Big Brother","The irony of Amazon's most current actions with the DRM laden Kindle is almost too much to bear. Imagine the joy you would have experienced this week to have discovered that Amazon had decided to delete the copy of ""1984"" that you _thought_ you owned.I was very interested in getting a Kindle until I read through their fine print and realized that I would only be borrowing any book I wanted to read on the device and that Amazon could (and has) remove any content it pleases at any time.At least with a real book, no-one can reach into my house and take it away from me remotely.And if Amazon will do it for a publisher, what's to stop them from removing content for a government or powerful business interest?Think about it..."
1,This device is defective by design!,"When you buy a Kindle, Amazon controls it, not you. They can enter into your Kindle and delete your books at any time- and DO! They recently deleted George Orwell's 1984 and Animal Farm from every customers Kindle.iRexTechnologies produces a few different DRM-free e-book readers that are much much better. Twice the price-but well worth it if you want to get through reading your book before it is stolen from you by the same company who sold it to you."
5,Un-believable,After comparing the Kindle with the Barnes and Nobel Nook I found that the Kindel is a far better product. After purchasing the Kindel and using it I am totaling convinced the Kindel is a fantastic product easy to use and navigate through. I just Love it. I would recommend it to anyone. The different sized fonts are great easy on the eyes. Ordering new reading matter and down loading it is a matter of seconds. Navigating through a book is easy and using the dictionary is to look up a word is so simple. The Kindel makes reading a pleasure.
1,Books bought and deleted later,I certainly wouldn' buy such a device that would allow the vendor to remove my own books I bought and paid. Just because the publisher decided to take it back.
2,Battery Life,"I had a patient tell me about the Kindle and I bought it about three months ago. My only complaint is that the battery life is very bad. I have to constantly charge the battery. I like to go Canada backpacking and I can't take the Kindle with me for any length of time, it's very frustraing.Thanks for letting me comment. DS"
5,My new Kindle,"Wow, what can I say. This thing is terrific. Easy to read, it remembers where you stopped reading so the next time you pick it up you don't have to search for your page. Haven't used the page marker feature. Easy to download books. My husband recently had a total knee replacement and I took the Kindle with me to read in the waiting room - it would have worked great except that everyone one wanted to see how it worked and I didn't get much reading done.I was absolutely amazed by how quickly you can download a new book. I love it."
4,I love my Kindle!,"It took me a long time to decide to buy one. I was not sure I would like it, because I love reading, I love the contact of paper, the smell, the weight of a book. But I love my Kindle! It is really practical when I travel, it is so easy to download books that I am reading more than ever... and I still love real books. I am looking forward to have the possibility to download books in other languages: French, Spanish For the moment, you can ony get some classics."
2,"Not good with tables, graphics and pictures","I did return it because I was unable to clearly read graphics, tables and pictures.It is a great device for reading literature books. Not so good when reading books with numbers, diagrams, tables or detailed pictures.May be the newest versions will solve this issue."
4,Kindle 2,"I've been using my new Kindle 2 for a couple weeks. It's great! Love the weight, nice and light. The size, is perfect. The capability to change the font is great. I've always hated when I'd buy a book and it was smaller than normal font...Really didn't think I would like reading from the device, but I do.I bought it at the time the Nook from Barnes and Nobles was coming out. So I looked at what that device had verses the Kindle. The only thing that I liked on the nook was no charge for sending emails to the device with documents. With the Kindle, there is a charge. However, files can be copied to the Kindle via the USB cable with no charge. Since I'm not planning on using for a document reading, I didn't see this as a big deal. But if you plan to send documents to it and want to do it easily by just emailing, you may want to look at the Nook."
1,Because the Kindle people did it to us,"Buy a book. Thousands of years of tradition, people. Also, because so many people are rating new release books as one star because they aren't releasing a Kindle version of the book with the hardcover. Come on, people. Paperback fans have to wait for what they want. You made the choice to buy the Kindle, deal with it."
2,"After only 15 monthsk, 5 way controller button split","After only 15 months of use, the plastic five-way-controller button split diagonally. The best the service people could do is suggest that I try gluing it back together. Or they offered to sell me another Kindle at a reduced price. I chose not to do that (""Once burned, twice shy!""). I have enjoyed the Kindle for fifteen months and bought about one hundred books in that time, but even if I can use the glue method for a while, in the future I plan to buy an I-Pad where I can get books from many sources and cease buying books from Amazon. And even now, I'll probably cut way back on buying books (and other items) from Amazon. The machine should have functioned without falling apart longer than fifteen months. They have no service policy on the Kindle."
2,Kindle: Great electronics. not enough books,"I loved the look and feel of the Kindle. But of the 8-10 books I wanted to buy or preview, only one was available for the Kindle. I also tried downloading a PDF document onto the Kindle but could not adjust the font size, making it unreadable on the device.I returned my Kindle for credit. Too bad."
3,Beware of price differences in books if you are International!,"Kindle is a great product, but buyer beware! If you get a Kindle and live outside the United States, the books, magazines and newspapers that you buy can come with a higher price!As an example, the bookToe PopperJohnny Tangerine is only .99 cents for customers in the United States. It rises to $2.99 for those of us in Canada. A subscription to theThe Washington Postnewspaper is only $11.99 in the US, but it is more than $23.00 in Canada.I can see a small premium being added for things, but prices that are double or triple seem a bit out of line.Just thought you might like to know."
5,Having serious bonding time with my kindle,"I LOVE IT!! I have been holding out on buying an e-book for years as a die-hard ""paper-feel"" book-lover. But, I moved to Germany for a few months and there was no way my book habit could keep up with English books (and euro prices) so I finally bought the Kindle. I've had it for a few days and I can't imagine why I didn't buy one before. As I will be using this primarily in Germany, I download to my computer which is cheaper - although in a book emergency the download price doesn't seem to bad. The screen is not ultra-bright which is great on my eyes and the font size and type is perfect. I do wish is that the screen was a little bigger and that the keyboard didn't occupy so much space. The only problem I'm having is trying to limit the number of books I buy!!"
5,Amazon Kindle,"I ordered this product literally two days before Christmas because I changed my mind last minute and decided to get it as a gift for my Mom. It was the ""hottest"" item of the season and not only were they not sold out but it shipped to my house the NEXT day! Of course I had to pay extra for overnight shipping but I was still impressed it arrived so quickly and in time for Christmas."

5,"Kindle with 6"" Display","I'm an avid reader and have always carried books around with me wherever I go. I am so thrilled with the Kindle. It fits conveniently in my purse, is easy to use, and enables me to carry more than one book with me at a time. I had put off purchasing one as I wasn't sure how I would like it. Wish I'd bought one much sooner."
4,"the Kindle in Ontario, Can.","My wife and I find this a dandy product. Mostly we use it now to read the daily paper. Not only do we save C$25.00 per month on that, but its convenience is just amazing. It ""arrives"" before breakfast and can be read easily anywhere in the house, even in bed. The very easy to employ dictionary is excellent. We do miss the crossword puzzle somewhat, but now handle that by having obtained a handy book of puzzles. It lacks many pictures, which is a negative aspect, and does not have stock quotes, which we had not followed much anyhow. We will purchase some ""books"" after we complete the unread ones lying around. The Kindle ones seem amazingly inexpensive, the ones we have easily checked out. WE heartily recommend this product."
2,KINDLE IN AUSTRALIA -- THINK TWICE,"Although I love the idea of the Kindle, outside of the USA it is not so useful. The book selection available from Australia is minimal at best. I received the Kindle as a present but now that I discovered the extreme limitations of choices available in Australia I would definitely not recommend it. I am almost in awe that Amazon advertises the kindle for australians when every book I search out says 'This is not downloadable in Australia'."
5,Kindle purchase,"I am really, really pleased with the Kindle. I have been waiting since 2008 for it to be available in the UK. It is exactly what I wanted in an ebook reader. I buy most of my books from Amazon anyway, so it made sense to be able to access and buy through my ebook reader, and now I can purchase from my computer as well from the Kindle itself because I have just downloaded Kindle online.I really enjoy using my Kindle - you don't have the bother of pinning pages open when reading at the table and to have a whole library at my disposal in one slim electronic device is fantastic! I can't recommend it too highly - I am most impressed!"
4,Love it!,"What can I say that hasn't been said in the other thousand great reviews of this product? I've always been an avid reader, but my Kindle has allowed me to read even more. It's in my purse at all times, so I can read my book whenever I have a few minutes to spare. It just wasn't feasible to carry a big novel around with me wherever I went. Great product, no complaints.I did purchase a neoprene case and screen protector since I knew the best feature about the Kindle - to be with me at all times - would also expose it to harm."
4,The perfect replacement for books,"The kindle is by far the best replacement out there for books (as opposed to Computers and ipods). But I have one grave complaint, lack of Wifi. Now I Know that the 3g capability is supposed to cover the connectivity part of the equation. But the Amazon people, apparently, did not consider overseas travelers when they agreed with Sprint to provide the kindle with data connection. I know it is hard to talk to providers in all continents to secure a data service agreement. Therefore, the best way to ensure that everyone who has a kindle can log-in to amazon.com actually does, Amazon should add wifi capability to its next kindle. That's when I will give it 5 stars without thinking twice. As of now, the only way around this is to buy books using your computer and then transfer the data manually through USB to the kindle, which works for me--for now."
4,Bait & Switch?,"I bought the original Kindle about a year ago and have loved it. The convenience and ease of use are a quantum leap ahead of the bygone days of hardcover books. However: I have noticed a dramatic increase in the price of many books offered for download to my Kindle. One of the reasons I bought mine a year ago was the ""nothing costs more than $9.99"" feature. That feature has certainly gone away. I'm now seeing many books priced in the $13 - $15 range, a big difference from $9.99. At these new prices, I'm starting to question the economics of owning a Kindle. For a few dollars more, maybe I should just buy a hardcover that I can pass along to friends or contribute to my local library."
3,European Use,I have really enjoyed my Kindle Two while traveling in Europe. I purchased a lot of guide and language books before I left the US. There ar two issues I found somewhat cumbersome. Newspaper delivery and purchasing additional books are not available while in Europe. There doesn't seem to be a network available to download periodicals and etc. The other issue is books that have tables. They are small and hard to read at times and the expand text feature doesn't expand text. Other than that I am enjoying the Kindle and glad that I downloaded my reading materials before I left the US. I recommend you do so too if traveling outside the US.
3,"Needs ""Tickertape"" option.","I haven't bought this and I'm not buying this unless they add a Tickertape option to it. Right now I can already get ebooks on other devices that cost less. But none have the ability to let me read the way I want to, with an optional variable speed Tickertape feature. It would be an easy application to build."
2,Disappointed.,"Three major issues right out of the box with this product.1) It feels cheap, like it's going to pop its seams every time you pick it up. This device is way to expensive for this build quality.2) USB access. Hooking this up to my Mac, it doesn't appear as a drive for several minutes, copying files is basically impossible as it responds so slowly I think my Mac had to revert to morse code to transfer the data.3) Image Ghosting / Persistence. Terrible. Terrible Terrible. Every page turn leaves the ghost of what came before. Menus and dialogs remain for at least the next page refresh. It's bad in center of the page, the borders of the page are terrible. If this were an etch-a-sketch it would definitely need a couple more shakes.This is an initial review of the product, I'll update it if/when the situation changes."
5,LOVE Kindle 2,"The only companies I am SURE will be around at the end of 2009 are Amazon, with the amazing Kindle 2, and UPS. I have had mine for over a month now and could not live without it. Congrats to all for the best tech device since the first home computer. I am old enough to have worked on IBM System 3's and data recorders...I am excited all over again!"
5,LOve It!!,I love reading on it: but I especially like that you can get the meaning of a word instantly and that it has a complete dictionary on it. The chance to check out a book with the first two or three chapters is great. This is not only good to see if you will like the book but also if you have read it before. I have always read alot and sometimes do not place the name of the book as one I have already read. Thanks for the Kindle!! Also love that you can order books in the middle of the night from Amazon!
3,No wireless connection for Argentina,"My residence is in Argentina and the kindle2 doesn't run the wireless connection because my country. Also I had the expectation that some of the major Argentine newspaper, like CLARIN or LANACION, can take & develop this new technology."
2,So Disappointed,"I received my Kindle 2 on Friday and on the following Tuesday it completely stopped working. During the 4 days that I had it, I thoroughly enjoyed using it. I had downloaded 4 books and completed 1 1/2 of them before it ""died."" It was very frustrating not to be able to finish reading the book that was 3/4 of the way through. The Kindle was in the cover; it was never dropped or exposed to extreme temperatures. This technology should be more reliable. I found the instructions simple to follow; finding and downloading books/magazines was quick and easy. Incredible that the quality of this device would be so poor. I'm very disappointed and wonder whether or not to risk getting another Kindle 2 -- I don't want to have to return another one. I hope to automatically receive credit/refund for the books I downloaded as well as for the Kindle and the cover."
4,Kindle in Australia,I love the Kindle. I bought one for my mum for her birthday and myself. the only problem is being in Australia means we don't have access to everything.
4,Kindle 2,"I would like to have it easier to go to previously read pages, chapters or stories (or even go forward to a unread section, page or story i.e. The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, etc."
4,black and white,Lightweight hence comfortable to carry around. Can pack lots of books without increasing the weight or size :)Free 3G is added bonusButtons/joystick could have been smoother (something like touch wheel of older ipods). Also miss the color and the gloss while reading magazines and graphic novels
5,Fantastic,"Great face. Great read. Great comfort and convenience. You can carry your library wherever you go. Sorry I waited as long as I did to get it. Only two comments not great: the buttons are somewhat small; and all books are not avaiable. Only one problem: you really can't loan or give away your Kindle for a friend to read that book you want them to read. I suppose you could purchse it for them but it isn't the same. All in all it's fantastic and I highly recommend it to any reader, avid or otherwise. I mean you can take your library, up to 1,500 books, with you using only the space of a very thin notebook. How nice is that!"
4,First Six Months w/Kindle,"I've been pretty happy with my Kindle so far. Navigation and other functions took time to learn. I use my Kindle for reading books and two daily newspapers. I especially like reading newspapers this way, both Int'l Herald Tribune and SF Chronicle. The size is convenient for me c/w printed newspapers, and I don't miss the ads and a few other sections. Text and B&W; photos are clear. The web browser is very slow and limited in what it can access.A few changes I'd like to see: 1) faster response to buttons like next page, home, toggle; 2) text-to-speech pauses between section breaks, paragraphs, etc; 3) Internet access comparable to smart phones like iPhone and Blackberry... the Kindle already has 3G connectivity.I wonder what reading devices will look like in 5 or 10 years?"
5,Love the Kindle,The kindle is GREAT. I was look at the kindle for school and when I travel so I would not have carry all my books around.The kindle is so easy to operate. I got it about two month ago.Before I purchased the kindle I read all about the only thing I did not find out about was after one veiw the sample and decide not to buy the book how do one get the same off the kindle? So I do all my hunting for books on the computer then if choose not to buy the book then it is not downloaded to my kindle. Overall I am enjoying the Kindle.
4,Love it so far,"First the things I really like about the Kindle 21. It is lighter and actually easier to read than many trade paperbacks.2. I love the e-ink! There is no eye strain when reading.3. I love the ability to change fontsize.4. The keyboard is actually easier to use that I thought.5. I like the controls and the fact that I can hold it and use it with either hand.Now, what I wish it had1. I would like the ability to organize my books into folders.2. I would like the ability to change my own battery. Having screws in the back for the battery cover should not cause too many problems.3. I would prefer to have an SD card so I can store music on my SD card and have different music available when I want to read.Overall, this is a wonderful device. I look forward to using it for years to come."
2,Poor software,"While the Kindle itself is nice the included software leaves much to be desired. The software doesn't do service to the good hardware design.I found when switching between books it losses your place. The bookmark feature is useless. If you download from your computer it will sometimes download it again and you end up with two copies on the kindle.There is no way to organize your books. If the kindle decides to download an updated copy of its own manual, it appears first in the list. You can't move books as you read them to a different directory. The menu concept is clumsy."
5,Great Device,I would strongly reccomend the Kindle2. Only change that was made to the Kindle2 in comparison to the Kindle1 that I would have liked them to keep is the SD expansion slot.
1,I just don't get it..,"Why would you buy a device that charges you more for a product than a paperback? There is no paper--it is electronic! So the cost to distribute the media is almost nothing, yet you pay close to hardcover prices for books.Anyone who does this is stupid, unless you purchased for the email capability."
1,WOW WOTTA BARGAIN,"A $360 widget that displays up to 16 shades of grey in one format- GIMME A DOZEN! Welcome to 1995- the gadget of the past. Let's see, my $300 net book has 2 GB of RAM, 120GB of room, a copy of Windows XP, runs Word, Acrobat and Excel, wireless internet and a long battery life. Why would I spend more on a toy?"
4,Very good!,"This product satisfied my expectations. It will become excellent when they will implement a touch screen. Unfortunately, there are only a few publications in Italian."
3,Great product but warranty is not what it seems.,"Hi,I loved my first Kindle reader and it served me well and hopefully I will continue to use Amazon products and purchase kindle literature, however, I thought there was something you should know about the warranty.I purchased a warranty just in case it malfunctioned. Sure enough, it did. Amazon quickly shipped me a new Kindle, and I was extremely happy with their service and attitude. However, since I returned my first new Kindle every Kindle since then has malfunctioned in a week or so, or even a day.(going on 4 now).The reason for this, I think, is because they send you back ""refurbished"" versions of the Kindle, which they obviously fail to thoroughly inspect, as the issues with my new Kindles have been simple...such as charging properly. I am at my wits end anybody out there in the same situation??"
5,He loves it!,"Purchased as gift for my husband as he loves to read and our bookshelves are overflowing. He hadn't requested an EBR, but I know he loves new electronics. He downloaded a book and quickly finished reading it. He really likes the abilities to annotate notes and change font size."
3,book availability,"i love my kindle ,however the nook from barns and noble would be a better choise as you are able to down load directly from your local library.I wish I had known that sooner."
1,"Kindle is exactly what I'm looking for, except...","Except that I can't buy one. I can rent it until Amazon decides to close my account but I can't own it or the works that are on it.If I buy some hardware, I expect it to run what I want it to run. The same applies to any data files from whatever source I choose to put on there. To tie it to a single source is an absolute deal-breaker. I'll make my own arrangements, thanks."
2,FAILED PRODUCT,I regret that the Kindle 2 is a great concept which is poorly executed. What is even more regrettable is that the major issues with this device have been well kn own to Amazon and could be cured by modification of the firmware. The first major issue is that there is no ability to control the contrast resulting in the inability to read tables and other similar type images which appear in many of the books which I read. The only thing that I can do is to transfer the book to my notebook computer and read it there which defeats the advertised benefit of the Kindle 2. The second issue deals with its implementation of pdf files. Ebooks in pdf format are unreadable because you cannot enlarge the text as well as adjust the contrast. I have yet to find any Ebook in pdf format does not produce microscopic text which cannot be enlarged. Amazon support is useless. It simply tells you that it will report the problems.I anticipate that I will go to another reader ASAP.
2,Amazon non responsive when my Kindle broke,"I enjoyed my Kindle (first generation) until I dropped it about 14 inches, ruining it. I was surprised that such a small fall could hurt the Kindle, but I was absolutely stunned at the shoddy and unresponsive customer service I received from Amazon. As much as I would like another Kindle, I would not buy another from Amazon.Kindle: Amazon's 6"" Wireless Reading Device (Latest Generation)"
3,Author/Engineer,"I bought the first Kindle for $369I loved it to the tune of over a 160 titles that I had read.I dropped it and it broke.It was going to cost me $99 to have it repaired.So, I bought the new model for $189 (I may still have the old one repaired)The main complaint I have with the new one is if you accidentally touch a a character on the keyboard, it shows up at the bottom and to turn the page you have to click ""next page"" twice.I miss the content manager and the only feature I like about the new one is the ability to waken the thing.BTW, fortunately I now have my Amazon content on my computer, but I haven't figured how to find it on the new Kindle"
5,In love,Absolutely in love! User friendly...easy is an understatement. If you have been pondering the idea of purchasing the kindle for yourself or as a gift for some lucky unsuspecting person.... ponder no longer. Perfect for people who love gadgets and/or love to read. It is just perfect... Love it!! This is my favorite purchase of the year!! Did I use the word love to many times? I do not think so. I LOVE IT.
5,everyone needs one,Best gift idea known to man.Give these out and be a hero. - Serious. People love these.
5,Kindle Delight,"Purchased for my wife for Christmas. I can't tell you how delighted she is with it. The ""read to"" feature is a huge plus and she uses it all the time when working around the house. Great with or without headphones. She also likes it for travel to reduce bulk on the airplane. Downloading books is a cinch."
4,Kindle review,"I really love my Kindle! I debated long and hard, doing alot of research on it prior to my purchase. It is everything I thought it would be...After you get into a good story, it is true, you really don't notice you are reading on a device instead of the book. It is easy on the eyes, easy to hold and I love the dictionary feature that is so easy to use. The only problem I have had with my Kindle, is that on the first charge, it apparently wasn't fully charged, I lost everything about 48 hours later. Of course I freaked out, having spent all this money on the Kindle. The people at the Kindle customer support line were very helpful, patiently giving me helpful information and guidance, we re-charged, reset and everything was back! I learned to turn off the wireless when not using. It makes your charge last so much longer! I love my Kindle!!"
2,"Nice, but......","HiI ordered the Kindle and it was delivered within days, the store connection and the usability are nice, the design on the other hand is a little bit dated.Display speed and quality very good in contrast to an Sony 505But, I returened it because of its unuseability with pdf, and that should be something a e-book should handle.Even the DX is said to have no zoom for pdf's and I want to read my papers on an ebookSorry Amazon but change your policy quickly or the others (iPad even unuseable at the moment) will blow you away"
4,"I LOVE THE KINDLE WITH ONLY ONE ""BUT"" FOR THE TIME BEING","After only 2 weeks as a user, I can say I love the kindle. I do not think the contrast criticisms that I read are a problem (I have been reading even at the beach and the definition of the screen is excelent). I miss though the ability to organize my own books in the device, according for example to types of novels (historical, mistery, comedy etc). I love the ease to download books, many of them free of charge, and not only classics, many are brand new by I guess novel writers who want to promote themselves. I also love the ease to see the latest best sellers and the opinions of other readers and magazines straight from the kindle device."
4,amazon,Amazon Kindle sucks ! This only happens in the US. I think removing a book after you paid for it is illegal.
5,CD Coral Springs,"OMG. All I can say is this device is fantastic. I never treat myself but this purchase was worth every dollar. No more lugging books all over town. I find this so convienent to use. Fits in my purse and I always have it with me. So easy to read, purchase new books with the touch of a button. Love the way it always opens to where I stopped reading. My husband has downloaded a couple of books he is interested in. Don't like the sharing part. Looks like a ""B"" Day present coming up."
4,"Wait a year or two, stick with the paper book for now.","The Kindle is a good product with a great idea. The only problem is that technology is moving so fast that waiting might be the best thing to do. I say don't rush and buy one, wait a year or two, it's probably what I should have done. Those old paper books on your shelf will last a little longer, won't they?"
1,How can I get this one!!!,"I'm in Korea.Unfortunately you are not avaible to ship this Kindle Dx to KOrea republic of.pls tell me, do you have any plan changing your shipping code."
3,What's next???,"It just erks me that everything is going digital. I have a Kindle 2 so this review can be seen as ""legit"". Yeah, it good for traveling and convenient access to books but I just can't fathom not physically turning pages or turning back quickly just to check up on something. Its a great device, I just like the little things of reading actual books."
1,BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!,"I received my Kindle 2 today. I have already mailed it back for a REFUND! I found the contrast MUCH too dark and the fonts FUZZY and MUCH too light! This display is not even remotely close to reading an actual book page! I am EXTREMELY unhappy with this device. I will buy a 6 inch Kindle after the following criteria are met. I simply want a WHITE background and CRISP, BLACK text. It is just that simple! WHITE BACKGROUND AND CRISP, BLACK TEXT! My God, we are in the 21st century folks. I am shocked that this device has received such stellar reviews. I find the display to be positively HORRID!"
4,why i didn't get a kindle,"After deciding to go with an ebook, I reviewed and reviewed available products until I was nearly blind. I kept leaning toward a Kindle but felt like a kindle 2 would suit my wants much better--THEN I looked at the price--OMG. I have read how much better the second version was and then not really satisfied with the first kindle due to the upgrades. I will probably go with the B&N nook simply because of the price. The non replacable battery does worry me--many said that they were not worried but I know that the rechargable batteries do go bad after a few years and I want this to be an investment for several years. Nook does do free upgrades to the system which pleased me as well..Sorry, kindle, you were my first choice but not my selection after research."
1,Kindle is Great Customer Loyalty/Support Terrible!!!!,"Price dropped last night $60...Customer Service at Amazon says they will refund difference if bought before June 8...I ordered mine on May 27...they basically said ""too bad"".There should at least be a prorated credit to purchase content for customers who bought this within last six months.I would have expected more from Amazon...I thought they were supposed to be more customer oriented...guess I found out differently...too bad since I really love the Kindle 2...(just hope I don't ever need a battery!"
1,Not as good as Kindle 1,"When I bought the Kindle 2 I was really excited. I loved my Kindle 1 and thought that the K2 would be even better. Boy, was I wrong. After using the K2 I am so ready to go back to the K1.All of my books need to be redownloaded which costs $0.15 to $0.30 per book. The books I bought from other ebooks sites, if I do not have them backed up on my computer are gone forever unless I want to rebuy them.THERE IS NO SD CARD. 1.5 GB is great, but it is nothing. I had a 4 GB SD Card in my K1.The USB Cord is not a normal USB. You need to buy a special size from Kindle in order to connect your K2 to the computer.If the battery dies you need to send your K2 back to Amazon to be fixed. How stupid is that. If you are like me you have withdrawls when you have nothing to read.I am not happy with the K2. Amazon really screwed up a great product."
2,not ready for prime time,"loved my kindle till it stopped working, it slipped off my knee from about 18 inches on a carpet, no scratchs, but machine would not open up, guess what for 200 you can buy a new one, i don""t think so, i would certainly not even carry it in a briefcase if it is that fragile. as much as i loved it the real value proposition is not good."
5,KINDLE ROCKS,"I finally treated myself to the Kindle and I am so glad I did. If you are an avid reader, or just want to download the daily paper to your Kindle-this is for you. It's easy to use-right from the box. I love the wireless feature, and the variety of books is great. There are even some free ones available for download.BUY IT!"
1,not a happy guy,"I feel like I was ripped off by amazon.I placed an order for the kindle on thurs at 10:30 pm,I then called my friend to bragg about it.He told me that there was a new kindle comming out around feb.I checked on the net and it does look like they will release a new one soon.So at 10:40 pm I went to my acc and wanted to stop the order,but for the 1st time since I have ordered from amazon i was not able to stop it.It said that the order was already to ship.I called amazon and was told that there was nothing they can do,told me when I get the package just to refuse it and I would get a refund.But not for the s/h.Like I said I have ordered from amazon many times and even when I picked next day delivery I still had about 3 or 4 hours to change or stop the order.I feel like Amazon is trying to get rid of the kindles that they have now to make room for the kindle 3 that is coming out soon.I am very shocked that amazon is doing this."
4,kindle review from OZ,I love the new kindle which I purchased over a month ago and when first available in Australia. Brilliant - however I am disappointed in the books available the lack of Australia British and even American authors is surprising. Come on Amazon more books for the kindle please.cheers Michelle
5,I'm reading again!,"I've read more books since I've gotten my Kindle 2 (about a month ago) then I have in the past three years. The Kindle 2 has made reading possible for me again as I no longer have to hold a book open. And I can carry several books, and magazines at once so I no longer have to overload my backpack or shoulder bag.Once again, reading is an enjoyable pastime for me."
4,First Impressions,"I just unpacked my Kindle 2, turned it around, and played with it a bit. First impressions:1) It feels lighter, and it much easier to hold than the Kindle 1.2) The next and previous page buttons are placed much better, and take more pressure to activate. So there should be a lot less ""accidental"" page turns.3) There's an option on the reading menu to sync to the furthest point read in the book. Excellent!4) Wireless is turned on and off from the menu, there's no physical switch.5) The Kindle 2 can be recharged with a USB cable. No more extra cable power.Those are all good things. BUT... there is one really annoying design feature. The USB cable is not a standard mini-USB (Mini-A) plug. I think it's a ""Micro-B"" plug, but I'm still trying to confirm that.That means I'll have to get some more cables, because I connect my Kindle to more than one machine. The Kindle 2 is still an excellent device, but I took a star off the review for the funky cable."
3,Love this gadget but what happened to editing?,"My husband & I bought the original Kindle that was shown on Oprah. We bought it for my mom who was recently hospitalized and could not turn the pages of a book but could handle hitting the next page button on the kindle. It gave freedom back to her so in that regard there are no complaints.Now that she has recovered we share the Kindle. In my experience, I have enjoyed using it with one big exception - editing errors. Some books are chocked full of editing errors such as Jeffrey Archer ""As the Crow Flies"". I was so distracted by these errors that I found it hard to finish the book. In fact, if the local library would have had this book on the shelf I would have gone to get it and ask Kindle for my money back. Not sure why the editing is a problem."
5,Kindle 2,I love my Kindle! It is the best thing I have ever purchased and I can't tell enough people about it. Actually my husband bought this for me along with the leather case and the 2 year warranty. I have called the tech help people twice because i didn't understand why on my second book it did not turn on to the last page read. I was turning it completly off each time and with the first book it would go to the last page read but since the secound book was formatted differently the Kindle would have to be put to sleep instead of turned off. It was my not understanding not a problem with the Kindle. I have it with me all the time and read allot in resturants and in the car.(my husband driving of course!)I can't say enough about it and I hope it is a big seller.
5,my favorite pastime,"I sold my Kindle 1 and purchased the Kindle 2. I purchased my K-1 using the coupon from Oprah. I think the K-2 is the absolute best device for reading and storing books. I had no problems transferring my books from the K-1 to the K-2. I did not really like the shape of the K-1and I did not care for the covers. The K-2 is easier for me to hold while I am reading and the buttons are more convenient.I am pleased that I purchased some of the books when I had my K-1, because these books are not free at this time. I am also very pleased with the $29.00 cover. I bought a mini computer zippered bag and a skin from Decalgirl, so it is well protected.I was showing it to my son and promised to buy one for him if he does well in school. We all love to read, and have no more room for books in our house. The cost was steep, but I feel it is well worth it. Who knows, Oprah may have another coupon for a discount in the future. I am very satisfied."
1,poor customer service,amazon shipped the kindle to my po box and sent it by ups. They refused to admit their error and refused to change the adddress so it was sent back to them. they lost the sale and a customer for over 10 yrs. smart mgt.
2,Was going to get but not now,"this might be removed but oh well.i was going to get a kindle 2 and a kindle dx one for me and one for my mom but after hearing about amazon erasing books off peoples kindles made me change my mind.it wasn't so much that they erased it but the fact they didn't tell people before hand and maybe make them a offer like. ""we will refund you the cost of the books and when we get the rights to them we will offer them to you free of charge"".you would think that amazon could had sent something to the kindle saying something like ""these books were put on are store and sold by mistake, we do no have the rights to them. we are sorry for the inconvenience"".but amazon came and erased the books like a thief in the night. i like amazon and i buy allot from them every month but they lost 2 kindle sales because of this maybe one day i might get one after i am sure they will not or can not do that again."
4,Why is there no light?,"I was very intrigued by the technology that would allow me to cut down on the clutter by my side of the bed. I have heard many users comment on the transition from turning pages manually to clicking to get to the next page and I have to say that has not been an issue for me. I get lost in the book just as much with the Kindle...AND I can switch easily from one book to another depending on what I feel like reading. But, where is the light? I was astounded to find there isn't one built in and I'd have to buy something that clips on to the device. You must be kidding me! The only other feature I think would be nice would be a clock so I could keep track of how much longer I had to read."
3,"Great screen, but poor interface","I sadly returned this product. I still have 2nd thoughts about my decision. I thought the screen display was excellent. It also looked really cool. My biggest gripe with the machine was its interface. The buttons to advance the pages were very stiff in my Kindle. Also the thumb stick was also very uncomfortable to use. In the day of the I Phone with its touch screen and the blackberry touch screen button keyboard, the Kindle felt crude. I will wait for next generation Kindle or the large screen I Pod touch or simply wait for the price to come down with this Kindle model."
2,Kindle missed the boat - Barnes & Noble Nook allows sharing!,"I was literally ""this close"" to buying a Kindle when I received notice TODAY from Barnes & Noble that they are releasing their own reader product, the Nook, that allows sharing of books not only between Nook owners, but to virtually any device that has the B&N; FREE downloadable reading software. My husband will likely not own a reader, but he WILL read books on one of his other devices that he carries with him all the time, so this feature alone has prompted me to consider the B&N; product over the Kindle. Not only that, but B&N; has access to MORE e-books and MORE FREE books!It's really too bad that Amazon didn't listen to its devoted customers on the sharing issue - this one is gonna hurt."
3,Limited Titles,"I purchased the Kindle for my wife's birthday and we have since returned it. We live in Canada and found there are many titles that are not available for the Kindle in this country. The books are listed at Amazon but could not be obtained here. Also there are a number of ""free"" items that we would have to pay for.We would also like to be able to share books as we do with printed books.Perhaps when we get the same or better selection than is available in the USA we might consider purchasing the Kindle again.On the plus side we found the Kindle easy to use with many great features."
4,The best reading device ever!,"Kindle is the best!!! Its fast, fun and everything I expected. The only thing I wish it had is a built in light. Other than that it's great. I would encourage anyone that reads a lot to get one."
4,Kindle 2,It is worth it.When using the built in joy stick when at the bottom of the menu page it will not go furner down. You have to use the page button to go to the next page then scroll down with the joy stick. Small but disrupts the flow of the menu.
4,Finally something that can replace a paper based book,"I have moved to IP on everything else, but have stuck to paper based books as the form factor of a screen just did not do it for me. The Kindle is the first gadget that can replace a book and in such a way that I will actually buy and read more books.Specifically great for buying a whole series, as you can buy them one after the other, in the correct order.It is even better in the wireless format, buying books and sending documents to it is a breeze, but a bit costly if you are based outside the US. Using USB is free, not that slick.The 6"" screen is a bit small (an international DX will be perfect) making me page over a bit more often than I like to.The file management interface is not as intuitive as it could be and two simple folders called ""On the kindle"" and ""Stored at Amazon"" could make life much simpler.Amazon also has to get more book titles available for purchase outside the USA.Best gadget I have bought in a while."
4,fantastic!,"I've had my Kindle for 5 months now and I can say I love the endless choices you get. If you are an avid reader, go on and get it, it will bring delight and fast service to you. To be brief, the pros and cons summarized are:Pros:Instant gratification! Get your e-book in less than 1 minute.Play with letter sizes, if you are like me and have a failing vision, this is a BIG plus.Get dictionary, use text to speech when you are driving (if enabled, create wish list, make notes, mark sections).Cons:It is still black and white! No color Book covers.Screen savers are the same always,When browsing titles most of the time the rating is based on kindle ranking and not on real statistics from book salers in generalBut overall, I love it....I don't even miss the ink and paper smell so much now."
1,Headache!,"A Xmas story:Purchased the Kindle as a Xmas gift for my Dad.Showed up Defective.Initiated exchange over a week ago.Sent broken Kindle back immediately, but still haven't received replacement.As the moment 9:56am Monday JAN 4. i've been on the phone with amazon for over 25 minutes with my 3rd amazon representative as they ""search the database"" to figure out what happened.Wish I'd bought the Sony! At least I could have swapped it the same day so he could have taken it on the winter trip the gift was originally intended for.--And No, this isn't a bad Amazon review, I love Amazon. I'm a happy prime member, I buy everything on here.There are many digital book devices to choose from, and with emerging technology like this your chances of a dud are higher. Considering that Amazon has replacement issues (like mine) with this device, I recommend you look at other devices. (sorry amazon)"
3,new owner,"i've enjoyed my kindle, which i've had for about a month especially the mobility. My main issue is the ponderous method to go back to reread something, Trying to find a certain passage can be a pain and then going back to your starting point takes way too much time. perhaps there is a method i don't know about that would make this easier but reading the manuals does not offer any help.Overall i like the kindle but it won't replace my local bookstores."
3,Love Kindle but Charger Wire Discintigrated,Loved my kindle - but the white charging wire fell apart. Went to charge my kindle & all the white plastic fell off in pieces. Very disappointed in that part
4,International Kindle,The Kindle is fine but to Australia it should ship with an Australian cable as computers etc do.I use my Kindle for travelling where I have no access to a computer. I have spent a lot of wasted time and money and effort trying to get a cable that works and matching international plugs so that I can use it for its intended purpose.Why isn't Kindle designed so you can use any USB charger?
3,Price Change,"Before I recieved my Kindle the price droped $40.00, Can a get a refund or credit towards future purchases?"
5,Love my Kindle!!!,"Yes, they dropped the price after I purchased my Kindle but with the pleasure of reading that I get from it doesn't matter to me. I have wanted a Kindle from the time it was introduced and I am loving it. Being able to read without the bulk of a hardcove or paperback still let's me read my favorite authors. I would and have been recommending the Kindle to everyone I know and I will continue to do so. Kindle, the best thing since sliced bread!!!!! LOLRun out and get a Kindle NOW....you will never put it down."
1,what a ripoff,"for far less, you can get a ebook reader with hugely more battery power, that will read most formats that ebooks are available in, and that *you* control, not amazon through their wireless connection that lets them control what you can and can't read, remember, with the kindle, you're renting books from amazon, not owning something you can do whatever you want to with."
4,"Nice to have, but won't give up paper books completely.","My Kindle arrived in late November, exactly when Amazon said it should, and I have found it to be a compact way to store a great deal of reading material -- wonderful for people who travel or are otherwise on the go. I have had a few problems with the small control buttons; I've accidentally gone to the Purchase page when I wanted to download a sample first. However, the staff at Amazon seems to resolve accidental purchases like that quickly and easily.These minor difficulties in usage, though quickly handled, and the fact that it is a rather expensive electronic device do lead me to say that even though the Kindle is convenient in some situations, I don't think I'll give up ""real"" paper books completely."
1,Great concept but very easily damaged. HANDLE WITH CARE!,"I love the concept and love the functionality. Unfortunately, it is very easily damaged. Unlike the ""drop test"" video shown, it can drop 30 to 36 inches and be unrepairable. My 45-day old Kindle just dropped out of its protective pouch while I was carrying it and the screen is ruined. I called customer service and they are sending me a replacement device for around $150 with taxes. Dropping is not covered with the regulard warranty and is only covered once with the extended warranty."
2,Stay with ur Kindle 1,"Kindle 1 has many features that are not included in Kindle 2; off-line storage, included cover, replaceable battery ..... I went for the kindle 2 for the text to speech and now that is going to be limited.Actually with the increase in cost of new titles, $15.39 instead of the $9.99 Amazon promised, I may go back to Amazon's used book feature.4/29/09. The cost of new hard covers was advertised as being $9.99. I am seeing more new books with a kindle price of over $15. If this is due to the text-to-speech feature, then people with kindle 1 are really getting a raw deal.2/13/10. OK big publishers, you win. You have forced me to wait 3 months to receive a kindle version or buy a cheaper yet hard cover copy. Now really, what do you think I will do?"
1,Better solution,"For this price I can buy a laptop. With a cheap laptop I can read books, read e-mail, browse the net, pay bills, play games, listen to music, share and store pictures and many more activities.This gadget needs to come down on price to be realistic."
1,Kindle 2 Screen went blank,I recently bought the Kindle 2 for my grandmother who loves to read but can no longer get out of the house to pick up books. I thought this would be an awesome gift for her since I have the Kindle 1 and LOVE it. Well I gave it to her this past Sat. We registered it and she was looking at it and it fell off her lap onto the carpet and the screen went blank and now it won't start up. Now Amazon is stating that the warranty does not cover damages. HOWEVER it was only dropped at most 2 feet from the couch to the carpet. I was given the option to pay another $200.00 to buy a refurbished Kindle 2... Which means that I now will be paying $570.00 for a used Kindle 2.I am VERY disappointed in Amazon. My grandmother didn't even purchase 1 book on this device and now we are out $270.00
4,Rather decent,"The ""no glare"" screen is OK, there is very little glare for the person holding/ looking directly at it but if you've anyone looking at it crossways there is a normal amount of glare. The controls are pretty direct (they're well labled and positioned well for relaxed reading) but some of the on-screen menus can be tricky. I don't know if that's the Kindle's fault or the publisher's though. I like it, the person I bought it for likes it, and our kids like it (well enough anyways...) so if you're looking for a reader this is probably the one to get."
5,My new red dress,"I'm not a tech head or a very fast reader, but my Kindle is my new red dress. You know, something everyone notices when you open it up. And now, after I tell them all about it, they have Kindle lust. I even downloaded my scriptures so I take it to Sunday school. The accessories to my Kindle are the book light and a red leather M-edge Kindle cover that I had my name embossed in gold on the cover. I am a very satisfied consumer and can't wait to get back to reading or listening to my precious Kindle.I'm on my second Dirk Pitt novel in a month. I have never read a book so fast. I'm very proud to be a part of this new wave of technology. I guess I'll be filling up my library shelves with pictures of my grand children and not storing books. That's OK with me!"
5,The best e-book reader by far!,"I own a kindle 1 and kindle 2. I love them both. My husband got me the kindle 2 for my birthday. I wasn't sure that I wanted one, but when it got here it was the best present I have ever received. I love the text to talk, it works alout better than I thought it would. I also love the fact they made the next and previous page buttons a little bit harder to push so I am not constantly pressing buttons I don't mean to. I think it is funny that people on here that don't even own a kindle at all are rating the kindle with 1 star. You don't know how great something is unless you have used one or own one. They are great, I love my kindle 1 and 2."
1,Defective By Design,"Let's see here:1. The device costs hundreds of dollars2. I don't ""own"" the books I buy, I merely license the content3. I can't share books with friends or give them away to a library where others may enjoy them....wish I could give it less than 1 star!"
5,Better than a book,"This is better than carrying around books. Since I teach an English Literature class, I can carry the Kindle around instead of 5 or 6 novels at one time. It is great and easy to read, and downloading a book is easy. Some of the classics are even free. Can't beat that!"
4,"I love it, but....","I think the kindle is great. The ability to get books delivered right to you on release days is extremely convenient. It is great just the way it is, but there are a couple of things that I wish it had. I think it should have the ability to be password protected since you can shop directly from the store. Also, the search feature when you shop needs to be easier. It is difficult to find books when you are doing a search. I have searched on authors and it has not come up with soon to be released books. I can find them, if I know the title and search that way. It would also be nice if the kindle came with the ability to light the screen to read in the dark. Available from the menu screen that you can turn off when not needed. Also, the ability to sort your library of books by author or title rather than just newest at the top. Different designs for the leather cover would also be nice."
1,Available aluthors,"Actually, I am writing because I am torn between buying either the kindle or the nook. It looks like Barnes and Noble has more authors that I prefer. I would like to see your list [as of, say, September 30, 2009] of currently available ebook authors, in alphabetical order. This will help me decide which company has the library I want to purchase. I am interested on both fiction and non-fiction. Thanks."
3,Ripped by Amazon,"I bought the Kindle2 in late March as Amazon touted it as the latest, greatest thing. They knew all along that they were putting out a better Kindle in May but kept it secret and now won't provide an upgrade. The Kindle2 is adequate but the business practice is wrong. Amazon just shot themselves in the foot with this outrage. This will probably be the last major purchase I ever make at Amazon."
5,Love it,"I am new to Kindle, I received it a s a Xmas present and I love the simplicity of it; I love that I can download a book in a minute and the ability to switch to audio is great. The free software so I can read from my computer is great feature. I love the fact that I can share books with whomever and not having to carry a bag with me constantly to hold my books is an added plus!!!"
1,Don't believe what you read,"We were told the price of a book would be $9.99 or less. I waited for the new Harlan Coban book to be released today because when I tried to preorder it, the price was $15.37. Well, guess what, the price is still $15.37! I can buy the actual book for a dollar more! Why in the world would I pay this much for a Kindle and still pay almost full price for a book. The promise was false and I'm extremely disappointed in this. I just got my Kindle in February and am once again waiting for a book to come out in paperback. Loved the product until now. I will not pay $400 for a device so that I can pay full price for a book. You have no printing costs, no stocking fees, no delivery fees - why am I paying the same price???"
5,Amazing,I'm not going to write a long review. You can read about all the specs on the Kindle page. I received mine as a gift. It has not left my side since. I think it's perfect for those who love to read. If you like the feel of the book in your hand it's not for you. I haven't played with any of the options because i've been to busy reading it. Once i do i'll be back to update. Hope this helps.
1,Disappointed,My Kindle lasted about 18 months and then its screen failed and it was useless. I elected not to replace it given its short life.
5,Love it!,"If you are thinking about buying a Kindle, don't hesitate another minute. I've had zero problems with mine and any questions I had were easily answered by checking the manual or a quick call to support. I read at least a couple of books a week. Because the Kindle books are slightly cheaper, I feel like it will pay for itself in time with what I save not buying paperbacks. There are also many great books now available for free for your Kindle. I love my tech toys and this is my favorite. Not to mention I can now have hundreds of books at my fingertips without needing tons of shelf space. You won't regret this purchase. My only complaint is when the books I want are not available in Kindle format, but more & more are becoming available. I have also had no trouble putting books on my Kindle that were purchased from sites other than Amazon."
5,Two words: Love it!!!!,"What can I say, but I love it!!!! I bought this as a treat for myself, and thought I might miss having the 'feel' of a good book in my hands. This is better than that! I have a library at my disposal!!!! Only gripe, I wish there was a built in reading light intead of having to find my light from the last place I used it."
5,Mi primer kindle,"Mi primer kindle, despues de kindle tuve un sony reader, despues del sony reader me quedo con los kindle... ."
1,Do i buy or rent your books?,"Like many others, the fact that Amazon has not only built in the capability to delete your books as they want but has actually done it, is incredibly scary. I bought and paid for what I wanted but apparently Amazon's wants override mine.I'll rather have a standalone device which I control and I can use as I want, rather than what Amazon lets me do.That this happened with George Orwell's books? Laughable and incredibly ironic."
3,I like my Kindle,I am really enjoying my Kindle. I had a little problem with my 1st one. The headphone outlet for the text to speech feature would only work for the left headphone. I called customer help and they sent me a new one. So I am happy again.
4,Great E Book reader,Wish it were in color but all in all it does it's job and is sleek. I returned it because I wanted to use it to view PDF documents but the print was too small and I didn't care for the conversion fee. It is a great e book reader though.
5,"Love, Love, Love My Kindle","I was hesitant to purchase this pricey unnecessary device, however, the benefits outweigh the price! I love using my Kindle. I have always enjoyed reading but as I get older my eyesight is not as good as it once was. The Kindle allows me to change the typeset without having to purchase large cumbersome books with large print. I also love the weight. I have weak wrists and this device helps with being able to hold it for longer periods of time, thereby lengthening my reading pleasure."
5,Finally in Amsterdam The Netherlands,"Better than books ! Everything I hoped and expected. Even better battery life since the upgrade. I love reading it in bed because the keyboard raises the screen up so I can rest it on my chest and relax.Screen is great, when I unpacked it, I could believe the instructions were actually a screen diagram."
4,Kindle your love of books,"I have had my Kindle for a couple months now and I am a satisfied customer. As a post graduate professor, the convenience of being able to carry a number of books in one Kindle is fantastic for travel and study. I am even reading novels again. In my profession being able to get to a number of books at once is absolutely essential.One draw back is that books in my field are not readily available on Kindle, still I am surprised at the number that are and it seems to be growing. Thanks Kindle you've made my load a little lighter.I am also using the other features on the Kindle. I like being able to dens pdfs of my own work to my Kindle. I also enjoy being able to listen to my music on Kindle while reading. The limited connectivity to the Internet has gotten me out of a couple of jams while on the run."
1,Sorry I purchased it!,"I was very excited about purchasing the Kindle. I heard that only brand new books were priced at $9.99 and perhaps a little higher, while older books would be around $1.99 to $5.99. The only time the kindle will be of use to me is when l am traveling. I noticed that l can purchase new paperbooks cheaper at Walmart, Target, Costcos etc. I went to purchase James Pattersons new book because l could get it at a pre-release price of $8.99 as the book would be released on February 2, 2010. When l purchased the book, the receipt said l would get the book May 2, 2010. Is there some kind law that says one must wait and extra three months for electronic books or is this a scam. I can not tell you how disappointed l am. Was so looking forward to using the product, but will only use it when l travel. There is no other reason to use it other than not having to carry 10-15 books with me."
5,I love my new Kindle!,I love this thing! The screen is amazing! I definitely recommend buying this product if you are looking for an e-reader!
4,Has well organized buttons than Kindle 1,"Kindle 2 is a very good product, but it is pricey and it doesn't come with book holder.I wish amazon included book holder for the money they charge. I will rate this product to 5, if they have options to organize ebooks."
3,Not happy,"First let me say that I like the concept of an e-book reader. I don't use it a lot, preferring to hold the book or paper, but it certainly is useful on many occasions (traveling, during blood donations, etc).BUT--having received the Kindle 1 as a gift in May 2009, and finding it was not useful outside the United States, I was disappointed, since I travel a lot internationally and it would be a definite benefit while on the airplane or on the road.Now the ""newer"" version DOES have onternational access, but Amazon will not upgrade (or cannot) the original Kindle, and I am not about to shell out another $259 for a second one just for international travel. I feel that Amazon has left the millions of us who have the original just hanging, and have made our original investments obsolete."
2,unhappy service area is sooooooo limited,coverage within maine is serviced by AT&T which covers less than a 1/3 of the state! Bad business when considering we live in a wireless society.
5,I looooove my Kindle 2,"My husband got me the Kindle 2 because I love to read. This was the best gift ever! I have a very long commute to work so this is perfect for an hour train ride each way and the text to speech is great for when I'm driving. I love that there are so many choices of reading materials (books, magazines, articles, etc). If it came standard with a book light, that would have been nice but any clip on booklight seems to work well with it in it's case...so I really have no complaints. It's awesome!"
1,"A Larger Device, yet no SD Memory Card Slot?","What's up with that? I want to bring the ""rest"" of my library with me. Plus, the thing is huge. Oh well, maybe by Kindle 5 or 6, Amazon will get it right."
3,love it.... but....,"i've had a kindle since it first came out. i love it! i have a ton of books on it, and it goes everywhere i go. the BUT comes in and applies to the fact that the price for the downloads has been going up and up. what used to be around $10 has been going up towards $15 or more.this is very disappointing. since the cost of the kindle is high anyway, the benefit, other than easy storage, was the reduced price of book downloads. if you buy as many books as i do, you may want to rethink this purchase. :-("
1,Back Button not responding,"This is my 2nd kindle after my 1st device was replaced due to malfunctioning key pads. Once again, I'm having a similar problem w/ the replacement- The back button suddenly not responding only after 4 days of ownership. My previous kindle was replaced only 6 days of ownership b/c all the buttons were suddenly stalled!!!. The tech support told me to try to re-set, but after few tries, it went back to malfunctioning mode.Since I'm starting to see a similar issue again w/this device, I'm afraid that there may be some technical glitchs with the latest generation kindle."
4,Kindle International,"The Kindle initially worked well.It will only charge from the laptop however and isn't shipped with a power adaptor. No local USB charger will work which can be very annoying!!You need to be careful and check that the battery symbol shows the Kindle charging and not go by the yellow/green light. I was using this and the battery depleted, it took a lot of time charging for it to start again!Overall I am happy but when I am in the US next I will try and get a separate wall charger."
4,Technology for the non-technological,"I bought the Kindle as a present for my husband with the knowledge that if he didn't like it I could return it. I already tried to get him to like technology by buying him an iPod and that was a resounding failure (""too confusing"") so the return policy cinched the deal. Well to say he loves the Kindle is an understatement. A few simple lessons from me on how it works and he's been tearing through books and downloading them on his own without any problems. The interface is simple and pretty intuitive, it's easy on the eyes and very comfortable. The portability is a plus since it fits into the briefcase easily and safely, once you buy your own case, the only drawback. Nice item, especially if it appeals to the techno-phobe in the family."
4,Still prefer the Kindle for e-reading,"I've had this Kindle 2 for over 6 months now, and it's an amazing little device. Easy to read, intuitive to operate. Downside - for a heavy reader, the instant book aspect is both a wonder and a danger. Books when I want them at 1 a.m. - great! Addictive overspending on ebooks - bad! Took about a month to find a comfortable spending level. I've tried an iPhone for reading, and the Kindle is much easier to hold and read. One annoyance - it's a bit slow on the Whispernet - not dramatically so, but noticeable to someone who lives on the net."
4,A New Kindle Lover,"Yeah!! I love my Kindle. The only thing I'd change about it is I'd have a backlight on it so it'd be easier to read on airplanes during overnight flights, or in bed when someone else doesn't like the light on. Otherwise, I'm ecstatic with the concept and have to curb myself from buying too many books at once.Thank you, Amazon for making such a wonderful reading tool available."
4,I'm in love with my Kindle 2,"I was so excited of receiving my Kindle. I love it so much, it does not leave my purse. I have been reading a lot more since I purchased it about 2 months ago. I keep talking about it so much, that 3 of my friends had to buy it. The only think I can't wait for with the new model is COLOR! Please Amazon, make the next Kindle color! It would be so great to read a magazine on it, or view a blog, or a newspaper. I am not doing any of that right now, because monochrome is too sad...This is a product to absolutely have. I am a book lover, and still purchase certain books I would like to hold in my hands, but for day to day reading, like novels, it is the best product ever! SO practical. I just got back from a Puerto Rican beach, and it perfectly worked there. Some of my friends were talking a bout an author and a particular book, and I went on Amazon right away to order a sample. I love the instantaneity."
4,Good eReader,"Nice eReader, downloading was very good, intuitive interface, slim design, and I like the white color. My wish, an ability to change pages to a color (beige?)"
2,Price Drop Required,"As soon as the Kindle drops under $300 I will buy. Until then, no chance. I have heard and seen very similar feelings across the web. If Kindle 2 had been everything it was suppose to be, I would have gladly paid $359."
2,Top ten reasons to NOT buy a Kindle,Top ten reasons not to buy a Kindle:10. It's not recyclable;9. It doesn't smell like a book;8. You can't read it in the dark;7. You have to turn it off when taking off and landing in a plane;6. It's too easy to turn a page when you don't mean to;5. It's very difficult to go back and find something on a page unless it's just a page or two back;4. Every time a new version is released there's a new proprietary charging cord;3. Cost of material is fixed by a monopoly as there's no place other than Amazon to get content;2. Contents you buy can be changed or even deleted without your permission;1. It isn't a book.Edit on 4/1/10: Add 1A: It isn't an iPad.
2,New software doesn't update properly,"Got this US version on July 2009 and everything about this device is right on. Until I updated to new software version 2.3.My blog and news subscriptions won't update unless I reset or restart the device. After several calls with Kindle Tech, they said that there is a bug in the new software that they are working on. For now I am stuck with this device that I have to do a restart a dozen times a day to get updates. The whole soul of a wireless reader that auto update itself is gone with this experience I have."
1,Defective by design,"It's incredibly disappointing that a company as large as Amazon would have been so thoughtless as to summarily remove (with no notification!), materials from their users devices that the users had purchased and downloaded entirely legally and according to their user agreements [1].The fact that this is possible should be fair warning to anyone using these devices: The materials you purchase and download on to 'your' Kindle are not actually yours, and are not under your control whatsoever - Amazon owns that device and can (and clearly will) do as they see fit, regardless of any 'consumer rights' you may think you have.[...]"
3,Disappointed & Duped,I have not yet had a chance to down load any new books on my Kindle since I was finishing up a few unread books I had bought. One thing I have noticed though is that for some reason the battery runs down within a day or two even with the Kindle powered down. This is very disappointing since I believe it was advertised as lasting over a week on a full charge.Now for the Duped part of my review. You heavily advertised the reduced price for the Kindle around the time I purchased my Kindle. Today I learn the the 3RD generation Kindle was just released at the same price I bought mine for a month ago. This leads me to believe the advertising blitz was a plan to reduce your inventory of the old Kindles before the release of the new one. I would like to know I can send back my old (actually brand new) Kindle for a new 3rd generation Kindle. If you really care about my review you will respond to my concerns. Thank you.
4,Kindle 2: First impressions from a Sony Reader owner,"I wish I had bought this sooner. The user interface design is very good. I have really enjoyed using it so far.There is one downside even with the upgrade to 2.5 it doesn't read pdf's worth a flip. Yes, I can zoom but moving the screen around is VERY awkward. So I will still need to read my pdf's on my Sony Reader. Hint: Buy a Reader and then program the Kindle to view pdf's similar to it. It would be wonderful if that could be done since I have 350 pdf books on my Sony Reader.Other than that it is an awesome experience."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"First, I absolutely love dealing with Amazon. I have waited several years to get a Kindle. Wow, what a disappointment it was. I spent several hours trying to use the 5-way control button ...it didn't scroll properly, when it did, it went to to buy the book. Being new, I ended up with a couple of off the wall books I would never even consider. Well, I thought, I must be a complete idiot. I offered it to several of my friends to try to scroll ... and they had no luck. I am really frightened to purchase another. The Kindle help line was very, very good and deleted what I didn't want. Did I have a defective unit? I sure haven't had a good experience with it and it is going back immediately."
4,Traveling with the Kindle,"I recently flew with the Kindle and found that the airlines are being more clear that Kindles must be turned off during takeoff and landing, like other electronic devices. I left mine in sleep mode but kept it tucked away. The downside of the Kindle is that if you're stuck on the tarmac for a long taxi and take-off, you can't read your book, which I found very frustrating, so a magazine is useful to tote along as well.Also, I prefer to carry it with me rather than leave it in a car on a hot day, which could damage the battery, so sometimes I have to tote it along even though I won't be using it.Other than those two issues, I love traveling with it!"
3,Roaming agreements missing,"Not being able to roam wirelessly outside of USA is obviously a disadvantage but learning why, would be quite interesting to learn."
3,"Not Perfect, but Good Option for Busy People","I had been using the Kindle app for the iPhone prior to buying my kindle. I was interested in having a larger screen. There is one feature I like from the iPhone app though, the ability to turn the page with my finger rather than a button. It is an intuitive action for most readers & allows me to get deeper into the content and forget that it's a device. I can forget that it's a Kindle until I have to turn a page. I do love the storage. I am usually reading several books at a time, so I like having all those options available to me. Do I still use both of my kindles? You bet I do! The reader stays home unless I'm traveling. Otherwise I have the reader on my phone. Thanks for a perfect, portable for busy readers to live life & still READ. I am now reading more than I have since my 20's. As a 40-something reader, I need larger print early in the day & the Kindle makes it easy to switch fonts. For that, I am appreciative. Here's to innovation!"
1,KINDLE IS A RIP OFF,"I have never been so disappointed in an electronic device. For starters, the battery does not hold a charge, even when the Kindle is off. Every time I go to pick it up, I have to plug in the power cord. This has been a problem since the first week I had it.There is no backlight like the Sony. For nearly $400, I find it to be almost useless and certainly not up to the Hype that Oprah gave it on her show.Less than three months after the big push for the Kindle on the Oprah show, the new and improved Kindle was offered to me for the same price.All I can say is ""HOW STUPID DO YOU THINK CONSUMERS ARE?""YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT ME EVER BUYING ANYTHING FROM YOU AGAIN AND I TELL EVERYONE I MEET TO BUY THE SONY VERSION AND STAY AWAY FROM YOUR LOSER KINDLE."
1,This is Where Negative Kindle Reviews Belong,"Actually this is just turn about for all of the many, many one star reviews that are cluttering up new books released after April 1, 2010. Many, many authors are getting very negative feedback for something that is none of their fault. Just because Amazon and some publishers cannot come to terms is no reason for the authors (and readers) to suffer from what is primarily a spamming of book reviews.No, I do not own a Kindle and will not ever bother with one. If I feel the need (or can afford it) I will probably go with the Nook as they sound much better in many ways.One other question for Amazon----why are these false reviews not being removed after being reported as unsuitable? I know that I am reporting every one that I come across, but haven't seen any removals."
4,Business and Education options,"Great on the eye's and save's bookshelve space. Enjoy the the notes feature, highlights, etc. This is an unbelievable tool for business. Looked into getting one each for our kids high school and college education, however, most educational books are not on the kindle and there are no plans. would love to see one available for the blind as well. Overall great product, can see a huge future in it for educational purposes. - JC"
2,Mis-led,"I bought a KindleKindle Wireless Reading Device (6"" Display, Global Wireless, Latest Generation)in the belief that I would be able to download the majority of current best-selling authors. This turns out to be a complete misapprehension.In Australia we can download virtually none of the best selling authors. Name an author and you can bet it is not available on Kindle (of course available from Amazon in hard copy..at a price). The only exceptions are so far as I can see, Stephanie Meyer and Stieg Larsson.Is this going to change or have I completely wasted $259?"
4,I like my Kindel,"I like my Kindel, it becomes adictive and will make me read more.The drawback is the cost of books if you were only reading paperbacks. The cost of reading will go up since the 9.99 or 14.99 price is based on the hardcopy price and when the paperback comes out they only drop the price $2.The second drawback is the lack of page numbers and the flash when you go to a new page."
5,"Love It, Love It, Love It","After much debate over this one and the new DX, I chose the smaller one. I like the fact that you can 'next page' from either side of it. I do a lot of travelling and I love the size, it fits into any mid size purse. The 3G is awesome. I don't know what to say other than I believe this is a great investement for any reader! Also I am a Canadian, and have my Canadian address in Amazon, so when I got my kindle it automatically connected me, but to Amazon.ca, you can go into your account and change it to US. I did this because Amazon.com offers way more ebooks and a lot more free ones!"
4,The iPad is no threat,"If you're comparing this with the iPad, hands down the Kindle is a better option. My iPad is limited, heavy, and not enjoyably to read on. You will be much more satisfied with this higher quality product."
2,PDF Compatibility for Kindle 2,"Ok so I bought my new Kindle for two reasons. One was to get myself interested in reading a good book again, and the second reason (the more important one)was so that I could transfer the bucket load of manuals I am required to reference to one easy to read digital device. All the manuals are in PDF form so the transfer was simple enough, now the problem is trying to read them. The files open no problem, but there is no zoom function to actually read them. If one sells a product that reportedly is compatible to a certain file format it should at the very least give you the ability to read the text should it not? Is there a software fix in the works? Do I send it back and swallow the 15% re-stocking fee? I just hope Amazon monitors these feedback loops because I have no idea where else to send it for help."
5,Kindle Rocks!!!,I love my Kindle2! I love to read and it makes it so easy to take with me anywhere I go and be able to just sit and read. Best thing I have bought for myself in years!!
5,Kindle,"I have been wanting a Kindle from the first time it was advertised, and now that I have one I'm sorry I had to wait so long to purchase one. Having books almost the minute you decide you would like to read them, is amazing."
2,"good product, far too expensive","The kindle works well for what it does, but the device is too expensive,and the books are too expensive."
1,Would I buy this for status?,I can buy a netbook with color for less. This is more an ignorance symbol than a status symbol.
5,never without a new book!,I cannot say enough good things about this device! The battery life is amazing and the whisper-net is perfect for the usability of this book! if you read a lot of books and have come to the end of your current reading material late in the evening.....well never fear! a new book is 60 seconds away!
5,Just what she wanted,"Very nice! Although it was a refurb unit, works and looks like new! Its what she wanted, got it for her as a gift. Just had a little trouble changing the account name and info over to her. If you buy it, its all under your name. So if you're going to buy it as a gift for someone else, its a little tricky. Regardless, it works great! She's already downloaded a few books, and almost done reading them. The adjustment of font sizes really helps in various environments. Her favorite is to go to Starbuck's and sit and read it. Not ready for the iPad yet. Still lots of money for that. For reading books and documents, this thing is plenty good and cool."
4,grab your bifocals,"The Kindle 2 is fascinating and wonderfully useful. Only two problems: If you are in the bifocal stage, the letters are way too light on the keys (not the text--that is okay, although the text size of the dictionary definitions at the bottom of the page does not expand either). The same problem applies to the battery indicator--way too faint. Crucial problems? Not at all, just really irritating."
2,nook is better really !!!,"NOOK is better really , and the reason is the amazon.com didnt put it when you search about it in their website ....you even can go to Barns & noble website and you will see a striking caparison between nook and this device "" i duno whats even called"" !!!its even cheaper !!! compared to its functions with this thing !!"
5,Easy Reader,I purchased my Kindle2 just before a long plane trip and I am delighted to say that while I was traveling I was able to read three novels. They easily fit into my handbag because they were stored on my new Kindle2.
4,Excellent device... but could be better,"I bought this for my husband's birthday, and we have both been fighting over it since. It took a little getting used to (because we were distracted by the features) but we loved it as soon as we found our way around it. It is a great device, and extremely handy for travelling. I am considering getting a second one for myself too, but am holding out for some better features in the next version, hopefully...- backlight would be great for reading in the dark- wireless access outside of the US for downloading books- maximise reading screen by having a touchscreen keyboard, which appears on screen only when required- ability to easily jump from chapter to chapterIt is a shame that none of the major travel publications are available for download, eg. Lonely Planet, Footprint,. I was travelling around South America for 6 months last year - and it would have been extremely handy to have this on a Kindle rather than lugging a thick heavy book around."
4,My Kindle Review,"I have waited a little over two weeks to do this review. In that time, I have read two books on my Kindle. I have to say that I am satisfied overall with my purchase. It is the ease of use that allows me to look forward to reading books I am interested in. While I buy electronics on a regular basis, this will be one of the items I use on a regular basis. If you have been trying to decide which e-reader is for you, try Kindle. The one downside I believe is not having a backlight but that can be easily solved with a separate purchase."
3,"Product OK, Price of books not OK","Happy with the product so far, easy to use and much more convenient than having books all over the place.Not so happy with the price of new books, was given the impression that 9.99 was the price. I guess it's sucker them into buying the divice and raise the price of books gradually.As I stated earlier happy with the product, enjoy the newspaper and ease of obtaining books. Since I have it in hand will continue to purchase books I like, but will be reticent to buy other products in the future."
2,good for USA,"I bought Amazonkindle 2, this item is good for who is living in USA because U Cannot use your kindle out side USA and to by e-book from amazon.com you should have credit card issued in USA otherwise you cannot bay, Sony 505 or later much better than Amazonekindle."
1,Kindle is wasting my time---defective from the start,"I have owned a kindle for less than two weeks. Yes, its a cool idea, blah, blah.And, on average, it crashes every third time I want to use it. Try to turn it on, its frozen. Sometimes takes up to an hour to re-boot and be able to access my materials again.This is NOT what I signed up for.Suggest you NOT buy one of these until they can fix the glitches. I am going to ask for a refund and move on to some other format.David Chard"
2,"OK, but newer ones better, also needs a touch screen","Just 1 week after I purchased this Kindle .. out came the Wi-Fi kindle for 50.00 less. Then in another week, they had Wi-Fi as well as free 3G for the same money I paid for 3G only. The newer ones have a better button configuration and no longer have the hideous 5 way button that you have to have fingers the size of a pencil to operate. Moving the curser is slow and somewhat unresponsive which is annoying. A touch screen would eliminate this issue. It would be great if they're going to upgrade these every week if they'd offer a trade-in plan."
4,AWSOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"My husband purchased this as my birthday gift. I happened to see people using this when we were in Aruba. Being an avid reader I thought, WOW. what a way to have a bookstore at your fingertips!! It is something that is easy to use, the variety is great, I loved the library before, but I have it right in the palm of my hands. I brought it to work, and people loved it, they are looking into buying it also, I have pitched this device to everyone I meet. The fast delivery of the books, to the cover, this device is well made. I have to say to anyone reading this, BUY IT!! You will not be disappointed."
1,"Not the same as ""owning"" anything","Now that Amazon has clawed back Orwell's two major books from Kindle owners who bought them in good faith, I would never consider buying one.Amazon deleted the book from owners' Kindles without consulting them. I will never trust Amazon to provide digital copies of anything."
1,Cannot buy good books,"From Japan. I'm irritated that I cannot buy good books and bestsellers with Kindle. For example, Twilight No.4 Breaking dawn, Eragon by Christopher Paolini, Stargirl by Jerry Spinelli, Cat's Cradle, The Sirens of Titan, Mother Night by Kurt Vonnegut, and so on.If I cannot read the books that I want to read with Kindle, it's useless!!!!Kindle is slim and not heavy, it's really beautiful.It's a shame!Please prepare these books for customers!!!!!"
5,I love this thing...,"After having made my wishes known for a long time, I received a Kindle as an anniversary gift from my husband. I was so excited and pleased, but also a little intimidated, wondering how long it would take to become comfortable with this new technology. The answer came quickly as I tried to ""turn"" a page shortly into my second book! I had to chuckle as I realized I had reached up to the screen to turn the page."
4,Kindle review,Superb gadget - really excellent interface - very convenientLittle dissapointing that not all books are available for download
5,"Kindle in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia Canada",I purchased this for my wife (and myself if I ever get to use it) and she opened it on Christmas Morning. I think this is one of the few times I think my wife was truly speechless. It works great and the ease of use is amazing. This device is a great gift and is even better than I heard it was. Thank You.
5,Money Well Spent!!,"The Kindle is without a doubt the best investment I have ever made. I carry reference books, the bible, and numerous works of fiction. The prices are fantastic! Any person that loves to read should have a kindle!!"
5,The Kindle is Fantastic!!,"I love the kindle. I had my reservations as I have ""older"" eyes, however this was quickly put to rest. I have the option to change the size of the font so I don't need to strain my eyes. I also don't need a bright light on my book...it can easily be read with just a light next to me. I love that there is a turn page button on each side...I do however wish there was a back page button on both sides but not enough to not give the kindle 5 stars. The built in dictionary is fast and convenient. I can travel lighter now and if I finish a book its a quick push of the button to get another one. I highly recommend getting a case and a protector for the screen. I opted for a hard case and bought the soft casecrown kindle case to hold the kindle and my accessories. The CaseCrown case easily holds the kindle with the hard case on it and the accessory pouch holds my charger and my light. If you love to read this is the product for you."
4,Kindle outside of 3G,"I live outside of the 3G network area, and find the Kindle as easy to use as if it was an ipod. Can not say enough good things about the Kindle and have recommended it to all of my friends and family because it is so user friendly, and that if you read enough it will pay for it's self."
5,Love my Kindle!,"I have had my Kindle for about a month and thoroughly enjoy it! It is convenient, easy to purchase and download books and the battery life is great. I have also downloaded a few audio books from another application which was a very simple process. Thanks for an amazing product!"
5,Greatest book ever,I love the kindle 2 I have had it for about fifteen days now. I wish I HAD GOTTEN ONE A LONG TIME AGO. IT WAS VERY SIMPLE TO GET STARTED READING. I am 75 years old and if I can do it any one can. A big fan of the Kindle.
1,Never purchase a Kindle product again,"The Kindles I've purchased have both had to be replaced due to screen malfunctions. I'm on vacation and I have to go buy a book. When contacting kindle the only option is replacement. I want a refund due to the poor kindle product quality. Since I've had 2 go bad I don't think there is one that will work for a year and would opt to return for a full refund. DON'T BUY IT, IT WON'T LAST LONG ENOUGH TO GET ENOUGH USE TO JUSTIFY THE HIGH PURCHASE COSTS. THANK YOU"
1,Kindle2,"I purchased a Kindle2 one month ago. On a recent trip, it fell out of my hands to the ground. It was in it's Kindle cover. Now 3/4 of an inch of the top portion is blank. I can no longer read it without constantly switching fonts. I called customer service and was told, ""I am sorry this is not covered by your warranty. If you pay another $200 we can replace it for you!"" Since there was no warning indicating that dropping a Kindle would render it unusable, I cannot recommend it to anyone who ever drops anything. Although I truly enjoyed this product for the month I had it, I cannot recommend that someone pay $385 for it."
4,a gift for 75 year-old woman,"The recipient of my gift was very surprised and excited; we talked about reading the directions for set up and use but time ran out and we left for our homes, 1000 miles apart.I got a formal thank-you letter but have heard nothing more...I wonder if it is difficult to use."
3,Left hand,"My father has the first Kindle. It has been great. My father has MS, has been forced to use his left hand. With the Kindle there are no paper pages for him to fight as he goes to the next page -- at the push of a button the page is turned. BUT - it would be great if the Kindle 2 had the ""menu"" button on the left side of the machine. Then he could ""search"" selected words from the page."
5,Kindle 2 the only way to read books.,After getting the Kindle I do not like to hold and read a regular book. When I bought the Kindle I had buyers remorse because of the price. I am cheap and got most of my books from the Library. the Kindle has so many things that you can do with the web browser and there are many very inexpensive books to read at the Amazon store that just in a few days I quite worrying about the price. Get a cover for it immediately. It is so thin and smooth I was afraid I would drop it.
3,Kindle expensive to use,"I bought this Kindle because I was amazed by your video of introductionAfter I received it, I really like it, but I am very disappointed by the small choice of books availableThe first 3 books I wanted to purchase were not available in Kindle versionPlus I feel the price is high for a virtual copy. It should be much cheaper than the paper book, however, this is only the case if you compare with the hard copy book price after release. If you compare with a soft cover book price, the Kindle version is higher.I hope this will change, otherwise, I will simply put this Kindle in a drawer and forget it"
4,Makes Reading Easier,"You never need to leave your house again to be able to read any book you want. Downloading is easy. Only had one problem downloading a book, then realized I was in an area that was not covered by internet. So just download a book before you get in this kind of area. This is my second Kindle. I also have the first Kindle. So easy to store all your books where ever you please. Love being able to look up words, change font size,and listen to the book read it's self to me. With this second I am disappointed that it does not come with a cover. That is a separate cost. Not, in my opinion a good business decision. So love my kindle even though it has no cover."
4,E Reading device,I really like this product and portable and easy to read even in the brightest light. Is a bit heavier than I expected but love it.
4,Totally Worth It!,"Overall, I am very pleased with my Kindle 2. The best thing about it is the portablility it gives you, especially when traveling. You no longer have to agonzie over which books to pack since the Kindle will do that for you. It is an incredible space saver--no more piles of books for me to trip over or knock down!There are only 2 major issues I have--otherwise I'd give my rating as 5 stars.1. No folders or way of organizing your books on the Kindle--everything is in one long list.2. The one-click buy feature makes it way too easy to accidentally purchase a book and if you are not quick enough to use the cancel option, then you have to contact customer service for a refund.Overall, I definitely recommend the Kindle for people who love to read and want the portability and convenience that it offers. The Whispernet wireless connection makes downloading or shopping addictively easy! I carry mine everywhere with me just in case I need something to help pass the time."
2,Not For Readers of Literary Fiction,"This is a nice device, but doesn't work well with my reading habits. Many major literary writers (including Nobel or Pulitzer prize winners) have nothing or almost nothing available for kindle. I'm rather shocked. Being out of the country I was hoping I could just purchase books on kindle, so I wouldn't have to search out hard copies of English language books. I've only purchased a couple of things in six months. I just never found what I was looking for. And I'm not talking about anything esoteric. I'm talking about well-known works by writers like Herman Hesse, M. Scott Momaday, Angela Carter and Carson McCullers. Pretty major names in literary fiction. Disappointing."
2,A WORD OF CAUTION : Good for Novels but not for Techinal PDFs,"I used to read a lot of technical books in pdf format with lots of diagrams in it. I am not happy the way pdfs are displayed in it(Tooo small to read). Its excellent device for the people who read more of novels. For me its a one star device but a extra star is for the packaging ,delivery and wonderful customer care support. Not worth of the price to me(delivery charges to OUTSIDE US customers) and on top of that they do not have wireless coverage to my area. I Could have bought something cheaper."
1,Not worth the money anymore,"I bought a Kindle to save money on purchasing books and to not have to store so many of the ones I love to read over and over, as well as for travel. However, in the 8 months I have owned the Kindle, I have seen the availability of newly released books on kindle decline, and the price of each book (some MORE than the hardcover price) increase dramatically. With all the new mediums of e-books out there and coming in the future, I'd hold off on a Kindle purchase until Amazon can get their act together with new book release availability and pricing."
4,Kindle 2 Review,"I am new to the Kindle 2. I have been reading and waiting for these products to make improvements. I can honestly saw. I do love my Kindle 2. The text from book are clear and crisp even in sunlight. I love the American dictionary already included. Excess to the kindle store is easy to use. The download is quick and easy as well. The battery life is quite long without having to constintly having to find a outlet to charge up. On the most part, I'm happy with my Kindle 2. However, there are a few things that Amazon needs to work on.1. More publishing companies need to be incorporated into the Kindle family. More Afro-American Authors.2. All Public Libraries should be available.3. There seems to be a lot of repeats of titles.I hope this helps others."
4,love my kindle 2,"I love my Kindle2, i can read my books more quickly using the kindle. i take it every where i go and read when i get a spare minitue."
1,Not going to purchase...,Sorry Amazon you just made absolutely sure that I will not purchase any form of Kindle thanks to the possibility of losing any random title or all of them at a moment's notice due to the whim of corporate politics.I'll spend for something else that doesn't contain DRM. More if I have to.
1,Outrageous,"If I buy a very expensive print edition of a book, I am thinking of a $150 specialized book on Venice, why can't I have a Kindle copy too? Instead I have to choose. Kindle copy is $120.Information and Communication in Venice: Rethinking Early Modern PoliticsSo both would be $270. Outrageous!As a fan of Venitian history I would like to read a hard copy at home but have it with me when I travel. But $270? You have to be kidding!"
1,No reviews I read indicated that images are now available in color,"If images in Kindle II are or aren't available in color, this should be stated in Amazon's Kindle II description. From what I have read, it does not seem to matter to Amazon or the other reviewers. However, the world is not B&W, and color carries information that is often important in newspapers, books with diagrams, books on art, etc. If I am mistaken, then don't print this. Thanks."
1,Orwell would laugh and shout at Jeff,"Ok, so the Thought police is a live and well. Welcome Big brother.I was going to get a K2 in Dec but after reading the many reviews about missing paid content and the latest yanking of the 1984 book, perhaps never now. Ipod Touch 3g Here I come."
1,not good,"I have had the Kindle for 4 months and am very disappointed, I have had to purchase books in paper back because the new releases are not availiable to me on the Kindle. I pre-order my book waited for 2 months and was sent a Email that it is not availiable on the Kindle and this has happened 2 times. I have to say that I will not recommend this to my friends and I have purchased the Sony on recommendation of friends that it was better and had a larger selection of books that I am interested in. Louise"
5,Amazing,"This is the most amazing electronic I have ever owned. It is fast to get a book and I find myself reading more and more. My only complaint would be that books are not always on Kindle when they are released. That is a shame as I no longer want to carry a book around with me. I take this to my doctor's office and can read until called without worry. When I get up to go with the nurse if I haven't marked the page and we are to long doing the usual doctor visit things, it marks my page and goes into a sleep mode. Love it. I am an avid reader but this is so much easier than a book. I don't get watery eyes from the white page behind the print. My husband said I always have my nose in my Kindle. I read more than ever. This is a great buy."
2,Purchase the Warranty,I've been a very happy Kindle 2 user for a little over a year (which means I paid the original $349 price). That changed this weekend when it went on the fritz and started randomly typing searches in the middle of reading-eventually rendering it unusable unless you like to read a page at a time. It was like it was possessed. Research online shows that this is not an uncommon problem and is caused by a hardware issue. Unfortunately my device is out of warranty. I was surprised to find out that Amazon has not invested in a service center for Kindle so instead of being able to send for repair the only options are to shell out $90 for a refurbished kindle (with only a 90 day warranty) or replace it completely for $190 and add an extra $65 for the 2 year warranty. Clearly they are not making these products to last so definitely purchase an extended warranty.
5,Love my Kindle!,"I broke my wrist and was having a hard time holding a book and messing with the pages. My husband bought me the Kindle and it makes it possible to read without any trouble. I am reading more than ever and I can't believe how user friendly the Kindle is. I love my Kindle so much that I made sure to buy one for my daughter, daughter-in-law, and my husband before the Christmas rush. Not only did I buy the Kindle again, but I bought it again and again. This is by far the best purchase we have made from Amazon!"
5,Fantastic,"I am rapt about the Kindle. Interestingly a friend loaned me a book and after starting reading it, I realised how much I preferred reading from a Kindle as I had missed the dictionary and search facility. Ended up returning book to friend and bought the Kindle version !!! My only disappointment is that I was charged freight for cover, light and Kindle separately even though I ordered all at the same time."
2,CAUTION! Must order a cover!,"I got one of the first Kindle 2s. It arrived before the announced release date. I loved it for the couple of weeks that I owned it.On Mar 17, I had a heart attack. I had my wife bring the Kindle to the CCU where I immediately let it slip from my hands for about a 2.5 foot drop to the linoleum. Scrambled display. Sorry. Not covered by warranty.This unit has a brushed aluminum back and smooth plastic front that is very slippery and hard to grip. If you do not order a cover, preferably thick leather for padding and grip, you are likely to have a short relationship with your Kindle 2."
5,Kindle Review,LOVE IT!!!! OMG! I had to wait for Santa to deliver this item and had wanted it in 2008 for Christmas.
2,Simple Review,"Decent Product, Bad Format Support, No RSS Reader (big mistake), Books should be lower price, they are digital, not trees. Starting to regret my purchase a little bit."
2,Drop Test,"Note in the drop test video, the machine is not shown to operate after the test. I recently dropped my Kindle which was encased in the leather binder onto a wood floor. The Kindle no longer worked. Even though the unit was only week old Amazon would not replace the unit with out a charge of $135."
5,My Portable Library,"I was uncertain whether I should spend $359 for another electronic device, but this is truly money well spent. At its best, technology should make our lives easier, and give us more freedom and choices. The Kindle delivers on that. When I travel, or even when I sit in my living room, I don't have to decide what books or magazines to have with me - they are all there on my Kindle in a very convenient and easy to use package. I love the design of the Kindle 2, it is easy to hold and easy to use. I am not sure I would like the DX as much because I find the size and portability of the Kindle to be perfect for me. The best thing about the Kindle is that I am reading more, and spending less time on my phone, PC, or watching TV, because it makes reading so accessible, easy, and fun. I love my Kindle!"
3,Great but woe to you if it breaks,"It took me a while to get used to but this is a very handy thing, especially for traveling. BUT - and this is a big BUT - when my son's Kindle that he got as a Christmas present broke - the screen suddenly went haywire - he was told that unless HE could prove that it was a manufacturing defect, it would cost $200 to fix. This is an item that is still theoretically under warranty. So, unless you want to keep forking out $$$$ for repairs, perhaps this is too expensive an option. Too bad, because for $10, I will buy newly released books."
4,kindle 2,I love my kindle but I live over seas. One of the reasons I purchased it was that books are so expensive here. Now that I am back in New Zealand my kindle can not down load books :( I have wireless in my home but get no signal for the kindle. What is the solution?? I want to purchase some of the wonderful new books you are advertising but have now way of doing this.
5,All it's advertised to be,"I saw a colleague's Kindle 2 and immediately ordered one. I have not regretted the decision even once, and have caused at least 2 more to be ordered by people who saw mine. It is so great to be able to carry 3 books with me on a flight in just the space of the Kindle. No more ""which book shall I carry to read on the outbound, and which on the inbound"" -- I can now carry them all!"
3,Convenient but soon to be outdated,"The device is pretty good overall. It needs a light. It needs a makeover. The issue is, with all the new tablets coming out, this will soon be ancient. I decided that the back light was a major issue for me, and returned it."
3,Get the extended warranty!,I have/had the first Kindle. I absolutely loved it. It worked fine for a year and a half. One day it just stopped working. Since it was over a year old the warranty was up. I called customer service and they said that all they could offer was a refurbished 1st generation Kindle for $99.00 with a 3 month warranty. I passed on that. So now I have $300.00 paper weight.
1,Too expensive and DRM is BS,"First off, for the price, I can buy any eReader, or even a net book/low end laptop.$300 is WAY TOO Expensive for this device. Amazon should aim for sub $100.Second, DRM means that Amazon can, has, and will remove the books you've paid for whenever they wish without warning.The End User License says that the product is licensed to you, but not sold to you... This means that you give them money, but you don't own anything.Until Amazon slashes the price and changes there EUL so that the books you buy are actually yours, I can only recommend that you stay far away from this device."
1,VERY HAPPY,"A relative showed me her Kindle and suggested I buy one as I am an avid reader and my book purchases were adding up. The local library never had the new books soon enough for me to read.My Kindle arrived and I put it to good use immediately. I have NO problem with the size and can read it anywhere. I like that it goes right to the page I left off so as not to lose where I was.One problem I have with Kindle is storing what I have read. I don't know what I am going to do with the build-up of books and as of now am deleting them from my devise to my account with Amazon.The second problem is not a real one but only that I keep trying to change the page like a book.The final problem is that my many friends must now go buy their own books to read as I shared my books and than donated to the local hospital and libray for people to read.Thanks,Jo Tavano"
3,WHAT:S WITH THE PRICE,When the Kindle 1 came out I thought the price of it was extremly high! I said I would wait for the next one surly it will be cheaper. Then the Kindle 2 came out and lord and behold the price did not go down and if you want a bigger one it's $100.00 more. I think amazon which usually is fair on it's prices could lower the price and not be so greedy. You can't even trade or barter with the books you download what am i going to do with the one's I brought for god sake. It's too bad seems like a great devise JUST LOWER THE PRICE ALL READY
1,Where can you go to try one out?,"Can't review this machine, because there's no information given on where to take a ""test drive"". Why would I buy something that I can't handle and experiment with beforehand?"
5,As good as duct tape,"This version's better than the first one, which I loved - but left on an airplane. It's right up there with sliced bread, duct tape, and canned beer, as far as ""advances in civilization"" are concerned."
5,Great,I enjoy the ease of using the Kindle. I just took it on a trip and it made taking reading material much lighter. Love it.
5,Love the Kindle,"I worried I would miss the whole book thing and this would quickly become a dust collector. I find the opposite is true. I love the kindle, it feels like a book especially if you get the cover. No more bookshelf space to worry about. Highly recommend."
2,Not as impressed as I had hoped,"I'm not happy with the glare and I am surprised the reviews I read didn't mention it. I plan on returning it and checking out the Sony e-reader. It has more flexibility and you can get books from everywhere - not just amazon.Good looking product, but the price tag and limited use of the product made me fall out of love pretty quick. I am shocked it has such a huge following - but - to each their own."
4,Amazon Kindle,I love my amazon kindle. I can fit it in my purse and take it anywhere with me. I love that I have my bible with me all of the time too. And not to mention the price of the books. Everything is wonderful about the Kindle. The only thing that I wish was that the E-Ink didnt leave a trace of the pages that you read once you turn the kindle off.
3,Lacks library access,"Everything about the Kindle is amazing, except the fact it's not library compatible. I'm an avid library reader and I realized I'm going to be spending a FORTUNE purchasing books to read. While the screen is slightly brighter than the Sony Reader, I ultimately ended up returning my Kindle and to get the Sony. And I've been EXCEPTIONALLY happy with the Reader. It's lighter weight and cost me $100 less, plus it came with a sleeve. Maybe if I travelled all the time, I would have issues having to connect and download books, but the process is very simple, working much like the itunes interface.Unless kindle goes epub/library compatible, I would never consider purchasing it again."
3,Beware of freezing-up,"I'm generally happy with my Kindle 2 (though I far prefer real books) but this device is handy for people like me that travel a lot and don't want to carry lots of books. That said, beware of problems with it freezing up! That happened to me recently on a 9-hour flight, leaving me without reading material. When I contacted Amazon, at first they told me that this could be caused by a low battery, but I had fully recharged my Kindle so that wasn't the problem. They told me that a Kindle could be rebooted by holding the power switch, but I had tried that and it didn't work either. When I eventually got to my hotel, I plugged it in and that eventually reset it but nonetheless, users should be wary of the fact that it can freeze up and if that happens somewhere like a long flight, then you may be out of luck for the duration of the flight."
5,Love it!,"My Kindle arrived while I was travelling and my daughter set it up for me; however, she said she basically just turned it on and it was good to go, so no real setup necessary. I haven't had to do anything complicated over the last few days, but for downloading and reading books as well as reading LiveJournal stories, it's been excellent. As an older reader, reading on my laptop or even certain books for hours is hard on my eyes -- the Kindle text is very soothing. And my daughter, who ridiculed my purchase upon learning I had ordered a Kindle, has decided this Kindle isn't leaving her home. She is an even more avid reader than I, owns tons of books, and loves the feel of books. But once she read a couple of books on the Kindle, she raved about how light it was, how easy the text is on her eyes, and just being able to order any book whenever she wants to read it."
1,Soon to be receiving my 3rd Kindle.,"Received my 1st Kindle for Christmas 2009. The screen went out in March 2010. To Amazon's credit they sent me another one immediately. The second one's screen is starting to go out now so I'll be sending it back for a replacement in May 2010. The Kindle idea is marvelous and I love being able to order a book right now. The electronics is junk, so I ordered the warranty at $65.00 for the second Kindle I received. I just hope my 3rd kindle holds up, but I'm not holding my breath."
2,Kindle in Canada,"I am disappointed in not getting many features in Canada, especially, all the free eBooks are NOT free from Amazon.You cannot simply send your files to your Kindle email address...so, you are stuck.Next page flow is kind of annoying to the eyes.Good technology, may be wait for the next gen."
1,Kindle and Europe/ What a joke,"I am an american living abroad. I bought a kindle and it does not work in europe.Can you believe that???We have iphones here, we have internet, electricity, running water.I cannot download books.There is also no information (that I can find) to tell me if the charger will take 210v as well as 110v.As of this moment I give the Kindle a negative Star.Lavada Nicholls"
3,Need more periodicals,"This product works as well as advertised except there are very few newspapers and magazines available for download. The text to voice is very robotic which makes for difficult listening. However, I bought it to read and it is very readable - even outside."
5,A new believer,"A Kindle was given to me as a gift by existing Kindle owners. At the time, I had just purchased an ereader from another source, and was able to compare them side by side. The end result? I took the ereader back. I have since not only purchased a Kindle for my husband, but recommended it to a number of others who expressed an interest.Why did I prefer the Kindle? Let me count the ways...- It was lighter- It was readable in any light- I LOVE the ability to access the internet and order books at any time- The light on the cover was much more convenient, and I would think sturdy- The price was lessI enjoy it more the longer I have it."
2,Considering Kindle,"Before buying this two questions1. Why can't I do all a Kindle can do on my existing laptop or pda? I can read newspapers, magazines etc. and other journals.2. If my laptop can do what a Kindle can do, then why can't the Kindle be designed to do all that a laptop can do? There are dropping prices on laptops approaching the price of the most expensive Kindle. But the laptop can do much more than merely read text. And isn't the Kindle text text that I have to buy to use it? Will the Kindle download and read free text that is available on the net?As this seems to be configured not to have both facilities, sounds like I'd have to lug along two readers, the Kindle and my laptop. Then there are the wires, battery chargers etc. for both.Won't it be just a matter of time before consolidating both facilties in one laptop will be the order of the day. And probably at much lesser price points?"
3,Some considerations before you buy.,"I waited until I owned the KIndle for almost a year before deciding to write a review - as a product is only as good as its first problem and how the company handles said problem.A big draw for me was books that were less expensive - now the Kindles prices on several new books has risen from $9.99 to $14 and change, this precedent disturbs me as I can go to the local store and buy it for a $1.00 more and have the copy to keep, lend to friends or donate to the local library as I wish.Next, my power adapter recently broke - the metal prong is missing. The power cord is only under warrenty for 30 days after purchase. There are no offers to replace it or free expidited shipping on your replacement order.Do I still love my Kindle? The answer is yes but only because I already own it and it is convienent for me to carry. I was fine with books and will be again when/if my Kindle has a major malfunction."
1,Not Ready for Overseas Purchase?,"after reading a few reviews I think I'll wait on purchase and see if something better comes along. I need a unit that can be used in Malaysia. There'd be no wireless service agreement in place as near as I can tell, so the added cost for the mobile chip goes to waste. It is also not clear whether Amazon supports all country regulatory and adapter requirements. Then there's the fact that the battery is not user replaceable -- if it costs $60 to freight this back to Amazon given US purchase then the cost for Asia will be prohibitive.If there are users in SE Asia who could tell me otherwise then please let me know, otherwise I'll wait for a better service level."
2,Tough reading at night,I have a Kindle2 and do a lot of my reading at night. This requires a night light. Even then it is difficult to attach a light to the Kindle and point it such that there isn't annoying glare. I understand that a back lit display enabling reading in a dark environment would chew up a lot of battery power. But it would be nice for the Amazon engineers to work on this. Please come up with a workable solution to night reading.Battery life is great -- when wireless is off.
1,Why the price??,"I have to say, I'm not a Kindle owner for one reason - the price. You can now buy a light weight very small laptop computer for the same price as a Kindle.I have a friend that owns the Kindle and I would love to purchase one but I can't justify the price.Amazon, drop your prices. You will make more money in the long run because I know there are more people out there like me that would love to buy this item but can't justify the expense."
5,Everything I wanted!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This was exactly what I had hoped it would be!!! I find it so much faster and easier to read books on the Kindle. I've had it for a little less than a week and have read two and a half books off of it. My friends are amazed by the eInk, and I love the fact that I can bookmark charts to come back to later. I love being able to say to myself ""I want this book. I can have it in less than five minutes!"" My only complaint is the whispernet service. It's a little slower than advertised, but I'm attributing that to the fact that I live in a smaller populated area. It still works in less than five minutes. Which I am really ok with. I can wait five minutes vs. driving all the way to a bookstore or ordering it online and waiting for it to come in the mail.Thanks, Amazon!!! I was apprehensive about buying one because of some things that I had read, but after just doing it, I'm so glad I did!!!!!!!!!"
4,kindle,"This product lives up to it's reviews. This is easy to read and navigate. The one shortcoming is that is too easy to accidently buy a book. The cursor always stops on Buy Now. For those of us with fast trigger fingers, we are buying things we do not want. There is a follow-up page that says did you accidently buy this book and you can get it removed. But it is instantly purchased and it takes a while for the credit to appear. Also if you miss the opt out page once purchased you have to CALL to get the book removed. This needs fixing....."
1,Kendle is much too fragile!!!,"I enjoy reading my Kindle 2, but it slipped off of my bedside table and is completely broken and unusable. Amazon refused to replace the item so I am out my $359.00 cost and the price of downloads.If an electronic item cannont withstand usual everyday use, it is certainly not worth the expensive price!!Buyer Beware!!!!"
1,restrictive policies - need to be opened up.,Amazon's policies need to be revised. I don't want corporate policy to determine which books I have access to.
4,Kindle,"Thank you for the opportunity to comment. I purchased my Kindle for somewhere around $371. Less than a month later the price is $259. I feel like a sucker. I complained to one of the staff (cannot remember his name)and he told me he would give me the same sale price ($259) and credit my account for the difference. That has not occured.When I received my first Kindle, it would not recharge. The complaint was handled expeditiously.The Kindle is great. Several of my office mates like it and said they would order one soon. The leather cover is also excellent.Thank you,Howard Hensley, Esquire"
4,Interesting product,"Interesting product for reading books. The layout can be improved for ""papers"". Hope for more titles available in Europe."
1,why haven't they done this already?,"Wonder why they haven't made an reader that opens up just like a book? Would feel more familiar, and you get to read two pages at once, JUST LIKE A BOOK.You'd think that would have been how they introduced this product, easier transition.When somebody figures this out, I'll buy it!"
3,LOUD page turning and lots of it!,"All the wonderful things about the Kindle 2 are well documented, but my husband and I are having a problem with the VERY LOUD sticky page-turning button. I understand the K1 was too easy to turn, but this is very noisy. We both read in bed, but are on slightly different schedules, and the loud constant clicking keeps the other spouse awake, or else the reading spouse is so distracted from reading due to focusing on how to minimize the noise.The tiny amount of content on each page (tiny screen, huge keyboard space) contributes to the problem. We are fast readers and are constantly clicking. Great for airplane reading with constant background noise, but not good for a marriage!"
2,"Periodicals are the heart of Kindle distribution, not books!","If the Kindle cannot do Newspapers (With Advertising!) - to pay the writers - then it is worthless. The wireless download handles the newspapers distribution problem just fine. (You need to allow the customer to throw away the parts of the newspaper that s/he doesn't read to minimise the download costs) And you need to allow the newspaper/periodical customer to specify what kind of ad-space that the customer considers of most value, so that the advertiser will get good value for their advertising dollar.Amazon.com has no darned newspapers or magazines because they have set up a newspaper and magazine distribution system that does not respect the organization's economic needs.I can buy a Kindel with the distribution cost savings for a newspaper or magazine. That pays for the Kindle.The newspaper are ""taters'""in the sale of a Kindel. The books are ""gravy"" for the customer - but not for Amazon.com or the publishers.David L. Wilson"
2,Way too Expensive,"I am interested in the concept of the Kindle, but it is way tooo expensive a device for my reading needs. I read on average about three books a month, along with newspapers and magazines. I do most of my reading on mass transportation, whether waiting or riding. I suppose I will continue borrowing and buying paper reading material."
2,Whispernet Service needs work,"I've owned my Kindle exactly a week. The product is fine. I've read one book on it. My problem is the inability of my downloads to come to the kindle. I've ordered three products (two book previews and one full book) in the past twelve hours and NONE of them have appeared on my Kindle....although my credit card was charged for the one book. Amazon hasn't been responsive to my emails either. The Kindle might be going back to the ""Kindle Store."""
4,My new Kindle,"I'm enjoying it so far. The books are easy to read, but the audio part sucks. It moves pretty slow too when I'm trying to make a highlight, don't like that. I think the menu's could be a little more user friendly, I had a hard time finding the mp3 player option. I do like the cheaper books and the variety. I also figured out that connecting it to my PC is much easier to read all my bookmarks and highlights than through the device itself. Over-all, very happy. (Although I wish it had come with a free case. (it's already dinged up)"
4,Great little beginner package.,"I bought this item for the reason of reading books, not searching the internet. It does have internet capability, but it's very slow and difficult to navigate. Incredibly impressed with it's footnote and reading capabilities. Not good for reviewing diagrams or spreadsheets. Wish it had a better system for storing ebooks on the Kindle because they are just bulked up in one location and you have to wade through the listing to find the book you want. The price was right for the technology and portibility. Remember it's not backlit, so you'll need a book light or other lighting to read. It also works great in direct sunlight, it's very clear and totally legible. I'm glad I bought it, but may consider an ipad in the future, but this Kindle give me a good taste for the ebook experience."
3,Useless for references,"Kindle 2 is handsome and easy to use for linear reading. The controls are intuitive and user friendly.But for reading reference works, including the Bible, it is useless since the texts lack linkage. Meaning, in the Bible, that to read, say, something from Mark, you need to start from Genesis and page through.Alternately, you can search on some key word you know is in Mark, go to it, find the beginning of the book by paging through, and then create a bookmark. Which, of course, won't be labeled, except with a useless number.Oh, of course, one may add a text note. Then, if you're truly dedicated, repeat for each and every book of the Bible.The net result? The best technology that 1985 can offer. It's hardly a product of 2009. Stated differently: the hardware is up to date; the software at least 25 years old."
5,I LOVE MY KINDLE!!!!!,"I purchased my Kindle 2 about 18 months ago. I was having trouble seeing and was not able to read even the large print books any longer. I truly missed being able to lose myself in a good book. My Kindle 2 gave me back the ability to read again because I can enlarge the font. It is also so easy to download a new book. One of the best features is the fact that even though I enlarge the font, the printed page redistributes itself so that it looks just like it was written that way. I have traveled a few times with my Kindle and I always get questions about it. I still have a lot of trouble seeing and probably always will but with my Kindle I know I will still be able to read, read, read! Thank you for creating this great reading tool. I LOVE MY KINDLE!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Kindle 2,"I've got to say, I waited over a year before purchasing the Kindle due mainly to the price, but finally decided to go for it. I'm very very pleased that I bought the Kindle 2. It's extremely easy to use and buying the books is a breeze. The pictures of the books on the kindle store using the Kindle are too small for me to see, so I sort through them on my computer then make a list of what I want and order them with the Kindle2, but that is my only issue with this book reader.This product is great for me at work, home, traveling, etc. It's so light that my backpack now weighs nothing at all. My only fear is dropping it on the granite floor at work, so I'm very careful with it and so I purchased the 2 year warranty.I just may be buying a second one this Christmas for my husband who reads as much if not more then I do.Thanks so much for creating this great product."
3,Kindle 2,"Kindle Wireless Reading Device (6"" Display, Global Wireless, Latest Generation)I have had my Kindle for over a year. Because the Amazon video showed the Kindle dropped and not suffering any damage, I did not purchase an extended warranty. Well, it fell from a very short height and now the corner of the screen does not display. I did have a cover on it, which absorbed part of the impact. After checking online, I discovered this has happened over and over again and Amazon has never addressed it. I feel the video is a gross misrepresentation and has marred my previously high regard for Amazon. If I had known about the damage that even a minor fall could do, I would NOT have purchased the Kindle. It was a stretch of my resources to purchase it and I could not have afforded the added price of a warranty."
3,Kindle 2 vs kindle 1,"Where is the sd card? Why does the kindle 2 not have access to the battery? Great product, but the kindle 3 needs to have the above!"
3,kindle without free wi-fi,"I bought the Kindle as a gift for my husband. He ultimately returned it due to the Kindle not having free wi-fi. We bought the nook instead as it has free wi-fi from AT&T. Would have kept the Kindle except that one minor glitch. We loved the key board directly on the Kindle front. Also, B&N has a better book selection."
4,Two words - hypen-ation,"I love everything about it except the lousy formatting - how could Amazon be so dumb as to release a product designed specifically for reading where the text is by default fully justified without providing hyphenation?Other than that it's brilliant. The first 30 minutes or so it felt awkward, but now I get lost in books on my Kindle just the way I do with real books.And for anyone thinking ""I can read ebooks on my iPhone or laptop"" you don't know what you're talking about until you try reading on an eInk screen. It's just like reading from paper."
3,It lacks sufficient userr-friendly features,"I am unable to insert the name of the book I am looking for inside a field, rather I am obliged to type its whole name in the search field. In addition, you changed the keyboard and letters are hard to find.Not all the books I read on Amazon reviews or The New Times reviews are on Kindle. This is frustrating. I recently had to order 2 hardcover books through regular snail mail. They were newish editions.Thee main screen activities are hard to figure out, even though your user's manual looks so easy to implement, and I commend you on that.I also want to comment on the Kindle 29.99 Kindle case made of vynl, it needs a strap to wrap around your wrist and also a pocket to keep papers, and some inside pocket to store its cable. It disapointed me grately."
2,2 months then screen broke,"I have had the Kindle 2 for 2 months. I am not rough with it, but I pulled it out this week to use it and lo and behold, the screen was busted. Not on the outside, but on the inside, where it resembles a child's etch-a-sketch.Called customer service. They said the Kindle must have been exposed to some sort of physical pressure. I replied that it had not. They offered to replace for a cost to me of $200.I am frustrated, because I took great pains to take care of this device, it was not a cheap investment, and now I am left with a broken, non-functioning device. If I was rough on it I would understand their position, but I was not."
5,Perfect for me.,"I read a lot. I love reading. I always have a book in my purse for waiting in lines or waiting for an appointment, now I have my Kindle. I had been wanting a Kindle but had balked at getting one because of the price, but after our last move and packing up all of our books, and giving many away I was more open to the idea. I was still hesitant after I saw the Kindle 2 because of price. I kept talking about it and reading reviews, especially the negative ones. All I want my Kindle for is to read books. Not technical books, or text books. I am amazed at how easy the E Ink is on the eyes, the slight shadowing from page to page does not bother me. I would like to see a folder option and some slight adjustments to the controls but nothing major. I hope the books available for the Kindle expands I have looked for some but they have not been available. I love all the free books, especially the classics. I am a very happy customer."
3,Kindle review,"I was quite happy when I bought kindle. The only problem that it broke in 3 months, without any external impact."
4,"Evolution, not revolution","I owned a Kindle 1 and took the leap of faith to upgrade to Kindle 2. It has the improved features you've read about (smaller size, slightly faster page flips, harder to accidentally page flip) but the major improvement for me over the Kindle 1 is that when reading a newspaper or magazine, you can skip ahead to the next article with one button push once you've started reading an article rather than hitting ""Next Page"" multiple times. Believe me when I say, this was more than a minor annoyance and worth the money I spent on a second device.Having said that, if you read Kindle for books rather than periodicals, a used Kindle 1 will probably satisfy all your needs and save you a few dollars. I live in NYC and never learned to do the origami fold required to read the paper on the train; the Kindle obviates that need.Very curious what the next innovation in Kindle will be, and when. In the meantime, very happy with Kindle 2."
4,kindle2,"I have had my kindle 2 for about three weeks. The first 2 weeks it couldn't be pried out of my hands. It went everywhere with me. Now the newness is wearing off and it is still going most places with me. The compact design lets it fit in a purse or briefcase easily. I'm am not a gadget person and was very pleased at how easy it is to navigate through a kindle. So far I love everything about it other than the keyboard its so tiny. Way to go Jeff What a great product. Love it, Love it, Love it!"
3,Pretty Good Device,"I have had my Kindle 2 for a couple of weeks now, and I do use it every day. It is useful but not perfect. I could wish that the contrast between text and background were better -- the background is a little too gray for easy reading in moderate light. But most of all, I wish that there were a ""next page"" button near the top of the device on the left-hand side. If you read, as I do, with your left hand holding the Kindle in its book-style case from the top, it is a very big stretch of the thumb to reach the button. I can't imagine I'm the only person who holds it this way when reading in a chair or in bed -- I would have thought that a second generation device would have been engineered for the way people use it. If you take it out of the case to use it it is easy to hold it and control it from the side, but then why have a book-style case?"
2,Some things missing...but still hoping,"I was so pleased to see that the Kindle would be available outside the US. All those benefits (almost instant gratification/downloads, a single device for all your books, electronic ink, rather than a glary screen, etc). Wonderful.That said, I won't be buying the Kindle just yet. I was hoping the international launch would include a larger screen size (like the DX). And the absence of colour and the significantly higher ticket price on a DX also grate. But here's hoping these three things will fall in line in the near future, so I can buy into Kindle..."
3,mixed review,I must say I enjoy my (old model) very much. There are two things which make it less than wonderful: 1)although I have had my Kindle for two years whispernet has not expanded to cover the area where I live so I have to download from my computer which is time consuming; 2)unless the cover has improved in design it is almost worthless except for storage.I love the convenience of size and weight for reading in bed especially. Some of the books have typos and paragraphs and sentences look strange. I read a couple of weeks on my Kindle every week. I am glad I have it.Anne Morgan
4,Kindle is to books as ipod is to albums,"Like many, I love my books and the bicep workout I get from holding a new hardback for hours...those days may be coming to an end. I'm loving my new Kindle and it does everything as promised. Type can be any size, I can highlight passages and make notes on a page (and I can even printout all those notes and highlights!) It knows right where I stopped and my favorite feature...putting the mouse over any word to get an instant defintition...my hardback book can't do that!Kindle has shortcomings. For one...I can't read a book in the dark or my Kindle. A backlit screen would be amazing, but I'm sure adds weight and price to the unit. Also, like a book, I must read in black & white and with only limited picture/graphic capabilities.Future Kindles will surely have full color, pictures and lighting, but for now, I don't plan to buy any more books that I can't get on my Kindle."
3,English only,"Overall very good product, very fast shipping.I'm from Spain and I think it could disturb tarduccir menus, not a big problem.The biggest concern is buying ebook in Spanish, there are really few and buy in Spain is very expensive."
2,"wonderful device, until...","The Kindle was everything that I had hoped that it would be, until it began to malfunction. Despite a full battery, every few minutes the Kindle would suddenly return to the main menu while I was trying to read a book. Worse, occasionally it would completely reset, coming back up with a blank menu that slowly repopulated; it was more than a minute from when the device reset until I could see my books again. When I returned to my book I would find that it had lost my place and I would have to go searching, page after page, to pick up where I had left off. It so completely broke the book-like experience that I had to return it. I would give it 1 Star if not for the truly delightful few days before its malfunction. Perhaps the next-gen one will more stable."
5,Made a Convert out of me!,"I am an old fashioned book reader and never thought that I would enjoy reading a book other than with the bound paper in my hands. The Kindle 2 has converted me to electronic reading. Most books are eminently readable in the Kindle format. There are still some shortcomings with books that have large charts and tables or lots of pictures, but for 99% of what I read the Kindle 2 is fantastic. The convenience of getting my hands on a book instantly as well as being able to carry multiple books on long trips without the weight and bulk of ordinary books is enough to justify the purchase in and of itself. The light weight and ability to handle with one hand make using a Kindle more comfortable than a regular book in many situations."
3,"Kindle OK, just not for me",The Kindle worked fine for me and I had no problems getting content to the unit. I had it for a few weeks but did resell it as I wear glasses and really did not read it enough. One thing I wish s that I did not have to pay to read Blogs.... I can get those all free on the computer or even my iPhone. The books were a good deal and the newspapers were decent (but still seemed a bit pricey) If they would make the larger DX a bit cheaper I would prob. purchase and try that one out.
5,My Kindle,"I love this product however, I experienced screen freezing within a few days of owning my Kindle. In addition I do not like the fact that if I decide to return my Kindle it will be replaced with a refurbished Kindle. This is what I was told by an Amazon customer service tech when inquiring about my Kindle freezing. A refurbished Kindle I see on Amazon.com is selling for $159 where as I paid $259.00 for a new Kindle. I believe that a customer that paid full price for the Kindle should not have to accept a refurbished product when experiencing manufactured technical difficulties now that, I totally disagree with. So unless I continue to experience screen freezing I think I will just keep my NEW Kindle vs. having it replaced with a refurbished one. But over all I really enjoy my kindle!!!!!"
4,Kindle,"Bought the basic Kindle.Very good.Instant books-one or two minute download, even in rural Far East where I residewhere it is difficult to find good selection of books without paying through the nose for postageand having to wait.Finding required books on Kindle Store is slow.Not for the impatient.A quicker method is to go to Amazon site on PC and look forbooks with Kindle download. Much quicker.Then use Kindle to download.Disappointed that all books offered on Amazon are not available on Kindle.However, still a wide choice and many classics available for a few dollarswith freebies as well and found new authors suited to my taste.Reading much more.Can increase print size to suit.Dictionary system also good-instant look-up simply by placing cursor next to word in textto get explanation while reading.Instant gratification is heady stuff and hard to find.I charge mine from my PC USB port.If you are dithering, just buy it-the basic model has been reduced to $US139."
4,"Kindle 6"" display","I like my Kindle; but it does have shortcomings when compared to new entries into the e-reader fray. It now seems utilitarian when seeing the more ""fun"" and colorful Apple and Nook readers. Particularly the book covers and the page turning features. Kindle will be wise to add more robust features quickly."
2,"When the battery works its ok, only the battery is not long lived",I like the kindle when the battery deems it will turn on. Maybe I just got a lemon. I had to return the kindle because the battery died. It wasnt easy to get a a replacement though. I reached an out source complaint department and found it difficult to say the least to explain that the batter died. She went through a long process reading from a manual trying all kinds of possible resolutions until she finally accepted the battery was not charging. A replacement was sent and I thought things were OK. But 6 months latter guess what the battery will not charge!!!! Now what do I now ? I am not sure they will do anything about it and I am not sure I want to go through the process. Maybe you will have better luck. I seem to have drawn the lemon. I have googled and found I am not the only one who has suffered this fate. In short I hope you have better luck. The battery Longevity really s___ks.
5,KINDLE IS GREAT NEW DEVICE,"The new Kindle has been a great surprise in how easy it is to work and purchase new books...effortless, yet the e mail sent each time keeps one informed of what and how much, one has purchased."
4,Very satisfied. .,My wife was delighted with the gift of a Kindle for her birthday. Would highly recommend this product.
4,Good but with some limitations,"Kindle is a good product and is perfect for your eyes - the battery lasts a lot, you can read for hours without feeling tired...However, when it comes to buying books from other sources than Amazon and supported file formats.... good look!I have just bought a PDF e-book from a another store - the book is of course encrypted with DRM and.. surprise, I can only view this file on my computer and not on Kindle!This is a serious limitation that I was unaware of.. so be careful what e-books you are buying cause transferring them on Kindle may be impossible or an ordeal..."
3,Okay,"Good for reading a novel The most frustrating thing is not being able to go back and quickly find a specific page. ""Locations"" are not page numbers and it's difficult to guess what ""location"" corresponds to a page. This would seriously hamper its use for study purposes. I know you can bookmark and all that, but sometimes you don't anticipate what you may want to refer to later.The text to voice is also very robotic and with no expression it's hard for me to listen to.With the cover on it, it's really heavier than toting around a book."
1,Used Kindle Wireless Reading Device,"The used Kindle wireless reading device I ordered from Amizon was mailed by the owner. It arrived within the stated time. However, the previous owner did not pack the product properly and, as a result, it arrived in a broken and defective condition. I have tried to contact Amizon and the company that Amizon's web site referred me to. Neither has contacted me back or done anything to alleviate the problem. It has been a very frustrating experience."
5,A reader's delight,"My Kindle 2 arrived about two weeks ago, and it is fabulous. It does everything that the promo materials said it would do. It is thin and lightweight and easy to carry. The downloading is quite fast and easy. As with everything, there are a couple of things that I would like added. For me it would be helpful to have a clock at the top of every page, because I'm often reading with limited time. I hope that more magazines and newspapers do Kindle versions, because the ones I read aren't yet available. It does not come with a case, which it should frankly, so you will definitely need to order one, because you won't want to carry it around without one. The biggest problem that its users will face is not spending a fortune on books, because it makes it so quick and easy to get one. Every time I am reading on it out somewhere in public, people want to know what it is, so be prepared to demonstrate it. It is a wonderful product."
1,Has a big weakness!!!,"The kindle seems great at the beggining, but is a money pit. There's a huge weakness. You can't rent ebooks from your local library. If you're local library doesn't have a good selection of ebooks go for it. Otherwise I do not recommend this product."
5,Love that Kindle!!,This is a wonderful way to read a book. I really like my Kindle & take it with me everywhere.
5,How Did I Ever Live Without a Kindle?,"Love the portability of having a newspaper, magazine or book all in one convenient Kindle - plus we're saving trees! Slim and lightweight! I carry my Kindle everywhere I go which encourages me to read the articles and the books that I have downloaded. I wish that the Kindle displayed the time of day - but other than that it is worth more than what I paid."
3,It wasnt predictable,"This book helps restore faith in ""goodness"", while showing that things arent always as great as you want."
2,Eh...,"There was something about this film that didn't quite work. I smiled a few times but never really laughed out loud as I had expected. Not sure what went wrong here. Not even Jay and Silent Bob could make the film funny. And the donkey shtick was stupid, not funny. The whole thing felt labored to me. I don't know, just didn't have the goods. Oh well. I am in love with Rosario Dawson, however."
2,Good Picture Quality But Not Funny,I have to say the quality of the movie as far as picture and sound is just about perfect. I however didnt laugh at all during the whole movie. It is predictable and full of stupid characters. I guess its for fans only.
5,"Different movie, same great characters","All fans of the first film should see Clerks 2. Not only is it really funny, but it's about people just a little older than me who haven't really done anything with their lives, and what they finally choose to do. There is also a donkey show, and everybody loves those! Some thought this might not match up to the first movie, but it truly is the logical extension of the characters' lives. Despite the comedy, Clerks 2 makes me a little sad because it reminds me of my own problems. The picture quality is very nice, even with the strange color filters, and the special features - entirely in HD - are incredible. Keep on clerkin'."
2,Like but unhappy,I purched a 24-inch Leaf rake in the past but it broke in two pieces. I ordered a replacement which arrived today and it said it is unbreakable. What is your replacement policy. The first rake was also purchased from Amazon.com
1,Broke in less than 10 minutes...,I was shocked and upset after thinking that I had just found the holy grail of leaf rakes. Within 10 minutes it split in the middle. Within 20 minutes it had lost 2 teeth. And the worst part? I wasn't being hard on it at all! Just raking up slightly damp leaves and not even a ton of them. What a P-O-S! Never again!!!
3,love Fiskars but...,I have come to trust the Fiskars brand for its quality and design. This is an expensive rake so imagine my disappointment when the plastic rake broke in half in the first 10 minutes of dry leaf raking. Fiskars sent me a replacement for free and that one is working fine.
2,fine till it broke,"I liked this product fine till it broke. After that, not so much. It's really annoying trying to gather leaves with a busted rake.Of course it is not unusual for a rake to give out after just a couple seasons--especially when its user is as massively strong as I am--but I was hoping for better. The plastic span, above the tines, developed a crack one day. Duct tape kept it going another few weeks but of course the crack grew with use and today it just snapped in two.I've generally liked Fiskars products in the past, but seems like they reached a little past their engineers' abilities with this one."
2,Worked well until it broke,"No better than any other rake. It worked well for a little while but this weekend the plastic shoulder broke while moving a small pile of acorns. I wasn't subjecting it to harder than reasonable conditions. Very disappointed, will just buy a cheapie at the local hardware store to replace it."
1,Bait & Switch,"Ditto for the other reviewers. It's bait and switch, as the product I received is nothing like the description, nor the instructions which are inside for a large batch composter."
2,Doesn't flow,"The first couple pages have a great rhythm that encourage an energetic reading but by the halfway point you'll be stumbling over the words. The final page, a recap of all animals featured, is a very tedious read. This is the book that taught me to read board books all the way through, aloud, before buying.The art is very pretty though."
3,Sorta Weird,"My 2-year old twins like this book because they like to see the animals, but I think they'd get more out of it if more mainstream animals were used. I think they're a little thrown by animals like ""macaroni penguin"" - sounds like food to them. The dreaming child part is weird looking too.I think it's great to use endangered animals, although my kids aren't exactly as concerned about animal endangerment as I am. It's not a bad book or anything, but honestly, if I had read it in a bookstore, I wouldn't have bought it."
1,Not one of these titles is a John Wayne Film.,"There are numerous John Wayne collections that are using bogus titles that make you think you are missing some of John Wayne's films from your collection. Be advised, these titles (An Innocent Man, Cold Vengeance, Gold Strike River, Guns Along the Trail, Stagecoach Run, Stolen Goods) ARE NOT TITLES OF JOHN WAYNE MOVIES! Check the internet movie data base (IMDB.com).Some people have noted that these are colorized versions of other film titles, if that's the case, why the dishonesty?"
2,High expectations crushed by this cheap product,"I like the concept but the product has its flaws. Spork and knife that come with product are cheap plastic that will break the first time you pick up a radish or tomato. The lid is difficult to open. I don't know if it's too heavy because of the ice pack but I've struggled a couple of times with getting it opened. The salad dispenser dial WILL NOT BUDGE. I have to manually open the dressing lid and pour over the salad. For the price I paid for it, this product is a great disappointment."
4,This is a great product!!!,I fix a nice fresh salad and bring it to work OR leave it in the frig for a nice end to a beautiful meal. It is ideal!
2,Overrated.,"**Update**I've now completely stopped using it. The novelty has worn off and attempting to squish it into my backpack with all of my books or carry it in another bag wasn't worth it. This is really disappointing because I don't actually believe that most people take a salad as big as the container to work/school. It's unnecessarily large.Also, a couple of times the dressing holder didn't keep in place and I opened it up to find a soggy salad - defeating its very purpose.**Old Review**This is a good little salad shaker. It's hard to find a container that has a separate spot for salad dressing!The cold pack works well but as a whole the container is bulky."
2,"Great in theory, not in practice","An excellent idea- all in one for your salad and dressing!However, if one uses oil based dressing, it's hard to clean out of the cup. You must handwash, which is a no for me.I also was never able to put the knife and fork back in the top of the container once I took them out.The ice does keep lettuce cool on a warm (not hot!) day."
2,"Great idea, but it doesn't work","I absolutely love the idea of this product, but as others have mentioned, it just doesn't work. Specifically, the dressing container just cannot be twisted into position. I've tried putting a little oil on the threads, but it's still too tight. A great idea, but it's just way too difficult to actually use."
2,StarCraft Movie Special,This is literally all the cut-scenes of the game. I guess I expected it would be higher resolution though - but it's the same old blocky looking video...
4,Good product,"The brace is firm but just flexibility enough to be comfortable. Because the strap can't be removed from the loop, it is a little tight to slip on, which is annoying. Otherwise, once it is on, I can wear all day without discomfort."
1,ahh nostalgia,"I HAVE A LONGING TO BE Back in the 1980's,and this seller placed me there squarely with this cd.i am in the process of making my 80's cd library complete,and i hope that htis seller and amazon can assist me with their wonderful selections..."
4,Great film,"This is a great film to watch the wonders of nature that God has created for us. It is informative as well as inspiring. I would recommend it, especially for kids and young adults."
5,God of Wonders DVD,This is an absolutely amazing dvd! Great for kids and adults. We were glued to our seats watching this. Very much showcases the beauty of nature by our amazing God!
3,not right product,did not receive the bear in the picture I received an all pink bear that says my baby bear my daughter is happy with the bear that we received but i was disapointed that we did not receive the right bear. shipping was very quick.
2,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,I was dissapointed because the description clearly states CORDLESS and the phone is not cordless.
3,This is okay,"I bought this for our 4 yr old daughter. She loved it at first, but relized it is attached to the wall and she cant go anywhere when she is talking. We have it for about a month and already the ear peice and base are missing."
4,CORDLESS OR NOT?,"Well, some people say it is cordlessand some don't. The company said itwas cordless but somereviewers said it was not cordless.SO, IS IT CORDLESS OR NOT?I don't have this phone but I wouldrather buy it knowing it if it was cordless."
1,Bad Experience,The item offered is listed as a 4-pk. I only received one part. After complaining to Amazon I was told that it was not Amazon's problem and that I would have to deal with the supplier. The supplier informed that they have previously notified Amazon of the description error but they failed to correct it. I just checked the Amazon web site and the 4-pk is STILL offered so I am sure that other customers will be victims like me and suffer. The vendor that shipped the part was nice enough to fully refund me but I blame Amazon for negligence regarding this problem. I hope that they will eventually correct their catalog offering.I doubt that I will shop with Amazon again.
5,Smells Like Heaven,"I have used this product since 2005. I was on a cruise ship and the spa used Elemis products, exclusively. I had the full treatment and I never felt so good. That hooked me and I buy it all the time now. I use is mostly as a moisturizer after my shower. I've used it in the shower as well, but really like that beautiful lotion on after I shower. Give it a try....it's a little pricey but it is worth it."
1,Poor Quality,I recieved this toy as a baby shower gift. I thought it was a great idea however it turned out to be very flimsy. The toys are supposed to stay attached with velcro but they never stayed on. The bar doesn't hold in place very well either. I wouldn't recommend it.
4,Lots of fun packed into this set,"There is a good variey of old school sci-fi in this set. While the best of the bunch production-wise is Dr. Cyclops (awesome flick!), most of the others are of the lower b-grade drive-in variety. Yes, they are bad movies, but the best kind of bad movies. The Deadly Mantis is tons of fun and The Land Unknown was surprisingly hilarious, with the guy lumbering around in the rubber t-rex costume being the highlight of the show! If you are the kind of person who can appreciate this kind of stuff then this set is gonna be well worth the money. I bought my copy used on Amazon and it came in near mint condition at a great price. Two Thumbs Up!"
3,Good Collection,"Ok, these flicks are not up to the level of EARTH VERSUS THE FLYING SAUCERS or THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL (or THEM!, for that matter), but it's a fun collection of Grade B and Below features that will entertain any sci-fi/horror buff. I bought the collection for primarily to own THE LEECH WOMAN, with Colleen Gray and Grant Williams, but it's good to have a copy of the occasionally weird DR. CYCLOPS on hand also. The pictures are very crisp, but it would have been nice to have a few extra added attractions."
5,THE BEST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED,"This is clearly the best game i have ever played, in my entire life.After the getaway, i tried hitman 2 and gta vice city etc (they all fall terribly short from the getaway).When you play the getaway, you think you are in the game... there are no stupid colorful buttons, writing or flashing things showing how many lives you have left etc on the screen (they have smarter more subtle ways of communicating this information within the game).You become apart of it. Played it over and over again.I can't wait for the second version (and they better make more)."
2,Over-rated!,"This game just isn't that good! You don't have very much control over the cars while driving, there are no maps, no ammo count, very limited type of guns and cars, and the game itself moves pretty slow. They make you do the same things over and over, so much that it's not even fun anymore by the time you finish that mission. And the guy huffs and puffs so loudly while you are playing, it sounds like a cheesy porno! The graphic do rock and the soundtrach is decent, but that doesn't make up for how lame the game actually is. Save your money and just keep on playing Vice City or Max Payne."
3,Better than GTA Vice city?...,"I will give this game credit for the real graphics and usage of actual cars with good turning capabilities and speed.BUT: You cant look behind you or to the side of you in your car, nor shoot out of it. you can only carry your handguns, and one other weapon, no map, turn signals can be confusing and if you hit your taillights, your screwed for directions, this is a game i would rent, NOT BUY!!!!! It has way to many opportunities to be better, go with Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, GTA should have a hundred more additions!!! I love GTA!! Loved it since the birdeye view from playstation 1 all the way!!!"
2,Could have been great - but this book sucks,This book has incredible potential. This could have been a great book. But unfortunately this book really sucks. The author only gives partial explanations while he is deriving formulas. There is not enough information given to follow and learn the subject matter while following his derivations. This book should only be used by people who know how to derive all the equations. So if you don't know the material before purchasing this book then don't waste your money.
1,Poorly written!,"The ""advanced"" never surfaced in this book. It is an insult to the reader to wade through this muck. With the massive number of spelling errors and incorrect words on almost every page, I assume Neil Carlson could not even get his own family to proof read the book for him.If you are a sales professional looking for ""advanced"" techniques you will find nothing new here. If you are new to sales, there are hundreds of books on the market that cover all of this and more. I would suggest starting with ""Smart Salespeople Sometimes wear Plaid"" which is a classic."
5,"A justifiably classic ""Classic.""",Chang has done something really important and necessary in writing this concise and comprehensible overview of Hwa-Yen philosophy. I'd recommend this to any student who wishes to cultivate a deeper understanding of the Avatamsaka Sutra and the elements of Mahayana thought that culminates in Hwa-Yen.
2,Roboreptile is Overpriced,"My son got his long awaited roboreptile and was disappointed by it. It can't even walk on carpet and barely can move forward even on a hard floor. It has 3 layers (sets) of commands but it doesn't seem to do much more than just one set of commands. Last, for the money, the robopet is much more fun to play with, costs less, and can move easily on any floor type."
5,Great Toy,My son got this for Christmas and loves it! It looks like a little dog. We took it to several relatives homes this week and they all thought it was so neat. We almost didn't get it because of some of the negative reviews. We think it is great. My son loves it!
3,Good enough...,"Roboreptile isn't what they showed in the comercial at all!! It can't walk straight and it need really really really really really really really good batteries!!!!!But other than that... it's great!! Just so you know it takes 9 AA batteries.Honestly it wasn't what I expected. It has a hard time walking on 2 legs. Only buy this if you have a really, really amazing battery, otherwise it's crap!!! Nothing but crap!! Think about it long and hard if you're planning to buy Roboreptile. Roboreptile is a big improvement from Roboraptor!! I suggest you buy Robosapian V2 or Robosapian V3. They're a whole lot better. I'm planning to get Robosapian V2. SO REMEMBER: THINK ABOUT GETTING ROBOREPTILE LONG AND HARD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Great Toy!!!- A Kid's Review,I just got this toy for Christmas and it is AWESOME!!! It can hunt and track and perform many actions. For example: It can run on its hind legs or react with the environment. I have had it for two days now and I'm still learning new things about it. It is a great toy to have.
3,Mediocre,"This film wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great. I only watched it because I'm interested in the history, but I'm not sure that was very accurate either."
2,too gruesome,Gruesome subject matter. Not my kind of movie. I don't know why I kept watching. Don'waste your time on this one.
3,It's okay,It was okay. Myself I won't be buying the dvd. Just wasn't that good of a show. Thanks for letting me talk.
3,The Protector Blu-Ray (you can't have one without the other),"The difference between the Blu-Ray ""ultimate edition"" and the 2-disc DVD ""ultimate edition"" is that the DVD has the special feature that shows the 5 different takes they needed on the one-long-take fight scene. The Blu-Ray, for some reason, omits this feature, so you have to make a choice: either buy the DVD and be disappointed that it's not Blu-Ray, or buy the Blu-Ray and be disappointed it doesn't have the special feature, or buy none of them and be disappointed in the company (the Weinstein one) who released it."
2,bad editing job,"This movie was a headache to watch. The sequences throughout the film aren't really smooth and consistent. I found myself saying ""hey, wait a minute"". I thought that maybe I wasn't paying attention to the movie but then quickly figured out that it was the ""style"" of the film.Plus, as a Deaf person, I found myself having to switch back and forth with the subtitles and captions. Some scenes are spoken in Thai, which are subtitled. However, once English is spoken, I had to switch to captions. Usually, the captions or subtitles will take care of everything...not this film.Anyways, this movie is about avenging the theft of royal elephants (and the death of one), which were raised for the king's service. So, Kham is sent to Australia to return the elephants. Simple plot.What I loved about this movie was the fight scenes. I found myself grimacing as I saw these scenes. I don't think I've ever seen one man fight against so many people...not even with Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan."
2,Too many special effects,"Poor story line and acting but I'm not complaining about that. This is an action movie and it delivers the fight sceens...sort of. I expected hard hitting action like I saw in Ong Bak.This movie had a bigger budget and they moved away from the format that made Ong Bak great. It's less gritty and they tried to make it look like it was produced in Hollywood but they failed. Instead of looking slick it seems overdone. I mean really, cgi? It made the action cheesy.They ruined the fight scenes which is the only reason to see the movie."
2,Spastic.,"This is by far one of the most spastic movies I have ever seen. It is kind of like those annoying stylized action flicks, but without the stylin' gimmicks; it is just bafflingly without transitions. It is fast paced and silly. Silly without being funny. But there are a couple amusing foes here and there."
4,Vintage phone,I bought this phone simply to have a phone with a cord. It looks really neat on the wall and has a very cool retro ring. The sound quality is not great as it echos but I was aware of quality issues before purchasing. It feels like a substantial phone and I have gotten several compliments on it. Shipped as promised by vendor.
2,so-so,The phone looks great on the wall but it I have trouble hearing callers. The volume only adjusts the ringer not the speaker. Not sure if it's a defect or just a problem. Could someone respond to that?
5,A+ Great Old-fashioned looking phone,I love this phone. It looks great in my kitchen. It is heavy and sturdy with a super long cord. It has the rotary phone look but it's touch tone. I also love the old ringer. It is a conversation piece for everyone. The delivery was super fast and it's definitely worth the price. Very good quality phone.
3,Crosley Red Wall Phone,"love the color. More cranberry than red. If you're not using your hands to hold the phone, it's hard to balance the handset between your shoulder and ear. if you are use to push button phones, it takes a while to find the number locations. sound seems to waver, but it could be me trying to keep the phone balanced between my ear and shoulder. overall, i'm happy with it."
2,This phone has problems - Beware,"This phone (Crosley 302 wall phone) has poor sound quality. I frequently have to switch to another extension to hear or to be understood by others. It also causes a nasty interference on all of the extensions in the house. This drawback alone makes the phone largely unusable. Be aware that the cord is permanently attached to the receiver (not a modular connection). Do not order a extended cord, because you can't attach it. The third problem is that the receiver doesn't always disconnect the call when you hang up. The receiver will seem to be hung up correctly, but the line is still open. This is an attractive, heavy-duty phone, but it about to go into my telephone graveyard."
1,Poor product,"After nine months of using this product, the dial feature no longer works.This phone was not used often, or abused. I don't recommend."
3,Nice but needs caller id,"Love the look but that it doesn't have caller id. We installed it in our spanking new kitchen and like not having to search for a phone but with so many telemarketers, I still run around looking for a phone with caler id before I answer it."
2,The phones break in six months,The phone broke in six months and I was not able to get it fixed. I need a new phone and I cannot buy it at a local store anymore because they don’t sell them since everyone has a cell.
1,liked at first but...,"I loved the look of this phone and the sturdiness of it. It worked fairly well for about a month, but then I started with crackling and with callers not being able to hear us. I went to return it, but the store no longer carried it. I would NOT buy this phone again and it ended up in the trash..."
1,Bad phone!,"I purchased this phone because I loved the vintage look and it went perfect with my kitchen. After 4 weeks I noticed that every time I went to use the phone the person on the other end could not hear me. At first I thought it was the cord so I bought a new one, only to discover it was not the cord, it was the receiver. My husband took it apart to see if he could fix it and nothing. I was so disappointed. I called the company who makes the phone and am now waiting for one of their technicians to decide whether its a product malfunction in order to send me a replacement. Do not buy this phone, for the cost it is not worth it!"
5,phone,I love my wall phone. Just what I wanted. Made well. clear sound. Nice looking. Looks like the old fashion phones
4,old ringer,"A great look in our kitchen and a fun addition to all our other phones.In fact, it is a pleasure to use compared to all the tiny phones we use today. It actually feels like the phones of yesterday."
3,its ok if you know how to work it,I first bought the other dex car warmer which worked pretty good but for long car trips it could only be used once then i bought this one it works ok but i do have agree with people it takes forever to warm up but the trick is if you use the powedered milk to heat up the water only then add everything it takes about 20 for mine to get at the right temp my son loves is milk really warm but you can't expect much more for the price!!!
1,WAY TOO LONG TO WARM UP!,"I tell you the truth. I was so happy that this existed. But quickly became disappointed. It took so long and it never really made a diference. I find it easier to just sit it on my lap or snug between my thighs and warm up the bottle with my own body heat while I drive or sit in the car. It turned out to be more useful that way. When my baby was on powdered formula, I would heat up the water before leaving the house and carry it in a thermal pack. That worked too. Great idea, but needs lots of improvements. I am glad it works for other parents. It just didn't do the job for me."
2,Not Good at All...Unless you Plan Ahead,"It will take a minimum of 20min to warm a cool bottle but more like 45min to warm a really cold bottle (fresh out of the cooler). So, when my daugher at at Noon, I started to warm the bottle at 11am. This is crazy and I do not recommend trying to warm a bottle for that long. Sometimes I would go ahead and slightlly warm the bottle in the microwave before I headed for the car. Then I used this product to warm it the rest of the way."
1,Product of China - unsafe and not green,"This product is made in China. I would not believe any claims they make regarding allergy safety and vegan/kosher. Considering Mrs. May's markets itself as a healthy product, I was shocked when I glanced at the back and noticed this product was made in China. China has proven that we can not trust their manufacturing practices. Unsafe toys, dog food, and now we're supposed to trust them making our health food?Not to mention the carbon footprint created by shipping something halfway around the world. I will not buy this product anymore.I would rather purchase the Sahale snacks that are made in the US, even if they are a bit more expensive."
2,Not What I Expected...,"I bought these as a bit of a splurge, to have some nice quality tacks for art projects.But these have smaller, cheaper looking heads than my old ones (which I've had for years). Some heads are misshapen, lopsided, off center, and have little flanges of metal left from the two-part mold they came out of.Look under ""view and share related images"" under the main photo to see my photo comparison of these tacks.I'm sure these will be absolutely fine for most people's purposes -- they just aren't the quality tacks I was hoping for.Not worth the hassle to return, will look for the nicer quality ones.I should have read Michael's 1 star review before purchasing.I like Amazon and all, just wanted to show you what the product looks like, so you won't assume (as I did) that these would be the same as aluminum headed tacks you're familiar with."
1,Cartridge leaks ink,The cartridge leaks the powdered ink and now my printer is filthy with powdery ink
2,Definitely not stainless,"While this mandoline does a fine job of slicing, not all of the pieces seem to fit together quiet right. The plastic blade guard doesn't seem to fit on the mandoline, and just pops right off. So, I don't feel like it's being stored safely. In addition, the blade is definitely not stainless. I haven't had it long, wash and dry it quickly, and the blade already has spots. Gross."
4,Great new sleuth,"Jennifer Apodaca's novel DATING CAN BE MURDER introduces a clever heroine named Samantha Shaw who after her husband's sudden death makes some ""enhancements"" to her life. What is soon to follow is a series of sometimes frightening, but hilarious events that takes the reader on an exciting roller coaster ride. DATING is a fun read with colorful characters and enough action, mystery, and romance for everyone. We'll be seeing much from Jennifer Apodaca."
4,Work about like OEMs,"On a '97 T100 4WD, I was spinning out on washboards, so installed these-some help, but not a dramatic improvement. I've used fatter shocks on my other ('71) Toyota and a '68 Chevy that seemed to help lots, but this truck's stiffer-riding, so hard to say whether it can be improved much. I guess I'll just carry some weight in back and slow down some. These shocks fit well and look to be good quality; Lord knows I've put them to the test on Idaho roads, and they're still intact."
2,"Good idea, but...","I used the pacifer med dispenser and if you have to struggle at all to get your baby to take it, all of the medicine leaks out of the sides and the nipple."
1,Didn't work for my baby,"Seemed like the perfect solution, but didn't work for my baby. The medicine she takes daily wouldn't go through the pacifier when she sucked. Maybe the medicine is too thick or maybe the pacifier just doesn't work"
5,Stellar explanation of the psychology of an adopted person,"Adoption Healing got me in touch with hidden feelings that I didn't even know I had. I now understand myself in a new way, a way that will help me heal from the separation of my mother at birth. Soll's book is a wonderful follow-up to Nancy Verrier's Primal Wound. All those who have been touched by adoption should make this wonderful book a bible."
3,Adoption Healing: A Path to Recovery,"Joe Soll draws heavily from John Bradshaw's works about ""inner child"" healing. The reader is encouraged to heal through self-affirmations. I also recommend that triad members read Sherrie Eldridge's books."
5,A surprising hit!,"I have been a madden fan for ever. I would never have played anything else besides madden football, except my buddy brought NFL 2K5 over. Call me a traitor, I aint ever going back to Madden again! Here is why I switched:Pros:1. graphics are much better, each player looks like the real one, plus the detail is incredible.2. The gameplay is improved over madden, playing this game is almost like watching a live football game.3. The AI is much better than Madden.4. The play books are VERY in depth, this gives you many more options.5. This game costs less than half of Madden games.CONS:1. The controls take a while to learn, you have to unlearn the madden controls.I recommend renting this game to make sure it is for you. We all have different tasts and there is no use wasting $20 on something somebody else loves!"
2,Not an Acceptable Substitute for Madden,"Since I didn't want to shell out $50 for Madden 2005 and Sega's ESPN NFL 2K5 was only $17, I bought it. With NFL 2K5, you definitely get what you pay for. I started playing on the All-Pro level and within one half, it was too easy. The graphics are beautiful and the game play is super smooth, but the artificial intelligence is so simple that there is no challenge. I have went back to playing Madden 04, and my brother-in-law said he'd buy NFL 2K5 from me for $10. He'll like the simple gameplay. I'm taking my $7 loss and running with it. Oh, by the way, Sega can make better sports games than EA. Some of you will remember the 2K and 2K1 series that caused Madden and NBA Live to play some serious catch-up. They just didn't do it with this one."
2,ESPN or Madden,I have 'em both and this just doesn't have the quality Madden does. Madden 05 is where to be believe me.
2,Game is OK,"I've played it at a friend's house a couple times. This game is ok to me; not the best, not the worst. The graphics to me are worse than Madden, and the gameplay is WAY worse than Madden's. In ESPN you can't do hot routes or any of that stuff...it stinks. I've seen a video on some of the ESPN features, and that looks pretty cool. So from that standpoint it's probably a good game. But it's not for me, personally. I'm a Madden freak."
1,JUST BUY MADDEN,"this game is terrible. There is a reason its so cheap. Madden blows it away. Spend the extra cash on Madden , You'll be happier."
5,"""Sugar"" Rules!","Although none of my friends have ever even heard of this cd or Stretch Princess, I love ""Sugar,"" it's the best song!"
4,Background beauty.,"This is a lovely album. 'Lovely' being the operative word. It is a collection sticking almost entirely to mid-tempo, rock/pop tunes. Jo Lloyd, the very english singer, is not going to challenge Whitney Houston in the vocal department but she sings with a pleasing tone and suits the music perfectly. The stand out track, for me, is 'Universe'. (Featured on Buffy the Vampire Slayer). A Solid rock tune that gets me going everytime. The bulk of the album is perfect summer background music. Not quite enough to hold your full attention for its entirety. For those who enjoy rock/pop tunes, fronted by female vocalists (think The Sundays and The Bardots), you will enjoy this album, as will most who just like music to make them feel good, not stretch boundaires (Excuse the pun!)."
3,Quick response,Best price - fast shipping. Haven't put them in the car yet! Looks like good quality; well made.
5,Captivating,I was captivated by this book from early on in the story. Epitaph is an awesome thriller. It is an intriguing book by all standards and is nearly impossible to put down. I recommend this book to anyone who likes a good suspense thriller. I enjoyed it more than any other book I've read in recent memory.
3,"It depends on the PC - one great, one bombed","I purchased two of these for two different PCs, both running the most updated versions of Windows XP but not identical boxes. Installation on the first machine was flawless, configuration easy, worked as well as I would expect with a sub-$100 webcam on both AIM and Skype. Audio surprisingly good, and video a little uneven exposure-wise, but quite good. Then installed the second one on the other PC and nothing but problems. Software installed easily, but every time I got to the step of plugging in the USB cable of the camera I got the Windows' blue screen of death and had to shut down. Some web postings say to disable the mic to solve the problem. Sort of defeats the purpose of having a ""fusion"" camera. Returned one, kept one. I give it 3 stars as a blend of a 4 and a zero."
4,"Good pictures, difficult for notebooks","The quality of the product is good: easy to install, easy to handle, good quality of the picture. However, using a notebook it is not very pracitcal as it does not attach to it properly. You have to set it on a desk in front of you. For that reason I will buy something else. For a regular monitor this product is great!"
4,Good camera.,"Good web camera.The built-in mic is very helpful.Also comes with headset.Though the picture quality is good,it could have been improved.Excellent lowlight performance.Clip is good for desktop."
1,Lacks parts,While i hear all teh best about this camera my very first impression is that upon opening its its already missing Parts Mainly the stereo headset. if i cmpany cant get it correct at the plant than im not interested it.
4,Web Cam grandma,"I have enjoyed watching my grandson with good color. However, the picture I send I have been unable to get the color in a good transmission. Will keep trying. Picture quality good."
5,Best Value in Webcams...period,"I just had a great experience with Logitech support and it prompted me to say some nice things. I have a number of logitech products, I have this Fusion webcam which I take on the road with me so I can see my family each night I spend in a hotel on business. It's fun and takes some of the sting out of travel. It works great with MSN.I also had some problems with a Quick Cam Pro 4000. Let me tell you that they determined the hardware was the issue and made immediate arrangements to replace the device. Quick and painless.If you haven't tried their Harmony remote controls and are interested in ditching the 5 remotes you are using now, it doesn't get any easier. Plug it into your PC, answer a few questions, then hand it to your 6 year-old and she will be ready to control your media system."
2,not even close to my old webcam!,I was greatly disappointed in the performance of this camera! I have an old intel pro webcam that completely blows the visual quality away on this cam! So....... I went to e-bay and picked up 2 more intels!!!!!!!
2,Poor install software,"Installed the camera and my sound was disabled from my entire computer. No help on their site. Google returned similar problems with convoluted solutions. To fix, I had to uninstall my Audio drivers and reboot. Really pisses me off when relatively insignificant software messes with my system. I thought Vista would prevent this type of thing. Apparently not!"
3,"Good camera, but","Very good picture quality. The audio is useless. Maybe its the application software, but the audio is so broken up as to be non existant. Installation is difficult unless you turn off all non essential services and startups. This is mildly hinted to when installing. If you don't do this it will take a call to tech support to reverse the bad installation before proceeding. Logitech acknowledges the audio problems and says a fix may be coming, no promise of when. Did not work on XP Media edition and only some of the apps worked on a 3 yr old laptop running Windows XP Pro. On a newer laptop running XP Home Edition all features worked."
5,Just what the doctor ordered....,"It does what its supposed to do - the camera quality is nice, and it fits comfortably on top of my LCD screen - the included microphone is actually very very good, which somehow manages to filter out feedback from the speakers when using it for videophone. I also like the fact that there's a little light that turns on when the camera is recording. Overall, a very good purchase. I highly recommend it."
4,overall i'm satisfied...,"For people that have driver problems it could be that your computer is too slow and is overloaded. Also, when setting up the webcam it is important to put the cd in first before you connect the usb into the webcam or else you might have some software problems. Overall I am pretty satisfied with the cam, but the cam seems incredible slow with yahoo messenger for some reason. Windows messenger works a lot better...anyways Quickcam Fusion is a pretty good product and its probably the best camera out there from all the reviews i have read. I give it 4 stars only because it sux with yahoo messenger."
4,Great webcam for the price.,"I purchased this webcam after reading many reviews and haven't been disappointed. It's easy to install, basically plug-n-play, and really easy to use. The webcam came with a headset/microphone, even thought there's a microphone built into the webcam itself.The software is pretty cool, allowing you to create video emails or snap photos (which you can also do using the button on the top of the webcam).My family has purchased several of these so we can communicate using video through Skype.I've had no problem using mine on XP Professional at work, but when I use it at home on XP Home, sometimes I have to restart the computer to get it working properly. Another family member got the ""blue screen of death"" after following the directions for installation, had to unplug it, restart and reinstall before getting it to work properly (we're still trying to figure out where the conflict was).All in all, it's a great little webcam and you can't beat the price."
4,"really good, but not great webcam","I use this with Microsoft Windows Messenger (the most reliable service I've found). The quality of the images are good, and the built in microphone works well. The only thing I'm not too impressed with is the ability to adjust to the lighting situations (I use it facing away from a big sliding glass door I have to my balcony). Overall, though, I'm a Logitech product fan, and this is a very solid web cam [...]"
2,Logitech drops TWAIN and WIA support,"I bought this camera a little while ago. It works great as a webcam and the mic picks up sound very nicely.Unfortunately, Logitech has decided to drop TWAIN and WIA support in their drivers in their latest QuickCam 11.x software. If you need this type of support, take a look at Creative Labs. I recently had a need for this feature for integrating image capture with other software. I can't do it with this webcam."
4,very good webcam,"I purchased it about a month ago. So far only tried it for AIM6 (PC --> MAC, there is iSight on the MAC). It works very well. The RightLight technology is amazing especially. The cons are that sometimes it takes a few tries to set up the connection, and usually the error message says not enough band width, although both sides are using >10 MB LAN; and the image on the MAC does not have very high resolution."
2,Bad audio,"We purchased two cams (Nov. 22nd) as a Christmas gift for my in-laws who live 18 hours away. We tested them with my parents who live an hour away. The audio was so bad that we could not communicate with each other, even though we both have high-speed Internet connections. Since my father-in-law is hard of hearing we knew the cam would not work for us. We returned the cams to Amazon on December 13th, and as of today, January 11, the cams have not been received by Amazon. I was told the purchase price would be refunded, but I have not received a confirmation e-mail concerning the credit to my bank account."
3,The Bloody Bozeman,"Johnson M. Dorothy. The Bloody Bozeman. Mountain Press Publishing Company Missoula, COPYWRITE 1983In the story TheBloody Bozeman many settlers head west on the Oregano Trial in search of the gold that they had been hearing about back east. The trail was long and slow if you were headed to the northwest area of Montana and Idaho. Then a small party consisting of John Bozeman, John Jacobs and his daughter decided to find a shorter trail to get there. When they discovered the path they called it the Bozeman Trail. Many people took it but died because of the Indians. They were all over in that country. People had to gamble on which trail to take.This story had a lot of interesting things about what they had to go through and how they got there. I really like stories that tell you things like that. It didn't have much of a story line but it was a good book. I would recommend it to a person who likes to learn about the 1860's gold fields."
3,Nice desk toy at work.,"I got this for my husband for his desk at work. Just a novelty, but it passes the time every now and then when he's on hold with a customer/client. This year, I bought more for his co-workers as office gifts."
2,Not very challenging and not all that much fun,"Cheater is a rummy-style game where players have to be the first one to spell in ""Cheater"" in one ""suit."" I agree with the reviewer who complained about the color cards. The color is the suit, and the four colors are peculiar choices -- red, yellow, blue and purple. There is an additional aspect to the game: if you roll the dice and get doubles, you get to be the Cheater. The cheater had extra powers, like being able to pull two cards from the deck instead of one during a turn, which other players can't do.Personally, I found it pretty boring, but I'm used to more challenging games. If you're looking to play a simple, quick card game, it's OK. Basically, all you have to do is know how to spell the word CHEATER and be willing to have other players mad at you if you take certain actions agaist them."
5,Truly inspiring,"Until I read this book, I always considered Gilda Radner's incredible comedic talent to have been her finest attribute; now, I am even more amazed at the courage and tenacity this woman possessed during her all-too-short life. She may have physically lost her battle with ovarian cancer, but in my opinion, her spirit and life-force won out."
4,From a big fan of Gilda,"From her earliest days on SNL, I could see that Gilda was destined for great things. Unfortunately, she was cut short. She made great strides, in her drama and comedy, throughout her short life, and we are all poorer, for her loss. 'It's Always Something' has a great deal of very poigant comedy. I heartily reccommend it."
5,Praise the Lord!,"I received the CD for Christmas and have loved it! I keep one copy in my car and one in the house. I've always got the McFirst CD handy when I want a great sing-a-long that is truly a testament of faith and love of Jesus Christ. My favorite song is ""I'm not Ashamed"". This Praise Team has talent; whether you are looking for upbeat Christian music to clap your hands to or music that will help you get closer to God, they sing it the best."
3,Lockenhaus Franck compelling but scruffy,"I spent a lot of money for the Kramer-produced set of interesting performances (and they ARE live performances)mainly to hear the Franck. Kramer himself doesn't play in this performance. The sound is a bit harsh and at times indistinct. The dynamic range is huge; this isn't a recording for anything but dedicated listening, preferably in a large room. The ensemble is often sketchy, sometimes atrocious, and the pianist misses quite a few notes in ways that are all too obvious. That said, the reading itself is full of urgent energy, quirky but effective rhythmic nuances, and above all passion. This ain't a ho-hum performance, but that's probably not a surprise from this group. The audience goes wild at the end. I guess you had to be there."
1,Not even usable,"This helmet was advertised as an adult helmet, and while inexpensive, should be at least usable. It is a piece of styrofoam, with a thin plastic cover on it that is taped in place and the tape was coming loose when it arrived. I put the tape back in place and attempted to use the helmet. I had bought the largest size of this adult helmet and had measured and my head size was within the range it was supposed to fit. Not even close. Could not get the helmet even on. The straps are a nightmare that looks like spaghetti, and there were no instructions for making them work. It is on the top shelf of the closet in case a grandchild comes to visit and needs a temporary helmet. USELESS!"
3,Magnets Don't Hold,"The Toys are entertaining. Crinkles, Colors, Noises, Textures & a Mirror. Very nice. All the things she likes to play with.We bought this to use on the arm of the infant seat. The problem is the 2 fabric straps on the Caterpillar connect together with weak magnets. Just a little tug on one of the hanging toys and the caterpillar disconnects from wherever it is hung.The 3 little hanging toys are great fun to play with. They connect securely to the Caterpillar with Velcro straps. But the Caterpillar falls off of wherever we hang it."
1,DO NOT BUY,"as a gift, I received the Sassy caterpillar mobile with suction arm which we've been using to attach to my daughter's high chair tray to keep her busy. We've been using it for many months, she is now 9 mos old. Today, I noticed that there are rips on the snail's shell which is covered with some shiny greenish-blue crinkly material. It looks like from her sucking on it has caused it to come apart. I am now concerned that she has been sucking on this and ingesting this plastic(?) or whatever it is made out of, which can not be good for her or any child. It can now be easily ripped apart and could have been further ingested by my daughter. I think this is a definite safety issue for any child of any age. i have contacted Sassy and requested they recall this item!!!"
2,not worth the money,"This toy is alright. My 5 month old son likes to play with, but not in the mobile state. The suction cup doesnt stick and the magnetic parts come apart too easily. In my opinion the design is extremely poor. the colors and toys are nice, but it doesnt work the way it is suppose to."
4,Peace & Quiet in the Car!,"My 3-1/2 month old would scream every time I put him in the car. I would have to drive with one hand on the steering wheel, and one hand keeping his pacifier in his mouth. I attached this mobile to his infant carrier and used it for the first time today. He was so mesmerized by the dangling bugs that I didn't hear a peep out of him the whole car ride!! Totally worth the ten dollars I paid for it."
4,Great idea,"I registered for this item because it can be used with the suction for the window or on the carseat handle or stroller with magnets. It has bright colors that are great and my baby loves looking at herself in the mirror. The velcro is a very small piece that holds the toys on and they do fall off sometimes. The suction cup would also fall off into my daughters lap, so I just started hanging the toy on the clothes hook and that works fine. For 10 dollars it is very cute."
2,Caterpillar doesn't stay together - UPDATE,I can't get the caterpillar to stay together in a circle. It has a magnet in the head and tail but doesn't stay together. Not really a mobile if it doesn't stay together. Also hangs weird without it being in a circle.3/5/07 UPDATEI contacted Sassy about the caterpillar not staying together. Their customer service was excellent. Responded the same day that they would send me a postage paid envelop to return the product. Once they received the defective mobile they sent me a new one and it stays together much better. I was very impressed with their customer service!I couldn't change the amount of stars I originally gave but I would give it 4 stars now based on the customer service and the quality of the replacement they sent.
4,Baby,"my grandson don't use this any more but he loved it on his stroll, it really help him to be quiet it."
2,Attention: the product has changed from the one I reviewed!,"I don't know how they did this, but mine was a much bigger pack. For the price above, I'd get it locally or skip."
2,Stains,"I bought this for my 20-month-old, and I was unaware that the chalk stained. Go with sidewalk chalk."
2,"If you wanted 1977, this was disappointing","This is probably the most disappointing CD I have ever purchased. I have listened to Girl from Mars over 100 times and there is nothing even close to that in Nu-Clear Sounds. There are no catchy tunes like Kung-Fu. The music sounds muffled. Unfortunately for me, I did not preview any of the tracks because I was impatient enough to buy the import version. I would much rather have received a CD with remixes of 1977. I have heard some people who like this CD as much as 1977. Don't believe that they are anything alike or you will be disappointed. The band has taken a different direction which I was unfortunately unable to appreciate."
3,A fine presentation of the Via Lucis,"Ball has done a fine job of presenting the significant events of the Paschal Season. The book does lack, however, the depth of spirituality and the all-encompassing intellect that Mary Ford-Grabowsky's The Stations of the Light offers."
5,Brilliant,"I have never heard such a beautiful blend of classical, pop and African rhythms as on this album. But despite the fact that they are a string quartet, this is not a classical album. The intonation, many of the chord structures and a lot of the rhythms are uniquely African. ""Bossa Baroque"" is a particularly imaginative piece, and SSQ do a wonderful job of combining bossa rhythms with a Bach touch. This is one album that everyone should have a chance to listen to. Who would have thought that 18th century European instruments could beat with the pulse of Africa like they do here. Some of the pieces are contempory, some traditional. Paul Simon's 'Graceland' album is saluted in a medley, and Sting's ""St. Agnes and the burning bed"" is given the SSQ touch, and all are wonderful. Highly recommended."
3,Not all that great,"I don't agree that this is a great album. It is inconsistent, not including the added tracks from ""Whose Garden Was This"". There are some good tracks on this album but to sit and listen to the whole album made me restless. Not one of John's best."
2,"Jackie ""The Jackass"" Martling","Man, I've seen more originality in a paint by numbers picture. This guy doesn't know what he's doing. Reading this book has lowered my IQ by about 10 points. p.s. 516-922-wine, chuckles, cackling screen saver,all folked up, big orange marble, blah,blah,blah, give me more moneysigned, Eric (Fred) Norris"
1,"Horrible Book, Not Worth Reading","This book was horrible. It did not have a single funny joke, I can't believe I read through the whole thing. Jackie should be beaten with a fish. And I should kick him off the show."
4,Love You Jackie!,"If you want to read an entertaining book that keeps you informed and laughing the whole way through, read this. If the Howard Stern show does not broadcast in your area and you want to enjoy some outrageous humor and get to know the man behind the bar of soap, this book is well written and is a good dose of the JOKEMAN! ENJOY!"
2,It's ok.,"This game is pretty basic. Graphics, sound and overall fun. Nice to have in your collection, but it's something to cry yourself to sleep about if you don't play it. The mountains always remind me of big piles of poo. However, still somewhat fun to play once in a blue moon."
2,A little disappointed,"I was a tad disappointed in this CD even though I listened to the little cuts on each song before I ordered. Actually, I was looking for the soundtrack to ""Zorro the Gay Blade"" and this sounded real Spanish/Mexican/whatever, so I took a chance on it. Kinda boring for Spanish type music. It's not something I will listen to very often though."
2,"Eh, not so great","One of the bones broke and the ones that didn't break didn't stay snapped together when assembled. Secret tip: if you submerse it in water, it's much easier to dig."
3,"Bare Bones Guide, Practical Computer Practice","I agree with the other reviewer that the major benefit this book offers is the CD-ROM if you plan to take the computer version of this test (which I highly recommend, it is really simple to take the FTCE tests on the computer, you work individually at your testing center, and you can find out if you passed immediately). I am currently studying for the Professional Ed and am using the book as a bare bones guide of which I will fill in from my knowledge and research. Additionally, the CD-ROM tests, as well as the practice tests in the book, offer questions that, although are not necessarily on the test, help you realize what you need to work on, such as if you don't know much about Piaget, you can pinpoint that, and if you don't know much about ESOL strategies, you can focus on that. This does not have all the answers and is really a starting point for creating your own study guide."
3,Good Pricing,"This product was shipped quickly and is good for the price. It seems a little too sweet in after taste for me, ( hence 3 stars) but certainly does the job for heart burn or digestive issues ( in our experience at least). Really worth the try if you have been stuck on a prescription acid neutralizer and it looks like you will ALWAYS have to take medication to relieve symptoms."
1,Awful!,"The hero's parents were absolutely horrible! They had his brother and him out of wedlock, subjecting them to the ridicule of Polite Society and denying them public acknowledgment by their own father, and wondered why they were so angry? Hmm, that's a tough one. The heroine's actions were also dishonorable and cowardly--claiming to love James while refusing to even acknowledge him in public. Needless to say, the love story was unbelievable, and the happily-ever-after ending more than a bit pat."
2,Average,"Great primary characters but I had massive problems with the hero's parents. I hated the way the mother completely defended the father, and accepted that the love of her life wouldn't publicly acknowledge their sons. Absolutely despicable. And the Mother kept saying to Abby (the heroine) that she should be willing to declare her love publicly if she did indeed realloy love him. I thought - how about you get their father to acknowledge them and then everyone else would follow suit!!! She should have been livid with the Earl, rather than lovey-dovey with him. Of course sons will hate a father who snubs them in public, and is too ashamed to even introduce them to their own half-siblings."
2,Hard to Believe,"I find the whole circumstances of the story unbelievable. Abigail is a beautiful 25 year old spinster. However, the reason she never wed and had a chance to find a husband is because she is busy taking care of her younger sister, Caroline, after their mother died. The age difference between the 2 sisters were only 8 years apart. That is just too small of an age gap to make it believable that Abigail is able to take care of Caroline. Also, their older brother, who is still alive, is a lord of the realm, therefore, I believe there are no financial hardship in hiring a governess, nanny, housekeeper, etc. Also 25 years old just doesn't seem that old by today's standard. The book keep going on and on about her being a 25 years old spinster. I just have a hard time overcoming the unbelievable circumstances of the story.It would be a different matter if Abigail is approaching 40. I would find that more believable."
1,More like raunchy Sex Lessons.,"I actually prefer romances with an erotic flair. But this story isn't romantic and sometimes the sex scenes made me feel sorry for the main character. In the interest of birth control, the author wrote a money shot into the novel, to which the heroine cries ""Tis so beautiful!"" I actually yelled ""NO. NO, IT'S NOT"" at the book."
4,Great Value Pack,This is a great deal if you want to keep from having to purchase these items seperately. Quick shipping also!
5,Fascinating read!!!,"I first read this book in 1969. It struck me then as one of the best books I'd read, a thought that stayed with me all this time. On a whim I bought the book again recently and I am devouring it. For those who are interested in society and how it evolved, this book is a ""can't miss""! It's filled with fascinating information and is written in a style that is compelling. After 40 years I can still say it's a favorite."
3,Widescreen???,"Be warned: The original 'Alien' movie does NOT come in widescreen in this collecton, despite the description."
3,"LIKE THE REVIEWERS SAID BELOW, BUY THE ALIEN QUADRILOGY","This is an OK set, but the Alien Quadrilogy is FAR better. The Alien Quadrilogy is a nine disc set, with two versions of all four movies, and they are the theatrical version, and the director's cut (Alien only) or special edition (Aliens, Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection) of each film. And there is about 50 hours of special features. It's $74.99 at Amazon.This Alien Legacy set contains only one version of each film and they are the theatrical versions of each film (except for Aliens)."
4,"If you don't buy this, I will hear you scream!","Two movies which need no explanation, plus the others of the acid dripping franchise. Scotts classic original, Cameron's masterful sequel and the other two films. But there is still hope: Alien 3 can be enjoyed for the early director-stylings or David Fincher (Fight Club, Se7en)and Resurrection makes a fine coaster for hot or cold beverages."
5,Finally .. one of the reason I bought my DVD player arrives,"I agree with some of the above comments. Now all there is to wait for is the Star Wars Trilogy. But onto the movies. Alien, a total classic and mastery of filmmaking. It totally reinvented film noir for the modern movie age. Aliens, definitely the best sequel ever made (sorry Empire).The simple fact that the colonial marine stands as the most recognizable icon from the whole series (besides the aliens themselves ofcourse) is a testament to how good the movie was. Alien 3, forget this one. Complete garbage, i like to pretend it doesn't exist, but it is there. The best thing I can say is at least on disc I can skip straight to few good scenes. The fourth is pretty campy and isn't in the same league as the first two, but it is an improvement over number 3. Sigourney is buff and Winona is hot."
3,Good basics review but that's all.,"Well, if you are a student new to the field I am sure you will find this book extremely helpful but if you are looking for elegant mathematical derivations and further explanations of baroclinic instabilities, for instance, it is not the book you want to buy. The emphasis is on physical principles rather than the math. Thus, I am not really found of his notation too."
3,"Good, but simple",Good and easy to follow if you are new to .net but not nearly in depth enough for a professional developer.
4,Great!,"My mom got it for me. It is smaller than I expected. But that doesn't matter. I love it. It makes me feel like im in one of those cheesy 80's movies. I really love it. On the downside, the numbers on the phone DO NOT LIGHT UP. So it is hard to try to dial in the dark. But other than that overall it is a great phone. :)"
2,"DIDN""T WORK","I purchased this for my daughter, and when we opened it, and put it in the power line, it didn't work. It did absolutely nothing. I returned it with no problem, and got a new one. this hasn't shipped to my house yet, and I'm hoping it works."
4,A treasured favorite!,"This beautifully-illustrated book with its simple narrative has quickly become a favorite in our house. My four-year-old nature-loving son is always fascinated by the story that recounts lily's discoveries and experiences in her garden and her wilderness surroundings. Each spread also contains interesting facts and histories of the different kinds of vegetation mentioned in the story, which is helpful in keeping adult readers engaged as well!"
4,Really works as promised.,"I spent some time in -40c near the North Pole a little over a year ago when I purchased these. It was money WELL spent I might add. In addition to having multiple layers on my body, not loosing so much warmth out of my mouth helped me really regulate my temperature in those harsh conditions. I would suggest that if you need to use it you air it out a week prior to your trip. For some reason it had a chemical smell that was not too strong but not pleasant either.Great product!===================International Coordinatorwww.frimobil.se""Ls upp din mobil vart an du beffinner dig""iPhone, HTC, Sony Ericsson, LG, SamsungAlla Modeller."
2,poorly abridged,"This review is of the 1st graphic novel. The graphic novel tried way too hard to pack in everything that was in the full-length book. I've read the full length book and enjoyed it, but this graphic novel moved so slow, and was so wordy that I could barely get thru it. They did do fine on the translation to Spanish, but the content itslef was just not great. For anyone who likes the whizz-bang action of a graphic novel this will definitely disappoint."
4,"A beautiful, quiet book for the 7 and up","This is a beautiful, quiet book with gorgeous watercolor illustrations. I love this book, but unfortunately my preschoolers had no interest in it. Oh well, I will treasure it!"
5,Hilarious and sweet,"I read this book at the house of a fellow dog lover and ended up ordering 6 copies for other dog lovers I know! Can't wait to share it with them, as they will appreciate the not only the humor, but how well it represents the personalities of dogs we have all known and loved."
3,Famous Last Words,"CD re-issue of the third album by Robin Scott's M, originally released only in a couple of European countries in 1982. The star-studded personnel included Yukihiro Takahashi, Barry Adamson, Thomas Dolby, Wally Badarou, and Nick Plytas amongst others. The expensive Japanese import version has exactly the same track list as the UK version. As for the music, it's not as atmospheric and conceptual as ""Official Secrets Act"", probably with weaker hooks as well. However, tracks like ""Love Life"" and ""Yellow Magic"" (what do you expect?) do have a slight YMO flavour circa BGM, and the ultra catchy ""Smash The Mirror"" is notable for Novik's amusingly deadpan backing vocals and Takahashi's(?) hectic drumming.Correction : back cover lists track 12 as ""Eureka (original version) 6.14"". In fact it's been edited down to 3.16!"
5,HEAVY.,"This EP would be like hearing Metallica in 1986, 1984 or 1983 but sharper sound. Some really rare live tracks on this CD with the bonus enhanced CD-ROM video. Can't lose especially if you shop around you can get it for a respectable price."
3,great songs played sloppily,"I have to disagree that ""Unnamed Feeling"" is the best track on St Anger. I much more prefer the title track or Purify... because of that, the extras on this cd are the real reason to buy it. All the live songs are hard hitting, popular, classic Metallica. The recording are top notch for live although some of the instruments in a few of the songs are too distant. My main complaint is that the timing of the songs are off. The tempo changes in Leper Messiah and Damage Inc are muddled. The riffs in horsemen and hit the lights are off beat, and lars plays a few of the sons with the new st anger drum set. I like the cd but only as an addition to the real recordings. If I had found this on the street I would have thought this was a cover band."
4,Unnamed Feeling EP,"This is a great EP. It has some excellent live versions of songs from the bands first 3 albums, with the band playing them in a more mature, polished way, and with James giving it all on the mike as always. It's great to hear Robert on the bass as well, a seriously underrated player, even in this band. It's especially funny to hear James forget the lyrics half way through 'Ride the Lightning' and make a joke of it and carry on. Great metal from when the band were at their peak.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
4,Pandoras - 'Rock Hard / Live Nymphomania' (Restless Records),"Nice 2-on-1 CD title of the hard rocking all-girl band we remember as The Pandoras. First six tracks are from their 'Rock Hard' EP, which I believe I ended up wearing out my cassette copy I had many moons ago. Tunes I recall sharing with an older hottie I was keeping company at the time were the kick-*ss ""Run Down Love Battery"", ""Six Times A Day"" and ""He's Coming"". Cuts 7 through 15 are from their 'Live Nymphomania' title in which is just as good with their steady song list - ""Pacify Me"", ""Put Your Brakes On Your Heart"" and ""Bad Habit"". Should draw in fans of New Breed, The Runaways, Action Now and possibly Girlschool and Rock Goddess. Essential."
1,Junk not worth 50 cents,"Topps has a lot of nerve selling this junk as vintage. The 4 cards in the case are in awful condition and have no value, you are lucky to have ever heard of the players. The others are Topps archives that are worth 5 cents each. I am done with topps cards after 30 years of loyalty, Upper Deck, Pacific, and Donruss are the companies that will get my business from here on out."
3,magnifying glass not included,"As a serious amateur photographer and lover of historical photographs, I waited anxiously for the (Christmas gift) set to arrive - only to be disappointed. Many images are only 3 or 4 inches on the long side. There is also much wasted blank space on many pages. Would it have cost that much more in ink to make the images large enough to appreciate?? And Volume II has more images of clouds than a meteorology book - perhaps 25 percent or so of the total. I would really recommend finding someone who has a copy of the set and make sure it's really what you want before ordering. I received much more pleasure from the images in the ""Camera Work: the Complete Photographs"" book Amazon sells for $10. If you like Stiegitz and the pictorialists, then ""Camera Work"" is a must-have."
1,Not for Everyone,"I think Bertram's book needs to be more explanatory in nature for the maths and physics, not everybody has the mathematical and physics background to read the book, especially for engineers. I have written somewhere else that unless you have solid understanding in undergraduate and graduate engineering electromagnetic theory, this book is very hard to understand. It is a killer. Since I have not understood it, I give this book low rating. But I bet that as I understand the book better, the book rating will go up."
2,Unstable release,"I read the reviews first saying how unstable Nortons Systemworks 2006 was, but being a satified user of Sytemworks 2004 ignored the negative advice.Now at least once every 2 days, I get errors saying liveupdate has crashed, or my definitions are not valid....Symantec support has an autofix tool to solve these issues (for 2 days)... but I thought I point of antivirus was to stop a pc from crashing, or needing to reboot.....I will not be renewing my Virus subscriptions once they expire... nortons has lost a customer!"
1,This program is TERRIBLE!!!,"It slows your computer down. There is no advantages to having NSW that most home page services provide. Programs can't load. Unnecessary glitches. Deletes all user information, but doesn't ask whether to delete it. A TOTAL waste of money and time. PASS!!!"
1,Great tool to learn how to re-install windows!,I am formatring my PC after this post. The program crashed during install and now is in limbo. No install - No uninstall - knotheadsthat can't help at the helpline. I was a symantec fan and have fought it in the past but now I am done for good. This is the last time for me. THere are plenty of more intellegent options out there. Just do a little search in the reviews.....ARGHHH@!@@!!
1,Norton SystemWorks,This is the bad software I ever bought from Norton/Symantec. I installed this software correctly but my system was crashed. I have to reinstall my Windows OS again and I lost my personal files that I can not recover. This is not a good to have. Also the customer Service is not good. I waited 3 hours to talk to a technical person still I can not get any help. This is vesy bad customer service I ever had in this country.
4,Finally got an upgrade to work!,I am using Win 98SE so this program loaded NSW 2005 on this machine. It was 98% successfull after a few bugs that the Symantec debugger repaired. I have been using Norton since the Norton Commander by Peter Norton days. This is as good as the other SystemWorks are. Trie it You'll Like it.--- Gene E.
4,No problems at all,"After reading the reviews here I was concerned about installing Norton Systemworks (NSW) 2006 on my computer. I followed a few simple steps and had no problems whatsoever: 1) I used Windows' Control Panel to uninstall an old version of NSW, 2) I closed most running programs using Ctrl-Alt-Del, and 3) I deleted all files in my temporary folder. That's it! The installation program went fine without a problem, and I'm using the NSW program now. There are a few upgrades from NSW 2005 and my computer seems to run quicker overall. So, don't be afraid of this program--it's another good utility from Symantec."
1,At your own risk,"I installed this yesterday on my laptop and it crashed the entire thing. It worked fine on my desktop but I had to reload my laptop after the 2006 install. I suggest it you are going to buy this junk then make sure you have your whole computer backed up/imaged. Trust me, you will need to reinstall your compter."
5,"PC repair for everyone, even computer illiterates like me","I'm not a computer technician. Heck, I can barely operate a computer! I ""grew up"" (computer-wise) with Macs, which never seem to need fixing and seldom wear out, but because my husband had a typical PC person's prejudice against Macs, I started using PCs. Toshibas, IBMs, Dells -- each and every one sooner or later had problems. Tired of talking to technicians from Wales to Holland, I decided to take an online course in computer repair and this book was required reading.Voila! Help at last.Information is thorough and easy to find. Fixes work.If you HAVE to have a PC and you run into problems, this is the book to have."
1,Disappointed,"This book, purchased for a class discussion, lacked 32 pages at a critical point in the story. The pages were repeated and in a very disorderly order. The book content was good but the production left me unhappy!!!"
1,"Sorry, I hated it.","I bought this book full of expectation, and perhaps this has led me to rate it lower than it deserves.Still, I hate the story. The book spends many pages on the joys of a frugal life, which I could not care less for. The book takes a very depreciative look at experts in general, which I find personally offensive (which might also explain my low rate of this book, granted :). And, finally, the aliens are just way too good. They have it too easy.If you can get pass that, there are a few interesting ""first contact"" parts worth reading."
4,An easy read that holds your attention,"Written for the YA reader, this book is thoughtful and well written. I especially liked that the main character is an older woman who proves she still can contribute to both humans and aliens. In a society, much like our own, that has no use for the ""mature"" woman, the main character paves the way for other older women to not only contribute, but to shine. Wonderful read. Bravo."
1,Xerox 6R905 Toner Cartridge,"XEROX 6R905 Toner cartridge for hp laserjet 5p, 5mp, 6p, 6mp, 6pse, blackI bought this particular toner cartridge because I wanted to try to get a better quality cartridge than the rebuilt cartridges that I had been previously buying. The cartridge arrived in factory packaging and was sealed in a metalized bag. Unfortunately, when I opened the sealed bag ink spilled out everywhere, and it took quite a while to clean up the mess; the cartridge itself appeared to be badly beaten up and several parts were broken off of the end, which I presume accounted for all the ink spillage.LaserJet 6MP's have not been manufactured in quite a few years, so the cartridge is probably old and I doubt that Xerox manufacturers them any more. In my opinion, If you buy one, it's a roll of the dice!"
4,Helping me accept who I am!,This book helped me realize how I needed to accept who I am even with my psycho-controlling mother.
3,Fun...but not great,"This was an enjoyable sort of book, though Flashman himself is not the sort of character I find much sympathy with, so I won't likely read others in the series. I wish I could say something definitive like ""if you like (fill in blank) then you will like Flashman,"" as it does have its moments, but I did not find it representative of any sort of books I like, nor any sort of book I dislike. Because it is the first in a long series, if it sounds interesting, pick it up. The worst is you won't get through it or will dislike it, while the best is that you will find more material for your reading list."
2,"History is interesting, but treatment of women is distasteful","I found the book very interesting....well at least the historical part of it. I enjoyed Flashman recounting his experience, and the tongue in cheek nature of his swindling, cowardly nature. So for this part of the book I would give it 4 stars (maybe even 5).But I found his womanizing so distasteful that I won't read any more of the series and couldn't recommend it to anyone. I found his unending attempts to use women (seducing, beating if they refused him, and out right rape) so distasteful that I gave it the two star rating (and since I would never read another in the series because of this-even if given free, maybe this should be a one star rating)"
2,A hero posing as a scoundrel,"I picked this up as perhaps the first in a series of racy reads, but it's author (meaning Fraser not Flashman) is too reticently victorian in attitude. The story is risque and winking rather than ribald. Flashman reports how bad he is, but it's mostly words. He casts himself as a coward, but in fact is the only guy on all the scenes of critical events (even if he fled there). There seems to be some accurate history here (footnotes even), the generals are so quakingly incompetent they must be real, and the epidemic warlordism still rings true. I won't read more Flashman because life is short and this text is so smarmy, racist, and pointlessly offensive."
5,Great Storytelling!,"George MacDonald Fraser kept me on the edge of my seat while reading his delightful novel. With an abilty to get in to situations where the courageous cower, the cad known as Harry Flashman cons his way through crutial moments of world history. In ""Flashman : From the Flashman Papers, 1839-1842"", the action and humor kept on growing to new heights at every turn of the page leading to one of the greatest moments of comedy the world of liturature has ever produced. Thank you George MacDonald Fraser.Long Live Harry Flashman!"
5,"Fantastic, not to be missed","This is a fantastic book, with the magic the the first book in a series always contains, even though most of us flashie fans count the one of the others as the best. The point of view is so unique, the warped view of an old scoundrel looking back on himself young, all make it funny, insightful, adventurous and just darn good reading! Do not miss it, and do not miss the others...."
1,Boring soft core,Awful movie that tries to blend cheesy humor with soft core sex scenes. But the mix doesn't work at all. The only redeeming feature is the presence of the amazingly beautiful Amber Newman. She's the only reason to watch this.
1,More like incoherent bore world,"The first 30 minutes of the movie are nearly completely unintelligible. The camera work and post editing are so fast and disconnected in any discernable manner as to make this mostly unwatchable. It was like an epileptics worst nightmare. The story was absurd, the acting terrible, but so much worse was the production. Avoid."
5,One of the greats of 20th century military thought,Wafare philosophy enthusiasts will love Liddell Hart's works. This classic work containing the seeds of blitzkrieg and maneuver warfare theory will resonate especially with those who admire those schools of thought. The first chapter on Jenghiz Khan and Sabutai is alone worth the price of the book. A brilliant piece of military history and theory that still resonates with thinkers today.
1,Don't Wait for the Movie.,"I got through about the first three stories in this book and threw it away. I've read many books on ghosts and ghost stories but this was the worst! There was an episode in where a woman's car caught on fire, while driving next to the cemetery where a loved one was buried. She got a wedding dress out of the car ""just in time"" and as she stood away watching the car burn the head lights were on. ""A sign from the dearly departed"" Oh, please! I call it luck and a coincidence! And I'm not a skeptic, either! Forget this one and read ""In A Dark Place"", trust me."
2,Unit not all it cracked up to be.,"The unit is not really an outdoor unit although it is described as such. The boot does not look as if it would be waterproof and would require some sort of sealent to be used to prevent any corrosion, so be prepared with this before you climb to the top of your mast to install this unit. The other problem is the terminals, these do not look as if they are corrosion proof. I would suggest that you cut the terminals off completely and use the copper wire to terminate on your antenna. Alternatively terminate with some kind of corrosion proof plated terminals. So if you are armed with some waterproof sealant and some corrosion proof terminals this unit may be for you! I have bought three on the units but it is not worth me returning them. The postage for the three units was more than the units were worth in the first place. Unfortunately you cannot buy these units in the UK."
2,Not what I thought,"Didn't read the description of this carefully enough I guess. I assumed it was a couple of ""Halloween"" type Bugs episodes that I watched as a kid. This is just a chopped up version of new and old footage. Lousy editing! I was able to pick up on the differences between the animation and even vocalizations between Mel Blanc and his son Noel. Not even any footage of the big, red monster (Gossamer). Pretty dissapointing if you're familiar with any of these episodes."
5,Minimalist and Excellent.,It's fabulous- dissonant and consonant- minimalist and yet still there. I love it!
4,Love To Hear It From Her,"I loved reading this book because I liked hearing her life in her own words, but I hate how early in her life this book ended, It ended when she was still married to Joe Dimagio and they were on their honeymonn in Korean. I would have loved for it to have been a little longer. Im really interested in what her life was like following this in HER OWN words!!! Other than the abrupt ending I really did LOVE hearing things straight from her!"
5,"Captures the highland atmosphere, and an aging batchelor.","You are transported to a highland croft, full of tranquility. Times past imagined before technology moved us into the realms of science fiction. If this is old age, then it is something to look forward to."
5,The most borrowed CD I own,"I've been trying to track down another copy for a gift. If you like Euro music (I bought it for the Eifel 65 tracks) you'll love the whole CD. Sometimes they ""cover"" a song since they don't have the original artist for the CD, but I can't really tell the difference."
5,Formidable,This book is incredible.You learn with it the other face of this application.You can get out photoshop and illustratorYou learn with simply but clever advice with Ted.Thanks Ted.
2,Disappointing,"I was greatly disappointed in this book. While there were a few interesting how-tos, I found most of the exercises mundane and designs mediocre. I would, instead recommend the How-to-Wow InDesign or the InDesign Cookbook if you're looking for a design oriented InDesign book (too true, not very many InDesign graphic design books out there, but plenty others if all you want to do are print/book and text heavy docs). Pass on this and take a looksee at the other two which I found inspiring, beautifully designed and well laid out - worth 5*."
5,I feel this was one of Kevins most in depth books to date.,"I think that Kevin jumped into this book head first and gave it one heck of a go. When i was first starting to role play, Rifts really attracted my attention. I relish the detail that the Palladium the masters threw into this series of books and have been playing for 6 years. Vampire Kindoms is one of the most in depth books i've seen so far for Rifts. This book comes highly recomended from some one who has been with Kevin ever since the release of the RPG. Bang up job Kevin and all the guys at Palladium. Just one more thing, I need to see more art work from Long."
4,"Good paint, strong smell",Bought for a college drawing class because the local art store was out. This paint has a very strong smell to it. The paint the other students got did not.
4,A book every teacher should read.,"As I read this book it was one ""well that explains it"" moment after another."
5,A must read for every parent.,This book is essential for parents to be able to understand their sons and daughters and their very different needs.
5,Stunning,Not for the faint of heart. These are stories that will stick with you well beyond the experience of reading them.
1,Inconsequential,"I really can't believe that they keep writing books like this. I was hoping to get something new but it's the same story with a different package. The writers treat the readers like children and the ""process"" is nothing more than telling people to prepare for their negotiations. I didn't need another book to tell me that. Getting to Yes and Negotiating Rationally are much better."
1,"Same tired concepts, different title","This is basically the same information that has been written in a number of books already but in an overly simplistic way. Both ""Getting to Yes"" and ""Expand the Pie"" are far better with ""Expand the Pie"" being exceptional. While the concepts in Strategic Negotiation are generally useful, the writing style leaves a lot to be desired. The information in Strategic Negotiation has just been written about too many times, so why not go back to the original sources? Don't waste your money. Buy Expand the Pie instead and create value in your negotiations."
1,The Real Classics of Chicago House Volume 3,"I ordered the above item in August 2010 and as of September 27, 2010, I have not received my merchandise. I would not recommend this seller for any further purchases."
5,A PERFECT BLEND OF TWO WORLDS,"COSI LONTANO....QUASI DENTRO is a perfect blending of Miles Davis type 50s and 60s jazz trumpet, the electronic avant garde of Karlheinz Stockhausen and the timeless sounds of John Cage. COSI LONTANO is a musical change of pace for someone looking for something refreshing and different in today's music scene."
3,"Concept OK, Performance Unexceptional","This recording pairs competent but unspectacular performances of the B minor cello concerto and one of the composer's love songs quoted in the concerto with speculation about Dvorak's relationship with his wife's sister, whom he courted first and who died while he was in the U.S. The annotator of the notes wonders if the Cello Concerto owes its inspiration to the sister-in-law. Rostropovich cannot be beat in the concerto but get him with Ancerl or Giulini (the BPO von Karajan recording is not bad but suffers from the conductor's preference for polish over passion)."
4,For the more serious film studio and Kane fan,"If you're looking for a glossy account of the making of ""Citizen Kane"" with lots of pictures, backstage anecdotes, gossip, this book probably isn't what you're looking for. It's a fairly serious study of what many people consider to be the best movie ever made. I happen to be one of those people so, for me, I drank in every step by step account of what lead up to the making, what happened during the making, and--perhaps the most interesting--what happened after it was released. Highly recommended."
3,Kept them busy...but,"My 6yo and 3yo kids had fun breaking into the clay/plaster. They enjoyed finding the pieces. Now, however we have to break apart each small pebble to find the last two very small pieces. The mess is amazing, but my biggest concern was them breathing in all the dust from the breaking then sweeping with the little brush that's included. I had to help them break into it, initially, and now it looks like I get to pulvarize the remnants to find the last bits, which is annoying."
3,"First copy was defective, Amazon replaced it. Great season.","THREE OF THE FIVE DISCS DID NOT WORK. I looked on the back of them and they looked like they burned incorrectly. I got a weird message saying that the codec was different. I am a bit angered because it was a new set from Amazon.com.UPDATE: Amazon has since replaced the DVDs in the set, and they work perfectly. I think that Season 5 of Dragon Ball was by far the best season of the entire show, if not the entire series. I would have given 5 stars if the set was not defective."
1,For children only.,"I felt a contrarian review was needed after seeing all the glowing reviews of this film. One reviewer says that the movie was stupid, with cheap laughs, but gives it 5 stars??? Cheap laughs come from very staged scenes. They wanted to show people being startled, so they have the older boy cleaning the tub at 6 a.m. by getting inside the tub, closing the shower curtain and making no noise - don't think much cleaning is going to get done. But it does allow the mother and the boy to be startled when she opens the shower curtain and finds him in the tub.Aside from the adorable, talented canine playing the family dog, the acting is not good. Still, it's a clean movie that children may find entertaining."
1,Don't waste your money!!!,I totally agree with the other reviewer who said that she couldn't believe Harlequin published this. The hero of this story never believed that his daughter was his and still refused to accept it right up until he was hit in the face with the fact that his wife had not cheated on him. Sure he apologized in the end of the book but by that point who cared? I couldn't believe the heroine took him back. Someone needs to show me the romance in this story because I sure couldn't find it!! I used to love Anne Mather's books but lately they all seem to be like this. I probably won't buy anymore books that she writes.
2,Defective Subwoffer,"I have a HTB307 Home Theater System since november 28th, this product has been working great but yesterday 2005/4/4/ after a fast interruption from energy service the subworffers dont power on again and checkit for see a blow fuse but the unit dont have the fuse, irremedialy the unit die and smell so bad.I dont recomend the system because this was only electric equipment fail in my house with this energy interruption."
2,"Nice, But Not Much Depth","This little book was very interesting, but it lacked depth. Merton lets us in on some very surprising information, for example, he was planning to take a Tibetan guru to learn Tibetan Buddhist Tantric meditation techniques. he comments on Sufiem, Zen, Taoism, Hindooism, and Buddhism with great eloquence, although his style is a bit dull. Even so, it is a wonder that he wasn't excommunicated for his ecumenicism. Few Christians that I know of would be so willing to look with an open heart and mind into the world of eastern mystical practices without being superior or condemning. He looks upon these practices with reverence and respect. Still, it is hard to get much out of such a small book, and little is really said, either about his own personal struggles or the religions in question. A nice addition includes his interviews with Llamo Thondup, the 14th Dalai Llama. If you're into Merton, this is a nice book, but it is not really for everyone."
1,Trivial meanderings from a loser,"The worst Hollywood book I have ever read. Not an ounce of tasty dish, not a morsel of insight, not even a dash of entertaining writing. He is so much on the fringe of the business that his best stories are about taking phone calls. Whew! That's a thrill."
3,Exciting,"Mr Weinberger, your book was okay. I always thought Hollywood was a cesspool of drugs and what-not, but I did enjoy the book and it kept up at night. If you get time, read Hollywood Con Man. It's harsh, but true. Not for children. I hope you write more books about Hollywood. Anne"
4,Mexican Vanilla,This is a wonderful vanilla for baking. The bottle with cork stopper is a nice touch and adds to the effect as a gift. Good product with a great taste.
5,daughter loves it,"My daughter loves geese so this was a a good buy at my house. They wore out bc they were ""loved"" so much so I have ended up buying several.."
5,Teachers book for Kids' Appreciation of Mom,The Piggybook indeed explores the essential mommy. This book shows just how much mom does behind the scenes and sometimes right in front of us. I have used this book for years prior to having my students create Mother's Day cards. I gave this book to a newby teacher this year because she borrowed my copy and loved it. So it is a good teacher book. Buy it and have it ready for Mother's Day.
4,For That Particular Timeframe It Was Good,"For those of you looking for anything more than a peck for a kiss this book is not for you. The story was a good one and the characters were strong. I was getting confused with some of the old time words, UK references and dutch remarks but I hung in there and read it in one sitting. I downloaded this for free so I wasn't disapointed but honestly I wouldn't have wanted to spend much on it I like more upbeat modern or historical this was neither. I found that the authors background was interesting which drew me to her books. I'll look for some more free ones. Enjoy"
3,Ervin,Nice! But since DJ Screw is gone I want something so hard that I remember tap tap this effort does not bring the nostalgia.
1,Don't buy this one!,"It worked fine for a few charges and then has almost no capacity. Not good value. I see that many others say the same. The Canon original battery is still excellent. There may be excellent 3rd party batteries, but this is not one of them."
4,A useful book,"Newcomb's guide is a great book, once you get past the initial training period. For those of us used to flipping through pictures of flowers and fruit until we think we have the right one, this book can be initially off-putting.My advice...get used to it. Newcomb's system is more efficient and more certain than flower-flipping. A good book."
5,excellent !!!!!,One of the very best books I have every read regarding God. Very deep! I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to know God in a very deep and real way!Very excellent!!!!!!!
5,wow,Wow what a great assortment of crappie jigs these will definently last me a while. I have had great luck with them as well wish I would of known about these sooner.
1,Should Be Zero Star. Very Bad and Bad!,"What else should I say? Had to throw away about 20 of them, some of them just out of the shrink wrapper.The Maha batteries are about 2-3 older (1500 Mah), but most of them still working.Do not buy! Junk."
2,I expected something a little different...,"Maybe this is stupid: I don't know for certain, but I expected a piece of anime along the lines of 8-Man: After - never a live action movie at all. This was alright, but it wasn't fabulous."
4,very snappy,"I've read a few other toasting books because I am so in love with the art of toasting. This one not only has guidelines for coming up with your own, but also has some very nice historical and traditional toasts. The chapters on being witty are very fun to read as well."
1,Bummer,"I'm glad Amazon offers a full refund. I was really looking forward to receiving this CD but I was let down by the record label that issued this compilation. Not by Amazon but by Island Records and this re-re-issue of this ""collection"". Thanks Amazon for the full refund. I just hope one day whoever has the rights to Miss Grace Jone's recordings will release a proper ""Anthology"" of her career. She is so talented but she was shuffled around from label to label and got screwed over by the various record companies she was signed to. So sad that such a talented artist got caught up in the music industry BS. Miss Grace, you have thousand's of fans out here...still. Hope you release some new jam's soon. Cheers!"
3,"Good drive, but DVD write not working after one and half years.","It's a good drive. I have used it to burn a lot of CD and DVDs. But after only one and half year, it suddenly died on writing DVD. Everytime I tried to write DVD, it gives me the information ""Power calibration error"". I haven't found a solution yet. However, CD writing is good. So it is not totally dead."
3,Okay,I got this toy and after a while the head started coming off. Later the head just fell off all together. The durablity is not that good.
3,dont buy it,"this camera is decent with decent shots during the day. it takes horrible shots at night cuz the flash is too weak and the red eye reduction is horrible because it causes blurry pictures. stay away, aps has its limtations. get an olympus 35 mm camera"
4,Great picts for reasoable price,"I think that this camera has delivered some great photos at hundreds less than other makes. If $ s an issue, this one does the job."
4,stamp pad,"Haven't used it yet, but as always, it was delivered in a timely matter (with other items). It helped me get free shipping when combined with the rest of my order!"
2,Primer? Maybe. Reference? No Way,"There are two polarized schools of thought in the customer reviews of this book. Most say 'its the best' while a few of us say 'waste of time'. My read is that its a decent into to servlets for novices. But it is ultimately insufficient for anyone doing serious proffessional servlet work. The table of contents covers almost all the bases you'd want a servlet book to cover. But it gets increasingly shallow as you get into it. And the examples just don't cut it.Bottom line: its not a bad first taste of servlets for novices. But if you do servlets proffessionally, this is a light read. Expect to need another reference text."
1,A Waiste of Money,"I wish there were a ""no star"" or ""half star"" rating.Doesn't cover JSP. Too abstract, not enough information. Returned it immediately. The author sure gives it a shot and has heart, just not the same experience as in other books.I recommend ""Java Servlet Programming"" (can't go wrong with O'Reilly although this is somewhat out of date) and I was recently pleasantly surprised to find ""Professional Java Server Programming"" which covers a little of JINI (very well the next wave of replacement for J2EE, etc.)I'll admit I have always found O'Reilly books to be better than WROX (sp?), but this is rapidly changing. Could O'Reilly be falling behind?Whatever you don't buy this book, either of the other two are well worth the additional money."
3,Shinjuku Incident,I was a little disappointed in this movie. It starts out slow and never seems to gather much speed. Jackie Chan doesn't seem to be his usual self and there is no comedy as in most of his films. I have watched it only once.
1,Don't waste your money,I bought this bag to take my bike to europe. My mechanic almost laughed at me. There is no fork mount and it's a canvas type material so...unless your bike is a $100 wallmart special that you do not care about getting messed up...DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE! For another $140 you can get a hard case with a fork mount somewhere else.
4,Great book but not quite up to the level of his other excellent works,"I enjoyed re-acquainting myself with the superbly drawn WW1 RFC characters but the story was not quite as robust as War Story or A Good Clean Flight. Still, a must for Derek Robinson fans and well worth reading."
1,Anti Pentecostal junk,The late author was a respected Bible Professor.I dont like bashing his book.But i cannot accept his views on faith healers and his anti Pentecostal anti Charismatic stance.Because of this i could never again recommend anything of his to anyone. The book is in my trash.
2,Never Comes Together,"Having read a couple Martin Amis books, and more or less enjoyed them, I figured I should check out something by Amis pere. Set on an army base in (apparently) the 1960s, this book tries to blend farce with love story with meditation on the fallacy of God. It doesn't ever really all come together, and in fact no one element works very well on its own either. The farce aspect just wasn't that funny, the love story was hoary and trite, and the meditations of the cruelty and indifference of God seemed rather forced into the rest of it. There are some good scenes here and there, and a large cast of nutty characters, but rarely was I made to care about any of them. Guess I'd better stick to Martin."
2,Gotta agree with REX on this one...,"Something must have gone horribly wrong in the remastering, as this disc sounds as soft and flat as the original Wax/Trax! discs (at least in the case of Pailhead and 1000 Homo DJs). It's a shame as the other Ministry/RevCo reissues are so ""in your face"". Perhaps a ""WTF???"" e-mail to Ryko is in order...."
2,"like, seriously, this movie was terrible!","okay, i am a HUGE horror movie fan. and this actually looked pretty scary, even though i knew it wasnt going to be AMAZING. IT WAS TERRIBLE!!! i saw it with people who get scared very very easily, and even they said it sucked. it had no story, was not scary AT ALL, so i really dont recommend this"
4,its good really!!!!,this movie was great but not amazing but its good to pass the time.the only reason i did not give this 5 satrs is because tha characters of stone and tim sucked really bad at acting and after the half hour it gets a little boring but it gets better of course but this movie rocked it has a dark gloomy feeling nice story and great effects
1,Zero stars,"The was the one where the VHS tape kills people. There was the one where the video game kills people. Now here's one where the internet kills people. These sure are some tech savvy ghosts. I guess nobody reads books anymore.Honestly, these movies are getting so boring. What ever happened to the word ""horror""? Film makers seem to have forgotten.And the black people in this film should have learned from ""Scary Movie"" that they'd be killed off. Thank goodness the beautiful white man and woman made it out though."

1,This movie has no pulse. It's completely dead.,It contains no suspense nor horror. I watched it in the theatre and got bored after 30 minutes. The special effects are exactly like those of a bad video game. I mean I can see they look obviously fake. The acting is like that of a bad B movie. It seems remaking a Japanese hit movie does not guarantee a success in North America.Save your money on this.
2,Was almost decent until.....,"they introduced the RED TAPE. Uhmmm that made the whole movie null and void for me. After that it just seemed like a very drawn out Veronica Mars ""Halloween"" episode.*SPOILERS*This film is about evil spirits who have a vendetta against pc's, cellphones, and PDA's. God forbid you own either or else you will be visited by one of these beings. Forget about being killed on the spot. It just makes you so depressed you want to commit suicide or better yet you turn into what looks like remnants of an ashtray. Oh but wait, theres more you can keep the spirits at bay w/ red electrical tape. Sounds preposterous right?! Well it is.To sum up, this movie was a hot ""thrown together at the last minute"" mess."
1,No Pulse to be Found,"While Kristen Bell is an actress with great appeal and potential, this movie does little to forward her career. It's not scary and it is completely illogical. Even putting your brain on hold (which I did), I was still counting the minutes until the story would end. What might have been a creepy premise in the original Asian film simply doesn't translate in this Americanization."
1,Possible the WORST UPS being sold,"Stay away from this UPS. Nothing positive about this UPS can be said.I have 4 UPS units in my house, all APC, all reliable. I bought this for my Mom since it was cheaper and she didn't want to spend that much. I'm not sure if it ever protected her equipment or provided backup power. But I am sure that hers is now dead (less than 2 years old).Add to that that it does not have shutdown software for Mac OS X or Linux and you have a real stinker of a UPS here.It also seems that Energizer contracted out support and the support contract got sold to Audiovox. They seem nice, but you better have your receipt, or else no warranty!"
2,Warning! Lovie means washcloth size,"This is no throw or blanket - this is a washcloth size square - yes, its soft and plush with satin on one side, but very very small. Completely worthless in my opinion. It claims to be 14x14 (yes, I should have read it) but sitting on a 12x12 pc of paper, it is about the same size. TOTAL RIPOFF. What should they call it? I have no clue. TINY square of plush fabric with satin border? I like the fur becaus its soft and satin because I get hot because I'm sick - but this is barely enough for under the side of my face."

3,"Ok, seems to dry out quicker.","I'm a teacher and I consistently use these pads on a daily basis to stamp students hands (600 hands per week!). I must say that I used my last Avery stamp pad for a year, and the new ones I just ordered seem to be running out of ink much faster... And I've only started using it about 2 months ago."
2,"Made for TV, not for Theater","I think the original movie was produced for TV. Thence, the video and audio quality can be comparable to VHS. Except for those who love old animation movies, I suspect that anyone will acclaim this title as a good DVD collection. However, the story can be enjoyable. I love the old theme music."
2,Never see Bonnie in a prom gown?,"I was annoyed by the story of the man who was sobbing because he ""realized he'd never see Bonnie (daughter) in a prom gown."" Though Bonnie had Down syndrome, she would most likely be able to attend a prom if she chose-- most schools that have ANY type of teenagers in them have proms!"
5,The greatest thing since laptops.,"This tool will become indispensable to you after a few days of use. This is a practical replacement for a heavy and expensive laptop for those individuals who mainly use the laptop for email access. You will find that it replaces your daytimer as well, but has the additional convenience of electronic updates from your desktop. The one button hot sync capability is incredibly easy. It assures that you will have the latest information from your desktop machine, and provides the ability to recover all of your information should you happen to back your car over the PalmIII."
4,"Great, but still bulky...","This is a great product. Most people know of what makes it so convenient and user friendly, so I won't insist on that. Just keep in mind that it is significantly more bulky than the Palm V. It also uses its batteries quite fast if you do a lot of input directly vs. via a PC and the cradle.A leather case with a clip is a must have."
5,I Got A Message From The Man In The Moon,"Better than A Night at the Opera, not as good as Duck Soup."
2,Plastic Saints,"This book like Schindlers List creates heroes which can be used to characterize the offical enemy as evil, much like a t.v. melodrama, while ignoring the complicity & collaboration of Britain & the U.S. in the very crimes they chronicle, when it suits their colonial ambitions. While Six Million Died. by, Arthur D. Morse a more substantive history, describes Britain in a far less innocent manner, but apparently the publisher could not afford Amazon's asking price for a prominent spot on their home page."
1,Check Color,"The picture displayed black dust pans and broom which is exactly what I wanted. However, I was shipped the set in blue, which does not work in my color scheme. Check the color!"
4,Great satire aptly captures Atlanta's ambiance,Particularly enjoyable if you've ever wondered what life is all about in Atlanta...Tom Wolfe takes satire to the highest level and zeros in on those areas where Atlanta doesn't measure up (he did the best he could within the limits of a single volume). I'd have given this a 5 star rating but the ending lacked a certain punch.
3,"Slow Start, Good middle, non-believable ending","Highly anticipated reading, some good descriptions of the banking business, alot of boring descriptions of clothes, cars and social circles. Some likeable characters, most are not. It seemed too me the ending was rushed, did the editors say O.K. Tom let's have it?"
4,I want the last 300 pages!,"This book was awesome! The early development of Conrad almost caused me to skip those chapters, but I hung in there and boy, am I glad I did.I really liked the comparison of real prison life to the social and financial prison of the elite.The climax of the book, in my opinion, was the final press conference. I was quite alarmed to see only a few pages left when I reached that point. It really appeared that the book was truncated. That's probably a typical reaction to such a good book coming to an end.Mr. Wolfe, if you happen to publish ""the last 300 pages"" of A Man in Full on the internet, I think it may be downloaded faster than the Starr report! I'd even pay full price at the bookstore just for that!Thanks for a great novel!DL"
2,A big disappointment,"Tom Wolfe is one of my favorite writers, and BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES one of my favorite books. Imagine my anticipation when I opened this book -- and my disappointment when I closed it. To me it was a sad rehash of BONFIRE, an attempt to jam every two-dimensional stereotypical character into a novel that would lampoon all of our society's quirks. I couldn't muster up any real interest in any of these people, no matter how sympathetically they were painted. The entire plot, including its creaky ending, seemed to be a BONFIRE rewrite, transplanted to Atlanta. If you're interested in horse breeding, one scene may interest you. If not, check out ELECTRIC KOOL -AID ACID TESTS or BONFIRE."
2,"Disappointing, shallow","Gave up reading this. Fell asleep. There's a lot of ground covered in this book, but so what? Spare me the detailed descriptions of hardwood, jewelry, clothing and sex between horses. This book is a mile wide and an inch deep."
2,Another Bonfire--Not,"I just loved Bonfire of the Vanities. I read it several years ago, and still think of it often (Master of the Universe!!! I have days like that!!). I was positively relishing the thought of A Man in Full. I bought it and deliberately kept myself from reading it for a couple of weeks just so I could look forward to it. Then when I finally started in--Yuck. I put it down in the middle in disgust. The characters were so completely unappealing that I didn't want to spend time with them. I forced myself to pick the book up again and finish. The last 300 pages were not so bad. Maybe if the book were a little shorter it would be more fun."
2,Attempt at Satire Achieves Only Insult,"Like the protagonist, I grew up in south Georgia and went to school at Georgia Tech. The territory is familiar. Wolf captures much of the flavor of this life. He ruins all this with an air of smug superiority that fails to achieve satire and results in unbelievable insult. There is not a single character in this book who is admirable on the whole. He can keep the money, but I would like to retrieve the hours spent reading this misguided attempt at God knows what."
1,OH PLEASE!,"This book is a waste of good reading time! It is clearly meant to be a satire of the wealthy, of race and racial issues, and of the narcissism of slice of a wealthy ""generation me"" class of the late 1990s. However, the only feeling this book left with me was a disgust of the cynicism, selfishness and short-sightedness of Wolfe's characters. I have to admit that the characters are richly drawn, and the road they take towards the climax is interesting enough to pull the reader along. Wolfe also does exhibit a great deal of courage talking about issues of wealth and race in very direct terms, which is a breath of fresh air in our P.C. time. However, Wolfe's characters, all of whom are pathetic and completely dislikable, stumble into an ending that is ridiculous at best as it careens off into surrealism. I kept reminding myself as I was reading it, that if it had a good ending, all would be worth it. That was a unrealistic expectation. Don't waste your time. Read another book."
3,"Mostly good, but bad ending does leave bad feeling","He does a good job building characters, and there are some really good passages. Way too long. In too many chapters, he would act like too much of a tour guide. The end is downright horrible. If you haven't Wolfe at all yet, go read The Right Stuff, which is a truly great book."
4,Great read with a sophomoric ending,"Well, how in the world does such a great author construct such a terrible ending? ANY and I mean ANY high school student could have come up with a better ending. As horrific as it was it couldn't detract entirely from the rest of the book which was well written. How does an editor allow such a travesty of an ending to stand? Didn't Wolfe have his wife and friends proof-read the book? That having been said, I woke up my wife at 4:00 am to read the section on horse breeding and we both ended up laughing so loud that we woke up one of our children. Depsite the bad ending it IS worth reading and I would recommend it. It is, however, not as good as ""Bonfire of the Vanities"" which was outstanding."
4,"Good, but not Wolfe's best","""Bonfire"" was a better book. ""Full"" is often redundant, long and drawn out. I much prefer faster pace. If you're interested in something totally different, I would highly recommend a novel I've found to be the surprise read of the year, Glen Kleier's ""The Last Day."" Literally, I could not put it down. ""Last Day"" has one of the most suspenseful plots and powerful endings I've ever encountered in literature, and that's saying quite a lot. It's one of those word-of-mouth books that came to me as a recommendation from a good friend, and I'd like to pass along the favor with my strong endorsement."
2,WAY WAY OVER RATED,Do not was your time. This is not a bad book..it just is not good. You keep reading and reading waiting for something to happen and it never does. This was a BIG let down.
3,"Great writing, bad ending.","I don't feel the need to wax philosophical and describe the book in detail like so many others have here (and did very well, I might add). I just felt as though the book was building, building, building, for 700+ pages, to something I was sure was going to be huge. Then, it ended. Abruptly. Unbelievably. Not a waste of time, but most will probably feel ""underwhelmed."""
2,Racist portrayal of blacks almost ruined a good novel.,"I bought this book despite many friends telling me about the racist portrayal of African American charaters. Their comments did not stop me because my love of literature would not allow me to ignore a book so highly touted. I cannot deny that many of the characters were excellently developed and the ultimate message of the author was good, however I did not appreciate the manner in which African Americans were portrayed. Wolfe's racist generalizations about the class struggles within the African American community were blown out of proportion and without any appropriate context. While these generalizations may have been due to the author's lack of knowlegde, I found them insulting. I must admit that although I was often insulted I did finish the book in about 3 days and found it enjoyable. I would advise African Americans and others of good will to wait until it comes out in paperback or better yet borrow it from the library."
3,A lost opportunity.,"For the first 300 pages, Wolfe tells a compassionate tale full of characteristic prose. The first 300 build a story best untold in 2000 or maybe 3000 pages. But Wolfe, perhaps answering to the publisher or editor's demands, slams on the emergency brakes and brings the novel to a quick, forgettable close."
3,dead-on characterization but a fumbled plot line,"We get to know and love all the characters, from brash Charlie to his trophy wife Siren(a), but where the book disappoints is in the ending. Of all the plotting possibilities the author had available to him--after all, he can make these characters do and say anything he wants--it seems that he suffered from terminus fatigue, that he had to bail out of where he had written himself into, and as a result the ending is unbelievable and disappointing--frankly, it's hard for us to imagine that our hero would act this way. Maybe the author spotted this too, and that's the reason for the Greek mumbo-jumbo at the end. Overall, delightful book but I'd recommend stopping about 100 pages from the end."
4,Great character development. Ending leaves you hanging.,"Tom Wolfe's ability to cronicle the American experience is evident in ""A Man in Full"". The characters and scenes are described such that the reader actually feels like he/she has been involve d in a Banks' Workout session or worked in a frozen food warehouse.I would have given it five stars if it had not been for the ""Scooby Doo"" ending. Having spent 700 pages with all the characters I felt cheated when two of the characters meet and fill in the blanks with a final conversation. However, I had a hard enough time carrying this book around with me and I would not have been able to travel with it had it been 1000 plus pages. The ending is not too great a price to pay for rich characters and vivid scenes."
2,An incredulous novel,"It was with great expectation that I bought and prepared to read A Man in Full. After three hundred and fifty rather tedious pages of character development, Mr. Wolfe finally nudges the story ever so slowly forward. With only 60 pages left the plot is still immature and despite exhaustive efforts, the characters are still transparent,their motivation unfathomable. The resolution of this epic (any novel over 700 pages) is totally unbelieveable and leaves the reader scratching his head. Unlike the more believeable though equally dislikeable characters in Bonfires of the Vanities, these people are too stereotypic. Then the book resolves with all the character acting out of character. Of the twenty five books I've read this year, the worst by far. While I live in the South now, I grew up in the Northeast. Not even my Northeastern cynicism is willing to buy into these archaic stereotypes."
3,Tommy Boy's Lost His Edge,"Compared to Wolfe's earlier work, this is weak. Many of the characters feel unauthentic. The resolution was not well thought-out. The narrative structure is unnecessarily disjointed. There are some good moments, but it doesn't feel like Tommy Boy's having fun in this one. Still, it could have been worse. I would buy it again, and read it again. Unlike Wolfe's earlier work, however, this one now disappear into my bookshelves, never to be heard from again."
1,Firewood,"This book sat on the shelf for several months before I got around to it. Unfortunately, that's where it should have stayed. Wolfe appears to be a clueless wordsmith, weaving sometimes great prose into a meaningless fog. His characters are contrived and overblown, the story a tedious morass. If this is what Wolfe sees when he ""observes"" America, then perhaps he should visit an optometrist. Halfway through, I was so put off by the hateful cynicism that is Wolfe's excuse for satire that the book literally went into my wood stove."
1,HAD TO PUT IT DOWN!,"On average I read a book a week. But after 3 weeks and 450 painstaking pages, I had to put this book down. This is coming from a person who has never put a book down without finishing it. Further, after wasting 3 weeks I couldn't believe that Wolfe was still developing his characters and to my dismay I couldn't for the life of me follow the plot. In fact, after 450 pages, I asked myself...what plot?I must say that after reading The Bonfire of the Vanities many years back I was extremely disappointed in A Man In Full and because I put it down, I'll never know who that man is, nor do I really care. How garbage like this gets published, and more importantly allowed to waste a slot on the bestseller list is beyond me.I'm off to read a real book and suggest that you do the same."
2,Big Long Middlebrow entertainment,"This book is fun to read for most of its 800 page bulk, and a lot of the characters are enjoyable to spend time with. It does not, however, live up to the promise of Bonfire of the Vanities. It opens in a smilar vein, casting a critical eye on a variety of interesting denizens of high-society Atlanta. It falls flat when it involves Conrad Hensely, the huge-forearmed Everyman loser who ends up as the prophet of the latest cult religion--the return of Stoicism. While it remains a relatively pleasurable reading experience, the last third of the book really calls into question what the author is up to--it was working fairly well as social satire, but when the last third rolls around, it almost sounds like a pitch for the Stoic religion some of the characters convert to. Didn't work for me."
1,Excruciating,I must be missing something. I found this book excruciating to get through. Seems it was about 400 pages too long.
1,Utterly disappointing,"Can you say John Grisham? This book foists a contrived plot chock full of stale, uninspired characters on you, page after miserable page. (""His name was Bonneville (or something equally lame), but everyone called him Bonnie."") Who cares. Not even airplane reading."
2,More fuel for the Bonfire,"If you liked the earlier Tom Wolfe, Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test, Radical Chic, The Right Stuff, but were unable to finish Bonfire of the Vanities, you might be able to plow through Wolfe's latest, but only if you have a week at the beach and truly nothing else to do. This is more social commentary on the level of Vanity Fair or the New Yorker. Interesting character development but reliant upon various dei ex machina to bail those characters out of implausible situations. Believable only if you think Fox TV would devote a weekly TV show to a fatuous cracker spouting Epictetus."
4,Holds up Extremely Well,"I actually read this one a while back but recently found myself thumbing through it and remembered how good it is. The worst thing you can say about it is it's not as good as Bonfire. Yeah well, what is? With the exception of a weak and overly trite conclusion this is a very solid book, with all of TW's trademarks to be enjoyed."
2,Like 2 different books,"The first 3/4 of this book was highly enjoyable; the last 1/4 was a grating, tedious, fingernails-on-the-chalkboard experience, too the point where it was almost unreadable. The direction the plot takes is bizarre and implausible, but beyond that, there is even a noticeable decline in the quality of Wolfe's writing. It is almost like a different author took over, without being briefed on the character development of the first 500 pages. And, if I never hear about Zeus again, it will be too soon."
2,Skip this one...,"Tom Wolfe is a wonderful storyteller, and he proves this for two-thirds of this novel. He shows the modern South for what it is -- turbulent, evolving, but clinging (desperately) to the past. The conclusion is baffling and ridiculous. I guess Wolfe ran out of gas, or got bored or both..."
1,be a part of the 90s - get your matelasse counterpane NOW,"We already saw most of this story on Dallas in the 80s , sans the racial insights, with Jimmy Baker borrowed for the finale and Sue Ellen was torid. Only one small heart's desire of mine possibly qualifies me for membership in the decade, if Mr. Wolfe is its defining chronicler. And, that desire is mentioned at least 4 times as THE signature ornament of the standard luxury mansion bedroom, and the attic room occupied by the Stoic --- the matelasse counterpane. Maybe I could relate to the story, reclaim my rightful place as a member of the decade and the century, if only I had one of those things, or some dear friends from prison or from the billionaires' club. I got this book as a Christmas present and saved it to savor in summer. What a waste of 3 days! Florid prose, cartoon scenery, thin characters and no payoff of a decent end for the pain of slogging through the bazillion or so words."
3,"decent read, if you like 700 page books","A pretty good book. The character development was superior, though the characters themselves were an odd lot. The plot progresses at a leisurely pace, culminating in a wholly disappointing ending that makes a reader pause, scratch his head, and wonder aloud if Mr. Wolfe merely wanted to hurry up and finish the book."
3,A Man in Full,"Tom Wolfe's new novel, A Man in Full, is a slight disapointment. The first 700 pages were great, but the end of the book was a bore. The explicit detail through the entire book kept you interested constantly, making it hard to put down. The book takes you through the crazy lives of many people such as Charlie Croker and Roger White II, otherwise known as Roger Too White. The book's intricate descriptions of scenes make it almost real-life. The end of the book seemed like the author just got lazy and didn't want to write anymore. Although this book was very interesting, it doesn't live up to the Wolfe classics like The Bonfire of the Vanities or The Electric Kool-aid Acid Test."
1,NOTHING BUT A CROCK,"HOW MUCH MONEY? I'M SORRY, BUT I DON'T GET IT! TOM WOLFE SPENDS TEN YEARS WRITING THIS THING AND THIS IS WHAT HE COMES UP WITH, AN OVERLONG CONVOLUTED MISH-MOSH CONCERNING RACE, WEALTH, POWER AND THE STOICS? AND THEN, AFTER 700 PAGES HE RUNS OUT OF GAS AND LEAVES US WITH AN EPILOGUE TO SUM UP THE STORY. SORRY TOM, BUT SPEND LESS TIME DECRIBING WHAT THE CHARACTERS ARE WEARING AND HOW THEY ARE LIVING, AND MORE TIME ON CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT. GIVE ME A REASON TO UNDERSTAND CHARLIE AND HIS RABBLE. GIVE ME MORE INDEPTH INSIGHT INTO CONRAD'S SPIRITIAL METAMORPOSIS AND LESS TIME SPOTLIGHTING HIS IMMENSE FOREARMS. ( I UNDERSTOOD IT THE FIRST TIME) IT SEEMS TO ME THAT OLD TOM TOOK THE MONEY AND RAN. WELL, KEEP ON RUNNING UNTIL YOU CAN COME UP WITH THE ENERGY TO WRITE AGAIN."
1,How long could he have made it??,"This was the most drawn out book I have ever read, and I read alot. I like wolfe's work, usually! If there's an abridged version, I would recommend that. Save YOUR time!!"
4,Wonderful except ending is weak,"Quite vivid, wonderful prose; characters generally drawn quite well except no depth to any of the female characters (one small effort to provide depth to main protagonist's ex-wife Martha); One feels abandoned at the end, as though the author yielded to publishers demanding that it be finished. Even with faults, worth reading, and better than most out there. (By the way Tom, it's Lexis and Nexis, not Lexus & Nexus for the computerized legal research - there was even a lawsuit over that one.)"
2,Author got tired of writing and finished fast with epilogue.,"I thoroughly enjoyed this novel until the last chapter and epilogue. Unfortunately, Tom Wolf got tired of this novel and finished up the story with a wrap-up in the epilogue. I would really have loved to continue the saga and understand what really happened to these people. For instance, what could have posessed Martha to marry Peepgas?"
1,100 pages of content written on 750,A was extremely dissapointed in this #1 bestseller by Tom Wolfe. You could easily skip chapter after chapter and not miss a beat. Meaningless characters were overdeveloped and many subplots should have been left. I was so pround of myself for struggling through all 742 pages just to be greeted with a terrible ending.
3,An interesting & engaging novel but questionable literature.,"I enjoyed the story qite a bit finding it engaging and attempting to make statements about contemporary American life.However, the characters are extremely stereotypical under the guise of satire. The novel could have reached heights had there been more of an effort to make them genuine. The plot becomes somewhat outrageous reminding the reading of John Irving and that also detracts from its potential.The real litmus test is whether it is readable; all 700 pages. It is."
2,A Titanic Novel?,"At first blush it appears that the size and power of A Man In Full puts it roughly in the dreadnought class. Unfortunately, things soon sink rapidly. Readers suffer a heavy ordinance of a now familiar Wolfian device of contriving to place each character in the most tortuous situation possible. This gets old fast. Nor does the book tap into the Zeitgeist in the same way that Bonfire did. The biggest flaw here is the conclusion. Readers will heave an enormous yawn at the relently vapid and dippy culmination of this buxom volume. Don't buy the hype -- this book has about as much chance of becoming an enduring American classic as Tom Wolfe has of winning the Soul Train Lifetime Achievement Award."
1,Father of Glamorama,"Now we now who Brett Easton Ellis' direct literary descednant is: Tom Wolfe. Whatever cred he may've had back when boomers were society's tastebuds ain't there now. Laundry lists of socio-economically relevant identifiers. A narrative strategy that completely lacks subtlety and surprise. The ending says, Ha ha. You've invested financial capital and personal capital -- i.e., moments of your Life and Breath -- so I know you're going to love the ending. Guess what? Some of us retain our abilities to judge even when we find out at the end that we've been flammed. A previous review stated that if you voted for Clinton, you'd love this book. That says everything you need to know."
4,"unlike the stoics, I choose to complain","What a great story line. Colorful and believable characters. I found it engrossing... right up to the last 2 chapters. Did the author lose his way? Was he trying to end the book before it became 1000 pages? Was it purposeful? A commentary on some ridiculous aspects of society? I dont know, but after reading the book night after night, looking forward to the next time I could pick it up and finding all sorts of relevant use for the characters and the prose, I felt let down by the ending. The characters deserved more."
2,This is not Bonfire of the Vanities,"Well the best thing about this book was the ability to skim dozens of pages and read it fast. This book lacks the spirit and interest of Bonfire. The characters are too stereotyped and the whole thing with Conrad is sort of out there too far until the end, and then does not sufficiently tie. The better lecture on Epictetus is provided by J.D. Salinger 30 some years ago. I could have thought of better endings and certainly would have edited it more. Overall I found the book disappointing."
1,Over The Top Flop,"Simply, the longest cartoon ever. There is no grit here, just bluster and farce. Frankly, the story just isn't very interesting (even before it gets silly)and Wolfe must have realized that at some point in the writing, necessitating his shift to anexaggerated narrative that simply never gains traction or provokes any empathy for any character."
2,Great book marred by a bad ending,"As a person who has loved Wolfe for decades and adored Bonfire of the Vanities, I was looking forward to reading his second work of fiction: Man in Full. The great characters, the multilevel ""reversal of fortune"" story, and especially the acute cultural observations that we expect from Wolfe are all there. But the ending is a failure. Where the ending of Bonfire was both believable and fulfilling for the reader (man loses all the world but gains his own soul), Man in Full ends with Croker becoming some kind of pagan Jerry Falwell, preaching Zuesian tent revivals all over the south. Am I missing something, or did my revered Man in White run out of steam and throw his plot over the top?"
2,Disappointing,"Wolfe writes arrogantly, repeatedly reminding me what the Deep South (in his imagination) pronunciation is of hundreds of words. And he must be paid by the word since there is excessive repetition of meaningless sounds -- - crutches go clackclack over and over again. Interesting yarn but far below Wolfe's abilities."
2,"Too Long, Too Slow, No Ending, etc.....","It takes forever to get into the story line, but after a couple of hundred pages you actually meet all the characters. One of the main characters, ""The Cannon"", will not have a speaking role in the movie. If it ever gets made into a movie. Half the pages with another ending, might make a decent read, but I felt I could have done better picking a book off the bargain rack. This book is not as good as some of his early work."
5,Wow!,"Wow! and Wow! again. Get it, read it, listen to it. Absolutely amazing: real characters, real humor, a _real read_!"
4,Almost a Bonfire,"I very much enjoyed reading the book; but there are few elements of that enjoyment which last beyond the reading. For fans of the author from Bonfire, this book, in its exuberant prose and exposition, is a good reminder of how good Wolfe might have been. However, the depth of the anthropological analysis, which made many of the ahthor's books evocative and provocative, was not nearly as detectable in this one. Still, there are a handful of scenes that are tremendously well crafted in their cinematic detail and sardonic gusto. All in all, a fun experience to read; but not in the league of a Bonfire---but then again, very few are."
3,A love/hate relationship with this book,"Everytime I got to the point where I said, ""You know, this book really is great"", Wolfe would blow it with a ridiculous scene that was 20 pages too long. A sharp editor could have streamlined this novel into a masterpiece. Instead, there's just too many irrelevant subplots. The alleged rape, the fulcrum around which everthing else turns, is barely even touched upon. But hundreds of pages are devoted to Conrad's prison experience. Sure it's well-reached, but is it relevent?The most disappointing part, though, was the ending. An epilogue in which two characters discuss where the other characters have ended up -- what was he thinking? Not only is it the most artificial, unnatural writing Wolfe has ever done, but it's a hack's method of ending a book that never really goes anywhere to begin with.Expect to love this book. But also expect to hate it."
3,A Man (and No Women) in Full,"Wolfe demonstrates again that he is the master of characterizing the flaws and idiosyncrasies of our male culture. But, that he still remains completely clueless about women makes the book read flat. His female characters are straight out of TV sitcoms - either young and beautiful with ""luscious loins"" or old / ugly / poor with children and desparate. Mr. Wolfe could improve his understanding of life by taking Womens Studies 101 or at the very least reading Virginia Wolf, (A Room of One's Own) to get to know the other 50% of the population a bit. We're actually pretty interesting."
4,Some missed editing opportunities!,"I have fond memories of Wolfe's earlier works and I have the impression here that he was going for volume over value. There were some parts that could have been better edited and others that should have had longer treatment. Toward the end, when he attempts the resolution between Conrad and Charlie, he could have spent more time on their relationship and the reason why Stoicism is so attractive to Charlie. I had the feeling he was hurrying things along. Anyway, still an enjoyable, if long, read!!"
2,This is what happens when you rush to meet a deadline,"The reviewers who nominated this novel for the National Book Award must not have read the last 100 pages. This book (at least the end) reads more like Carl Hiassen than ""Bonfire."""
1,Very disappointing. Far too long and rambling.,"I found this book very boring. The characters were all social misfits of various levels of society. At the end of the book Tom Wolfe had realised that the book was too long so he suddenly had to bring all the characters together, so the ending was all of a sudden there! It was very repetitive in the descriptive passages. I was so glad to be done with this book and I cannot find anything about it to praise."
3,"""MAN"" does not live up to expectations","Though this book contains many excellent passages which are a pleasure to read, it wanders off course, contains filler and ultimately has an unbelievable plot structure. It does not meet the expectations raised by BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES. Once they hype has died down and the word gets out from people who have read the novel, it should drop from the best seller lists."
2,"Too much,too long","The author has certainly displayed his command of the English language.Unfortunately, he was too zealous in impressing this reader of his command of street and prison vocabulary. No reader should have to work so hard to follow his characters' long conversations. The author's descriptions are so long as to make one wonder if he is paid by the word. It seems that Mr.Wolfe reached a point where he did not know how to say goobye and did not develop an interesting ending for his characters.Four hundred pages shorter would have made this a better read."
1,Too many low points,"I felt like I was being dictated to. Reread the chapter where two men (the mayor and the lawyer) who have grown up together tour their city. The mayor explains building, history, and neighborhoods to his long-time friend. If someone did that to me in my hometown I would lose it. Wolfe has some really funny sections, but the overexplanations and obviously tacked on commentaries irked."
1,I'm sorry I wasted my time (and money).,"Is Mr. Wolfe kidding? This is one of the least satisfying reading experiences I have ever had. He loses steam at the end and wraps up all the very loose ends in the plot with a conversation between two of the characters. I don't blame him. I couldn't figure out much relationship between the two stories he is telling, either. He has filled the book with almost unreadable dialect. No one since Mark Twain has done dialect well, and even he used it sparingly. This book is a classic reminder to beware of hype."
2,A big ol' Peyton Place bore,"What a joke! Caricature's, stereotypes, high drama and an ending written with an obvious sequel in mind. Is this what all the hype is about?Not only are the women cartoon characters but so are the men. My first Tom Wolfe novel and probably my last. All the hullabaloo and I'm thinking, great, a well written, intense, maybe even profound novel. Perfect! What a mistake. The characters have no dimension whatsoever, there are no surprises and I finished this book and thought, what a rip! I'm surprised Oprah hasn't put this one on her book list. All those kudos and I'll never know why. John Updike and Norman Mailor have ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO FEAR!"
5,I love books like this!!,"I would have finished this piece of literature even if I didn't have to discuss it with my book group this Sunday! I always joke that I never buy a book with an embossed cover. Hee Hee. I've never read Wolfe but now I will do so again. There were many kernels of interest and I wasn't insulted by his assumption that I need help understanding his prose. Add to that the descriptions that seem to be there so the costume designer of a forthcoming movie will know exactly how to dress his cardboard characters, and you have an epic that has the good grace to have a reasonable ending.I love long books and I treasure description and this book is a classic! A very great classic. Praise to you FSG."
2,"Flat, contrived and not too interesting.",The two stars are for location and local politics. The writer could not seem to decide who's voice he was telling the story in. I struggled to finish.
4,First Book is Good,"This is the first book in Dibdin's Aurelio Zen series. It's a fine story that marks a good introduction to this series. You learn just enough during the course of the stories to want to learn more, which you do in future installments. It sets the template for what is to come: Zen is given a case that no one really wants solved, there is trouble. Good, solid mystery with many interesting secondary charracters. Read the first, you will continue to the last. Maybe not compulsively but steadily."
3,Slightly Underwhelmed,"After reading some of the posted reviews for Dibdin's works I couldn't wait to begin reading the first novel in the series. I must confess I was less than thrilled. The plot was engrossing enough, but the writing style left me cold. Dibdin's grammar is inexcusably poor for an English writer (I often wondered where his editor was) and the character of Aurelio Zen seems artifically ""tortured"", like a poor man's version of Martin Beck. It's an age-old ploy in the detective novel to have one's hero seem superficially bungling, only to have him solve the puzzle in the end. I just didn't feel Dibdin brought anything new to this genre."
5,An eye-opener for me!,"If you want to understand :abor Zionism, ... you have to read this book!There's a summary of it on Wikipedia."
3,Entertaining Mystery,"The characters in this book are pretty bizarre, but I didn't figure out the murderer until the end, always a good point. Enjoy it but don't expect Agatha Christie."
1,this is a piece of crap,"flimsy, light, loose, don't buy it. i have one i bought at sur la table yrs beofre and it was so worth the money. i bought this as a gift but am too embarassed to give. straight to goodwill."
3,Wish it had ideas for the infant-toddler stage!,"This was an insightful book and I will keep it on my shelf to reference again when my children are older. Right now, I have a 9-month-old and a nearly 3-year-old. This book was not written with these ages in mind. The author suggests that the youngest of the church spend time in the nursery. That is definitely an option, but what else is there?My oldest child stays in the worship service the whole time, but I want to involve him more. My baby stays with me until the sermon, when she starts to fuss. The baby needs a nap during the worship time and so is especially difficult to wrangle.I would love to know of a book that addresses the infant-toddler set more than sending them off to the nursery.Still, I think i will put some of the author's suggestions into practice when my children are older."
5,One of the best,"I love this book, its a must have, and makes a great gift for people living Outside. Highly recommend for content and pictures. Especially like the Slanamander chapter."
2,"Oh by the way, which one's Plink?","Well, this is pretty bad whether viewed as a novelty, as a tribute, or as something of interest to a Pink Floyd fanatic. The concept of new-wave piano takes on PF sounds like a minor hoot, but these takes are presented without any real imagination, creativity, or flair. Even by the pale standards of solo piano discs, this is bland stuff: in fact it often sounds like MIDI arrangements done from sheet music. You'd THINK a piano version of ""Have a Cigar"" would at least be interesting, and maybe it is for the first minute or so, but there is nothing here that warrants a second listen.I suppose if you are really in the market for Muzak-style background music you could do worse, but please, Grandma, DON'T buy this for your Floyd-fan grandson."

3,a bit too big,"The acrylic head on the bits are too big--if you need this for PC or electronics repair, forget it. The acrylic heads don't help you much because they're so thick--in any spaces smaller than 3'', you might as well have a full-size screwdriver, because this fat-headed thing won't fit. Tried drilling and breaking the acrylic, but it's much too strong, and as a result, 15 bucks was wasted on this thing. The finish and construction was decent, but the little rods inside mine that make the ratcheting action started falling out rather quickly in the other uses I had for the tool. Look elsewhere, there are better right-angle tools."
1,"Great build, aesthetically flawed","Okay, here is the deal. This thing is built well, but it's dimensions and performance work against it. It's height and width are just right for a pocket book, but it's thickness gets it in trouble. It's a clunker, if you put this thing in your pocket (if it will fit) you will feel it. Hell, it might even pull your pants down. The thickness also makes it awkward to write in since it never folds flat and there is always resistance when jotting down an idea, which makes writing a chore (which is counter productive to the pocketbook ideal, which is maximum convenience). If you are looking for a real nice small notebook, opt for a Moleskine. Pass on this clunker."
4,In a word... SCARY !,"The music of John Abecrombie is very diverse. If you liked John/Marc Johnson & Peter Erskine live in Boston, and expect this to be similar, then this music is not for you. The CD builds and becomes more complex as it gets on. Of particular interest is Mr. Mendoza and his percussion. Ubtypical Abecrombie, but a good listen (after you've listed to it a few times)."
4,Sharp and solid license plate frame.,"I recently opted to register for the custom NJ Devils license plate that the NJ MVC started offering this year. I figured these would be a nicer compliment for them than the plastic one I had on there previously. Solid weight, good shine, and an overall nice appearance to them. My only complaint is that no dimensions for the frame were listed. The New Jersey portion of the top of the frame comes down so far that it covers most of the New Jersey on the license plate itself (would effect any NJ state plate). Similarly, the Devils part of the frame on the base covers part of the words appearing on the bottom of the custom plate. Left it looking a bit awkward in the end."
3,Quality Control,"I have purchased this product from this vendor before, without any problems. This time the unit came with threads missing on the four base bolt holes. Easier to tap threads than return."
4,Hero? Anti-Hero? Does it matter when it is this much fun?,"Keller rules. I know that sounds like a 6th grade endorsement of this zippy novel (or short story collection?), but I'm just wild about Block's book. It was fun (and quick) read that is perfect for summer. Keller is killer as he well knows. The stories are funny and sometimes surprising. Even more, Keller gets to us. He is a decent and moral man in his own way. Block and Keller have a new fan. I'll be reading ""Hit List"" soon..."
3,where was the mystery??,This is an interesting book written from the point of view of the hit man. It just never grabbed me. It was dry and dull. There was no real plot and definitely no mystery.
4,"An engrossing, often amusing look at an assassin's life","This is the first Lawrence Block book that I've read, and I enjoyed it immensely. Other reviewers in this space have suggested that ""Hit Man"" is not up to Block's usual standards. If that's the case, then I can't wait to read more of his work. I found ""Hit Man"" to be a nice variation on the killer-who's-cold-as-ice theme -- except for the fact that he kills strangers for a living, the title character is pretty much an average Joe. Some of the scenes were implausible at best -- and at least one was completely out of character -- but for the most part I found ""Hit Man"" fascinating and utterly entertaining."
3,"As usual, a well-written and fun read from Lawrence Block","I enjoyed this book for its page-turning aspects and the high caliber of writing. It was fun to read and the characterizations were good. What disappointed me was that some events occurred without explanation and were just 'dropped' when further development seemed essential to the development of the story. Specifically, I wanted to know more about the end of Keller's relationship and what impact the loss of his girl and his dog had on him. I also did not get a full understanding of 'the old man' and what was ailing him. These things will not prevent me from reading Hit list."
3,"Not a bad book, but not great.","First, when I picked it up I was disappointed to find it was actually a series of short-stories, some of which I've already read in other collections (Answers to Soldier comes to mind). Some of these were new, however, and they did hang together fairly well. I've always enjoyed Mr. Block's writing and these stories were no exception. I think a few of the previous reviewers missed the point that the book was not so much about a hired killer, but about an everyday man with a decidedly different profession. Perhaps Mr. Block may miss some technical aspects of being a hired gun, but he really knows how to make his characters seem alive."
3,Hit Man,I found this book well written but a little bit far fetched. Is it really possible for a cold blooded hit man to be such a nice unassuming guy? I don't think so.
4,Inexpensive and effective but overpriced at Amazon!,"First, go buy these at Wall Mart for half the price as offered by Amazon. I should have done so. The chocks are lightweight, relatively sturdy, and provide effective holding. They will break, however, if you pull or back the trailer over them. The heavy rubber commercial versions are just too heavy and expensive for normal RV use."
3,They have worked so far...,...but I also use large rocks along with the chocks because they are smaller than I thought they would be.
4,Incredibly great sex scenes,"If you want to see a production-quality movie with sex scenes that are top rate and very realistic, then this is it. Most scenes are girl-on-top, including one in a hot tub where two girls take on one guy! And the moaning/orgasms aren't dubbed in after filming...you can tell that the microphone was right there when they did the scenes. In fact, if you pay attention to the positions and the body language of the actors/actresses, it sure appears that they may have actually been having real sex instead of just ""acting"" it."
4,Hockey Instruction:Ice Hockey Organization That Scores Big!,CHAMPIONSHIP HOCKEY DRILLS is a brilliant compilation of video contentthat offers top flight drills. Youth hockey leagues that are lookingfor a good organizational resource should view this.
4,"Good product, Minor problems","I like the product, it keeps my Palm III handy, however, it does have some minor drawbacks. 1. You will have to remove the Palm III from the case to operate it 2. If you have the flip cover on the Palm III it is a very TIGHT fit 3. The metal belt clasp will scar your dress belts. 4. I find the clasp will slip out unoticed from inside dress pants 5. The top loading cover panel seems backwards to me. I hope next years model incorporates some improvements..."
4,Great value! A must if you hate to carry things around.,"I can't live anymore whithout my Palm III. But I also hate to carry things around. Enter the Belt Clip Case for PalmPilot. It is extremely light, holds thightly to my belt or jeans pocket and it features a hard plastic screen protection sewed inside. I let my Palm III (inside this case, fortunately) slip and it fell all the way down on a 17 steps stairs. Not a single scratch! I wish it only had an internal pocket for credit and business cards."
2,Does NOT fit all Palm III organizers,"The Amazon description says it fits Palm III organizers. When you get the box, it says it fits a whole bunch of Palm III organizer varieties, but ofcourse not the color Palm III that I have.The Palm III color is simply too long for this item to be useful. It is impossible to close the flap.It did fit my friend's regular Palm III perfectly however, but he had to take the front cover off first. I would personally want to be able to keep the cover on, if I was to use this item."
4,Waking Ned Devine,"What a fun movie. I love Irish humor and this fits right in. The acting is very good, the expressions hilarious and overall a fun movie that'll give you some great chuckles."
5,Irish humor at its best,Those of us that grew up in an Irish household may have to translate some of the lines for others. If you are not used to listening to an Irish brogue you may have to use the shuttle button a few times but the humor is typical Irish and the sound track from the Waterboys is outstanding. Only the Irish can make an entire comedy about a dead guy that won the lottery.
5,"""NED"" is divine!","I have loved this film ever since I saw it in the theater when it was first released. It's so hard to pick my favorite scenes, although the pnone box falling over the cliff was great, not to mention seeing David Kelly riding a motorcycle in the ""all-together"" was pretty hilarious also. I also love the score- I probably listen to it two or three times a week! I heartily reccomend this movie for anyone looking for a feel-good film."
3,One-note plot,"In looking for movies similar to ""Saving Grace"" (very funny, full of interesting characters and an unusual plot), Waking Ned Devine sounded comparable. I was disappointed. Although some of the actors are wonderful (especially Maggie and the pig farmer and David Kelly, as Michael O'Sullivan), their characters are more caricatures and not interesting for adults (more appropriate for kids). The plot was known from the start - so no surprises there. The scenery was beautiful."
2,"Although not horrible, not a movie I would recommend","The premise is great. One person wins the lottery then dies, and a small town shares the winnings. But the movie didn't convince me at all. It lacked the real emotion that in real life it would create. It took to long to get to the point, then once it did, they threw in actions without any story to support them. Such as the woman who was going to turn them in. Why? Just because she was a mean old lady? Ok, but kind of a stretch."
4,Very Interesting,"This was a very good book. I bought the book wanting to learn more about Iraq, but got a lot more. The details of the efforts to launch satellites using a super gun was very interesting and the details of artillery gave me insights I did not have before. I was very interested in the contacts he made, South Africa, Israel, China and Iraq and the fact that the US for the most part created him. There are a good amount of facts that seem well put together. The writing is good and there are a good amount of pictures that really help tell the story. I think it is interesting to read this book and some of the other books about the Iraq process to gather WMD arms - the two would have fit together perfectly. I would have liked the author to focus a bit more on what the purposes the Iraq's were going o use the super gun for. If you are interested in these topics then this book is well worth the time."
1,Try again,Apparently those who can't teach get a vanity press to publish their meanderings; Kuzneski is clearly someone with way too much time on his hands and too few ideas in his head. A pointless exercise; I'm glad I only borrowed a copy.
1,Worst book I have read (didn't finish) this year,"These great reviews must be from author's friends and family; in fact, the cover of the book says it is ""Thriller of the Year"" and you come to find this is a quote from one reader's review on Amazon. Not only is the dialogue horrible, the characters are poorly written and annoying."
2,"Unimaginative, boring","I found this book to be unimaginative, boring and racist. However, I will give him one more try since this was a first try. I figured everything out way before I would have in the hands of a competent story teller.One question. Aren't reviews supposed to be about the book not pompously trying to convince us that the reviewer is the most successful and brillant person alive? -- Rich"
2,Difficult to maintain interest while reading this book.,"I do not like a book where the heroes continually do stupid things just to make the plot develop. For two people who have the training these two supposedly do, they continually bumble about before being rescued, it seems, by accident. This happens on more than one occasion and gets boring after a while. The only reason I purchased the book was that the home base of the protagonists is where I live, and while I had hopes that I could read the entire series, I don't think that I will buy any more of this author's works."
1,Very disappointed,"They advertise this as a case for Palm IIIs when in fact, my Palm IIIe won't fit in it. It clearly states Palm IIIc on the box. I'm returning it today."
2,fair quality,"The quality of the film was only fair. Good to see another film by Whale and with Laughton, Karloff and Massey. Karloff was wasted in basically a bit part. And story by a good writer, Priestly, was only fair, too. Also too spendy for such a short and only fair quality film with no extras.--DJS"
1,Ask about Lead Content before you buy!,"Please be warned that other items from Laura B. contain high levels of Lead. A bedside carafe I ordered from this vendor arrived with a manufacturer's sticker stating that it was 24% Lead Crystal. Do NOT buy it if you are pregnant and most certainly do NOT store liquids in it for long periods of time, as Lead WILL leach into your drinking water."
4,good value,"I bought these as an inexpensive spare pair that I could leave at work which still had decent sound quality, durability, comfort and of course a volume control.They suit their purpose well, tho I don't think they fit on your head all that well - not that they're uncomfortable, but perhaps just not convenient to put on/take off. I have a fairly large head and yet I wear these on the smallest setting. The rubbery band under the top part tends to get caught in my hair as well. They're also very light - which is good for everything except staying in place.For the price they're very adequate, but for fit I would probably go for something with a newer design, like the behind-the-ears style."
4,Pretty good headphones,Not bad headphones..the blue rubber headstrap is a bit uncomfortable and takes some getting used to. For the price $13 these are certainly the best headphones available. I compared them head to head with my Sennheiser PX100's and the Sennheisers are of course better and a bit more comfortable but they cost double the price of these. Go with the Sennheisers if you can justify spending double the money.
4,Very nice sound for the money,"I finally had to replace my 20+ Sony studio headphones and did not want to spend a whole lot of money. I gave these a try and I really lucked out - these are great sounding headphones. My only complaint is a complaint I have on pretty much all headphones under $100. - the cord and connections are thin and cheesy. The Sony headphones I bought back in the day had a nice 10 foot curly telephone type cord that was indestructible. However, for the money these Koss headphones are a solid value."
1,Nice but did not last long at all,These headphones sounded great and were very comfortable but they lasted less than 3 weeks...The wires are not made to last..
3,WRONG Plug!,"When first opened there is a HUGE Straight Plug! This pulls off to reveal a small STRAIGHT plug! I really prefer the performance of the L-Plug as shown, but it's a hassle to return and will give the straight plug a try ONLY because of the reasonable price. If they crap out after a few months I'll update here. But this is a STRAIGHT plug and NOT an L-Plug."
1,Glad they Broke,I thought these were going to be quality headphones when I bought them about six months ago. They are the worst headphones I have ever owned.Uncomfortable doesn't even begin to describe them.I never knew where they were supposed to sit on my head. Terrible sound.Bulky. Ugly.The best thing about these headphones is that they failed after six months.
4,A good buy,"I bought this headphones basically for my iPod touch, which I also bought from Amazon. I don't like the iPod things sticking in and falling out of my ears, as well as the sound quality. I searched for more traditional lightweight headphones at Wally World as well as other retail locations and these seemed to give you far and away the greatest bang for the buck. The silicon type material that keeps the hard plastic from riding on your head takes some getting used to, but the sound quality is awesome. They probably are a little clunky looking if your emphasis would be how cool you look, but for all around usage they cannot be beat, for the quality of the beat."
5,Great headphones,I love these headphones. This is the second pair that I have purchased. I love the comfort gel strap that cushions the headphones. I wore my first one out and bought it again. Well worth the money spent if you like comfortable headphones that don't enclose the ears.
4,Workhorse,"I use these to commute on the bus, train and subway to work and they're great. External noise is sometimes an issue, but I work in NYC so that's to be expected and these are not noise canceling. The in-line volume control is very handy and the cord is longer than most headphones, which is convenient when I need to stash the mp3 player in my backpack and set it down and keep the headphones on my head. I also use them when I watch TV and can turn my head so my ears are on the pillow and not have the earpieces dig into my head."
1,Totally useless for my purposes,"I needed headphones with a RIGHT ANGLE, or ""L"" shaped plug because of space constrictions. I had found a number of headphones which were cheaper with straight plugs but they would not work. I ordered this headphone because not only the picture, but also he printed nomenclature on AMAZON's sale showed and said the headphones came with an ""L"" shaped plug. I paid the extra funds to make sure I got what would fit in my limited space. When the unit came, IT HAS THE STRAIGHT, NOT THE 90 DEGREE OR ""L"" PLUG, making it useless for my purposes. The plug was not visible without opening the packaging and when I did I discovered the plug is a STRAIGHT PLUG, not the ""right angle"" or ""L"" shaped one touted in the picture and also the nomenclature. The packaging was almost destroyed extracting the unit from it, only to find that it was unusable. If you need a ""right angle"" plug do not order this unit."
4,"""The Best for Less""","In my opinion, these 'phones out perform any I've had in the past.They truly are ""The best for less"". You can't beat the value for the price."
2,"Cheap Plastic, Noise in one ear, the jack failed, all in less than 3 months!","This is my first amazon review and I'm compelled to warn people like me not to buy these headphones. I was quite impressed with the sound initially but in less than 2 months, the left ear started to produce conspicuous distortion at low frequencies. Then, there was the jack itself. The jack is not a sturdy L jack as shown in the picture but it is straight. The jack failed a few days back and I have to keep adjusting them every time I move even a little. As for comfort, my ears are still hurting! But maybe it's just for me and not for everybody."
5,Kindle Fire Headphones...,Just bought a second pair for my kindle Fire... It really makes it easy to adjust the volume without having to use the Fire's volume control... And nice quality too.
5,Great Sound For The Money!,"This is my second pair of Koss KTXPRO1 Titanium Portable Headphones and I love them! I destroyed my first pair of seven years as I was getting off of my stationary bike and ripped the right sound cord out of the speaker!The Titanium-coated diaphragm creates wonderful highs without sounding ""tinny"" and pretty decent bass. My only complaint is the ear cushion. If you use your headphones like I do (listening while walking the neighborhood or exercising at home)you should probably buy the extra three-set pack of foam cushions because you'll wear out the original cushions with regular, daily use.I paid $13.86 here at Amazon for this latest pair and thought I was getting a good deal when I bought my original pair at $24.99!They're also very lightweight and (in my opinion) have a much better sound range than most of those expensive, so-called ""pro"" earbuds."
3,"A review on comfort/fit, not sound quality","I purchased this headset to use in a work setting mainly because it has a volume control on the cord, which is easier/faster to adjust. The headset is a bit odd. There is a blue rubber band underneath the actual headband (see the picture). I would assume this is to make it feel more secure on my head. Quite honestly, it still is too big. (And I don't think I have a small head.) It rests too low on my ears. Over a very short period of time, my ears hurt.I like the concept of this headset for a work setting. It just doesn't seem to fit my head."
4,Great for jogging,"I've had these for well over a year now and use them regularly when I go jogging (I wear a headband over them to keep them on). They have held up well and the in-line volume control is a handy feature to have. They are comfortable to wear and produce good sound, plus they are light and airy over the ears, which is why I like to use them when I exercise. I really don't think you can beat them for the price. Keep in mind that they are NOT noise cancellng, which are going to be more expensive and are really best for air travel anyway"
2,Not as good as they should be,"I was trying to replace a pair of Radio Shack Pro 35 headphones, which, supposedly, were made by Koss. The KTX Pro 1 seemed like a fancy upgrade to the RS Pro 35s. But they do not sound as good, particularly in the higher range and they do not fit well! For a an old-line headphone company like Koss to make a headset that does not collapse down enough to fit a normal sized head is just weird - and the reason for my low rating."
5,Koss KTXPRO1,"So far so good with these phones. They sound good with my mp3 players and computer. The volume control is great for drowning out unwanted outside noise. I initially thought the cable wouldn't last too long but it's good also.UPDATE: After using these headphones for over a year now I still have no complaints about them. They sound great, the quality is excellent, and they're comfortable. I can wear them for several hours at a time without feeling like my head absorbed them.I highly recommend these for anyone who needs a decent set of headphones for a reasonable price. You won't be disappointed.Amazon is awesome!"
4,these headphones are great!!,"I've paid 39.00$ for these before and been very content with them.The titanium gives them great sound,esp for an ipod.and they play loud.unfortunately they have a tendency to short out on one side after a few months or less..which is why they are STILL a bargain for the price.you can fall asleep wearing these for comfort at least."
3,"Good sound, cheap construction","I needed a set of headphones for playing bass without disturbing my family. These were cheap enough, and had great reviews, so I ordered them. When they arrived, I was very disappointed to see that the plug is a tiny plastic piece. My son had a pair of Koss headphones with this same plug, and they broke almost immediately. Walmart exchanged them for him the first time, but it happened again a couple of weeks later despite him being very careful with them. These headphones sound very good for the price, but I am going to have to be very careful and not break the plug, which means that they are going to have to stay plugged into my Rockman and I will never be able to use them for anything else. I will not buy another pair of Koss headphones again unless they show a picture of the plug. I'll be surprised if these last 3 months."
3,Sound is good but comfort is so-so,"This product has the best reviews on Amazon of any headphones with volume control. I'm happy with the sound quality and the volume control is great (although a wheel control would have been better than a slider). My main problem is that the foam pads on the ear pieces are too thin. Also, the ear pieces are connected to the head piece at an odd angle which I think makes them more uncomfortable. I can wear the headphones no more than an hour at a time. I can't see why they put the rubber strap on the head piece (maybe for joggers). It was uncomfortable so I cut it off."
2,Disappointing at best...,"Some novels try to mimic the same writing style as Austen, and some novels try to remain true to her plot or characters. This book does neither. The writing is ""hokey"" - I'm sorry I can't come up with a better word for it! While the authors go to great length to explain how they were true to the language of Jane Austen, they miss the mark entirely. Then you have the characters - while the names and places were the same (Mr. Darcy, Lizzy, Pemberley, etc.) there was very little likeness in how they were portrayed, not to mention a see-through plot. If you go into this book with the expectation that it is a stand alone historical romance, then you might not be let down by the final result, but if you are looking for a good follow-up to Janes Austen then don't bother, there are much better books out there!"
1,Atrociously Bad Writing!,"I'm a great fan of Regency writing and without a doubt this book is atrociously bad! Just from the first page alone, one knows that a housekeeper simply does not give such open opinions about the mistress of the house! This is fanciful writing but worse it is also bad writing! The book reads like the worse school girl's novel!"
1,A leaden book lacking the sparkle and wit of the original,"As a Brit, the Americanisms in this book are particularly jarring -- the word ""sweaters"", for instance, leapt off the page. There is also mention of a sleigh ride at Christmas taking place at 4 pm (or 4.30). This would surely have been a hazardous undertaking since at that time of the year in the north of England it would have been quite dark already!"
2,Disappointed,"This is the sencond sequel I have read and I was disappointed. I didn't like this book after the first page when the housekeeper and Georgianna were talking about Lizzy and the houskeeper called her ""Elizabeth"" personally I found that out of period. The language that was used was not reminiscent of the time period and I think some of the conversations in this book were very cheesy. (Like Elizabeth telling Mr. Darcy when she was ill ""...make sure you visit me often for you are my pillar of strength..."" I laughed at that line) The plot was slow moving and the events were pointles. I gave up on it after part one. I found it too boring to finish. Get this from a library before you buy it!"
1,Don't bother,"Simply stated: this book stinks. Now, I realize I didn't read the whole thing, but, frankly, I could not get past the first chapter. It was that bad. Save your time and money."
5,wonderful sequel to Pride and Prejudice,This sequel is by far the best I have read. I am a Pride and Prejudice fan and enjoy the lives of Lizzy and Darcy. This book continues with their life and the life of his devoted sister. It stays true to the characters as no other. I suggest any fan of Pride and Prejudice read this novel. I am sure you will not be disappointed.
1,A Waste of Ink and Paper,"If I could give 0 stars I would. This book is even worse than I was warned it would be. Even if it were not following the masterful Pride & Prejudice I still would consider it poorly written. The plot is ill-formed, the characters are shallow (difficult to do when they've already been created in a previous book), and the grammar is atrocious. Not only were the characters shallow, but they have been changed to the extent that I find it hard to believe the authors ever read Pride & Prejudice! Lizzy has become biddable, Darcy doesn't seem to have respect for her, and Mary is popular and outgoing. It was a painful ordeal to force myself to read it through to the end."
1,Product Does Not Work,"I was not able to wring the water out using the ""easy push down"" plastic. The plastic will not go past the very top of the mop."
5,two deals in one,"It's hard to believe, but we're living in a time where we need both a DVD player and a VCR. We need a DVD player for all the picture-perfect movies available for purchase, and we need a VCR because video stores mainly have tapes for you to rent. With this set, you get the best of both worlds so you can be happy with whichever way you decide to watch a movie. You really can't complain about this product."
2,A Unique Sound For Flora,"This recording, done back in the middle seventies, exemplifies that sound of Michel Colombier's arrangements and piano playing that mixes in perfectly for Flora's vibe attempt here. Her singing is silkier than ever which combines well with the orchestral lines and textures Colombier delivers. The best other aspect of this record (yeah, vinyl) is non other than Jaco Pastorius' bass 'sound'. It's early Jaco and he's simply killin' on the date. He also contributes a gorgeous piece in ""Las Olas"" (The Waves) a bossa that captivates my memories of Rio, Manila, Sao Paolo, Salvador, Bahia coming through the cityscapes of Paris. This is a recording date to check out and enjoy the romanticism with depth it brings to the forefront."
1,Academic Automatonism,Marxian automatonic dead horse beating. Jurgen Habermas is good at showing how Marxism's failures lay in it's Hegelian roots. Marx thought he could adapt Hegel's dialectical teleology minus the spiritual idealism. It's sad that Academia is so out of touch with the people beyond it's Ivory Tower.
4,Good statement on what's wrong on my home planet,"Everyone knows the present state of the free world's economical and cultural 'self-assured-ness' is under-rated and over-simplified. This book spells out our weaknesses before Darth Vader and the Empire, we can only hope that Obewon will return to bring about a new world order."
2,What happened?,"[....]Knowing that Sascha, Raymond, and two Buck Tick members were in on this, you'd think it would be the best album ever made, right? WRONG. Throughout the whole album, I cannot detect a shred of Sascha in it at all. As far as I'm concerned, he might as well have not been included. Lucia also does some vocals on this cd, but they're totally not as impressive as her stuff with MDFMK. This album is a giant let down for me. It has next to no replay value and pretty much contains two songs worth listening to. My advice is to listen to this album before dumping 30+ dollars on it. It might not be what you think it is. It just seems like they threw this album together in one day or something. It doesn't seem focused...pretty aimless. I just want some new KMFDM and Pig already! YEAH! Dump the side projects, Raymond and Sascha, because they're not worth it."
3,"Hope has a home, but the mix hurts.","She may sing of hardship and heartache, but hope also has a home on her hearth. McBride could light a fire under the wettest blanket, and it would still burn brightly. ""Anyway"" is the lighters-in-the-air anthem. But it's songs like ""House of 1,000 Dreams"" that really bring home the heartland emotions that color McBride's landscapes. It's a shame that the overall mix of the album mars the presentation. McBride's vocal is dry and out in front of the band, making it sound like she's singing along to the stereo in your living room -- a private concert, but a bit disconcerting."
5,Great songs,I love Martina McBride. This cds have lots of good songs. It's a must buy for any fan of hers. She's awesome in her concert I just went to a few weeks ago...
1,Wanted to love it but....,"Martina McBride has an amazing, beautiful, strong voice. But I did not like this album at all. It was so formulaic and commercial sounding that it was almost insulting to her audiences' intelligence.There were one or two decent songs but that was about it. Strangely, there was one song that had this upbeat, happy feel, but it was about a very sad, dark subject matter and felt very odd.I love her voice and I'm sure she's a good person with a big heart but I put this one away and won't ever listen to it again.I'll listen to some music samples next time she releases another one."
3,Martina McBride CD,"I love the CD itself; however, when it arrived, the case was cracked horribly and I was afraid the CD might be damaged. The CD is fine, though."
2,Not Anywhere Near As Good As Promised,"Emotion and Evolution were CD's with a bit of an edge to them. Her gutsy rhythm section and the simple guitar work on those albums gave her voice room to soar. I think they were Martina's best work. The single ""Anyway"" promised so much, but from what I am hearing on this album, it sounds very over produced. It has range and polish . . . but no depth . . . sorry all, but I am disappointed.I believe she has gotten too involved in the production."
4,Nice Radio.,"I purchased this for my dad who uses it in a basement sauna. The radio sounds nice and is easy to use, but does need to be positioned a bit for good reception. He is very happy with the radio."
2,Radio Doesn't Hold Up To Long Term Use,"The radio seems good at first but they don't hold up to long-term use in the shower. I've had two of these which have died after several months of use, and am trying a different brand instead."
5,Best on the market,"By far the best waterproof multi-band radio on the market. I am purchasing my second radio only because after nearly several years of abuse from twin teenagers, it finally is starting to wear out. I will not be without one in my bathroom."
5,Great Buy!!,We have purchased many shower radios and this by far is the best. We have only had it a short time but we are hoping that it proves worth the money.
4,great radio!,Love this radio! We leave it in our outdoor shower. It has been through downpours and still works like a charm! All of our favorite stations come in clearly. The only issue is the weather band - we don't have good reception on that. We highly recommend it.
5,Best Shower Radio I've Ever Had!,"I am on my second Sony shower radio (dropped the first one on concrete and it died). The radio is versatile, has great range, and has all the features one could want in a radio of its type. I use it not only in the shower, but anyplace around the house I need a portable radio. I am amazed at the battery life. It goes months on one set of batteries."
3,Excellent Radio - Poor Clock,"This shower radio is attractive, compact and has great sound and station range. It is a 5 for the radio and a 1 for the clock. Unfortunately, the clock is very small and hard to read. I purchased it to place on a small bathroom chest close to the sink, but could not read the digital clock from there. If the radio is placed too high or too low, the small clock numbers are partially shadowed by the clock frame. There is no backlight which adds to the difficulty. I had to place it on the sink vanity right next to where I stand and I still have to bend down slightly to check the time. If having great sound in a shower radio is really what matters to you, this Sony is for you. If you really need a clock in the bathroom, this is not the one for you."
1,Defective,"My unit arrived defective. After installing new batteries, it showed the no battery symbol and was hard to get to turn on. I checked the batteries and all 3 delivered over 1.5v. I can sometimes get it to turn on, but not reliably enough to use. I plan to return it."
2,Died - probably from water,"Worked well, but after about one year it died. I'm guessing water got into it. My daughter used it in her shower, and I'm thinking she allowed it to be directly exposed to the shower."
3,"Nice and solid, but reception weak!","Nice solid radio. Reception was great in every room but the one I needed it for. Was disappointed when the reception in the granite-enclosed shower of the one-window bath did not equal that of its 3-year old $7 odd-lot predecessor. This may not be the best radio for close quarters, but was worth a try. The search continues."
4,Perfect except for strrp,"It's almost a perfect shower radio. I like the digital tuning and the weather channel. Could do without the TV channels, I understand they go away next year anyway. The strap for hanging is the weak area. First it is made of fabric which might not stand up to humidity and water. Second it is a closed loop, a hook would be more useful - a hook goes everywhere a closed loop goes, but a closed loop doesn't go everywhere a hook goes. Lastly the three C batteries will beat AA batteries anyday."
4,Required for a class,"This book was required for a health and fitness class, but I found it kind of simplistic. It covered the material well, but I didnt particularly care for the style."
3,A Good Buy,"This series of books on motorcycles and cars tends to be pretty good for the money. It has color and black and white photos. Ducati in particular is a bike best seen in color, though, and the book could have used more color. The text is short, sweet, and useful. The book will give you a good education and is a worthy addition to your Ducati library."
4,Book Review : First & Only,"First & Only by Dan Abnett is intreguing, action packed, and inventive. Throughout the book if some one fails to read the title of the chapters, he will become lost. In the first eight pages, six people die in a space fight. The book give you little hints as to the final objective but one it is discovered andwen the reader knows what it is, they will finally see the little hints throughout the book. This book uses numberous conficts and battles that keeps the reader intrested. Commisar Gaut, the main character, used his brain to acomplish the goals. When he knew that his company couldn't beat the train from point to point and get ran over, he used his inventivness to get his men saftly and quickly to the core of the enemy. To those who know the Warhammer 40,000 universe, this will please them and they will probably read the entire book before putting it down. For those who don't know the Warhammer 40,000 universe, the book will leave you with suspensful conflict."
1,Two Sisters made me cry,"I found this the dullest DVD I've ever seen. It wasn't sexy, it didn't turn us on, we didn't like it.This nice girl definitively can't act. The only thing you see a thousand times is her two hands starting somewhere around here knees, crawling to the top of her wig and on and on and on.The only - a little bit - sexy thing was Heather coming out of the bathroom on high heels having a little affair with a man who can't act anyway.The colors on this DVD are far too red; unfortunately everything is too red, even the whites. The whole picture is too grainy too.Heather and her sister sit in Marks and Spencer pyama's, weeping and crying; who's the nicest sisters.Later on there's a special interest of one Lisa Dergan who looks better on pictures than acting in some kind of golf game. What's wrong with you guys giving this 5 stars?"
5,Realistic Spider,I wanted a spider that would be so lifelike that it would make people think twice before getting too close. These spiders are real lifelike and possable. They were great! Can't wait to use em next holloween!
5,WOW - Follow-------its that simple.,"McManus has a real gem here. This book really opened up a different view for me. It made me think back to when I first became a follower of Christ (Christian) and how on 'fire' I was for the Lord. How I would stop at nothing to love the Lord and share Him with others-almost Barbaric! Now that I have been a 'Christian' for many years, this book has made me rethink my 'civilized nature' within the church and has me yearning for my old fire back, stopping at nothing to relinquish the Love of Jesus Christ in our world. If you are comfortable in your church now, and in your ways now---read this book! If you are on fire for God and will do anything to ""be safe in the center of the will of God"" read this book! Fresh, inviting, and truely Barbaric!"
5,Excellent call to break the chains of mediocrity,"The Barbarian Way is a spirit inspired book, a call to break away from a mundane and lukewarm faith (if such a faith can even be called faith at all.) It is an appeal to cast away ties and allegiances to a domesticated faith of compromise with the status quo of the Christian culture. Well-written and filled with humor as well as scripture and anecdotes, it is a recommended read for all believers who want to be refined by the refiner's fire."
5,SICK Book,"Any Christian that does not one to live the boring religion being taught in all together too many churches should read this book. This book does not teach a different form of Christianity, it teaches the words in the Bible.Honestly, I do not know what else to say about this book. It is life changing, and just read it.Every Christian man that actually wants to be a Godly man especially needs to read this book."
3,What do you expect?,I think we have all seen the performances that William did and have heard him sing before. Everything on this cd comes as no surprise to me and anyone buying this should know what to expect. I think it's campy fun.
1,Together We Can Take Back The Music Industry,"This is not Funny at all, I don't even own this album and I can still write a bad review for it. The music Industry is corrupt these days, they'll release any garbage for money. Please, don't buy this because it's funny. If you want funny talented music listen to Primus. If you don't buy this, it won't sell Platinum, show the music company that we aren't stupid and we won't settle for this garbage."
5,ahahahahahaha,"seriously, this dude rocks. he can sing better than fantasia and ruben. kelly would kick his ass anytime though. anywho, buy this cd now."
4,Fabulous,"Selling 350,000 is certainly an accomplishment. If you like this, you need to listen to the Shaggs' ""Philosophy of the World""... Tom Cruise has apparently bought the screenplay of the Wiggins Sisters...."
1,Absolutely Awful,This guy has absolutely no talent. How dare anyone compare him to britney. William can barely string sentences together in an interview. I am positive whoever produced this album will lose money because no one seriously cares to buy this album. God I just cannot believe the stupidity. HORRIBLE! Just like Simon would say.
1,America's new low point. i'ts pathetic,i really wish upon some harm onto this one ugly punk. i cannot beleive this guy is taken seriously while there are so many struggling musician's out there. and it's not really his fault.the biggest responsiblity of this low class schmuck loser is the american people. they allow this crap to get popular. hell anyone can be a William Hung Low.i'm sure there is alot of severe haters of this jack ass out there. and i'm hoping they soon do something to get this guy out of the spotlight.shame on u people that actually take this guy seriously. what a loser.i can't give a 0 star rating so i put it the lowest possible. he's more like a -5 stars
1,Painful,"I am glad that some people are amused . . . But sheesh, who could actually LISTEN to this entire CD?The only good thing about this is that William Hung might get enough money out of this to pay for his college education . . . because he is going to NEED it, since a career in singing is just NOT going to happen."
1,I WANT TO SHOOT THIS MAN SO BAD!!!(not literally),"He needs to STOP!! STOP SINGING!! He's made my ears bleed once isn't that enough? He has made me realize what a complete farse (spelling?) the American music industry is. How can an UNTALENTED, UGLY man get a record contract? I am missing no point I know exactly what this man, no thing's, game is- to make money, and if you buy his CD that's exactly what you will be suporting, an UNTALENTED, UGLY man is college."
2,Lordy Lordy,"Well I will give it to you William, you do have some big gonads for making this record. I can't sing any better than you can, but man I give ya props for wanting to put your horribly out of tune voice on the airwaves. I bought this record to add to my array of strange CD's that inhabit my collection. This will be an album where in 20 years I will listen to it (for the second time) and laugh until I cry. I dont know how I can rate this album...words cannot describe the feeling it gives me....happy and overjoyed? No....disgusted and pissed off? No....just utter wonder and awe..."
1,"What? Maybe I'll make an album called ""NO TALENT ASS CLOWN""","Ok truth be known, I haven't bought the album and dont plan to. But I have heard him sing and seen him on AI and one or two other shows.I just have to say, what is this country turning into Girbles? When you can be one of the worst at something and still make it? There are so many people out there who bleed with much more talent than Hung and never make it in the biz, whether it be music, sports, entertainment or anything that involves talent and skill, and many of them are honest just like Hung. I mean its great that he's getting his chance but come on now, a joke is a joke.Bottom line, I don't know how anyone could buy something like this, as I mentioned, maybe I'll make a cd and call it ""No Talent Ass Clown"" just to see how many people would buy it? Seems like Americans are too full of curiosity to realize the difference between parity and a joke."
1,"Yes, not worth of buying, but worth laughing at","Why give a record contract to a 20/21 year old who just don't got it? Geez, I could make a better album than he could. I may not have the ""professional"" voice training, but I sound better than him. The whole world has gone insane with him having the album. We don't care about this guy, but we just don't want him to make another CD. He better realize that he's only ruining his ""career"" in the music biz. If you listen to this guy sing, he will give you a ""HUNGover"" of no-talent/a fork in a grinder noise for a very long time.(...)"
2,revenge of the nerd!,"How can anyone not like or be amused by this guy as a human being?...yes, his album is really bad musically...the tracks are amateurish karaoke, and his voice is not worthy of a singing career...but, we bought it because he's a lovable guy, period!"
4,Inspiration is What Idol Is All About,"If something ever brought to life the irony of the American Idol show, it would be William Hung. William has had more over night success with his humbleness and great attitude, than Clay, Ruben, and Kelly will ever have! The reason this kid has heart, he set out to make music his life and has done a pretty darn good job at it. The singing is not good, and pretty funny. But the fact that he had the [guts] to get on national TV and give it his best shot, gives him the most ""Inspiration""al CD of the year! Great Job Will you give us all hope! Only in America would such a thing happen! The American Spirit is living on once again through William! Have fun with your 15 minutes."
2,The Next Sex Symbol,"This CD has got to be a joke right???This guy makes me laugh and if the CD is meant to be that way, then I'd have to rate it higher, but at the same time, there is only so much you can take by this guy.At least he sounds better than past American Idol ""winners"".How desperate are record companies going to get anyway????"
2,No words can describe this,"Nope, I lied, this is horrible...It reminds me of a drunk chinese man at a karoake bar trying to sing American songs. You're def gonna need a sense of humor for this cd. However, I did enjoy this cd for it's comedy... but that's it. This cd took many of my favorite songs and butchered them in such a way that my ears began to cry. Only buy this cd if you are truly deaf or if you enjoy a little comedy to ""brighten up"" your day."
1,OK LETS GET SERIOUS,"THIS IS WHAT A PERSON WROTEYou should be ashamed of yourselves, April 6, 2004Reviewer: Christine from San Francisco, CAThis poor guy is being exploited while people stand around and laugh. You should be ashamed of yourselves. He seriously thinks he is talented and people appreciate it. Yes, I know he made $$ but still. . . if you're an adult, do not not buy this to encourage teenage behavior.NOW THIS GIRL SAYS THAT(ALL OF US)MAKE FUN OF HIM BUT A NOW HE IS A TARGET BECAUSE OF KOCH RECORDS NOW IF YOU WANT TO BLAME ANYONE BLAME THE RECORD COMPANY THEY ARE AT FAULT.WILLIAM HUNG IS NOT A SINGER HE IS A OFF NOTE NOT IN THE POCKET AMERICAN IDOL WANNA BE.IF YOU WANT TO LAUGH AT BAD MUSIC BUY IT IF NOT DONT WASTE ANY OF YOUR MONEY ON THIS FOOL AND DONT MAKE HIM # 1 ON BILLBOARD CHARTS.HE IS A CHEAP PAWN IN THE MUSIC BUSINESS."
2,What the Hung are people thinking,"First off, I don't get how milions of people can be attracted to a show such as American Idol. The singers aren't that great and they know that they won't be famous for that long if they win. If they were as good as people think, wouldn't they have already been made famous and shouldn't have needed such a show?Well, to Hung, he sucks, I dont think he knows it but he will find out. Slight mental retardation comes to mind when i think of him, and maybe he can use the money he makes off of the cd to fix those messed up teeth. I gave him 2 stars because he is so horrible, it makes me laugh. Everyone seems to think that Hung is some sort of logician, but there are people saying the same things he is everywhere. There are also millions of others who have the same determination as him. Heck, if i could pull of looking stupid and singing as bad as I could, I jump to try to pull off what Hung did. Man this world is full of idiots!!!"
1,WHAT IS THE RECORD BUSINEES COMING TO.,"Just listening to snippets of this I just have to ask WHAT ARE THESE RECORD COMPANIES THINKING? Why would a record company shell out money to record this?? Better yet why would people shell out money to buy this?? People People!! If you want to buy this for comic relief buy it used, say for one dollar. Do not give in to the record companies and buy it new. My hats off to William Hung for having the guts to record this!!"
1,This is the problem with the music industry...,"Lots of good bands out there can't get any deals at all... and yet he does just cuz he's the ""hot"" thing right now... that's the problem with the record industry... they just try to capitalize on jokes like this to rake in teh money....."
1,This is an example of what is wrong with the music industry,"Got to give it to Mr. Hung, he exposed American Idol for the mockery it truly is.AI is more about money than music. Vote for your favorite Karaoke singer and buy a million of his records.Mr. Hung is proof and the music industry is in shambles because of this.If you want to hear real music, go to any local bar and support your local musicians and you will find more sincerity in the music than with Mr. hung or AI.I will say this is one funny album and something tells me it was purposely made that way because no one can sing I Believe I can fly that terribly unless the purposely did it. I give Mr. Hung more credit than that.Buy this album if you want to keep listening to what the music industry wants you to listen to.Until another artist like Nirvana (Kurt Cobain) comes out and shoves all this produced garbage into the trash again."
1,Racist,"This album is racist trash. Hung I'm sure is a nice guy but he is projecting the image of Asian men as fools. Someone said he is living the American dream by making money off this, which goes to show that the American dream is rotten at it's heart."
1,Dreadful!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I listened to this album on AOL listening party yesterday. He ruined alot of good songs. When he sang ""Can you feel the love tonight"" I thought I was gonna get sick. He ruined my favorite song from my favorite childhood movie ""Lion King"". He also ruined the ""Circle of Life"". The rest of this album also sucks, Of course this albums gonna be a sellout because people can't wait to hear this untalented singer after his American Idol audition. His next album will be a flop (if he releases one)."
1,Will sings better than Kurt Cobain? NO!,"Someone who reviewed this album said something like: ""Will sings better than Bob Dylan and Kurt Cobain."" Well I have news for you.-Will doesn't write his own music-Will doesn't play an instrument-Will isn't in a band (it's all synth)-Will sings a lot worse then Bob and Kurt.-Will only does covers of songs that were already written by someone else, and already performed much better.The only reason I can think of for buying this CD is for a frisbee or a 45 minute long joke."
1,"If you like spending money on garbage, this is for you","Simon was correct in his review of Mr. Hung. This guy can't hold a note, or sing in key. If you want a collection of some dudes karoke songs, then this album is for you. You might feel better buying Clay AIken's album if you want someone who can actually sing, but if you want goofy fun and won't feel guilty spending your hard earned cash on it, then support William and his music track collection of bad songs, sung badly, by Hung."
4,I like it,"O.K. This album is pretty funny. But I like it. I don't like it because the songs are wonderful. (They mostly aren't.) I like it because I think William Hung, in a way, is an inspiration. Just because the American Idol judges said no, he didn't give up his dreams of becoming a singer, and look at where he is now! Bottom line: WILLIAM HUNG ENJOYS SINGING. Some of the songs on the CD are actually pretty catchy. So I say, give this CD a try!(P.S. If you don't like my review, let me see YOU try out for American Idol!)"
2,There's a lesson to be learned here.....,"First of all I agree that Hung has but an ounce of vocal talent, but it only goes to show how far someone can go with so little. This album belongs in the comedy section next to Weird Al or Carrot Top. The only difference is Hung does not see himself as a comedian.So many people yearn for their 15 minutes of fame. Well, you can blame Hung for taking up some of your 15 minutes.One thing I actually did like about the album are his personal reflections. He admits he does not have the best voice, but he just plain loves to sing. And (although not evident)he sings with passion and encourages others to do the same without feeling ashamed, to be yourself.If anything was gained from this album, it was a good chuckle, a reminder to go after your dreams no matter the obstacles, and another item to add to the next yard sale ""free"" pile."
1,WHAT?!,"I CAN'T BELIEVE SO MANY PEOPLE BOUGHT THIS STUIPED CD! I LISTEND TO IT ON AOL AND I SAY IT STANK! LOOK, WILLLEM HUNG IS NOT A SINGER,MAN! HE IS JUST A GUY WHO THINKS HE IS A SUPERSTAR. THIS CD DIDN'T EVEN MAKE ME LAUGH. OK, IF A 106 YEAR OLD MAN AUDITONS ON AMERICAN IDOL, ARE THEY GONNA MAKE AN ALBUM FOR HIM TOO?! EVERY SINGLE SONG ON THIS AWFUL CD IS SO BAD! I RATHER LISTEN TO ""GODSPELL"" THAN LISTEN TO THIS CD! I MEAN, COME ON! ARE THERE ACTULLY PEOPLE THAT LIKE THIS OR ARE THEY JUST KIDDING? REALLY, WILLLIEM HUNG CAN NOT SING! HE DIDN'T EVEN MAKE IT TO THE SECOND AUDITION! HE CAN'T SING ROCK, HE CAN'T SING POP, HE CAN'T SING ANYTHING BUT BARNEY! ACTULLY, HE WOULD BE GOOD AT SINGING BARNEY..."
1,Pass the Earplugs!!!!!,"Is this dude serious? Holy cow, I heard this kid was on American Idol, so I was assuming he was another Kelly, Justin, Clay or Ruden...THINK AGAIN! As if doing covers from Ricky Martin wasn't bad enough... he has to go and ruin a perfectly good Elton John song. This guy has no tone, no sense for music, and no rhythm. I woulsn't waste my money with this CD, it's a total joke!"
1,didnt you know this was gonna happen????????,"well theres no 0 star review so let me try to make up a starpeople shouldnt feel bound when it comes to self expression and it gives some inspiration in that sense....i mean....anyone who got cut from american idol or any aspiring artist can say....if william hung can....so can i....lastly, doesnt anyone have the heart to tell this guy how badly he sucks...talk about needing a reality check....next thing you know william hung will be working with jammy jam or rick rubin lolps..i havent listened this cd"
1,The joke is over....,"When the William Hung phenomenon begain it was interesting to follow b/c in a way many people felt it was ""cool"" or ""hip"" to cheer for someone who was the total opposite of an American Idol. Who hasnt cheered for the under dog? But that ""coolness"" has faded and the man has become truly annoying. There are no words to describe just how awful this CD is. Well at least he has that civil engineering degree to fall back on..."
1,The World has gone nuts,"This guy thinks he can sing, well he is dreaming. I am alot better than William Hung. He doesn't sound good when he tries to hit the high notes. He murders every song he sings."
1,No talent,I know a lot of people who suck and William Hung is one of them. Talk about a no-talent ass clown.
3,This is what it reprints,"It reprints all of the Neal Adams stories in chronological order. Volume #1 includes reprints of Batman #200,203,210, Brave and the Bold #75,76,79-85, Detective Comics #370,372,385,389,391,392, and World's Finest #174-176,178-180,182-183,185,186."
2,okay,"This book is a little difficult to follow. The editoral review said that you only need some familiarity with excel but I found this to not be the case. You will need to be at least at the intermediate level with excel to follow some of the examples and many of the problems in the book. Some examples are unclear and no answers are given to the questions. However if you are able to follow the book, the practical applications will be benefical to managers.- Even though there are better applications than excel that managers can use."
5,The Power of Positive Persuasion!,"I have always enjoyed Napolean Hill's books. This man knew how to write in a a manner that compelled you to take action.Succeed and Grow Rich Through Persuasion is a must read for everyone, but especially salespeople. Teachers, parents, husbands and wives will find this book makes them more persuasive in all of their dealings. Although this book has ten chapters, I found the chapters on The Persuasive Personality, Prerequisites to Power and The manual for master salesmanshipparticularly noteworthy.Someof the other information does reat from Think & Grow Rich but that didn't stop me from picking up a new idea or two this time around.Get this book and learn The Power of Positve Persuasion. Also recomend Brian Tracy's ""Advanced Selling Strategies.""Tracy is a modern day version of Hill."
4,Convenience Pocket Reference,It is very good & convenience pocket reference book for Objective-C programming particular for new Objective-C programmer.
4,Great for beginners.,"I saw that these book were using by exam prep centers and schools.Then I got book and study with it.I could say that it is great explaination,prep to exam for everyone.Hey I pass test,why you don't.just grab book and study very carefully.. ABBAS KULOGLU"
5,healthpays.freelife.com,...This amazing book by Dr. Earl Mindell is the all-time bestseller for nutritionals. Dr. Mindell has taught the world that wellness and prevention are truly possible with nutritional supplements. What you read here will amaze you!
3,Too much muscle needed in the wrong place,"I love the jumper - but there are two things I would change:1. Putting this thing together was a real job! Simple, yes. But you'd better have a steel grip to get those seat rings into place (""no tools required"").2. The spring loaded clamp could fit more snugly onto the wall at the top. (no it's not hanging on a narrow wall - standard size) In other words, it could be *more* spring loaded.Otherwise, great toy. My son has super strong legs and at almost 4 months, he's been ready for this jumper for a month at least - he's going to love it!"
1,"PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS!!!","I do not own one of these myself, but my sister does. She had never used it until we went down to visit her. We placed my 6 month old daughter into the jumper and waited to see if she would like it. At first she was trying to get used to it...as soon as she got the hang of it and started to enjoy it, the seat unlatched itself from the hooks...it happened so unbelievable quick...the next thing i know my daughter is screaming and crying at the top of her lungs...she'd fallen through the base (with the seat still around her bottom) and hit her head on a sharp corner of the door frame...luckily...she wasn't seriously injured...but I can only imagine the dangerous possibilities...the engineering of this toy is rather stupid...please...for the sake of your child...don't buy this...it doesn't even deserve one star!!!"
4,"Fun for baby, and for us to watch!","My son is now 6 mos. old and he absolutely LOVES this jumper. We have a lot of laughs watching him go. It's so easy to install (note-- you must have moldings on your door frames or the clamp will slide off) -- the only drawback is that adjusting the straps up and down (to accommodate a growing baby) are a little difficult to figure out-- the directions don't help much. I do agree with the comments that this works better in a wide doorway-- we use in a very large passage between our kitchen and living room; I cannot imagine using in a regular door way as my baby likes to swing around too much. Also, this works better when baby is a little older. When he was smaller, we had to wedge a small stuffed toy behind him, and we had to stay next to him because he would start to slide to one side. Now at 6 months, he can hold his own. The biggest drawback? He now loves to jump so much that whenever his feet touch the ground, our lap, etc. he starts to laugh and jump!"
4,Daughter Loved it...Mom alittle Scared!,My daughter could spend more than an hour in this one!!! I ofcourse being her mom always worried and never took my eyes off of her in it...I was afraid it would fall down-- It never did. We even have pictures of her falling asleep in it. She would tire herself out. As far as the woman saying that the seat fell out well...I would have to say that the seat was not put on properly. That seat took some time and effort to put in. I can not see any other way it coming off unless in was not put on the right way.
5,Precious! A Christmas Classic,"What a joy to find a precious book about Christmas that actually has some deeper value, more than the fading tinsel on the Christmas tree. Wonderful!"
5,To be Episcopalian,This is a tiny volume with a single paragraph or sentence per page. Each page states someone's reason for being Episcopalian. Excellent resource for people considering becoming Episcopalian and for evangelism committies.
5,And they're low carb too!,"Nice cookie. Much like a ""tea"" cookie. Not too sweet. Very low carb. Highly recommended. Children love them, adults do too."
5,Quest for the ultimate ginger cookie,"Anna's Thin Ginger cookies top my list in search of the absolute BEST! I'm very pleased with my ""double order"" of Anna's cookies from Amazon--which I must confess are just about half gone. I'll definately look to Amazon for futher orders of Anna's Thin Ginger cookies. Because I was so delighted with the first box of cookies I tried, I wrote to the email address on the box requesting the name of markets in this area. The reply I recieved from the staff at Anna's in B.C. told me about Amazon. Many Thanks for this amazing treat. I would highly recommend it to anyone. I especially love these cookies with Marzcapone (Italian cream cheese)."
1,David Darling Cello,"I love David Darling's ""Eight String Religion. It moves me and is uplifting every time I listen to it, but ""Cello"" is very, very dark and depressing. Don't go near it."
2,tiny bone,"dog went crazy as soon as she smelled the bone, and she absolutely enjoyed the flavor - however it was so tiny she could finish it in a single bite. i expected it to be much larger and was disappointed."
1,Would be mildly amusing if published as fiction,"Ben Cheever delights in toying around in the real world. I wish he would have had his little adventure then written a novel about it. It would make good light reading; a shallow tale of an immature spoiled rich kid in middle age that flirts with the dangerous real world and how he comes back none-the-wiser. By his admission it is an ersatz adventure. He feigns risk, hoping to enlighten us. Yet Cheever thinks he can ride the roller coaster and describe what its like to climb Mt. Everest. Why else would he publish it as non-fiction? If you have the desire to learn how difficult it is to live as a low-wage employee read Barbera Ehrenrich's ""Nicked and Dimed."""
1,"This is a bad, boring book","This was a book that didn't need to be written and it is unfortunate that I wasted my time reading it. If it takes a day or less to train for a job, then you are going to be underpaid. If the highest qualification needed is passing the drug test, then you are going to be underpaid. The writer had to go undercover to figure that out? Maybe for his next book the writer will go undercover to the first grade to explain to us that while the first graders found the material challenging and thought provoking, he found it easy and beneath him. Skip this book and read ""Nickel and Dimed"" or ""The Working Poor""."
4,"Not bad, just not great","The show was great up until the very very end of the series (both very's are implied, not a mess up). If the ending were different, I would probably give it a 5 star rating, but that was like ""What were you thinking?!"" I still prefer this ending over Neon Genesis Evangelion's ending, that one just made no sense,, this one made sense, but it was an annoying ending."
5,Must-read for all Americans,"Don't start reading this book late at night because you won't be able to put it down until you're finished.I read the 1989 edition and I was surprised by the number of people in it who are still active in government. This book explained a lot to me about how we got where we are today. For instance, civil servants caught spying for Israel simply come back into government at high levels. It makes you wonder how Pollard ever wound up in jail.The index of the new edition lists Sami Al-Arian so it looks like the book has been updated.I'm buying it."
4,Fantastic starter HTS product,"The clarity is amazing for a low cost system. Yes, the other reviews are correct about the lack of RCA inputs on this product. But, included is a coax cable for your DVD player which still leaves both RCA jacks available. I ran one to my TiVo to take care of the Video and still have one available to run to my TV for my PS2 or CD Player. There is a max volume level to prevent someone from blowing the sub/speakers and it's just as clear as low volume listening."
2,"terrible sound, but maybe mine was defective","I bought this as a gift, and believe me when I say it was a terrible disappointment when I set it up and found that the sound coming out of the center and surround channels (but not the front channels) was completely mangled by the receiver. I tried everything, but no matter what, CDs played in Pro Logic and Dolby Digitial encoded DVDs sounded awful. Strangely, if I played CDs or DVDs in stereo, it sounded great, so I believe there was something wrong with the surround channel amplifiers."
1,The worst bottle ever!!!!!! Leaks like crazy!!!,"The bottle does nothing but leaks all over my daughter face, neck, clothes, blankets, bib and everything. I read the instructions left and right to make sure I'm doing it right.My husband bought the most expensives bottle for our daughter after doing so extensive research thinking it was the best for her; however it was all a lie; our daughter doesn't get enough milk because she was wearing most of the time. No wonder she wasn't gaining any weight. AVENT BOTTLE THE WORST BOTTLE DESIGN EVER!!! My husband end up buying the cheapest bottle and it work the best. Even the hospital nipple work too"
1,GASSY BABY!,These bottles gave my newborn so much gas. He would keep us up at night crying because of the gas pain. You can actually HEAR and SEE the air going into the bottle and mixing with the liquid. My mother in law was rubbing my son's belly and she could actually FEEL the bubbles in his little tummy! DON'T BUY THESE BOTTLES!
5,Great starter set!,"My six month old daughter has been using this bottle since she was seven weeks old. I found that the bottle leaked when I screwed the cap on too tightly. My daughter easily latched on to the nipples making the transition to bottle feeding easy. Overall, this product among other Avent products have been great and I highly recommend them. I also used and liked the Avent on the go pump."
2,Sucky bottles,"These bottles are the worst I've ever seen. My son could not get latched on correctly, the nipples were too small, and then when he drank from them it went down way to quickly. And why should a bottle be so complicated that you have to either hold it just right or screw the lid on just right, not to tight you know. Who wants to mess with that in the middle of the night. We switched to the playtex natural latch and everything was much better. Yes you have the bags, but there is no leaking and no extra air. I only use these bottle with my pump and even then they are a pain in the butt, because they don't want to stay screwed to the pump. ERRR!! Very frustrating."
2,not happy,"I bought a bunch of these bottle before I had my daughter, thinking these would be the best bottles as per mostly all my friends encourages me to get(no gassy babies with this bottle). However, i noticed after a few weeks of breastfeeding more often (i mixed fed my baby when she was born, 60% bottle/40% breastmilk, i was still on the stage of learning to breastfeed that's why she had a lot of bottle feeding that time) my daughter wouldn't latch on to the nipple (my milk wasn't enough, need the bottle occasionally), my daughter find the nipple too firm, it doesn't feel like my breast. I checked another brand(a lot softer nipple), and it works well for her. I am still hoping she'll be able to use them once she get older though (there's a bunch of them, it would be a big waste if she won't). So (...), buy a couple of different bottles and see which one your newborn prefers. Yes, babies are very picky about the nipples."
2,Leaky and loud,"I do not like these bottles at all! I registered for this set after hearing how great these bottles are. Like anotber poster said, they leak if you don't get the nipple and ring on JUST RIGHT and have soaked my son many times. I also find it frustrating to have to break the suction all the time because the bottle makes a loud squeaking noise. Totally annoying and not very soothing for those middle of the night feeds when you are trying to keep the baby as relaxed as possible. Get the playtex nurser system instead--they are 100% better!!!"
1,HORRIBLE!!!!,My newborn son hated these! The nipples were to hard for him and he had alot of spit up with these! Not good for a colic baby eventhough they advertise to reduce colic. He wasn't pleased with them at all and neither was I. I recommend Dr. Browns they have very soft nipples and reduced the amount of colic and he no longer has spit up!!! It costs just the same too but it has many parts to the bottle but who cares about your own convenience whats more important is that the baby eats without getting fussy right? He enjoys feeding time now and finishes his bottles all the time with Dr. Browns. If spending the money is an issue go to the store and buy Evenflo Comfi he liked those too but the nipple was a problem again so I bought extra Dr Brown nipples.
5,Baby Bottles,"I give 5 stars to all Avent Products. I have had no problems, whatsoever, with Avent. A must have for all new Mothers!"
1,don't do it!,"We tried these because of all the hype about how they ""support breastfeeding."" If that means that your child will hate the Avent nipple so much that s/he will clamor back to the breast, then I agree. If, on the other hand, you actually expect your child to eat from the bottle, get something else. My daughter hated the nipple shape (it actually gagged her), and got incredibly frustrated with the newborn (1-hole) nipple. We tried the 2-hole, and could at least get some food down her with it, but she still gagged and fought. Then we tried a Dr. Brown's with a Level 1 nipple, and had a happy, full baby. We have a pile of Avent bottles and nipples sitting in a bag in the closet if you want them!"
3,Not the best product,"I bought a bunch of these bottle before I had my son, thinking these would be the best bottles. However, my son wouldn't latch on to the nipple. I breast fed for the first 4 mos. and only needed the bottle for occasional use. I ended up using the ready to go bottles of formula that you just attatch a nipple to. He loved these. After a while, (about 9 mos.) I tried to use the avent bottle again and he liked it. Its the perfect size for when they learn to hold the bottle temselves. However, they do leak. Not all of the time, just occasionally. My advise is not to buy a whole bunch of any bottle before having a baby- buy a couple of different bottles and see which one your newborn prefers. They are very picky about the nipples."
1,Frustrating,I chose these bottles admittedly because it's a well known brand. However upon using these bottles I became increasingly frustrated with leaking issues. The caps leak frequently and waste the formula that should be ingested by my baby. It also appeared to create gas which made her miserable. I would never buy Advent again.
1,misleading,"When I had Eli - everyone was recommending avent - avent - avent. So, that is what I registered for and was using, until... 2 1/2 months and Eli and I had to spend a week in the hospital. The nurses there told us that avent's nipple is the most difficult nipple to suck from - it was way too hard for Eli to suck from. We found evenflo worked best for us. So, I recommend before investing in a lot of one type of bottle, test out a few and find out what works best for your child."
4,"Business students who want simple ""why"" & ""how"" of technic",A business student interested in multivariate techniques seeks a book on regression and ANOVA that does not have involved/advanced mathematics. This book is an answer to that.An earlier edition emphasised the Behavioural Sciences. I expect that this edition attempts to speak to a wider audience
5,"""DOC"" is an awesome show to watch","I have to agree over 100% with all the other reviewers that this DOC show is a wonderful, heart warming show. I enjoyed it immensely and I am waiting for all the shows to show up on DVD and it will definitely be my collection.I am very happy that ""I"" has televised this show.Dr. Clinton, Nurse Nancy and all the cast of the show not to forget Tippy, thank you so much. Raoul is adorable!! I wish you all a wonderful life and career. God bless you all! I will surely miss the show and hope the DVDs will come soon. Paula K."
2,You get what you pay for,I bought this Violin for my 5 year old. The quality of the bow is pathetic; the hair just won't get tight enough to tune the base to a reasonable range. I am not impressed to say the least.
5,stuffed peppers,I sm always on the search for a stuffed pepper recipe. The cover of this book enticed me to make it. It was really easy. I only omited the purple onions that go on the bottom of the peppers. This dish was easy to make. Tasted really good!!! Will be making it again! For me this recipe is a keeper!!!
5,great product,Great kick bag. I have a 7 year old in Taekwondo and this is perfect for him to practice. Easy to adjust height. It also keeps my 5 year old busy :) It arrived in perfect condition and before the projected delivery date. The box was the first toy my boys played with on christmas day!
4,great purchase,We bought the bag for our son. He is only 3 so we didn't want to get anything too expensive. The bag is nice but we didn't really like the material that it is made out of. In the picture it looks like the cover is a leather type material but it's actually more of a nylon material. It's really not that big of a deal. It's still perfect for him to practice his karate. Shipping was incredibly fast.
4,I'm sad if I missed the hardcover edition....,"This is a beautiful compilation of fine art nudes. The book includes all forms of photoart both in color and monochrome.The size is good and the book has 224 pages. The only saddening things are that, at least the second edition is paperback. This work merits hardcover, and personally I rank paperbacks as paperbacks and hard covers as books. This paperback has bound pages so it can handle normal use...the library life is shorter though.The lack of bibliography regarding the photographers (names are listed, with gallery etc addresses, but that's all) is also something that catches the eye."
5,Loved it.,Another great book in the Apprentice Adept series. You won't be disappointed. I highly recommend all books by Piers Anthony. I have not read one of his yet that I didn't like.
1,"Yeowww Catnip Bags, 1/2 Ounce",I was extremely disappointed in this product. My cat hardly took a second look at it. Don't know if it is too old and lacking in scent or not but a total waste of money.
3,Not crazy about the lighting,"I was never crazy about the lightning effect on this figure. It's not that noticeable even when you press the button to light it up. More importantly, it's not blue. Also, the figure has trouble standing up off it's base. I'd instead recommend some of the newer Palpatine figures have blue plastic ""lightning"" that actually looks more realistic."
4,Infectious Rhythmic Beauty,This is one of those magic combinations of some of the world's most enchanting sounds. A must have for jazz and world music lovers alike.
4,Really Works!,"This mask will keep water out like a champ! The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is that if you aren't careful you can create too much suction inside the mask. After one swim I had a burst capillary in my eye... ugly but it went away in a couple of days... and I think it was because at one point I had so much suction in the mask it actually hurt and made my eyes feel like they were popping out. I let some air in and it felt a lot more comfortable, but when I got home later I saw that I had a bloodly eye. First time I had ever had one and it was kind of shocking, but ultimately just cosmetic. I think the packaging should mention the correct way to use the product so you don't over-suction your eyes, esp for those like me who want to use this for swimming in contact lenses. The tinted lenses are fantastic and really nice quality for the price!"
3,"Lenses stained after only 3 years, unusable.","I owned a pair for three years. Then I noticed it was becoming more difficult to see through. I removed the lens in hopes of cleaning somehow and was surprised to discover these are actually made up of two lenses, the inner dark lens and the outer mirrored lens. They are not sealed to each other. I discovered what I assume to be pool chlorine that had become trapped between the two lenses and ate away at the plastic surfaces. Also what appeared to be a thin plastic film on the dark lens had begun to peel away. Ruined! Incorrect pool/chemical treatment? Can't say. I don't recall the literature ever saying I had to disassemble (didn't know they could be) and clean them on a regular basis. Until this problem arose, they really were fantastic, fit wise and vision wise. I might try another pair now that I am aware of this problem."
1,So-so,"I liked Vincent Price's reading of The Christmas Carol, and if it had been just that, I'd probably give it 5 stars. But the acting of the scenes with Scrooge is just plain bad, and Marley is a joke. At first I thought it would be too short, but I was glad I didn't have to sit through a long version with the horrible acting."
5,You've gotta read this..,I've read over 60 Fear Street books & this one is my favorite. I love the whole cheerleader series its probably one of the most scariest series R.L. Stine has ever written do take my advice & read it!
3,This Book...,"I have read many of R.L. Stine's books, mostly the Goosebumps series. I recently began reading the Fear Street books, and I loved them. This one is the only one I've read that involves something unrealistic, a ghost. All the other ones (I have read) could happen which made me love the series even more. But when I read this one I was very disappointed. R.L. Stine, keep the ghosts to Goosebumps!"
1,misterwatch,They are a horrible company they don't send your purchase to you like they promise to. I have been waiting for several days after the time I was told my watches would ship out by and they still haven't shipped them. I ordered merchandise for my anniversary and was promised by them that they would be sent out in plenty of time. They have lied to me day after day. I would avoid them like the plague. You will never recieve them by any kind of date. For we are still waiting. They are quick to take the money but slow as ever to send out the merchandise.
4,A personal arcana,"Waite, like Crowley, was of a time and place that is not entirely of a ""universal"" appeal or intelligence. He, like his contempories, often strives to be obscure and arcane even when he claims that his goal is clarity. This book, however, is a classic of both tarot and self-help and has lessons that transcend time and words. His elitism is unappealing today but his feeling for the age old feelings of sense and self are beyond reproach. To study Tarot without Waite, is to study mind without Freud. This is a book to enjoy, savor, and question."
5,A Good Deck for Beginners,"This is a good deck to start with before your skill level rises to where you want to chose another ""more exotic"" deck."
2,Card tops different color.,Slick cards. Magician too smart. Card size can be a stingent smaller. The designs have some flaws. Few cards are slightly the same.
2,Not as Advertised,"The person to whom I had this item shipped reported to me that one of the cards was missing (the Tower card) and the instruction book was not included, as advertised."
3,CARDS,The cards were too small and the descriptions in the box did not match the info from the website. Overall not bad.
2,Pocket rider tarot deck,This a simple rather bland tarot deck perfect for non-professional readers or those not really serious about using the tarot.
1,Rider-waite Tarot Deck,"I was a little disappointed with the quality of this item. They seemed to be cheaply mass produced but, they would work for a beginner. To be honest though I may have been spoiled by the fact that I have a 1972 vintage set of Rider-waite cards and the quality is much better."
3,"Decent, but there are many better books out there.","Greenwald is a horrendously dry, boring, and confusing author to read. This book isn't meant to be entertainment, but educational; but his writing style practically ensures you will have a horrible time reading this.The first half of the book presents the authors theories of securities analysis. He gives several ""case studies"", but they offer little help in real-world application once you have put the book down. The ideas given in here are coated in Graham-esque language and philosophy, but at the core it is the author's flimsy and not entirely well-thought out theories which are rooted in the efficient market hypothesis. Some of the things he says are correct, but the whole idea leaves you with several, ""yea, but..."" sort of questions.The second half of the book presents mini-biographies of a few well-known ""value investors"". These have some merit, but you can find better ones elsewhere."
3,Charmed,"If you're looking for charismatic music, this CD is for you. The bell sounds are great. This CD is slow moving, but definately capturing."
2,Ok......Thats it?,WOW this isnt too good i mean who want to play PAINTBALL A WOODLAND SPORT in a shaceship? that the whole idea of the game...WOw. not to many weapons either. If your lookinf for a paintball game get high impact paintball it is WAY better than this. No one even has the time to create a REAL paintball game. There are no paintball games out there that are really good but hopefully someday one will come out before i die. So dont get this game. he graphics are good but the gameplay isnt. The best graphics in the world dosent make a good game.(think wolf3-d)
1,Worst Experience,"After using it for 15 mins, there was no sound from the left side of the headphones.Moral of the story: Delicate and unreliable"
1,A Good Old Fashioned Future is really bad...,"(I actually rate this collection a minus 5; but the Amazonians won't allow that with their current rating system.) Anyway...This collection of Sterling's old scifi mag short stories really blows! (Can I say that on national webspace?) Ahoy there, Maties! Know ye that B. Sterling's work is now becoming increasingly more inarticulate, obscure and esoteric in this latest collection of eurotrashy-eurotragic cyberpunk swill. Yuk! He was lots funnier and interesting in his earlier collection of stories; but this latest collection, half of which are incomplete and meaningless stories, is pure manure: eclectic, dielectric, and stupid. Time to pull my pants back on and leave this party!"
1,A waste of time,"Lots of clunky sentences here (good English is not Mr. Sterling's forte). I couldn't find anything of value in this snore-a-rama. The ideas were vapid, the scope limited. This book may have been about the future, but it belonged in the Good Old-Fashioned Dustbin of the Past."
3,NOT DONE YET,NOT PUT TOGETHER AS OF YET PARTS MISSING WHICH WE ARE WAITING ONWILL LET YOU KNOW MORE AFTER PARTS GET HERE WE HOPE TO GET THEM ANY WAYED
3,Erotic Horror,"I grew up with horror, and a lot of why I liked it was the sex and violence. This one features some of the best girl on girl scenes in a regular movie with full tongue kisses and some sucking. Not really a guilty pleasure but definately devoid of very much technical merit like most films of its kind, but it does include realistic black magic rituals. But it should've had Linda Blair nude. All in all, an enjoyable erotic horror film."
2,Not great acting; but great eroticism action,"The movie has the usual amateurish acting of Eddie Albert, Jr and not much from Linda Blair but the erotic scenes are very ""arousing"". The ""three way"" scene and some lesbian dream sequences are actually done well from a ""soft porn"" point of view. The story line has potential but it appears that it was edited quite a bit"
3,"ok, for a molded cable","by the looks of these cables they are ok... not as flexable as i wanted, these cables are for more or less digital audio... not analog direct audio interconnections..."
2,Below Average Sound Quality,"I wasn't happy with this cable, perhaps it is a lack of synergy in my system, but I noticed issues right off the bat. Dynamics were compressed and flat sounding, details were smeared, bass had a poofy quality to it that was sort of pleasing on some acoustic recordings. On the whole the cable was decent with simple acoustic recordings and got especially bad the more complex the music got. The build quality is pretty low as well, it's a bit cheap feeling, kind of stiff and plasticy.After about 2 weeks I switched to another model from Cables To Go, the 18ft ""SonicWave"" S/PDIF cable and I have found it to be superior to this one. On sale the SonicWave was only $8 more...Cables To Go 29726 SonicWave Digital Audio Cable (18 Feet, Charcoal)"
2,"It's okay, but it doesn't top the original","When I saw that 12 Angry Men had been remade with Jack Lemmon, I was very interested in seeing it. Not only do I like Jack Lemmon, but I wanted to see if more of a modern twist had been placed on the story. I finally saw the movie, and I must say that the other reviewers are correct. This version, while somewhat interesting, doesn't hold a candle to the original. Jack Lemmon looks tired and sulks a lot, and he just doesn't have the energy that made Peter Fonda such a great fit for the role in the original. George C. Scott does a nice job in his angry role. The great Ossie Davis has his talents wasted in a minor role. Tony Danza and James Gandolfini perform nicely, but in the end the original beats this one hands-down. Modernizing it didn't do much for the dialogue, the story, or the performances. Skip this and buy the original."
1,Futile anachronistic remake,"that just seems dull, dimwitted and hoplessly dated. The original was a landmark film, though still very much of its era, but the remake works about as well as a strawberry pizza."
4,Cute,"This is cute I bought it for my nephew and he likes it. It is very durable but there is not much to it, I wouldn't expect hours of play from it. After seeing it I think it is worth paying about $7 for, which is unfortunately less than what I payed."
3,It's avrage,"Tony Hawk Pro Skater was better, and so was the sceond. I don't recomend bying this game for skateboarding fans, I'd rather stick to Tony Hawks Pro Skater 2."
4,Very handy and practical,"I took this unit with me to Central America and found it to be amazingly accurate. It performed ""forecasting"" at least as accurate as the local weather guys on TV. I found it to be very handy and practical. It allowed me to see what the current temperature and humidity was in several different micro-climates. It was nice to have the time and date displayed also so my journal keeping was accurate. The only thing missing was an anemometer!"
5,K&N 57-3025-1 Fuel Injection Performance Kit Gen2 Air Intake Kit,"I HAVE A 4 CYLINDER, 5 SPEED CHEVY S10. HOPING TO INCREASE POWER , I BOUGHT THIS K&N COLD AIR INTAKE. FOR SOMEONE WITH MODERATE ABILITY, INSTALLATION WAS O.K. THERE WAS MORE INVOLVED IN REMOVING THE FACTORY INTAKE EQUIPMENT THAN INSTALLING THE NEW INTAKE. WHEN YOU REMOVE THE OLD STUFF WITH ALL OF THE CHAMBERS AND BOXES THE AIR HAS TO PASS THROUGH IT IS EASY TO SEE WHY THE K&N WITH ITS VERY DIRECT INTAKE APPARATUS WOULD PROVIDE BETTER PERFORMANCE AND ECONOMY. I AM GETTING A MILE TO 2 MILES PER GALLON BETTER ECONOMY AND THE INCREASE IN PERFORMANCE IS NOTICEABLE ESPECIALLY AT THE TOP END OF EACH SHIFT. THE PLEASANT ""GROWL"" DURING EACH SHIFT IS ALSO COOL. ALSO, YOU ARE ADVISED TO LISTEN FOR HISSES OR BUZZES COMING FROM THE INTAKE BUT I HAD NO ISSUES WITH THIS. I FIND THIS INTAKE TO BE AN INEXPENSIVE, EASY WAY TO INCREASE PERFORMANCE AND ECONOMY."
5,"Organized, well written, concise","We found a very inexpensive hotel in the heart of Manhattan. We were a little nervous until we arrived and found the hotel to be clean, friendly and best of all - cheap! We did not have to give up any of the amenities we usually have in hotels to have an inexpensive room. He had sections of the city divided up and it was easy to follow."
4,"Herny, I Want Your Job.","Seriously. The only reason this cd gets only four stars is because of the sound quality. Mr. Rollins is one helluva storyteller, and he's got lots of tales to spin... after you've listened to this or any of his other spoken word stuff, you'll feel as though you know the guy. and you'll probably want his job, too. this stuff will make you laugh, and then he hits you with something that makes you ponder existence... quite remarkable. always remember... Henry is an optimist, but his optimism ""wears heavy boots and is loud""."
2,Disappointed,I was disappointed with this book. In my opinion it was poorly written. I usually re-read my books after a few years but I won't be re-reading this one.
1,this game is horrible!!,"ugg. what a huge waste of money! as a lover of the sims, i bought this game hoping for some more fun, i love to run things, when i got this, i found it to be an absolute failure of a game! i couldn't understand how to do anything! i couldn't even figure out how do buy a plot of land! the graphics are not good, and heres a piece of advice, i know it's more expensive but just go and buy the sims. it would be a much better investment in hard earned money then this hunk of trach."
