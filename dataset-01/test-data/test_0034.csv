5,Great Guide for VAs and Small Companies,"I just had to write and say that I love this book! I already own a home business, and I actually figured this guide might help me find resources for locating a VA, since it's known as ""the"" resource for virtual assistants. And wow, not only did I get a ton of great resources, but I learned so much that I could apply to my own business. (Loved the coaching tips!)Virtual Assistant, The Series is simply chock full of everything you would ever want to know about starting a virtual assistant business - learning the skills, contracts and forms needed, the day by day expectations of a VA, plenty of niche services to explore, resources on starting a VA site, even collection tips. It also has a great list of resources that can help those of us looking for a VA find someone great.If you want to start a VA business (or any service business for that matter) or want to add those services to your current business, you are definitely going to want this guide!"
1,Not the LOEB version!,"I bought this expecting it was the LOEB in mobi form, but it was a completely different translation with no Latin. If you just want a translation this one will work, but there is no Latin text."
5,Mom of two,"My husband and I took our 6 year old and our 2 1/2 year old to this movie. We really enjoyed it! Each of my children enjoyed ""Brother Bear"" at their own level of understanding. My husband and I even got a bit emotional during certain parts of the movie. I purchased the CD for my children soon after and they have been listening to it frequently. We even made a copy for my son's teacher, so that his class can listen to the soundtrack. We hope that Disney will do more movies like ""Brother Bear."""
5,Sid Burns,I ordered this movie and Brother Bear II for my 4 year old son. We use it during family time. Both of my kids love it. I had never even heard of it until my co-worker introduced me to it. Excellent movie. Thanks for your help.
5,A Touching Story About Life's Lessons and Love for Family,"I really enjoyed this movie. I did not see it in theatres but truly wish I had. Brother Bear is wonderfully directed and really delightful. And for anyone not too afraid to show their soft side, this is a tear jerker.Why not learn something and have some fun at the same time. A well done children's movie and something for the whole family to enjoy!"
3,Maybe not for younger folks,"I bought this for my grandchildren 1 1/2 and 5 1/2. They were not taken with the movie, and were actually somewhat concerned by some of the scenes. The cartooning becomes very serious and facial expressions of fear and anger appear often; especially in the beginning and ending portions. The plot was a little abstract even for the older child, who is a Star Wars fan but didn't much get this movie. It's not a movie I would have purchased for them if I had seen anything other than the cute middle section moose spots they advertised on TV. I finally turned it off because I worried about nightmares since it seemed there were more confrontational parts than fun parts. Just not what I was expecting, and I was disappointed because I was looking for some light entertainment and fun for them."
5,Better than most of the recent Disney fare,"For once, the Mouse has done something right. After the typical butcherings of classic tales (Hunchback, anyone?) and the endless dribble of mindless, plotless, pointless sequels, Brother Bear is a breath of fresh air.The theme of walking in another's shoes is handled well-- not hammered obnoxiously into your skull by way of song, nor buried by the comic releif. And the songs themselves are upbeat without being sugary. And for once we are not subjected to an obligatory romantic subplot. The love in Brother Bear is brotherly love, a nice change from the everyday plots of romance.The comedy comes from all of the characters, rather than a side-cast of characters inserted for the role so that the main cast can get out of having to be funny. Likewise for the drama-- everybody does something and nothing seems shoehorned or tacked-on. Overall an excellent story beautifully animated."
5,Love it!,"I love this movie so much! So many memories of watching it as a kid with my little sisters. Another one of those movies I could never find anywhere or if I did, it was way over priced. Found it on here and it shipped right away! Got it very quickly and it was in perfect condition, basically like buying it brand new from the store."
1,hm.,"Great Walt would rotate in his box, if he saw that movie.The music sounds exactly like >Tarzan< (same composer and song performer), the animation is'nt smooth or anything and the backgrounds are - except a few - just there for the reason. All characters look like a very poor and over-cleaned copy of >Lilo & Stitch<, which try to crawl through the boring >typical-Disney<-plot with all these jokes and dialogs seen so many times before.--> a hopeless try of Disney to get back to the roots but the mouse guys seem to have forgotten, what made Disney the most popular animation picture company in the world - the will to try out something new and special - to experiment with new types of art and plot (like >Les Triplettes de Belleville< for example) ..."
4,Solar power Casio,"I like this watch alot. Atomic, Solar, what do you need more than that. Casio quality. alarm could be little louder. I am very satisfied."
2,More Drills than 3-4-3,"Disappointed in the initial review and the video as it really is a CD of the players doing some drills, a couple of good ones, but that's not what I was looking for. I was hoping it was a more systematic review of the patterns of play and role responsibilites of the players in a 3-4-3. There was a very small segment on a single patter of play moving up the flank but other than that, nothing much. There was a discussion about its merits and also the 4-3-3 - which I coach now - but I wouldn't say I have any better understanding of implementing a 3-4-3 prior to before I watched it. Trying to implement the 3-4-3 was why I bought it so I would have to say it wasn't of great value to me other than the additonal drills."
4,Good batteries,"At 30 cents a piece (=60 cents a pair), these Memorex batteries are good alkaline batteries. However, don't expect to use them in digital cameras, as they won't last long. For digital cameras that take AA you should use NiMH rechargeable batteries. The Memorex is great for other electronics such as CD players, MP3 players, portable radios, etc."
2,RIO Not So XP Friendly,"The RIO One was a free bonus for purchasing Windows XP at Best Buy. Unfortunately, the drivers for the unit are not that XP friendly. The software included is an older version of real jukebox. It locks or hangs XP from time to time where the machine cannot be shut down, just shut off. If running XP do not buy this unit until fresh updated software is availble. The low rating is because of the lack of up to date software."
1,A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY!,"To make a long story short...it was purchased as a birthday gift. Worked for less than a month and completely died. Does nothing, nada, zip! No support - no replacement! Cheaply made piece of junk! PLEASE read all reviews on this product before purchasing it. Recommendation: Buy an MP3 player from another company!"
3,Understanding how we think we think,"Dr. Fine provides an excellent description of some of the ways our brain can trick us or create illusions for us. Those working human error issues should read this book. Although the content of the book is excellent, the writing style and format provides a challenge for readers when the readers attempt to extract the key lessons from the text. (I have encouraged Dr. Fine to consider a different format for her next book.) Therefore, prepare to work through this text as if you were taking calculus physics: the lessons will not come easy."
1,Absolutely terrible!,"If you're interested in this topic and want to read an entertaining yet expert presentation of it go directly to Thomas Kida's new book, ""Don't Believe Everything You Think"" instead. Or, even better, Thomas Gilovich's ""How What Know What Isn't So,"" or, for a more technical than popular account, Scott Plous' book on judgment and decision-making. Fine's book is too talky, filled to the brim with tedious anecdotes, and lacking any reference to the real research that has gone into the results that she superficially presents. Ironic that she glosses over evidence and proof that are necessary for clear and critical thinking while at the same time attempting to describe the phenomena that often cloud our thinking rationally! Maybe this would be appropriate for 10-12 year-olds but certainly is far below the level of adults who'd like some real information on the subject."
4,How we flatter ourselves!,"We humans are even more persuadable than we like to think. Cordielia Fine takes us on a breezy tour of some well-known psychological studies, and others that are less well known.We create flattering self-identities and then protect them in the face of evidence to the contrary. We are all delusional. We may like to think that we are logical actors, that we can be persuaded by reason, but when it comes to the test, (and there are many experimental tests) how we imagine ourselves to be, and how we act, are usually at odds.Ms. Fine shows how we are vain, emotional, immoral, deluded, pigheaded, secretive, weak-willed, and bigoted. Is this enough to get you to want to read it? These are the chapter titles. This is an intriguing look into how vulnerable we are to external stimulus and how our brains delude us.The only criticism I have, and it is a minor one, is that I would have preferred less about the author and her family."
1,is this what we want to teach our kids,I don't get the other reviews of this book. I find this book less about sharing and more of a commentary on american society of self absorption and taking things by force. this is not what I want to teach my son
3,"Large tent, great looks but not for cold weather","We bought this tent for a camping trip in October with our 16 month old son. Yeah, we should have thought that through a bit better but it was our only opportunity to go and we had camping fever. The tent was very roomy inside, lots of neat little pockets and vents. The biggest problem we had was the cold. Ok, in October the nights are chilly. But, had it not been for the entire back wall being mesh, we would have been a lot warmer. Even with an electric heater running all night, we were cold. On the second night we draped a tarp between the fly and the tent to cover the mesh window and keep the heat in. On a warm summer's night, take off the fly and sleep under the stars. Don't use this tent if the temps dropping below 15 over night."
3,Average Construction,"Don't assume that Columbia is the highest quality. While the tent is incredibly roomy, it's construction is average. I would compare this tent to a tent that one might purchase at a large chain department store.Pros: Inner height is about 6' which allows an average person to stand in the center. Lots of ventilation is a definite advantage in warm weather. Side pockets and gear loft allow for storage.Cons:The front lacks a vestibule which results in some potentially serious leakage around the door. Poorly sealed seams and stitching result in tears and leaks. The poles are made of cheap and easily frayed fiberglass. The rainfly does not extend to the ground, leaving the bottom quarter of the tent open to the elements. Cheap stakes do not work in sandy soil."
4,Good purchase,"I've used this tent twice for one night each time. It's pretty painless to set up, although having two people definitely helps. It's difficult to find the sleeve in the rainfly for the rainfly pole. Other than that, not too bad.The tent has held up well. It ventilates nicely and those doors on the side of the main door are great for the dog to go in and out. I love the fact that I can stand up in the middle of the tent. The storage bag that comes with this tent expands so you needn't roll the thing precisely to pack it up.On the down side, I found the rainfly difficult to line up over the tent so that it would be completely snug. Also, the stakes that come with the tent are a little flimsy. I bent the first stake that I tried to push into the ground (using my hand, not a hammer). Since then, the rest of the stakes have been OK.I bought the tent for $120 or $130 and I was very pleased with that price. it's a steal at $100."
4,Almost dry in a thunderstorm,"All in all this is a fabulous tent, as others have noted.We put this tent to the test on a hot August night that errupted in a major 1 hour thunderstorm with drenching rains for 2 hours. The tent stayed completely dry - except for the seam that had the ""In case of leaks..."" instruction label stitched into it! The seam holes around this label acted as a wick and sucked in a steady drip of rainwater in the center of the sleeping area. A dab of sealer should do the trick to make this tent 100% dry.Also, potential buyers should note that this tent does NOT have the The ""Clean Sweep zippered floor flap"" mentioned in the product description above. This was a major selling point for my husband, and a disappointment when no zipper was found.We've decided to keep the tent anyway, as the positives far outweigh these negatives."
2,Tentless,"My husband and I received the Bugaboo 2 days before our camping trip. We set it up at home to make sure everything was ok and we knew what we were doing. Everything seemed ok. Spacious tent, lots of extra neat gizmos. We got to the campsite and were inserting the rods through the proper sleeves when a cord on 1 of the poles snapped as if it had been worn through already!!!"
3,"Oldsters: ""It's alright""","Oh it's a kick. Nice variety, bright songs. As a untrustworthy thirty yr old (crappy at multi-tasking), must say I look forward to Tralala's future and, uh, evolving songwriting. I wanna see them get loose. Meaty. But don't get me wrong: all those voices make crazy pretty. Good for earnest harmony junkies.Strongest: ""No Pain"" and ""No/Yeah"""
5,bitchin',this is the most bitchin-est cd like i have ever heard of. these bastards can rap like no other!
4,The iron law of oligarchy,"Ironically, this book is known for producing one of the fundamental theories of political science, Michel's Iron Law of Oligarchy. But everybody seems to forget that the book itself focused more on Michel's to reconcile socialism with socialist parties. Michel uses his understanding of the self-interest of institutional leaders to express his skepticism that a democracy of the proletariat would ever arise. These parts of the book are interesting in that we get to see Michel engage in some soul-searching, but also probably involve more socialist ideology than modern readers would care for. However, for modern readers, the introduction by Lipset and Rokkan is probably all you need to understand the logic of the theory."
3,master wu's rating for-Kung Fu:Punch of Death,"This is a fairly good kung fu flick starring Meng Fei.It is about a young teenage boy named Fong Su Yee (Meng Fei) who beats a student from the local karate school. The two brothers who run the karate school, embarassed by their students defeat, decide to frame Fong Su Yee for a murder that they committed.They also kill someone close to Fong Su Yee in a fight. (i'm not going to say who they kill or it may ruin part of the story) Fong Su Yee would like nothing better than to take revenge, but as a fighter, he's just not ready yet.Every time he goes up against the brothers, he's beaten within an inch of his life! In order to win, he has to train hard. Luckily, he has the toughest trainer around...his mother!With her help,Fong Su Yee learns what it takes to be a real kung fu master.Now he has to Fight the two brothers plus their master can he win? Find out and buy the movie it's a great buy and it's dirt cheap."
4,A forgotten gem,"One of Clint Eastwood's biggest flops and least-known films, Honky Tonk Man is one of his best 'small' films, casting the star as a country and Western singer dying of consumption while on his way to grab a last chance of fame by cutting a record in Nashville with his estranged son (Kyle Eastwood) tagging along. A character-driven low-key road movie with a well-realised Depression era setting, it veers from the redneck comedy of his orangutan outings to the darker undercurrents of Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, with the characters gradually working their way into your affections to make the underplayed ending genuinely touching.The ony extra on the DVD is the theatrical trailer."
5,"Most Country Music ""Stars"" Can't Sing Either!!!","This is yet another wonderful offerring by Clint Eastwood. In this movie Clint plays Red, an aspiring guitarist and singer who dreams of performing in Memphis. We see Red's deterioration through Tuberculosis as the movie progresses. His final cry to a lost love is more believable than anything I have seen or read by that so called ""Master Of Vulnerable Sentimental Nostalgia"" Tennessee Williams.I give this movie 5 stars because Mr. Eastwood can't sing which means he has something in common with most Country Music Stars today."
1,Horrid- all white margin space,"The cut size of this print is impressive.However, more than half of it is blank white margin."
1,Size does matter!,What the heck! I thought I was getting a stylus that would fit in my Palm. This is a full size pen and doesn't do me any good for travel. It defeats the whole purpose of just carrying a Palm - now I have to carry my Palm and a pen...? I don't think so. Where is that return label...
2,Yoga Meditation,"I purchased this product looking for a cd to meditate with, to relax and help with my migraines. The music changes on the cd, and I did not find it particularly conducive ot a meditation lasting 30-45 minutes. Too much variation led to me changing gears in the middle of the meditation."
5,The courage ot change,"The transformation of the former Cat Stevens in Yusuf Islam is a musical and visual feast.The courage of this man to go where is head and heart lead him is inspiring.That he has adopted a religion that is so misunderstood and has done so much to show that one view of any religion is wrong, there are many views.Well worth the money and the time to view the concert and the story."
5,letting his light shine again,"it took me awhile to accept his transformation to Yusuf Islam but once i did, i was rewarded. the talent & voice of Cat Stevens is intact. this show was beautifully set & recorded. i like it even better than Majikat and as much as his old KCET concert.his updates of his classics still retain their original spirit & the new songs stand well next to the classics, not like other classic rockers' new songs which audiences politely bear through in order to hear the hits.i hope he performs more & i'm glad he has given life back to his music. like it saids in the bible, he has a special light too precious to keep locked away."
2,Would be better with pictures,"Many people may know the name of the products in the book, but many may not. Therefore, pictures to help identify them would have been great help."
3,Suprisingly Entertaining!!!,"Greetings,I simply wanted to come to the website to congratulate the group. I stumbled on their cd yesterday, and I bought it used on a whim. My initial perception of 3rd Storee was, Oh God----another B2k group and I will simply gag! However, they actually surprised me with their extraordinary vocal ability. Their first single, Get with Me, did not give their vocal skills justice, however it was a moderately catchy and appealing single. Although I feel some of the production was shallow, their vocals made up for that. I was thinking, if we get these guys with the right producers, they can blow us away. They have raw talent, undeniable. Because of some of the redundant outdated beats, I only liked 4-5 of the songs---which is a moderate buy. We should give these guys a chance because they are BLOWING on this album."
5,Get With 3rd Storee's Get Wtih Me!,"I've got to say that I didn't think these five young brothers had it in them, but their vocal skills are up to par. The first single off their album 'Get With Me' is my jam, and the second single 'I'm Sorry' is one of the most beautiful love ballads that I've ever heard. I recommend that everyone make this album a stocking stuffer because it would be a great gift for the holiday season."
5,3rd storee is back and slammin,"3rd Storee new cd is excellent their voices are amazing you can tell that they were ready I actually got a chance to hear them live at the bow wow concert a few months back and was very eager to purchase their cd I listen to it everyday, every song has a message to it especially the slow cuts like I'm Sorry that is my favorite and I just read that that will be their new single coming out which is just great you can really hear them sing indiviually they all have beautiful voices hope they stay around for along time."
4,Warm and beautiful music,"This is the perfect CD to turn down the lights, light up a candle or two, and just chill out! It has a wonderful mix of warm earthy vocals (Norah Jones's two tracks here are especially stand out, as well as excellent work by the resident vocalist, Maria Turner) with live jazz instruments and chilled laid back beats. The music envelopes you in a warm wash of sound and doesn't let go until the last track."
4,Good Stuff,"I love my new Zen MicroPhoto...everything is good about it except the fact that I can't listen to music while looking at my pictures at the same time, and that it says that it has 8 gigs of memory but really when you look at the information screen on the player it says that the total memory is only about 7600 MB of memory...other than that a great product...highly recommended :-)"
3,get the original Zen Micro,"I purchased the Zen Microphoto when my original (black and white screen) zen micro was dropped several times, and then i broke it.to be honest the zen microphoto isnt any better thatn the original zen micro besides the fact that it can contain photos and the viewing screen is in color.the fact that the screen is in color and it takes alot of energy to light up the entire screen, it seems that the functioning process to actually use the product takes a really long time-much longer than the original zen micro. the zen micro was easier to turn on and off and shift from menu to menu, whereas the zen mircophoto goes through some glitches here adn there and the screen freezes whereas the zen mirco doesnt.basically, go buy the zen micro its better than the microphoto and kind of looks better too ( i think th sparkly metallic thing going on with the microphoto is crazy)"
4,Get Creative,"I never had to use customer support, that's why it gets four stars.Wow I have owned this wonderful toy for a year Never had a problem with.I have dropped it! It rebooted and rebuilt the library. It does so much. records, records your favorite radio programs too. (Think Felix Hernandez)Keeps data and photos (no Video) Create play lists whatever suits your mood. It's like walking around with your own theme music. An equalizer, choose your list random or planned. Play all or play some. Adjust the volume. Oh and another thing get your own headphones. Creative gives you an excellent product then gives you really cheap ear phones. But if your thinking of buying this at 8GB think twice and get more than 3 times as much space for the same price.Creative Zen Sleek Photo 20 GB Multimedia Player (Aluminum/White)Same price but get more, more more! A little larger, same functions but at 20GB you'll lose your mind and make extensive use of Amazon's very varied music library."
2,"Good features, poor quality and horrible customer support.","Functionally (when it works) this is a great product with just the right feature set. Unfortunately, it is made by a company with horrible policies and service. My first player had a screen defect. I returned it the first day. Then the second one stopped working only 80 days from purchase. I called and described the issue (10 minute boot time, no longer recognized by PC), and they said I can pay for support. 80 days out and I pay for support? Buy an iPod."
2,Great looking MP3 BUT,The Creative Zen Micro Photo 8GB Mp3 player is a beauty. I have to say though that after owning for less than 10 days the player just froze the the Creative Zen Micro screen. I tried taking out the battery and putting it back in but it still froze at exactly the same place. I just decided to return it rather than replace it.
2,bad experiance,I got this product as a gift which worked great for about a month and then the drive crashed.Went to walmart and exchanged for a new one only to have the same thing happen within a day.My husband has the blue zen which seems to work fine so my advice is dont buy the grey.
3,Could have been great....,"Nice screen, standard mini USB cable, nice sound, good battery life, replaceable battery.Could be great but for a number of annoying failures:- Can't view photos and listen to music- Does not show up as a drive on windows (must allocate space to be a drive)- Can't play tracks on device on your computer, must copy track to computer drive.- No star ratings for songs- No way to flag a now playing song as ""good""- Can't charge on computer and play music at the same time."
2,So-so,"Most of the time I'm pretty happy with this player, but it freezes pretty frequently, requiring me to remove and replace the battery -- a major annoyance. I bought it to listen to in my car, and the controls are not the easiest to use while driving. While I'm not completely dissatisfied, I wouldn't purchase it again."
2,Awesome when it worked,"I really enjoyed my Zen, when it worked. The first one I ordered I had to return becuase it would only play every other song, and after it started acting up all the lights would start blinking and I would have to take out the battery to make it stop. So, I exchanged it for a new one, and just like the other after only one week the lights started going crazy again, it would freeze up, and would only play 5 seconds of every song. What I liked about it, for the small amount of time I had it was the sound quality, the choice in colors, and the fact that it was so much cheaper than other models with the same amount of storage space. I'm not sure I would recommend it becuase of the fact that they both only worked for a few days. Now I have an Iriver Clix and have had no problems. It has less storage but I don't care, it is easier to control and I haven't had problems with it."
1,Customer Service Not Helpful,"Purchased this Zen Microphoto 8GB over a year ago. Was able to load the first batch of songs and everything went ok. The second time I went to load songs the player was not recognized by the computer. Since then other than to play the original set of loaded songs this player has been worthless. I sent an email (twice) to Creative and both times rcvd the same reply, which was to check their Knowledge Base to search for an answer to the problem (and there were many re this problem). I had been trying all of these (and checking their forum for ideas) for 1 year and still nothing worked. I have put countless hours into this Zen and it still will not work correctly!! My advice to anyone interested in the Zen Microphoto is to check their forum under the search ""player not connected"" or ""player not recognized"". You will be flooded with questions from hundreds of customers with the same problem. Let this convince you to stay clear of this MP3 player."
3,"If you use iTunes, get an iPod","Overall, the Zen is okay. I could not transfer my songs from iTunes directly onto it. I didn't like the headphones. When the screen is illuminated, a screeching noise is sent through the headphones. I also hate the software. It has virtually no good options. It's a sturdy mp3 player, but has its flaws. I don't really have anything else to compare it to."
2,Great product - if it worked,This would be a great MP3 player if it worked.I chose it so I could download subscription music.The first problem was that the LCD display nevercame on most of the time until I reset the playerseveral times in a row. Resetting the player meansremoving the battery. I decided I could live withthat until the thing stopped working altogether.Now its just a dead MP3 player. I just hope thatI can get in touch with Creative Tech Support intime to get a replacement before the warranty runsout. No luck so far.
1,Garbage,"Horrible battery life, breaks on me once every few months. Really nothing special about the extra features. You can upload pictures on it to view them on the 1.5"" screen. Whoop-dee-doo.Do yourself a favor and pass on this one..."
2,Great while it worked,"I had one for almost 5 months, when it was a great player, primarily for audiobooks. Then it stopped working. After 3-4 hours trying to get fixes from the Creative web-site, I am looking for a new player. I hope one that is a bit more reliable than this one."
2,Monotonic,"Story is about a 9 year old child who is lost in a forest. The story is very monotonic and did not excited me. I only liked the last chapter and after reading that one i got near to cry. All the story passes in a forest and contains some references to her past experiences. She is a little shysophrenic becouse most of the time she ""saws"" Tom Gordon (also she know he is not there :)).Book may be can be used for a reference book: ""How to survive in a forest"" bot not for getting excited.Kings little ""excited"" tellings did not made me feel so. It may be a great book but did not gave me what i had waited for. May be was not my style."
1,Can't believe he wrote it!,"Wow, not at all the usual King. Just scary enough to keep the kids from wandering off the trail. I forgive you Stephen, your're entitled to one loser now and then."
2,Quite Possibly his worst book ever,"I don't know what he was thinking when he wrote this. Not scary, not frightening, and not even any good. There isn't a hint of suspense in this book. The whole book is just disappointing. It's about a girl that gets lost in the world and lives off of berries. She's scared the whole time and if she had just stayed on the trail, I wouldn't have had to read this garbage for two hours. Leave this be."
3,Very Impressing,"4 WORDS FOR YOU: A VERY GOOD BOOK. It is a good book. STRONGLY recommended for those Teenagers who love thrilling, suspencful-adventure book! It's was great!"
3,little smokey,This book was in great condition but the smell of smoke was so strong when I opended it that I had to let it air out for awhile before I could stand to read it.
1,This was one bad book!,I can't believe Stephen King wrote this book. There wasn't one bit of horror in it. I kept reading hoping that it would get better by the end but it didn't. What a waste of time!
3,"well, its ok but not for stephen","I have read most of stephen kings works and he is by far my favorite author, but this was a very bizzare book for him. don't get me wrong, it was interesting to read and it did keep me interesting but it seemed more like his first book than his 30 -ish. If it were someone else who wrote it i would give it four stars, but i have come to expect more out of stephen king."
5,Good read,As always Stephen king writes marvelous books. Well written.Good book of you are a baseball fan. Definitely recommend. Confusing at some points.
2,????,"What happened to Stephen King and his writing style? After BAG OF BONES, I started to read this one. Very dissapointing indeed."
4,The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon,"To be 100% honest, Stephen King isn't really my kind of writer. However, I needed to pick a book to read for school, and I was trying to reach out of my comfort zone. And there was a Stephen King book, and it was fairly short and most likely easier to understand than any other King book, so I decided to read it.If I were to rate this book on how much I liked it, I would have given it three stars. However, as it is... it wasn't a bad book. It's just, like I said, not my thing. It was good and interesting, but at parts it seemed slightly repetitive. I also didn't like the way the whole book (plus or minus a few small parts) was written all about Trisha in the woods. It would have been interesting to have an outsider's perspective, either at the beginning or the end, at least. But still, it was pretty well written. I liked it."
3,OK,"I've just recently finished reading this book and in my opinion it is just a simple ride of a book, with many emotional ups and downs. The plot is fine, the story is well written , judging that it is from the point of view of a nine year old. It is what I would call a mediocre piece of work. It is, in a sense, sort of long and tiring, leaving the readers feeling sorry for the main character as she experiences an endless array of survival problems. It is not boring , just wearisome. I thought that the conflict was resolved rather too quickly in that on meeting the Wasp God, a terror that unfailingly evoked feelings of fear, he was quite easily defeated. It is not detestable, it is ok, and in fact, the storyline is quite enthralling, a little girl fantasising about her favourite baseball hero so as to ward off all fears. Not an edge-of-the-seater but simple and nice."
2,"Average story, average value","Stephen King's attempt at blending sports with ""horror"" is a failed one. This book is all just suggestion. It is just a big obsessive thought of this lost little girl who is only having an argument with her id (Fruedian Psychology). The god of death, who is supposedly a huge monster, without giving the ending away, is not that much of a monster after all. He is not even that strong. King also tries to include some theme in his novel. He tries to say that God does not help anybody, and is to busy to answer her prayers. I think Stephen King is running out of ideas. This book was probably more for teenagers than for adults. My advise, don't buy this book. The movie will be better, if they are actually going to make one."
3,Not my favorite King,"While hiking the Appalachian Trail with her mother and brother, nine year old Trisha McFarland leaves the path to use the bathroom in the woods. No one saw her leave the path and she ventures so far into the woods that she is unable to find her way back. So begins The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon.I'm a huge Stephen King fan. That being said, I was a little disappointed in this book. His stories usually grab me right away and don't let go until the very end. This one didn't do that. It wasn't a bad book at all. It just didn't grab me. As a matter of fact, this is about the fourth time I've tried to read this book and the first time I ever got past chapter two. Once I did get past chapter two, I was more interested in the story and was able to finish. I'm not a baseball fan either, so that probably added to my disinterest. Funny thing is, this book will probably appeal to people that are not fans of Stephen King's typical fare."
1,If not for the author - this book wouldn't have been noticed,The author has a big name and I love his books. Before I would purchase anything with the name Stephen King on it. But from now I will think twice. This book about a lost girl and it is an average fiction which wouldn't make any bestseller list if the author would be less known to general audience. Total waste of time and money.
2,unusual king...,"As masterful ""bag of bones"" was, the girl who loved tom gordon falls very much flat. As much as I hate to give bad reviews it seems to me, as this book has been hanging around in sk's drawer and met a tight deadline...as a non baseball fan I did not particular understand the ""baseball talk"" or was very interested in it. The bad entity in the forests was immediately identified as a bear. What a surprise! The whole story starts promising with family twists and so one and then suddenly we find ourselves in an enviroment which is not so scary.. As a big SK fan I was not very disappointed rather than surprised. So Fans go for it, read it in an hour and put it in your collection. Lets wait for another one...bt"
2,How can a Stephen King book be this BORING?,My least favorite Stephen King Novel. I kept waiting for something to happen. Anything!
5,"One of King's best -- about human, not supernatural, events.","I have been a Stephen King fan for many years and read everything he wrote until ""Pet Semetary"" -- which was the launching pad for a long string of supernatural horror books. In ""The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon,"" King proves his talent is at its best when he writes about human, rather than supernatural, events. This novel is very believable; it never strays from the realm of reality. Once again, we see that King can write a female viewpoint as convincingly as a male. I sincerely hope he plans more like this."
1,What happened to the old Stephen King!!!,"Never having been a fan of mass popular fiction, I restricted myself to reading Stephen King. The old Stephen King who produced masterpieces such as IT, Misery and Bag of Bones. Wading through The girl who Loved Tom Gordon was just that; a struggle to finish it. The novel read like something cooked over the weekend to meet a publisher's deadline. It was offensive to my intellect as a reader both in its naive portrayal of the issue of religion and also the crass treatment of a teenager's nine days in the wilderness. The novel is suitable for teenagers, not adults fooled enough by the other works of King to buy this particular book. I hope that Mr. King will seriously ponder his latest novel and attempt not to fall into the trap of commerical productions whereby you had to produce anything once a year irrespective of the quality."
2,BORING,"I was pretty dissapointed with this book. I was expecting much more, but I did come to love the poor lost girl. It was, however, a very drawn out story--- it's only 200+ pages. I was expecting better."
3,A book for younger readers.,Although I thoroughly enjoyed Stephen Kings new book. It was lacking the macabre & gore that one expects from a typical with a King novel. This novel is for younger readers more than adults.
4,Pretty good,"I have been reading Stephen King for 20 years, and I am only 32. This book is an easy, quick read and worth the effort. It is a different direction than most of his works but it fails to completely engross the reader. Plus, it badly needs some editing. Joe Castiglione is the Red Sox' play-by-play man, Jerry Trupiano is the color man, sometimes these two are reversed. Also, please it is Jason VAritek, not VEritek! Overall, it seems like Mr. King tossed this one off in a few hours. He's talented."
2,Dissapointed,"I have been a faithful Stephen King fan for as long as I can recall. This book was sadly a dissapointment to me. The writing was terrific of course, but the story didn't seem to have enough substance."
3,An absorbing story,In the past week I have read The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon and Hearts in Atlantis. They are very different. Both are very worthwhile. This book sucks you in and won't let you go. The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon is very fast paced and I love the message. The last few paragraphs are outstanding. A recommendable book-even if you aren't a Sox fan.
2,Big dissappointment,"Compared to Bag of Bones and other Stephen King greats, this book let me down. The writting was good but the story did not seem to go anywhere. When I finished the book, I didn't feel that much happened since the second chapter. I love Mr. King's books and will continue to read them. However, I do not recommend that this be one of his books that you buy."
2,ZZZZzzzzzzzzz,"I have heard from many people that The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon was one of Stephen King's best books. I strongly disagree. Like most King books, TGWLTG had a promising start, but it just dragged on and on and on. The villain in this story did not even affect me in the slightest. The reason I am giving it 2 stars instead of 1 is because I truly cared for Trish McFarland. This 9 year-old girl had a lot of spunk, I give her that. But in the end I was thoroughly disappointed."
4,It's tough to be a kid,"Just remember your childhood. Remember all of the things you had to struggle with just to make it from day to day. Remember your fear, so strong you could taste it. Now take those experiences and turn them into a parable. King has described all the things we face as kids in a lyrical story. Tom Gordon is the refuge we all sought when we were picked on at school, called on to read outloud, face our parents discord amd possible divorce. The courage and determination she shows in the face of such odds is the stuff we dreamed we could have done as kids."
3,Only for those who dont need blood and horror!,"I started to reading this book awhile after christmas. It was not that kind of book you cant put down, but it wasnt that kind of book you just read halt trouh. Its about this girl who get lost in the forrests of Maine. A book about how to be young and lonely and how to be afraid. All the book throuh I waited for this thrilling moment that Stephen King usualy has in his book, but it never came. The book is not the best hes ever written, but its worth a shot if you are a fan who dont need all the blood and horror. Harts in Atlantis is alot better!"
4,An unheralded gem,"A pleasant surprise from Stephen King.For years, I had not worried about this being the only Stephen King book that I hadn't read. Many people said that it really wasn't a great book and several said that they had started it but never finished it.Frankly, I don't know what the problem was. The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon is a gripping story about a little girl who is lost in the woods. It narrates the trials and tribulations of her journey and struggle to survive on her own in a seemingly unending wilderness. During this we are shown the incredible strength of her character even as she falls deeper and deeper into madness. Along her journey, she encounters many pitfalls and dangers along with a brush with the malevolent supernatural.This is a very entertaining story and I thoroughly enjoyed it."
5,I think I love Tom Gordon,"I was done reading this book just as soon as I opened the cover. My friend recommened that I read the book because it was a ""quick read,"" but I didn't think it would go quite as quickly as it did. Stephen King really knows how to hold a reader's attention. The suspense was non-stop up until the end. I found myself worrying about the well being of this nine-year-old girl while I was suppose to be learning other topics at school. I've never been much of a fan of literature, but this book just might have turned me into a Stephen King fan. The usage of sports as a reason to stay alive was very refreshing. It made me realize that there's more to life than just money and careers; there's also entertainment. Life's simple pleasures can actually keep somebody alive. I loved the book and I recommend that everyone should read it."
2,Not the Steven King I remembered as a kid,"Don't get me wrong- this story was well written, but it lacked the punch that other Steven King books delivered for me when I last read some of them years ago (e.g., The Stand, Pet Cemetery, It). King is gifted at describing horror in the commonplace (think Cujo or Christine), but even he couldn't wring macabre out of a simple case of a girl lost in the woods. The story was convincing in that I believed it accurately depicted what a 9 year old would do if lost in the woods, but I just didn't care that much. Also, the creature stalking the girl is a let down and kind of seems tossed in as an afterthought. The girl was perishing all right on her own without the intervention of evil incarnate shaped like a badly drawn bear."
1,A big bore - never finished,"Lost me after the first 25 pages. Skimmed about 20 pages more, then gave it back to the library. No dialogue, just thoughts going through a little girls head while she get lost in the woods. Big disappointment..."
2,"Not great, no where nearly as good as classic King","I have read almost everything Stephen King ever wrote and loved it up. This time however, I was quite disappointed. The book is (YAWN) really very slow and the plot is too simple. It would have been a better 50-70 page short story - maybe that's what it was originally and it was just stretched out to be a (very short) novel.For example, my wife asked me what the book was about and I was able to explain the plot, characters and climax to her in about 2 minutes flat. Not what I expect from Stephen King.In short, not worth the money."
5,TGWLTG,"For those of you who have read Lost on a Mountain in Maine you'll find this novel equally as satisfying. Trish, 9-years-old-going-on-10-and-big-for-her-age, steps off the trail to pee and decides to take a short-cut back to her mother and brother. Of course she gets lost and, of course, something is tracking her. Something not so nice. This is Stephen King, right? The class read the Bottom of the 9th & Save Situation twice before we finished it. They loved it."
4,"GOOD BOOK, BUT NOT ENOUGH OF THE ""MASTER OF HORROR"" KING!!","This book was not what I expected. It wasn't as scary as all the other King books!!! It started out very slow for the first 60 pages or so, then picked up to a semi-suspense for the remainder of the book. I'm not saying that this book is boring, or not good, but that it is just different. If you want to read a King book or any book that has a little suspense and it's intense moments, but is mostly drama, this is the book for you!!! If your looking for that kind of book I promise you will love this book!!!"
2,Manager should've yanked King from this game,"Thin plotting makes THE GIRL WHO LOVED TOM GORDON minimalist Stephen King, reasonably decent entertainment for a night but without the kind of imagination this writer normally displays. Coming off the far superior BAG OF BONES, it is a very slight effort indeed and, as it is actually only novella-length, it might have been wiser to save this story for the King anthology coming out later this year. The five-star raves for this rather ordinary book are typical of undiscriminating King readers; to suggest this book is as good as THE STAND or THE DARK TOWER series or even MISERY is simply ludicrous."
2,Representative of Recent King Dropoff,"I used to be a HUGE King fan. However, his recent stuff simply pales in comparison to his earlier works, and this book is a prime example. Little girl lost is NOT what King does best, and using that as his premise doomed the book from the beginning. King is at his best when he does sprawling semi-supernatural, semi-horror thrillers like IT and the Stand(two of the best horror works ever written). He is not at his best with short puff pieces. Just like Tommie himself is breaking down as a reliever, Steve is, unfortunately, breaking down as an author."
3,GOOD AFTERNOON READ,"After reading this, I felt that Mr. King woke up, ate breakfast, went to his computer and finished the novel before Tabitha called him for supper. Not great, but not bad -- if you're frightened of the woods, this makes a decent companion piece to ""PET SEMATARY."" If you've ever been lost in the woods, it just might horrify you. Don't expect much and you might like it. A big plus is that it isn't too long, like many of Mr. King's past indulgences. Might be his shortest novel since ""CARRIE."" It's just right."
2,Boring Boring Boring,"I bought this book in an airport, depending on Stephen King to get me through a multi-hour plane ride. Imagine my disappointment. Trekking around the woods with a young girl being chased by a not-particularly scary monster. She keeps falling down, running the wrong way, etc. The allusions to the family's experience while she's missing were the strongest parts of this novel, but they are momentary. If you're a diehard Stephen King fan, get the book for your collection, then go back and read The Shining, Salem's Lot, or one of the other classics."
3,Disappointing,"This book was definitely a slow mover and not what is a normal Stephen King novel. Though, I have to admit, I had to finish the book because I needed to know if and how the little girl gets out of the woods."
3,a little bit of a letdown,"I found this book a letdown, probably because I read The Green Mile right before this. I was expecting more. King describes the forest in a way that you can envision yourself out there with Trisha. The parts of her listening to her walkman to hear Tom Gordon were interesting. Mr. King does his job though, as I found myself feeling worried and sorry for her all along. I did like the ending."
2,BORING,"I was quite disappointed with this one. I usually love Stephen King, but I have to admit this was slow going. A girl is lost in the woods......with a lame ending. If you're looking to be scared about being in the woods....rent ""The Blair Witch Project"" and watch it by yourself at night. I'm just glad I borrowed this book and didn't purchase it. Stephen King has MUCH better books. Maybe next time.........."
1,Stephen King Flopped with this book.,"I am an avid reader of any Stephen Kings books and expected much more from him then this book offered. It was very slow and had a very boring, repetative plot. The book is based on a little girl who gets lost and does the same thing day in and day out, over and over again. If you would like a excellent adventure..check out some of Bently Little's books."
4,I Just Couldn't Put It Down!,"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon is the first Stephen King book I have ever read, and I must say that it motivates me to read more works by him. I could not put down this book. I read it for a book report, but realized that I also enjoyed reading it. I enjoyed the spiritual themes, which from what I hear, is unusual for King. Tom Gordon represents Trisha's guardian angel, her only hope for ""saving"" herself. Whenever he saves a game for the Red SOx, he points to the sky to say thank you to God again reflecting the spiritual theme. Even if you have never read a Stephen King novel, I highly suggest you start with this one. It's not really that scary, but it offers enough horror and suspense to keep you interested."
1,It is just a book about a little girl lost.,"I am an avid fan of Mr.King's but this was not one of his better books. It was just a book about a little girl lost in the woods. Come on Stephen, you can do much better."
1,jazzer,"This was one on the least interesting books I've read. Didn't anyone else notice how absurd the so called ""monster"" bear was? The kinds of bears that live in New Hampshire don't kill deer and spread thier entrails all over and would never track and attack a human. It would have been more interesting if he had used a ""real"" monster instead."
4,Short but Fulfilling,"King writing short stories, of which I consider this to be, taking into account the majority of his novels, generally does a superb job with them - and this is no exception.He still has the evocative descriptions that populate all of his novels, but in Tom Gordon he has kept the story to basically one level, with none of the intertwining tales he generally includes in his longer books. There's no outright ""boogeyman"" in this story, it's left up to the reader to decide if there's really something out there, or if its the state of the girl's mind, and she's imagining it all after being in the woods alone for so long.An enjoyable read, easy to get through in an afternoon sitting, and without any of my usual reactions to his books, ie. have I REALLY locked all the doors? and what's that noise I'm hearing?"
5,One of his best,I just finished reading this book and I think it was one of his best. Not his best but one of his best. The Editorial Reviews says everything. You can just see this poor child lost in the woods and feel her pain and her fear. I was glad it was only 219 pages because I couldn't wait to find out what happered to her. I am not interested in baseball or know anything about it but I was glad that child had someone to keep her from going totally nuts. I raved about this book to other readers and talked them into reading it. Thank you Stephen for writing a book I could sit down and read in a couple of day.
4,Still another side of Stephen King.,"Read this in two sittings. A well written suspenseful journey into the mind of a young girl lost and alone. The more vivid your imagination-the more you'll like this book. As is so typical with Stephen King, everyone ""sees"" a different monster or horror. This is fast paced enough to keep you on the edge. A good read!"
4,SK - A 200 page hardcover?????,"As a die hard fan of Stephen King, I spent my Saturday afternoon curled up on my sofa reading and expecting to be looking over my shoulder for a week due to whatever creepy crawly SK cooked up this time. The book didn't pull up the basement files of my imagination like his books normally do. Trish is a great character, but the baseball references just didn't do it for me. Personally, I am still patiently waiting for the next in the Gunslinger series. I can't get enough of that story (even with the strange Wizard of Oz references). If SK reads these reviews - I hope he is only taking a break from the next book in that series. Also - I missed the little note from him at the beginning of the book letting us know what he is working on and what dark places he has been to lately."
2,"not this time, king","I didn't really like this book. King uses his same old mastery of mental pictures to make the book vivid... but in my opinion, it really wasn't a very good story to begin with."
3,Go Red Sox!,"Nine year old Trisha McFarland, wearing her favorite blue Red Sox batting practice shirt and Red Sox cap, began her six mile hike in the woods with her mother and brother Pete. Her troubled brother and recently divorced mother were constantly bickering. This hike of the Applachian Trail could not for one moment extinguish or interrupt their steady flow of quarreling. To evade this annoying and endless confrontation, Trisha drops back and wanders off. She decides to go forward instead of backtracking to the path and unknowingly strays further and further into the wilderness. Trisha listens to her Walkman for comfort and hears the Boston Red Sox game being broadcast and anxiously awaits the performance of her hero, number 36, relief pitcher, Tom Gordon. Trisha truly amazed me with every turn of the page, displaying courage, faith and a will to survive. Stephen King transports the reader to a new plateau of emotions in this novel. Did I mention that I was also a Red Sox fan?"
4,Alot of fun,"This game was one of the easiest I have ever owned, but it was still one of the most fun games I have ever played. The controls were a no-brainer to figure out and it was just about impossible to screw this game up. It doesn't allow you to go anywhere or do anything that isn't required to finish the game. If you are looking for strategy, this game isn't for you. if you have seen the movie and you love Batman, then you will love it."
3,"Uneven album hits highs, lows.","At its best, this album is one of the most moving musical experiences you're likely to have. I've never bought an album based on one track before, but when I heard ""Fallen Star"" on the radio, I rushed out to get it. In fact, several tracks on the album approach an almost ethereal level. On the other hand, the album is far too short (44 min.), and some of Michael Brook's techno-noodlings detract from the goings-on. Plus, he seems to actually give Gasparyan's duduk short shrift. I wanted more Gasparyan, less Brook! However, all things considered, how many albums have tracks that you can literally listen to over and over again and still be moved?"
5,Worth the Purchase,"I had long wanted to see ""Winchester 73"" for quite a while, due to the storyline and Jimmy Stewart headlining. I rarely buy a DVD before viewing it first, and when I do decide to purchase , it usually requires even more debate. I took a chance and bought it because I love westerns and I love Jimmy. Not only was I satisfied with the main plot, which was only a back-drop for the film's multiple sub-plots, but every scene was interesting which is difficult to pull off in any film. The movie was well paced and had good action sequences. I won't delve into any one scene because I don't want to give anything away, but I will say this: check out a young Rock Hudson in a small but memorable role as a...well you'll just have to see it for yourself. The best extra in this item is easy: the commentary by the one an only MR. STEWART. This DVD was well worth the purchase."
2,"Great Western, Incredibly Poor DVD Transfer","It's a real shame how badly this film was transferred to DVD. Much of the DVD is fine; some sections of it look better than I've ever seen in any other format, displaying the excellence of the black-and-white photography. But other sections are grainy and marred by distracting visual noise, and that isn't the worst of it: In several places during the film, the DVD ""jumps"" from one scene to another because obviously the source material was so poor! It's like watching a worn-out, popping film in a run-down theater! This is something I can't ever recall on a DVD transfer of a film as exciting and important as ""Winchester '73.""The interview with Jimmy Stewart as he watches the film with the interviewer is interesting, but the ""Winchester"" DVD overall ranks as a *MAJOR* disappointment."
4,Winchester 73,Being able to find a unique gift like the movie Winchester 73 is very important to me. I happen to give my brother a birthday gift every year that has his birthday+1 in it. I have been doing this for many years. Hence when I searched the number 73 (as he really only is 72) I was delighted to come up with Winchester 73 because not only did it provide the unique gift but he is also a western movie buff. The gift was perfect
5,who says a funk band can't play...,"Omaha in the 60's and 70's had pockets of musical TRUTH, and Lester Abrahms and his group L.A. Carnival were...the BOMB. The Showpushers, The Highlighters, Man-vs-Man, Dr. Scholl's and His Funky Footpad Band, are just a few groups that were tighter than a rat's...well, you get the picture...the Beck Brothers, Ron E. and Don E. and their sib's Keith and Carol Rogers, their mom Jeanne Rogers, Richard Chapman, Luigi Waites, and the Great Preston Love...shoot, I could go on and on. All I can say is, 'you had to be there', but since you can't...Get This!!ps. Regarding Tower of Power...listen to Squib Cakes and Oakland Stroke on Back to Oakland...real funky,"
1,Disapointed,"Extremely disapointed. I just bought it and brought it with me as my only camera on my honeymoon and was unable to take any pictures with it. Dispite following all the cautions stated on the camera regarding the seal, during my first role of film while snorkeling the camera died. It appears to be extremely sensitive to water. I would not reommend this to anyone who would like to use it in the water, which is the main reason I picked this one."
2,Indoor quality - Bad,"I have been using this camera for quite some time now and I'm very disappointed. Night and indoor pictures I have taken are terrible. I have the camera setup correctly, but the pictures are either really fuzzy or dark."
3,Solid album,"Subramaniam is a very talented man and it shows in this album. However, at times the music delves into new-age schmaltzy sound. I would suggest buying his Global Fusion album, which is truly great and generally positively reviewed, before listening to this one."
2,Was a favorite,"I have taken this magazine for over 30 years and was a great fan of it but it has changed over the last few years and has more advertisements than articles and recipes. I have finally decided it was not worth renewing. If you want a good magazine try ""Fine Cooking"" or ""Italia Cooking"" you will really get your money's worth and some wonderful recipes."
2,It Used to Be Better,"I am a long-term (soon not-to-be) subscriber. 10 years ago, you would get this magazine and end up keeping the whole issue because there were so many good recipes. Not any more! Since William Gaines passed away and Barbara Fairchild took over, it's become a love letter to yuppies who frequent gourmet markets. Like the Aug. issue: under Every Night Cooking they suggest Portuguese Clams with Linguica and Tomatoes. Not at my house! And the people they profile are not down-to-earth every day people, but wealthy yuppies at their summer home in the Hamptons trooping to the beach with their Sancerre and couscous. Give me a break! Even the Thanksgiving issue isn't a keeper anymore. I'll thumb through my 1995 back issues and dream of a simpler time."
5,Great cooking magazine.,Nice Editor-In-Chief. Nice pictures of the food. Recipes are laid out nicely.
4,mmmm good,"Just got my first issue and loved all the pictures of the food. Now i havetwo small kids and most likely wouldn't cook most of the food in the issue, but it doesn't mean i can't drool over it all. Overall a great magazine if you LOVE to see great food and read a few articles."
4,Impressive!!!,"Got my 1st issue and I'm already impressed! I don't think this mag will ever disappoint me (hope so!)... Love, love, love it!!!"
3,Okay...,"The magazine is okay, but impractical for me. A lot of the recipes are expensive to make or take up a lot of time. I received this magazine for a year and never once made a recipe in it because of the expense, mainly. Most of the recipes do sound good but this magazine is just not made for a person without a lot of time or money."
3,"Inconsistant recipe quality, nice photos","I've been a subscriber to Bon Appetit for several years now, and while I like the magazine I have found the quality of the recipes lack consistency. Some are good. Some quite poor. I'm always a little hesitant to rely on a recipe from this magazine for a dinner unless I've tested it first and seen that it worked well for me. Bon Appetit recipes can be quite complicated and its a disappointment to spend so much time cooking a meal and have it turn out bland.Overall, while I will continue to subscribe to Bon Appetit, I suggest using caution on relying on their recipes too much. Also, I feel the adverts, interviews, and other ""Filler"" material is beginning to lean a bit towards the elitist side of the cooking market and is becoming less accessible to the average non-pro cook."
5,One of best cooking magazines!,"To whomever is interested in cooking and wanting to learn more about it, this magazine is for you. It is packed with info varying from restaurants across the US to recipes sent in by readers. It also has recipes by chefs such as Bobby Flay and others. It gives a lot of ideas and it is not pretentious like others."
1,Don't but these battery,They are no good if they work at all it's only for a hour or two! These battery are junk!!
5,Caribbean Travel & Life,"I have not yet received this particular purchase since I currently have a subscription, and this was just an extension. However, I really love this magazine, and never let it expire."
1,Don't like it,I don't like this magazine. A lot of publicity and you don't learn that much from places to visit. Most of the places shown are for ultra rich$$$ people. I will not renew after my year is up
1,The worst Biology textbook I've read,"This is the new edition of a decent line of Biology books. The older edition (the one with the brown turtle) was pretty informative, and made most concepts pretty clear. Diagrams were helpful, and it got me through the class.THIS EDITION IS NOT THE SAME. This edition contains none of he useful diagrams, none of the information, and seems like they took out half the knowledge found in the old edition. This book is so heavily edited that most students will be struggling, even if they're trying to learn. If a student doesn't care, they have no chance of passing with this book."
2,It [stunk],"If you're a teacher wanting to buy this book, DON'T! It is so heavy, I would find any way I could not to have to shove the stupid thing in my backback. It does not explain things well,and it made freshman year accel. biology MISERABLE!"
2,What day is it?!,"This was a nice watch with lots of cool features. However, when we tried to set the day, date and time, the watch was out of sync. The automatic day of week setting did not agree with the date and year we entered. Huh??Also, the temp guage did not agree with our thermometer and when we reset it, it would not calibrate temperture changes properly. The altimeter also resets itself based on air-pressure, which did not seem to work well for us here in the high desert. We returned the watch to Amazon and are now a little gun-shy of buying another watch with these features."
5,More Fun Than a Rolex or Breitling!!! I've had both!,"What a cool watch! Plenty of features to play with. I use the temp/barometer daily. I use the timer 5-6 times a week..especially since my dryer timer is out! I use the compass frequently, and to impress friends. For $125, if it goes out, get another! Why buy a Rolex or Breitling (which I have stupidly to impress others), and they need 'tuning up' for $400-$500 every 5 years......? What am I missing here?"
1,"Total Cumulative Ascent, NOT.","I am a road cyclist. It is helpful to know a few things about a given ride: the distance, the speeds, and the total cumulative ascent. The total cumulative ascent (TCA) is the summation of the hill climbs for that day. For example, a ride of 100 miles on the flat is a whole lot easier than one of 10,000 feet TCA. I had a Casio watch which readily gave the TCA in 1998, unfortunately it was lost in Italy. I called Casio prior to purchase of a new one and was told that the Casio Pathfinder PAG40B would do the job. The watch does graph the altitude. However, after hours of trying to obtain the TCA using the instruction manual and a phone call to Casio it would appear it cannot be done. It is a shame; it is a good watch otherwise."
3,Casio Good but....,"Positives:1.Looks great!2.Fairly Accurate Barometer3.Compass is good to use, if accurately set...Negatives:1. Tempature readout inaccurate because its strapped to you, to get a accurate display you have to leave it off, which is impractical.2.Altimeter is shows I am -220ft and sometimes -500ft... I didn't realize New Jersey was below sea level, so the altimeter seems to be useless to me...Not sure how it is for others.3.The strap is ok, not so flexable...Looks like it will break before the watch...Not sure. Look for a metal or nylon strap maybe.---------------------------------------------------------I'll keep the watch, it took me a long time to decide to buy it or not. Would have to think long and hard if I had to make a similar choice again. Its not great nor is it bad. its FAIR.... 50/50."
3,Don't Know,I can't review this product because you wouldn't send it to me at the price stated on your website. You claimed it was a mistake and pulled the offer from out under me. You'll have to ask someone else.
4,(Review on any Tenchi TV),"I loved the Tenchi cartoons it was half DragonBall Z half Staw Warz.I loved Tenchi Muyo,Universe and Tokyo.It is about(If i remember right,i last seen it in 2002) a teenage lad who goes running and finds a cave and finds a magic sword(Think Light Sabre from Star Warz,Its exactly like one of those) and is grabbed into a world of extraordinary stuff he encounters a woman who later has a crush on him and she attacts him and he fight her with that Light Sabre like sword.Thats what i can only remember.I seen it on CartoonNetwork and C.N.X.(UK chanels).Though it was alot like Star Warz it was nearly as good as DBZ.Great cartoon to NE body who likes Str Wrz or DragonBall-Z"
4,tenchi muyo,"this series is absolutely great. its not exactly an action but more of a comedy/romance. I've only seen the uncut version (I hate edited versions of anime because sometimes they have to rework the plot and dialogue) and its definitely not something they would show on tv without editing. I've never seen the Toonami versions and quite frankly, I don't want to, knowing that they'll have to edit it for little kids to watch. From what I know they probably digitally edited the hot springs scenes or just totally cut them out for Toonami. And if they left it in, they'd have to change some of the jokes (which I really don't appreciate) and being a teenager, raunchy humor is what we're in to. So if you're looking for Tenchi Muyo, I'd recommend getting the original (uncut, unToonamified) ^_^"
5,Tenchi Muyo is awsome Anime!,"I love Tenchi Muyo and this DVD set was a God send! I spent over two hours looking for the best price on Tenchi Muyo,and this is it! I could only find VHS tapes that were $100.00,minimum! This is a DVD (the future) set and it's well under $100.00. I think you should buy this right NOW!"
5,A Must HAve for Any Dramatic Anime Fan,"All I can say is this DVD set really is very good. The Animation and Art are top notch and The Plot is extremely thick, so much that you may actually forget that this is a cartoon and not a sci-fi drama with real working actors ;) Well anyways I really liked all of the Tenchi Series' but this one gets me in the gut the most, Espicially with all of the mysterous background to each it leave reeling and asking questions for quite awhile.Get this DVD and enjoy what the Anime juadra's best has to offer."
2,Buggy buggy buggy,This software was a constant hassle from start to end. It did have some good ideas and the help files were well done but the software crashed constantly.Maybe I'll try to see if there is a fix somewhere before I return it to the store. Needs much improvement.
5,What a movie,"hi,i've seen this movie 6 times so far and i can't stop laughin about it. it is a great movie with a lot of very funny scenes. But the only thing I have to criticize: I guess it wasn't a good idea to write the story like that. I think it would have been better if the whole story had stayed in a chronological order, but on the other hand this movie so god [darn] good that i MUST give 5 Rating!I can advice everybody to see that movie. Just sit back, relax and laugh [...] from the seat :-)P.S. i hope you could understand what i wanted to say because i am german and my english isn't the best.Greetz,Chris"
3,MediaGab Review,"Ashton Kutcher and Brittany Murphy star in a hilarious comedy about a honeymoon that goes bad. Everyone thinks they are to young to marry but they convince them otherwise and walk down the isle. They embark on a European honeymoon. But when they get kicked out of a castle in France and things start to spiral downward from there.Just Married is one of those stupid comedies with a lot of slap-stick stunts. It was done better then I thought. The story line, yes there was a story, made sense and actually moved the story along.Don't be fooled by the Media Critics bad reviews of this movie, in my opinion they don't have a sense of humor and wouldn't know a comedy even if they saw it twice. I rate this movie a 3 out of 5 because it was funny comedy and because I don't feel it should score as high as Lord of the Rings. 3 is a good rating."
4,Good movie,We watched this movie a couple of yeas ago and enjoyed a lot. We decided to buy it and this was a good decision.
3,Chick flick with occasional moments,"Sometimes you have to watch your gal's picks...These two do have some chemistry, and there are moments of humor. But it's mostly a celebration of idiocy without the entertainment that might engender.Oh well..."
4,a surprisingly sweet comedy,"I honestly thought, when i saw the previews for ""Just Married"", that this would be one of those 'good for a few laughs, but rather forgetful' movies. i was more then pleasantly surprised. It manages to be two things very rarely found in the same movie; laugh-out-loud funny, and genuinely sweet.Ashton Kutcher convincingly breaks away from his ""Kelso"" persona from ""That 70's Show"", and the result is a truly funny performance that shows he truly deserves to be known as more then 'Demi's [boyfriend]'.The on-screen chemistry between Kutcher and Murphy works incredibly well, and they take us through the 'honeymoon from hell' with great energy and comic timing. This is a story about a couple almost too pretty to exist, but that you can't help but root for."
2,Blah,"I tried to watch this movie several times because I like Ashton Kutcher. I tend to like him in comedies with a larger point (""Guess Who"") or dramas with major points (""The Butterfly Effect""), but if I could watch ""Punk'd,"" then I should be able to watch this movie. However, I was bored with this one. I'm not a fan of Brittany Murphy. She was OK in ""8 Mile"" but I thought she was trying way too hard to be cutesy and sexy. It never seemed to come natural. Her acting is cool. She does the vulnerable scenes well, but it's everything else that didn't convince me. I did like Ashton's character. But the guy who kept following them around on their honeymoon just seemed to be more of a stalker than a concerned (and still in love) ex. I fell asleep through this movie several times before I barely got to the end. Can't say I recommend it but I wouldn't say it's terrible either."
4,"Good movie, but not the best","This was a really fun movie, although i have to say i was expecting more from them than that. But i did like it and i would give it a watch again if it was on. I dont know, maybe you have to see it twice to really like it...or maybe not"
3,Just Groovy,While this movie was short on laughs. This was a nicely-made movie with a great plot. The characters Tom and Sarah were realistically portrayed and the ending was fantastic. Brittany Murphy was my fave.
1,Horribly Un-Funny,"Some people may think this movie is funny I have to disagree. I think this was just a failed attempt to make lots of money by putting garbage on the screen. The jokes - not funny at all. I don't understand how saying ""Bonjour! Merci Bonjour! Merci!"" over and over again can make people actually laugh, or in fact crack a smile. I was going to turn this off but then I decided I would stay just to see what would happen at the end. If the movie was as dumb as I thought. Yeah, it was. Well actually it was dumber. Brittany Murphy and Ashton Kutcher have NO chemistry and are terrible in this movie. There were sick jokes and the way they showed the plot was just ... BAD. They could have done so much with the story line ..."
2,Health magazine for $5.00,I still have not receive my first issue. I really enjoy the magazine so I am looking forward to getting it.
5,This came REALLY fast!,"I already give this magazine 5 stars, and my first issue came within 4 weeks! This magazine has very useful information for health conscious people like myself."
3,Not Sure about this Magazine,"Just received my first copy of ""Health"". I was very dissappointed in it. Almost every page was ads. I was expecting some good articles that would encourage me want to eat healthy and watch my weight. This magazine did not do that! Of course, I have only received one copy, maybe next month's will be better."
2,beo wolf,i read the book but i need to check out the cliff notes so that i can study for a test tonight cause i turned in the book early and some one else checked it out of the librairy
5,Death and Capitalism in the Amazon Forest,"Márcio Sousa is one of the best brazilian writers of the present days. In this historic novel, the author portrays the construction of the railroad Wood-Mamoré, in the middle of the tropical forest, an ambitious work that involves deaths and corruption, in the beginning of the century XX, in the middle of the peak of the economy of the latex in Brazil. The romance also involves illustrations of the Brazilian politics and fictitious characters, as a native without hands explored as diversion. It's a great novel, touching and unforgettable."
2,no house sparrows,"the book is pretty and informative, but does not have ""house sparrows"" in it.i know they are a member of weaver finch family, but at least some info would have been good.i don't think i can return a book, but i would if i could."
5,Something different for a change,"I nearly went into shock in the aisle when I looked at this book and realized, lo and behold, it wasn't a Western romance nor, and this is the biggie, it wasn't set in England either.Wow. No overdone ""ton"" and the hero wasn't a Duke! I wantedto leap for joy. Are publishers finally beginning to realize there are readers, who would enjoy some variety after severalyears of not being offered much?Not only does the book have a interesting setting and time period but it is a great love story. I loved the hero andthe emotional pull of this story makes it a keeper. I think most romance readers will enjoy it, especially those who havetired of the usual English/Western stuff."
5,SEXIEST FAN,"First of all i must say i am so, so inlove with this man i think he is very talented and i'm not just saying this just because i love him, i have both cds and i liked force of nature alot, but when one man came out i just fell inlove with TANK even more. i listen to TANK's cd everyday. I know all his songs word for word. he has songs that you can relate to, if you feel like listening to some real meaningful music just pop TANK'S cd in and trust me you'll feel a whole lot better. whenever i'm in the car i listen to my TANK cd, whenever i'm on the train i listen to my TANK cd. i don't think i need to say anymore, just go get TANK'S cd it's worth it. OH AND ALSO HE IS THE FINEST THING IN PERSON."
5,An Excellent Novel,"This is a precusor to some of the more recent historical fiction by authors such as Margaret George. I picked this up as a kid in the used bin at a bookstore on Amsterdam Ave. and around 118th Street (near Columbia) for about 50 cents in 1978. This book was my first exposure to the Norman Conquest, but from an English point of view, and I re-read it once or twice in the next few years. Just recently, I picked it up again to see if it was as good as I remembered, and it stood up well. There are now many more sources of historical record regarding the Norman Conquest that are not weighted with the natural prejuicide of the conquerors (example: David Howarth's 1066 - The Year of the Conquest), but at the time, R. Sprague's book was an engrossing and entertaining precursor to those works."
4,It was wonderful,"It was wonderful, I never thought that it would arrive sooner than I thought and the movie was awesome."
2,"Is cutting off picture information ""Family friendly""?","Oh, Disney! Disney! Why do you stab me in the heart so often?This company seems to think that avoiding black little bars at the top and bottom of 4:3 television screens makes families happy and content. Why not consider us grownups instead, who are very saddened indeed to watch movies like this with the sides cut off?Besides, what child or teenager today would tolerate viewing this movie anyhow, cropped or in letterbox format? This is definitely a film for people BORN in the fifties and sixties. Yes, it's overlong! Yes, it's corny a lot of the time! Yes, it's often dull and even boring! And yes, I still enjoy it for all its faults! But I would be ten times happier if Disney had given me this film on DVD in the correct aspect ratio of 1.78:1 - with anamorphic enhancement, of course! WHEN WILL THEY LEARN?"
2,Was this trip necessary?,"Draggy family comedy about Americans on vacation abroad wasn't anywhere near top-drawer Disney when it was first released back in 1962--trite, unfunny and decidely kid-unfriendly with its tiresome bickering parents, dreary teen romance subplots and several bizarre un-Disneylike scenes involving drunkeness, a bidet, a French hooker, public urination and even a few mild four-letter words.It doesn't play any better today in an uncorrected color DVD transfer that frequently makes MacMurray, Wyman and other cast members look like corpses.One of the biggest live action misfires to be personally overseen by Walt Disney, this DVD edition (with no extras) is a bum trip. Stay home."
3,no brainer,"Good book to read on the beach or at the end of a hard day. It required little to no thought. The charaters are flat and the ending is obvious, but the story in general is amusing."
3,"three bedrooms, one corpse","""Three Bedrooms, One Corpse"" does not rank as one of my favorite Roe Teagarden mysteries. The plot was actually pretty silly in my opinion, & the book seemed to center more on Roe's relationship with Martin Bartell. Seeing that I don't particularly like Martin, I struggled to finish this book. I also feel that their relationship is ridiculous to a point."
1,Don't spend the time or money!,"This was one of the worst mysteries I've ever read. The writing was sloppy, the story bland, and the romance unrealistic. And without reading too closely, I caught two errors that an editor obviously neglected to correct. Ms. Harris refers twice to fixing a female cat as ""neutering"" and later in the book she sets a party up to begin, in one conversation, at 6:30 and in the next chapter at 7:30. This is a huge mistake in a mystery story! It leads the reader to expect something will happen as a result of someone getting the time of the party wrong. But it was just sloppy writing. Do yourself a favor and avoid Ms. Harris's novels."
3,"A tantalizing peek, but oh-so-little","The more I read of Charlaine Harris's books, the more I learn about life in small towns, and this book is no exception. I wish the seeding had been a little more blatant this time, since it felt very Agatha-Christie-like (and the scene at the realty conference as well as what Roe did after that was writer-pushing-story instead of character-pushing-story, IMHO), but I will make allowances.Point-of-note: Aurora Teagarden has far too many beaus for this to be realistic in any way, shape, or form. Just saying.What I wish had been in this book: more real estate stuff. However, this is a cozy mystery, not a real-estate howto."
3,Just Okay :(,"This one didn't reel me in. I finished it mostly because I already had time invested in it. I love her other books, this one didn't do anything for me."
4,great,I have just recently seen Gretchen Peters perform at the Tamworth Country Music Festival in Australia. I thought her voice was just fantastic and her music was great. I had never heard of her before and just happened to come accross her and thought she was really good. If she ever came out here again I would see her again. I can't wait to get this CD so I can listen to her at home.
3,too many ads,"I give this magazine as a gift, and the recipient says there are good articles, but way too many advertisements."
3,Too many ads,I love this magazine but I am disappointed that the last half of the magazine is mostly ads. I expected more articles or pictures but still all in all it is a decent magazine about dogs.
1,Rip-off!,"I ordered and paid for this magazine in April. Still no magazine FIVE months later! I was forced to rate this magazine with a ""1"", I would have given it a ""o"", since you can't rate something you haven't seen!"
2,"Nice pictures, not much substance...","I had always wanted to subscribe to this magazine after seeing it in stores and I was able to get a very cheap subscription rate through Amazon, but after a year of it, I decided to cancel.The best part of this magazine is all the pictures of happy dogs. Unfortunately, that is about all this magazine offers.The articles aren't very interesting or informative and the magazine itself does not have a lot of content or interesting features. You can find a lot more and better dog articles on the internet."
4,Great Album But Some Of The Songs Sound So Sad,"I don't know if Dave was sad when he made this album, but as a listener some of the songs sound so sad to me. They are still beautiful regardless, so get your copy as soon as possible."
2,Worthless,"This ""pen"" does not change easily at all. You have toline up this then push that then ull get the point you want. The stylus is flimsy. I agree with Denis, Im sending this back and shopping around for a much better one."
3,Hard Kiss,This is without a doubt the hardest album Kiss ever released.It's been said many times but I'll say it again...great drum sound from Eric Carr!The title tune as the opening number is cool as well as I love It Loud and I Still Love You.Some of the songs however are pretty annoying like Keep Me Commin
5,"""I LOVE IT LOUD""","This Album Is A No Holds Barred Back To Form, It's Kiss At There Heaviest Most Darkest Hour. Although, The Songs Required Help From Some Friends, Kiss End Up With An Album That In My View Blows Away Anything They Had Down Before Or After. Also, Something That I Must Shine On Is Eric Carr's Drumming...It Is Immensely Loud, Dark, And Intense...I've Never Heard Drums Stick Out On An Album As Much As They Do Here, and Let Me Tell You The Drums Are Amazing Here, They Prove Just How Underrated Eric Carr Was. Creatures Of The Night, Is Kiss's Finest Hour."
4,For hard-core fans this is a very nice package,"You aren't likely to be looking at this page if you aren't a hardcore Matthew Sweet fan. This combines tracks from his 1986 album (likely to stay out of print), his 1989 album for A&M (also hard to find), along with impossible to find early tracks from his studio duo Buzz of Delight. The Buzz of Delight tracks included sound much more like the Matthew Sweet of later years than the synth-drum machine phase he went through later. There are also tracks from an - again - impossible to find 12 inch promo that was released just before A&M dropped him; it included early versions of ""Divine Intervention"" and ""Silent City."" And, the track with Michael Stipe (as ""Community Trolls"") will make you wish Matthew had stayed in Athens a little longer. This isn't the place to start for a potential Matthew Sweet fan, but is well worth the money for long-time fans - even if you already have dug up ""Inside"" and ""Earth."""
2,"Has Energy, But Mostly Forgettable","I remember having the cassette of Animalize years ago and listening to some of the songs. Of course now I have the CD. While this isn't the greatest album, it does have some energy. Almost all of the songs are forgettable though--just don't leave much of an impression. Lick it Up is a little better than this album. ""Heavens on Fire"" is the standout track. I give this album actually 2.5 stars."
3,Mark Who?,"With KISS refueling their career with albums like Creatures Of The Night and Lick It Up, Animalize keeps the chops up to snuff. Now in the mist of finding the right lead guitarist, Mark St. John continues what Vinnie Vincent did on Lick It Up but is kept on a short leash by Gene and Paul. Also with Gene Simmons knee deep in his new movie career, Paul is the star on this album. Left with repolishing Gene's songs like ""Burn Bitch Burn"" and ""While The City Sleeps"", Paul and Company rip out hard rockers like ""I've Had Enough"", ""Under The Gun"", and ""Get All You Can Take"". This album only contains 9 songs and could of used a song with Eric Carr on vocals which would have been a treat for KISS fans, but with the 2 rockin' singles, ""Heaven's On Fire"" and ""Thrills In The Night"", this album will definately please a metalhead from the 80's."
1,Worst Kiss album ever,"I am a huge Kiss fan- I like and own all their albums-except this one bites. It is complete rubbish from start to finish and it is an embarassment to Gene and Paul as well as their fans. Asinine, juvenile lyrics make them (read GENE) sound like a 12 year old with his first Playboy and the songs are all plain uninspired and mediocre. ""Under The Gun"" is the second worst Kiss song of all time, second to ""No No No"" off of Crazy Nights. (Which is a good album)."
3,Paul Stanley takes charge!,"Not my favourite Kiss record but ""Animalize"" has some classic material from the great 80's Kiss era.The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because of the filler which is no stranger to most Kiss albums. Best tracks for me on here are ""Heavens On FIre"", ""Burn Bitch Burn"", ""Thrills In The Night"" & ""Muder In High Heels"".One of Kiss's heavier releases but lacks depth, probably due to Gene's waning interest in the group to becoming an actor instead hower this dosent really bother me as Paul is without doubt the most talented and best member of Kiss...he steps up and produces the record well!"
5,You gotta try this game,"You have to try this game, out, for all of you that have rogue spear this is the greatest edition. Tons of new maps, 4 new guns, and new suits (like the green bio-hazard uniform). This game is better (and harder) than ever. Taking place in London, Venice, Turkey, and Hong Kong, are only a few places the new maps are located in, mean while you must operate, in densely poplulated areas, with innocent bystanders. I was WOWED when i first played it. Oh, by the way, for all you programmers out there, the game does come back with a RSE (Rogue Spear Editor) but changed the name to UOE (Urban Operations Editor) of course, where you can edit levels, guns, and even soldiers and terrorists. Definitly worth the money if you already have ""Rogue Spear"""
3,Good overall,"This is a good book overall. It gives you 5 words a day, uses them all in a paragraph, lists the pronunciations, has you complete 5 sentences with the words, and then finishes with a multiple choice quiz, which matches the words to the definitions.Unfortunately, the definitions are frequently overly simplified. The definitions listed are great if you want a minimal and general meaning of the word, but for many words the definitions are inadequate if you want the full meaning of the words.I use online dictionaries to supplement this book. I do this book's exercises to get a general meaning of the word, and to see how they are used, and then I check the online dictionaries to get the full definition. I prefer merriam-webster.com and thefreedictionary.com. They are both excellent sites to use in addition to the book."
5,What a steal!,"Like everyone has said, they are great for the price, but you do need a sub to make up for the high cut off in the frequency response. I plan on buying some higher quality speakers in 5 years or so, but for now, these suit me just fine. I'm considering buying another set of them to have music through out my house instead of just in the family room..."
3,A cheap set to get you started on,"I got these as my first set of theater speakers because it was all I could afford at the time. The served me well, but there are definitely much better speakers out there. These sound muddy and flat and there is no bass response, esp. at lower volume levels. I did notice that when you turn the volume way up, they start sounding better, but since I lived in an apt. at the time, I couldn't usually do that. That being said, I defy anyone to find speakers priced at about $15 a piece that sound as good as these do. Just make sure you get a subwoofer.Why I rated it the way I did:If there was a 3 1/2, I would have done that. Going by sound alone, I'd give these 2 stars (I have certainly heard worse). When you factor in the price, however, you gotta' give it another star or 2."
4,A Classic that's as fresh today as it was when first written!,"I first read ""City"" when I was 15 years old, and the themes and message of this superb Sci/Fi-Fantasy has remained with me my entire life. I love this book; it's that simple. To have it in a Hardback Anniversary version is a huge Bonus. There's an Epilog Chapter that wasn't in the original paperback version that I read all those years ago, and it's Very good!I recommend this Novel to both young, new fans of the Genre, and to us ""Old Timers"", too."
4,Great Supplemental Text,I use this book with my fourth year High School Spanish class. I have been using it for 3 years and have found it to be an excellent basis for conversation practice. The content in most of the chapters is interesting to the students so they enjoy talking about the subjects and learning the vocabulary by using it in real discussions. It's a buy!
5,"YOUNG ADULTS, OLD LADIES, A BOOK FOR EVERYONE","You've probably read all the other reviews, so I won't rehash them. What really is admirable about the Abarat books, aside from the storyline and the paintings and everything else, is that Clive Barker has given kids a landscape in which everyone is acceptable and welcome. Abarat is replete with freaks and outcasts who are all part of the normal culture. This is, I believe, a very important if somewhat occulded message. Whoever you are, even if you are orange and have elephant ears, you are valuable and necessary.Since everything else important has been said about this book, just thought I'd throw that in. There are cultural messages here which lie beneath all the rapturous fantasy, and Mr. Barker has done a wonderful job in delivering them."
5,"Long lasting, non-irritating","I've used this for 15 years or more, and wondered if it had changed with the new packaging, but after using the new package, it seems to be the same quality. Good stuff, and even in Florida heat in the summertime, it will last weeks with a single application. (at least for me, and I sweat a lot!) It's not an antiperspirant, so it doesn't clog your pores, but simply prevents bacteria from forming and creating the smell associated with underarms."
1,Too good to be true....,"The old adage, ""If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is,"" is perfectly applicable to Lavilin. I researched this product and read the reviews here (among others) and decided to try it with a positive attitude. To be fair, Lavilin is better than nothing in that it offers very, very minimal protection against odor as opposed to using nothing at all. However, after weeks of use I have come to find that eight to ten hours is as far as any real deoderant protection lasts, after that the least bit of excercise, etc., causes a significant increase in underarm odor that is very noticeable. Daily application is necessary, and that coverage is marginal at best. Yes, I followed the application instructions TO THE LETTER. I think the rave reviews for Lavilin are mostly due to wishful thinking. My recommendation is do not be taken in by this modern version of Snake Oil."
1,Didn't work for me....,"It didn't work for me. I wanted to, I expected it to, but it just didn't. Before I first used this product, I stayed away from using aluminum deodorant for almost one month. I applied this to myunderarm, it gave off a not so good odor. It made me sweat, and sweat mixed with this product is hell. But still I decided to give it one more chance. I used this for more almost 2 months, noting really happened. I guess this is one of the products that is not meant for me. After all this, I have never used any anti-perspirant/deodorant at all. I just sometimes rub alcohol or Purell on my underarms when I know I started to sweat. That kinda worked for me, and Im sticking to it."
5,The Perfect Case,This is the perfect case for my Handspring Vior Deluxe. I got it in blue and it not only looks great but it is easy to use and protects my Visor from damage and fits right in my pocket or the pouch on my saddle bag. Great case!
4,Great looking bag for your PDA,Bought this bag when on a trip to the US. It's by far the best looking case for my Cassiopeia 105. I have tossed my old wallet and callender completely now. This was my final step in leaving my paperagenda. The only bad thing to say is actually that it was difficult to find out which case from Incase designs that was suiteble for the Cassiopeia. The store acctually suggested a smaller case as this was the one suggested on the Incase designs webpage.
1,Rigged?,"I think this book is a personal rant passing as something to inform readers about American Indians. Can anyone become an American Indian by reclaiming an identity she denied her whole life and then writing as if she represents American Indians? To me that is strange. My observation is that the three ravingly positive reviews are so vague about the book's actual contents that one can't help feeling that they were solicited by the author's friends. The one negative review was, by contrast, very detailed and seems to have been unsolicited!"
5,She's alright with Me!!,"I first heard about Shirley Horn when I bought the CD, ""Here's to Life"", and promptly dismissed it, to my regret. I don't have it any longer. Lately, thanks to watching the Jazz series, I have been checking out the works of the great jazz masters, and came across this CD, and don't regret getting it. ""You better love me while you may"", and ""The Best Is Yet to Come"" will probably be my favorites on this CD. ""Why Don't You Do Right"" is another favorite. Now, this lady has one great voice, and delivers a heck of a punch in my opinion. I guess the opinion of what you have and make do with it applies in this instance. At any rate, this CD is worth the stars it gets and then some. Hats off to Ms.Horn for this spectacular CD."
2,nice material but no instructional photos,"The material of the item was very soft but there were no instructional photos that came with it. It is very hard to figure out how to get this item to actually look like a shirt. I loved the pics online but if they could have sent a few pics or written instructions, it would have made this a really nice piece. As of right now, I just have a really nice piece of material with a couple straps"
1,Disappointing,"We love these crackers, and are hard to find in grocery stores. So I was delighted to find them available here, but so disappointed when we discovered they were all stale."
3,Worse than Japanese Version,"This version of Shiryu is nothing compared to Japanese version action figure. The quality is not very good, just okay. Since it is the only kind of action figure of Saint Seiya you can find in America, I give it 3 stars(Otherwise I would rate it 2 stars)."
3,Industrial age mediocrity,"KDC are a decent goth-industrial band on this CD. The musicianship is very good and the the sound is nice and crisp. I would have liked the guitars to have been a little louder and I wish the singer could actually sing some instead of talk or yell everything. The songwriting needs to be stronger though. Many songs started out really well, but ended up sounding the same as the previous song by the middle of it. These guys are good musicians but the song writing and maybe even the fire of their performance don't match Nine Inch Nails or Ministry's best work."
3,More focused on the editor than on the food,"A few years ago, the editor, Dana Cowin, covered her own wedding in the magazine--the height of tackiness, in my opinion, for a magazine that supposedly portends good taste. The recipes have been better in the last few issues than they have in years past--in other words, I have found them more accessible, more down to earth, while still retaining the excellence and quality for which the magazine rightly strives. It's losing its arrogant and aloof edge, which is a move in the right direction."
2,the most over-rated food magazine,"I subscribed to Food & Wine for a while and was continuously disappointed. The articles are on the superficial side and more importantly a lot of the recipes and product reviews are not as well researched as they should have been. I experienced more than one flop trying their stuff. The magazine tries very hard to be trendy and pick up the latest and greatest in the cooking and restaurant scene without being careful enough in deciding what is actually an important or meaningful trend rather than a fad. This magazine can't hold a candle to ""Bon Appetit"" or ""Gourmet""."
5,The Queen of Attolia,The writer does a fantastic job of creating a real page turner. Her locations and pseudo-histories and mythologies make the book both highly engaging and extremely believable.
3,Fun Book!,This book will keep you interested from start to finish. It is written in a style that anyone can appreciate. I truely enjoyed the main character Henderson and his frank thinking and ideas throughout the book.
4,Unparalleled character development,"First off, if you are impatient with books don't count on being able to endure the first 100 pages of this book. The book moves at a tortoise pace, but this technique that Bellow utilizes is not in vain. Eugene Henderson is a very complex protagonist and if the book moved too swiftly it would become difficult to portray Eugene in his entirety. The bottom line is if you want to read a book that does a great job of character development and complexity, this is the book for you. If you are looking for a fast paced, action filled book this is probably not the book for you."
1,"Yep, a definite bootleg. Avoid at all costs!","I had the unfortunate displeasure of purchasing this DVD set a long time ago, only to realize I had been completely ripped off. The case it came in was flimsy and the cover art was done with a standard ink jet printer. Insulting really. The quality of the show suffered immensely too, looking horribly compressed. Not to mention there were only 3 discs, which explained the quality, but also proved it was a fake since a show with this many episodes usually has more than 3.I didn't buy this set off of Amazon, but I figured I would do my part to make sure the people responsible for this don't get another cent our of money for their shoddy products. Make a stand and research your anime to make sure you are getting the correct DVD sets."
5,Chobits,This is possibly the best anime I have seen. It begins lite and humorous then moves into more serious plot. Eash episode leaves you hanging and you can't wait to watch the next. This is an excellent buy and worth every penny of its price.
3,"Not Really ""Smoked Salmon""","This is a cool device and the end result is tasty BUT if you think you are going to end up with smoked salmon like you buy in the store (as we did) you will be disappointed. It ""smokes"" salmon but it does not make smoked salmon."
2,Save your money,"I've owned a Cameron stove top smoker for a long time, used it occasionally, and never have thought it is worth the trouble and mess. It is virtually impossible to make smoke-free, so unless you have a really good stove hood, don't even think about it. It would be a good device to take on an outing where you're going to cook outdoors, however, either over a camp grill or with a portable stove, and the smokiness of the environment is not a concern. It is really hard to clean once you use it and the wood powders available to use with the smoker are pretty expensive. I smoked fresh caught fish of all types for many years using a standard electric smoker, so I am not a newbie at this, but if you are going to use it indoors, don't bother unless you like a smoky kitchen and a really messy kitchen contraption to deal with afterwards."
2,Mixed emotions,"Purchased this and waas excited to try it. I cooked a salmon filet in it using the hickory chips. The salmon was excellent and everyone loved it. The bad news is that my house filled with smoke. This is not an indoor smoker!! Too much smoke escapes when you cook with it. I will be using it outdoors on my grill. While the food it cooks is pretty good, I only rated it 2 stars because it is not an indoor smoker. My house smells like smoke...and not in a good way. I also tried adjusting it as per the instructions to make it seal better but it didn't help.I would have rather applied the money towards a decent outdoor smoker had I known this was not suitable for indoor smoking."
3,"Not so certain about the ""indoors"" part!","Ok, well, first let's say that this does work exactly as explained. However in spite of one's best efforts to keep the smoke contained inside the smoker, invariably the smoke leaks out. The directions suggest ""tweaking"" the top for a better seal, but it's not airtight no matter what you do. I tried placing foil around the edges to reduce the smoke inside the house, but that didn't work either. I really think this is best suited for use on top of one's outdoor grill -- unless you really like having your home smell like an open campfire for days. The other issue is with clean up. You want to make certain that you do wrap the drip pan in aluminum foil. I'd also recommend you line the bottom, where you place the wood chips with foil -- because as the chips char, they will imbed and seal themselves to the bottom of the stainless steel pan, and no amount of scrubbing will get them off."
1,Awful!,"I bought this stovetop smoker because my daughter loves smoked salmon and I thought it would be easier and less expensive to make in my stove instead of buying at the store. The product itself worked exactly as it was supposed to, but the meat, (chicken and fish) tasted like someone had put their cigarette out in our food. You will not be able to achieve the same results of an actual smoker using this product."
2,Smoker is a good name for it.,"I was given this for my birthday and have used it once. I tried using it on the stove but the entire kitchen smelled of smoke for a day afterwards. I expected some odor afterwards but not as much as I got. Maybe I didn't use it correctly but am now afraid to try it again. I have a large drum smoker and a gas grill, I'll probably just stick to them for now."
5,Cameron Smoker,"Well made and heavy construction. Arrived with a dent, and minus the sample smoke chips. Customer Care sent a replacement and a return slip for the damaged one with no hassles.My cousin has one of these and loves it, so I bought it knowing I couldn't use it on my ceramic cooktop, hoping to use in the oven as other reviwers have suggested. This did not work for me; the chips never smoked. I guess they really need the direct contact heat."
4,LOVE IT,Easy to use and clean and it works great. My husband makes the best smoked foods out of it. The only problem is that the drip pan warped after two uses. Otherwise great product.
5,Don't hesitate!,"I read all the reviews about this smoker. All the good reviews were exactly correct. All the bad reviews make me think some don't read instructions or expect something that the product is incapable of delivering.This smoker does exactly was is says. First, I chose super saver shipping which usually takes a while to deliver...Thank you Amazon it was delivered in 4 days. And secondly, I've already smoked chicken, pork chops, salmon, yummy!! Easy to do, easy to clean. Yes, there was a little smoke escaping, but there's ""tweaking"" instructions for what to do in that case. I found it easiest to cover the entire smoker with a wet dish towel (big enough to drape the edge a little). It has been fun experimenting with the sample wood chips and the cookbook was also helpful. It will get blackened; it tells you it will. For easy clean up they recommend using foil in the drip tray, it works. I love kitchen gadgets especially when they perform...this one won't let you down!"
4,Stovetop Smoker,I have never used a stovetop smoker so I cannot compare it to others on the market. All I can tell you is that I was very satisfied with this one. It produces very little smoke and does not smell up my house. I made a brisket in this and it was in use for 4 hrs. and I could not tell it was on my stove. The flavor was good but a little strong for my liking. I think just by cutting down on the smoker chips I could rectify that problem. I did find that for me it is one of those novelty items you have in you kitchen's and don't really use that often. Kind of like the bread maker's they came out with about 10 years ago.
2,CHEAP CASH IN,"KISS TAKES OFF THE MAKE UP BUT DOES IT COUNT IF IT IS ONLY GENE AND PAUL, IT IS A TOTAL GYP TO INJECT LIFE INTO A SAGGING RECORDING DEAL, POOR SALES ON BOTH UNASKED AND THE ELDER PLUS MODERATE SALES ON CREATURESOF THE NIGHT CAUSE THE SEMI-KISS TO REMOVE THE MAKE UP THE MUSIC IS AS WEAK AS THE IMAGE CHANGE, mOST BANDS CAN BLOW FART BUBBLES IN THE BATH WITH MORE MELODIES THAN THIS ALBUM, PASS THIS ONE UP BUY ROCK N ROLL OVER AND DESTROYER INSTEAD"
4,Unmasked and Crunchy!,"After the failure of the tenth aniversary tour (except in South America),Kiss felt that the makeup angle had run it's course,and a new approach was needed.LICK IT UP with it's cover of a ""natural"" Kiss in street clothes peeked the fans' curiousity and brought many back into the fold.This album continues the crunch of CREATURES OF THE NIGHT.Gene proves that one could be a sleazy demon without the makeup,on FITS LIKE A GLOVE,ON THE EIGHTH DAY,NOT FOR THE INNOCENT and DANCE ALL OVER YOUR FACE.Paul strikes with LICK IT UP,EXCITER and A MILLION TO ONE.Eric supplies the thunder per usual.the only songs that don't work is that damn rap song of Paul's,ALL HELL'S BREAKIN'LOOSE and GIMMIE MORE.This release is a good follow up to CREATURES OF THE NIGHT."
4,Now we know why she and Justin broke up,"Listen to this song closely, and she provides insight on her breakup with Justin. This song fills in some blanks about the breakup, which both have described as painful. She sings that she may have made a mistake (""I may have made it rain/Please forgive me""); then she says she gave in to her weakness (i.e., men like the one she ran off to Vegas with); she apparently asked for forgiveness but he refused, and she is haunted by Justin now. Now apparently he completely ignores her, and she doesn't feel like she can experience love again (without him).This is a great song, and the remixes give the song even more power. Note that this single contains only SOME of this song's remixes, so look around if you want every remix."
4,PERFECT PRIVATE PIRATES,"A great book to read. Main character John Trenchard who is 15 years old is very heroic. I'd really recommend this book to any age because its very adventurous. If you like secrets, nasty people and betrayal then this is the right book for you. Full of description, it puts an image into your head and you can't put it down.It is set in Moonfleet.Some archaic words that may not be understandable since the book is old but the plot is fantastic.The only thing you'll have to realise is that it takes along time to get into the main story. Basically, John finds his true friends who he trusts to be PRIVATE PIRATES. Also John tries to discover the secret behind Blackbeard who is dead and was a pirate. Blackbeard hides a diamond before he dies which still belongs to him today........"
4,"Killers is a great Hits package, but....","The song selection could've been a bit better. For example, ""King of the Night Time World"" ""Strutter"" & ""Calling Dr. Love"" should've replaced ""Cold Gin"" ""Love Gun"" & ""Sure Know Something"" but, oh' well. Killers is still worth having especially the Japanese version or better yet the Australian version which includes ""Talk To Me"" instead of ""Escape from the Island"""
5,Timely Book,"Amazing never before published transcripts of Gurdjieff's meetings. Excellent book. There are few books that one reads that stay with you for a lifetime---this is such a book. And, its timeliness couldn't be more appropriate given the current world condition."
1,punch design software is an absolute deception,"Extremely overpriced - customer service is terrible - real stupid looking library items - no good for cement block design or calculations - it's all about framing - has an inconvenient ruler for measuring and it disapears if you scroll up or down - oh, so many other unfriendly moves you need to do till you get to where you want to, if you get there...Knowing what I know now, after using this software, I would NEVER have paid $220 for it - For some 3D ""play"" the MOST it's worth is $19 to me."
1,Pirated copies of another company's videos,"This type of bargin bin video is the kind that has given Silent Film a bad name.This DVD set poorly presents another video company's video releases, too.Some of the movies are even sourced from old VHS tapes.Absolute junk.This boxed set will turn off any first time viewer of silent films.I recommend to just stay away from this."
2,History of the Goths,"Over 50% of this book is bibliography. Despite the title, it is not written in a history book format. The books exams in deep detail many facits of the Goths i.e. the first chapter exams the meaning of the word ""gens."" Reading this book is hard work and a challenge. It is difficult to put the facts, as layed out by the author, in a historical time-line."
2,Disappointed,"UPDATE: Have only had this ball for a few days and it's already starting to come apart.Was looking to add another ball to my pups collection. He loves the one he has now but I got it years ago and can't find another like it. This one is a great size for him (14 lbs) but it's almost impossible for him to get it to squeak. Even I have a hard time. It's also not as ""plush"" as I was hoping. It definitely softer than a tennis ball would be, but not as soft as I would like. He still loves playing with it, but prefers his old softer and squeakier one."
2,not so good,"I downloaded this on my Tivo through Amazon Unbox and was not happy with the film. Yes it was a classic, but not my taste."
4,Suits our needs well.,"We're getting older, and like to tent camp, but prefer sleeping on cots rather than air mattresses or pads, so a 10 x 10 tent is a necessity. What drew us to this tent was the canopy...it's difficult to find a modestly priced tent with a canopy to drain water away beyond the sides and base of the tent, but this one does rather nicely. The low side air vents are great, offering superb circulation on warm days and nights. We're very happy with our purchase. Thank you Columbia.PS The skylights make stargazing extra fun."
5,Keep their heads ringin,"I love Friday, Next Friday, and even Friday after Next. Of course it gets less funny as you go through the sequels, but they're still good. Great to watch when it's Friday, you aint got no job, and you aint got s*** to do!"
5,Love these shows,"Love Ice Cube! Love ""Next Friday"" =) I wanted all 3 shows and this pack was a good way to get them. Amazon.com has always been my best bet for internet shopping."
1,"Movie is great, but the dvd is BUNK","Don't get me wrong, i can watch this movie any day of the week and multiple times a day. Friday is one of the funniest movies ever made... one thing... This ""widescreen"" DVD is not really widescreen, it is the full screen version with the bottom and the top blackened out, to give you the effect that it is actually widescreen. This really made me mad and i hope that if you do buy this DVD, it is for the extras and not for the movie. You should also have a copy of the VHS version because it shows more of the movie. I urge everyone who has both versions to check this out and complain to the company"
1,BAD!!!!! HORRIBLE!!!!,Payed for the first friday and got the second one inside instead!!! horrible!!!! How do you confuse the second movie with the first??
1,painfully boring,"I thought this movie was supposed to be funny and entertaining, but it was neither. It was so painfully boring that about 40 minutes in I couldn't watch any more. Ice Cube & Chris Tucker are capable of being funny, but good comedic actors can't compensate for a rotten screen play and poor direction."
5,One Great Party Movie,"After I saw this for the first time, I didn't really appriciate how funny it was. Then after i saw it again and again, I began to realize that it has to be one of the funniest movie's I've seen. This is the type of movie you put on when you have nothing to do, or with a bunch of friends, because it is every entertaining. Chris Tucker delivers a great preformance, and who can forget the immortal phrase ""And you know this, man!"". This movie is a must see for anyone who wants to laught their.....off."
1,Too much long puases on extra lines/scenes,"I bought this DVD 3 days ago at Best Buy thinking it would be the original copy (the one with the yellow cover) and it totally sucked! I guess they added the deleted scenes. There were too many boring long puases between the actors' lines. The original yellow covered copy is much better. It had a better flow during their lines. I would highly recommend NOT TO BUY this copy/edited. Buy the original or buy the Ice Cube 4 movies in 1 DVD. Much better value. I think i seen on here for $10 and the yellow covered ""Friday"" movie is in there.Ice Cube Collection: 4 Film Favorites"
4,THI IS THE SHITTTT!!,THIS MOVIE IS FOR EVERONE THAT HAS A HAPPY LIFE.THERE IS ALWAYS A PLAYER HATER!!!!!TAKE THIS INFO FROM THE GODFATHER DADDY HITT!!!
2,all advertising,"this magazine is a fantastic collection of information about new products and places to go. It advertises in the form of articles. like most magazines today it covers products related to the hobby. So if you want to know more about sleeping bags, hiking sticks, hiking trails, etc. this is the magazine for you. The pictures are handy for a kid to cut out when doing one of those lame homework assignments. got it for 5 dollars and I see it is 5 dollars again. Wait for that deal. don't spend more than that. It isn't worth it. For a good magazine about stratagy, go for ""boys life"". It is an all around good magazine for kids and adults."
1,Backpacker magazine unscrupulous subscription campaign,"Backpacker Magazine is sending unwanted subscriptions to people who apparently just click once on the wrong ad. I was searching the internet for local topo maps when a window opened thanking me for the subscription to Backpacker magazine. I closed the window, cleared cookies and cache. A few days later I received a bill for the subscription mailed to my home !! And I am not the only one falling prey to this unscrupulous subscription campaign. A quick search on the net will reveal many other victims as well. I urge anyone thinking about subscribing to this magazine to think otherwise."
3,This magazine has lost a bit in the past couple years....,"This magazine used to be a great resource for hard core bakcpackers with articles about transcendent survival stories and epic backpacking opportunities all over the world. In the past couple years they have changed their format drastically and have focused on ""regional"" editions and over the top gadget and gear coverage for total gear-wonks.Don't get me started on the useless monthly section entitled ""Social Climber"" where people write into to ask what's socially acceptable on the trail with regard to fashion and things of that nature. You are backpacking for crying out loud...who cares?It seems to have lost some of its humanity and original vision. I have subscribed to this mag for about 10 years and I used to be able to read it cover to cover, now I am lucky if there is one or article worth reading."
5,The only choice really,"No other outdoor magazine comes close to Backpacker to answer the questions of where to go and what to take. There are more destination suggestions in a year than one could ever visit in a lifetime, all with accompanying directions, notes, climate, visitation levels, etc.When it comes to gear, the editors work hard to keep quality AND cost in mind and are careful to test less-well-known, but worthy brands. This is a departure from other outdoors mags that seem to sell recommendations to high retail price manufacturers. Backpacker even did a review of the gear available in large discount stores..."
4,Shenandoah,Good movie as are most movies with James Stewart. I was watching it mainly to get a better understanding of some of the attitudes of people during the Civil War. It certainly gave me that although I am not sure I would rate it in the top 10 of the movies about people caught up in this War as some others have.
5,It is James Stewart what more can I say.....Wonderful,Anything with James Stewart is good. He is a great actor and would have no problem getting everything he is in. I love this and Mr Smith goes to Washington.
5,great movie,certainly did enjoy the movie. wish they would make more of these good movies. love most westerns of that era.
4,For civil war buffs,"This is a civil war story. I first saw this film in the 1960's in the theater and loved it. It stars James Stewart, Patrick Wayne (yes, the Duke's son) Katherine Ross and my personal favorite Doug McClure, may he rest in peace. The ending is especially poinantI just had to have this film on DVD."
5,Great resource,This book has been such an asset to me in all forms of writing. I feel much more confident in my ability to communicate more clearly through my writing.
1,ANSWERS NOT PROVIDED!,"Appears to be a good exercise book, but ""big problem"" you have no idea if you are right or wrong. No answer list is provided. buyer beware."
5,Baby Loves it!,"I bought this for my niece. After a short review of the instructions, she had it out of the bag, put it on and was walking around with her 3 mo. old baby in it, all within 10 minutes. Based on what I saw, it appeared to be VERY easy to use. The baby seemed in awe of his new ""view"" of the world. After a ""quality check"" from approx. 5-6 family members, the wrap was deemed ""safe"" and ""really cool!"" You cannot beat the price. The color options are plentiful and the cotton is very soft. I am buying another one for a cousin who is expecting in a couple of months."
2,Ninety-nine tracks of noise...,"Well, this CD has a few bright moments (the album cover being one of them). Some of the actual songs (which are all clumped near the beginning) aren't so bad in a thrashy/noisy/industrial-ish vein, but after that it's just samples galore for about the next eighty tracks. Some of the samples and their manipulation of such are amusing, but it gets boring...really boring after about twenty minutes or so (mind you, the album runs about seventy-one minutes total). If you really like noise or samples by the metric tonne, then this might be an enjoyable CD for you. But if that concept scares you, well, you'd better just run away now..."
3,Is this what your really looking for?,"Flex is a great magazine. I'm not afraid to say it, but what I am afraid to say is that every person in this magazine is on about a thousand dollar a month steroid budget. I liked the training tips given, however, and I think that the routines are well-rounded, and give people much more muscle. If you are an incredibly intense musclehead, then this magazine is for you. If you are intrested in looking good rather then having ""sick"" biceps then try a magazine like Muscle and Fitness, a more fitness diversified magazine."
2,Not the easiest,"This stopwatch has an amazing array of functions but is difficult to use; sometimes it behaves erratically and starts timing up instead of counting down, or starts all over again when the countdown is only half done. Don't know if it's really misbehaving or it's just on some obscure other function when I think I set it for countdown...? Operating manual is available online pdf, and it's several pages long."
1,dont waste your money,"I purchased the watch as I needed a timer, stopwatch and clock. The advertisement said it had a clock, nada!, The stopwatch function did not always turn off, The timer function was not that great. I sent the watch back to the manufacturer and purchased a prosurvivor 601x great stopwatch and clock and a s3magt timer. These work great. Dont waste your money on the above."
3,Beware if you have small hands!,"I bought this and then had to return it, as it was too large to fit in my hand comfortably, and push the buttons along the top. I am a 5'5"" caucasian woman and have never thought of myself as having particularly small hands, but trying to use this stopwatch was really uncomfortable. Honestly, I don't know how functional it was otherwise, as I never got past the size problem..."
2,Definitely not my cup of tea,I have to say that I found this book to be quite boring. i've been laid up for a few weeks. I have a Kindle so have been able to read and enjoy many of the classics. This was a book i had to stop reading several times and always wondered why i returned to it. I will try something else by Fitzgerald from his later years. I won't give up on someone others consider a brilliant writer.
3,Boring novel beautifully written,"All purchases from Amazon have been outstanding, received in timely fashion and priced well. I have bought kindles, books, a dslr camera and other items. Thanks Amazon."
2,Shallow,"My thoughts on this first, autobiographical novel of Fitzgerald's are a little mixed. On the one hand, I strangely loved the gimmicky and unusual narrative format, with its headlined asides to the audience and occasional screenplay-style dialogue. The writing style is fast and easy to read. But, in the end, the cons far outweighed the pros for me. Plot is nonexistent, a flaw which works when the characterization is strong and compelling, but Amory Blaine failed utterly to connect with me, and the minor characters were ciphers to the point that I had a hard time even remembering who was who. The inevitably formative war years were glossed over, and all the reader is left with are meta ramblings on literature and socialism. Certainly not the worst book I've ever read, but not very redemptive either."
4,My Side of Paradise,"I thought this book was amazing! F. Scott Fitzgerald really has a way to write a book! I love the way the book is formatted (into 3 different books). Also, in the book, two lovers write each other letters in which is showed in the book in letter format. I love the highly intense vocabulary used also. I think this is a great read for any of those literature loving people. :)"
1,horrible,"Don't think I'm stupid or don't get the ""Roaring 'Twenties""... let me just tell you why it sucks.Here goes: first of all, everyone in the book writes poetry. I don't even know why I bring this up first, but it bugs me. It's just like everyone reflects Amory. The only good one was by his friend who sooner or later seems to be stifled of his creativity by simply hanging out with the dull Amory.Another point I have to make is that his one little affair with this country girl is so vague and unclearly written, the only things I understood about it was her poem and a horseback ride.Honestly, it was good in the beginning, but soon enough, it slowly fell apart. By the end it was just a chaos of words. By the end, when he climbs into a car with a big man with goggles and begins a string of vignettes about his views on society which all go nowhere, the book is just analyzations.Well anyway, it just had a horrible impact on my life and I hated his little encounter with the man with curly feet."
4,Good Tea!,Great tea for the price and for a non loose leaf. Wish the bags had a string so it would be easier.
1,disappointed,"After reading the fantastic reviews of this tea, I thought I just had to have it! This does not taste like any Irish Breakfast tea that I've ever had and is actually quite bland. I am very disappointed after reading the reviews to discover this is quite tasteless. At this point, I prefer Fresh & Easy's Irish Breakfast to this and before that I will drink Twinings or ESP Emporiums loose. Also, all the other teas I listed are priced more reasonably than this tea. Don't waste your money like I did."
4,Good value for money,"I have recently purchased both the 5001 and the 6000 series REX, and found the 5001 to be more flexible in its synching options, and less delicate.I use my REX primarily as an address book, to do list and notes. Input is not a big issue for me, nor is Web content downloads.The 5001 uses the Starfish TrueSync technology to synch with any number of devices, including cell phones, Yahoo and Palm Desktop. I actually synch mine with both Palm Desktop and Yahoo simultaneously so that I have access to my addresses over the Internet.The 6000 does not support TrueSync, limiting my synchronization options to be only Outlook, and the bundled desktop application. The 6000 also seems to be more delicate with both the screen and the buttons.Bottom line: I just returned my 6000 and am ordering a second 5001."
2,Another one bites the dust!,"The rex system is small, flexible and can be an indispensable resource when away from home or office. Unfortunately I've just had to purchase my third replacement. They don't stand up well to everyday use. The first started eating batteries, one set every 5 minutes as long as you were willing to feed it. The second suffered a broken screen the first day of use. I have high hopes for the third.A replacement Rex come with the full set of accessories and costs accordingly. Amazon.com makes it more affordable. I'd have given up on it if I had to pay recommended retail."
3,DENTIST 2,"Eh. Dentist 2 takes our man-falling-off-the-edge dentist who goes on an uncontrollable murder spree to stop the spread of decay, filth, and imperfection in a world he can't control and puts him on the run and hiding out in a small town. He's trying to resist the urges that compelled him to violence in the past, but ends up having quite a hard time doing it. As the movie moves along, his self-control quickly degrades, as does the power of his character. What originally was a very frightening, very human (albeit very deranged human) character becomes a typical, cookie cutter horror movie villain by the final scene. It's disappointing that the psychological horror of the original got reduced to what boils down to your cliche'd horror film antagonist. I realised early on the psychological element of the first one was going to be absent, but was truly saddened that the character was going to be reduced to an easily-written monster. Eh!"
4,"Stylish, complex, but easy to use","The watch is unique, which is outstanding in a digital world. Typical Casio craftmanship. Many complex timing features, but easy to master. $$$ value second to none. Only negative: dark blue hour hand is difficult to see in dull light."
5,"Yes, it was indeed round",It's an O-Ring. It was round. It worked. (Why am I writing a review on this....)
2,Not the products fault,I simply misunderstood what this product meant by 0-ring. However even given this slight mistake along with a little lubricant this doubles as a great 0-ring stabilizer.
5,Exactly what I needed. Great price!,"I use these in making paint thickness gauges. The price is great, quality is very good; does exactly what it should! I will be buying these again!"
4,A great guide to Final Cut Pro,"I think that J. Ewing, who wrote the negative review, is on crack (metaphorically J.Ewing, not literally, chill - don't try to sue me for slander. Geez, you need to relax J. Ewing, you need to relax). This book is a definitive guide to Final Cut Pro 4 just as all of Lisa Brenneis' previous version have been for previous versions of FCP. Check out the rest of the amazing reviews for this book. Then, if you too are on crack, listen to J. Ewing. If not, buy this readable, helpful, insightful, and concise guide to FCP 4."
1,Anything you buy in a group or pack is mainly junk,Half of this pack wasn't worth using. Kind of bummed but you get what you paid for! I wouldn't waste your money on it.
3,"cheap stuff, but can't be beat for the price","would buy it again nothing has broke since christmas, just seems cheaply made. but look at the price so what so what so u expect"
1,Not a Soccer Ball!,"Beware: if you're ordering this product for a soccer (proper football) lover, you may not get a soccer ball. I received a red and white pseudo-basketball. The tag said ""soccer ball"" too so the manufacturer is clearly not an athlete/sportsman.At $4, I didn't bother returning it, but be forewarned: you may not receive a soccer ball!"
1,Asphalt? What's the deal?,"Multi page story on asphalt? WHO THE F@#K CARES!!!Skimpy and unfocused editorially. The only thing they're consistent about is the use of short punchy blurbs in different fonts and sizes. For example, they had Mari Holden on the cover of a recent issue promising pro secrets. What was her secret? My parents told me to use a helmet... And similar advice from other pros.Read CyclePlus magazine from the UK for an in depth, systematic approach to product review, ride routes(almost all in the UK) and a variety of short relevant articles that inform without dumbing down the issue. (OK. The two pages on yoga every month is a bit too much but they can get away with that becaause the magazine is so much fatter that Bicycling.)"
2,good for beginners,"This is an OK magazine for beginner cyclists. Experienced or competitive cyclists will probably find the articles to be very shallow, repetitive, or obsolete. CyclingPlus is a much better magazine, but also much more expensive."
2,Bicycling magazine,Signed up for a 1 year subscription. I was quite disappointed to receive two magazines for my first month. One was the current month publication and the second was the previous months publication. I feel cheated already. Not a favorable first impression.
4,Mountain BikeMag,"I usually thumb through Bicycling mag., but i read the MTB supplimental from front to back."
3,Very Technical,While this is an excellent magazine it is very technical in nature. Anything you would want to know gear wise is here. I would like to see more training tips but over all I am very satisfied.
5,Not just for roadies btw...,"You won't find this magazine cheaper anywhere else. Years ago I used to only ride mountain bikes and everytime I looked in this magazine it seemed to have road exclusive content. Well times changed and my riding migrated to the road so I thought I'd check out Bicycling mag for input. Now I find that they not only have a much broader scope of cycling coverage that includes mountain, commute, sub-cultural riding styles, pro race updates and the like but the other content and the lay outs are wayyy improved too. Using this deal it's cheap to check it out again. Then come back to Amazon and sign up for an additional year or two to make sure you get the same deal for awhile."
3,Too big and bad finish,"I bought this case for my Jornada 540 and I found that the case is extremly big. Even there is a place to hold 2 extra battery these are useless for my Jornada, but they can be used for a pen.Anyway the case protect my pocket PC and that's the major issue of this product."
1,Not good quality - leaked air upon arrival,"This is a great idea and would be a good product if it held air pressure and didn't leak. Unfortunately, it leaked as soon as I installed it and would have drained the spare tire in short order. Leakage was from the cap end (the end farthest from the valve stem). Can't recommend."
2,OK but probably wouldn't buy this again,"Ok product, with two major shortfalls relative to the GTS style:1) you have to drill holes in the underside front lip of the hood to mount it which start a corrosion path for your hood to rust out2) the directions SUCK... they call out the wrong size drill bit- good thing I was paying attention"
3,Nice book but misses the Tax point,"Any type of sales tax or ""progresive"" tax is unjustified and inherently bad. A national sales tax would surely lead us into a depression. Are we, as a society, to tax the really poor, disabled, aged (on a fixed income). I think not. are we to give them a card to display that says- I'm poor, don't tax me, then the next year they finally ""make it"" and pay no taxes, I think not. only a flat tax with NO deductions will work. Its that simple- FLAT."
3,A fervent call for tax reform.,"Amity Shlaes makes a strong argument for fewer and lower taxes at the federal, state and local levels. Obviously, everybody is in favor of tax reform. The problem is to find an optimum solution that would satisfy all of us. Unfortunately, the book loses some of its credibility when the author suggests ""privatizing"" social security. Why not a simple progressive tax: the higher the income, the higher the tax."
2,"Nice overview and history, not much on innovative thinking.","This is an easy to read and interesting history of our current tax mess, but a few more concrete examples and some suggestions on the way out would have been nice. How about a vol. 2 with some intelligent thinking directed at a new tax system."
3,be crareful before buying,"this is a great prank to pull, but it brakes very easily. my friend steped on the fake 5$ bill and it broke. and you have to find a good way to conseel the tape because it doesn't come with anything to attacht it to the object"
2,No delivery,I ordered this and was told I would receive the Feb issue. I have not yet and it is the middle of the month. I received another magazine ordered the same day at the beginning of Feb
2,TERRIBLE customer service,"Self is okay. I chose not to renew because of the customer service. They would send me multiple issues, one to my permanent address and one to my campus address, even though I put in an address change 5 times. I also contacted the company at least 5 times and received no response. The magazine itself was the same thing over and over and it focused too much on beauty, sex, makeup, etc."
2,Discouraging and Sinful with a few good recipes,"I subscribed to Self because I wanted encouraging tips on health and fitness. Over two years of subscribing, I'm convinced that this magazine is encouraging... just not in a healthy way. This magazine promotes having internet flings, three-way sexual relations, and (this is the one article that really irritated me) how one woman discovered her happiness by having an affair. Now, I'm not saying this sort of thing doesn't happen in the world, but I sure do not support it and do not want to spend my hard earned money to read about women who need psychological help or a better moral compass. Does media follow society or does society fuel the media? I think it's definitely both... but I know a good way to rectify it. Stop producing garbage articles and telling youth and women in their 20s-30s that they can discover their sexual ""health"" by having multiple partners, affairs, and internet sex. I'm incredibly disappointed with this magazine."
3,Love the cookie cutters but never use the recipes,The cookie cutters are smaller than many in dog recipe kits so I use them alot. And they are cute. The recipes though are too complex and call for many things that I rarely or never have on hand. So I stick with other recipes but still use the cookie cutters.
1,Not thrilled with this book!!,"I purchased this book because I have become comfortable with ""Training From The Source"" series. I feel the author/author's could have done a much better job explaining why and how rather then writing we don't have enough room for that.... I was left with way to many questions when I finished the book and had to buy Cold Fusion MX Web Application Construction Kit (Fifth Edition) to help me. If you are having problems with code not working from the authors directions, check the finished code. Unfortunately you will have to do this more then once."
3,Very Nice,"there re 11 tracks on this CD.I think there are only 5 good songs on the record,but the 5 good songs are SO good they make buying this CD worth the price.""the present tense"" is a good song a nice groove and a good chorus.""Window to the World"" is another good one..A little harder and heaver than the rest of the CD.""Working at Perfect"" is worth a listen as is ""moving to Bohemia"".The best song by far is the last song on the record ""Grace to Grace"".In my oppinion it is one of the best song Geddy has ever released with or without RUSH.Pick this CD up...you wont regret it ."
4,Really solid solo effort,"It's good. It's not Rush, but it's still one of the better releases of 2000. Highlights for me include tracks one, two, and a couple near the end. Geddy really shines through most of these tracks, playing truly tasty chords and riffs. His chordal playing keeps growing, which makes me happy. When you listen to the disk, listen really closely from 1:50-ish to 2:15-ish on track two. Ben Mink is doing some guitar stuff that makes me think IMMEDIATELY of Pete Fergus (the guitarist from Moneypenny), a really atmospheric wash floating around the background of the song. That part of the song really made me stop what I was doing and listen closely. Geddy's voice is quite solid throughout. Matt Cameron's drumming is exactly what these songs are calling for, rock rock solid with occasional flourishes into the flamboyant."
4,"Geddy is great, but.......","My Favourite Headache (MFH) is an excellent CD by any standards. It's a must for any RUSH fan, and undoubtedly a necessary item for all those who are anxiously awaiting a new studio release from the Canadian Power Trio (MFH is like an appetizer of sorts). The CD's best song is the title track, which could easily have found its way on RUSH's last studio CD Test For Echo. The music on MFH is nothing short of genius, but I must admit, without Neil Peart's brilliant lyrics, something seems a little off balanced. It's easy to recognize that Neil is not on the drums and Alex is not pounding out guitar melodies. This CD is a must for any RUSH fan, but might be a gamble to those not acquainted to the shrill voice (which has deepened through the years) of Geddy Lee. But, hey, take a chance with the guy... I did eleven years ago and it's like hearing a great story from an old friend."
4,Half Decent,"This is an allright cd. It is not as good as I hoped it would be. It was just alittle soft for my taste. The song ""My Favorite Headache"" was probably one of the best on the cd. The next song ""living in the present tense"" sounds pretty cool at first, but the verse is pretty bad. The song ""window to the world"" Is an allright song. The next one ""Working at Perfekt"" is in my opinion the best one on the cd. The rest of the cd is allright. It does not have anything really memorable, but it is a good cd to put in and calm yourself down."
4,A Reminder of the Golden Age of Stax/Volt,"Ricky Fanté sure knows how to strike the pose, how to fraze it, how to make it sound like it did back when Volt/Stax was the hottest sound around, but he lacks the depth, it's like he forgot to share himself, it's almost to perfect, just the emotional depth missing, it's close but no cigar.It should have been 3,5 stars, but still if anyone finds the way back to the originals, I'd gladly give it 4 stars.We can just hope and pray that Ricky gets swept away on the next album, he sure knows how to carry a tune...But unlike Otis and C;o it's not for real, it's a pose, a well executed one, but still just a pose..."
2,Caution: Read with care...,"Like most markets and investing books you would do well to take them with a grain of salt. That is the case with this book.I appreciate the subject matter and the book came highly recommended to me.As a Chartered Financial Analyst with almost 20 years experience I am having a difficult time finishing this book. The author makes factual assertions without any empirical backup. For instance, he asserts that fundamentally greater wealth does not make a person happier. This is not factual.There is a great deal of current research into happiness and wealth, greater wealth suffers from diminishing returns, but suffice to say that people with double the average income are in aggregate happier than the average American.If this was the only example I would hold my tongue, but it is not.Caution: Read with a grain of salt."
2,My Review,At times it was hard to follow due to the old English in the wording. The words most likely proper for when Shirley was written. I would recommend the book to older readers 60 +!
3,"The Fellowship of the Ring, Lord of the Rings",I was a bit disappointed in the appearance of the cover but over all the paper back was good.The item was received quicker than expected.
3,"Great book, wrong cover","The book is the one ordered, however the copy sent did not match the printed cover shown which I was specifically looking for."
4,Slow to get going but still great,Yes I know the book is a little slow to get its feet wet but after a hundrened pages or so it is exelent. For a good while is it mindless travleling but I must say that it is still a great book and the series only gets better. Hang in there for the first part because it is worth it in the end.
4,"GReat book, bad price",The story itself is so much better than what the movie provides. Definitely worth the read! just wish i has bought the trilogy for 15 dollars rather than this one for 8 and i know the other two will cost 8 as well
3,Very plodding and too frequently boring,"FOTR is really wordy and much too long. Could have been half as long and twice as good if Tolkien had removed all of the really unecessary description, histories, songs (esp. the songs, really pointless), etc. I found it very difficult to stay with this book. After reading the Hobbit, this book is just too slow."
5,The best fantasy novel ever.,"I'm really tired of the Fellowship getting a bad rap, even by Tolkien enthusiasts. ""Too slow and not enough action"", I've heard, ""the weakest book in the trilogy"". Huh? What about the pursuit of the hobbits by the Nazgul, the Flight to the Ford, the tentacled monster at the gates to Moria and the battle at the bridge with an army of orcs and the Balrog? That's NOT action?!? And the so-called ""slow parts"" happen to be the most magical moments in the history of English literature. The pastoral beauty of Hobbiton, the House of Tom Bombadil, Lothlorien...people are actually COMPLAINING about these!?!? Being an English major, I've read a lot of so-called 'classics' and nothing, save Shakespeare has ever come close to Tolkien's powers of imagination."
3,Hmmmm....,"This book is about the journey of Frodo Baggins and his friends, Pippin, Merry, Sam (all hobbits as is frodo),Legolas (an elf), Gimli (a dwarf), Aragorn and Boromir (men), and the wizard Gandalf. I did not find this book particularly intruiging, though I am glad I read it because I will hear references to it throughout my life, I'm sure. In short there was to much talking and sitting around a campfire, eating lavish meals in lavish halls and whatnot. I would still reccomend it because, if you think about the plot and everything involved it is and excellent insight on life. About the power of friends and how the misuse of power may lead to corrupt."
4,Fantastic Page-Turner with the most minor of flaws,"Well, I must say, I have been reading several of these reviews and they seem pretty much the same: there are two ways to go: its boring or its incredible. For those who think that one must slug through this book do not have a very imagintative mind and won't allow themselves to explore the wonderful descriptions of nature and surprizing realistic chracteristics of the protagonoists. I do agree that the very beginning of the book is a bit trivial, but it sets up the rest of the story incredibly well. Of course, the other way is the ultimate 5 star way, which i would give to the other two books. the second half of this book is absolutely stunning while the later part of the first half gets really intersting as well. The only reason this book does not get 5 star is the slight slow start. Otherwise, if you cannot make it through that much are not a real fantasy fan, just a simple-minded moron."
4,1/3,"I actually like the whole series, but I figured that I would rate them individually. I would give ""Fellowship"" 4 1/2 stars, because I really like it (as opposed to just liking it, which would be 4 stars). Unfortunately, having watched the movie, the movie is fresher in my mind. I do remember liking the book more than the movie, and I like the movie a lot, so....there you have it."
4,Great,Definitely a book to read if you are an advanced reader and likes fantasy. I still like the movie better though.
4,Good But Somewhat Boring,"This was a great book overall, and I think J.R.R. Tolkien is definitely a genius. Since I haven't read the entire trilogy, I can't judge the three as a whole. There are some chapters that you can't stop reading, and there are some that you just can't wait to be over. It takes perseverance to finish, but well worth it in the end."
2,"Nice plot, nice worldbuilding, lousy book.","Now, I will start by saying that J.R.R. Tolkien is incredible, and Middle Earth is truly a masterpiece. However, he may have been better off just building the world and letting someone else ghost-write the actual books.The problem is that there isn't a single aspect of Middle Earth that he *doesn't* mention in this book. Since there's no way to just sort of work the details in, there are large amounts of *explaining* by the narrator. Consequently, the book looks more like a documentary than a novel. Tolkien would have been better off leaving out details, if there was no good way to include them without having to actually spend a full chapter describing the Shire.So, if you can put up with the *extraordinarily* slow pace, you may enjoy this book. I would say, though, that this is one of those extremely rare cases where the movie is better."
3,"Yes, I know that it is a classic masterpiece..","This book is a great book but you have to be ready for the difficulties of reading it. It is hard to get into the language and fully understanding it. Sometimes you will have to read the same sentence over and over to finally get the meaning. I love the characters and as the book goes on it is easier to read. I can almost put myself in middle earth and feel like I am there with Frodo and everyone else. Just don't over analyse the language and try to remember everything that goes on, that would make reading this book like a headache. Your best bet is just to read and enjoy and go along with the characters and try to image what the places look like, etc... this is how I enjoyed the book."
1,About a messed up hobbit trying to save his butt.,I hated this book. It was a waste of my money. And also a waste of my little time left here on earth because I will soon be gone into the unknown world.
3,The Bevil Review,"This book is pretty good. Although, it gets boring throughout the book, it turns out to be pretty good."
5,"""The Fellowship of the Ring"" receives 5 Stars!","I was encouraged to read the book after I had seen the preview of the movie on tv a million times. Reading the first page of the book got me hooked completely! Lord of the rings is much 'better' than 'Harry Potter' J.K. Rowling better watch out! Even though Mr. Tolkien is dead, he is, to me,Mr. Tolkein is the greatest author of Fantasy/Sci-fiction novels of all time! My father has read the movie and he loved it! I am reading Two Towers now and I have already seen the movie! The movie was a job well-done and I can't wait to see Two Towers in theaters this December. Mr. Tolkein's son, Christopher Tolkein also I must applaud him on the most wonderful book ever, Silmarillion! I can't wait to read It! I own the trilogy myself and I tell you, Tolkein's work is truely a treasure to keep!"
5,Tolkien just keeps getting better,"I read The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings five years ago, and then again earlier this year. They are wonderful. The Lord of the Rings, however, is much darker than The Hobbit. In The Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins found a powerful ring. Now, his nephew Frodo is on a mission to destroy it, before it can be used to overpower all that is good in Middle-Earth. The characters are complex and believable, the land itself is the most detailed fantasy world ever created; it has a very vivid history. Some scenes in the first half are corny (like the Tom Bombadil scenes), but the rest of it is exactly as it should be. If you haven't read it, you don't know what you're missing."
3,Not my style.,"I do not like mythical books, so I knew I was in for it when I started ""The Fellowship of the Ring."" I became interested in the story 100 pages before it ended (I became very bored during the traveling). The names are a lot of fun, though! Just to say them aloud is a fun challenge! If you love Tolkein and mythical stuff, then this is the book for you; if not, don't even read this if you are dared."
5,YOU HAVE NEVER READ UNTIL YOU READ THIS,This story is unprecedented and will never be topped by any other author for scope. You can get lost in this book and live another life in it.
4,Overall good job,"This is the only way you can get the unabridged version in audio format right now. That in itself makes this a worthwhile purchase. Rob Inglis is a good, but not great reader. He has a rich voice, but doesn't have the expressiveness and vocal changes by character you find with the reader on the Harry Potter audio formats. Truthfully his reading makes it difficult to pay attention some times. You may find yourself wandering off mentally. He does do an excellent Gollum, though. It's nice soothing listening while you are driving in your car."
3,This book is tedious,I saw the movie first and was in awe of it. The story on the screen is captivating and the special affects were astounding. The book though was tedious. It was just a boring discription of history and observations about the nature in the journey. I could hardly connect with any of the characters on an emotional level and I really coundn't get into the story and missed some of the important plot point because i just wanted to finish it. I do like the story and plot so that is why my rating is this high.
1,Huge misprint,This Houghton-Mifflin hardcover edition has an inexcusable misprint--buyer beware. Follwoing page 184 is a 50 or so page block from the second book in the series. Roughly 50 pages are *missing* from The Fellowship of the Ring which do not appear in any of the three books.
1,plastic junk,"This don't work plain and simple not sure whats up with all the good reviews here, but I bough some glucosamine from wallmart work better than this. If you want to waste your money go right ahead I wont."
4,good stuff,good stuff I really like this product. Give it a try and you want be disappointed. Great quality is a plus
4,Table is fine but ...,"Table is fine, but it came with a dent in the top. I turned it so the dent does not affect my work surface.But, after it was shipped to my school, my principal told me it was cheaper at Costco, and no shipping charge."
4,600 pages of information crammed into 466 pages.,"This book is densely packed with detail. Almost every inch of every page is filled with text and screenshots. This makes it very difficult to read. Many of the screenshots are so small, you'll need a magnifying glass to see the details.That being said, there is a lot of good information in here. And almost every image is beautiful, full color. The CD contains all the files you'll need to follow along with the examples in the book plus a bunch of useful actions, filters, etc.This is a book for intermediate or advanced Photoshop users. Beginners will be overwhelmed."
4,Still good after all these years.,"I used to run during the ""first running boom"" of the 1970's and early 80's, but had taken a break of over 20 years. I used to read Runner's World back then. I started running again early this year, and have now started reading Runner's World again. I read perhaps 80-85% of it each month, and that's not bad. Most of the articles are quite good, and include inspiration and good information about improving running and overall health."
5,A great magazine,This is a very good magazine.I have run 26 marathons and many other races and I find with each issue that there is an article that gives some good advice or just gives me the incentive to get out there for that long cold Sunday morning run. A good read for any runner or for someone looking to get into the sport.
2,Ain't What It Used to Be,"I've been running since I started college in 1972, so perhaps I am a bit of an old ""you know what."" However, in recent years, the magazine has become more of a fluff piece with less substance than it used to have. Perhaps I am nostalgic for the Sheehan columns, or maybe I just don't appreciate all of the ""fashion"" articles.I could use a little less of the cluttered graphics, and a bit of a return to the clean sparkling style of old.Of course, I realize that at 45 years of age, I am NOT in the ""target demographics"" however, I would appreciate a bit more for the older runner (not just the occasional ""token"" article)."
4,Great magazine,Picked up this magazine subscription for my wife who has become pretty passionate about running. She really enjoys the magazine - gives great tips and has excellent articles which she truly enjoys. One of her favorite running magazines.
4,No More Marathons,"Scolastic Coach provides excelent articles from a coaches perspective and helps you train yourself like your coach would train you. Unfortunately, the Runner's World magazine has far too many marathon articles and fillers."
4,hasn't come in the mail yet,"I ordered the magazine over a month ago, and haven't gotten the first issue yet. I rated it 4 starts b/c I like the magazine, just would be nice to actually have one to read!"
3,No log with this subscription,Excellent magazine for my Runner! But this subscription did not contain the Runners Log that others offer at the same price.It was a renewal and I'm not happy with my choice.
3,Moderately enjoyable fluff,"Why is it that every issue of Runners World seems to have some hot babe on the cover, at least 1 article on how to drop five pounds, and another article along the lines of ""energize your workouts?"" I have a current subscription which I got free with some airline miles, but I'm not sure I'd spend my own money to subscribe. I do enjoy the feature stories they'll do from time to time on prominent distance runners."
3,Casio pathfinder,"Received and quickly returned this watch. It worked well and has a great list of functions, although the compass is very skittish. I was suspicious that the watch would be too much plastic and buttons but decided to give it a shot anyway. Well, too much plastic and buttons."
3,OK,It is not a bad watch packed with features but for the money I expected something a bit more durable.
1,"So abridged, there's nothing left!","I started reading this book and fell in love. Then, I bought the audio version so that I could finish it in the car. The two don't even compare! This book is so abridged, it ends up sounding like, ""Then she met so and so, then they went here, then they got married, etc."" I mean, all of the beauty of the descriptions and character development and nuances are gone. It's good for reviewing for a test, maybe, but you're probably better off with Cliff Notes. Just buy the book!"
5,soothing piano,If you like the soothing sound of piano then this is for you. So relaxing to your mind. Great music selections!
4,Very good short book that goes beyond theories and equations,"What a surprise that the first thirty something pages (yes, 30+) were devoted to the history of late 19th centuries, with another twenty something telling other scientific stuff that had built the foundation for Einstein's theories. The animation is brilliant. The elaboration is easily understandable even for high school students. Though it's written nearly two decades ago, it really can stand the test of time. Recommended!"
4,never received $30.00 coupon,"ordered pampers for grandson , yes they arrived in 2 business days but the only reason I ordered this product was to assist my daughter,offer stated I would receive a $30.00 coupon which I have'nt receive as of yet. order placed 1st week of March . False advertizement"
3,It is not the same!!!,"It is not the same product, we buy at walwamrt ot other superstore...there is difference in the quality...."
2,Not worth for the price,Product is good and acceptable. However for the price of the produce it's not work it.Material used is not suitable for Kids of this age.
1,From best to WORST!,"Pampers has taken the best, highest quality diaper on the market & made it one of the worst, cheapest diapers on the market. There are many downgrades to the Cruisers that have me very angry:1) They seem to be made of construction paper-they are VERY stiff, cheap & papery (the old cruisers used to be very soft)2) No more mesh liner to wick away moisture! This has proven to cause many diaper rash on many babies (this is from feedback from other parents I know)3) 5 inches of paper in the back of the diaper: no padding, no absorbency-do they really test these things before sending this stuff out? What's going to absorb all the #1's & #2's back there? Paper???4) Absolutley no notice had been given of this deceptive switch. All boxes/packaging is the same as the old cruisersI could go on with other things, but I have things that need to get done-like shop for a new brand of diapers. It's a shame, I really loved Pampers, but this is a disgrace!"
5,Excellent product,"Snugger fitting than Target brand, Seventh Generation, and Huggies. Not one accident. Thick and absorbant. No chafing. Great elastic waistband and tabs stick firmly. Faint, but pleasant, scent. No complaints at all from our little girl. Yes, it costs a bit more, but absolutely well worth it."
1,Don't buy these!!,"I tried these diapers for the first time a week and a half ago, and now my son has the most severe rash that I've ever seen. He never had any problems with the normal pampers but as soon as I switched hie broke out. I've been putting cream on him, and that doesn't even help. Luckily he is going to the doctors tomorrow. I wouldn't have even know the cause, had there not been a news story today about this brand causing rashes in lots of babies. I will no longer be using Pampers brand diapers."
1,Change for the worse,"I have used Pampers on my baby since she was a newborn. I don't know why Pampers changed the cruisers. It used to be soft, have a great cover lining and be very absorbent.Now they are very papery, they took out the lining and it takes minutes for the diaper to absorb the pee. Also, the absorbent material goes only half way up the diaper.So disappointed! Just bought a 180 ct box..."
3,Okay...,Pampers is a good brand but they tend to leak. Huggies seems to be the best brand out of all diapers.
5,Best diaper - good price - timely service,"Subscribe & save service for diapers works out well. I recommend it to parents who don't like the 'firedrill' experience of running out, last minute to replenish."
3,Make it (s)nappy,"Hi there,Amazon is not only a book company....it sells everything from jewellery to computers, grocery and watever you can imagine in the past 8 to 10 years...there's nothing snappy about it...."
1,To the Moon and Back,"Enough single-use garbage diapers are used in the U.S. each year to reach to the moon and back. Think about where they come from and where they go. What kind of world do you want your kids to live in?Cloth diapers are not difficult, and regardless of the propoganda of the garbage diaper companies, they have no where near the negative environmental impact."
4,Best diapers we used,"Nothing is perfect... but we tried all of the major makes of diapers on the market, and the Pampers are better then the rest.Both construction & capacity were above others. BTW, we also tried the ""Baby Dry"" variety, and they are not as good, but can be used for sleep time."
5,comfortable for my baby and convenient delivery for me!,"I am completely happy with the diaper. It fits well, seems comfortable and stretchy for my baby. Have not experienced any diaper leaks. Absorbs well, keeps my baby dry. I love having them delivered to my house!"
3,"Love the diapers, but why the price hike??","I've been buying my Pampers Cruisers from Amazon for quite some time. I love them and after having tried virtually every other brand/non-brand available, I never looked back once I found Cruisers. But what the heck? It's been a couple months since I've purchased here b/c I stocked up last time, but I'm floored to see that they are $7 more than just a few months ago! I love buying from Amazon but I'll be checking out Sams to see if I can get them cheaper. Previously Amazon was still the cheapest but I'm doubting that now. Bummer."
3,Not as good as old design,"The newly designed Pampers cruisers is not good as original design at all. The newly designed diapers are thin and cost much less than before. Disappointing... BTW, the Amazon description and picture of the diaper does not match the newly designed. There was no absorb-away liner anymore which was the feature I liked a lot. Amazon needs to update the product description."
1,I will stay with the Huggies,"I didn't find that these are worth the extra money that you pay. After wearing these for 2 days, my daughter developed a pretty nasty diaper rash. After about a week and a half of not clearing up, I decided to put her back in some Huggies. Her rash cleared up within 2 more days. That is not why I am giving them such low marks though. EVERY morning, my daughter would be drenched from the Cruisers leaking! We didn't and still don't have that problem with the Huggies. I will save myself grief and money and stick with the good old Huggies."
5,Can't live without Pampers!,Pampers are the best brand available! They are the only brand I've found that doesn't leak. I won't us anything else.
5,Our favorite,"I think we have become somewhat spolied when it comes to diapers. We have used Pampers from the beginning (over a year ago now)and we love them! We've gone from the Swaddlers to the Baby Dry and now we're onto the Cruisers. They are soft, very absorbent and easy to use. I had to buy generic diapers at our local grocery store because I ran out of Pampers and I was very disappointed with them. Also, by getting Pampers through the Subscribe and Save program we save money (over buying them at the store)and the diapers are delivered right to us. Although not cheaper than the generic brands, it is worth it for us and for our little girl."
2,Old Diapers- same Price,"I have always ordered diapers from Amazon...The past 2 times, the diapers have been old and sticking together (apparently from heat)....Upset at the lack of quality these days!"
5,Very satisfied,We've tried both Pampers and Huggies for our 7-month old son. We like Pampers Cruisers more. It's softer and absorbs well. We don't need to worry about night-time leaking. Would strongly recommend it.
1,Not the same cruisers,"BUYERS BEWARE!!!! Do not pay attention to all the positive ratings prior to December 2009. The product is not the same.I have been a pamper customer since the day my baby was born. The old swaddlers and cruisers were great, with the mesh lining. However, pampers switched the product without changing the packaging, duping its customers to pay the same premium $$ for an inferior product. The new cruisers are horrible and prone to leaking as the new lining doesn't hold the same amount of pee overnight. Gone is the mesh lining that used to wick away the moisture from baby's skin. Seems like these new cruisers are the old Pampers Baby Dry.I guess now I will have to search for another brand, since I am so disappointed with Pampers."
2,Quality has gone down like anything!!,"Let me begin by telling you all I have always loved the pampers brand diapers. Since my son was born, i used swaddles and then went onto cruisers. He is 20 months old and I have never had any problems. This last box i ordered has the worst quality of diapers. I think they are just packaging their ""newer"" version in these. These are so thin and i have had leaks since the day my son is using them. I am soooo disappointed.I was just hoping its my box and they are not using this tactic on every box but several of my friends told me about the same issue.I dont mind paying a few cents per diaper more for good quality but this is just ridiculous. I then went out and bought huggies movers and I think once this box finishes, I am just going to convert to huggies."
1,Why the 35% price hike?,"We started ordering pampers from Amazon a few months ago, when Pampers were $7.49 a pack. Why all the sudden the $3.00 price increase? That is a huge and unfair rate increase, and makes ordering online no longer a savings. I can get a better price at Meijer ($9.49), and that's BEFORE I use coupons. It's disappointing that this product will no longer be offered at a good price. No incentive to come to Amazon and shop anymore. What a shame. Hopefully enough people who express concern can help make a change. I'll be glad to come back to Amazon when the great price comes back."
1,Amazon INCREASED prices way too much!,"Like the other reviewers, I have bought diapers from Amazon for months. Now, I will be going to local grocery and discount tore for them instead. A $3 price increase in less than a month is CRAZY to say the least. I hope that everyone shows Amazon and doesn't buy these diapers from them at such a crazy inflated price!"
1,DO NOT BUY THESE DIAPERS in the Economy Pack,"Normally the diapers are great. However, over the past year and from multiple stores - including 4 boxes we just bought on Amazon - we have had issues with the Economy Pack (or whatever it's called). At least half, if not more, of the diapers are defective and my children wake up in the morning with the little absorbing beads all loose, the diaper split open, and a big giant mess. Not to mention a real pain to clean up. We still use these Cruisers, but we buy them in the smaller packs, not this Economy Pack."
1,Price keeps rising,"Initially I was excited to find the ""jumbo"" box of pampers available online - I live in Manhattan and can't easily make it to a Costco/Sam's/BJs/Price Club. However, the price on this item isn't as good of a deal as when they first started offering it. In fact, I get a bettter price ""per diaper"" using our local online grocer. Do the math before you buy!"
5,Good product+good shopping experience,Pampers diapers are very good. Both my son and daughter use this product and we love them. Good absorbance. We never had diaper rash problem. The diapers are high in the waist line and therefore don't cause leakings especially for boys. And cruisers are good for active toddlers. I always buy from Amazon no matter it's a couple of dollars more or less than in the store--it's delivered fast to your door (I sometimes order when I only have one day's supply left and the next day I got it). I give it 5 stars for both the product and the experience of shopping with amazon.com.
4,A welcome return,"While it's true that only two or three of the songs in this collection really seem like modern classics, it's still a very enjoyable album overall. In fact, it's one of those rare CD's where I can listen straight through without being tempted to skip a track here and there.For over 30 years, Milsap has been one of country music's purest voices. The real charm of MY LIFE is that he's never sounded better."
1,NOT Digitally remastered!,"I had the original performance on tape so I was really excited to see this ""digitally remastered"" on CD (with bonus tracks to boot). I know the songs very well--which characters sang and at what time. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!On ""It's the Hard-Knock Life"" you can't even hear some of the orphans in the background. The same is true for ""NYC"", ""We'd Like to Thank You Herbert Hoover"" and ""You're Never Fully Dressed Without a Smile"" just to name a few (you can't even hear the men singing, just mumbling).Not the best rendition out there."
3,"Good, but don't bother with the extras","I purchased this for my 5 YO daughter. She loves it. The only complaints we have about the mixing is that the additional commentary (songs?) at the end is painful to listen to and, in my opinion, has no value at all."
1,Binding fell apart on first reading,The book fell apart as I was reading it for the first time. Perhaps book usability could also have been addressed?
5,A thin book with everything you need,"This book is excellent. It's very accessible and easy reading without being superficial. It's not a usability cookbook, it actually makes you understand its principles and gives you critical sense to analyze any website and see what's wrong (or right) with it.I just couldn't find any negative points about the book."
4,Easy to read and immediately useful,"Everyone who has any part in designing a UI should read this book. Krug outlines the essentials regarding design, hierarchy, navigation, and usability testing (perhaps the most important part of the book). The new edition also includes material on accessibility - he sounds preachier here, but for a good cause.The format is attractive and easily digestible, and the book is short enough to be undaunting, with relevant and colorful illustrations.BTW, I've found a serious flaw in the Amazon reviewer rating system. It only counts ""helpful"" votes ... this means that reviews (esp. for controversial books) basically become shouting matches, where people vote ""no"" to reviews with points of view they don't like, and vice-versa - regardless of merit or content of the review. This undermines the ratings of good reviewers who write thorough reviews of emotionally charged items."
4,Good for all web designers,"I've been deigning websites for almost as long as there's been a web to design for. After sixteen years of web design, I stil found several ways to optimize my own website from reading this book. It is well written, very user friendly, and as I mentioned, information good for anyone in the web design world. Well worth the price. It will become a permanent addition to my library."
3,Need update. Need better pictures,"Pictures inside the kindle book are pretty blur, that make it impossible to read some important text. Please put clearer pictures. We don't care the download size the book to be a little bigger.The content also need UPDATE. Taglines have disappeared from many sites. All web pages in the book changed their look dramatically; some even changed owners. We need a updated book for today's new styles."
5,Excellent collection!,"I ordered this collection after discovering Thayer's ""Software Engineering Project Management"" collection. I was not disappointed. This is a ""must have"" for anybody teaching classes in Software Engineering."
5,No problems,I have had to install and remove the device at 3 times and have had no problems with it. Only an extremely diehard fan of your bike or rack would figure out a way to break this thing
2,america in decline,"yes this cd is smoothly produced, but there is nothing here to sink your teeth into. just more mundane sappy songs. after listening to this cd it left me hungry for the old america . what ever happened to the great harmonies and intricate acoustic guitar work? there are some hints here of past glory but not enough to satisfy.America needs to return to its roots with this cd it appears to be withering on the vine."
5,His Best Book,"This story will remind you of the infamous Claus & Sunny Von Bulow case back in the 80's. A real page turner, when it first came out years ago I breezed thru it then passed it on to friends, and if I was fortunate enough to have it returned it was usually falling apart & I replaced it several times. Highly recommended, along with other books by Edward Stewart such as Deadly Rich,Mortal Grace and Jury Duty."
3,Be aware of print,I order this water shirt and it works great but be aware of what print on the shirt you order. I go a different style of print when I go mine. I did not realize it until later.
2,some diamond...little rough.,"in this sad dream we call life, a lucky few will hear ""under your spell"". unfortunately, it won't be discovered like the treasure it is, but instead will be spoiled to those that watched a cheap pop action film...oh...what could have been. such loveliness is waiting....be was only captured on two tracks. the rest meander and what we are left feeling like the poor girl on the album cover..deprived of a certain something that needs not be repeated. heaven sakes, isn't it obvious? desire may return and really reveal the magic within (and have actually done so with a leaked track entitled ""tears from heaven"") but for now they run the risk of vanishing like a fleeting dream. still, what a lovely distraction.i, for one, find the intro absolutely enchanting and i long to see what they could possible do if they aimed for something more cinematic and mysterious. by the time you hit the second track, it's a complete thud towards the momentum."
4,"Good, but a bit wordy at times","I purchased this book to assist me in cardiovascular schooling and found it to be a great book for gaining an understanding of the principles of pacemaker therapy. At times though, the text is a bit wordy and dry. However, I find it very useful for reading up on anything from the indications for both temporary and permament devices to post-implantation evaluation, complications, and interventions. Unfortunately, with the rapidly changing world of pacemaker therapy, this book may soon find itself obsolete. Hope for an updated edition."
4,Tite Redman CD,"What can i say, Redman is tite. i sometimes like to call him big red or reddy , but u may call him whatever u like"
3,The Skits killed it...,"I'm really sick and tired of skits - this album is full of 'em...way too many. They are annoying and extremely disruptive. With the exception of songs like ""let's get dirty,"" ""briks two"" and ""smash sumthin,"" Malpractice is a dull album to listen to."
3,Typical Redman album,"Too many skits as usual. This is his best album to date. But it falls short of a classic. He has raw rhyming ability and wit, but he lacks depth in his rhymes."
5,Westside Returns!,"TQ is the best. This single makes you feel the love of the West Coast. Even if your from the N, S or East, you know you gotta save some love for the \x/est Side. No playa hating, just the best single this year!!"
1,The Brave Cowboy,"I seriously considered not finishing this read. The story line was not really believable, and nearly the entire book was descriptive text, overdone."
1,"Lil"" NON Movers Boating Fun","The toy did not work. It is suppose to move, we put several differnet NEW batteries in and it does not work : ( My nephew was very upset!"
3,Stunning Photography,"The best thing about National Geographic is the photography. I like this magazine because it allows you to travel the world from the comfort of your favorite chair.The articles are a little boring sometimes.(The reviewer was compensated for posting this review. However, the opinion stated in the review is that of the reviewer and the reviewer alone. Further, the reviewer independently selected this product to review and has no affiliation with the product maker/distributor, Amazon or the review requester.)"
5,we like to read,"its a great take along on trips, rather than toting a book. Handing it over to friends or schools. Keeping a few issues whith articles we use as reference ."
1,Have not received magazine,"I still have not received the magazine. I ordered it back in early September,and was hoping to have gotten an issues by now."
1,Do not buy through Amazon but directly,"I bought National Geographics for my elderly father over 3 months ago. To this day no magazines have arrived. Tired of waiting and after a phone call from him, I barred the wait to talked to someone in NG. They told me that going through Amazon takes at least 3 months!!! and that they have shiped my order two day ago and it will take 2 weeks in transport. If I go directly through them it takes 1 months."
4,Not as good as I remember,But still pretty interesting? I love the pictures and most of the stories. But I might not renew when the year is up
2,"Great magazine, stinky policies","I enjoy the magazine. However, theyt started out by dumping old issues to use up my subscription. I received three isues in one day. Yuk :-("
2,3 copies at once,"I received Dec. Jan, & Feb. at the same time. I didn't want back issues asI had bought them at the book store. I was told I would receive my first copyin Feb. so I planned accordingly and had already purchased the Dec. & Jan. copies.Not happy with receiving back copies."
1,What magazine,Hard to rate this subscription cause I Have not received anything yet. No magazine or even a account number so I can view it on my tablet.
2,Great Magazine......Dont Get It From Amazon,"National Geographic is a wonderful magazine that any one can enjoy. However, do not subscribe to it from amazon. Why pay thirty some dollars, when you can get the exact same thing from the National Geographic Website for fifteen dollars. I do recomend that you get this magazine, you will not regret it. Just save your money and don't get it from Amazon.com."
4,coffea for the strong at heart,this coffea is grown for people who like their java black like good wiskey a taste strong with a kick
5,Almond Amaretto,Great Stuff For Grandma who loves Almond Amaretto Coffee. She is very hard to buy gifts for because Granny has a bunch of stuff
5,Fun makes your Family happier,"I have used the ideas in this book when my children were smaller and now that they are teenagers. We have had many hours of fun. I would recomend this book for families with children of different ages..It is a super book full of super ideas. Hay Grandparents, this book is wonderful for you and your grandchildren as well..."
5,"This book is great, you'll enjoy it!","This was the first book I read in this series and I loved it at once. I loved unicorns when I was little and still do, and combined with magic, adventure, romance, and danger this book was a hit for me! I hope they decide to re-publish it so more people can enjoy it!"
1,Not worth the money,There is a reason why you cannot listen to any tracks on Amazon- you wouldn't buy if you could. I read a number of reviews and figured that it was worth a try given that Metallica was mentioned as being similar in some small way. This band is nothing even near Metallica. I have thrown the disk away- don't bother.
5,Fun fun fun! .... and at first I hated it!,"This movie is being slammed by some adults. Regardless of whether their kids liked it or not (MOST KIDS LIKE IT), it didn't meet THEIR childhood Suess expectations so they slam it.We love Dr. Suess as much as the next family but if you can set him aside for an hour or so you'll find this movie is a whole lot of silly fun. It's very brightly colored, has good energetic music, lots of screaming, running, jumping, laughing and nonsense; it's a very ALIVE movie.My disgust and repulsion faded many views ago (sorry Suess). Besides, my kids like it; it's a whole lot of fun for the entire family (except my wife - it's just too silly for her)."
1,The Cat in the Hat,"I was very unimpressed with this movie. It is not a movie fit for kids or adults. It is in poor and crude taste and did not leave me feeling uplifted in any way. I am appalled that this movie was made this way. It would have been more appropriate, if the movie had been made exactly from the Dr. Suess book."
1,this movie was real bad!!!!,i bought this movie in hope that it would be a good one but i was really let down. This was probably one of the worst movies i have ever seen. If you are a cat in th hat fan just rent the movie and dont make the same mistake i did by buying it.
5,Dr Seuss DVDs,Dr Seuss DVDs are always a favorite in our house. We are Dr Seuss fans. His DVDs are brought on long trips.
4,Great movie!,I purchased this movie for my daughter b/c she loves the book. She now loves the movie as well. The only reason I give it 4 out of 5 stars is b/c I would prefer it be full screen rather than widescreen.
1,a disgrace,This was one of the worst dr. Suess movies ever. It made a complete mockery of the Cat in The Hats good name. I wouldn't make my worse enemies watch it.
2,This Cat Should Stay In The Hat!,"The Cat In The Hat is one of the most disappointing movies of the year and one of the worst. Mike Myers should stick to balying British secret agents and leave the Dr. Seuss characters to Jim Carrey or an actor more willing to make a family film. Myers is not funny and comes off as trying way too hard, and even puts in jokes that I thought were too dirty for a movie with Dr. Seuss' name at the top of the title. The production designs are annoying and all the supporting actors come off as annoying, especially Alec Baldwin. Spencer Breslin and Dakota Fanning are good as the children, but they can't save the movie from Myers, usually a very funny actor, just not meant to play this role. Save this one for the litter box!"
1,"Not funny, just weird.","This film was just strange. The colors were visually disturbing. Mike Meyers had a bizarre accent which was a cross between the Cowardly Lion in The Wizard of Oz and Austin Powers. It grated on my nerves.Our six year old did not laugh. We had a chuckle or two. But the plot was thin and went off on tangents. Alec Baldwin was wasted in the role of the evil boyfriend.The Cat's antics were silly and the kids just stared at him woodenly.Someone obviously paid these ""stars"" a truckload of money to make this awful and disjointed and disappointing film."
1,PIECE OF TRASH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Nasty. Awful. Hated it. Although I love the original book, this movie is completely butchering it. The Cat is wild, crude, and lewd. How could they turn a good classic in to this piece of stinking rotten egg. When we saw this, we were expecting good stuff, not this. Do knot buy!!!"
1,Why?,"This is one of those movies that I have walked out of and all I could think was ""Why????""""How could they take a sweet story and corrupt it this way? I have sat many a night with my children, reading this story over and over. They absolutely love Seuss.This movie is visually spectacular, but does not hold true to the spirit of Dr. Seuss. It is not approptiate for young children. It is Austin Powers dressed up like the Cat in the Hat. The need to throw in improper innuendos in a film that should be for children and families is just sad. The rating for this movie should be PG-13. If the studios feel the need to add adult bits to a film, then please don't target my kids!"
3,The humor is bad...,"Yeah, I agree with most people, the humor is bad. It's disgusting for all children to learn, and it will make bad behavior and attitudes with by far one of the most dirty humored jokes. 'Cat In The Hat' is a disapointment to the beloved book by Dr. Seuss. The movie is the same as the book, only with more bad behavior. That's all I had to say.But what the hell is with the kids reveiw that said it was a rip off? Stupid! How is it a rip off? I understand it has bad behavior, but hows it a rip off? And one of the spot light reveiws made a rhyme out of it?! Was that really necessary?Parents, watch this movie before you let your kids watch it [if you want them to watch it]. And I know you kids 10-12 will be laughing like crazy, but it's not a good thing.Note: My three stars were for: 1) All The Special Effects 2)The Setting 3) Thing One and Thing Two [Finally something that doesn't say all those crude humor words]I hope my reveiw was helpful.Sincerly,J.P."
3,No it can`t be 1 or 2 stars!!,"Hey I`ve been giving this 4 and 5 stars all the time, but hey it does deserve 3 stars. It`s not that bad, but it`s not the best. You have to give this movie a chance. Now think about it, it`s not the kind of movie you`d give 1 star, but not the movie you`d give 5 stars to. I used to only give it 4 or 5 stars beacuse the best actress in the world aka Dakota Fanning was in it, but now that I think about it, it`s not the best, but come on it`s not horrible. I have to admit it`s sort of corny, but I have to say it`s funny in a funny way. Well think about it before you write your review to say that this movie stinked. I would recomend this movie to some of you, but some people who don`t give stuff chances don`t even see it beacuse I don`t want the coustomer rating to go down. It`s already bad. Just think about it!"
2,The Book is Better,"I rented this video for a fun little movie that didn't require a lot of attention. Good thing I wasn't paying 100% attention to it, because then I would have felt like I wasted an hour and a half of my day.Even though it's a children's story...the book is still better. Dakota Fanning and Spencer Breslin do a fine job in the movie, but the rest of the cast is not that great at all. Alec Baldwin is disgusting as the evil boyfriend. Mike Myers can't hold a candle to Jim Carrey's version of the Grinch. He uses strange voices that don't work for me. In another review someone said he sounded like the cowardly lion and I agree.It just wasn't funny to me. Colorful and Suessical in some senses, but just not funny."
2,The Cat in the Hat,The movie was not that bad. The low mark is because you can not get past the previews (by the menu or the fast forward options). This is very annoying to my children as well as me. I paid for this movie not the trailers.As for the movie quality - my kids love it. I liked it OK.
1,So lousy my 4 year old nephew chimed in during movie...,"and asked ""Is the movie over yet?"" at the top of his lungs.This piece of garbage ranks up there with Gigli as the worst movie ever."
3,Perfect rainy day movie...,"Yep, the cat in the hat is still good for something. This movie is mildly entertaining. some parts are funny but I only remember laughing a little bit once or twice, mostly I'd classify this film as ""mindless viewing"". You'll probably want to see this only when there's nothing better on and you've already seen you're good dvds at least 3 times already."
3,Daughter had to have this movie,Quality of the picture isn't the greatest but could not find in stores any where so glad to find it at Amazon.
2,CINEMATIC HAIRBALL,"Something tells me Dr. Seuss would not have been happy with this ridiculously crude version of his beloved tale. Aside from its shameless promotion of the studio which produced it and the mention of the movie's pop soundtrack, this film is just too off color to be a kid's film. With several profanity references and some crude bodily humor, one wonders why they felt they had to include such nonsense. Visually, the movie is delightful to behold with its garish colors and some nifty special effects. Dakota Fanning and Spencer Breslin are perfect as the kids, and Alec Baldwin does a nice turn as the nasty slovenly boyfriend. But Mike Myers is just too out of control and self parodying, and Sean Hayes is a real waste as the hygienically concerned boss, but he's delightful in the voice of the fish. I wouldn't want my kids to see it; it's just not in the true spirit of the Seuss books which inspired it."
4,Guns of Navarone has an intriging plot and great characters.,"The book, Guns of Navarone by Alistair MacLean, is a good book with simple descriptions, interesting characters, and an exciting plot which holds you till the end. The characters are easy to relate to. The plot is riddled with crosses and double crosses which the author gives faint clues of throughout the story. The descriptions are brief but good and you imagine yourself there in the middle of the action. All in all, Guns of Navarone is a book I recommend reading."
1,Waaaay overpriced,"When I saw the price of this book I figured I would get a nice hardback with tons of wonderful recipes...instead I received a cheaply printed paperback with no ""wow"" recipes in it. In fact, there are some recipes that call for certain ingredients which aren't even mentioned in the directions! I would suggest getting the other Dominican cookbook which is half the price and offers the same recipes, this one is not worth the money."
2,not as good as bored of the rings,"i bought this book hoping for another bored of the rings. Its ok overall, but it differs from the Hobbit to much. Characters die that should'nt, plot twists occur that should'nt. In places it felt as though the author was trying to re-write the story. instead of concentrating on comedy, like a parody should, it seemed to take itself a bit too seriously."
1,Not wortth the time or effort,"Stay away from this album. The band is in a constant state of flux, the lead singer DJ's on the weekends at some low level bar in Newark. The band members leave on a regular basis. Save your money and download the free music off the net."
1,what order?,"This order was a joke ... I ordered the magazine over a month ago, was charged for it immediately, but haven't received the magazine, a card, nothing!Would I order again? Are you kidding?!?!"
4,INTERESTING MALE TOPICS,"Definitely an interesting magazine for active men, and for those that like to stay up-to-date as what is happening in sports, technology, health, nature, etc. Many of the stories/comments are gender friendly and I catch my wife flipping through the pages. The ads are numerous but well-done - not over-whelming. This past edition had stories about the big BP oil spill, USC football, deadly weapons in the Middle East Wars, and a great story about a vicious, hungry Siberian tiger (no, they're not extinct and are still a major threat to villagers). A good magazine, now in my first year - will probably renew."
2,I used to really enjoy MJ,"Don't get me wrong, occasionally there are issues I still read cover to cover, but it seems as though MJ has gone through a change lately. Gone is the focus of travel and fantastic adventure writing. Now the focus seems to be health, fitness and diet. I used to buy Men's Health magazine for those topics. If I wanted that focus I would continue to buy MH. There is no longer a consistent reason to read MJ on a regular basis anymore. Man, I miss the old MJ!"
2,Rude letters when you do not renew,This unethical company sends you faux debt collection type letters when you opt not to renew your subscription. The content is hit or miss and the retention attempts by their subscription department is just the last nail in the coffin for me with them. I will NOT be subscribing or buying another copy of this magazine. Half of it is ads anyways.
2,Great Magazine If You Make 100K a year!,This magazine misses on the average Joe. It reviews products that the average person can't afford. I picked up a year subscription for a dollar. Can I get my dollar back? The only use this is for me is to recycle it. I mean the interviews are ok. But come on. This is more like Rich Men's Journal.
5,Still the Best Men's Magazine,"I'll have to agree with the other reviewer that Men's Jounal may not be quite as good as it used to be. But it is still the best men's magazine around IMO. Flip through the other men's magazine fodder at the grocery store or your buddy's place, and save your money for a subscription to Men's Journal."
2,3 Past Issues Chewing Up My Subscription!@#$%^&*(!@?!!!,"I thought I was getting a good deal on this fine magazine, but my subscription started with 3 issues arriving. Problem was they were ones from the past! The current issue and the last two months. What about those of us who already purchased them at the newstand and then buy a subscription?To top it off, there is no 1-800 customer service available. I sent an email inquiry at the ""Contact Us"" page, but no reply.Beware, if you buy a subscription, they will send you past issues and be unresponsive to your inquiries."
2,UNCLE WAS A VAMPIRE,"Like Dan O. said...this is a COLOR film because I have an old copy from TV, IN COLOR.Obviously this DVD will be in B&W; (see images), while Horror Express will be in Color.""Horror"" is now on BluRay and ""Uncle"" is on ""iOffer"" in COLOR. The print on this DVD doesn't look that great for ""Uncle""...but then, the ""iOffer""print is barely better."
5,Snippets of Information,"Prevention has a plethora of snippets - nothing that requires setting aside large quantities of time to read, but enough information to help me decide whether I want more information about any given topic. I often notice that guests pick it up to look through as soon as they sit down. A good thing? :)Prevention (1-year)"
5,prevention,very enlightening and informatitive. I read the magazine from begining to end went to the drug store and got me some vitamins as well. Well detailed magazine i enjoyed it very much. Was taken aback by the size thou thought it was the regular size mag but nonethe less i love it.
4,always loved the publication but the new subscription started too early,"I have been subscribing to this magazine for several years. I was under the impression that the new subscription would simply tack on to the existing one; however, I got duplicate copies for two months now. I was quite disappointed that the timing was not as was specified or I would have simply waited until the current subscription expired."
5,Love this magazine,This magazine is very informative and has a good variety of topics.I always look forward to getting it because it gives me lots of ideas about different things. The only thing I wish it had was a crossword puzzle for my husband to work. I would recommend it to anyone.
2,kind of repetitive,"after seeing this magazine at my in-laws, I really wanted to subscribe.after having a subscription to the magazine for two years, I realized that it's essentially the same magazine month after month.all you need to do is read 2-3 of these a year to get the latest and greatest. no need to subscribe."
3,Would probably be great if I was middle-aged,"Amazon offered me a subscription for this for $2. I'm really interested in food, health, etc. so I thought it would be a good read. It's not bad, but I can't relate to half the articles because they're directed at women over 40. I'm 24."
5,I have already renewed my subscription of prevention,I have already renewed my subscription and paid for it with prevention. My subscription is good until 1/1/13. Thank you.
2,Same old news,"While there's a lot of good health tips in Prevention magazine, if you've read a few, you don't need to buy any more issues. I inadvertently had the subscriotion automatically renewed. I don't like automatic renewals. It's a way to suck people in, who aren't attentive to all their e-mails."
2,Delivery issues,"I love Prevention Magazine which is why I ordered a 2-year subscription. I ordered in March. By May had received nothing, wrote a complaint, got a July issue, then got June, August and September at once...an extension of my 2-year order date, and nothing else to date. I am awaiting a response as it has been about 3 months since I received that last set of magazines. Would I recommend this to someone else? NO. Why 2 stars? Because the actual content of the magazine is good but the service is NOT."
4,Enjoyed some articles but too much on weight loss.,"I understand obesity in the US is our main health problem from which stem a lot of other diseases but it did feel for me that it was at some point too much weight loss stuff. There were some very interesting articles, a few of which I have saved, but I would have liked more information about holistic medicine. I wish they included vegetarian recipes in the recipe section because they're great at prevention of health problems.Got the magazine at a promotional rate for one year and decided not to renew it. Cancelling was no hassle at all."
1,DO NOT SUBSCRIBE,"Readers. Be aware of subscribing to Prevention Magazine unless you want to get your credit ruined by North Shore Collection Agency. I have been trying to cancel the magazine continously and they don't acknowlege it at all. Prevention Magazine (Rodale) will decept you into renewing and if you try to cancel over and over, they will send you a letter from Collection Agency saying that you own them money.The choice is yours. There are lots of previous subscribers having the same situation. I thought I was the only one. Check ""Complaints for Prevention Magazine"" on Google.......[...]"
1,Main focus seems to be selling diet books,"This magazine seems most interested in promoting books, etc. that it has a financial interest in--most notably lately the South Beach Diet. Prevention and it's website are now full of misleading banner ads promoting irresponsible dieting techniques and fads. Too bad, because more than ever nowadays we could use a nice little magazine about nutrition, weight loss, exercise and natural remedies that isn't influenced by it's publishing partners and advertisers. Skip this one, and try Self or Health for a more well-rounded look at women's heath needs."
4,"Tons of Ads, and Little Content","This is not my favorite fitness magazine. This is the size of a Reader's Digest, but is packed with ads just like a Beauty Magazine. I find this a bit disappointing considering the breadth of information they tend to cover. They share reasonable and attainable goals, and suggestions for us normal people. The magazine seems to cover a wide age group, with information that is good for both young and old. They do offer recipes, workout suggestions, and much more. The magazine takes little time to read, and seems to only serve as a springboard for more follow up on topics you enjoy. I think this is a better magazine to browse through at the supermarket than to purchase."
5,One of the best in this genre...,"I picked up this book in the UK prior to a visit to Italy. I loved every page. It's witty and fun and transports the reader to the hills of Liguria.The copy I bought is titled, ""Extra Virgin Amonst the Olive Groves of Liguria, a far better title than the one in the US. I believe it is the same book since the excerpts here are the same.Wonderful book. I hear she has another due out called Ripe For the Picking. Can't wait."
5,Italian Magic!,"Wonderful book for anyone who loves Italy, Italian culture, Italian cuisine and Italians! Complimenti a Annie Hawes!"
1,Devastating,"This book-on-tape was so good until the final chapter, where it became so horrible that I could not even finish it. I can't believe the publisher allowed such a cheap-shot ending. Why would the author finish such a lovely read with a fast tragic ending. A terrible disappointment."
2,bunchy elastic waist,"These didn't look as good in person as they did in the picture. They were a bit long, but what I liked least was the bunched up elastic waistband. Not flattering...."
5,It's a charming book about a girl who faced adversity headon,"I first read this book 60 years ago and still have my copy.Elnora has had a difficult time growing up, yet she is a genteel, caring person inspite of a totally nonsupportive mother. Her knowledge of nature made me feel that I was right there with her and no matter how often I read this book, it still brings tears to my eyes."
5,One of the best books I read while growing up,"Elnora Comstock is a driven and motivated country girl whose miserly mother does not want her to go to high school in town because it will cost too much money. Despite the harsh attitudes of her turn of the century single mother, Elnora manages (with the help of her neighbors) to attend school, excel in her studies, and make friends. She pays for her schooling with the help of a job with the ""Birdwoman"" -- she collects moths from the Limberlost. Her mother's continual grieving over an unfaithful and dead husband isolate Elnora from the other girls her age and hurts her deeply. Elnora's tale is a powerful and inspiring one, filled with nature, surprises, and an ending that leaves the reader satisfied. Read it"
5,a treasure,"Girl of the Limberlost was on the required reading list in my sophmore year of high school. It was one of the few books I truly loved as an adolescent. I saw the movie a few years ago done by Wonder Works and hated it though, so if you saw only the movie and was disapointed, please check out the book.It is about a girl named Elnora who has to deal with her verbally and emotionally abusive mother and the absence of her father. She is very poor and is seen as an outcast by her peers. One of her few friends is the ""Bird Woman"" a woman who collects moths from the Limberlost. Elnora becomes a collector too and makes money from it. She eventually finds happiness and falls in love and even receives an apology from her mean mother. I reommend this book for anyone, child or adult, over age 12."
2,"Times change, but hope never does","This book was written in 1921. Read by my grandmother, mother, and now myself. My Grandmother gave me her copy. My mother always said how she would have loved having a lunch box with compartments like Elnora's. My grandparents were pioneers in Southern Alberta and times were tough and money sparce. School was not free and it was hard work getting there. This book shows us how to focus on what is important and what it takes to get there. Though Elnora is fictional, there were thousands of young women trying to get educated in that time period. Thank you Gene for a beautifully written story of triumph and love."
4,Jean Stratton Porter,"This book was read to us by a teacher in our country school in Kansas, in 1955, when I was in the 5th grade. My brother, who was in the 2nd grade, asked me about it recently and so I ordered it for him, as I did ""Freckles."" We both enjoyed the books almost the same as when we were children. I believe Porter was a very gifted writer and would recommend her books not only to children but adults as well."
1,don't buy this edition,"This was one of my favorite books as a girl, so I was excited to buy a fresh copy and pass it along to a young friend. Unfortunately, this particular version is filled with errors -- including right on the back cover, where ""meet"" is misspelled as ""meat"". As in, ""She then meats and falls in love with a young man..."" Honestly! Then, in the very first sentence of the book, Elnora is spelled without capitalizing the ""e"" (it's capitalized elsewhere, so not just a stylistic choice). I didn't read further, but I'm suspecting there are plenty more to be found.I can't understand why more people haven't commented on this -- but do not waste your money on this edition!"
5,Lovejoy at his best,"Having read three other Lovejoy mysteries, Spend Game is far superior to the others (which are still quite good). The English physician who writes under the pen name of Jonathan Gash is a potent combination of having a vast knowledge of antiques and English life. Writing in the first person, as all Lovejoy mysteries are, is challenging, yet ""Gash"" does it so well. Spend Game starts with lots of action (Lovejoy sees a friend murdered in a staged car crash) and never lags a bit. Very highly recommended."
4,All Aboard the Lovejoy Train!,"In this tale, our lovable scoundrel is on the hunt for a precious model of a Victorian steam engine, although he doesn't know that that is what he will find at the end of this particular rainbow. Along the way we, the readers, are exposed to some more Lovejoy cheek. What a lovable villain he is! The description of his past experience in a tunnel is very realistic, and we also discover why tunnels are a main phobia with him. The more we learn about Lovejoy, the better, I think. We know how much he loves his antiques and women, but there is more to the man than that. This is an exciting story, and we find Lovejoy up against some pretty shady characters in his unending pursuit of the perfect piece. Enjoy."
4,"Very good magazine, no doubt.",The magazine is full of good references for any artist. Also puts you in contact with what others are doing in very different styles of painting. It's also complemented with a very good website. I'm very satisfied with this subscription. You always get something out of every issue.
2,Not what I had hoped for.,"I am just beginning to paint and was hoping to find a magazine with step by step instructions and patterns that I could use that would help me learn to paint a tree, flower, landscape and other subjects. This magazine is for Artists who really know their stuff and are looking for ways to sell their art and to read about other accomplished artists."
1,Unaceptablle production standards,The content is actually rather good. The paper is so thin and the color quality is so poor that most illustrations are valueless.I am not renewing.
5,Nice Quality!,I purchased this gift for my baby brother. I was very impressed with the size and quality. He really liked it and we are very satisfied with our purchase!
3,This video and other videos,"This video is not all that bad. The author tried his best and gives a lot of information and compared to most, it is more thorough.The reviewer from Lubbock, Texas who claims that you should not bother with any videos and only a teacher completely misses the point. It's like saying, don't go to the library and get books, go to school! One is not a substitute for the other! They can work synergistically with each other!"
5,This book has helped bring me closer to the Lord!,"I have a better concept of God's invitation to me to pray, instead of me coming to prayer and hoping that God will meet me there. I now see that it is Jesus who is prompting me to pray, and I am so blessed to understand that the Holy Spirit helps me to pray according to God's will so that I get results! I am excited to see what God wants to show me every time I pick up this book. It has been an ""eye-opening"" experience. I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for deeper intimacy and understanding of what a relationship with your Heavenly Father truely is. I am so blessed, and thankful to the author for writing this study for my own personal use!!"
2,Heroine very boring,"The plot of The Nabob's Daughter was interesting and the writing craftsmanship was excellent, but in my opinion the heroine, Anjalie, was very boring and one dimensional. She was constantly argumentative and all-knowing with decidedly modern sensibilities. There was nothing - and I mean nothing - she couldn't attempt, handle or do. I got so tired of her. The hero, Lord Chance, was more interesting. However, he couldn't save the book."
3,Great magazine but the Amazon package lacks,I bought this Print plus Kindle package only to find out that Kindle Cloud and Kindle for Android are not supported. I like the magazine itself as it gives me plenty of ideas and projects to work with. I'm pretty much a woodworking beginner and only look to do wood working during my free time. I'll still keep the print subscription but I am disappointed that my Kindle options are limited to nonexistent.
5,What a find !,"One of the top ten woodworking magazines around.I loved it, look forward to each issue. Almost as good as Handyman."
1,Capisette,I tried it for a weeks taking it once a day as directed on the bottle but I did not see any change. So I stopped.
5,Natural way to stop swelling.,Two capsules of capisette twice a day really has helped to reduce extreme swelling of extremities. This product was helpful where the advice of doctors did nothing too remedy this condition for 10 years. Skipping a dose results in only silght swelling. I recommend this product to those persons who have ths condition.
5,Product was GREAT,I tried taking EVERYTHING for Lymphedema complications of the leg. Everything else was frustrating and expensive. Capisette did exactly what is was suppose to. Now I am able to manage my lymphedema and live a more comfortable life and not break the bank or go to a fancy expensive doctor. If you continue to take this product it will continue to prove better results. GREAT PRODUCT I WISH I COULD GIVE 20 STARS!!!
1,Total waste of time and money.,Took it for 3 months and saw no results whatsoever. Would not recommend this product at all. It was a waste of time and money.
4,Enjoyable and smart,"This was a very fun read set in British academia. The dialogue (especially between the protagonist and his boss) is clever and smart. If you like words and wordplay this is a great mystery. Some of the Britishisms might be lost on Americans, but it is not a big problem at all."
5,Beats a 2 X4!,"I ordered these from Amazon because of the price. However, I can't tell any difference from the original and certainly a better price than what I can buy locally. And it only took less than 15 minutes to change so what are you waiting for?"
5,hood supports,they fit great and easy to install think they work better than the originals ones that was on there new
4,quirky with some great momments,"It's great to have a new William Finn score on CD. Like his previous ""Marvin"" trilogy (In Trousers, March of the Falsettos, and Falsettoland), the score not only reveals characters but moves the plot forward, as there is little spoken dialogue. There are some outstanding individual songs...""And They're Off"" is my particular favorite with its constant movement and drive. The bridge seems to come out of nowhere...and I like the way Finn constantly surprises you with his music. ""The Music Still Plays On"" is a lovely ballad that deserves a life beyond the show. In this age where so few shows with new scores are produced, this one definately deserves a hearing."
5,"yes, do get this","Ignore this book at your peril.TAOS by David Seabury may be the greatest pop psych/ self imp. book ever written.Read it along with Bertand Russell's 'Conquest of Happiness.'(I dont agree with all of Russell's ideas, yet the golden ones along the way make it worth the read.)Even if you aren't literary, get a copy of William Carlos Williams' 'Paterson' to keep on your shelf til you can warm up to it.Marjorie Greenbie is good too ('The Arts of Liesure,' harcover) and she is sane, yet humorous/ lighthearted. She hits very few bad notes. Another of the best pop psych books."
2,Couldn't finish...,"Too long, too wandering. It started out OK and I was interested in the characters, but then it just kept going and going and going...and the plot twists and added characters were NOT moving the story along, just bogging it down...I ended up putting it down intending to get back to it and ended up reading everything else I had waiting, and then STILL didn't pick it back up...and I pretty much finish everything I pick up...."
3,It talks to me!,"Always have to check the new LCD one out. Like the MGMT album, its starts good but after 6 or 7 songs in, I have to stop. Too much for me. I do like it though and Ill listen to it more."
5,Beautiful Music,"This CD contains some of the most beautiful music I have ever heard. The Klezmatics are first-rate musicians, and their blend of sounds here is very emotive. Chava Alberstein has a hauntingly rich voice, and her work here is outstanding. This album is among my all-time favorites."
1,The well CD,The CD I bought from this seller came with damage. I sent two emails and I never had any answer.I report to AMAZON they sent me an email but nothing happen.No respect for the buyer
2,Zumba,It wasn't what I expected.I thought I would be getting dancing excise.But instead it was all floor excise.Which I found it to be Boring..I gave it away!
1,zumba buns and thighs,This dvd would not play. Thought was going to be new but was just a burnt dvd in a case with a printed picture
1,Not what Zumba had advertised,This is not the active upbeat dancing excercise dvd that has been advertised. slow stretching on the ground is all you will get with this dvd.
2,This is Not a Dance Tape!,"This is Not a Dance Tape! Don't let the Zumba on the front cover fool you! It is pretty much a regular workout video, with some people dancing in between with no dance instructions."
1,Zumba Power,I didn't see anything in the description that said the 2 DVD's I purchased were in spanish. I would NEVER have purchased them. I just started taking classes and was so excited to get the DVD's so I could practice the new moves but after trying to get a little more workout time with these DVD's I am TOTALLY confused and very discouraged.
2,"Zumba Buns, Thighs and Abs","When I ordered this DVD I thought it was about Zumba dances and I was very dissapointed that it only contained floor exercises. Just because of the word Zumba on the cover, it was VERY expensive for the contents and duration, only 30 mins. and a few seconds. The only ""Zumba""-related thing was a latin music on the background. It should plainly say it is about floor exercises and eliminate the word Zumba from it, it is misleading. The exercises are good, but have nothing to do with Zumba."
4,MSL - Challenge,"I recently subscribed to Martha Stewart Living andhave found the articles, recipes, and photgraphyquite fascinating. There have been many commentshere regarding how out-of-reach the magazine is forpractical every day use, etc.Consider it a challenge to yourself to say heyI can do it. Give Martha credit, she knows herestuff and has the experience to help those whoneed and want it."
1,"First issue, old issue.","I recieved my first issue today. It is the June issue, which hit news stands 6 weeks ago. I would have preferred my first issue be a new issue rather than one that was printed 6 weeks ago. Who needs Father's Day recipes in the middle of July?"
2,Too Much Advertising,There is way too much advertising. Recipe's are copies of same ones on television and internet. Waste of my time.
3,I Let this subscription go,"By now most people have read my many reviews of the 16 Magazine subscriptions that I get. I LOVED this magazine for all of it's ideas and recipes.It's typical Martha Stewart fashion but at the price of how much it cost me to get it directly from her web-site I let it drop. Amazon[.com] offers a much better price but right now there are so many Magazines out there like this one that you almost can just subscribe to her web-site and get the same info without the cost.The articles were okay.... there was so much advertisment in the issues I got that I felt like I wasn't getting the true body of what I wanted. Pictures are Great but if you are subscribing for the recipes come to Amazon[.com] and buy her books, trust me it is less clutter than all of those magazines which are quite thick.Respectfully Reviewed"
2,Mediocre magazine at best,"I got a subsrciption to this magazine because I thought I would enjoy it and as a newly wed glean some ideas for my home and I couldn't have been more wrong. The recipes are overly complicated and some of the dishes just don't even sound like they would taste good and the same goes for the crafts. Any articles on decorating show drab, boring homes. Overall I was just very disappointed and will not be renewing."
5,Pure Inspiration!,"My all-time favorite idea was when Martha took baby pumpkins and made them into floral arrangements. That idea has been a wonderful addition to our Thanksgiving table and is one of the easiest floral projects ever!The recipes are very unique and the craft ideas...original. Plus, you can get some supplies from Martha's website which is an added bonus.The articles on gardening always teachme something I needed to learn.Of all the magazines I look forward to,this one is my favorite.~The Rebecca Review"
2,Not for real people,"Even though many projects in Martha Stewart Living magazine have nice style, they look better in the magazine than they do when you actually make them yourself! If you want creative, doable, budget-savvy projects designed for real people, try Do It Yourself magazine (made by the editors at Better Homes and Gardens). The instructions are great!!! I started subscribing last year and gave it to several friends as a holiday gift. It's my new favorite!"
3,The All-American rejects??,"OK, i've been listening and noticed that""can't stop, gotta date with hate"" from LP really sounds like ""The All-American Rejects - I'm waiting"" this is very lame.Compare these two you must hear it."
2,Willow,"I just didn't feel for Willow as i had all the previous characters. The series starts with Willow as a college student, returning home after a tradegy in the family. i won't spoil it, so that's all i can really say. It's the typical set up, except i really wish that the series has started earlier in Willow's life, like all of V.C. Andrews other series. I just didn't get to know Willow, she was boring, and the relationship with Thacther Happened rather quickly in my opinion. I did manage to finish it, so that's why it gets 2 stars."
4,Hungry!!!,"To me, I found this book to be very enjoyable! I chose not to read this until I read Hidden Leaves! This book gave me a glimpse of a subliminally ""unique"" teen boy!I also got hungry for cake...chocolate cake-like a certain Trans! It took forever to find out if Willow got the estate in her name or not?! Over all, I LOVED IT!"
1,Junk,"Couldn't get past the first fifty pages. It's the same old stuff, just a different setting, as usual. Of COURSE the ""dark family secret"" is that Willow's father had an affair that produced her - since when has the GW been creative and come up with something new? Just once, I'd like to read a VC Andrews that doesn't include the word ""real"" when describing a mother or father. The character letters at the end are nothing more than marketing plugs for the other books - maybe people are finally catching on that they're just not worth the money."
5,The best...,"series vc andrews has ever written. i've read the first 2 books and they were so good i stayed up all night reading them! a little racy, but all of her books usally are, aren't they?? ^_~"
5,Argueably the best rock record of all time...,There are very few albums that can compare to Tonio K. 's Life in the Foodchain. A strong combination of hard driving music and lyrics with a serious twist. This is a must have for anyone who appreciates good rock and roll.
3,"Good, but not great",I will not be renewing. This magazine is such a quick read that I will leave it to physician reception areas.
1,Picture does not match item received,"The item that was received is not the rose pattern that is on the plate in the picture. The plate I received features a floral tapestry motif on a green background along the edge . The picture is of the sweetbriar rose salad plate.Overall, this is wonderful china and I have really enjoyed using it."
4,"Trivia, little known facts",this is great book for the trivia buffs. i purchase the book when it originally went into print. this is my third time buying an dreading the book and i am still discovering it.
1,Not for Canon Powershot SX30 or Similar,"Does not work well on Canon Powershot SX30IS. Won't stay attached to the front of the flash, even if it would the screen would rest on the pop up flash minimizing diffusion. Did very funky things with white balance even if I used the flash setting. Had to hold the item in place and use a custom white balance. Even then I got strange blue lighting areas in my shots. Returning the item."
1,What a very disappointing product,"I'm glad that I didn't spend much on this diffuser for my built-in flash for my D80. This product not only diffused the flash, but also eliminated its effectiveness overall. Rather than getting some sort've soft light effect with this diffuser, I ended up getting underexposed shots (even with the flash strength boosted up to 1.0+). Thanks to the mediocre results I got from this product, I managed to just stick with my SB-400 in conjunction with an omnibounce diffuser. The pictures advertising this product look better than the product that you actually get. What you get is a plasticky/flimsy piece of material with velcro stickers to help attach it to your camera. Very disappointing indeed."
1,Trash,"What a terrible piece of equipment! First, it you have to VELCRO it to your camera, putting adhesive goo on your hotshoe. If you try tilting your camera, it falls off because of the poor fit. It is just a pain to use- make one yourself and save some grief and money."
3,I Don't Know,"Most likely, I'll never have use for this. I have so many other flash options. But if you don't, I think this will be better than nothing."
2,Not worth it.,"It does what it's supposed to but it's about as cool as wearing your socks over your jeans. It's also very clunky and hard to put on and keep on. But it does do what it's supposed to do and pics turn out nice.Update: After doing more tests, this thing is useless. Don't waste your money. The Gary Fong Puffer might be better from the results I've seen because of the curvature and microbumps."
2,Very homemade type solution with poor instructions,"First let me say that it will NEVER look as rounded and sturdy on your camera as it does in the product photo. Even when it's behaving well, it's going to look a little more jerry-rigged and flimsy. So far, it seems to help a little with providing more warmth and less blue/white glare to photos. But it's not necessarily what you think it is going to be from the photos, so if you want a headstart on making something homemade, go ahead and buy this. But if you expect it to look and perform super professionally, keep looking. I've seen a Gary Fong Puffer in action and it looks amazing. I've heard comments that it breaks easily used with Nikon cameras (something about the fit in the hotshoe) but I've got a Canon. It looks a lot sturdier than this and it performed really well in the shots my friend took."
2,Oh my,"I've not been a big fan of Norman Cooke's work. He's far too novelty-ish (is that even a word?) for my tastes. But this one just plain sucks. I don't know what it is. He's forgotten the fun for one, and second, he has too many songs that has real singers singing on them. Using samples is the way to go in this genre, good buddy."
3,Probably worth the price,"I felt a little cheated when i took this glorified paper fox out of the package...it looked flimsy and unconvincing to the human eye- however I put him by our pool where we had been having daily visits from ducks and lo and behold, we became duck free! Still seems pricey for what you get but I can't argue with its effectiveness and so far it is holding up well."
4,Very helpful to get executives oriented and thinking,"Donald Marchand has created a series case studies which describe how the leadership at different organizations used information collected during the course of business to better compete and even learn to dominate different aspects of their world. Well presented, but fragmented due to the nature of the case studies. The broad variation provide a reasonable footing for an executive who needs to get up to speed on what it means to truly leverage a company's information in the business world."
1,Very disappointed,Never received item. Supplier sent other bath lights that were less expensive and wanted me to pay the higher price. VERY disappointed. I suggest you drop this supplier as you still have these lights for sale by them!!!
1,don't waste your money,"I have a lot of experiance in tent camping, and currently own many tents. When I first got this tent I was extremly happy with it. I used it on a trip around the untited states. The first five nights were great (would give it a five), but after that the zippers broke, the seams started ripping, customer service did not seem to care. If you plan on using this tent more that 5 times, don't waste your money, because it will not hold up! I now own a usless cougar flats tent that I hate to throw away because it was so expensive."
4,This is a great tent,"Just went camping with two small kids. The tent layout is great, neat to have a sleeping space separate, we set up the front room almost as a front porch.Only complaint is the lame directions on putting the tent up, and the fact that there was no sleeve (despite directions that there was) to put the fly pole into.But the fly worked fine, and we figured it all out, so no bad no foul. Just a great tent."
1,Poor Quality Tent,"We purchased this tent a little over a year ago. We have used it approximately six times. Two seams are already ripping, the cord that holds the bay window open with a stake is torn, the rings that the stakes go through are broken, the zippers on the door have always snagged (you have to step on the tent at the bottom to pull it tight enough not to snag, and there are strings hanging all over where the seams are coming apart. It really is a shame, we loved this tent! It was very roomy."
4,Alive,I read the book Alive and really enjoyed it! I would recommend this book to anyone that would be able to handle reading about eating body parts. The book is about a plane that crashed over the mountains and what people had to do to stay alive. This book was sad in some parts because you have to remember that people went through hell trying to stay alive and had to live through life knowing that they ate their friends. This book is hard to put down and makes you think about how far you would go to stay alive.
5,Alive review by Zach,"""Alive"" is one of the few non-fiction books that I have enjoyed reading. It includes a vivid description of how a group of people survived in one of the harshest climates on Earth. Once you get into the book, you can immediately relate to the characters because of how easy it would be to end up in a similar situation. I would recommend this book to anyone who would like to read about a true story with a gripping plot."
4,Survival!!!,Alive is a great book if you like non-fiction. It goes into a lot of detail about everything that happened to the rugby team that crashed into the Andes Mountains. I like this book because it was a true story and showed the stregth and effort of the survivors.
4,A nice gift: A book,This book makes a nice gift for a person who heard about the event described in the book and is interested in learning more details.
3,A Bit Hard to Read,"Once I finally got into the book, this was a good story of survival. The men and women who crashed in the Andes had to overcome horrible situations -- injuries from the crash, an avalanche, and then the lack of food. What they did to survive was admirable, even if some may judge them harshly over their decision to eat the flesh of their dead friends.That being said, though, the story moves so slowly, and the author's writing style is so staid, that it took me forever to actually feel like I was reading something worthwhile.A good story, but it's a journey to plod through it."
5,A MUST READ,"Ever scince a friend recomended the book to me and I started to read the story, I was immediatley glued to the pages. This story about the plane that went down in the Andes Mountians is truly an invigorating narritve. I felt true sense of brotherhood among the group. As the number of survivors slowly decreased, the bond between those remaining grew stonger. You really have no idea what it was like to survive over seventy days in the Andes until you have read this story of those brave men whose will to survive was stonger than the pesimistic attitude that clenched them in the beginning. It may seem somewhat disturbing what these boys had to resort to, you can't deny the courage that would forever change them."
5,An excellent book!,It was a great book. We read it for English class and our group just loved it. We had a choice between some other books and this one seemed the most exciting. There was nothing wrong with it. It was a very moving story that made me think about how real it really was and that these people are still alive today. I reccomend this book to anyone who can handle the terrifying scenes.
2,Hardly Worth It,I bought this magazine for my 2 1/2 year old. She was not very interested in it. It is mostly full of ads. The activities are okay I thought but there are too few of them.
4,Ok Song but Great Remixed,"Sure 'Crazy' was mildly catching and 'Slave for you' had a nice beat but this song is the king..er queen of Britneys 'club worthy' songs. Not the original, so much as the re-mixes. These are all okay but the one they should have included was the Gabriel & Dresden Mix. I would normally never really listen to Britney but this re-mix is killer."
1,What happened to good music?,"Britney is back, but she is not necessarily improving. Looking back to her first and second albums, they were excellent. Her third one started sounding bad, and now she's back with ""Me Against The Music"". I hate this song just because it didn't have any notes in it. If Britney want her fans back, she needs to step up to the plate!"
3,Part 1 of a 2 Disc CD Single Collection,"1. Me Against The Music (Original) 4/5 - The original version. It's pretty good, not the best song on the CD though.2. Me Against The Music (Peter Rauhofer's Radio Mix) 2/5 - Probably one of the worst remixes out there. It's pretty slow and boring, Peter Rauhofer just sounds so bored here.3. Me Against The Music (The Mad Brit Mixshow) 3/5 - Again, this remix is pretty slow. Definitely better than the Peter Rauhofer mix, but still not that good.There are definitley better CD singles out there. This single claims to have ""exclusive remixes"", but you can find both of these remixes on the US 7 track CD Single (Me Against the Music). The only real reason to buy this is because it's part 1 of a 2 disc CD Single collection, so only buy it if you're a die hard fan."
1,Me Against the Music - the name says it all,"I'm glad to see that Britney Spears has at least publicly acknowledged that she has been waging a war against music. It's still too early to see if good music will win out, or if Britney and her legions of evil who gave her a record contract will ultimately achieve unholy victory.Britney Spears exemplifies what is wrong with the music industry today. There's now just a few corporate conglomerates using their resources try to sell people bad music like this. All the radio stations in this country are practically owned by only two companies, Viacom and Clearchannel, who want the same limited number of ""recognizable"" songs played so as to maximize their advertising revenue. Radio listeners are less likely than ever to have access to good music.Avoid this kind of heavily-promoted garbage and seek out some good music. It's out there if you look for it."
3,Dracula: Awesome. Transcribers: Should Be Fired,"I've never read Dracula, obviously I was not dissapointed. It was an excellent read. UNFORTUNATELY, the volunteer transcribers should be fired. Many took artistic liberties changing some words to innappropriate things. At points they would enter the same noun repeatedly throughougt two to three pages....In addition, whoever transcribed Van Helsings passages started writing out CHAPTERS in yoda speak. It was EXTREMELY irritating and even offensive. It ruined the ending of the book. Thanks transcribers!! Ya jerks!"
4,"A really exciting page turning book, every minute.","Wow! This book is awsome! Even though it was required reading after reading the first few pages I was hooked. It is amazing how someone is able to write something as good as this. The only thing I didn't quite like was the way some things kept staying the same, like when Mina Harker was getting hypnothised. For a few days she said pretty much the same things. What would make this a better book would be more interesting variations."
3,Dracula Special Addition,"I realize that images don't look great on the Kindle. But the black and white woodcut feel of them gives reading material on a Kindle a certain vibe. This would have fit perfectly with the Special Kindle addition of Dracula. Unfortunately the special edition version contained none, not even a cover. It's too bad, three have been some great cover illustrations dating back as far as 1913 that would have been great."
2,Dracula Falls Short of Expectations,"I am fond of Bram Stoker's method of retelling the tale of Dracula from the vantage point of many different characters via their journals. At times however, these journal entries became rather wordy with extraneous information. I am glad that some of the characters' hopes and fears are explicity expressed, but then others' are not which is disappointing. The main female character, Mina Harker, is treated as an equal to the male characters (she was praised for her typing skills and her courage) and at the same time thought of as delicate and someone that needs protecting. It is a rather confused example for women's liberation to say the least. And my last comment deals with the fact that the ending falls horribly flat. All this suspense is built up, then in the final climatic scene (man vs monster) there's no struggle and it's all over very quickly without the extreme details given in the previous scenes. I expected something more from a ""Classic"" horror novel."
2,"Revised, but readable","This refers to the 'Townsend Press edition'. I read this book, satisfied with the story, but somehow I had an odd feeling...something was missing; and in the afterword confirms it; this has been edited ""for 21st century Americans"". It flows faster but lacks detail. Stick to the original, read reviews for every edition!"
2,Started great and then sank!,"When the main character was in the Count's castle I had a great time! I thought, this book is great, it can only get better, boy was I wrong. It went to London, and stayed there too long, the dead woman thing dragged on way to long. I didn't even finish it. I'm willing to give it another chance latter but for now, forget it."
3,"Worthwhile, though frustrating at times.","The first and last portions of the book are the most compelling. I felt as though the middle portion would never come to a conclusion. The format was difficult for me to become accustomed to as it is mostly compromised of journal and diary entries, newspaper clippings, and telegrams.That said, I do find it to be a worthwhile read as it is interesting to read the book that so much has been based upon since. The characters, although two-dimensional in some respects, provide interesting glimpses into the concepts and stereotypes of the time. The deep conviction shared by the main group of characters towards the accomplishment of a most important goal is compelling.Give yourself plenty of time to finish this as rushing through it will only lead to frustration due to the format used to tell the story."
5,Classic,"This book has inspired many, many movies but this is the real thing. It shows the story in the eyes of all the main characters."
4,First horror story I liked,I almost did not read it because I dont like horror stories. I then realized I had never read the book or seen the movie. Was just new it from the remarks and jokes people make. The book was written in 1897 but this story is timeless. It is classic I wonder how I had missed it before.The original vampire story before all this twilight stuff.
4,Dracula,"This makes about the fifth time I have read the book Dracula by Bram Stoker. This last time that I read it, I really had to make myself focus on it hard on the beginning of the book. The book is very good book for people too read. Many people can easily be brought into the way Stoker puts the details into the work. He has a lot of good descriptions of where Dracula lives and also by what Dracula looks like. He makes you think that you are in the story too.This book can also be very creepy at times. All the way through out the book, it gets more and more interesting. If you are a person who likes scary books, then Dracula is a book for you. I choose this book because I found it very interesting."
5,Best Vampire Book Ever Written!,I just finished reading Dracula by Bram Stoker and I gotta say I loved it! I can't believe I just read it for the first time.The edition I bought on amazon is wonderful. It was at first hard to understand but I really got into the story and it became easier for me over the course of reading it. I have read some very good vampire books but this one has to be the best at keeping the suspense.A classic that really does stand the test of time. Im very happy to have added this classic to my personal library.
4,Was very surprised! Really Liked it!,"I downloaded this to my kindle because it was one of the free ones and thought it would be good. I was worried when i first started reading it because it is told from journals. However, it makes it much better than from a 3rd party. It was very good!"
3,a decent read,"For some reason this book by Bram Stoker did not fulfill my high expectations for it. Many of my reading friends recommended the book so I was pleased to get a copy of the ebook and began reading it. Had some trouble keeping reading as I wanted to read other things and had to keep coming back to finish. It was ok but unfortunately for me it did not live up to what I had been led to expect.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
2,I didn't really care for this,This was one of the first books I read on my Kindle and got it because it was free. Thank God I didn't waste money on it. I found it hard to follow and not very engaging. I think I will stick with Anne Rice for my vampires.
2,Lacking :-(,"After watching and reading vampire stories through the years I was a little ashamed that I knew nothing of the original vampire(Dracula) and decided to take a shot at the book. This is where personal opinions come into place, the book that has been considered a classic for many years in my opinion is lacking in a lot of things that would make the story more interesting. The story is boring to me and for the first time ever I considered the movie ""Dracula"" by Francis Ford Coppola much better than the book by a big stretch."
3,Bram Stoker's Dracula,"I've had this book in my TBR pile for years...I thought I'd never get to reading it. The story is told mostly through diary entries, newspaper articles and letters.I like how Bram Stoker sets the mood. There is a general dark and errie mood to the story.This was a classic horror story. The characters are creepy. Dracula himself is a monster. You don't get the story from his point of view, but you do see it from his victims points of view. I don't see Dracula romanticized in the book, the way he is in the films. In the book, he is nasty, and just plain evil.All in all, this was a good book. I'm glad I read it. My only problem with it was that it was toooo long. I feel like Bram Stoker could have cut it short. It was very drawn out."
3,"This ""Illustrated"" Edition Is Disappointing","I'm a big fan of Dracula - the story. I'm collecting the Illustrated Junior Library Editions of children's classics because the illustrations are usually lovely - can't be beat. In this Dracula edition however, there are three illustrations in the entire book and they are not impressive."
3,E-Book,I have read many dracula books and saw the movies that the book was about. I never finished the book.
4,"Great idea and first four chapters, but goes downhill from there","Although Stoker is not the greatest at creating sympathetic human characters, I really enjoyed his now infamous monstrosities, Dracula and the weird sisters. The Transylvanian setting is commendable as well. Unfortunately (and this is terrible), it seems that Bram Stoker did not realize his true talent. The rest of this story is mostly about his flat human characters from London, the most annoying of which is Mina, who tries to act mysterious by giving Van Helsing an unintelligible diary as a joke. The most redeeming aspect of the rest of the novel is Lucy's suspenseful struggle against death, but after she finally dies, the author really has nothing left going for him. This is the trendsetting vampire novel however, so I highly recommend it nonetheless."
1,Very disappointing,"As awesome as Dracula started out and as amazing some sections were within the first half, the book as a whole is a huge yawn. I saw this on a few lists of best horror novels of all time (even on a list as one of the scariest books of all time) and I could not disagree more. As I approached the end of the book, I began to wonder ""how could this end yet, only fifty more pages to get to the climax of the book and start on the gore by the Count or to the Count?"". Fifty pages turned into thirty, then twenty, then ten, and alas Bram got to the climax (if you can call such a disastrous ending) and began and ended it within a paragraph. No gore, no horror, no nothing. I wanted this to be something of horror lore, but it signifies only a waste of time and money."
2,Past its prime and victorian to boot!,"I don't especially care for scary movies or books, so I've avoided this book over the years. However, with the preponderance of vampire lit in our culture I thought I'd finally crack the binding of this book. I didn't find it particularly spine-chilling or evocative-- perhaps I'm deadened to such paltry imagery summoned here compared with our modern mediums. Still, the plot was decent and as the progenitor of so much culture within the hoi polloi it is consistent with the recommendation of a must read."
2,Why is this a Clasic?,"OK, why is this book required reading for high school students? It is very long and I think that Bram Stoker was german anyway that's gotta get people confused. All of the sentances are backwords! It took me 4 whole days to read it, my entire thanksgiving weekend. So highschoolers if you have a choice...don't read this book."
1,Blah.,"Just one word. Blah. It's hard to understand, creepy, and disgusting. If you're like me, just tring this book to make yourself feel brave, forget it. I recommend The Name Of This Book Is Secret, or Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.(Remember to not get the original book) In the long and short, this book is @&?#%$!"
1,"horrible, boring ""classic""","Maybe I've read too much Sookie and Twilight, but I thought that this ""classic"" of Dracula. Sucked. Literally. I am SO GLAD I got this book free on my kindle or I would have been pissed off. I have no idea how this is a classic. Its a very boring book & alot of questions never get answered. I was left thinking ""thats it? this is what all the hype has been about?"""
3,Not as good as I thought it would be,"The beginning of the book is gripping, but after about 70 pages it bogs down. There is way too much forced dialogue and it's really kind of boring. The end is also something of a letdown. Read it if you want. It's not horrible, but nothing great."
3,A Novel that Has Seen Better Days,"Maybe this was good reading when it was first published over 100 years ago, but it can't compare with today's novels for readability and interest to modern readers. The characters are boring, and the book is about 200 pages longer than required to tell the story. It does give some insight into the lifestyle of well-to-do Europeans of that era. It even has an intelligent woman in it, which is more than can be said of some books from that time. The price was right: free on Kindle!"
3,Better than I expected,"It was interesting to see how the legend of Count Dracula began. I thought it was worthwhile reading; the vehicle for telling the story consisted of journal entries, letters, and excerpts from newspaper articles."
4,The one and only,"Stoker's ""Dracula"" is the book that served as the foundation of the vampire legend that has since spread through the whole of western society. Written as a series of letters and journal entries in a quaint Victorian style, Stoker's work is heavily reminiscent of other authors of that time period, including Doyle and Poe.The vampire mythology that has sprung up over the last century has has greatly revamped the powers and weaknesses of Stoker's monster, the core remains. The dreaded Count Dracula leaves his Romanian castle to come to London, to search for the fresh blood he desires to quench his insatiable lust. A group of Englishmen must uncover the nature of the beast in order to destroy it and protect their loves.While the book seems somewhat more lengthy and wordy than need be, and its vampire seems almost tame in comparison to modern versions, it still serves as a great reminder how this all began."
3,Good Story,I know this is a classic but I just could not get into the story. Thought I would try electronic books but I need the paper feel when reading.
5,love it,I downloaded the book because my husband loves books about Dracula you will love the book is awesome I read it
4,A classic!!!,"Although some times a slow story, this classic book honors the never-ending cult to Count Dracula. A must read for everybody."
2,fast-paced adventure....,"....but rather pulpish. It says something about a book when some of the movie versions are actually better. Good light adventure, but no real depth, with the Count being just a cardboard bad guy.He's plenty evil all right, but the more psychologically minded reader less inclined to moralizing (and flag-waving) will wonder, ""What's behind this?"" and not find satisfaction.If you want a tragedy with real depth to it, read Shelley's FRANKENSTEIN."
3,Too big for its breeches.,"Cardboard characters. Impenetrable Cockney accents at some points. A completely two dimensional story. If you enjoy reading the Bible, you'll enjoy this. I would have given it only two stars, but I must cut some slack for the fact that it was written over a hundred years ago, and this type of writing must have been avante garde. The movie with Gary Oldman is better."
2,Doesn't stand the test of time,"Written in a journal form of various character, it chronicles Dracula, the vampire from Romania, venturing into London. The first 100 pages of the book are mesmerizing, the journal of Jonathan Harker traveling and staying in Dracula's castle is amazing. The fear, the dread, the sinister Count and elegant prose all add to feel of a great horror novel.Then the rest of the book comes along. What once was a horror movie becomes pure Victorian drivel, with laughably divination for the two females, Lucy and Mina, that not only destroys the readability with the extreme flowery nature of their banalities, but detracts from the true horror that Stoker brings about in the first 100 pages.The last fifty pages are interesting, as they are on the quest to destroy Dracula, but the drudgery of language and the previous 300 pages destroy all hope of enjoying this book."
1,Get it Free Elsewhere,Why is this even listed? This short work is in the public domain and can be found for free elsewhere on the internet. I suspect Amazon is just inflating its Kindle books count by including works like this.Put it on you Kindle for free elsewhere.
4,Great read second time around,"I read ""Dracula"" when I was in high school 45 years ago. It was both frightening and fascinating back then. The second time around did not disappoint. It is full of historical information for its time period. This book is frightening, fascinating, informative and simply well written. A classic of the horror genre that gradually draws one in."
1,Why is this edited?,"Why is this text so disfiguringly edited? This edition of the classic novel has been rewritten in colloquial ""common"" American English. And not well... it reads like a Goosebumps novel, and there is absolutely none of the natural flow of the language that made the original text so enjoyable to read. It seems almost like this is one of those attempts to write old literature in a fashion more appropriate for ""young adult"" readers. Even if this is the case (and there is absolutely no indication judging by the cover or the contents leading up to the first chapter that this is true), the problem is that this is edited badly... very very badly. This is a shameful ruination of Bram Stoker's fantastic story. I implore anyone who finds this review to rather search for another edition. There is a reason this one is so cheap."
4,Different than I expected,"My only experience with Dracula has been with movies, so my expectations were entirely different. I found the novel very enjoyable and found the style to be interesting; it gave me a way to see the story from several points of view. I had expected more of the story to take place in Dracula's castle instead of most of it taking place in London.This is the first novel that I read on my kindle and I have already started reading several other books on it. It is a good way to go through books and is easy on the eyes.This free edition is basically text with no table of contents or links, but for a novel that is fine with me. The Kindle search function allowed me to do a search for `chapter' and I was able to create my own table of contents. I always like to know roughly how long a chapter is when I read and this was a very simple way to find out."
5,got this for my neice,This a cute gift to give to any little girl (or boy) who likes pink and who likes horses. My 5 year old niece loves it! It's pretty well made too so it was last a long time.
5,Amazing we haven't heard more of Joe!!,"This is just a general comment on Joe Purdy and ALL of his music. I can not say enough about EVERY CD by Joe Purdy! I just wish I could get his first couple of CD's - Joe Purdy as well as Sessions from Motor Ave. He has a sound similar to Jack Johnson and Matt Costa, YET he has a sound all of his own. It is music you can listen to and I SO enjoy it!!I first heard Washed Away on LOST & The City on Grey's Anatomy and bought the sound track for THAT song. I then went and searched and searched for more of his music!! Glad to see it is available through Amazon now :)"
4,"Good, solid CD","I never heard of Joe Purdy until listening to XM radio last week. I heard the song ""The City"", which is probably my favorite on the cd. Other highlight include ""Look At Me Now"" and ""Why Do I"".. His singing reminds me of Jesse Malin. This cd is solid through and through."
2,"Great size, but doesn't hold up in the wash!","These are the perfect size to use on a nursery or pack and play changing table. However, when you wash them just a few times they get really ""nubby"" and look like they've been throug World War II. If I knew where my receipt was, I'd return them! I expected more from a brand name such as Carters."
2,So many other wonderful games to buy -- don't bother with this one,"I played this twice last night and it goes on almost an hour which is too long for a light card game like this. The artwork and board are wonderful but that is the best thing about this game. If you have an hour to play games with your family & friends, try Settlers of Catan instead. If you need a shorter game, try Rumis. If you want a fast card game, check out Escalation. If you like word games, get Typo. But stay away from this one."
5,Ghost Story,"Another wonderful job by Mr. Bahr. I had read Black Flower a few years ago, and absoluetly loved it. The Judas Field is most certainly on par.His novels on the Civil War reach far beyond the battlefields themselves. He truly has a strong grasp on the psyches of those who lived and fought this war. And his ability to paint the southern landscape is breathtaking at times.His characters are true grit, with incredible depth.While he has written three, on topic, this is only the second I have read. I will most definetly be going back for the third.If not for authors such as Bahr, I'd unlikely read very much fiction at all."
3,BIG HEAD,I collect the Holiday Barbie's and that is the only reason I would buy this one I personally don't like her new look......
3,"I agree Barbie's head is too big, and lacks detail.",I agree with the many opinions of others - that Mattel is making a big mistake with the large size of Barbie's new head. It looks ridiculous. The eyes do not have an upper lid ridge to make them look more realistic. They now look like decals. Also there are too many painted lashes. Now the eyes look like spider decals. Too much color used in the face painting give her a clown-like quality. The last nice head sculpt was the 1977 superstar head mold. The face look more realistic.
1,Incompetent head of Mattel wants a big head barbie like his!,"I truly began to question why is it that a toy that has weathered so many years and economic changes, and still is known around the world, would suddenly have features and quality that only an incompetent fool would approve of. Collectors have made Barbie a household word, and through them their children have carried the torch for Barbie. Seems only too fitting that people know why this is occurring. [...]"
5,Wonderful,"I never really had this doll when it first came out.I was 10 at the time and now im 5 years older.I personally think this is the best holiday barbie they have created, and the head is fine."
3,It's ok.,"Space inside is good. Configurable shelf placings are great. The front display is bright, can double as night light for your kitchen. Temperature settings can be 'locked' from being modified.The touted features (quick cold zone, thaw, etc) aren't as effective as advertised. No light for ice and water dispensers. Extremely tough during nights without turning on the light. No locking mechanisms to prevent dispensing of water and ice."
1,Rosie is not that thin!!!,"Rosie's face is so obviously airbrushed it makes me sick. They got rid of at least one of her many chins! If celebrities are trying to suck money out of my pocket, I at least expect a bit of honesty on their part. (This is not something I would ever buy, but since I saw how they made Rosie lose 100+ pounds I just had to put my 2 cents in...)"
3,Not the first game I reach for...,"it's ok, but not great fun. maybe it just makes my tiny brain work too hard. I did see this game via Mental Floss magazine. I'm going to continue to expose my family and friends to it...maybe it will click with some of them and hence make it more fun for me. full disclosure: the only time I played it so far was with my 14 year old son, and it was just the 2 of us. will keep playing and update my review."
2,Best watched with your eyes closed,The conducting is good. The singing is a big rough in places but generally good. What's the catch? This is the WORST staging of the ring I have ever seen. I have trouble imagining how such an abomination could ever have been produced. The whole thing views like a Monty Python skit. Best watched with a towel covering the screen above the sub-titles.
5,Awesome book!,"I've always loved the original Charlie Brown Christmas special, and this book is a treasure trove of great ""behind the scenes"" info on how it was all put together!"
1,This is a modified edition of Milton's original; beware!,"Prospective buyers of this edition should be aware that it is edited; some of Milton's words have been changed, either to modernize or to ""humanize"" (that is, eliminate sexist usages by the replacement of he/she, him/her, etc. with bizarre ""hu"", ""hum,"" etc. This is not a worthy edition of Milton's great text!"
3,Cowboys in Siberia?,"I have a lot of respect for Nancy Pearl, after listening to her book reviews for many years on NPR, and that was what led me to read a ""cowboy"" book which I would not ordinarily touch with a 10-ft pole. And indeed, this is definitely NOT Louis L'Amour. The premise is a herd of American cattle that has been bought by an obscure village in Siberia and must be delivered by cowboys from the ranch that sold them. Once they reach Russia, the cowboys are joined by a group of cossacks from the village, determined to see that the cattle arrive safely. The book is full of perils avoided and not avoided, cowboys and cossacks reluctantly getting to know each other, high-minded sentiments that don't quite ring true, and some mildly amusing cowboy humor. I don't regret reading it, but I'll take Nancy Pearl's recommendations with a little more salt in the future."
5,Entertaining enough to read again and again,Grew up reading westerns. This is one of the best and Huffaker has become one of my favorite authors. What has happened to him?
3,Good book damn poor western,"This book was highly recommended in one of my weekly magazines,so I read the reviews on amazon and when it was rated right up with Monty Walsh I had to have it. What a disappointment. I doubt that the writer ever saw a live cow or horse for that matter. The writer has a wild imagination, but no knowledge of the subject matter."
2,Very difficult to read,"As a huge fan of Sophie's Choice, I decided to try this one. It may be ""great art"" since the critics all love it but it shouldn't be this difficult to read a book. Virtually no characters are likable. The story is totally depressing and repetitive. I almost didn't finish it but at some point decided to go down with the ship. Probably won't read another Styron."
1,Glad it's finally over,"Yes this is beautifully written, ""masterful prose"". I wholeheartedly agree. Enjoyable reading? Definately not. I didn't find it depressing. I would sum it up as bad things happening to bad people. Not one major character had any redeeming quality at all. That's not the problem, though, for me anyway. I don't know the right word, long winded? rambling? For example, in one of the final sections of the book Peyton is speaking in about a hundred page long, all one paragraph, stream of consciousness. It's the culmination of the whole book, leading up to her suicide. It would be the most interesting reading yet, I thought, but it felt like it would never end. For me reading shouldn't be work and this was a lot of work to get through and I didn't feel like it was worth the effort."
4,Good Clear Recipes,Not a bad book. A bit less crunchy than some others which is good for contrast. I prepare all the meals for my wife and since she has become pregnant it has become significantly more difficult to keep her happy. This book has helped.
4,Great 1st equestrian magaine!,I purchased a subscription for my granddaughter last year - and she enjoyed it so much that she requested another year ... says it is veryinformative and touches on Western as well as English seat ... She iseleven years old and does not own her own horse (yet) - rides a couple time a week at a nearby stable and takes a weekly lesson. The posters cover the walls of her bedroom and she is still in the 'dreaming' to own a horse stage.
5,Happy,Surprised how fast the subscription was activated it was only three weeks instead of the stated six to eight weeks. My grandson was so excited about the magazine and so was I.
1,Damaged during shipment,It's to close to the Holidays to worry with this book. It arrived messed up on the ends. Since this was a gift did not want to give something that looks used. I have since found it in a store close by but really disappointed in the way this item was packed without cushioning therefore book arrived damaged. It is to much hassle to try and print out a label and mail it back so it went to charity. Hope Amazon improves on packing items so nothing arrives damaged.
4,Happy Jingle Bugs,"I've been collecting pop-up books for several years now and am trying to purchase as many as I can of David Carter's Buggy Pop-up Books! They are absolutely great for children, so colorful ... but I'm, of course, collecting them for myself. My grandchildren are too old for them so I'm waiting for my great-grandchildren to enjoy them!"
3,light and music didn't work,"This is a cute book for the a toddler (my 16 month old son LOVES these books), but this book is not the winner Halloween Bugs is (I highly recommend-- plus, bugs fit in better for that season). But this book is fun and cute nonetheless. Problem is, the one light in the whole book, along with the music, is the last page, and neither work! The light doesn't light up at all, and the music is this pathetic dying noise. I'd exchange it, but don't think I want to mess with shipping it back. I'd say buy this book if you think your little will enjoy it, but don't be too disappointed if the last page doesn't work.UPDATE: I have since returned this book for a new one, and the new book is working great. Both my 16 month old and 3 yr old love it. The only problem is how my 16 month old isn't gentle with these books, but it is worth the price, even if I have to replace it one day."
4,Stories You'll Never Forget,"I don't believe I've ever read a more memorable collection of stories. Ellison does a very good job of bringing plausibility to seemingly outlandish plots. I had this collection when I was a kid, and I'm ecstatic to have it in my library today!"
1,Waste of Money,"Thankfully, I was able to get the company I work for to purchase this, and didn't have to pay for it out of my own pocket. I would be angry if I payed the price that is listed and recieved this DVD. It is NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!!!!!!! It is boring, and outdated. It looks like it was made about 25 years ago. It is not very informative, and the content is suitable for a middle school level of cognition. Don't waste your money!"
3,unfun,I subscribe to quite a few travel magazines. This one has so much advertising that I tend not to read much of it. The slant is very serious and definately geared toward the wealthy/business people. Not very much real usable information. Just not very fun. The font is tiny and nearly cumbersome to read...doesn't have much class or sass.
3,its fine.,Not a lot of in-depth coverage. Its has a few good pointers but not what I was hoping for in a travel mag.
5,Excellent service,I ordered this book because I had already read it years ago and wanted to get a copy for my library. I was very pleased when it arrived less than 10 days later. It's an excellent story about the life of the men who followed Jesus Christ while he walked the earth. Very thought provoking and captivating. I could not put it down the first time I read it and will probably do the same this time. The bookJohn - Son of Thunderwas in mint condition and the price was very reasonable. My experiences with most of my Amazon.com purchases have been similar. Thanks.
1,What a stupid book,"This book is very silly. If you want a sensible book explaining the virtues of the family bed, read William Sears."
5,A Must-Have,"Don't be fooled by the pretty faces on the cover. This is one of the savviest newsmagazines around. Read it and love it for the crackling writing, the grown-up humor, and the inside story. Then treat yourself to the dish about the sins of the rich (who are usually NOT the people in the tabloids, but mysterious financiers who live offshore and have dark and shady pasts...) and a brief interview with the cover celeb. It's one of the best monthlies available."
5,My Fave Mag by a Mile!,"Why do I love Vanity Fair? It has such a great mix of all the things I want to read. Political issues, true crime articles, great Hollywood interviews, wonderful pictures and news items that are up to the minute. Recently my husband and I traveled to Maine and I read almost the entire thing to him while we were in the car. Enough stuff for both of us to love. I pass this on to my whole family and they can't wait. Dominic Dunn's Diary is a must-read as well. I always feel like I'm stepping into the ""in crowd"" when I read it's pages!"
1,STILL WAITING....,"Unfortunately, I am still waiting for the magazine to show up at my doorstep. It has been a FULL 5 weeks, so I hope next week is the winner!"
3,I have not received my Vanity Fair yet!,I can't believe it's taking so long. Will I get the May and June issue? Paid for it the first part of May. Hmmmm still waiting!I used to take it and love the magazine but darn when will it get here?
1,You're serious?,"How do you expect me to review a product which I haven't received yet? No I don't HATE this magazine, but the survey insisted I rate it - I couldn't give it no stars, so I gave it one."
2,"Boring, superficial, and cheap","This magazine is stuffed with often decadent ads of expensive clothing, usually dull photos geared to readers in their sixties, and parties featuring aging celebrities. I usually flip through this magazine in a fairly short time. However, every once in awhile there is an extensive, well-researched article. The last I can remember is a fascinating feature several years ago about the contemporary art scene before the financial bubble burst. Great stuff. Otherwise, I can't see this magazine lasting another five years. Mostly flash, little substance."
5,La plus belle histoire d'amour au monde!!!,"""L'ecumes des Jours"" est la plus jolie histoire d'amour que j'ai eu la chance de lire. Boris Vian nous invite dans son monde romantique et contemporain.Les characteres du roman sont ingenues et innocents, le monde materiel ne les touche pas. Ce livre est un plaisir a lire et vous touche profondement. Vraiment inoubliable!!"
5,Life Changing,"This movie changes the way a person thinks of God! We've put Him in a box according to our limitations. But He is not limited. His normal for us is so far beyond what we live, and this movie propels me to want more---to live in God's normal, which is to change people's lives no matter what the circumstances. My first response to someone's sickness needs to be, ""can I pray for you? God wants to touch you!"""
2,No evidence,"I commend the director for trying to follow a documentary format. However, what he documents is not the ""Finger of God"" but rather the lack of evidence offered by those who claim to invoke miracles in the name of Jesus. It shows unconvincing magic tricks played on the poor and uneducated, who go away mildly impressed in most cases. No serious inquiry or independent verification of verbal testimony is provided."
3,Worth Seeing,The film starts off slow but it gets better. Very interesting but not a life changing movie experience for me. The power of prayer is real & for that it's worh seeing.
3,Nice action...not much else,"Wow, this is a sequel to a remake of a French film. This movie has nice action, but the acting and plotting are more or less typical. An entertaining rental if you can find it."
3,"OK, but not that impressive as the original canon","Works fine, just the extreme Blue Sky does not come out as with the original Canon Polarized Filter"
2,"Filthy, pitted filters","Both of the Tiffen filters I bought (2 separate orders, a few weeks apart) arrived smeared with some kind of greasy gunk.It was extremely difficult to get them clean.What ever the stuff was just got smeared around, and it took me forever to get it all off.I still worry that there may be a film of it left on there that will degrade the clarity of my photos.It wasn't worth the hassle to return them, but next time I need a filter, I won't buy Tiffen."
3,Thread is not very deep.,"The optical quality of this polarizer is all fine, however the thread, both inside and outside is *very* short. It only takes a quarter of a revolution to screw it in, meaning it can very easily come loose and fall on the ground. I would recomment getting a filter with a deeper thread if you want to be safe you don't accidently unscrew it while rotating the filter."
5,Light Loss is normal with CPLs,"Filter works fine for the price. It does exactly what a circular polarizer is supposed to. As for the user below who says it causes light loss he's obviously new to photography, all cpl's cause 2 stops of light loss, no matter which brand, how many coats they have."
5,works great,This filter works great. I have used this filter on a Nikon 18-70mm lens and have produced excellent pictures. I have yet to experience any flare with this polarizer. Great polarizer for a great price.
3,Not sure why it isn't doing as it should :(,"It doesn't seem to adjust when turned as it should, no clue why. Works ok...but, wish it did asmy other polarizer did and went light to dark when tuurned."
5,circular polarization,"I bought both this Tiffen circular polarizer and the Tiffen Haze-1 filter at the same time. Shooting across a broad valley on a sunny day at some distant mountains I used both filters separately and together. The circular polarizer did a better job of reducing the obvious haze producing more saturated colors both in the viewfinder and on film. The Haze-1 did deliver a noticeable effect, but the circular polarizer was better and is priced accordingly. The atmospheric haze was so bad on that particular day that, without the filter(s), the resulting images were useless. I had also tried a cheap no-name circular polarizer for comparison. This Tiffen was superior to the no-name by a wide margin."
4,Not bad for the price,"I bought this filter as part of a package with a UV and a warming filter through Amazon. They're all Tiffen thought the Polarizer is what I really wanted.In use I can see difference in colour saturation especially in blue skies which actuall gained a richer contrast from the white clouds. On the downside, if you're using a wide-angle lens, expect to get some vignetting on the corners. That turned out to be just annoying when reviewing my shots. I also noticed an increase in noise on my shots but I cant say for sure just yet if this was due to the filter.Im an amateur so I guess I cant complain about what I got for this price range. But in hoping to develop in the field, I think next time I'll put in the extra to get a better more professional filter. Be sure to try shooting B&W; with the polarizer, you'll enjoy the results."
4,"Good quality, works well","A circular polarizer should be standard equipment for everyone with a SLR digital camera, and Tiffen makes a good product. My sole complaint is that I found the same lens in a store for 50 cheaper a week after buying this one..."
1,polarizing filter,This filter doesn't do much of anything. I should have listened to the reviews. JUNK Save your money for a better one.
1,must be defective,"l purchased this polarizing lens but returned it today for a refund. as i rotated the lens to create a different look nothing happened. l have read the positive reviews on this lens, i guess i just received a defective one, either that or these people know nothing of what they say. i have never had a polarizing lens fail as this one has. hb"
3,As expected for Tiffen,"It does prevent some flare but the main reason I use it is for protecting my lens. However, it does let flare in so that's why I'm giving it 3 stars"
3,Very Limited Range in Apartment Building,"The specifications on this chime claim that it works up to 100 feet. That may be true, but if you are considering using it in building with brick, concrete or steel walls as I was, be aware that the range is far less. To be precise, I could not get the chime to ring at a distance of 25 feet. The mini-manual does state that concrete and steel will limit the effective range, but when it cuts the range down more than 75%, it made it useless for me. As they say, your mileage may vary..."
2,Not worth it,"We have a small retail store and wanted something to alert us when customers entered out store front. This chime worked well for maybe a week. We tried replacing batteries and code pins, but no luck."
2,"Buy something else, dont waste your time",This thing only works at about 20 feet(line of sight) and doesnt work all the time. I would not suggest this product to anyone
3,Product Description is misleading!,"Be warned! This item is NOT a doorbell or ringer, where people at your front door push a button to summon you. It is ONLY an entrance alarm/charm, for use in businesses to alert when a customer enters a shop!In the picture, the middle sized item is a sensor/transmitter which you mount on the doorjam and the small one is a magnet, which you mount on the door. When the door opens and they separate, the chime sounds from the large item, which you plug into an outlet.The description used the term ""doorbell"" several times.It seems passable for its intended use, though the chine setup is somewhat complex, you use ""jumpers"" like you'd find on computer hardware to change settings. The volume adjusts well and the chine tone is clear"
3,"It works, but the battery seems not last very long","It works as I expected, but the sensor's battery seems doesn't last very long. After two days of a brand new installation, it failed to work until I replaced a new sensor battery. So I guess I will need to prepare some more sensor batteries to keep it working."
4,Remote Door Chime for Businesses,"This unit works well once you change the frequency from that which comes factory set. If you leave it like the factory sets it you get quite a few false rings possibly from aberrant signals in the area. Also, the battery in the remote unit does not insert solidly so you have to be really quick to get the door back on it. Finally, I don't believe you can set it so that it only has one chime for the entry. Your choices are either Westminster or ding-dong. I'd prefer a single ding (or dong). Otherwise, it is a very nice unit. I'd recommend it. Amazon's return is also very hassle-free as I had to replace the first unit I received. They sent out a return label and a new unit. Very efficient."
1,not a very good series,"The Sheridan series is pretty weak. V.A. Stuart is no Bernard Cornwell. The author knows her history well enough, but the main character isn't very interesting, nor does he really do anything interesting, despite being involved in the Crimean War and the Indian Mutiny. On the whole, I was glad I got these from the library rather than buying them."
3,Several Areas of Omission,"Alot of material in this book. As a new user of Photoshop I followed several of the step by step explanations only to find there were some steps missing in going from A to B, and incorrect reference to Figures that were used for reference (particularly in Chapter 9). I found this very annoying. When you pick up on the errors the authors attempt at humor then really falls short. Maybe this is a good overall book on a very complex piece of software but I had nothing else to compare it to. I hope there is something better out there or I believe many beginners will give up on Photoshop. I gave up on this book. Again, because of some step omissions the beginner may find himself scratching his head as to what to do. I had to play with the images to find out it wasn't my lack of understanding but poor editing of examples."
2,"Inexpensive, but photo quality sometimes suffers","This is just a basic UV filter, and is usually pretty useful, but occasionally creates serious problems. I've noticed that I get blue/green noise on my images in back-lit or bright photographs. This is a serious problem, and isn't always noticeable in the viewfinder. It's no fun to get home and find out that some of your favorite compositions look like crap.I'm usingNikon D90 12.3MP Digital SLR Camera (Body Only)with aNikon 50mm f/1.8D AF Nikkor Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras, which both function beautifully, so the filter is definitely the problem.If you can't afford a better filter, go with this one. Be ready to take it off when you are outside though."
2,Beware Internal Reflection,I bought this filter to protect my Olympus Zuiko Portrait Prime Lens. Big Cons: This filter causes internal reflection at night. I have used Hoya filters in the same price range and they did not cause internal reflection. Pros: The metal frame does feel very sturdy. Overall I do not recommend it.
3,Poorly factory packed and filthy,"What do you expect from a new UV filter? That it is ""new"", clean, well factory packed, in good condition, right?I ordered a couple of Tiffen filters to protect my lenses. They came in a nice plastic case. Upon opening the case I foundthe bare filter inside, bouncing all over the case. Not even a simple plastic bag or wraping to protect it from the harsh platic enclosure. A couple if nicks in the ring, another one in the filter itself (unable to remove). I spent 10 minutes patiently cleaning each one of them. If I lived in the US, I would have returned them immediately. I will have to replace the damaged one at my expense."
3,It's Ok. But a must to have....,It's like you should have been wearing your rain coat when it's raining. Will you should have a Lens Protector need i say more.I Will be doing bizz again with this vender.....
5,Perfect fit.,"This filter is reasonably priced, fits the lens perfectly, and is great protection for a truly expensive lens that needs protection. The item arrived in good time a day or so before I was going off on a winter vacation and did not want to worry about a heretofore-unprotected lens. I would recommend this seller again without hesitation."
2,Crap,"What a waste of a few bucks. I knew I bought an inexpensive filter but please, couldn't you just run a marker around the cut edges of the glass? The edges looked cheap and reflective. Don't make the same mistake, mine is aging in a drawer."
2,not a good filter,"I bought this last year for $13.65 (omg! it's $7.50 now! urgh!) with my Tamron 28-75mm.I used this lens to take portraits and I notice the images are not sharp at all when I zoomed in.I later switched to my Canon 70-200mm (I know it's different quality compare to the Tamron) with the B+W filter, and it was super sharp.Even if the shutter was fast and the light was even, 9 out of 10 images still came out blurry. It bugged me so much to do a comparison test with and without the filter.without the filter, my images were so much sharper.As long as you don't zoom in, it's fine.So, you really get what you paid for. IF you want to protect your lens and not really care about sharpness, go ahead to get this thingy. But, if you care about the sharpness of your photo, stay away. Might as well donate the $7.50 to SPCA or whatever charity you support."
3,Good buy,"A UV or 1A filter will protect your valuable front element of your lens. The filter needs to be optically clear with no imperfections that can affect your photo. This Tiffen works well. altho I have to agree I cannot see the minor imperfections that could be there. You can spend much much more, I use it on a Canon 16-35 L and cannot see any vignetting. I recommend it."
1,tiffen UV filter,"While my older 52mm filters would screw into the front of my new Canon XS30IS, I found that the 52mm Tiffen would not. I was unsure if the threads were different, or incorrect. Looking on the Amazon site I found another seller offering a 58mm filter/holder and cap kit for the same camera. I'm unsure if this is a better option or if I just need a different 52mm filter. I also wonder if a UV filter is really needed, or I should use just a clear filter on a digital camera?"
1,Fragile filter,"It appears that the glass of which the filter was made was not tempered by the way it broke when it was subjected to a gentle tap. If the Tiffen process does not call for tempering the glass then it has a defficient process for a product to be used as a protection filter. Fortunaely it do not cause damge to the lens it was intentended to protect. Not have had that happening to me in fifty years of buying UV/Protection filters for seven cameras beginning from a Leica 3G, bought 2nd hand in 1950."
2,Needs anti glare,"This filter does not have anti glare so anytime you take a picture with a little more light around, the ""green ghosts"" will appear. I noticed it doesn't even have to be facing the light... So outdoors with this filter is impossible.The two stars it's because it's strong and looks like a good protection, but no use if it ruins your pictures. Sending back for a refund."
3,Great Value UV Filter,"There's no coating on these Tiffen UV filters so you may get lens-flare, internal reflections, etc. It does do a good job at protecting the front element, though."
4,Tiffen Filter,It's a cheap investment in helping protect my lens from fingerprints and dust. Because it is not coated its easier to clean and I won't worry about just wiping it with my shirt. The material used is fine but not well made compared to Hoya and B+W. The only drawback is I get ghosting when I shoot dim-indoor shots and if there's a light source. Beacuse or the price I highly recommend this product.
3,As expected for Tiffen,Provides good protection for your glass. You get what you pay for quality-wise. I always make sure to put a filter on my lens the moment I get it and the Tiffen does it's job.
1,disappointed,I am disappointed with the service. The filter came to me with amount of dust on both sides.
2,You get what you pay for,"I was impressed by the great reviews everyone leaves this UV filter on Amazon, so I tried it. However, after a few light days of use, the glass element became lose. While it doesn't appear that many people have had this problem, I suspect it has to do with overall quality control at Tiffen. If you are going to put a piece of glass in between your photographed object and your expensive lens glass, spend a little money and get something good. The best thing you can get is something that you don't notice.That said, if you're budget conscious, use a kit lens/equivalent, and don't mind having to possibly send one of these backs for a replacement that works - this is probably a good filter for you."
5,Must have for all your lenses!,I get at least a UV filter for all my lenses. That's the cheapest insurance you can get for you lense. Protect it from possible scratches and banging against objects. Haven't really seen a major difference between the brand filter and the Tiffen filter. I would just go with the cheapest filter to be found for you lens.
2,causes lens flare,haD TO TAKE IT OFF AS THE LENS FLARE WAS RIDICULOUS...I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT ...pay a little more get something better
3,Filter for GF1,"Bought this for the GF1 pancake lens. Works great protecting the lens. Didn't need to keep taking the lens cap on and off. However, as others mentioned, reflection from night time lights can ruin some shots."
3,"OK, but wrong size.","The filter was fine, but Amazon was selling it with the Fujifilm FiePix HS10 camera which takes 58mm accessories NOT 46mm. I had to return it."
3,Good lens protector,"I use it as a protector for the lens itself. It fits fine and takes a snap-on cap securely. If I wanted more versatility, I would order the 3-filter pack, which I have for other lenses."
4,Got this to protect my Canon VIXIA HF100...,"4 stars only because it took me around 5 mins to slowly screw this on the camcorder. It can be shifted or uneven when you put it on easily. So, I have to take it off and re-screw on a few times until I get it right in the groves. The camcorder video comes out great.I tested with it on and off, and I can not tell its there when I watch the video in HD.GL and enjoy."
3,OK if there are no point light sources,"I recently purchased this filter as a lens guard. I tried taking a picture of our family's Christmas tree. The picture was a mess of smally, blurry light spots. I'm not sure on the exact number, but it looked like about 2 to 3 blurry lights for each light that was actually on the tree. The ""ghost"" lights certainly ruined the picture.The other pictures I took with the lens all turned out fine (no noticeable effects). My guess is that the filter only has problems with point light sources. If I could do it over again, I would have spent an extra $10 to get a filter without this problem."
5,Added protection for my lenses at tiny cost,I have purchased this filter for both of my lenses (Canon 50mm f/1.4 & 28mm 1.8). It seems to be high quality and I don't notice any difference when shooting. The added protection for my lenses is more than worth the incredibly low cost.
4,Happy - as expected,"Seller was prompt and item arrived without any problems and as described. I use it primarily to protect my 50mm Canon lens, and am happy with it so far."
2,Don't bother with this if you are using the 50mm f/1.8 lens to shoot portraits,"This is a cheap UV filter and if you are only using the 50mm f/1.8 lens to shoot indoor portraits, don't bother with this."
3,cheap filter with dusty package,"it shipped with a very dusty plastic case, on which the tags were blurred. the filter looks ok with the cheap price. anyway, not as good as the items in local store."
2,Plastic Threading comes off,"I bought this because it was cheap. I kept it on the camera all times. When I screwed in a cheap SEIKOS 82mm polarizing filter, it stayed there. The polarizing filter keep turning, but won't come off the TIFFEN UV filter. I had to break the cheap Polarizing filter to find out the thread on the TIFFEN filter was made of plastic and it simply ground away when the SEIKOS filter turned.Now I have to buy both filters new. I am buying a SIGMA glass filter with antiglare coating. Don't buy this cheap filter. spend extra money and get a good brand like SIGMA or CANON."
5,Very good filter,"I bought the Pentax DA 50-300mm lens and at the time Amazon was running a deal of getting a free Tiffen UV filter with it. Normally I'd go out a get a hight end filter but this was free so I went for it. It's been a very good filter, have not noticed any significant difference between it and my much pricier Hoya. It has definitely exceeded my expectations. I'd recommend this filter to anyone looking for a good quality inexpensive filter."
1,re-packaged product,Product came in used condition. Discoloration on the product surface. The glass surface of the filter had smudges and fingerprints on it. Sent a e-mail to adorama which responded they would send me a return label. Amazon responded that they wouldn't refund until the product is returned. All this trouble for a $10 filter. Don't by from Adorama. If you read other reviews on them they are hit and miss. The miss is how they turn a profit. Wonder why Amazon allows these type of vendor to sell through them.
5,Filter,"Anyone that actually takes photographs knows that you should protect your lens, and tiffen filters do a great job, such as this one."
4,Great Product for the price...,I always use filter to protect my lens from scratches and dust etc. Cheaper to replace scratched filter compared to replacing the lens. Decent product for the price.
2,"""Good Enough""","The lens of this filter is able to rotate freely within the metal ring; none of my other, more professional filters do that, so it projects a vibe of bad worksmanship. I bought this filter only to go on the kit lens that came with my camera, and so I didn't want to spend a lot. This filter is good enough to be used on the kit lens, but I'd get something higher quality for any other lens."
3,I guess it works.,"This filter does work when it comes to UV but that's only during the daytime. When it comes down to shooting pictures around Vegas at night though, there's all sorts of reflections and light spots in all the pictures, My guess is because it's not coated very well, so unless you take the filter off, many of the pictures wont turn out as good as they could be. The filter still provides the lens some protection though, so it stays on my lens, I just have to be cautious when shooting at night, which I wish I didn't have to do."
1,Terrible Ghosting,"Encountered some serious ghosting issues with the UV filter when taking pictures that included a light source. Honestly I was taken back by the reviews here and should have known that a $6 piece of glass would perform sub-optimally. I immediately took this off my 50mm lens. Would I recommend this? Not in am million years. At $6 I won't be returning it, the hassle of shipping for $6 just isn't worth it."
1,the filters are not new,"it buys the filters 58mm UV and polarizer , and for my surprise they arrived both with a ray in the glass! , they are of VERY BAD QUALITY, costs much to lompiar them, I have others of smaller quality and the polvopor almost does not stick they, I do not recommend them are very bad and above they came failed"
1,Poor construction quality,The glass is very loose inside the frame. It feels as though it might come apart at any time. The glass definitely rattles about inside the frame with any movement of the camera.
1,Don't buy this for your L lens!,"People- please, think! If you're spending over $1000 on a precision piece of optics, why would you put an cheap window pane in front of it? It sucks that filters cost a bit of money, but seriously, you need to get something that's at least multicoated, and preferably B&W or Heliopan or some other good brand. For a $200 lens, this is fine. But it breaks my heart to see this ""bundled"" with an $1100 L lens."
4,Does what it's supposed to,"I bought this filter to put on the front of the 18-70 DX lens on my Nikon D50. It works well and protects the front element of the lens from dust, dirt, fingerprints and whatnot.It seems to cause a little vignetting (slightly darkened corners) at extreme wide angles (~18mm) -- but from what I've seen so far it isn't terribly noticeable, 'specially for the price."
5,It does it is supposed to do - protecting expensive lenses,"I bought Canon TI3 a 2 months ago. Bought a case with it. I will review the case in the other review. The problem for the case is, it has a handle on top of case cover, which is only secured by buckling the 2 traps.Here is the story cut short. In the middle of my shooting process, I took a brief rest and put back the camera back in case. Since I will pick it up a few moments later, I didn't buckle the straps for the cover. My wife tried to move it by the handle on cover. Guess what?The whole case is flipped and the camera dumped on the ground.Fortunately the only broken part is the protector."
3,Ya get what ya pays for,Cheap but doesn't seem all that durable and picks up glare easily. Seemed to get nicked and scratched a bit too easily as well.
2,not great,I bought this to use with my Canon 50mm 1.4 prime lens. I was really surprised by how much light is reflected into the frame. Tried to take a few shots of the recent lunar eclipse and they were terrible. Much better when I removed the filter. I have other UV filters (Hoya) and did not realize there could be such a difference. Pay more and get something else.
5,Hope it does what it's supposed to,"I purchased this filter for one reason which is to protect my lens. Difficult as it is to rate the filter simply based on that factor, I'd say it appears that it'll help keep my lens clean, scratch-free, and hopefully protect it if a mishap occurs! As everyone is saying, better to break the filter than your costly lenses.As for the effects it has on photo quality, I've read some other reviews that it affects photos in low light/night shots. I'm just a beginner so maybe it'll be helpful to look into that via other reviews."
1,You get what you pay for.,"I suppose it does the job, but it's very cheaply made...the glass isnt glued or set into the metal, so it moves around makes an annoying noise everytime you move the camera."
1,"cheated by seller, this seller is awful....",I purchased this filter along with universal car charger and I received shipment today. When I opened Tiffen filter there is no UV filter in it. I got empty box there is no filter inside the box. This seller is awful I am never going to buy from this seller again.
3,"For the price, it is what it is.","Bought for under $20 to put on my Canon 16-35mm lens. Fits snug. Metal ring. The filter was dusty out of the package. There were slight splotches on the glass itself in some places, as if the coating were coming off. I've not seen that on other filters from Tiffen, but the pictures I took so far have no inconsistencies that I can tell. I wasn't expecting much for a $20 filter, just something to weather seal my lens, and I'm not disappointed. For the price I can't complain; it is what it is."
1,Low quality filter,"I bought 3 of these to protect the lenses for a new camera purchase. I get reflections (shown as a double or ghost image) off of them in conditions where a bright object is present. Things like the moon, or the sun reflecting on water will create a second ghost image of the bright object. Also, on 2 of the 3 filters, the glass is loose in the ring.I take some responsibility here as I basically thought that a uv filter was uv filter, as I had never had trouble with one before.Bottom line is that these filters were a waste of money for me. Right now, they are just screw on lens caps..."
4,Good basic protection,I used these for years and was completely satisfied. If this is what your budget allows then it's a very good choice.
1,You get what you pay for.,"Granted that this filter is as much as a beer at a cheap bar, but ultimately it is not fit to put on any lens. I got a few of them in different sizes for my lenses because I was trying to save money. I put the filters on and they were both flaring like crazy, ruining every shot. I had to take them off to be able to shoot. I would suggest that you spend the 30-50 dollars that a decent Hoya or B+W filter costs and make sure you get multicoated filters."
4,Great bargain for a UV filter,"A good, cheap UV filter for protecting lenses. I bought this for my Nikon 18-200mm lens. It can often introduce flares into your images when shooting towards sunlight or strong light sources so beware. To reduce that effect, buy a multi coated filter."
5,Tiffen Fan for LIFE,I have taken some awesome pictures with this...My outdoor action shots are soooo good that people are offering me more money than what I'm asking for them...Thanks Tiffen for protecting my SIGMA 24-70 F/2.8 82mm lens and providing another good product for me to bragg on.
5,Great filter,Fits perfect on our canon lenses. Fits kit 18-55 and 70-300 lenses. Ships in hard protective case with foam inside.
3,lens flare a problem,Great for overall protection of your lenses - but not multi-coated glass so pretty significant problem with ghosting and lens flare when shooting towards a light.
2,Cheap. Get somethign better for $10 more.,"This is cheap gear. The only things I can say it does as expected are 1) it fits, and 2) it will protect your lens's front element...mostly.The glass fits the ring poorly and shifts, letting dust get to your lens, thus requiring you to clean your lens's front element, which presents the opportunity to damage it that you were trying to avoid by installing this ""protective"" filter.The optics are questionable, as other point out.If you're broke, and just want to keep fingers off your lens, sure. Otherwise, get anything better, like a Hoya, or splurge and get a B+W."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this basically as a dust protector, so I didn't expect much. However, I was seriously upset to find that pictures are ruined by the filter because of distortions and lines."
1,Terrible in Night,Please do not buy this filter. It gives terrible flare to the photograph in the night. Works good in the day time. Try hoya. Just 10 dollar more than this item.
1,"Get a multi-coated filter, this one causes ghosts","I also had trouble with ""ghosts"" - basically glare in photos taken with this filter. I never had that problem with other multi-coated products. I bought this filter for protection and to leave on all the time. It ruined most of the photos of my sister's wedding because there were light sources from every angle (flashes, indoor lights, etc). It was a huge disappointment. Actually you can see a very mild example of this in one of the submitted sample photos of a sunset by Kaushik Ghose ""kghose"". This is a mild form, mine were much worse. Unfortunately this lens filter is now worthless to me. So save your $10 and buy something that will actually work."
4,good for the price,This really simple to put on your lens and keep the glass clean also it is really good at protecting your lens from breaking. It claims to keep UV out of your lens but I think it makes easier.
3,Worth the Price,"I'm no professional, but the previous filter I bought seemed like a higher quality than this one. But, if you're looking for something to just protect your lens, especially against those ""little kid sticky fingers"", then this will work and it's very cheap."
4,Very good lens protection,Very good protection. I got this before a trip to Mexico and it protected my new Nikon lenses very well.
5,Good deal,It's a good deal. I use this as a lens protector and it works pretty well. Also the UV filter also makes the picture with better colors
4,Does the job at a great price,"I got this UV filter to use with my Nikon D40. There isn't much to it to make it malfunction - it's a piece of glass mounted on a 52mm-threaded ring.If I look at the filter from an angle, I can see a strange pattern of sorts on the glass, but this doesn't seem to affect my photos.Having the filter means I can wipe off fingerprints without fear of waering down the coatings on the front element of the lens, and it's also cheap insurance for small dings.Thanks Amazon for the great price ($6.99) and fast shipping (placed order Sunday; order was placed on Sunday, wasn't shipped until Friday, but arrived on Saturday)."
5,revision de filtro,Este filtro es bastante bueno y protegue el lente de mi cámara. No hay aberración cromática ni cambios sustanciales en la imagen . Es tonto tener que dar tanta explicación por un filtro. sirve o no.
4,Fair offer,I've bought this filter as part of the Amazon offer together with one camera and one lens - and I am fully satisfied; filter does it's job and helps to protect my lenses from dust and fingertios additionaly.
1,have no idea if it is good or not,I have no idea if this is a good UV protector or not since when i bought my camera from Amazon it recommended I purchase this as well but it doesn't fit the lens that came with my camera... teach me to assume Amazon recommends stuff that would be useful.
2,Will ruin some pictures,"This is not a multi coated filter. Using this on your lens makes the picture quality come down by 2 notches.If any direct sunlight hits the glass (even if the sun is not withing the picture frame), the whole picture appears washed out. I only bought this because I got this free with my lens purchase. I always buy the sigma multicoated filters for my lenses. They are truely multi coated and reflect a dim green just like the expensive camera lenses. Unfortunately tiffen does not make any true multi coated lenses."
5,"Protects lens, does not reduce/improve photo quality","UV protection appears minimal--I did take photographs at a brightly sunlit harbor with and without the Tiffen 58mm filter, and could not notice anything conspicuously different. However, my take is that the main purpose of UV filters is to protect the lens from getting dirty or getting damaged, and I appreciate not getting dust and particulates on my lenses."
5,A must for every lens,This inexpensive UV filter is a cheap insurance policy for the optics of your lens. I carry a couple spares in my camera bag.
3,A little loose,"I've had good luck with tiffen filters. The 58mm is one of their cheaper ones and the quality isn't great. The glass rattles in the frame, but once I had screwed it onto the lens tightly (i mean really tightly) then the rattling stopped. It's just for protection, and I'll probably scratch it soon and replace it, so if you're like me it's fine but if you're looking for something better, pay more!"
4,Works for me,"I put this Filter on my Sigma 18-250mm Macro Lens and it works just fine. The Lens Hook that came with the Sigma works with this too. However the other Hood I have does NOT work with this filter, it does not line up right and show up in some wide angle shots. I don't know if its the filter or the hood, but since the factory hood works, I'll be sending the extra hood back and keeping the filter."
5,What a deal.,Great deal on a tiffen filter. Pictures come out sharp with no glare. A great way to protect your expensive lens.
2,Don't use with a 50mm,"While this basic filter, does physically protect your lens for cheap... I warn you that when I put it on my 50mm f/1.4, *every* picture (99% use in low light) that contained a light source had light flashes/reflections - which completely went away when I removed this filter.I haven't tried with a coated filter yet, but I don't usually shoot in harsh conditions (ie. sandy, misty, etc...), I will likely leave a filter off my 50mm lens when shooting.UPDATE: it got annoying screwing the filter on/off, so now it just sits in my bag. I can only imagine using it in adverse conditions (windy, mistly, etc...) - for now will use a lens hood."
2,Loose filter lens,"When I got this for my wife's new Panasonic FZ35 last year, it was slightly loose in it's housing and then today (Christmas 2011) it completely unseated within the circular frame and the camera kept trying to focus in on it rather than the intended subject.Threw it away and just ordered the Hoya in hopes of a better filter (at double the cost)."
5,Wanda Gag Fairy Take Collection,"This book had wonderful reviews, so I felt luck to find this old copy. They seem perfect for reading- not too long, not too short, not too scary, but with enough of the original Grimm flavor that it is a little scary in places- which I consider to be a good thing."
4,Great romantic comedy.,"This was a fun James Garner at his romantic comedy best. I rank it #2 in that category. Natalie Wood is great oposite Garner. This is a comedy that uses some slapstick and mis-direction and coincidence to create the friction that make it fun.I still prefer the Wheeler Dealers for sheer fun, but overall CC is a better movie, with a more interesting plot and co-star."
5,Buy it before it vanishes forever!,"Howard Waldrop's latest collection of ""alternate reality"" SF defies all convention. His ""what if the Nazis won WWII"" story brings Shemp Howard, Zero Mostel, Peter Lorre and Brecht's widow together in an absurdist play about a journey to Mars, the Red planet. Fats Waller and Tom Wolfe hang out on a dirigible. Three Mexican luchadors fight off ancient Aztec gods. That's just the beginning. Each story also has an afterword which also solves the riddle of the alternate reality and gives an insight into Waldrop's writing process. Waldrop's books never hang around the stores for long (he has about $6 in his bank account) and his stuff can be shelved under Science Fiction, Literature or anything else. I found my copy under Hunting/Fishing. Buy it on-line before it disappears!"
5,Don't know why,"Either this film is brilliant or it is horribly bad. I don't know, but I do know that I was mesmerized as I watched it, and it stayed on my mind, even after repeated viewings. This is cinema.Intentionally or not, it's structured like a Qur'anic Ruku, which is rare in modern literature."
1,How is this worthy of being in the Criterion Collection,"If there was a deep meaning in this film, then I missed it entirely. After the first ten minutes of driving and talking I was bored. And then I got to sit through another hour of it before anything different happened. Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge fan of independent film and artsy originality. This simply had no depth. For a film that was apparently (from what I could tell) a character study of a man that is being slowly talked out of killing himself, it never once achieved any sort of intensity for me. I was so bored by the end of the film that by the time we saw the rough ""home-video"" style footage of the cast bumming around, I actually found myself laughing hysterically at the fact that I managed to sit through it. And then I laughed even harder when I ...found that it had been released by the Criterion Collection, and that it had an average review of 4 stars.What did I miss?"
2,This film is disappointing and overrated.,"After reading the critical reviews by the professionals on this movie, I expected far more than it delivered. It took far too long just to figure out what the main character was up to (help in his suicide attempt). Living in the SF Bay area, it came across at first as a homosexual pickup. The director spent far too much time filming a dirt road in barren hills both from inside and outside the car. When the main character found somebody to help him, the other man was just suddenly there and we never saw an introductory encounter. And then, at the end, the story suddenly became the filming of the same story. Why? All in all, it was underwhelming and pretentious and certainly filmed cheaply. The emperor has no clothes!"
1,Why bother?!? Save your money for something with substan,This has to be the most boring movies I've ever seen in my life. There happen to be some excellent films coming out of the Middle East. This is NOT one of them. Save your money and wait till something worthwhile is actually released on DVD.If your looking for a film 'masterpiece' - look elsewhere - you're not going to find it here!
4,please change the title. it's a typo.,"withness? WITNESS!!Music itself is no doubt good.but when i try to search for this album, this doesn't appear due to the typo.amazon, please correct the title."
1,Not my expectation,"As a loyal Sophie Kinsella (Shopaholic series) fan, I anticipated another fun read under her real name, Madeleine Wickham. However, the author's writing style differs greatly between names, and I was somewhat dissapointed with this book."
2,just okay,"Although I adore this author, I prefer her much more as Sophie Kinsella. When she writes as Madeleine Wickham she lacks the wit and humor that won me over. The characters in this book are not particularly likable and share very different values than I do. Subjects like infidelity, teenage sex and teenage substance abuse are taken very lightly and almost passed off as nothing. The ending seemed a little too picture perfect for the ""realness"" and meatiness of the rest of the book and basically left me no better and no worse for having read the book."
1,Surprisingly Boring,"I am a HUGE fan of the Shopaholic series so I eagerly embraced this series of books by Madeleine Wickham. That being said, I felt as though the characters were stiff and I found I couldn't relate to them. Two families find themselves sharing a villa for vacation, and unbeknownst to the rest of the family one wife and the other husband used to be lovers. Akward? To say the least! However I just was even interested enough in the situation and story to even finish the book which is highly unusual for me. The story just seemed to drag from one angry depressing moment to the next. I think I'll just stick to the Shopaholic series and leave Madeline Wickham books alone."
3,Sleeping Arrangements,"The nice thing about this author is you know you are never going to get something BAD, just occasionally one that is less good than the others. That is how I felt about this one - it was fun but really light and really fluffy. Mind candy. Not as deeply drawn or believable as some of her other work but still fun."
1,Not up to Sophie's standards,"I was a little leary of reading this book after reading the reviews but I thought I would give it a try. I ended up skimming the book just to get through it. The plot was awful, the characters did not endear them to you, and it was a waste of my time. I love Sophie Kinsella's books so I am sad that she writes such junk under another name."
5,Hillarious.,"As always, Madeleine Wickham (Sophie Kinsella) has an amazing sense of humour and timing in her books. I enjoyed it from front to back."
1,Terrible movie!,"This is one of the worst movies I've watched (it was amatuerish at best). The video teasers (showing Lucy's breast's almost falling out while bending over the kitchen counter)says 'everything' bad about this movie. When THAT is the highlight a viewer should be smart enough to know better than to buy it (However, I WASN'T). You were warned, this movie, if you are ONLY a Lucy Lawless FAN is at best worth a download, not even a rental). I know one man's treasure is another man's trash regarding value and opinions, but I cannot imagine how this movie got 4 stars (the reason I purchased it). I've seen other complaints about star ratings on Amazon, too. I've got a feeling that these ratings are coming from people tied in (royalty payments, etc.)in part. This isn't the only movie I've bought using the recommended 'star rating'. Very, very disappointing (the movie and the decision in my purchasing of it)."
5,New Experiences,"I subscribe to the Weight Watchers magazine. I love the personal stories about weight loss. It is encouraging to me because I am trying to make ""eating right"" a way of life. I try not to look at it as a diet. I am now eating healther than I have ever eaten in my entire life and I feel great doing it. I LOVE IT! The recipes and coupons are excellent. It is a wonderful magazine. I would recommend it to everyone."
4,Thumbs up from a personal trainer,I keep up with what's going on with the fitness and weightloss industry but I did not really pay too much mind to WW till an old client brought it up. I bought it and it is so motivational that I recommend it to my clients because of the success stories. It really helps to know that people all over the country are attaining their weightloss goals. I have now start to add success stories to my website at(...) just to help my customers get motivated. The WW also have other great benefits if you have your mind set on loosing weight it's a good resource to pick up.
1,Can't review a magazine that won't get here until 7 months after it is ordered!,Can't wait to see it but was sadly disappointed when my sister-in-law told me that the magazine she ordered on May 1st for my birthday in May would now become my Christmas present. Amazon just sent her a note now in September saying that the order has shipped and I will receive it in 10 weeks. I think this reveiw belongs here if you are thinking of buying this as a gift as it may not be the way to go.
1,Irregular Arrivals,"This past year, the Weight Watchers magazines I received had many good ideas; unfortunately, I have received only 2 issues and I have now received notice that I have only one more issue for my year's subscription. Essentially that means that I was ""shorted"" 3 issues during the year. Contacting the publisher of the magazine has NOT resulted in any responses or changes in issue delivery. Receiving special introductory rates from Amazon is only a ""good deal"" if the magazines actually arrive! I suppose Amazon has nothing to do with such issues, but perhaps some publishing companies should be dropped or at least warned!"
4,I'm Pleased,As a member of WW Online I find this magazine to be a wonderful supplement to the information online. I especially like having the recipes on hand.
1,I give this book a one,I don't think this book is that good because it didn't really grab me as a reader and I didn't really enjoy It like some other b books I've read
4,Great :),"I was a little sad to find there were no illustrations in this book. When I was READING it, it never occurred to me, but when I downloaded ""Through the Looking Glass"" and found there were pics in it, it was a bit annoying.However, that being said, this is just gorgeous children's literature. I can't believe I waited so long to read it! I should have read this book as a little girl, when the magic would have been so much more real. I love the almost stream-of-consciousness feel to the words, and of course the extremely imaginative scenes. I think every child should have a copy of this book and the next Alice adventure!"
3,"Good actors, irritating adaption","I thought for sure the BBC would get Alice in Wonderland right and to some degree they have. The actors all do their parts very well and overall this CD is enjoyable. It will be maddening though to Alice fans who expect the script to follow the book. I don't understand why it was thought necessary to change the plot line almost at whim and then insert ""The Walrus and the Carpenter"" (from Through the Looking Glass). What's wrong with the way Carroll wrote the book? His logic is far superior to this adaption. I felt frustrated throughout when incidents or characters were skipped, but then turned up later in the story. Surely the BBC could have done better with one of Great Britain's classics!"
2,blah blah blah,i though this would be a great book turns out its just long and boring if you can wait three hours go ahead
5,A Truly Great Book,A wonderful tale with exquisite artwork from the original masters. The book is durable and easy to read for many ages. I thoroughly enjoyed the way this particular version of the story with the original images presented itself and made the story come alive for me.
1,"The movies are much, much better","This book is the reason I've sworn off ever reading ""classics"" -- they're wordy and boring. This book feels like Carroll's attempt to ""astonish"" 19th-century adolescent girls. Wow! yet another impossible situation! Stick with Disney's & Depp's movie versions -- they're much more fleshed out."
4,"Entertaining, easy and relaxed read","This is perhaps a read best saved for a lazy Sunday. It is quick, easy and requires relatively no thought. There are some tricky, archaic words but the Kindle's dictionary clears those right up. A little bit ""trippy"" at times, but this book is entertaining if nothing else. It is well written from the readers point of view."
3,Classic children's tale,Nice easy read but wonderland is a very strange place. I don't see how children would enjoy this book. However I did enjoy the ending.
4,Very British,It's the original Alice in Wonderland. Somethings maybe hard for an American child to understand and the parent may have to figure it out for him or her.
3,Confusing at times,It is a little like the movie. This version can get to be where you don't know what's happening in the book.
3,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,A Classic children's story. It was fun. If you've seen the Disney cartoon it follows the book pretty much verbatim.
5,"Always wanted this, now on kindle","I've always wanted this book, and the kindle version is perfect. The book was formatted perfectly for kindle so adjusting the font was easy. I only wish it had pictures throughout."
5,Great Book,This is a great book to read to children. Imagination is never a useless quality. Never grow up. It's a trap.
4,I give this four stars because I'm not finished yet.,"I in my life don't remember reading or seeing an Alice In Wonderland movie; not a cartoon or actual person one. If anything I remember seeing pieces of a cartoon if you're lucky and so when I downloaded this book, I didn't expect to like it. As to be honest, I have an odd taste in books, I thought Alice was not my thing. But I was sucked in from the first sentence. I give this book four stars right now as I am still reading it and also because it's a bit confusing at times and repeats itself a tiny bit here and there, nothing major."
1,a real pain,"I ordered this book twice and both times received the wrong book. The first time, Amazon refunded me and sent me a link to re-order. The second time, it was still the wrong book. Both times they were Alice in Wonderland but not even close to the one pictured. Also, both times were books in horrible condition. I wish I had the one pictured but I finally gave up."
2,Not your animated Alice.,"Having grown up with the classic Disney tale and the Through the Looking Glass television special (which ran once a year, much like the Wizard of Oz, a two-night special!), it was difficult for me to fully appreciate the original tale. I was also sad to see none of the characters continue from Wonderland to Looking Glass, but suppose they are really two different locations and thus would have different characters."
3,A poke in the eyes!,"Another great story and incomplete book. The original is excellent, but this version's been maimed. I was hoping for some nice pictures for the kindle."
4,Alice in wonderlans,It was so great I couldn't stop reading it it is a 10 star raiting.I loved it so much you should read it I think u would love it
2,Ehh..,It was kind of hard to understand in the middle and end but all around a good read good for middle schoolers
3,Curious Things,"The story line contains many symbols and moral in a rather unfashionable display. However, it is a wonderful novel to read with a child's point of view through the whole adventure in a land of wonder."
2,My day with Alice,I was forced to read this book by my mother and I had to read it in 1 day. I really didn't enjoy it much but it was very well written and should be considered as a highly honored classic novel.
3,incomplete,"While I have always loved Alice's Adventures, I did NOT love this edition. It had none of the pictures or poetry. I guess you have to pay the dollar ninety-nine to see the complete edition... which I have done."
3,Under the Lens,A Classic is a classic a classic. The detailed notes are a delight and enhances readability. However the title did not mention if its an abridged version or a complete version.
3,It was ok,this book was very wierd and interesting. with its caracters and settings. this book makes you want to go down into a hole and meet a rabbit and the mad hatter. it also takes you in to its world...
3,Good,I thought this book was good. I grew up with the movie and have only recently read the book. I would say this is a good read for just about anyone who is looking for a short and entertaining book.
1,DISSAPPOINTED,i really felt let down by this book. For once in my life i believe the movie adaptation was better than the book. i felt it was dull and boring. Thankfullt i didnt waste any money as it is free.
2,Nonsense,"I never read this book as a kid. My familiarity with the story stems mainly from the Disney adaptation and general knowledge. The Kindle version of the book was free, it was pretty short, and I decided I'd give it a shot.I'm sorry I bothered.This book is definitely *not* my cup of tea. I enjoyed the wikipedia entry about the book more than the book itself. It noted that the book is classified as ""nonsense literature,"" and I cannot agree more. The book is utter nonsense. I just could not get into the spirit of the writing at all.If you love this book, more power to you. I'll stick with the film adaptations. And I won't be reading ""Through The Looking Glass."""
2,Review,It was weird but overall a decent book. Different style of writing. Kept running the Disney version through my head.
2,Try again.,I'm sorry but I got the feeling that this book was a rip-off of Ann B. Ross's Miss Julia stories. Both Esmerelda and Miss Julia are southern matrons with the conviction that they know what is best for all they meet. Both are basically good at heart but Esmerelda comes out on the short end of any comparison I can think of with Miss Julia. I can usually trust a consensus of Amazon reviews but this time I was mistaken.
4,Bread n butter,"Ms. Graham writes a simple, easy to read tale. Her main character is someone you may know (even though she's fictitious!) The book is what I call ""Bread & Butter"" reading: it has all the elements of a good story. leaving you contented & full even though it isn't fancy. The characters are real, with endearing personalities and faults of their own. The town is small, making us long for such a place to call home. There is faith, love, eating and fellowship in the book which confronts ugly subjects the way Christians should confront them. This book ( and her others) is moving, funny and satisfying. You will want to read them all. And you'll wish you lived next door to Ms. Esmeralda!"
4,Review of a review from an Innocent ex-TX Death Row Inmate,"I read the review by the jealous, disgruntled current Texas Death Row inmate. There are no computers on death row. I question the lacky and co-conspirator working on his behalf. I knew Leslie Gosch while I was an innocent member of death row. Though I cannot speak of his innocence or guilt, what I can say is that Leslie never bothered anyone. I cannot fathom what he did to evoke such hatred and jealously from one of his peers. This is a good book into the horrors of the worst death row in America. Ignore the vindictive ramblings of this death row inmate who needs to remove the mote from his own eye before castigating another. Great job, Ms. Elder."
3,"Short, but effective.",Life on a deserted tropical island doesn't have to be so bad. Especially when you have a mermaid (topless supermodel Tracy Millhollon) to keep you company!
4,To Robert Graves,"Muse has a pop sensibility combined with the earthy and dark tones of which you think are reminiscent of early Radiohead (let's not forget about Pablo Honey). But honestly, do you realize the folly in saying that Muse does Radiohead better than Radiohead? You fool, Radiohead is the only one who can ""do"" Radiohead. Furthermore, this guy sounds nothing like Thom Yorke. The inflection in his voice, the breathy falsetto, the quivering vibrato is nothing more than an exact replica of JEFF BUCKLEY."
5,The Saviors of Art Rock,"Muse is the first great band of this decade, and Absolution is the first perfect CD. Since Yorke and the boys went all Billy Corgan on us, there has been a great void in the art-rock genre. Muse has filled that void single-handedly with this release. ""Stockholm Syndrome"" and ""Time is Running Out"" may have been the two best singles in 2004, and ""Hysteria"" is getting much-deserved attention this year. Each of those singles rock, but there is more to Absolution than these standouts. ""Thoughts of a Dying Atheist"" and ""Apocalypse Please"" and ""Ruled by Secrecy"" are flawless. The comparisons to Radiohead have regrettably blinded many people to Muse's talent, but Radiohead had their moment. It certainly was a great moment, but they've ditched their guitars and moved on. Now, it is clearly Muse's time. Art rock has never been better."
4,Ignore HMV's official review.,"Absolution is absolutely worthy of praise, but the description of Muse's style above is just flat out incorrect. This is not some head-banging, teeth-gnashing, hate-spewing metal act, this is Muse. While the comparison to The Bends-era Radiohead is pretty spot on, and the mood in most songs is dark, and the subject matter darker, Muse's sound on Absolution is far from grungey. Absolution sparkles with an upbeat, experimental vibe. To stick to the Radiohead comparison (though Muse easily stands on their own in substance and style), think of pumping Kid a/Amnesiac era paranoia and experimentalism into The Bends era guitar-driven rock. The sound is dramatic, slick, and big. It's strong, but not raw. You will not believe that the sound on Absolution came out of just three guys."
3,not too shaby!,"""running out of time"" great song. ""hysteria"" even better song. the rest of the tracks, just ok. this could have been a great album if there was a little more time spent on the songs that werent going to be singles. still not a total waste."
5,Excellent,Muse. Absolution. Vinyl. Need I say more than this?It is absolute brilliance. Every track radiates a different beauty that you can truly appreciate by having in the vinyl format with a good set of speakers. A Muse Have for all Muse and Vinyl fans!
5,Woooaaaahhhh!,"I can remember sitting in my room, and i decided to turn on the radio. Immediately i heard time is running out,and jumped with excitement at the thought of new material from the best band the westcountry has ever seen. I rushed out to buy absolution and i was by no means dissappointed. This album has taken a step in the right direction taking muse one step further to world domination. It may not me as heavy and experimetal as its predecessor the origin of symmetry, but it is still a great album, with some great tracks, interlude, thoughts of a dieing atheist and the small print to name just a few. Every moment on it is memorable, and shows off The incredible talent that is muse."
3,somewhat aMUSEing,"Muse is a hybrid of Our Lady Peace, Radiohead and Queen. Love the rockin guitars even if the songs sounds similar from track to track... not bad, but I'd tire of it quickly."
4,Hard work pays off,"I first discovered Muse by seeing their eery ""Stockholm Syndrome video. After hearing a live performance of ""Sing for Absolution"" I was convinced and bought the album. I must say, that this is one of the best albums of 2003. Muse is definitely one of the most underappreciatted bands in the United States."
5,No longer just Radiohead knock off,"I heard the Muse's old stuff and it was Radiohead ripoff material. Sorry to those who loved Showbiz. However, this; this is an album showing a band coming into its own ridiculously gorgeous self. This album is as otherworldly crazy as Queen, but with better melody, if you can believe that to be possible. Every song starts off for just a few seconds like a crappy Korn song, but just when you get disappointed it breaks into an amazing song with a whitewash of power. The lead singer, Bellamy, hits notes Thom Yorke could never reach. The whole thing is just so gloriously over the top you'll feel like it has to be a guilty pleasure. But its not! Be proud and play it at full volume!"
1,Not for ladies.,"I bought Ladies Home Journal for an elderly lady who gave it back to me saying it had a lot of inappropriate topics in it. I raised my eyebrows and took a good look at the magazine. What was I thinking? Clearly, I chose the magazine as a gift based upon the 'Ladies' part of the magazine's name, assuming it was for ladies.I did a little research and found an article interviewing Myrna Blythe, former editor-in-chief of this magazine who said, ""Women's magazines can be like bad boyfriends. They'll tear you down, then spend pages trying to build you back up."" Source: [..]I'm still looking for a magazine that provides good information and holds the reader capable of integrating the information how they choose into their life."
5,love it,"Arrived promptly and it tact > Love this magazine, it has always been one of my favorites , I think it has many attributes"
5,great for beginners,"excellent product, easy and light to use. Cuts my three little dogs hair with ease. needed to be recharged after the second dog haircut, but then again this was my first attempt in cutting hair, may took a little to long. Price was right for the product."
4,Smooth shaving!,This product cuts through the thickest of hair and the thinest of hair. I have two cocker spaniels and my older one has super thick hair and the younger one has thinner hair and these clippers cut them both equally well. The only downfall is if you're looking to use it cordless you only get about 30 minutes and the unit gets pretty warm to the touch. These are small negatives that are definitely something that can be overlooked because this product is really great!
2,Don't waste your money!,"The first time I used this clipper, I was very impressed that it runs quietly and really cuts easily through thick hair of my dog...but after the first time I used it...I wasn't able to use it again! After charging it for many hours...it ran for only for 3 minutes...then on my 3rd use, I wasn't even able to use it for a minute!! Yes, this clipper has a very poor battery life. Don't waste your money on this. Now I can't even use it and it turns off in 5 seconds..Such a waste..."
4,"Great album, outrageous Amazon review!","It's unbelievable that someone as ignorant as this Amazon reviewer can write music review for a living! With a name like his, something like Red Boudoir, no wonder he's confused! The only common feature of Khan and Geoff Tate is they both have short hair. Comparing Kamelot's catchy power fast-driven metal to Korn's subpar monotonous rapping thrashy metal is a disgrace! I don't wanna even talk about the other second rate band, A7X. My nephew is a Korn fan, he never heard of Deep Purple. That tells you how different Kamelot's fans are from the listeners of those bands Boudoir foolishly claimed Kamelot is emulating."
5,"Truly amazing, Kamelot takes another brilliant direction.","Ghost Opera proves the seemingly limitless potential of Kamelot.Masterfully arranged music with powerful lyrics, you will be taken places with this album."
3,good but could be better,"I have been a fan of Kamelot for five years now and this is far from thier best work. Don't get me wrong, the cd does grow on you the more you listen just like most of thier work. If you want to hear this band at the top of thier game i would suggest the forth legacy or karma."
2,Mediocrity at best,"I have heard sooooooo many things about Kamelot, and most of them were good. Most power metal bands' latest albums are usually never the best place to start and that's where I think I went wrong here.I really was not expecting much to begin with, and even then, I was disappointed. Not too many catchy choruses or memorable solos or anything... The album just doesn't stick out among many other power metal albums. Uhh, there's really not much else to say. I want to get more into Kamelot. To anyone else, this is not a good place to start in their discography."
3,Hoped for more...,"I was kinda dissapointed with this cd as I read in an interview with Kamelot that they felt that this was their best work yet. In my opinion it wasn't any better or worse than any of their other work. So...maybe I missed something in it, I don't know. It just didn't stand out at all. It's worth having in your Kamelot collection, though."
2,heard one song????,Well in that case you have heard it allAll the song sound exactly the same.When you want to hear some great power\prog metalTry savatageThis album is boring boring boring!!!!!
4,"Not their best, but still better than most metal out there","I own the rest of Kamelot's albums and maybe because this comes after such amazing releases like Epica and Black Halo, but I don't think this is their best. There are some good songs, but I can't say anything grabed me like some of their other CDs did.Still this is Kamelot so you know it's going to be better than most metal bands out there. Strongly recomended for all metal fans. As for fellow Kamelot fans, give it a shot. Maybe you'll like it better than I do."
5,"It works, just ask my wife who ridiculed me and paid for it!","Bought the book just before accepting a work assignment in the UK. Transatlantic travel is regular for me now. I follow the recommended diet regimen, etc. out of habit and am 85-90% adjusted to the new timezone less than 12 hours after arrival. My wife was skeptical and ignored the recommendations - ONCE. She paid dearly as she lived in a jet lag fog/nausea for 2 weeks. Followed the regimen, at least in spirit, the next trip and she was adjusted in less than 36 hours!If you travel across 2-3+ timezones regularly, you will be happier upon following this books recommendations."
2,Complex and Unproven,"This book may work for some people, but it does not deserve consistent ***** ratings. Eighteen years after the first printing, there is still only anecdotal evidence to support the book's detailed recommendations, and the heavy emphasis on complex eating patterns is especially controversial. The other general recommendations seem pretty mainstream, but could have been explained more simply in a much shorter book or pamphlet."
1,Not-so Constant-on,"I bought three Constant-on sets because I'm tired of hunting down bad/loose bulbs. Here I thought I'd just throw away the older sets when they stopped working for any reason. Imagine my surprise when only HALF the string of the third set of ""Constant-ons"" lit up! Jiggled a lot of the bulbs, reset a few; NOTHING! Seems like FALSE ADVERTISING to me. Now I've either got to return these, or dispose of them. I do NOT like GE."
2,Free Is Not Always Good,"I feel silly complaining about something that is free, but I'm going to delete this version from my Kindle and find one with better formatting. This one has a Table of Contents, but it only tells what is included, it won't guide you to anything.The text of The Rime of the Ancient Mariner is run together--at least it is not formatted in four-line stanzas as it should be (at the start, anyway), and the line numbers are inserted right into the text, so you read, ""The sun came up upon the left, 25 Out of the sea came he!"" etc. Worse than any of that are the VERY frequent annotations, which were inserted right into the text, believe it or not, ruining any chance of enjoying the poem's rhythm.One positive would be for the person that enjoys a monstrous introduction; I normally don't, but this one I like. The down-side to a monstrous introduction without an active Table of Contents is that you have to laboriously page your way through it to get to the poems."
4,Poem from my schooldays,Got this book simply to have a copy of the poem. About the only thing in english I enjoyed. Descriptions of the background to the work very useful and interesting.
5,Great Book Addressing Racism From A 'White' Perspective,"Tim Wise tackles the issue of racism on many dimensions. He gives you the history of white privilege in America, discusses the colour of divinity, talks about his experiences with racism, offers ways of combating racism, and so much more.In a society like America where racism occurs more often than not...at least, this has been my experience. This book lets you know that there are some people who are doing something about this problem and it prevents you from judging a whole group of people based on what you may have experienced from some of their members.I had the privilege of attending one of his lectures in California, and he signed three of his books for me. He also answered my question before I left the class, and I was touched. Thank you, Tim. God bless you."
1,A book-length lie,"There's a fundamental problem with ""White Like Me"": Tim Wise isn't white. He's Jewish. Ah, but Jews (or most Jews) are white, you say. Not in this sense.As used in this book, ""white"" is a political term defined according to Gramscian-Marxist principles. ""Whites"" are defined as an ""oppressor class"" without rights of any sort; ""Jews"" are defined as a ""victim class"". As a matter of logic, in the political sense, Jews cannot be ""white"". The book is an attempt to deligitimize the existence of whites, which is to say it is an attempt to legitimize the genocide of whites. How convenient of Wise to attack ""whites"" while maintaining an identity that is immune from attack!"
5,A Special Gift for New or Seasoned Moms,"In her book, No Greater Love, Loren captures motherhood in words as Anne Geddes captures babies through a camera lens. She has the phenomenal ability to ask simple questions that allow moms, new or seasoned, to notice how they appear in the eyes of their child and to savour all the magic moments, large and small. I get so excited when I hear someone I know is expecting. I already know what a treat it will be when they receive this book as a gift."
4,Classic Camp from Troma (Of Course!),"This is one of those movies that you guiltily rent as a teenager, hoping there'll be nudie scenes. Well, here your hopes are fulfilled, as there's naked chicks galore in this pre-Toxic Avenger ""teen summer camp"" comedy from Troma.Odd trivia about the film - a very, very young Vincent D'onofrio has a small part, and Madonna auditioned for the film but was turned down! Penthouse Pet of the Year Sheila Kennedy has a brief nude scene as well.The plot, such as it is, is about a small group of nerds who get sent to camp and trapped with their hot counselor, and then they all trade sex stories. The film is composed mostly of flashbacks to those stories, although there are some genuinely funny (in a gross-out Porkys/South Park kind of way) slapstick scenes at the beginning of the flick as we're introduced to the characters and the camp.Definately a classic - it you like this sort of movie, and I do."
3,Getting Better,"Unlike the current trend of Adventures in Odyssey where the quality of the shows were going down, this album presents a small promise of a return to the normal Adventures in Odyssey writing. With the introduction of a new villian, and the start of some long term arc episodes, The Big Picture hopefully will mark the upswing in Odyssey writing."
3,Torn Heart,"As a published writer, I would highly recommend that anyone who is remotely serious about writing, subscribe to this magazine. This magazine teaches you to create writing; others merely teach it. The most important and wonderful feature about writer's digest is that the magazine stresses the importance of discipline in a writer's work.So why only three stars? Reader's Digest is heavily overpopulated with contests in which you must pay to enter.What kind of aspiring writer, in their right minds,are going topay to enter a contest? Don't ever pay to enter a contest...there are too many free ones to enter.My second gripe is that WD is a baby step away from being called a catalog. It is chock full of useless advertisements for WD's writing products and book clubs, and the ads in the back are for suckers.You take the good with the bad, though. It's not a horrible magazine, and I have found some useful pointers along the way of my subscription."
1,Waste of Time and Money,"If you're serious about writing, don't waste your time and money on this publication written on a third grade level. The information is not helpful, as previously mentioned they have sleazy ads in the classifieds (stuffing envelopes anyone?) and THE WRITER is 100 times better. I'd give THE WRITER 5 stars."
4,cool gadget,"I love the MP3 key. I gave it 4 stars because i had to fork out an additional $15 at best buy for a car adapter. I would also like a fast forward/reverse feature, but I knew there was not one."
1,"Sorry excuse for a book titled ""complete""","This book (and his others) do not cover things from a ""complete"" standpoint. If you are looking for a book to help you design hardware from scratch THIS IS NOT IT. All hardware and references to hardware are for off-the-shelf demo boards or OEM products. This book is more about writing software for *existing* hardware."
3,Magazine is not what it used to be,"I ordered this magazine for my boyfriend and his first complaint was that the magazine was practicly all advertisement and hardly anything actually readable in the whole thing. I've noticed this is a new trend with magazines, as I read my Cosmo a couple months ago and the first 30 pages or so was advertisement. I used to get this magazine about 6 years ago and I remember it being thicker and having more interesting stuff in it. I'm not too disapointed though because after all I did get it at a highly discounted price of $5.00 for a year subscription and to me, that's one and a half issues off the stands at the store so I'm really not upset I spent my money on it. For those of you who don't know anything about this magazine it's similar to FHM or a guy version of Cosmo."
4,Maxim,"I've been a long time Maxim Magazine subscriber, since the beginning really. I've seen the magazine change and at times have not been happy. Most recently with the demise and return of the Jokes page. The pictures of the stars are great but I think the spreads are to short. In the beginning the Magazine was AWESOME, but now it is just OK."
3,It is what it is,"It is a fun magazine to glance through as you wait for your oil to get changed. In these tough economic times I am so glad we have a magazine that will bodly test and rate the dozens of expensive premium tequilla's that are out there. Honestly, I had no idea that there were so many different types of really expensive tequilla! This is not the forum for thoughtful commentary or intelligent discourse on vital issues of the day but the movie reviews were kind of funny. After reading it I actually felt stupider and older. I will enjoy the year but let the subscription lapse."
5,Long time fan...,While I think Maxim had better years... Dan Bova's done some good work and this magazine remains a delightfully satirical view on pop culture from a man's man point of view.
1,Maybe I need glasses,"Very dissapointed in magazine. Im 43 and currently dont wear eye glases, but the print in this magazine is ridicolously small. So I have thumbed through the first edition and now and looking to cancel, and doin't even care if I get a refund. keep my money and good luck in business"
1,Zero stars,This is seriously the worst magazine in the world . I got 1 year free subscription and still it wasnt worth it.
1,Do not get this if you care what it looks like.,"For one they are behind a month. Two they don't even send it in anything so the magazine is crumpled. Three they don't post a label on it, it is on the actual magazine. Get it from the actual site or find it in stores. Sucks from here."
1,Maxim is trash.,"I don't know what I was thinking. I thought Maxim was more like a ""Men's issues/health/style/etc."" type magazine. It's soft porn, mostly. The articles are uninteresting and poorly written. In fact, it feels a lot like reading a 15 year old boy's school homework, if he could write with no inhibitions nor worry of getting in trouble for honesty. I would know, I'm a teacher, and this magazine has the sophistication level of just that, a 15 year old boy."
4,"I Know Its Hard, But Look Past The Babe On The Cover","I look forward to seeing my Maxim magazine in my mailbox each month. The articles in the magazine are hilarious and the pictorials are fantastic. Its a wonderful thing to have along on a long road trip or a boring wait in an airport terminal.The articles range from silly ""How To"" articles about making liquor in prison to well-researched journalistic gems about terrorism or Saddam Hussein's sons. This magazine doesn't disappoint.If I had to come up with a negatice aspect for Maxim, I'd have to say that there are a few too many advertisements with men in their underwear for my taste. It seems as though lately, there is a lot more advertising but the quality of the articles and pictorials has remained consistent so its really not that important.Needless to say, my wife wasn't very happy when the first issue arrived but now she's a regular reader. I think that speaks more about this magazine than anything else."
4,A MAgazine for every man,"This magazine is good for the person who is interested in everything manly. With interesting articles and hot girls, the magazine is one that i will be getting monthly for a long time"
1,"worst service ever, i never got not even one issue.","worst service ever, i never got not even one issue, i performed this suscription like in march, today is augost the 23rd, and nothing. I want a refound!"
4,Not A Bad Deal,"We all know what Maxim is, a slightly rougher, non-nude version of Playboy. It is what it is, and if you like it you can't beat the price for a years subscription."
1,DIDN'T RECEIVE EVEN ONE ISSUE!,"This has to be the worst service ever!! Don't know why amazon keeps selling this magazine when apparently I'm not the only one who has had this issue. I wrote several times to the publisher asking about the problem and they didn't answer not one email! So, basically they stole my money!"
4,What more is there to say? It's MAXIM!,"This is what it is. If you like beautiful women, and some (sometimes) decent articles, then this is hard to beat. The subscription price is good, too."
1,Should now be a 0 star,"I loved Maxim years ago, i even liked Stuff, which had pretty much no information in it. Maxim might as well be Men's Journal now. Crap! No longer the fun mag it once was. No longer am I ammused. Where did the Jokes go, where are the hot chicks, what's up with all the stupid suits??? Thier is no longer any meaningful content, maybe if I was 60 it would work! I'm mad that I have to wait 8 more months for the magazine to stop showing up!"
1,I haven't got my magazine yet,I never received a copy of this magazine i am still waiting on my first issue.
2,The Devil's Grammar is more like it...,"The story was so-so. At first Ethan irked me and I just wanted him to get over it (his revenge). Then nearing the end Ethan was more understanding and responsible toward his family, and he grew on me. Then it was Grace who needed a good slap! She was too impulsive and ALWAYS running off and getting into the most absurd situations . . .Now, I like Kat Martin because she is simplistic (overly so, at times) and basically gives her readers plenty of sex (honesty from this reviewer). But, the woman needs a new editor! The writing contained tons of errors, the most glaring being that she does not capitalize titles for nobility. It should be the Earl of blah, blah! At one point Grace is called Lady Sharpe (her husband's last name, not his title), names are often mixed up and countless other errors occur that just added to my annoyance and made this novel unenjoyable.Not that it was completely horrible, but it seemed like a rough draft instead of the finished product."
2,"I agree with ""Who chose these...?!!!""","Look, Tom Hanks is a gifted comedic actor who must have done more on SNL than this DVD represents. As previously stated, the chosen skits are worth an occasional chuckle at best, and some feature very little of Mr. Hanks at all... This DVD was a major disappointment and a nearly-complete waste of money to me. I liked the ""Best of Steve Martin"" significantly better, and this DVD doesn't even hold a candle to ""The Best of Alec Baldwin""... Having purchased those two DVDs prior to this one, and based on the reviews, I was expecting so much more, but obviously some people are more easily amused than I am..."
1,"I love Tom Hanks, I love SNL, but come on....","Tom Hanks is great and he really did some fun stuff with SNL, but this dvd left a lot to be desired. While most of the ""SNL Best of"" discs have me laughing out loud throughout the entire presentation, this particular collection just left me wondering why they didn't choose some better skits. The highlight of this dvd comes at the end when Christopher Walken appears for a few minutes. The rest is junk. You'd be better off buying another collection if you're looking for some good SNL fun."
4,"impossible to casually peruse, but invaluable to the serious","This text has been and still is tremendously illuminating to me. Though I have read it as casual reading a couple times, I have found it most useful when digested a concept at a time. The explanations while thick are neccessarily so. Professor Cheng has throughly described each motion and it's application. A very complex task indeed. Each time I work out I pick a section of the book and try to refine that portion of the form. Each time I am amazed by Cheng Tzu's ability to turn a movement I have made thousands of times into something new and amazing. I highly recommend this text to any serious student of Tai Chi. I also warn any novice student that they should start with one of Cheng Man Ching's more elementary texts. This one is difficult to comprehend if aren't already familiar with Cheng Man Ching's style of Tai Chi."
5,The most envisioning fantasy book of the decade.,"Firstborn takes place before the popular events of the Dragonlance saga, respectively about 1,000 years fictional time before the series' focal points, the Majere Twins, Tanis Half-Elven, The second Cataclysm, etc. The book's literary genius is found in its ability to render classical romance and youthful intrigue so quickly, the romantics never complicated but desirably easy to relate to. This is the book that I would recommend any new fantasy reader to first touch down upon, but better yet a way for experienced fantasy readers to find for themselves a remnant of classical fantasy, by no means nostalgia however. A+"
5,A brillinat story of alley generations.,"The rise and fall of generations in an Egyptian alley is the focus of Mahfouz's great parable. The story covers many themes, and evokes much thought while remaining extremely interesting. Arabic writing is great fun to read, and Mahfouz's story telling skills generate curiosity and a need to check out his other works."
2,Disappointing Rip-Off,"This blatant rip-off of IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE lacks the heart and substance of its predecessor. Cooper is woefully miscast as the Jimmy-Stewart-aw-shucks-nice-guy who would give the shirt off his back (AND the backs of his wife and 2 small children) to help out anyone with a sob story. The humor is NOT, and the cliches are tedious. Sheridan is wasted as the wisecracking wife who laughs too much and too loudly. Her long-suffering character unfairly ends up being depicted as the ""bad guy"" in order to color Cooper's selfish irresponsibility ""charity."" All in all, a poor movie."
1,Defective Discs,"Do NOT purchase this set. It is defective (as mentioned previously). I have experienced quality issues with previous seasons but not this bad. I've purchased this set from different retailers, all with the same defect. Lions Gate must have the poorest QA procedures in the business."
2,Loud and ineffectual,I was surprised that it really didn't do much compared to the 1950s version that I'd inherited. Keeping a wet wash cloth next to my bed for when I start coughing in the middle of the night works better.
4,It's a must HEAR!,"This was my first audiobook. It was great. The reader did an excellent job of maintaining voice differentiation, allowing me, the listener, to follow the story without becoming confused. I was able to receive a true visual of the atmosphere. I could actually feel and imagine what the characters where experiencing."
2,a classic example of mismeasurement due to category error,This report represents a classic example of limited inquiry in academic pursuits by relentlessly ignoring category error (insufficient definitions) as challenged since the early '90s by Mandel (Businessweek 5/18/94) and others (Edupage 2/21/95). It is now finally contradicted by the NAICS data (USA Today 3/20/99).
3,Freeze Frame Footage causes buyer's regret,"After painstakingly searching for Submitted...I finally located a copy on Amazon! But to my amazement...after viewing for a while I noticed ""freeze frame in the footage!"" I had to rewind a few times and hit play again to continue. Unfortunately I will have to get another copy.Roni Mathews"
1,What a waste,A complete rip-off that bets there are enough wannabe poets out there to sink their bucks into this bit of self-indulgent garbage.
1,poorly executed text,"This textbook is a mess. It is not elegant or clear, and their coverage of certain topics is confusing and deviates from standard practice. If your algorithms class is using this text, find some friends to pool together and get a copy for the exercises if they are used, otherwise take the book from MIT by Rivest et al out of the library and read that.Introduction to Algorithms"
1,A Student's Review,"I'm a 4th year undergraduate student in computer science and I just finished the Design and Analysis of Computer Algorithms course that was based on this book.I thought the book was horrible. It did little to help me understand anything but general ideas. Reading this book is like reading a volume of mathematical proofs. The authors speak in symbols.What makes it much worse is that every page makes multiple references to other portions of the text that aren't on the facing pages. They might be one page turn away, but very often they are a few pages, or even chapters away!The only reason I would keep this book is for the list of topics it covers."
3,Not bad could be better,"I am a CS major and I was required to get this book for my Algorithms class, I wasn't too dissapointed with it but I didn't see much in it either. The major flaw is this book would have to be the code, I know it is a algorithms book and code shouldn't matter. I like the idea of psuedo java code. But the fact that the code is much more complicated than it has to be can make it tough for some people to follow it. Also throughout the book there are a lot of ""refer to blah"", and blah is a couple chapters back. So you spend a minute looking for blah and when you finally find it you forget why you are looking at it.The book does have a good but quick intro to the math needed throughout the rest of the book, but it might be a little too quick for some. For almost every algorithm there is a thorough explanation, proof, and whatever else is needed.All in all this isn't a bad book but you could probably find better."
2,"A clean text dump, without annoying images.","This book really didn't give much at all. Much because of its useless explainations, that are probably really juicy if you already know it and pretty worthless if you don't... I didn't. Just one thing to do, attend all classes if you got this book for class litterature, and if you live in Canada or as I do in Sweden, use it as fire wood-substitute when it's cold...(Hmm does layout spell ""n-o-t-e-p-a-d""?)"
1,Piece of crap!!,"I purchased the Cuisinart SmartPower 600 watt blender (CB600SIL) from Costco and since it was my first Cuisinart purchase I expected nothing but the best. Over the course of about a month, a lot of crud started building up inside the metal parts of the top part of the processor. I was unable to get this crud out, and when I called to complain, Cuisinart sent me a new blender top. Yippee! I thought. Then one day about two months later it stopped working. Stopped completely. Doesn't even work at all. Doesn't even light up. I called Cuisinart and their attitude was, well, too bad. I feel completely traumatized. I have never purchased an item that stopped working so quickly after I purchased it. I cannot believe this big reputation company makes such a crappy piece of equipment and then has the nerve to sell it. I will never buy another Cuisinart item again."
4,"Powerful, Easy to Use",I found this blender to be very powerful and crushes ice easily. It's easy to pull apart and clean. Comes with a recipe book that has great smoothie recipes! I recommend this blender to anyone looking for a powerful heavy duty blender without spending a fortune!
2,Smoked and died after 6 months,"We loved this blender and was very handy. Unfortunatly, after 6 months it smoked and died. Will return it and will stay away from Cuisinart."
4,"Good Survey, But Now Dated","(First of all, it should be pointed out that ""Native American"" in the title does not refer to indigenous inhabitants, the book was written before that term had come into use. It refers to anarchism that had not been imported from elsewhere.) This gives a good summary of several different anarchist traditions in America, starting with antinomianism among colonials and later religious non-resistants, up to the anarcho-individualists like Benjamin Tucker and Lysander Spooner. The last chapter compares them with the imported anarcho-communism of Emma Goldman etc. The book is short and treatment is often summary, but it makes a good introductory guide."
4,I LOVE THIS SONG,THIS SONG IS REALLY NICE. I UNDERSTAND IT AND ALL AND IN A WAY IT KINDA RELATES TO ME. EVEN THOUGH THE SONG IS OLD NOW I STILL LIKE IT ALOT.I LISTEN TO IT ALMOST EVERYDAY. DEBRAH IS NICE AND KEEP GIVING US THOSE NICE SONGS.
3,"Watched it once, but won't watch it again. Not going on the Christmas list.","It was alright to watch once and very different, but also was one I enjoyed. I wouldn't say it is a very Christmas movie though, although it is leading up to Christmas eve. Not like Bishops wife, Its a wonderful life, the Bells of St Marys, Holiday Inn (of which are all on my favorites list for Christmas movies). The old lady is very unusual and her character unique - the one thing I did enjoy about the movie was her character."
3,ABP,"Like the style, weight and feel of the pen. Unfortunately after only a couple of weeks of use the point changing mechanism began to fail. Nit happy."
5,Great pen,Very fine pen. The twist method works very well. Inks are good and it has the right weight. Great buy!
5,Perfect Gift,"My father loves pens and just got an iPad - so this is the perfect combo - the all-in-one tool where he'll never need to take anything aside from the iPad, a notepad and this great pen - the idea is great and it looks great and works great."
3,Cross,I was a little disappointed in this product. If you have big hands it feels like a stylus. I usually love Cross product but not this one. I thought the Cross tech four was a better product.
2,A book to put you to sleep,This book is about an African American mother and her struggles to fight poverty while raising her eight year old son. The book starts out slow and continues this way. Although the author picks up the pace of the book in a few places these are few and far between. The book as a whole brings a good message but is so riddled with over detailed flashbacks and descriptions of characters and settings that this message is hard to follow and is sometimes lost in the detail. If you want to read this book do it while consuming large amounts of coffee or while you have a case of insomnia it's the only way you will get more that a few pages.
2,Paranoid,"This book is for the paranoid. This book of eighteen chapters had a one main theme. Everyone was out to get her. She was ruined because a man couldn't have her. She missed her big break because the a man wanted her. There where some other topics. They lead back to men wanting her. The final chapter was aburpt but expected.The are many redeeming quality of this book. She explained economic and racial conditions at this time of history. The book was full of vivid imagiary and indepth charchaters. The novel dicated a chapter to each person, or family. This made the reasoning for the ending clear."
2,Review,"I gave this book two stars because I am not big on reading books that include every detail of every second. I realie that when writing fiction books you must show a lot of detail to make the reader feel as though it is a real place or time but, when the main characters breakfast is describe to a ""T"", that is getting a little dicouraging. Ann Petry did write a good book, better than I could of wrote and I would recommend reading it to others but, I would never read it again. The ending left a little to be desired as well. When a book makes it hard for you to stay interested and then kind of leaves you hanging at the end it makes it hard to give it a good review."
3,from a students perspective,"The book ""The Street"" by Anne Petry was an interesting book in itself, however, it was hard to decide how accurate it was in its depiction of Harlem. This is primaryily due to the fact that it is rather extreme, and not knowing how much Anne acctully knew about Harlem. Besides this, it was a readable book, and is well worth reading. At first, it doesn't seem like it is going to be a great book, but as you go on it does indeed become more appealing to read."
4,Nate Dogg in the Street With Ann Petry,"This novel was a gripping story of poverty and distress. It was very descriptive, and it gives the reader an in depth look on life in the city. Although Petry overendulges into her detail many times throughout the book, if one can hold on to the topic at hand, while taking in the details of what is given to them, you almost feel as though you are in the story yourself. This conflict of losing track of yourself comes into play often with the flashbacks, and the elaborateness of them. The best way to avoid getting lost, is to wait until after the flashbacks are over to put the book down. This is not hard to do, for once the relatively slow beginning is through, it is a challenge to stop reading."
4,"Real life, beautifully written","This book was lent to me by a friend who described it as ""a little jewel."" She was right. Ann Petry has captured the essence of a tragic life - a mother's heart filled with hopes and dreams for her young son - beaten down by the street she is forced to call home . Memorable characters - memorable ending. A very moving and insightful story. Written in 1946, this story is timeless, and well-worth the read. I couldn't put it down."
4,Realism at its best!,"This work gripped me from the get go in a way that only a few other novels, such as ""crime and punishment,"" have. Each time I picked it up I was astounded by the clarity and energy of Petry's writing, and found myself wondering why I had not discovered her work before. That other reviewers have found it difficult to follow the plot reflects in no way on Petry's prose. There are a few lengthy flashbacks which are integral to the books insights into urban culture. I did not find that these detracted from the story, as they were as key to the development of the plot line.""The Street"" is a great piece of fiction, that should be much more widely read. Petry makes a number of sociological observations that reach beyond the time of ""the street,"" and remain disappointingly relevant today."
2,Truth Appears To Be Elusive,"The ""truth"" that unfolds in this book is nothing more than propaganda (from family and friends) masquerading as truth. After reading this you would think River was a Sage or even a Saint. Drugs destroyed his life; not Hollywood. There are many sensitive souls in Hollywood who manage quite well without polluting and killing them selves with a lethal cocktail of illict drugs. Sad thing is Generation X doesn't want to take any accountability for their poor decisions. Everybody else is at fault.River Phoenix's brother (Joaquin) who had the same whacked out parents and unstable childhood hasn't destroyed his life with drug addiction. The fact is when you make bad choices you have no one to blame but yourself. The guy had it all and he blew it...big time. In the end he deceived quite a few people; including himself. Like Icarus he flew too high and plunged to his death. Another life annihilated by Hubris..."
1,FAKE,"This is not the real Hugo cologne. I know the scent very well. Secondly, the bottle I received does not match the bottle pictured, which is in fact the real bottle. Shame on Amazon."
4,HUGO,A classic cologne that won't get you any originality points but will definitely get compliments.
2,una colonia...,"una colonia sin mucho que decir, aroma se esfuma a las horas, no tiene cuerpo, no es un olor especial"
5,Women say I always smell nice!,I have been wearing this cologne for some time now and women always tell me that I smell nice when wearing it. Great price and deal for Prime Members!
4,A great beach or poolside read,"Typical Danielle Steel fluff, but one of her better books. A little of everything: love, betrayal, tragedy, and hope."
3,Steel is returning,"After being extremely dissapointed in her last few books (ie The Klone for one), I was happy to see that Steel is coming back in ""Summer's End"". I read the book in a day and could not put it down. I found myself, as in earlier Steel books, being absorbed into and fighting for the young women. If you love Steel, you'll like this one, classic Steel material."
1,Don't waste your time,"This movie was garbage just like ""Urban Menace"" what in the world is Ice-T ,and Silkk the Shocker thinking about. This had the same actor's the same setting ,and more bad acting ,and bad editing as ""Urban Menace"" Ice-T done lost his damn mind."
4,Cute,"For the price this was perfect. Used as a joke for someone's team name was ""big Shiny Disco Balls"". Even tho not BIG it made the point nonetheless...haha"
3,dosco ball more like christmas ordament.will not work in car,it is a little bit bigger than a golf ball! it has a string like a christmas ordament.it lookes like it is a homemade!christmas ordament! it is so weak you can proboly break it with two fingers.and the car disco ball more like a key chean disco ball the string is likethe string on it is like 3 in long and like 7 in un tied.but hay you get what you pay you know.you will have to un tie it to fit it on your car mirror and it is like 2 in thick.my ote is false abver tising.
2,Out-of-date,"This tiny little book appears not to have been updated since its original publication in 1956- meaning it that it's missing a lot of phrases we need now and includes vocabulary (ashtrays, handkerchiefs) not of much use today. I bought this for French and simultaneously bought the Lonely Planet Phrasebook for German. Wish I had gotten it for French too."
4,Handy phrase book for a trip to France,"This is a small, handy phrasebook that is perfect for traveling. It will fit in a small purse and contains all the necessary French terms. I bought this is as a goody bag gift for a French-themed bridal shower, which worked out well since the wedding was in France."
2,Very disappointing,"I have been with 5ive from the beginning, so I was really excited to finally get Kingsize. With songs like ""Cold Sweat"" and ""Don't Wanna Let You Go,"" I thought this would be the best album I've ever gotten. But, I was wrong. Horribly wrong. This album had too much bubble gum pop, stale bubble gum pop, and not enough of the edgy, bad-boy beats that made them famous in the first place."
2,A boring movie,"I watched this movie in Spanish class because we were learning about Quinceaneras and about Illegal Immigrants. Some themes that were brought up in the movie were illegal immigrants, quinceaneras and how hard mexicans had to work.I liked that the movie taught you how hard it was to become an American Citizen. My favorite part of the movie was when Marta helped her Father. I didn't like how her father followed her around everywhere. He was too strict.I wouldn't recommend this video because it was boring. Even though it was educational, people wouldn't be able to see the whole thing because they would fall asleep because it was so boring.Reviewed by a 7th grade student.R.T"
3,A good Movie,"We watched the movie because in Spanish class we were learning about immigration and Quinceanera. The major themes were immigration,Ouinceanera and Mexican culture. I really liked the surprise ending. I liked it when someones car door fell off it was really funny. I didn't like when the girls sreamed ""LaMigra"". It was mean it made everyone run. I would recommend it to a spanish teacher if she was teaching about immigration and Quinceanera. I think it was excellent. Reviewed by: GD"
4,interesting,We watched Sweet 15 because It was a movie about a quince and they have a lot to do about Mexian culture.I would recommend this to a family who injoy watchig movies togther.This movie was a great family movie full of real life experences that people go through ever day.I also thought the them was disimformitive and not in the right place for it at diffrent times.I also thought they could of added more on her quince then the fathers problem.I recommend this moives to people who like to learn about different cultures M.G
2,Asi-Asi,"the name of the movie is sweet 15. the main characters names are marta, remon,samule,jacky, and gabie. I watch this movie to learn about quinceanera and immigration. i thought that acting was good for a low budget film. my favorite part of the moviewas when remon keptpulling up in different cars and the last car the door fell off.what i did not like was that the movie was mostly about immigration and not a lot about quinceanera this is why i give the movie 2 stars. i would recommend this movie to people that likes low budget movies. i would also recommend this to teachers becouse it was fun to watch and you learn a lot.this movie is asi-asi."
2,outragelousy boring,"???hWe watched this movie for spanish class. Three major topics that were covered were immigration,Quinceanera, and love. One thing that I really liked about this movie is the government issues. This is the only thing that kept me from falling asleep. My favorite part of the movie was when Ramon's car door fell off. It was really funny. I didn't like when Jorge got deported because he was my favorite character. I really wouldn't reconmend this movie. It was very boring and i fell asleep If i could come up with one word wor the whole entire movie I would have to say Boring!???h"
2,Touching yet Boring,"I watched this movie in Spanish class because we were learning about Quincea?era. Some themes that were brought up in the movie were family, quincea?era, and immigration. What I liked about the movie was the social events because it showed events that may show up in real life. My favorite part of the movie was when Marta's cousin stepped on her foot.What I didn't like about the movie was the acting because it was too dramatic. I would recommend this movie to a spanish teacher looking for a movie for her student on a Quincea?era.Reviewed by a sixth grade student A.P."
5,One of the best ever!,"Way Station is definitely one of the bestsci-fi books ever written. Very typically for Saimak, it is incrediblywarm and humane. In a way it leaves you a better person. END"
4,classic book of SF from it's best period,"actually i don't have much to add to the previous review. he realy said what i thought about the book. the book was great and very imaginative, but the end was very ""holliwood"" style - but what's so bad whith happy endings, when life outside doesn't seem so full of them ?"
1,Skip it!,"Do you like thought provoking sci-fi with interesting, innovative plots that are relevant to life's many questions, a fast paced plot, and well fleshed out characters? Then skip this book! Its written with all the skill and innovativeness of a high school junior's aptitude. Imagine a decent 10 page story stretched into a horribly mediocre novel, and you get this book."
3,Movie Rights,"Simak's estate should consider pushing to sell the movie rights to this work, especially given the current political climate. Someone like Lance Henriksen or Denzel Washington (think about it) would be terrific.The book is short, but still manages to wander - the subplot about Enoch's imaginary friends isn't really necessary, and the whole arc of the intergalactic community's politics and Earth's place in it - as well as the religious stuff about the Talisman - would have benefited from more attention.That aside, Enoch Wallace and Ulysses are two of SF's strongest characters, and the book is really a buddy picture about these two fine creatures and their relationship across more than 100 years. Too, it is a finely turned tale about loneliness and alienation that nothing else I've read on those two subjects touches.Someone would do well to write a spec screenplay and shop it around."
1,Very Disappointed,"I just started following through the step by step instructions in this book, which begin in chapter 2. The first two pages instruct you to start with a base ""fla"", then give you 14 steps to follow. A snapshot of the timeline is presented in the book as what it should look like at the end of the steps. If you follow the steps, your timeline will greatly differ from the image in the book, and from the ""finished"" timeline on the CD. One or two differences on the first set of instructions would be bad enough, but I stopped counting at 11. It's a shame - this type of book is just what I needed, but now I'm reluctant to continue. I would be embarrassed if I were the author."
1,don't buy this book,"great learning tool my ... , this book has tons of errors, no errata, and no companion webpage. it was poorly written, and poorly edited, remind me never to buy another new riders book again. it doesn't matter how well you know flash, you shouldn't have to go through a book and fix all the errors to get something to work. from the publisher ""she heard of a need for this type of book, where none existed."" there are plenty of books out there that cover server side flash and flash app dev., if i were you reading this review, thinking about buying this book, i would go buy anything from the ""friends of ed"" series. they have excellent books, coldfusion for flash, php and advanced php for flash, flash and xml, dynamic content studio, i recommend any of those over this book. there are some others also, ""reality coldfusionmx and flash mx integration"", ""server side flash,"" these are just a few well written books that are coming to mind."
5,I Own It and Would Buy It Again!!!,"This is adult urban music at it's best. Originally released in 1991, the song's on this album played on both Smooth Jazz and Urban Adult radio. Take Control, Whatever, In and Out of Love, Wishful Thinking, I Live For You, and Time After Time are the best songs in this group. I highly recommend this disc for your collection."
3,Not what I expected,I know that you should read about the product information but when you see the pictures of this magnifiers you expect a lot more that you find in your hands
2,Hoping This Pays Out,"The Good:Well written. A consistent world, and a consistent feel, even though the vignettes are by different people. Imaginative. Makes you wonder what life could be like if you drew an ace. Makes you glad if you haven't drawn a joker.The Bad:It reminds me of a series of Alfred Hitchcock or Rod Serling stories. That in itself isn't bad. But as the collection appears to be something of an intro into the world. All the characters are central characters, and because they all stand out, none of them do. This is most of the reason for only two stars. I couldn't invest into any one character, because all the stories are about different people. In a way, it reminded me of a soap opera. Too many connections to invest in.The Nice:I found myself identifying with Jet Boy most, which I guess is reasonable, because he was simply talented, not genetically altered.Anyway, I'll put V II on my list, but it won't be on my urgent list, if you know what I mean."
1,Like a spiders web,"My wife and I had a very difficult time setting this thing up, and then it was very iffy in the wind. For the price we would have been better off with an Easy-Up style canopy. This thing looks cool but lacks functionality. Very disappointed. I thought Columbia made good stuff, but I dont think they make their own tents. I've not seen many good reviews on their stuff."
5,The best low-fat cookbook ever,"This book was filled with recipes, as well as helpful tips. My husband and I got this book in June of last year. Today he has lost 75 pounds and I have lost 54. We are keeping it off. What I like best about this book is that the ingredients are everyday ones. I don't have to hunt or go to the store everytime I find a different receipe. My 18-year old son loves the dishes, and he doesn't know there is virtually no fat in them. He told his girlfriend that his mother had taken a class or something because her food was better than ever. I don't think you will go wrong buying this book. I know it has paid for itself many, many, many times over."
5,As Close To Perfection As Music Gets,"I have been listening to the Goo Goo Dolls for a few years, yet didn't fall absolutely in love with the music until a couple months ago when I purchased ""Dizzy Up The Girl"". This is the pinnicle of all Goo music...better than the rest by far. Lead singer, John Rzeznik, and the band go above and beyond the stereotype they had picked up of sending out one-hit-wonders with this album. The feeling one gets when listening to this music is amazing; and you'll know when you hear it that you'll never be the same again. UNBELIEVABLE. ROCKING. PASSIONATE. EVERYTHING IS IN THIS ALBUM."
1,It deserves no attention,"Drivel, straight-up pop sappiness. Horrid lyrics, mediocre musicianship. I couldn't even believe ""Slide"" even got radio play. I can understand ""Iris"" though I can't stand that song either...it tugs at the heart-strings of any sentimental person. ""It's our song""...seemed to be the phrase every couple in the USA seemed to be saying when the song ""Iris"" came into a conversation. How sweet, that it's everybody else's song too. The sooner this song is forgotten, the better."
3,Pleasant fluff,"The Goo Goo Dolls are an engaging band that exhibit better than average musicianship and a high energy level. Their songs are well constructed and melodic on the whole--standard pop stuff. The album is a nice road CD--good background music that moves along without ever really engaging on any emotional level.It's sort of Enya with a bit of an edge--when it's all done you realize it was nice enough but if there was a message, you totally missed it.For those who are looking for the muzak version of the soundtrack for their life, the Goo Goo Dolls represent a good choice. If you like a bit more emotional and philosophical content with your tunes, this probably will disappoint. But it's still a good CD to have around--the sort of thing you can plug in any time and no one's going to object. There are times when that is an attribute to be valued.But it's hard for me to believe anyone can really think of this as ""great music"". It's very pleasant fluff is all."
1,The death of youth.,I really can't believe how so many people can be so deluded in thinking that this stuff is any good. To claim this is alt-rock demonstrates a complete ignorance of the genre. Alt-rock at its lamest doesn't get this lame. If I could award no stars I would. What's wrong with you all? You are all old people in young peoples' bodies and it makes me so sad that you should settle for so little. Shame and pity on you all.
2,dizzy up,"I don't listen to this kind of music as I really hate the whole radio/alternatine scene. I worked in a music store when this album was released and must have heard it 5 or 6 times a day as we had to play new releases in the store. Although there is no talent in this band vocal or instrument wise, the music made me reminisce about high school days. Anyway, this was a flavor of the day type band who has been forgotten about by now. It was obviously a group created by music execs to have some radio play, milk every dime that it was worth and then thrown out like old chewing tobacco. It's such a shame how music is being ruined like this."
4,an excellent choice,"this cd is one of the best that i havebought in awhile. its full of gud songs such as slide, broadway(my fav), black balloon, and iris(even though i always forget the words). if ur a fan of matchbox 20 3rd eye blind and others this cd is 4 u"
4,"Some Great Songs, But a couple are bad","They put together a very large variety of their songs, and made it worth the money. This is probably the best Goo Goo Dolls CD out there."
5,Now this is real music!!!,"When I first got this CD, I thought most of the songs sucked, but when I listened to the album through, every time I liked it more and more. Every song is a winner, from Robbie's spine-tingling voice in ""Amigone"", to all of John Rzeznick's songs, which are my personal faves. Now you might think you have to be a grunge loving teenage to early 30s guy to like this kind of stuff, but actually I'm a 13 year old girl, and a fan of the Backstreet Boys. Maybe I just have a wider variety of music tastes than most people, but if you liked any of their singles, it's definitely worth a try. My personal favorites on this CD: Iris, Black Balloon, Slide, Dizzy, Acoustic #3, and Bullet Proof. But I really love them all!"
1,Do not order from this user,it took the user 2 weeks to decide to ship the packagethats not the bad part the cd was promised in like new condition and it has a cracked cd case with tape all over to hold it together and the cd has scraches all over........NOT HAPPY WITH SERVICE AT ALL
5,A Goo Fan From Georgia,"The Goos Have Done it again! On their new CD I enjoy listening to Dizzy,Slide,Broadway,January Friend,Black Ballon,Bullet Proof,All Eyes On Me, Acoustic #3,Iris,Extra Pale and Hate This Place. John is such a doll.I have my own shrine of John, Robby and Mike.I've enjoyed their music since the CD Super Star Carwash came out."
4,I love it!!,I could listen to Slide and Iris all day.. The Goo Goo Dolls definitley have talent. I would kill to have someone sing those things to me!!! I find myself singing their songs often...
2,utterly insipid,"I swear I'm going to break my radio the next time I hear ""Iris"" on it. Musically, the Goo Goo Dolls (what is UP with their stupid name, anyway?) are a fairly decent band -- they're one of the more talented crap bands on the radio these days. But then... Rush is, musically, a very talented band. That doesn't mean I like them."
1,Sad decline into pop schmaltz,"Believe it or not, there was a time when the GGD's made some great rock and roll. Just listen to the first three records ""Goo Goo Dolls"", ""Jed"", and ""Hold Me Up"". Sadly those days are long gone and the Goo's see fit to be the new darlings of ballad radio. Well, I'm sure they're gettiing all the money and women they want now that they've 'made it""; it's just a shame they had to give up the great rock and roll they once played. Fans of their early stuff, check out Feeder."
1,"Too Wordy, Not Enjoyable","A very difficult read. I am college-educated, did OK on my SATs, consider myself intelligent, but found so much of this book went right over my head. So much of what this author had to say could have been written with a lot more clarity. I felt like I was reading someone's disertation. A lot of big words that were not needed. It made the reading of this book unenjoyable."
4,prestado de exodusltd.com,"Olga Nolla, descendiente de una larga historia de poetas y narradores puertorriqueños, hilvana la historia de dos mujeres en El manuscrito de Miramar.

5,Review,"I can't complain about the product, the service, or the delivery. Everything was very satisfactory."
2,Was it sent?,I have not received this yet. When I do I am certain I will like it as I purchased one magizine locally before ordering this.
1,OMG,"This is the most boring, uneventful and soul-destroying bilge that I have ever had the misfortune of being dragged along to. Not as enjoyable as razor-blading your own eyeballs whilst eating raw sewage.(Probably)"
5,Can't wait to watch more,"Season 1 popped up as a suggested ""instant"" movie for me on Netflix. It took a few minutes to get used to the laugh track and some of the humor, but by the time I finished watching the first episode I was hooked. My friends and I still quotes lines from it, several months after first watching it. We are all anxiously waiting to see Season 2, to be released in just a few days."
5,Laugh-till-you-cry IT Crowd,There aren't too many things that make me laugh until I cry - the IT Crowd is one of those things though. British comedy at its finest. Had to buy a copy for my brother the minute I saw the US version.
5,One of the best shows EVER!,"This show is absolutely hilarious. British TV is just better than US programming in general. If you work with computers, you will definitely get a kick out this show. This was the only show that I enjoyed literally every single episode. Moss is just the best! Enjoy!!"
1,Really not funny,"Based on all the reviews here I went ahead and netflixed Season 1 of The IT Crowd and 5 of the 6 episodes were completely unfunny, some even painfully so. One episode was kinda funny, but the rest were simply terrible, the 3 main actors are really bad actors, no comic timing, relying on yelling to try and make things funny, which does not work. I am a British humor kind of guy but this was not good, maybe if you are an IT nerd or something, but for Brit humor I'd stick with The Office or The Mighty Boosh."
3,It's Ok but Not Quite There,"Publishers must think that once you're over 60 you're not interested in staying current. What about us 70-somethings? Today's ""senior citizens"" don't sit in rocking chairs and let the world go by. We are interested in sharp and beautiful fashion (just please don't show ONLY $200 t-shirts, etc.), skincare, makeup, interesting things to do and learn. This magazine seems to think it's women's answer for all ages....but it misses the mark."
1,not what I expected....,I hope future issues are MORE interesting! Little eye appeal and most of the articles could put you to sleep.
1,Still haven't received it,I still haven't gotten the first magazine so how can I possibly rate the autorenewal? And why on Earth is there a minimum # of words required in a review???
1,product 2 years+ expired upon receipt,"I can understand if a product is very near expired or even very recently expired; however, more than 2 years passed the expiration date (Sept 2009) seems like a violation of FDA regulations, and common decency."
3,the odyssey,"This book was about odysseus and his ten year journey home from troy. Odysseus, a farmer , was called to war because he was the most cunning of all the Greeks. After winning the war, his journey home included a run-in with a cyclops and almost being killed by canibals. It is a short version of the real one so I would recommend this book to those who had to read it."
5,Great chocks,I bought these for my RV and they work just great. I thought at first they might move with the trailer but they stay put. I would recommend rubber chocks.
4,I hungered for more after first listening.....,"The songs were truly rare, classic old school groove sound. Not ""top 10"" items, just music that shakes your memory and revives the lost soul within you from beginning to end. It is one of the best compilations in comparison to other series. Put vol. 2 in my collection."
4,"Love the socks, lousy vendor!","These are terrific socks, have purchased the walking, running and hiking styles. But as in previous reviews, whoever is pulling orders makes a LOT of mistakes! I had to return/reorder three times for one pair! Amazon has been a dream in trying to resolve the issue but unless they have can review the orders themselves, we the customers are stuck! So order early in case there is a problem...."
5,Thorlos Are The Best,"I have used these socks for hiking around our high desert and mountain areas since 2006. When my last pair wore out, I was pleased to find them on Amazon.These are my favorite socks for hiking the local trails. The moisture- wicking technology keeps my feet relatively dry and the cushioning helps in preventing blisters."
1,PURE GARBAGE!,"No one disagrees with the fact that reading fairy tales to children can teach them valuable life lessons. That is where Bettelheim should have stopped when writing this book. His ultra-Freudian persuasion leads him way off course with this work. The sexually explicit meanings he claims young children can identify in fairy tales is nothing short of ridiculous. If it were, the Brothers' Grimm and other writers of fairy tales should have been imprisoned for providing pornography to children!"
5,Rose Tree Symphony Comforter Set,Top of the line bedding ensemble. I was delighted with the close to $100.00 saved on the set.
4,Fast and Easy Setup,"I bought this external HD a few days ago and finally got around to installing it. The disk was easy to follow, just have to plug it in and run the disk, answer some questions and it is all setup and ready to go, without a reboot. It runs quiet and gets warm, but not hot when running all day. I have set it up so the wireless computers in my office can connect to it through our wireless router. It does have a small lag time while accessing the files, but that is normal.Comes with some nice backup software so you can keep everything safe and protected."
5,"A Sequel to Jane Austen's ""EMMA""","Ever wonder what became of Mr. Weston, yes he married poor Miss Taylor. But did they have any children? Yes! and her name is Celia.This is a sequel to Jane Austen's book ""Emma,"" and takes place about 18 years later. This book does not mention all the characters from Emma, including Emma herself. This book is about the Westons and Churchills.Celia is 18 and now motherless, during summer she comes across new acquaitences and is reintroduced to her half brothers family (Frank Churchill). In this books some characters are spiteful, some deceitful, and others just secretive. It was not an uneventful summer! I recommend this book for people who adored the characters from Emma and want to take a trip back into Highbury.The only thing I found displeasing in this book is that sometimes the writing was not making sense. I feel that a better editing job was needed. But it did not take away from the pleasure of reading this book."
5,Great For Kids,"Fast shipping, a little high price but very durable. Gives off a very soft calming light. My daughter loves her new night lights."
5,Another excellent graphic novel by Jeph Loeb/Tim Sale,"Just like Loeb/Sale's ""Batman: Long Halloween"" and ""Batman: Dark Victory"", ""Batman: Haunted Knight"" is another holiday themed graphic novel. It is a trio of short stories which are nothing short of amazing. In the first story, Scarecrow is prowling about Gotham on Halloween night. The second story is based around the Mad Hatter and his obsession with Lewis Carrol's ""Alice and Wonderland"". Finally, the third story is a batman christmas carrolesque story in which batman learns a life lesson from three spirits who take the form of people who have greatly influenced him throughout his years. ((Note: the final story is clearly meant to be like Charles Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol"". At the beginning of the graphic novel it says ""Ghosts based on a christmas carol""))The artwork by Sale is amazing and as always, Loeb continues to prove he knows how to tell a great story."
2,Technical Difficulties,"This is not a review of the book itself, but I don't know where else to put a complaint. The preview function for this book, The Long Halloween, and several other graphic novels are defective. Most of the pages shown are blank and gray. Only a few pages have fragments of word balloons and patches of white. The publisher should either rescan the pages or remove the misleading ""look inside the book"" tag."
3,Good but not their best,"Good book with amazing visuals. This was the first Loeb/Sale graphic novel I purchased and really got me back into comic books in general. One thing that might turn readers off is that it isn't a flowing story but rather broken up individual stories. The first deals with Batman/Bruce battling Scarecrow and his fear toxin, the second has Barbara Gordon kidnapped by Mad Hatter, and the third is a play off of Dicken's Christmas Carol centered on Bruce. Another turn off is that Joker is hardly featured. This serves as a good intro to Loeb and Sale's styles but since it is a one-shot, I would pick up The Long Halloween first and then come back to this later."
3,Spellbinding!,"Jeph Loeb & Tim Sale return in this Batman Saga which features three separate short stories involving Scarecrow, The Mad Hatter & The Penguin and pushes Batman to his limits!"
3,The material is good but did not like the style of this book,"This is one of the three books I bought to prepare myself for the Citizenship Test.It is outdated (the edition I received is 2 years old) and lack information on recent events in American and World History.The tone of this book reminds me a conversation with a lawyer. Boring, too stylish, and not very friend English.I really liked - although the edition I receive was 3 years old - ""U.S. Citizenship For Dummies"", it is more fun and easy to read and learn."
5,Gilligan's Island Season 1,"I have been watching Gilligan's Island for many years, and although I have seen all the episodes, I am never tired of watching an episode one more time. Every time I watch Gilligan's Isle I laugh a lot, because each and every episode is so funny. I love comedies, and this certainly is one. I really recomend it to anyone who is a lover of comedy. Although the episodes were made a while ago, I love to watch them. They can be family movies, or movies you watch while doing something else - you can watch them in any situation. I can't wait until I buy the next 2 seasons of Gilligan's Island, and I recomend them as well."
5,great for kids,"Finally, something that I can put my kids in front of without worrying about sex, drugs, killing or anything else that seems to dominate TV these days. I loved Gilligan's Island as a kid and this not only brings back fond memories for me, but helps us create new ones as a family.Now if they would only come out with Seasons 2 and 3...."
4,Fun for young and old with the goofy castaways,It`s been well over 40 years since the nutty castaways found theirselves on Gilligan`s Island and they are still as funny todayas they were back then. This show is timeless and there really isn`t much higher praise you can throw at a tv comedy than thatit has stood the test of time.
4,Gilligan's Island: Complete Series Collection Review,I was very pleased with this product. It took a while to get here but it was well worth the wait. I actually gave it as a gift and the person I gave it to was very happy about it. They watch it all the time and I have yet to hear any complaints about it. I was really happy with this purchase.
5,Great family entertainment,"We subsribed to Deja View on our cable network and my son (who's 10)seen a couple episodes of of Gilligan's Island. He thought it was such a great show, I surprised him by buying the first season. Now that's our evening entertainment, after supper we watch one or two shows before bed. He's 10 and thinks it's so much better than most of the shows on right now. I think he enjoys singing the theme as much as watching the show. It's great for myself as a parent to know they're watching something that's meant for family viewing. I have to admit I also enjoy watching the old shows - it's like comfort food!"
2,missing episode,we love these shows but for some reason episode 33 'its majic' gets skipped over in the 1st season. we tried it in our other players and it still skips right over it. anyone else have this problem?
5,The best!!!!,"I'm going to keep this short. If you are a Gilligan's Island fan,which you probably are otherwise you wouldn't be reading this, then why haven't you already bought this set?! Just go get it!"
4,Gilligans Island DVD set,This collection is TERRIFIC - right from the start this show was hilarious... so cute in its innocence and a great family watch.
4,gi 1 is #1 of this 3 set,most eps r better than others or this would be 5 stars; wish it was the colorized version cuz it looks better-more adventurous and cuz one can always set their color setting to o otherwise. this set seems a lil more to realism than the others and a lil more refreshing and relaxing. i like the island scenery clips but that could have been a lil more and longer. it does have the most eps per set of these 3 sets.
2,book,"Type a bit pushed together hard to read, paper not high quality but its a long book...a re-printing would be a good idea with a real hardcover look thsi one says hard cover but its basically an over sized paperback."
5,One of the top ten books I've ever read,"This is one of the best books I've ever read--fascinating man Peter, who lived in an exotic world in a time whose customs are vastly different from ours. It's all told in a highly readable style. Loved the diversions into Peter's world. So many remarkable stories in this book. I knew almost nothing about Peter beforehand, so that made it even better. Am on a Massie tear now...his other books are coming my way."
3,Everything you ever wanted to know about Peter the Great....and then some.,"Having read other books by this author, I was really looking forward to ""losing myself"" in Peter The Great. I normally read 3 or 4 books a week. I'm on week 3, I believe, of this 880 page biography. Part of the issue may be that I'm not so much interested in military history as others may be so the material on the great northern war has been very slow going. Considering the fact that this war lasted approximately 20 years, there's a great deal of information regarding it. This is definitely a definitive history of Peter and his exploits but, at page 753, I've only gotten glimpses of his personality and motivations. All in all, I'm glad I read it and have learned alot but it hasn't been as enjoyable an experience as I would have liked."
5,A Book as Epic as the History,"Currently through part 3 of 5, this is by no means a short book. However, if you have some time to spare and find Russia and the 17th-18th century world interesting, this book gives an excellent insight not only into the evolution of Russia under Peter, but also the world in which he lived. This book has been nothing short of superbly written and full of information. Once again, just as a warning, this is a very long book. You won't be able to put it down, expect to spend many hours poring over the information contained!"
4,Peter the Great,"Pro: Well written account of perhaps the most significant of all the Russian czars. This book makes it easier to understand some of the peculiarities of modern Russia. Although he seems to have had tunnel vision, one can see why Peter was called ""The Great"".Con: As an ex soldier and artilleryman, I found some of the author's details regarding weapons to be less than accurate. Also, in places, he seemed to have been writing with a total word-count in mind.All things considered: Very good."
2,The whoopie cushion is the best part,"I'm sure kids find these books hilarious. I find them mildly amusing (especially the whoopie cushion), but I also find them troubling. I like the premise -- two kids writing their own comic books, their principal turning into an underwear-clad superhero -- but what bothers me is that in the kids' comic strips, the author has purposely misspelled dozens of words, as if ignorant children have written the captions. For the adults this is cute, but for the children who read these cartoons over and over again these misspellings will become fatally etched in their memories. Spare us the cutesy backward letters, Mr. Pilkey, and help children learn how to spell."
3,Eh.. Just eh...,"I would give this movie a 2.5 if I could. I had heard such amazing about this movie and when I finally got to watch it, I thought it was a mediocre film that tried too hard to be shocking and disturbing. I understand that the budget wasn't the best and with that in mind the graphics weren't horrible but just the feel during the movie and how predictable everything was I thought it was sub-par in the genre.The film started out amazingly and as it kept going I kept thinking that it was just getting more and more ridiculous as it kept progressing. When I got to the ending I thought it was a cheap attempt at trying to rekindle the success of the saw series. You'll squirm at first but half way through the movie you're desensitized. It's an ok concept, just not great execution."
5,good,I was very satisfied with this product. the description of the item was a very accurate one. i love it
4,Great player,"Great picture. Easy to use. Embedded speakers are a little weak, but are fine considering the compact size of the overall unit. Comes with power cords for both home and car - a real plus."
4,"1977, y'all! 19-freakin'-77...and still kicks butt.","""I Hate the Rich"", ""Class War"" and ""You're Not a Blank"" are three of the greatest punk songs of all time. Rest of this compilation CD isn't as great, so save yourself some bucks if you want and just buy the mp3's of those three tracks.The Dils were (are) one of the most under-rated punk bands from the early punk era. People forget that this stuff was released BEFORE ""Nevermind the Bollocks.""And the themes are as relevant today, 32 freakin' years later, as they were in 1977.All these so-called punk bands from the '90's and 2000's are SO weak in comparison, just recycling riffs and sounds pioneered by bands like The Dils 10-15 years before they were born. Hilarious and pathetic."
1,not what I thought it was,"I thought this was a cd of him coving the songs listed, but instead, it was a compilation of songs he liked. Although I liked the music, I was disappointed it was not him."
3,an alright video for its time,"This video is alright considering when it was made. It has lots of big names in it like tom penny, sean sheffey, and, yes, the poser favorite, Muska, but still it feels like there is something missing. It's probably that the skaters dont have long enough footage or sequences or something, but you'll see that after you watch it, it will make you feel kind of cheated for some reason. weird."
3,cd purchase review,disc holder was cracked upon delivery. cd itself is fine but I was not satisfied with condition of disc holder.
3,Three Classics Out Of Seven,"This was the beginning of the ""elevator"" music period for Steely Dan. ""Black Cow"", ""Deacon Blues"" and ""Josie"" are the only really strong tracks here. The rest has an overly mellow and listless sound. Not the weakest album overall - Gaucho is much worse - but everything before this is MUCH stronger."
5,A Timeless Classic,"In a time when hard rock and funk were running the show, somthing came from the mind of Donald Faegan and Walter Becker that is now a classic. From ""Black Cow"" to ""Josie"" Steely Dan's AJA is a soothing blend of rock and jazz infusion that come together to make somthing unmatched by any other album. One has to think what kind of geniuses were able to fit so much greatness into only the seven songs that are on AJA. Starting with ""Black Cow"", a song that could easily be mistaken as disco until Faegans relaxing soulful voice enters. ""Deacon Blues"" has some of the best song writing of any Steely Dan songs ever. ""Peg"" is a song about a famous girl, and it is just really fun. ""Josie"" is a song that can put you to sleep throught its relaxation yet get your toe tapping through it's beat at the same time. If you are ever wondering what one album from 1970's you should get, make sure it is Steely Dan's AJA."
4,"What A ""Thrill""...","The best thing I can say about pop music is that albums like ""Aja"" make you wish that I was there in the studio with the artists. This album is a great classic. It's smooth, hip, cool, and and jazzy. ""Peg"" is simply upbeat, while ""Home At Last"" sounds as if Fagen and Becker were trying to ""get funky"". I never paid much attention to Steely Dan during the 70's, due to the fact that I was ""caught up"" in the Bee Gees. The only introduction to ""Aja"" and other Steely Dan albums I received, was due mostly, to a very attractive woman, and a rock encyclopedia. . ""Aja"" became a part of our ""horizontal routine."""
5,Steely Dan - Aja,"Simply a must have for anyone appreciative of the soulful, jazzy, pop rock style and smooth lyrics of Steely Dan. This project employed some of the best musicians of their era, a who's who in the industry. Black Cow will have you wanting to sing along with the track. Steve Gadd's drum solo on Aja (track 2) provides an unprecedented transistion from the stylishly smooth groove to the high energy ending. Deacon Blues epitimizes the style that provided Steely Dan a world-wide following. Proceeded by Peg, Home At Last, I Got The News, and Josie; anyone missing out on this project is losing out on a piece of history. A collector's must have item.Sherman Wright"
5,Musicianship Wins Every Time,"By far - the best Steely Dan album of them all.Great songwriting combined with a who's-who list of some of the finest musicains of their era equals a classic that will be played and played by every generation that has an ear for musicianship at it's highest level.Witty, humorous, cutting, biting, sarcastic, jazzy, funky, rocking.Aja is all of that and more.This album finds ""a groove"" beginning with the opening track and never wavers.An often overlooked classic that should be in every collection."
4,Great Film for English Classes,I am an 11th greade English teacher and I show this film to my students after we read the short story. It is a good way to translate the story into a visual context.
3,Objectivity compromised,"You cannot understand the Revolutionary War without an understanding of the South and to comprehend the South is to know something of Tarlton. This is a well-researched, well-written effort with very detailed footnotes. The author attempts to tread that fine line of admitting Tarlton believed in hard war but somehow asks us to believe i.e. ""he was not that bad."" He hated the Whig, absorbed the bitterness of northern tories whom he led, and fought without any compassion even in those clear circumstances where it would have been more effective. What I now understand better is how Tarlton's harshness may have snatched defeat from the jaws of victory. Morgan's triumph at Cowpens is all the more remarkable.Tarlton was a nasty little man who was very lucky he did not fall into patriot hands. I recommend the book. The obvious comparisons to Sherman and Grant are dead on!! The author's bias is too transparent to be much of an encumberance."
2,Cute for display but not functional,"This chair was a booger to put together. It looks reallly cute sitting in the utility room, hiding our hot water heater. I got the yellow one and my front loaders are the ocean blue color. It isn't sturdy at all and I'd be afraid for anyone to really use it."
1,"retro look, but not retro quality","I'm disappointed with this stepstool. The seat has a warning to not use it for standing upon, and the steps are too narrow even for my small feet. Also, the way the steps store leaves them feeling shaky when I try to stand on them. On the positive side, the color is nice."
2,Purchase of retro kitchen stool,"The parts that were in the box arrived in good condition. However, two side supports are missing. We aren't able to finish assembling the stool. Do I report this to Amazon or contact the company?"
4,Bought as a joke,I bought this bus as a joke for Christmas. This was part of a long running joke between a friend and I. As for the bus it came when it was supposed to and fit the exact description. Since it was for an adult I cannot speak as to the value of it actually being played with though.
2,amateur,"I am so sorry I bought this. It's just a couple of guys who video taped themselves on a ride. Seriously, very amateur in quality and expertise."
5,Cheaper elsewhere,"There is nothing I can say about Collective Efforts and their work that hasn't already been said here, so I'll let all the other reviews speak for this album.If your looking to pick up this album go to ugrecordings (search for it or it's on cecrews website under merchandise store). You can get all 3 of their latest releases (including this one) plus a t-shirt and poster for less than what most sellers on here are charging for just this album used. Plus you'll be supporting the artist directly and not these outlandish prices."
2,adaptation of Checkov?,It doesn't take Mamet to know that classical literature doesn't need to be adapted. But it takes Mamet to ignore that dictum. I am sure he doesn't care.
5,I thought the point of writing was to explore . . .,"I like the other reviewers read 'Pi' first. I only have one question: why would anyone expect an amazing writer like Martel to turn out 'Pi' flavoured cookie cutter novels? I, for one, find it quite a refreshing turn that Martel has the depth and creativity to find such different topics to write about with such command.There is no doubt that sex (and quite explicit for that matter) plays an important part in Martel's foray into understanding the dichotomy of humanity. However, he is not covering any unknown territory. If you can read the sexual content as part of the larger context of identity crisis, you will find that Martel is absolutely compelling, even illuminating about human nature.Why should a reader cheer Pi more than the protagonist of 'Self'?"
2,Self Indulgent Beyond Belief,"I am a Canadian living in Los Angeles and had read Martel's earlier books of short stories which don't seem to be available here. I enjoyed them and looked forward to reading a full novel from him. I was gravely disappointed. Martel seems to think very highly of himself and it comes through in the writing. Stick to short stories, Mr. Martel, and try to return to reality."
5,Attacking the fibre of society on the dancefloor,"From what I've read this is a return to form for Primal Scream. This album being my initiation to the band, I have no foundation from which to launch an opinion on *that* topic. However, in regards to this album: it is one of the best albums of the new millenium, hands down. There's a reason why the artwork for the album is military in style. The mission of this record is to attack whatever notion of music, dance or otherwise, you had, completly destroy it, and then rebuild your beliefs from the ground up. The album as a whole sounds like a war, albeit a pleasant sounding one that you can carry on the dancefloor. You'll shake your booty with ""Kill all Hippies,"" ""Accelerator"" (which was seemingly recorded in a metsl trash can), ""Swastika Eyes"" and ""Keep Your Dreams,"" and at the end you can bet your vision of music of 21st Century music will be nearly parallel with Bobby Gillespie's."
1,Too much whining,"Waterman spends most of the book whining. The three main threads of his complaint are the ecological devastation, how the native peoples were taken advantage of by the various colonizers, and how his one year old marriage seems to be on the rocks. When he talks about the stark beauty of the land, it is always in the same breath with how badly the place is getting ruined.I read the book when I was in Baja California Sur in May, 2003. The place was beautiful, the weather was great and the people were extremely friendly. The book's doomsday predictions were very much out of whack with the reality."
5,great product !!!,WE purchased this for my daughter....and we could not be happier...Its top quality and even her band director praises the sound she gets now. Its the best mouthpiece you can buy and well worth teh $$$$
2,Too much drama,"The stories are interesting enough, but there is far too much time-wasting artificial drama, with endless interviews. If they kicked it down a notch, and edited it down by 50%, it would be great. The trainer himself is great."
2,DVD,"Not impressed with the DVD as it is for Regin 1, I am not able to watch it, so I will not buy any more."
1,the very best of the dog whisperer,"I cannot play this cd in the Republic of Ireland, so it is of no use to me.I am so disappointed."
1,This is simply a taped TV Show - not training video,"This is nothing but a taped TV show - not a 'training video.' Being Cesar fans, we've seen these episodes on the show."
3,Package arrived cracked,"The item arrived, and it is as it is described, but the plastic was coming unglued from the cardboard, and it was cracked. No biggy, really, but it is a gift and I wanted to make sure it looked new!"
2,Mostly nostalgia,"I expected something a little more interesting from Shirley Jackson, author of the classic horror stories ""The Lottery"" and ""The Haunting of Hill House."" This is a book June Cleaver could have written if she'd had Jackson's facility with the English language. The stories about Jackson's children and her trials with her old home are charming, but the overall effect is achingly dated. Was there really a time, not so long ago, when women cared deeply about whether they served coffee in mugs or demitasse cups? If so, hurrah for women's lib.This book is good for nostalgia, if you want to remember a time when moms stayed home with their kids, couples played bridge, and the most rascally thing a kid could do was throw rocks at the neighbor's boy."
4,On the other side...in the midst of reading these books:,"It's wierd to read this after ""the Lottery,"" etc....I keep waiting for something, anything, to go bump.This is a story of her four children and some of their adventures. Though I'm told that these two books were only based on fact, they are still an entertaining read. I felt like I'm reading the most untragic book,""Adventures of Shirley Jackson, Housewife""....Her horror stories are full of big and little nightmares; to me these two stories are like a day-trip."
3,"Good, But Inconsistent","Let me start by saying that this album's title track (a righteous guitar grind accompanied by a pounding rhythym section and Ozzy's insane wail) ranks among Sabbath's best songs. Even Tony Iommi has admitted that he belives that tune to be Sabbath's finest. Although I wouldn't quite go that far, it certainly is good.The rest of the album, unfortunately, pales in comparison. Sabbra Cadabra, Killing Yourself To Live, and A National Acrobat are decent, but nothing special. Fluff seems like a directionless imitation of Vol. 4's Laguna Sunrise, and Spiral Architect is too light and airy to make a lasting impression.This is not to say that Sabbath Bloody Sabbath is a bad album; the band's playing is still tight and Ozzy's vocals remain powerful and inspired. It's just not up to par with any of Sabbath's previous releases or the following album, Sabotage."
5,The 5th masterpiece by Black Sabbath,Another superb masterpiece. All the songs are really great and the way that ozzy sings is amazing. You can remember the lyrics .The music is easy - listening heavy metal that can be listened any time. A national acrobat - Sabra cadabra and Sabbath bloody Sabbath are <<the something else>> . Personally i like all the songs. I recommend this album to ALL metal fans.
1,We Were the Mulvaneys,"I like to read. Really!! But this? I'm halfway through and more than once I thought: why bother? Once you start skipping passages because they're tedious, boring, and you're wondering ""is this relevent?"" perhaps it is time to walk away. At each chapter I wonder: who's head am I in now (who's point of view)? Ms. Oates has written 30 books? Perhaps she shouldn't crank them out this fast, or perhaps her editor needs more courage, or perhaps Ms. Oates needs a better editor! Despite the ""compelling ties of love"" this story is supposed to have, I haven't seen anything unusual -- no characters that grip my interest, nor a compelling strive to find out more. I gave it one star--after all, it's a lot of pages..."
1,Never again...,"As an English teacher, I've read several of Oates' novels and have always been disappointed. I had hoped that this experience would be different. Not only is the book too wordy, but the entire story was a disappointment. There are so many other great books out there about dysfunctional families that this one pales by comparison. I can't imagine any family as close as the Mulvaney's are at the beginning of the story reacting to the tragedy like they did, namely Corinne and Michael, Sr. Truly loving parents stand by their children especially after a tragedy like Marianne suffered. The other major complaint I have is that it reads like a Russian novel... every character has at least one nickname and sometimes two! This novel could have been edited down to half its size and still have gotten the message across."
5,An Intense Novel That Kept Me Reading,"First of all, I read this book during my move from one apartment to another. Why am I telling you this? Because I had to take breaks between packing and hauling just to read. I couldn't put the book down. Joyce Carol Oates has a way of revealing situations by the use of detail that will keep you turning the page. For example, if a girl gets raped, the author will not simply state the fact blatantly, but rather let the character's actions speak for themselves. This is her best skill. Also, the characters become so real and human, I can't see how anyone couldn't idenify with them. I felt everything, which says something about the book. And I really don't think 3 stars does this book any justice. It's simply fantastic."
1,Hoping for much more,"When I opened the book I was very excited to start reading this book. I was quickly bored and found myself struggling through it. There were few parts when I was intrigued and happy I stuck it out, but I was bored shortly after that. I wasn't a fan of the writing style, which didn't help much. I did find the family dynamics and how the events played out interesting, but it was lacking a hold power for. I was pretty disappointed in this book."
4,"Intriguing, Yet Slow","I was introduced to this book by a friend, who described it to me as this great book. Indeed, it was really good, but I found it to be a little slow at times. It had a good plot line with well detailed events, but the book could have had a lot of information deleted. I found myself skipping paragraphs, even pages at a time. I prefer to read books that have event after event and so on, but this book didn't have that kind of plot. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the book and would recommend it to others. It shares a good story of life and the tragic things that happen to the good people. Just with a lot of extra details."
5,I wish I could give it 6 stars,"This is one of the best books I've ever read. Oates really makes you care about the Mulvaneys; you start to think these are real people, not fictional characters. You feel for them even as you get angry at what they do to each other and to themselves. I'm so glad I read this book! If you haven't read it, buy it now! You won't be disappointed."
2,What a Snoozer!,"This book was so disappointing. Putting the shoddy grammatical and spelling errors aside, (did anyone proofread the text before it went to press?) the story is quite disappointing. The author describes things that we really have no need to know about - and does it at inappropriate times of the story. We don't care what color the ceiling was when Marianne was three. Give us a break! The ending is absolutely stupid.Never has so much been written about so little.Do yourself a favor and skip this Oprah book - you'll enjoy ""House of Sand and Fog"" or ""Drowning Ruth"" much more."
2,Poked Along,"My first time to read Ms. Oates, and unforunately, I was rather disappointed. The story when on forever, the plot lines when all over the place and I never felt much compassion for any member of the Mulvaney family. Way too much description and not enough detail in story content."
1,First book I've read of Oates and now my last.,"I could just repeat some of the other one star reviews. This was the first book I've read by Joyce Carol Oates and I probably would not have read it if it had not been recommended by a ""friend"". It was one of the most tedious books I have read. I felt that the characters were shallow, that there was practically no wisdom or perception in the book and I have to say I found myself aghast that the father would reject his daughter, supposedly the apple of his eye, because she had been raped. I'm sure Ms Oates is very talented and has much better but with so many Pulitzer Prize and Nobel prize winning authors out there, it's highly doubtful I will read anything else of hers."
1,Infuriating!,What a horrible book. I have to finish any book that I pick up but I almost didn't make it through this one. What was Oprah thinking? I wish I had seen her show when they discussed it because I truly want to find something redeeming. What a waste of time - I could have been reading a good book!
2,Why did I finish this book?,"I'd heard great things about this book from many different types of people, so maybe my expectations were set a bit high to begin with. But goodness! Talk about a depressing story! And it's not even one that really keeps you locked in. I plowed through it just hoping that I'd find out why people had recommended this to me, and never quite figured it out. I didn't believe in the characters' reactions to the events that occurred, or feel emphathetic to their situations...at all. I had more of a ""oh, give me a break"" type reaction from chapter to chapter. Read this book if for some reason you need a downer, because this will definitely do it for you."
2,Monster - Walter Dean Myers - By: Lisa Mills,"In Monster, sixteen-year old Steve Harmon is in prison for his alleged involvement in a murder. Wanting to be a screenwriter, Steve dictates much of the novel in the form of a screenplay. Like many of Myers' works, this novel is set in Harlem. Themes focus on fear, violence, decision-making, family relationships, and morality. Interestingly, Myers conducted approximately 600 pages of interviews with imprisoned youths prior to writing Monster. In the novel, Steve Harmon never confesses to the crime. However, he cannot write anything in the novel that might suggest his involvement, since the prosecutor might use this information against him. Throughout the book, Steve's primary focus is being released from prison by whatever means necessary. Is this wish granted? Read the novel and find out!"
3,it was ok,i wouldn't read it again. or for that matter recommend it to anyone because it was sort of boring. it was really slow.
4,I have mixed feelings....,"I have mixed feeling about this book.I loved it and I hated it! The story is about a close family falling apart because of a terrible thing that happened to their only daughter.It was a pretty slow book , and really detailed, but this was not all a bad thing. I thought the fact that it was so detailed helped you to get to know the charaters. I had a love/hate relationship with the characters of this book. I felt for some of the characters, while other i was just wanted to yell ""your so Stupid!!!"". I recommend this book is you enjoy books that and detailed, but if you need a fast action plot this is not the book for you. but in my opinion everyone should give this book a chance i think its a very worth while read."
1,Very difficult to hold my interest,"I found it very difficult to read this book. Usually when reading a book, I can identify with, or LIKE, at least one character. In this book, there was no one! The parents were self-righteous and cold, the brothers were too involved and selfish to care about their sister, except for how the episode affected them, and I lost all respect for the sister, when she would not admit to what happened to her. I felt that she should have thought about any other women he might hurt in the future, and tried to protect them. Like everyone else in her family, she only thought about herself. I have really enjoyed each Oprah book I have read, but this one disturbed me. For the first time in my life, I quickly skimmed through the book after the first 100 pages, and I was able to pick up the storyline! I wish I would have bought another book."
2,It took way too long to read this book,"Like the title says, it took me forever to read this book. The only time I picked it up was when I had nothing else better to do! This was an incredibly long book that failed to keep my interest. The author writes from the point of view of the youngest son, but fails to really capture anyone but himself and the sister. Hardly any detail was given to any of the other characters in the book. I was definetly disappointed with this being an ""Oprah"" book, as most of her selections I like."
3,Another Slow Paced Oprah Pick,"Oprah picks generally have rich characters, but a slow pace. In We Were The Mulvaneys, however, some of the intriguing characters do things that seem completely incongruous when they ostracize their beautiful, popular, teenaged daughter because she was the victim of a crime. It doesn't ring true. Ms. Oats has a lot of talent, but this book was depressing."
1,IF ONLY I HAD KNOWN.....,"...Creative writing cliches,psuedo-Hollywoodian routines, and an irritating penchant for showing off make this so-called novel hard to bear. Had I known ... I would have fled from it a thousand miles. Alas, I didn't know. A READER IN LONDON"
2,too cluttered,"Okay, I will be the odd person and admit that I did not care for the book. I found the text to be too choppy and disjointed. On more than one occasion, I was confused as to what exactly was going on in the story. Finally, after struggling to get at least half way through the book, I flipped through the remainder just to find out what the heck was going on. I love most of Oprah's list but this is one of those few that I wish I had not purchased or wasted time on..........."
2,[Spoilers] Reading this is like being dragged through sludge,"....then suddenly hosed off and set out in the sun. This is a profoundly depressing story with an unbelievably happy ending.Lots of unexplained changes of character in the characters. Why did such an apparently ideal father and all-around nice guy suddenly banish his beloved daughter from his home and life? Why did such a caring mother let him do it? How did a highly focused, introverted, antisocial boy-genuis become a therapist and loving family man? It seems like there might be several missing chapters in this story.I will give the author credit for developing a wonderful sense of place. I felt like I knew that farm, and the selling and leaving of it was believable enough.Every time I read one of JCO's novels, I promise myself never to do it again. And I've done it again!"
2,Slow moving - not believable book,"This book is filled with unessasary bulk... It just goes on and on with too much description of things that are not even important to the story line. Then when things finally start to get interesting the pointless descriptions come back. I wanted to skim through most of this book. If the author took all of that extra ""stuff"" out it might not be half bad except for the fact that it is not very believable. At the beginning the author builds up the characters to be one way and by the middle they are suddenly completely different. If you can put all of this aside, the book does have its moments and you can occasionally get into it (although it can be very depressing and frustrating). Overall I would say this book is worth reading if you like books that take a while to get into and if you are willing to look past the unbelievable characters."
2,We Were The Mulvaney's,"I personally didn't care for the book. It is a very slow read and took me forever to read it as i could not get into it. Not one of the finest books for Oprah to put in her book club.This book was about a family who was torn apart based on something tragic that happened to one of the family members. It is about betrayal, loyalty and mistrust. The story unfolds as Oates writes about what happens to the family in the years after the tragedy. The family, in my opinion, is very strange and did not react the way that a normal family would react."
3,Emotionally exhausting,"This book had me hooked, but by the time I made to the end I was sooo depressed. It wasn't enjoyable to read, but I felt compelled to finish it to find out what happened to this tragic family. Even though the ending was supposed to be uplifting, I couldn't shake the feeling of melancholy that had pervaded the entire book."
2,Not my cup of tea,"I think this was one of those books that you either loved or hated, and I definitely did not love it. I just found the family so despicable in their handling of such a delicate situation, and although I'm sure this kind of thing happens far more often than we'd like to believe, that doesn't make it any easier to take. In my opinion, it started off well, and then just dragged incessantly once I got halfway through it. So it wasn't just the subject matter - if the writing had been different, I would have found it much more palatable. I'm sorry I bought it."
5,WOW--Intensely Absorbing,"This book is one that I had a hard time putting down. I think I found it so engaging because its characters are people we all know well--the stereotypical ""perfect"" family (and let's face it, every community has one). It looks beyond the veneer of this perfection into some very real, imperfect situations. When things go spinning out of control, it shows how pride and reputation can override sanity and better judgement. The characters are rich, their individual plights absorbing, and their survival instincts amazing. A dark tale, I wasn't depressed by the story. I focused on Marianne's strength, and used her resiliance as the metaphor for what the other characters strived to be."
2,Ahhhh Come Onnnnnnnn!!!,"Oates is brilliant for the most part but this book made me wonder! The Muvaneys are about as unrealistic as they can get! Oates' elaborate descriptions of Marianne's mother baking pies, pies and more pies in such detail emphasizing the ""perfect"" family is less than perfect and borders on obnoxious hyperbole!It is true the storyline is one of the devastation of date rape; she overemphasizes the ""cutesiness"" and later the unraveling of this upstate New York family as the book progresses. The ultimate ending is nearly laughable! I threw it across the room!"
2,Too long and frustrating,"I found this book very disappointing. I normally like Oprah's books, but I found this one felt like it was just going on and on. I never ""bonded"" with any of the characters and by the end I really didnt care what happened to any of them. I felt each person was terribly weak and self-centered."
1,Implausible and boring,"The downfall of the Mulvaneys, after Oates' careful, exacting, boring description of them up to this point, was implausible, unbelievable. The parents she had described would just simply not treat their children, especially Marianne, the way they end up treating them. Seemed very naive. Has Oates had children of her own? The way she writes of the parents turning away from their children one by one makes it seem that she knows little of this bond. I would not recommend this book to anyone, and will be choosier henceforth and not as willing to read an Oprah selection just because it is an Oprah selection."
4,A strong work about relationships and tragedies,"Not having read a book by this author since high-school, I was startled by how much I was enthralled by this strory of the breakup of one family. Oates paints such a vivid picture of the torment and dissociation each family member feels while all around them their lives are being destroyed. Even more overwhelming is what doesn't get said and how this contributes to the family's demise.We are given an intimate look into the psyche of each member of this family and though we may not always like whom we meet, we feel compelled to find some goodness in all. I recommend this book to all, especially those who believe that ""it"" can't happen to them"
4,A modern American classic,"This book should be listed as a modern American classic and Ms Oates as one of the finest contemporary writers of fiction. It is a superbly written piece that it going to keep me pondering and thinking for weeks to come. A tragic tale of a family's elevated perception of itself and its inability to deal with any event that strays from the ordinary. I am sure that if I read this again in a few year's time, I will find even more within its pages."
4,Poignantly True-to-life,"As a member of the graduating class of 1976 (like Patrick Mulvaney) I feel that this story brilliantly portrays characters of that ""era"", as well as prevalent attitudes of society in general during the 70's and 80's. The Mulvaney's inability to cope with the tragedies which befall them, and their tendency to ""sweep it under the rug"" was so typical then. I am grateful that our society now is much more open and supportive of those whose lives are touched by such grievous problems as rape and alcoholism. I loved this book, and recommend it wholeheartedly."
3,We were the Mulvaneys,"This is the story of a dysfunctional family faced with a crisis that causes the family to fall apart. It shows how societal expectations, coupled with status, play a factor in the disunity and eventual demise of a family, hence the word 'were' in the title. It is a tragic injustice to a young rape victim who has only one person, a brother who stands with her, though silently except for one action."
3,A long days journey into a family's problems,"While the actions of the father in this novel may seem bizarre by today's standards, the time in which the story takes place was one in which very different attitudes prevailed. Generally, I appreciate vivid and detailed description in literature, but in this case, I do feel Oates takes it to an extreme for many readers. On the other hand, it is up to the reader to decide whether or not to read every single word or to pass by the descriptive pages that are not immediately essential to the understanding of the story and the motivations of the characters. The value of this book is totally in the eyes of the reader and his or her ability to identify with the characters on any level. My response to this novel was mixed. I found much of it too predictable. The author gave some things away that could have been foreshadowed more subtly."
3,Say What?,"As a first year college student, I found Beloved to be a very difficult book to read under time restrictions. To fully appreciate this novel one must be willing to read it numerous times. The content itself was excellent and I found the plot of the story to be very interesting. The story forces the reader to ask theirself many questions with no concete answers. Make sure to pay close attention for the flashbacks, they can really come out of left field."
1,ZERO STAR. TOTALLY BAD,"I guess if you are Toni Morrison, you can submit a pathetic piece of writing and call it a novel and still people will go to great length to qualify your work as a masterpiece, a must read, even select it for some of the highest awards. This is snobbishness at its best.....and I say poppycock to all this!! And shame on Oprah for pushing this book...I realize that friendship has its demands but one should also know what the limits are!! That being said, I truly feel that it is regrettable for our society that this important episode in the history of slavery will remain unknown to a large majority due to the complex and largely unaccessible style of this book"
1,I must be stupid....,This book left me very confused and asking a lot of questions. I watched the movie and I was still confused and asking a lot of questions. I JUST DON'T GET IT. I don't think I will read another Toni Morrison book again.
2,sorry.,"i heard toni morrison on mpr today and she seemed like a very nice and intelligent lady. i wished that i liked this book, but it just wasn't for me. i would not bother rating it, if not for the fact that i just heard the new york times picked THIS as the best book of the last 25 years! first of all, there is no such thing as the best book of the last 25 years, or 100 years, or best book overall of anything period. books are way too subjective an experience to make such an outrageous claim. if the new york times wanted to say this is the favorite book of our editorial dept. over the past 25 years, we could all live with that. i, of course, want to love every book i start. i don't have time to pick up books i think i would hate. so i did have high hopes for this book. it just left me puzzled as to why it is getting such over the top praise, i am sorry to say. oh, well. maybe it's just me."
1,Not worth your time,I have loved all of Oprahs picks but this one waes BORING. The authpr has no flow in this book. Just drags on and on--couldn't wait to get to the end. So tired of hearing about s;avery-- why not the plight of Ellis Island emmigrants. Will never read another book by this author--was a horror just to pick up and continue reading. I guess some readers wrote their review because it was Oprah and a moveie. Give us a break Toni Morrison
1,Perhaps A Negative review,"Perhaps those who write negative reviews of Morrison's work are in touch with poor writing. The ""style"" the author displays in this novel has no substance. A quirky, irritating technique fails to hide very bad writing from the perception of the most remedial reader."
2,Not highly recommended for teens,"I read Beloved as an assignment for school and I was left completely confused. The novel, in its entirety, is overpowering and at times I found myself afraid to turn the page for fear of what I may read next. At other times, I had to flip back 5 pages and start sections over again because I was lost. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
1,difficult,I have a very difficult time understanding Toni Morrison's style of writing. Since I could't understand her style I couldn't enjoy the content.I ended up returning it to the library without finishing it because it was horribly over due. I just couldn't bring myself to finish reading it.
2,disappointing and strange,"I expected Beloved to be a stunning, riveting semi-historical fiction about slavery and its aftermath, but it was disappointing in that respect-I don't even consider it a satisfying story because the plot was too wierd and everything just seemed so slapped together. I am of the opinion that ghosts should not be put into a story unless the author can do a superb, subtle job of writing them in, such as in Wuthering Heights-or else the story is simply ridiculous. I have a feeling Oprah is inclined to 5-star and promote any book that presents an emotional tie with slavery no matter what kind of slop it is, so I tend not to trust her!"
3,Liked the book,"Well written with very graphic and emotional messages throughout. Overall, easy to come away with the desperation some people must have felt."
1,NO THANKYOU,"Let me start out saying that I love to read. But this book was so difficult to follow. I had a really hard time getting involved with any of the characters or caring about them. I do not want to have to try that hard to find a flow to the words I am reading. I realize a lot of people loved this book, but not me."
1,Indecent,"Morrison's word choice is excellent. She's obviously a good writer, but truly, her subject matter leaves A LOT to be desired, in this book. Its raunchy beyond belief. People do things with farm animals that they shouldn't. I couldn't get through the first two chapters without vomiting. Some things you just shouldn't put in your head."
2,Had to close it.,"Was enjoying it until Beloved ""strangled"" on a raisin. After a stupid part like that I had to stop reading it. I assumed Miss Morrison meant choked, and how can a full grown woman choke on something as small as a raisin? Who chokes on a raisin? Couldn't she have just said it was an olive or somethin?"
3,Get to the point,"Beloved is a beautifully written novel. Morrison creates beautiful images throughout the entire novel that help the reader to try to understand the emotions of the characters. However, the concept of ""rememory"" and the various flashbacks that occur throughout the novel confuse the reader rather than help them.Every character in the novel is forced to face their pasts at some point in the book. Morrison demonstrates this by strategically placing flashbacks throughout the book. Although the flashbacks do provide some insight into the life of the characters, they confuse the reader and force the reader to piece together the puzzle of Beloved themselves. Morrison should have written the novel in chronological order to help readers understand her concepts.Despite the fact that Beloved is quite confusing, I still give it three stars. Morrison is quite good at her craft, as her complex plot kept me interested in the novel. I would reccommend the novel to others."
2,Not worth finishing...,"I was very disappointed with Morrison's ""Beloved"". Granted, there were several creative lyrical phrases scattered among the disjointed paragraphs and strange plot lines, but the work as a whole wasn't worth finishing. Read an online summary if you want to, but find something better that isn't a waste of your valuable reading time. It is disturbing when a book is praised falsely. Don't be fooled by the hype."
5,"Painful, but worth it.","This is one of the more disturbing novels that I've read. A ghost story. Such loss, pain and resolve. Take the time to read it. It's worth putting thought into a horrific period in our history."
2,What a load of hype!,"Unfortunately, though I gave this book two attempts with a years interval, I still couldn't finish it! I'd heard the hype and was hoping to discover something extraordinary but was totally underwhelmed in the end.There are definately some disturbing images and some quite beautiful prose in this book but it hardly meets the kind of praise it has received.However, a winner of the Nobel prize for literature it is, so give it a go and see for yourself."
5,Greatest Love,"I had the great opportunity to read Beloved about a year ago. Its descriptive, detailed writing was only a hint of the talent and skill that she has. The love that Sethe, the main character had for her children was the most intriguing love story that I have ever read. Toni's sensitivity towards Sethe's character made me compelled to understand her as an African-American, a woman, and a mother. Originally, I judged Sethe for her descision, but as the story line progressed, I began to see myself in this woman, this mother and understood her descision to take the lives of her children as well as her own for the sake of freedom. I believe that God has truly blessed Toni and I hope she continues to bless great lovers of literature with her writing."
1,Overrated,"Probably the most overrated book in contemporary fiction (though that title might be shared by Midnight's Children). A respectable start than descends into unintelligibility and stays there. I respect Ms. Morrison for what she is attempting to do. The fact that she has failed to do it has not deterred an overabundance of praise on her work. If you must read her, try The Bluest Eye instead. Somewhat better, and shorter."
