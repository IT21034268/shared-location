5,One of my favorites,"Hey-The first day I got this, I spent 2 hours playing and got past 2 levels. Its challenging, but not that challenging that you get so frusterated that you cant bea tthe level....Its 5/10 on how hard it is-Fun, i give it a 9/10-Let me get you better understanding on what you do-Your the manager of a citys transportation-You can sit and watch the city from overview and watch where people go and all that junk, or you can build bus routes. This means you but a bus stop at every spot you want the bus to stop. So basiclly your making the route. You buy the bus and then you set the ticket prices, how much you pay the drivers (the more you pay the better driver and the friendlyer they will be)-You see if one stop has 40 people and another has 2, you can build another bus route in that same spot to make waiting time lower. You do the same exact things with trains!!! Overall, I highly suggest this game, i am having lots of fun with it, it was completly worth the money! Randy"
2,Great Game with crash problem,"Trust the other guy's review and mine: This game crash without reasons. This is an addictive and fun game, but it is so annoying that it keeps crashing my computer. Buy it at your own risk."
5,A must for new mothers,"This is a great book, easy to understand, easy to follow, and very user-friendly! I highly recommend it. I use this method with my son, now 8mos old and we are doing well with it!"
2,Not the best book on this topic,"This book is just OK; I still felt like I didn't know how to begin infant pottying/elimination communication after reading this book. It talks about the topic without giving really clearly laid out step-by-step instructions. After I read this, I went and bought Diaper-Free Baby, which was a much better book, and was an excellent how-to guide."
3,Not the strongest reception of VHF stations,I live about 30 miles from NY city and have a hard time trying to receive most VHF (2-13) stations. In a building even worse.Maybean external ant. jack would help but this model does not have one.
2,"Good Idea, Bad Writing","This novel has a good idea and message, but there is poor execution of the point that it tries to get across. The dialogue is too unreal and lengthy; no one really talks like the people in the book. There is also a lot of repetition in the book at the end of every chapter, and in how the author keeps pointing out that Isaiah and Torri are ""carbon copies"" of Asia and Nicholas. Certain details in the novel are too detailed and other parts are not detailed enough. Basically, you should read this book to uplift yourself, not to challenge yourself in reading good literature."
1,"I agree good idea, poor writing","This is more a spiritual book than a Christian book. Yes the main characters profess a belief in God. However that does not seem to stop them from declaring their love for each other even tho of them is married to someone else, crossing the line when being tactile and rejoicing over an out of wedlock birth, and being married for all the wrong reasons.This has a soap atmosphere to it, the dialogue is extremely corny - if you want to read a book that deals with a real life topic and has real dialogue plus Christian style romance read Boaz Brown by Michelle StimpsonI borrowed this from the library its taking me months to finish."
5,best loved favorites of boxcar willie,"this cd was bought for a client, who was very pleased with it."
1,Fueling the Myth,"Here's another example of religion being based on fear and how misconceptions can create hatred. True Wicca has absolutely nothing to do with Satan. Before you you judge too heavily, remember that Christianity was once hidden and secret (the meaning of the word occult) and persecuted against. A better book would be ""The Truth About Witchcraft Today"" by Scott Cunningham."
4,Time to Grow!,"I first reviewed this album too quickly and unfairly! To my good fortune, they seem to have removed that review. Upon listening to this CD more carefully over the last year; i actually quite like it now! A tasteful album with soulful forethought, though at times a little somber, it really is a natural avenue for duncan. It is actually beautifully recorded with nice arrangements! I don't know...maybe i'm goin' a little soft and somber in my old age! The lesson learned....don't be too quick to judge!"
2,SHEIK FALLS INTO THE DEPTHS OF DEPRESSION,"Sheiks latest effort ""Phantom Moon"" goes deeper and deeper into his dark side.I have to disagree with the rest of the critics regarding ""Barely Breathing"" which was his catchiest song, and strongest effort to date next to ""She Runs Away"" and ""Serena"".His next effort got progressively worse and boring with ""Humming"", and the record buyers ran away in droves, and it shows here again in ""Phantom Moon"".I am sorry but I like the POP side of Duncan Sheik, and I still can't believe that ""Barely Breathing"" almost didn't make it to his album. Its a classy pop song that will stand the test of time.Here on ""Phantom Moon"" there are no stand out songs, hooks, just dismal, depressing, wallowing in pity songs.I say Sheik get off your Jack Kerouac stage and start writing some catchier tunes. I give it (2) stars because Duncan has an incredible voice and the production, though I didn't like the music is first rate."
4,Debbie Travis' Decorating Solutions,This book is a great resource of wonderful ideas; very imaginative and helpful.
2,Not in my house!,"I saw Debbie Travis on Oprah, and thought the redecorating she did for the show was outstanding. It was on the strength of that work that I bought this book. What a disapointment. The examples in this book, and the colors she uses are the absolute opposite of elegant and understated. Wild purples, oranges, reds, colors I don't want in my house. Some of the work looks amateurish. I was not impressed, and am going to return the book."
3,Its okay,The book doesnt have enough examples for me. I like practicing a lot. But a lot of words. The cd also didnt help
4,Pretty Good,"I actually thought this book was pretty good. I haven't used the cd. The definitions are pretty clear. I use this in conjunction with Gordis' Epidemiology for quick review. I find Rothman and Greenland is not good for that. When I am thinking about research design and elements of statistical analysis this book is easy to turn to to just go over why one test may be better than another--I am a medical student with an MPH in epi who has worked on several research projects, and I think this book is pretty helpful as a simple aid in the transition from research assistant to co-investigator."
2,Problems,"The book is fine, nothing special. Since I'm comparing it to other college textbooks the standards are pretty low. However, it is pretty important to note two things. The first is that it took 6 weeks for me to actually receive the book. Second, the cover and interior of the book are reversed and upside down. This means that unless i remove the cover myself people in class think that I'm reading the book upside-down. I would send the book back, but the semester is nearly a third complete as it is. In essence, I suggest getting the book from the school bookstore where at least you know it won't have problems."
3,Gift for Daughter.,"This was a gift for my artist daughter. I have not heard her opinion as yet. From my examination of the book, it is very informative. I was somewhat disappointed that for the price, it is not hard covered."
3,Ralph Fiennes Bio: just a Ralph Review for his true fans,"As an ardent fan of Ralph Fiennes, I immediately purchased his biography. I already knew the basics of his life--birthday, schooling, relationships, family history, etc. What I was looking for was more personal thoughts and feelings, which I guess no one seems to know or find important. That was the one aspect that the book lacked. Sure, if you want ""Ralph Fiennes 101"" just to sound like you know something about the celebrity, buy the book. $16.95 will get you that. But if you want to know something about Ralph Fiennes the person, then my suggestion would be to wait for the autobiography. Although any true fan of Ralph's would know that will be a long time coming."
4,Niiiice,"This season was packaged differently and I liked it..you could let friends borrow one disc at a time instead of risking losing the entire season to a wayward buddy's lifestyle. I breezed through this season as well. I do not know if I would say this season is my 2nd favorite including the previous 3 but it is very close, if it is not. (Nothing beats season 1...I think..have not seen season 5 yet). Our favorite characters now have offspring (who play a huge role in this season) and are growing older, if not growing up as well. Many players are part of a new game. It is a gem of a series and it did not do a thing in this season to compromise that status."
5,Great DVD set of the Wire,"Some discs in the initial package were damaged, but vendor quickly replaced them with a perfect package.Highly recommend the Wire, 4th Season."
5,It doesn't get any better,"Simply the best season of the best TV show in history. If you have had the patience to get through season four, then you already agree."
1,Not a very good quad cane,"I just received and returned this cane. The product description was wrong - the cane's handle was not made of foam. Rather, it was made of hard, textured plastic and did not serve as a very effective or comfortable grip, especially given its weight. This cane weighs a ton! It is much too heavy for someone who already has difficulty walking unassisted."
2,Not up to O'Reilly's Standards,"My usual rule is to buy anything published by O'Reilly--it's always worth it. Not this time.Garfinkel's book is extremely basic. It covers the same ground as the PGP documentation, but not as well. Worse, it's badly out of date by now.A much better bet is to read the online documentation for GnuPG, the free PGP clone, at www.gnupg.org. If you use UNIX, you should use GPG instead of PGP anyway: PGP has a wonderful interface under Windows, but has really stagnated for UNIX users."
4,economical oem replacement rotors,good oem replacement rotors. it's been a few months since I got them and I've had no problems so far.
4,Excellent material in biotelemetry,"This book provides a good overview of telemetry issues focused on living beings. It is difficult to find such detailed explanations of telemetry approaches and solutions in general biomedical engineering books.Although some of the material described in the book may be obsolote for today's technology, the priciples and approaches still remain quite valid. In any case, this book provides an excellent explanation of telemetry approaches, and those readers interested in finding more technologically modern solutions will be able to transplant the situations described in this book to today's technology. To my knowledge, there is not a similar book in the market today that substites this text."
5,Tear jerker!,"I cannot read this book without tearing up every time! It's a perfect gift for a new mom, an old mom and every mom in between! It reminds you how precious each moment is and how fast childhood goes. I love Karen Kingsbury's writing, and this sweet little book is no exception."
2,Too much filler,"I enjoy the stand up portions but the majority of this CD is filler. If you want to listen to Chris Rock in the car and have a DVD player, buy one of his stand up routines and play that instead of this."
1,"Even if you love Chris Rock, you'll HATE this album!","I am a big fan of Chris, but this album is a dirge! The only remotely redeeming parts of it are the couple of recycled bits from older albums that he included. The rest of it is a mish-mash of poorly done comedy skits and musical bits, most of which do not even involve Chris Rock as a performer. Seriously, there are several bits about crickets having a dialog about what shows they left and at what point. I guess Chris feels he has made a big enough name for himself that he doesn't have to do actual comedy anymore, and can focus on his ""vision"" and political statements. Do yourself a favor, and don't waste money on this piece of crap. Spend it on one of Chris' earlier albums instead, and you will be a lot happier."
5,This soundtrack is incredible,"This is one of the most beautiful and overall impressive soundtracks I have ever heard. The ""Dry Your Tears, Afrika"" score can be described with one word: glorious. This soundtrack not only brings your mind back to the beauty of the film itself, but also allows you to feel the joy, sadness, and inspiration that Williams hoped to portray in his music."
1,Difficult to read,The book is extremely poorly written. Very difficult to read. The ideas are not new. Don't buy it.
1,It's Just Not My Taste,I thought the cd was good for somebody who likes old stlye singing. I Believe that it may be okay for somoeone who likes that type of music. I also thought the cd was too masculine for such a group of beautiful ladies. The cd cover tricks you into thinking that your buying a group like Virtue of Trinitee 5:7 but don't be fooled. Luckily we got the cd for free!
1,"A misguided, poorly written, painfully arrogant analysis","""The Reasoning Voter"" has all of the marks of an academic wannabe who suggests the American people really aren't so stupid. Pity the students who buy this book--they're the only one who do, to be sure."
4,"Positive message, entertains the kids, whats not to love",I didn't watch this with my child but she said she liked it so there you have it. Enjoy the watch
5,Wonderful MP3 Downoad,I bought this MP3 because I have several John Stowell CD's and DVD's. If you have never heard John play it is a absolute must to purchase. This one White Men Can't Monkis with the Chuck Maronhic Trio. The trio is a very good jazz ensemble. This music is live and I have made it as part of my must listen rotation.
5,Holds up to 200 pounds!,I gave plasmacars to my one -year -old grandchildren and they can ride on them but are still using their feet to propel themselves. Their dads on the other hand are having a great time tooling around using only the handlebars to move forward. And if the handlebars are turned around the plasmacar moves backwards. A great toy for all ages(200 pounds or less).
5,best christmas gift ever!!!,My 3yr old and 7 year old love these cars- we have hardwood floors and being winter this is awesome inside they ride them everyday and so does everyone when they come over- it was the hit of xmas!!!! My 3yr old is especially great on this thing- she is only 28 lbs and whizzes round on her car!!! great exercise during the winter (she uses her legs half of the time to get speed)- great price for a great toy- everyhting else they had need batteries and so much to put together- this was s o easy and it gets them off of those electronics!!!!
4,Birthday gift for 3 year old,"A gift for my 3 year old grand daughter. She is enjoying it, your service was great and it was simple to assemble. Thank you."
1,Very dissapointed!,Purchased for my grandaughter. It does not work well or like advertised. I Wish I had never wasted my money on it.Is it possible to send back to the Manufacturer?
4,Plasmacar,My 2 year old grandson knew instinctively how to make this car work . I think this is the main reason it gets such high marks Even I could ride on it with ease
3,"A nice box, but a little pricey!","I purchased this as a gift for someone. The box is a nice sized box, however, the box itself does not look like the one in the advertised photo. The paint, which is supposedly hand painted, is not as deep in color and detail as in the photo and the roses are not as defined as in the photo. I expected this gourmet ""food"" gift basket to be that! There is no food, and since it is a gift basket, I expected the items to be displayed coming out of the box as in the photo to make it attractive looking. The items inside are packed inside with the box lid closed. I found this gift was nice, but was a little disappointed in it. I also thought it was a bit pricey at $60."
1,Old box with oxidized and broken lock.,I paid for a beautiful gift like the picture but i got an article that looked used! The white paint was yellowish. It's a old box with oxidized and broken lock. I throw away the cookies because don't have expiration date.
3,Serrated Grapefruit Spoons,"The narrow spoon area doesn't hold a lot of juice and the packaging was so poor, the spoons arrived banging around in the box, loose from the wire that should of been holding them to card."
1,Returned Item.,The shoes were sent back because the tongue was not attached to the sides. A feature that keeps dirt from getting in the shoes.
1,"Great toe room, zero traction in wet/ oily areas","I purchased these boots because of the oblique toe which provides more room in the toe section of the boot. To me these boots are very comfortable in the toe section but the first day wearing the boots at work, I slipped and fell because these boots have no traction at all in any kind of wet or oily enviroment. The soles have only shallow treads on the bottom that seem to do nothing to provide grip.These boots also seem to be made very wide in the area just below the lacing. I ordered a medium width but there seemed to be a lot of buckling right at the bottom of the laces when walking.Sending these boots back and the search continues for a comfortable boot with plenty of toe room and good grip in oily conditions."
3,Boo!,"I ordered this book after a trip to St Augustine, FL so it was especially interesting to me. It tells you about the same type of hauntings that the expensive ghost tours there do plus you have the hardcopy to refer back to. A good little book, should've been a little longer & more in-depth."
4,Richie's side,"Nice story about Richie's life. I saw the Springfield and Poco both in their earliest forms and always admired both. What put me off was all the God/Jesus references as it was bit much. I felt he could have summed that up in a final chapter about what's lead him to where he is now. Great read if you can get past all that ""born again"" stuff."
5,An Inspiring Story,"A truly inspiring story. Open and honest, it shows that one can be at the top of the world in the eyes of observers, but on the inside there is still a void that needed to be filled. Richie Furay told a story of pursuit, fame, disappointment, despair, and triumph. If you think you ""want it all"", this book's for you. If you think you ""have it all"" this book's for you. If you think that you have ""nothing"", this book is for you."
2,Frank in Redding,"The low is rating is based on the problems with delivery as we have not used the canner yet. FedEx brought the first one...Broken!! It looked like it was dropped from a FedEx jet!! Ups devilered the second one, it was also damaged, but it looks servicable. Although Amazon's price was good, unless the packageing is improved I suggesting getting at a local store where you can check-it-out before you get it home."
3,"Not the company, but the people","This book doesn't tell the story of the company SONY, but the career of the people who created and ran it: the Morita's, Ibuka, Ohga, Idei and some US officers - Schulhof, Yetnikoff.The portraits are very favourable, nearly and sometimes really hagiographies (e.g. 'Yoshiko's genius as a hostess' p. 80)For a more critical portrait of Akio Morita, see Ian Buruma's 'The Missionary and the Libertine'.Sony is evidently a big success story, but it is also a tale of egos, ambitions, stress, clashes, strokes, heart attacks and fear of death (Akio Morita: I'll never die).John Nathan gives us a good picture of the defeated Japan after WWII.The Columbia saga is well told, but is better unravelled in Nancy Griffin's 'Hit and Run'.The real story behind the loss of the crucial video battle is not revealed.A good character study of the people who created a world company from scratch."
5,Knowledgeable and insightful,"Excellent book, very astute knowledge of and concise explanation of Japanese culture and nuances. Brave in many of its assertions, particularly of the Sony executives' attraction to Jewish executives.Smooth read, flows nicely. Great book, highly recommended. Personal tiny quip: as a videogames fanatic, would have liked to see more about the Playstation, especially considering public assertions about the fact that the unit is the most highly profitable within the contest."
2,Finish is inconsistent,Shelves were easy to install but the three shelves did not match each other. Two of the shelves were indeed a dark walnut finish but the longer shelf has a lighter cherry finish.
1,Can't review this product when I STILL haven't received them!!,"Ordered these slippers on 12/04/10 . received the wrong size, called and was assured my order would be here by Xmas. haven't heard from anyone...no RA in the mail, no slippers, no return phone calls!"
5,Excellent,This book goes into much greater depth (no pun) than any other book on sailing I've read. It's packed with information on a wide variety of topics.
4,Greast reference for a budding sailor,My 7 year old first got the 3rd edition from the library and then we purchased the 2nd edition used. Both are great resources with huge amounts of knowledge. Difficult for a 7 year old to read but it'll be there as he grows. The second edition is just fine for our needs. The pictures are dated and perhaps the more advanced things are updated but basic sailing remains the same.
2,Not your Grandma's,"This bacon press is smaller and not as heavy as the Taylor&NG; brand that it is attempting to copy.The item is a made in China knock-off and the artwork is crude in comparison to the original. However, it is cast iron, so I cannot imagine that it will not do the job. It will be given as a gift, so the egg rings add a little value to an otherwise disappointing item."
5,Delicious.,"Being a vegetarian, I have been through my fair share of various vegetarian broths that were less than stellar. This particular flavor and brand was a pleasant surprise to experience because it was rich and flavorful without tasting like an artificial knockoff that most vegetarian broths end up tasting like. And the best part is that it isn't just awesome as a broth, it is awesome for seasoning anything from stir-fried veggies to gravy."
2,Worse than other Drake's books,"Imagine a rifle clip loaded with rounds of different caliber and type. That's the impression this book left on me. Just a bunch of loosely related stories of varying quality, all about a subject that I personally found less than interesting. ""The Jungle"" is approximately 1000 times better."
5,perfect amp,"Picked this amp up new upon the recommendation of a seasoned acoustic player. This amp has such clear tone, especially when strumming(where other amps have a ""smearing/muddied sound""). And the digital effects retain the acoustic tone first, and the addition of the effects are very clear and full. Don't let the small size fool you, this amp is quite loud and has that tight closed enclosure response (reminded me alot of my Ampeg 8x10 classic for the clarity and power). In this price class, it isn't possible to beat this combo."
3,Was the book revised extensively in 1997?,"I read the first edition of this book, published in 1989, and have different comments from many of the reviewers here. The chapters on the origins and impact of WWII (Chapters 1, 15-18), and on the topics of Anglo-American strategies, strategic bombing and morale (Chapters 8, 10 and 11) are informative. The 6 chapters on the European and North African fronts are generally strong, although a bit pro-British. Yet the 3 chapters about the Pacific war are very weak. There are other one-volume history of the Second World War which provides a more balanced and global perspective than this one."
5,Incredible,"This is an incredible CD, from the sparkling orchestrations which are chamber but in the way they are mixed everything dances out at you, to the vocal interpretations which are so innovative for a recording of this type...settings of poetry but sung by regular, albeit, extraordinary regular people (except people like Dawn Upshaw and Audra McDonald who have already established themselves as major vocal artists)so that the songs feel personal. There is about this CD an incredibly meaningful air...moving, magisterial, powerful...straight from ""Heaven"" to ""Joy"" Gordon takes us on an inexorable journey through life towards transcendence and he and his brilliant players and performers succeed...Nonesuch does it again...Superb! Kudos all around. Gordon is a REAL composer, with a deep understanding of poetry as well as a fabulous gift for writing words himself!"
5,Wonderful album of songs and singers,"I bought this CD due to a search for Audra MacDonald's work - she appears on several tracks along with Dawn Upshaw and and handful of other fine singers, male and female. The moods are varied, with the style being a mix of theatre music and modern ""art song"" and most appear to be written for high voice. Most of the songs are settings of well-known poets such as Edna St. Vincent Millay and Langston Hughes, but the title track and another one written entirely by Mr. Gordon (Run Away) grabbed me right away. I was immediately inspired to look up and purchase several of the available sheet music offerings and am thrilled to be working on his songs for performance"
2,A really outdated collection of worship songs,"This 2 CD set is filled with many old songs that the younger generation can't really relate to. Maranatha Music has always produced cheesy sounding worship songs which claim to be ""comtemporary"", but utterly fails to be that.For a better compilation of worship songs that have songs that people would not be embarrased playing in front of their non-christian friends, I recommend the I Could Sing of Your Love Forever compilations produced by Worship Together."
2,"Not what expected, side curled after a few days?","Not what expected, side curled after a few days? Was a good fit until it curled, an we don't get real bed weather in CA and I MAY drive only 5 miles a day, so not from excessive use. Passenger side is fine, maybe Drivers side was lemon. Would like a phone # of someone in company. Bad piece? other than that I like them."
2,Mine Broke,"It was a gift, and Im sad to say that it broke within a month or two. It was good while it lasted. Some of the problems it had before it broke was that it would make this odd noise that sounded like the machinery inside was grinding. THis would produce a sickening smell, like exploded batteries. Smelled like something nuclear <(i know that sounds odd...but its true) This went on for a few weeks until it just wouldn't work any more. Its funny because i only used it in my car like once a week but it still broke down."
5,Wheel of a deal!!,"This is the Dremel accressory that I've been looking for. A great little metal cut-off wheel. Sturdy, cuts through small nuts and bolts, and does not seem to break. It fits in tight places, and is perfect for the handyman with demo. problems. It is not going to cut through rebar, but most Dremel users already know that. Forget those little waffer disc's. The quick change mandrel is a bonus!!"
4,Nice feeders!,"These are nice feeders. I don't have to fill each up as often and they are less cluttery than the 2 food bowls and one big water bowl I used to use. Downside--I didn't get to pick the color. So I have 2 light blue feeders in my green and red kitchen. Also, the lid on the catfood feeder fits but I have to hit it with my fist a few times to get it into place. Would I recommend? Yes, but please let me pick the color!!"
2,Just so/so,"The water dispenser leaked from the top seam. I figured it wasn't a big deal, as it would only be an issue while filling the container. However, about 15 minutes after filling the tub and putting the dispenser together, I walked by and realized that all of the water in the container was now on the carpet. The lid did not seal properly and the tab in it that lets small amounts of water out was also leaking! What a mess! I returned the item and would not recommend it. The food feeder seemed fine."
3,Good product,"Water bowl works great. Food bowl doesn't poor by itself, you gotta give it a little shake to fill the bowl."
3,Waterer is Excellent But the Food Feeder is Questionable,"I purchased these for two cats and the waterer works very well but the food feeder does not automatically fill the bowl when empty. It works well if you are at home and can prod the food into the feeder bowl. However, I would not recommend that you leave your animals alone with the food feeder because it does not work as it should."
2,It's not easy being fourteen and it's not easy reading this,"Okay, I love Beverly Cleary's books. There's not one book I hate, except for one. Yep. It's Strider. I loved Dear Mr. Henshaw, but Strider's one of those books that doesn't appeal to me. Beverly Cleary writes this at 75 years of age in the voice of a 14 year old, and yet she doesn't sound like one. (Trust me, I'm fourteen myself!) It's a slow book and the only thing that was worth it was the fact it was by Beverly Cleary. And that's it."
3,S Review,"Strider is about Leigh and a dog named Strider, as well as Leigh's friend, Barry. Leigh is depressed about his parents divorcing, and uses Strider to fill the gaps of his life voided by his problems. This book is about friendship and struggles of the hardships of everyday life.This book was definitely not my favorite book. Though well written, I didn't appeal to the plot (or any of the other ""boy and his dog"" novels I've read). It wasn't the fast-paced, action-packed novel that I usually read. I did, however, relate to Leigh's feelings and can appreciate the author's ability to write with detail.Though a mediocre book in my opinion, I would recommend Strider to novel fans. Most other people can seem to appreciate these such stories more than I."
2,"""Christian"" Dream Rider?","Perhaps the producer(s) of this film had the intentionof preaching christianity with this film. The film started with a kissand then ended with a kiss in a church premises betweentwo un-married adults,could this be the way of Jesus, theson of Mary, the Messenger of God?To the film proper, it's about having two fatal accidents,becoming seriously handicapped and still aiming for a dream,about how to prepare to achieve it...."
5,Love it!,i wanted to make my own taco salads at home and these bow makers are great the tortilla does not stick to the pan and it makes a tasty taco salad.
5,Strong Bowl,"I was pleasantly surprised when I opened up my package and saw the sturdy heavy duty quality that these bowls were made from. I am so glad that I purchased 2 sets. I debated on whether to spend $15.99 on two bowls, but did so because of not wanting to have to fry tortilla's. This is a great alternative and much healthier choice."
4,Good tool to have!,"Awesome. A must have for every home owner. Compact, quiet compare to others, but powerful. It has been a life saver for many of my upholstery and home improvement projects. I love it and I'm a woman."
5,OWNER,This is the best compressor made. My men fight over the two that I own. We are a glazing contractor and do a lot of wood window repair and use 18 ga. air nailers.
4,good balance,"This compressor is a good balance of weight vs capacity. It doesn't hold much air, but it is light and portable and quiet. In boosting my tire pressures by 10 PSI, I pretty much had to let it re-fill in between each tire (large tires.) Even still, I like my compressor."
3,Good little compressor for few short years,"I used this compressor for about 3-4 years consistently to do trim and cabinets on a number of remodels and custom homes. Must have done at least about 6,000 feet of molding easily. Worked great during that time, but then started to take longer to fill up and eventually the pressure switch went out causing it to run without stopping. I finally took it in for repair, but the price to repair it was the same to buy a new one. The pump cylinder seal went bad as well as the pressure switch. I had also replace one of the gauges too previously. For home use it is fine, but not professional use. Only works with 23 gauge or 18 gauge nailers. I wouldn't purchase this model again. I might purchase the bigger PC0968, but the parts are probably very similar and long lasting or built for professional use."
1,"A Great ""Must Read""",If you have ever wanted a comprehensive Christian Dating manual then this is it.I only wish I had read and (re-read it annually) from the age of 10.A must for all Christians whether single or married.
3,Sarah's Thought's,"This book was about a girl who wants to become a teacher in the 1920's, but when her teacher has to leave her chances are zeroed out.The book had many conflicts and was suspensful. This book taught me to keep trying and you might achieve your goals. I am in the sventh grade and I liked it but I think kids younger than me would like it more than I did. I thought this book was ok."
4,too short to drive the model T,In a back wood Colorado one room school house a young girl provesthat she has what it takes to get to high schoolby keeping the school open in secretwhen the teacher is called away to nurse her sick mother.There is also a first teen love romance mixed up in the fight to keep the schoolopen and learning going on.As a children's reader this story is interesting and quick paced.I liked the short novel that resultsbetter than some of Avi's other work that I've reviewed.
4,A teacher in 8th grade?,"Ida desperately wants to become a teacher...she just needs to finish 8th grade first. But something happens and their teacher has to leave. And the school board refuses to find another one! So Ida steps up as teacher. Things go pretty smoothly, until Ida begins falling behind. Her own studies pile up, plus there are chores to do and sleep to catch up on. Ida wats to pass the exam more than anything, but she needs to put her pupils first. Another great one by Avi, ""The Secret School"" is intriguing and gives readers a look at life several years ago."
4,Uniden 5.8,Uniden TRU9380 is agreat system I had a matching 4 phone set same and needed to expand. Individual add ons were more money. I was able to deprogram each of the 4 new sets and re program them to the one set I already had and now have 8 phones off one base and use the one base strictly as a charger. Everything arrived as promissed and everything works fine. First time using amazon.com and very pleased
2,Slightly less than OK,Works just OK for lateral cuts on corrugated 26 ga. sheet metal. Rather hard to control. Cross cutting is a bitch! Scrapes much of the paint off also.
2,An entertaining work of ficton,"Don Juan has certainly gotten around and has many newly discovered apprentices inculding Mr. Ego feather...He has jumped into one ""new-age"" fad as an expert then another..go figure..."
3,A GREAT PERFORMANCE IN AN AVERAGE FILM,"This Canadian film stars Len Cariou as a crusading TV reporter who runs afoul of big business interests in Montreal. Cariou,a native of Canada, is known primarily for his New York theatre work,but has also made many film and TV appearances. Here, he gives a nuanced performance in a fairly mundane story. He's clearly the standout actor in the piece:although the supporting cast is OK, it's Cariou who conveys the story's cental moral dilemma as a man who could lose everything by doing the right thing."
5,omg leslie,well i personally love leslie carter since she came out and i always will the 1st time i heard her song like wow i loved her i went out 2 the store and bought it there was only 2 left and i listen 2 it every day since i got the cd i highly recomend this cd*\o/*
3,Definately NOT LIKE WOW!,I don't mean to be mean but I so can't believe this bright girl released that song as her first single its very um bland for lack of words However True shows she has some potential if anyone decides to use it. Like Wow is way over processed and you don't get a feeling of her and its not even that caughty. I hope They realize that before they release her ablum and with luck her second single will be off the hook
1,Please,"It's sad what passes for music these days. At least try to listen to something where you can hear actual live instruments, not just synthesizers and indistinguishable washed-out ""vocals."""
1,like [not very good],"I love Aaron and Nick Carter but Leslie is the most untalented singer ever! The only reason she got a record deal is because of her brothers. Not only can she not sing on the CD but in concert she is terrible. My friend and I when to an Aaron Carter concert last summer and she was one of the openning acts. We were cracking up when she started singing because she couldn't sing at all. I am sure Leslie is talented, just not at singing, she should leave the singing to her brothers."
3,Like...Wow?!,"Okay first, who comes out with a song called Like Wow. Sorry that just gets to me. Like Wow. It is actually a catchy song, but it is REALLY cheezy, I recommend it for pre teens who loved Aaron before his voice changed. I think that she can actually sing but it doesn't show it in the lower range (She sounds like Aaron) If you don't listin to the words or anything and just sing the 'It's like woooow!' then you'll be okay."
2,Not That Great,I didnt find this all too useful. I couldnt get the ravioli sheets to stick together well as they all came apart. Maybe I'll try again and re-review if it works better next time.
1,"for older kids, not younger ones","My daughter, 8, bought this movie as a part of a DVD collection called ""Benji's Favorite Dog Tales."" It had a grandfather dying, a pet dog who catches rabies, an infected cut treated with maggots, a teenage boy arrested, etc... Definitely not for 8 year olds. And, definitely not ""Benji's favorite"" either. My daughter says that this was a horrible movie. To the manufacturer's credit, we have since noticed the PG rating on the back. But, who would look for a rating on a ""Benji"" movie?"
1,FOR DOG HATERS... and people who like to see dogs suffer.,"A horrible addition to the ""DVD Benji Dog Tales Collection"".. dont watch this expecting it to be a boy/girl and her dog story.. its not... here's my review on the collection..I can't believe anyone would be so cruel as to put one of these features in a collection about dogs. ""A collection of Dog tales indeed"". In the Castle Rock DVD, they kill the dog with a gun shot after it chases the heroine down and bites her companion.. Do dog lovers want to see the dog turn on the humans and then get shot? This DVD is simply a marketing ploy created by immoral people who only care about milking the public for a few more thousands to line their bank account. A law suit against GATAM media for false advertising would be welcome by me. The DVD menu is completely unclear as well. What do you expect from people who are soulless! Dogs and humans alike will hate this one."
1,The Trip,"Boy, did I want to like this movie. A road trip spanning the 70's and the 80's - the politics, the drama, the memories.Instead I got a poorly acted, badly directed and dismally written film. What a missed opportunity!The brunt of the blame, in my opinion, goes to the writer/director, who couldn't decide if he was writing/directing a drama, a comedy, a dramady or a gay Thelma and Louise. So what we get is disjointed film filled with a hodge-podge of stale ideas, actors who seem lost most of the time (Arquette, a fine gay indie actor, is totally wasted in this film!) and badly contructed scenes that never manage to be sad or funny or anything at all, for that matter.Sad, sad, sad."
2,DISAPPOINTMENT,"For a movie that deals with acceptance, equal rights, tolerance etc, it sure managed to include every Mexican stereotype. The acting was good, but the directing and story line was very mediocre. I wanted to like this movie!"
1,Disappointed,"Thankfully, I rented this before purchasing. Smart move on my part! What a disapponting film. The writer/director clearly had the money to make a good movie, it just wan't spent on the script. No idea why this movie is getting good reviews. I don't drop my expectations simply because a movie is low budget or has a gay theme. This movie disappoints in every aspect."
4,Pleasantly Surprising...,"Given the lack of quality in most gay-themed films, I was pleasantly surprised by this film. It had dialogue that didn't make you wince, actors who could actually act (and very well at that), and direction that almost bordered on professional. Most importantly though, the film was actually romantic in it's own sort of way. However, this isn't a romantic comedy; rather, it's a travelogue of sorts concerning two young men and how the politics of the early 70's through mid 80's affected their relationship. It has plenty of serious moments along with a surprising amount of humorous moments, and it's the uneven balance of these two that is really the only flaw in the film (well, that and a rushed ending). I highly recommend this over the dreck that has come out lately that favors shock over heart (i.e. Eating Out). Don't pass this one up..."
2,Eh,"Predictable and trite gay B movie. One of the parade of gay indie films trying too hard without focusing on the details of good writing, direction and acting. It's interesting enough to pass the time if you're bored, but not good enough to care about any of the characters."
2,nice and easy,"This movie was good, but not very entertaining, (just my opinion)i liked it but after watching it didnt really feel like i wanted to watch it again, but its a good movie to lend to friends."
4,A Nice Trip,a sweet coming out movie at the time when gay liberation at its infancy. these two handsome main characters shall also bring delight to your eyes.
2,the trip,for me the story was a little too flip and choppy. I think I would have rented it instead. On the next yard sale this video will probably wind up on the sale table....
5,This is the real deal. Everything else is a toy.,"This is the best scoop ever! Do not confuse this with the flimsy scoops you purchase from the grocery or department store-- you can just throw them away! Its real heavy and the teeth cut though the ice cream like butter. Plus the release button on top allows you to perfectly place scoops onto your cone-- no other ice cream scoop has that.Btw the secret to making perfectly round ice cream scoops is rinsing the scooper after every scoop. That way the ice cream never gets stuck/freezes in the scoop. Don't fall for the scoops that claim to be ""non-stick"" or the microwavable ones-- not worth the money."
1,Worst scooper I've ever used,"After reading several great reviews, I thought this would be the perfect replacement for a lost (cheaper) ice cream scooper. Unfortunately, I found it sorely lacking in several areas. First, the scoop head itsself is rather thin. Thus, it turns cold immediately and the ice cream sticks to it - even after rinsing in hot water. Second, the shape of the head is a half-sphere, which doesn't form balls as well as the more saddle-shaped heads. Third, the push-out lever is a pain to use and clean - with better-shaped heads, getting the ball out is not an issue - with this one, it often doesn't work and gets gunked up pretty quickly. Finally, as another review pointed out the finish looks awful after one wash in the dishwasher."
1,A Fine Ride to Miss,"I bought this one in the bargain bin for $1.00, which should have tipped me off. There is nothing stimulating about this CD-every song basically sounds the same and the mix is quite muddy. I sold it back to the same store for the same price, so no harm done. This band rides indeed, but what they ride isn't anything I'd want inside of me."
1,Beware,"When you see a group of 5-star reviews, in which all of the reviewers have only one review, and none of them have the ""Real Name"" badge, then you know that these reviews were all posted by the same person - someone who wants to hype the product.Also, when you see that all of the reviews have the same quirk (no capitalization for example), then you can be *CERTAIN* that they were written by the same person."
4,Excellent,"This is one of my favorite dvd's. The cuing is very good, it goes at a very fast pace and the instructor kind of assume that you know the moves. I don't think it is for beginners, probably for intermediate like myself and advance practitioners. If you are looking for something slower try MTV Yoga, it goes at a slower pace but still is a great workout."
5,Buy it now!,"I LOVE this DVD; have been doing power yoga for 3 years & love my gym's classes there, but wanted something just as challenging for when I can't get to the gym - this is it. Bought it before Christmas & did it 6 times over the Christmas-NYE season & it helped me to maintain muscle (especially in arms & thighs), burn fat, reduce stress & stay flexible through the holiday chaos! You will sweat, it's very hard at first, but gets easier; and there are other people on the DVD that you can watch for easier moderations of the poses. Very challenging & fun & the 5 minutes of pilates at the end are quick & effective."
2,Damaged Goods,"I ordered a new jersey form this seller and it came damaged. The jersey looked fine until I put it on. There was a big sticky brown streak on the upper right shoulder of the jersey and I could not get it off. My recommendation, when it comes to ordering jerseys, is to go to the store amd look it over really good before you buy it. Even though it is supposed to be new, you could still find a defect in the jersey. I would not order from this seller again."
5,i love this show,Very excited to hear season 2 is coming out. I loved watching season 1 dvd's but it was so bitter sweet because I didn't think anymore dvd's would be made. Please release the 3rd season ASAP- it was my fav. of the three.I protested ABC when the show was cancelled and I'm really grateful for these dvd releases. can't wait til August!UPDATE: Just got my Second Season Today- Can't wait to watch it. (august 26th)
4,Once and Again -- Good to see you again!,It was nice to finally find the second season of this show. It went off the air way too soon! Nice to find a new copy of the dvd's!
3,Reads like a Masters Thesis,"In this world of increased Globalism, where millions of people cross ethnic and linguistic frontiers on a daily basis, one would think that bilingualism would be a well studied subject. I was dissapointed by Bilingual Family in that it unsucessfully tries to be both scholarly and a ""how to"" manual. For a serious student or scholar of bilingualism this book is a dissapointment in that it is a superficial and somewhate dated survey of the current literature on bilingualism. Those looking for a ""how to"" manual will also be dissapointed by the stilted and dry writing style of the authors. The best thing about the book is the numerous short case studies of family bilingualism in numerous parts of the world. In the end, I felt as though I was reading somebody's Masters Thesis."
2,Nice attempt but fell a bit flat,"This book has its moments and you can tell the author knows his subject but the level or writing was bit lacking. It too jumbled and too difficult to try and figure out just what is being said. I prefere a book written in plain, straight-spoken English. Still, if you already know some VB and can put in the time to overcome some of the communication issues, you can benefit from this book. However, if you are a newbie and don't have the time, I'd look elsewhere."
4,What I needed,Use this for my own mix of seasoned salt and it is plenty big enough. I like the various size holes on the top......however there is always a mess there with salt all over it. Not a big deal but sometimes mildly irritating.
4,SUPER VALUE,"This is a sturdy set, quality Stainless, well made. I've seen identical sets sell for outrageous high prices, just because of a designer name. A fancy name, does a lousy job of mixing anything. These are strong enough to mix whatever you need, without worrying about flimsy tools wasting your time and ingredients.Well made for the job, and ready to perform as expected. You will not be disappointed, these are very good tools. Saving a bundle of cash, makes the icing you can whip up, even sweeter!"
2,I don't like these,"Whisks are something I have a lot of since I use them all the time. These are my least favorite and I almost never use them. The handle is too fat for my liking. This is likely a personal thing as I have really small hands and the thickness of the handle might not bother someone with a regular size hand but for the other women out there with petit hands - I don't think you'll like these very much. They are just not comfortable to hold. The whisk itself is also very stiff - there is virtually no give in there. Using one of these whisks is no different from using a fork and I would probably choose a fork over one of these whisks since I would at least be able to get a good, quick motion going with a fork. Meh..... I think these whisks and the shape and size of my hand don't get on well."
3,A little small and light,These whisks were a little smaller then I expected and were somewhat light. They could use slightly more heft. The light weight also makes them fell kind of cheap. Good for the odd jobs and they stayed in my drawer for use as needed.
5,A Great Set,"For the price, this is a great set of three. I like how they feel in my hand. They seem to be the right size around to give my hand something to grip onto and yet they are not too fat that my hand gets sore holding/using these for any length of time. These are as easy to clean as any other whisk. They have held up well to my use and to being in a drawer and dropped countless times.Well worth the money.Enjoy."
3,Whiskettes,"These are very nice whisks, all things considered, and the other reviews for the most part tell you why. I thought I was getting a set to cover most of my needs; however, I found all of them about an inch or two too small. The largest isn't really balloon-y enough to do an efficient job at a big batch of egg whites, for example, tiring your arm out faster than a larger one would. The middle size is pretty good for omelets and bechamels, but the small one is a lilliputian thing, only fit for a pygmy. Its handle is really too short to be useful even for vinaigrettes. If they had only inflated their sizes a bit, this set would have been fit for every need, and near perfect."
1,"Beware, they leak SAND from the inside!","I just opened these, and as I was peeling off the made in China stickers, I noticed that one of the end-caps wasn't fully set on the largest whisk. When I went to push it in, I noticed that I couldn't, because it was blocked by something. I pulled it out to look inside, and much to my dismay, SAND started pouring out of it onto my counter-top! Apparently they fill them with sand for the weight, because they are completely hollow otherwise (I expected thick, heavy duty metal, by the looks of them from the outside).I will try to post a picture of this to the item.Buyer Beware."
5,the price was very good,"I like the handles on the whisks,It makes them easier to use. I have told and showed my family and friends the set."
5,Best pressure canner,I previously had a pressure canner with a gasket that would always leak. The All-American canner has no gasket and therefore no problems with leaking. I also love the fact that I can process 14 quarts at a time. It is a real time saver.
5,All American 30 Qt. Pressure Canner,"All-American 30-Quart Pressure Cooker/CannerThis product is very well made and works wonderfully for canning meat! It holds 14 quart jars, so you don't waste excessive energy canning. Not only stove top energy, but physical energy. It cuts down on the amount of time required to stock your winter shelves! The only drawback that I can find is my stove just had enough energy to create the temperature required for canning meat. Canning meat requires the higher temps for safety, but it got the job done! One thing I would do differently now, is to use distilled water. Hard water leaves a white residue which is hard to remove from the jars when done."
5,Dog mania Puzzle,I bought this puzzle as a Christmas present.The recipient told me the quality was very high standard.He is an ardent puzzler & has worked with many.There was an added challenge in that the border is all black & more difficult to do.
5,Touching...,"I got my first copy of Owl in Love in '95 when I was 14. As a new kid in a new town that year I thuroughly identified with the alienation the main character went through. When my mother found me reading it, however, and discovered it was ""about a girl who eats mice"", she threw it away and pretended it had gotten lost in the unpacking. Years later when I was in college I was working at a Barnes & Noble and ordered myself a new copy so I could enjoy the story again. I'm so glad I did, it remains one of my favorites."
5,Family Guy,The DVD's were delivered to me as promised by vendor. The only issue I have is that the plastic clips that hold the DVD in the container are real chinsy and several of them broke. I had no problems with the quality of the DVD's.
3,Not loud enough,"I bought this thing to use it in recess or outside school, but students say they can not hear it. If turned to the loudest setting then it makes noises. Good for inside places and small crowds."
1,Good for indoor use only,"I tried two of these, and both failed to show outdoor temps after just a few weeks. If you want reliable outdoor data, get the wired type of thermometer."
4,Good stuff,I reaceived my toshiba stand ST6265 very fast. It was little damagd on bottom cormer. good low prise and good iteam.Thanks.
1,aggitated,I expected 2 yards by 2 yards . . . not 2 yards by 1 yard . . . I am very upset that it is useless for what I intended and not worth the expense of sending them back! Definitely not worth more than 2.50 let alone more!
1,not good,It dosent hold together. I think because its unbleached but I dont know.it wasnt terrible. So I wont buy it again
1,This is NOT cheesecloth.,"This stuff is feathery garbage, not real cheesecloth. I don't know how they can get away selling it. Real cheesecloth is almost fabric-like: in fact people used to wear real cheesecloth as clothes. Cheesecloth should look and feel like cloth: is should resemble muslin (which is a good substitute). I gave this one star because I could not give it no stars. Don't think you are going o get good results with this stuff: it cannot stand up to straining large amounts of soup and it is far too flimsy to use in real cheesemaking."
1,Agree with other reviewers - too open - useless,"This cheese cloth is VERY open, about 1/8 inch openings. Very thin too, useless for anything I can think off. Absolutely useless for cooking."
3,"Help, I've fallen, etc.","No problems setting it up. It's range leaves something to be desired. If the signal has to go through 2 or 3 walls, operation gets iffy. Thickly padded furniture affect it too. it also got ""confused"" when actually used and wouldn't hang up. Had to be shut off (Rebooted)and reprogrammed. Bottom line is it works, but..........."
4,Shooting Straight to the Top,"I am delighted to find that Rick Blechta has now succesfully consolidated his own unique writing style with this latest crime thriller. He creates a well rounded and intriguing plot that succesfully blends suspense, tension and humour. With 'Shooting Straight' Blechta has forcefully elbowed his way into a crowded room of crime writers and has made himself heard above the din! Well done."
2,Half of the system works the other does not,"I used the Taylor Digital Thermometer for two years before the outside sensor quit working. When I received the replacement sensor I had some difficulty getting it to kick in, and when it finally did only the temperature function worked. The humidity reads 99% constantly. I should probably send it back but it is too much hassle and I wanted it mainly for the temperature reading anyway."
2,I agree with those who say the quality is lacking,"I received my bamboo steamer today, and everything the more critical reviews state is true. The pieces do not fit together well, and the bamboo is rather flimsy and rough. Also, my particular set has dark spots all over one of the trays already. I could imagine how bad this would get after using it as a steamer. The only reason I'm not returning this item is because I've decided to use the unspotted tray to store garlic, shallots, and other small onions. Otherwise, this would have been the first item I'd ever had to send back to Amazon."
4,I like this thing,"I bought this because I wanted to start steaming fresh veggies for my dinners instead of boiling bags of frozen vegetables every time. It works great, although I can't see any advantage over a metal one."
4,Amazon Did Right,"Perhaps it was my fault since the website does NOT specify size. I assumed, wrongly, that I was ordering 6-inch steamers. Instead, I got 10-inch baskets which I did not want. Looking at the website again, it does not give the dimensions. In any event, I am stuck with them since it does not pay to return this low-priced item.Moreover, I was disappointed to see that bright metal (copper?) staples, not shown on illustration, are used to hold the bamboo. I've been using bamboo steamers for 60 years from my early days in the Far East and never, never had seen metal used as a binding and wouldn't have wanted any.Nota Bene: Amazon later did the right thing upon my complaint and refunded the total cost. Cheers to Amazon."
4,"This ""Fire"" is cool!","It would be all too easy to dismiss this Boston-based quintet as a ""derivative"" offshoot of the Rolling Stones (circa the ""Let it Bleed"" era) or as a kind of rootsy Television clone. Lead singer David Wildman does a great imitation of Mick Jagger on some songs and Tom Verlaine on others. (Toss in a bit of Bob Dylan to boot.) But these guys aren't merely clones. ""Fire"" has something to say and it says it in a style that borrows from the greats (Don't all bands do that?) and rearranges those elements in a way that is truly different.If you're a fan of what Gram Parsons called ""Cosmic American Music"" with a sharp edge (and an occasionally literary reference added to the mix to show your friends you didn't sleep through your college classes) you owe it to your ears - and your head - to buy this disc.And speaking as a Connecticut Yankee, if you're from New England you're letting your people down if you don't act now!!!!!"
5,Southern Comfort,"My Brother Michael is as delicious as a large glass of sweet tea on a hot Florida day! Janis Owens is a wonderful writer, with a skillfully spirited understanding of small- town Southern idiosyncrasies. This poignantly told story of love lost and found, captivates the reader immediatly with its wry Southern comfort and charm."
3,The Pet Shop Needs More Animal,"""Release"" certainly provides some noteworthy songs and lyrics on such tracks as ""Home and Dry,"" ""London,"" and ""E-mail."" However, this album is quite tired. It's certainly conceivable that the Pet Shop Boys can put out a less danceable album that is of comparable artistic quality to ""Very,"" ""Bilingual,"" and ""Behavior."" But, ""Release"" has too much filler material of sleepy, watered-down, uninspired craft. It's one thing to be calm and beautiful like a swan; it's another to be a manatee under the water that no one notices."
2,zzzzzzzzzzz,"I am a huge fan of the PSB but not of this album (unfortunately). I've noticed in some of the reviews, people are using the words ""relaxed"", ""moody"" and ""somber"", well... yeah, those do apply to the WHOLE album. It's not a horrible album but it is one of their weakest efforts. Prepare to put it on a drift off ...zzzzzzzzzz"
1,Disappointingly Weak,"I love the Pet Shop Boys...I mean how could you not. Release, PSB eighth full length studio album, is disappointing and weak. Instead of making trends, they are following them. Instead of their brand of tongue-in-cheek pop/dance music they lean more toward glam rock. Most of it is boring and outdated. PSB have been slipping on quality releases since the half baked NIGHTLIFE release. But unlike that release, there isn't any songs on here that are worth walking across a street for. US edition features a bonus disc of remixes and b-sides."
1,Worst PSB Album,"Before ""Release"", there had been no PSB album that I didn't like. I'm not sure what the boys were trying to do here, but it fails on all levels. There is not one song on here that screams ""stand-out"". In fact, ""Alternative"" (their collection of B-Sides) is much more listenable than anything on ""Release"". The only song I do like on the album is ""You Choose"". After the great 1999 release, ""Nightlife"", and I can't believe the boys went in this direction. I understand they needed to experiment with less production and more guitars (with Johnny Marr), but the song writing is not on par with their past efforts either."
3,Nice little album,"This is definitely not the best Pet Shop Boys album ever, but it's one production that has several songs that are highly enjoyable and in perfect sync with the times... some of them (""E-Mail"") just TOO much in sync (if you know what I mean)! The opening track ""Home and Dry"" actually qualifies in my book as a great song and one of my favorites by PSB. The techno-ish ""The Samurai In Autumn"" and the downtempo ""Love Is A Catastrophe"" (yes, it's a bit depressing) are also great tracks. The rest of the tracks are OK, not awesome, but not un-listenable, like another reviewer found them. I probably wouldn't run to buy this album before other Pet Shop Boys productions, but I give it 3.5 stars."
5,Rockin' your child will never be the same....,"This album is the only sanity parents of toddlers seem to have when choosing music for their children. It's great in the car and even funner in the living room for dancing. ""Doing the Flap"" is a great favorite with my son and even ""Wags the Dog"" is a huge hit with the 12 and 10 year old. When it comes to kid's music, this one ROCKS -- without rolling you over with old cliches and music that dulls vs stimulate those creative juices"
2,Not for the well endowed,"There is nothing wrong with the bra per say, but it isn't a good choice for the well-endowed. It is over all too thin and weak to even sleep in."
2,"Too tricky to work one-handed, and makes you look odd-shaped...","I don't have a ton to compare this to, as I only used one other kind of nursing bra, but I found this one difficult to work with. The snaps are not one-hand accessible at all and when you're learning how to nurse, it's too complicated to try and stay covered and snap them back up with two hands. And the pieces underneath the top panel make your whole bust area look an unnatural shape. It's weird. There isn't any support at all, so for non-supportive nursing bras, I prefer the ones without any snaps that you just pull open from the middle. They don't have any support either, but at least you don't look like you're all lumpy up front."
4,Very comfortable nursing bra,"I wasn't sure about this bra when I bought it (while pregnant) - it is not very supportive, and I was used to wearing underwire bras every day. Now that I am nursing, this is the bra I wear every day. I was a 34DDD before I got pregnant - now I'm a 34J and the XL size of this bra fits perfectly. It creates a definite 'uniboob', so I wear a different bra when I leave the house, but this bra is perfect for sleeping and wearing around the house. The clasps come undone on their own pretty regularly, and the spandex does get stretched out after about 8 months of washing and wearing, but other than that the bra is made well."
5,Surprised!,"I received this CD as a present at a luncheon and I didn't even know who Raul DiBlasio was. I could not believe that I didn't know about this wonderful pianist. I love every single piece to the point that it is my favorite CD ever. It is relaxing, but at the same time powerful. I love the mix of different styles among one CD. It incorporates many well known singers along with solos. I ended up buying every single CD he has ever produced."
4,The Book of Ezekiel,"One of the best installments in the Amazing Spider-man Series - I had been waiting a long time to get this, Ezekiel is one of the most loveable and enjoyable characters in the series and it was a nice touch to give him almost an entire volume to clear up the mysteries.This book brings to light all of the strange paranormal happenings that Spidey had faced in previous volumes. The ending seems a bit rushed, and some fans will be left pretty depressed with the major turn in the story, but nonetheless it's a fun and gripping edition and totally worth the buy"
3,Different.....,"It was neat to see then 10 years older, but I miss the babies! One big change is Angelica's mom! She looked like death warmed over... I caught this on Nick a week ago and I erased the tapes after I watched them... It was a let down in terms of quality too.. Spike should not be that fat anyway... I think that it was a good try to keep the rugrats going, but I will stick with the babies instead..."
5,Great book about the ONLY way to train athletes!,"So much training in the U.S. is dominated by bodybuilding practices and principles. In ""Explosive Lifiting for Sports,"" Newton breaks down the ONLY way to train athletes, EXPLOSIVELY, with much of the training being dominated by Olympic Lifting (the Clean and Jerk and the Snatch.) It is a refreshing read and is a must have for any coach who wants to decrease a teams susceptibility to injury and improve their performance."
1,the cd is not working on my comp and also my player,"good book but cd is not working, could be only in my case,so don go by my review alone, this author is good"
2,Disapointed in binding,Before I could use the dictionary I had to do a repair on the first dozen sheets.I would like to have sent it backbut I needed the dictionary plus I was afraid that a replacement would have the same defective binding.
1,Not what I expected.,"I guess you get what you pay for.First off,Taylor CLAIMS that the remote will work up to 100' away from the base station.After moving the remote several times,optimum distance was more like 25'feet.On the plus side,indoor temp readings were fairly accurate.Negative side-outdoor accuracy was WAY off--usually about 10 degrees lower than standard outdoor thermometer.Not worth the price of shipping it back for a refund.Do NOT reccomend."
2,"Handy, but not very accurate","I have the base unit and three remote units, one for outside temps, one in a detached garage, and one for a hot tub. The base unit and garage units are ok (+/- 1.5 degrees) but the outside one is nearly impossible to mount and get an accurate air temp. It is influenced by what ever you mount it on or close to. I tried mounting it on the shady side of a cedar fence board but the sun hitting the board from the back raised the temp over 10 degrees. At night, it works fine. I use the probe for the hot tub but it is consistantly 5 degrees to high (when compared to an NIST calibrated thermometer, and the built in hot tub sensor). Swaped out all three units and got the same result. As far as the signal transmission part is concerned, the only way to get near the 100' claim is to have them in line-of-sight (NO obstructions), otherwise don't expect more than about 20/25 feet. I have had the system about a month."
1,Music from the boys but not for the fans...,"...a very boring album without any brilliance. like the last album also this was a disappointing shopping-experience. if u check in the psbs live acts u will soon see the crow yawn when they play their new tunes. they have no energy, no real passion, no psb. i can only pseak for the uk and germany where this album failed and is now available for a few bucks as noone is really interested in it.mind the disc - go back in the better days of psb (highlight ""VERY"" and ""RELENTLESS"")"
3,How Sad,"""Release"" is something you'd listen to after attending a 4-year-old's funeral for her goldfish- you feel kind of morbid, but can't help chuckle a little at the circumstance. The circumstance of Release- melancholy B-sides that just don't quite catch on. The CD is a far cry from Nightlife, Bilingual, and Very- Release is a slower paced, guitar oriented, sing along for break ups.""I Get Along,"" ""Love Is A Catastrophe,"" and ""E-mail"" deal with relationships gone wrong, or relationships about to go wrong. It's kind of hard to enjoy the tongue-in-cheek poke at Eminem ""The Night I Fell In Love,"" when sadness sandwiches the song, but you may get a small chuckle out of it. If you're looking for a good weep, get the CD, but if you're looking for something with a little more depth, check out other Pet Shop Boy releases."
3,"Better than ""Nightlife"", but so what","After listening to this CD, I was not moved at all. Tracks 1 and 6 are decent; ""Home And Dry"" - a dreary but well constructed tune and ""The Samurai In Autumn"" - that reminded me of great PSB albums like ""Introspective"" and ""Behavior"". But, alas, most of the tracks in Release remind me of a little girl's maudlin poem about Unicorns or her pet cat. It's like Pet Shop Boy's music done by Yanni or John Tesh (Brrrrrrr!), when you caught them on a good day.Too bad.The second CD, containing some real lame remixes, is as uninspiring as the new material."
5,They're back after they lost it in BILINGUAL and NIGHTLIFE.,"This is the PSB you grew up on. They maintained loyalty to the sound that's distinctively PSB. I think they deviated from their sound with BILINGUAL and NIGHTLIFE. I am so glad they're back!If you love the PSB, you should buy this CD!"
5,Discover what's Hidden!,"A very moving and epic story. Victoria Lustbader is not only a wonderfully gifted writer, she understands the human condition."
5,"Fabulous, Entertaining and Stimulating Read","When I picked up this book I was hooked from the first page. Ms. Lustbader's style of writing transported me onto the page and into the heart and soul of every character. I was enthralled, in love and enticed by certain characters, and loathed others - which of course, for me, allows me to travel into another world. The author also very coyly and inteligently inserts strategically placed ""life lessons"" which serve to kindle enlightening and entertainingly inspirational motivation. Mysterious, inspiring, flowing, entertaining and definitely a page turner."
4,Mixed,This game is a mix between some of the best RPGs of the GBA. It is mixed with pokemon because of method of travel. Dragon Warrior because of the battle sequences. And Mega Man Battle Network because of the cut-scenes. I hope you like this game.
4,The book was well written. A good book to start a series.,"Like most of Vornholt's work;he has multiply plot lines. This requires you to concentrate on the book more than normal;but once you get use to it,it's not so bad.The story it's self is background to the story line of DeepSpace 9 for the last two years."
3,Book 1,"This was a great book! It is great to see how the Dominion War affected the crew of the Enterprise. Ever since the Enterprise-E was in service there has only been 3 movies of the new starship, and countless novels. I am a Voyager fan, so I thought it was important to read what was also going on in the Alpha Quadrant at this time (when Voyager was lost at sea), and how people back at home were handling things. I think though the Dominion Conflict is better served through the eyes of Captain Sisko and DS9, than Picard and the Enterprise. But this was another great book that played well into the Dominion conflict! I didn't enjoy ""Tales of the Dominion War"" as much as I did these 4 books."
3,If it holds my sorry butt it must be good,Definitely useful if you have problems maintaining balance in the shower. Very heavily built and capable of holding a very large person. The 550 pounds is no exaggeration. It was and is indeed too short. I was aware that it would only extend to 17 inches but thought it would be adequate. It really isn't. At 17 inches I need help getting up from the bench when done in the shower. I'm keeping it as it works fairly well but would be MUCH more comfortable with about 3 inches more height. If it was adjustable to 20 inches it would be a 5 star purchase. As it is it will be a 3 star...
3,not good for arthritis people 5'6 and taller,this was much shorter then i expected. if you are 5'6 or taller you will have difficulty getting up. it seems very sturdy but i need sturdiness and height
2,ok,I haven't used it much but seems to be an interesting read with some good points. I don't think I would buy it again though.
1,Disks lasted less than two seconds,"I bought this to cut some metal in very close quarters. Knowing that putting lateral pressure on the disks would probably destroy them, I worked very carefully trying to keep the disk exactly in the saw cut.However, the metal collar that the mandrel slips through kept tearing through the side of the disks rendering them useless. None of them lasted more than a few seconds. After that the metal collar was practically impossible to remove from the mandrel. This idea looked good on paper but at least the batch that I got was of very poor quality.What did work were the smaller fiberglass-reinforced Dremel cutoff wheels. No fancy mandrel or metal collar to rip out, but they got'er done."
3,"I am pleased with the performance, not with the price or packaging","So I have used these before, and I like to use them when I have some small metal pieces to work on. However I am rating this at 3 stars because I only received 4 discs inside a package that explicitly states 5 ea. The price is also a tad bit to high, probably only worth 7.50$/pack."
5,"Well-made, Rugged & Detailed!","I just got these Indigo RIGGS jeans based on the reviews...and I am glad I did!They are excellent quality [made in Mexico with US components], lots of extra details, like protective edging on the front right pocket [for tape measure clip] and rear pockets, hammer loop, deep reinforced pockets, heavy 100% cotton...and they are loose where they need to be when you need to be active. They tend to be a touch larger in the waist [for me, at least: I got the 31Wx32L and 30Wx32L might have been a better fit] so if you are on the fence, I suggest you go for the smaller size.Edit: After about a month of wear...and especially after working on my leaking water heater...these pants really hold up! The extra gusseting in the crotch, the lined & reinforced back pockets, and the tape measure clip guard on the right-side front pocket all spell q-u-a-l-i-t-y!"
3,They removed the side pocket,"I love these jeans or I did. I have bought about seven pair of these jeans over the last two years. I found they fit better than any jeans I have owned. I bought a pair about two weeks ago, and was very disappointed.I found out they have deleted the side leg pocket. That was one of the big selling points for me. I used that pocket for a few tools I carried at work. The five star jeans just went to three stars. I guess I am now looking for new work jeans. PUT THE POCKET BACK ON."
3,English grammar improvement guaranteed,This book will help anyone understand the principles behind the English language. You do not have to be a Latin student to understand this book.
5,Makes great slime!!!,"I bought this for a class project and it worked beautifully. Makes beautiful, translucent slime.I definitely recommend this product."
3,Dark side of Texas with a confused hero,"Jack Flippo owes his mentor Wesley Joy and when Wesley asks for his help, Jack has to respond. Except Wesley is in jail and suspected of murder--and Jack isn't quite sure whether Wesley is really as innocent as he claims. Wesley claims his wife, Angelique, can provide an alibi, and Jack sets off to find her-- with a bit of self-interest in mind.Jack's confusion only gets worse when he poisons himself on raw oysters. This food poisoning limits Jack for half the book and puts a bit of a damper on the entire novel. Throughout, Jack seems more driven by others than driving the story himself. The rain of murdered bodies that seem to crop up wherever Jack goes mystifies him, but never really drives him to wonder what is going on.Doug Swanson is a good writer and moves the story forward. Despite Jack's anti-heroics, the reader will still want to find out what is going on and will find themselves, like Jack, wavering on who, if anyone, really is innocent."
4,dont foget to lube the seams,"best on the market, for canning. DONT USE FOR COOKING, ALUMINUM is bad for you. 4 stars becuz its not stainless steelYou could cook a 2 year old child in this thing! wooooooohoooo"
1,Fry cutter,"The first time I used it, it bent and didn't even cut the potato. I tried to straighten it out, but to no avail. I threw it in the trash!!"
2,Not so Much,Busted the first time I used it on potatoes. Microwave them first so they're a little soft and it kinda works.
4,Riveting!,"Thomas Pitt is called upon to investigate the murder of a prostitute in the same part of London where the Jack the Ripper murders had occurred, in this page-turner. Pitt's services are required due to the political sensitivity of investigating the son of a prominent family. Although I had anticipated much of the conclusion, the final unfolding of events was nonetheless riveting.In order to understand the primary characters, it is helpful to read some of the earlier works in the series first. That caveat aside, this is an enjoyable read."
3,An average book,"I used this book in a graduate course on Stochastic processes. The book would rate as average or just above that as I found it to be insufficient for a start in the subject unless you were in a classroom course. It does assume some background in probabilty. Also, the explanations, while complete, are not as easy to understand as the Roos book. I also found that the examples were extremely easy as compared to the excersice problems. THis makes it tougher to 'extrapolate' and understand. It has one nice feature though- solutions to half the problems are there at the end of the book making it better for students while giving faculty leeway too. The excercises are quite comprehensive too. I'd say this is an excellent book for someone with some prior knowlede of Stochastic Processes. For a beginner, this may not be the best start."
4,Get your feet wet,"A great introduction to the world of DMT and other psychedelics. I recommend other reading, as this got somewhat boring."
3,Theories,"You notice at the top of the reviews page it says 'theories' which is just what they are are, a theory is a guess by someone else and it really means that they don't know what they are really talking about."
3,Surprised at The Size,"When I received this truly pocket sized booklet I was surprised at the cost of such a small edition. In it's credit, it does contain alot of memory aids, flight calculation tables, checklists, pertinent FAA regs, abbreviations, weather minimums etc. for VFR and IFR pilots. I give credit to the author and publisher for compacting so much into a small space. Myself personnaly, would probably use it for quick reviews and memory aids while not in motion or as a general refresher out of the cockpit."
1,The worst online experience I've ever had,"This brand new, factory fresh, out of the box Sharp R426LS Microwave, simply did not work. What was troubling was the manufacturer denyed any responsibility and suggested shipping the microwave back to theretailer. After 3 weeks of attempting to get a return authorization from the retailer, I'm still holding on to a very large box. My suggestion is never buy through a third party like Amazon. Obviously, they won't take responsibility either."
4,Sharp Microwave,"I really like this microwave other than it is noisy.Looks great with other stainless, cleans easily many settings.However, the turn table and the motor are loud ccompared to my previous oven."
3,Just my opinon!,"You get what you pay for. I ordered two and one worked the other has to be rewired.The smoker has to set their cig, in the tray not keep in the hand .As a smokers habit is to hold it.. you do have to clean often and use rechargable batteries hey suck the juice.. They do work if used correctly.Amazon's Service was amazing..Thank you.."
4,Review on the cherry pitter,"The item came on time and worked just fine. My cherries were super large, so I had to line them up with the extractor. A lot easier then I thought it would be."
4,Faster than pitting by hand,This is a good product that does exactly what it's supposed to do. It is way faster than pitting by hand but if you get carried away you can jam it up. Also you need to make sure to thoroughly dry it after you clean it so it doesn't rust.
3,Short lessons,"Not as good as DVD 1. It spends over 50% of the time reviewing with too little grogress. Over all, it keeps its style easy to follow on one hand and, on the other, it lacks plotting and seriousness which dispoints viewers."
3,Not really my favorite work by Stefano ...,"I have about eleven Alio Die CDs, most of whichyou can't find on Amazon, and yet I've always felt thatUnder an Holy Ritual - Alio's ""second"" release - was one ofhis least inspired overall (with the 'major' exception ofRitual's stellar and haunting opening track, ""InitiationBy Light"" (I guess I favor his more 'haunting' work); butaside from a potent opener, the rest of this disc fellflat for me.Well, things began to look up after his album with workssuch as the Flight of Real Image (ep),5000 Spirits (w/ Runes Order), Door of Possibilities, LeStanze Della Trancendenza etc.I've probably been too critical of Holy Ritual; it is definitly worth a listening too and forming one's own opinion, especially if you've heard the work of Alio before."
5,The Neon Rain,"This book is ""S-O-O-O New O'lins!!!"" IF you like the N.O. ""haunts"" of Dave Robicheauz and his friend? Clete ... YOU will love this book! Yes, it is one of Burke's earlier mysteries, but (speaking a ""relatively-new-native"" of the Greater New Orleans Area) YOU just know these characters and you can see them for real on the streets in the Quarter !!! A quick, delightful read !!!"
3,SO-SO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1,"This is the first James Lee Burke book I have read. Everybody said read them in order and they will mean more. Part of this book was so great I did not want to put it down and part of it was so bad, to me, I wanted to put it down. Dave Robicheaux may be smart in some ways but not very bright in other ways. I could not believe that twice he got the stuffing beat out of him when he was not watching what he was doing or the people around him. He fights bad cops, a mob, has a contract on his life and a new girlfriend. Hi does take things in his own hands. The ending was very good, I liked it. I think he needs a ""Hawk"" if you get my drift. Guess I will try the next one, the good parts are great reading."
2,Only time I recommend skipping the first in a series...,"A bookseller in Washington D.C. recommended Burke to me. She said ""you'll love this character."" I thought, a cop running around New Iberia Louisiana? No way. I've been to New Iberia and there's nothing there! But I decided to give it a try and started with the first in the series (Neon Rain). I almost couldn't get through it. This is a poorly written cop story, set in New Orleans, where Robicheaux is a drunken homicide Lt. It has none of the charm or style of the books that follow. Fortunately, Robicheaux decides to move to New Iberia in the second book, and the series really takes off and starts scoring strikes. New readers just discovering James Lee Burke's cajun hero might want to skip ""Neon Rain"" and pick up the series with ""Heaven's Prisoners."" You won't be missing much, if anything."
2,The stone was breaking off when the packing was opened,I personally will not recommend this product because it looks very susceptible to wear and tear. I had to return the product the next day of its arrival.
5,Great price Fast Shipping,It is very hard to find any sunscreen with an SPF lower than 15. I wanted some protection but wanted to maximize my tan. This was great and it smells yummy!
1,Back to the Drawing Board!!!,"This is a nifty idea; unfortunately, it just doesn't work out. The blades are very sharp, but even then, the pressure necessary to grate cheddar from a block is too much for this gadget. Press too lightly, you get nothing; press too heavily, and the blade simply stops. Maybe there's some technique that can be learned with time, but using this contraption shouldn't require that kind of effort. It needs a stronger motor, and/or a better way to convert the circular motion of the motor to the up-and-down movement necessary for grating to occur. All I can say to Black and Decker is try again, and get it RIGHT.Edit as of 12 Apr 2007 - finally threw this thing out; I think I might have used it a half-dozen times, and it wasn't doing anything more than taking up space."
1,Gizmo? Shizmo!,"This thing is terrible! I wanted a nice shredder/grater since I lost my Salad Shooter and could not find a new one in a local store. My mom got me the Gizmo Grater for my birthday and it is horrible! It hardly grates and I could do a better job using my old silver hand grater! But, that aside, it is almost impossible to clean the metal graters after you are done--and cheese does get stuck. Not a good product! Im going to find my Salad Shooter! I don't even think this is worth one star :("
1,dont waste your money,"It bacame clogged within seconds, I was able to do more with a hanheld in 30 seconds than i did in 5 minutes with this junk!!!!!!"
1,Gizmo Schmizmo,"This thing stinks. It is quite possibly the worst kitchen appliance ever invented. Black and Decker...shame on you!Where could one start to describe how horribly designed yet so magnificently marketed this abomination is. Kudos to the Black and Decker marketing team who manages to sell this worthless waste of an invention.Since I have not been able to grate more than 6 or 7 shreds of cheddar with this thing...I have since been trying to figure out another use for it. Maybe shaving the mud off the bottom of my shoes when I come in from outside although I doubt it is strong enough to handle it.If anyone else has any alternate ideas that this ""gizmo"" can be used for, please share.If you don't believe how much of a waste this is, but it for yourself and join the rest of us who have been endlessly frustrated by purchasing it.Black and Decker...if you read this I would love to read your rebuttal."
1,Does not work,I have tried and tried to use this to grate cheese. Do not buy it for this because it does not work at all. I think I will try to get my money back because I had to buy a hand grater instead.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK,This product does not work at all. I called Black & Decker and asked for a refund or a different product of equal value and all they could tell me was that they could send me a new one. Well after reading negative feedback on different website I told them I didnt want a new one. They said thats the best they could do. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY on this piece of junk. Black and Decker has definitly lost me as a customer!
3,Good food for thought if you can get past the writing,"I read this book out of curiousity mostly. Considering it was written several hundred years ago, it was a challenge to get over the dry writing. There isn't a story here as much as a listing of daily practices and customs in Utopia. Some silly, some almost ingenious.The underlying theme is an example of a perfect society; but at aprice - personal freedoms. What I also found interesting was that a few of the ideals contridicted themselves throughout the novel. Everyone is equal, except for the non-king rulers. If this is a perfect society, why would there be crime in the first place? War is bad and nonsense, except when Utopian government finds merit in it. Everyone seeks out knowledge, but they need permission to gain it.I found the writing very dry (most likely due to the period it was written) and almost like reading a text book. A good read however. Makes you think about personal freedoms versus a perfect society."
4,Zoemagik,"I love most all Zoemagik releases, this one was no exception. A hybrid blend of 'digital meets analog' and some nice uses of saxophones. Nice album to put on and go about your business. Nothing really ""smash hit"" about it but if you appreciate honest efforts and something different, give it a shot."
3,the opinion of a novice to new orleans music,"The best groups in the new orleans venue are galactic, and the new world funk ensemble, Aaron neville is most likely the best artist from that area. If you enjoy various artists jamming from the new orleans area with lead vocals who are not paticularly talented, you might wish to own this c.d."
3,Dubious Examples,"I think O'Reilly books are, in general, splendid. I have many of them for Microsoft Office products and Photoshop training.This book, in my opinion, suffers from poor examples. Often the results of an exercise look worse than the original photo. More often than not, I find the original more appealing than the modified one. The position of the original and modified versions are randomly positioned with the label ""original image"" often confusingly close to either image.It's a good book, but could be a lot better with more meaningful image improvements.Update 12/20/12I tried again on this book but would only recommend buying it used. The examples are pretty bad. I probably was generous in awarding 3 stars."
3,The Pick-Up Artist,"Cutesy Girl film but Robert Downey Jr. Is a Great Actor along side Molly Ringwald who apparently has no scruples in the movie.(She puts out after just meeting the guy)And Danny Aiello,Dennis Hooper,you also Have A young BLACK Haired Pauly from the Sopranos in it as well as Lorraine Braco(Saw the credits,but don't remember who she played,didn't even notice) I also didn't even notice Vanessa Williams(The lady walking the dog). I sincerely Doubt that the Camaro was such a Lemon in the movie, Anyhow,Girls would probably love this movie,I thought it was okay,I like Less Than Zero More."
1,Edited copy,Very disappointed. The movie has been dubbed from the original theatrical version. It was not advertised as such. I would not have purchased this DVD if I had known.
3,"Had much higher expectations, but a decent summary","Obviously, many books have been written about Churchill and many of them are very good but this one is a summary of his whole life in 330 pages. A glimpse of his life and I'm not sure it's well worth the time. If you want a summary, this book will fly by so many years and subjects, it will make your head spin. I think most people who want to read about Churchill will want to dive much deeper into the subject so that is why I wouldn't recommend this book."
2,not as cool as I thought it'd be...,"I used an avocado smaller than the tool, so I had to uncomfortably squeeze the tool until it'd fit. Then it kind of smooshed my avocado into slices that were not attractive, while leaving a layer of unused avocado in the shell.It made me realize that it's not *that* hard to slice an avocado with a paring knife... oh well."
5,Hot Rod Air Cleaner,"The perfect low-cost Hot Rod Air Cleaner!Ideal for multiple carb set-ups.""Old School"" look with high quality finish!"
4,It's In the Bag,"The fact that the cell phone in the picture is probably from the 80's? and too large for the pocket as well, made me a little leery about buying this bag. But I'm glad I did.If you're looking for a bag to organize small items, look elsewhere. There are a few small compartments but most of the bag consists of two ""large"" compartments, plus the one to hold a cell phone (or a brick). The strap is long enough to adjust it to wear cross shoulder style, for a more ""manly"" look. Other than the zippers getting caught on occasion, it works well for what I needed."
4,Yep...it is what it's supposed to be.,Yep...it is what it's supposed to be. Compact and efficient design. Useful to carry all of the necessary do-dads for travel.
4,Nice little bag for traveling,"I used this bag when we went to Egypt. It kept everything I needed without the extra weight of a purse. Plus, the color made it look like safari gear, which was cool.My only complaint was the enormous size of the cell phone holder. No one has cell phones that big anymore! I used it to hold sunglasses instead."
4,NIce Camera interesting experience,"The camera is os far a good camera, decent batt, nice picsdecent value overallMy first camera came obivously open used and .....broken the zoom was stuck openJR took their sweet time approving the return even though they were negligent......whatevereventually they made good and gave me a nice brand new onei'm happy now"
2,Horrible camera,"Has some great features such as Face Detection, motion-sensitive timer, large LCD screen, USB charging, adjustable ISO setting, but COULD NOT GET A GOOD PICTURE. The pictures all came out with little detail (my Coolpix 3100 3 megapixel blew this thing away!), shutter lag is way too long on auto mode (setting higher ISO yielded lower shutter lag, but images were still poor quality). Bottom line - the camera is fancy and has a lot of cool features, but cannot take a clear, quality photo. I have already put in for a return/refund and have already purchased a Canon Powershot A630 as a replacement. Lesson learned!!"
3,Decent...for the price.,"My only point of comparison are Canon cameras just so you know where I am coming from. I was trying to decide between this or the Canon SD1000. Finally, I decided on this because of cost. After using this camera for about 2 weeks, I should have bought the Canon. The handling of the camera is decent but there are just too many buttons and cheap, unnecessary features. The smart touch works well but I prefer the old wheel found on most cameras.Overall:Pros:-many features for the price. 7MP-looks great and well built-awesome high resolution video mode-the viewing screen is bright and high resCONS:-the shutter lag is just horrible-larger than the canon.-too many buttons. interface is not simple."
3,Unique and Fun Fluff,"MacHeads is a fine and fun exposé of the core groups that now constitute Apple's consumer sphere, and how they've changed and developed along with the company. Examined are the early adopters and ""old guard"" slowly dying user group faithful that stuck with the Macintosh throughout the uncertainty of the 90's, the new generation of users to whom a deep rooted user community is irrelevant so long as the products are sexy, and the comical zealots who would wait a week in line for a bottle of Steve Jobs' bathwater.Don't expect a history lesson on the company or products, as this film is all about the colorful folks on the user side of the keyboard and touch screen."
1,Very Disappointing,"Replaced a couple of test points on some PCBs and it worked great. Started a big project and one side of the ceramic tip broke off before I was even halfway done. $10 for a replacement tip? What a joke, I only paid $17 in the first place! This product definitely needs some work."
3,Answers many Questions concerning Arican-American parenting,"This book is actually a question and answer book. It has FAQ and the answers. I foud that many of the questions were right on time. I think I was expecting more of a narrative type of book, that is why I rated it 3 stars. Because I don't think it answered the most important question. How to raise Black Children."
2,press 13 please,"Great music to ride an elevator to. the accompaniment is very much robotic and emotionless. were there machines involved? I think so. I say pay the money, get the cats, and let the emotions run."
3,"Yeah sure, I enjoyed the game, but.......",".......I might as well have been playing King of Fighters '98 & '99. Honestly, I am just going to wait until the 2 new games come out: King of Fighters: Maximum Impact (King of Fighters goes Street Fighter EX style), or King of Fighters 2002/2003, both comming on September of 2004. It's cool to pick up and test out, but nothing serious."
1,Will not harden,I have had waxing done professionally for several months and after a lot of research decided I was ready to try it on my own. I invested in the mini Gigi warmer set which included a soft wax but I also bought the Dark Honee Wax b/c my hair is coarse and that's what my spa was using. I was so dissapointed with this wax I don't even know where to begin. It simply would not harden/dry. I even tried using muslin strips to try to get it off even though you shouldn't need those for hard wax. Result was ZERO hair removed. I know I'm not a pro but there is no way this stuff could do what it is supposed to do. Maybe I got a bad batch but I'm going to try another formula next time.
5,It seems to work,"It seems to work.. I have no way to gauge if it is truly accurate. :) However, when testing a water source before and after it entered our RO filter, it clearly showed that the RO filter was working. Have had this for about 4 months now and it has worked fine w no battery problems.It is good that it has a button to save your reading until you take it out of the water. Without that, sometimes it's hard to read the display while the meter is in the water container."
4,Really like it,It's great because it's tall enough so that my dog can eat while standing w/o hurting his neck. I just wish the bowls were a bit deeper or wider but other than that it really serves its purpose.
2,A Concise Chinese-English Dictionary for Lovers,"I didn't like this book. I do appreciate how difficult it is to learn any new language as an adult. However, the main characters were despicable."
3,"Like a Cross Between ""The Help"" and ""Fifty Shades of Grey""","It's a bit of an odd tale, and more racy than I expected. The broken English is a great technique, it makes you feel like you are right in the main characters shoes. This book is like a cross between The Help and Fifty Shades of Grey"
5,More than blood and fangs: it reaches your soul.,"I passed Stainless to a friend who at first wasn't that enthousiastic about reading ""another vampire novel"". She was blown away.It was so deep and moving that she didn't want it to end.Stainless goes way beyond the genre. While keeping the codes of the vampire fiction, it transgresses its clichés and makes it a truly deep literary novel, brilliantly served by Grimson's poetic and original prose.A romantic tragedy (in the best highest sense) for both vampire lovers and lovers of contemporary literature."
3,Not a bad book on the vampire / goth scene.,"A vampire and her lover amidst trashy LA goth types.The lead characters are rather hollow, and the goth characters are ugly and unsympathetic. There's also an evil vampire whom the goths end up serving, to their misfortune.I guess this book is supposed to be a commentary of some sort on the vapid LA lifestyle. Sort of like LESS THAN ZERO with fangs. Lots of bored ""been there, done that"" characters on the fringes of the music scene.It's not a ""heavy"" or ""literary"" as the author seems to intend, but it reads well. Not a bad book if trashy goth types interest you."
5,"The best comedy ever, even for old chicks","I'll never understand why this movie wasn't wildly popular. When I saw it, the audience was absolutely rocked with laughter. In fact, I had to see the video to catch things I missed because I could barely hear. Admittedly, I was one of the only women laughing, but most women need to lighten up... it's just a movie!My only complaint about the video is that the coloration and sound didn't translate very well. This movie was utterly gorgeous on the big screen. It had fabulous club scenes. Whoever edited it did a superb job. I'm glad there were so many other positive reviews. I too would love to see a sequel. Andrew Dice Clay has gone on to make fairly mediocre movies since then, and I have hardly heard of him. Someone said Lauren Holly was unnoticed. I don't agree with that, I thought she was fantastic, and added a lot to the movie. Everyone in it was great."
5,A Classic`,"Dice Clay shows that he can act in Ford Fairlane. The story line is great and the lines that are used are great. Wayne Newton is also a plus and he adds so much to the movie. The car a 1957 Ford Fairlane Hard Top retractable is a great looking car and a classic, it adds spunk to the rock &roll P.I. . Robert( Freddy Kruger) plays a awsome sicko and he is quite interesting. Lauren Holly is great and she is hot. This is a must own for any Dice fan, or if you love a great story and great lines this film is for you. Enjoy!"
5,Clint Eastwood...I....,"This has to be one of my favorite films. Mr Ford Fairlane, Rock 'n' roll detective has to come to DVD soon! This movie is a classic, the humor of Dice Clay, coupled with the 80's rock business...you simply can't go wrong. Everyone from the pussy cats to Tone loc are great, and though ford diggs...well you get the picture. He busts a brain vessel everytime booty time walks his Al Bundy butt into the room, and speaks the fine words of todays society - SO MANY *********...SO FEW BULLETS!This FILM ROCKS and BETTER COME OUT ON DVD SOOOOOONNN!"
5,"""They Got The Bonus Plan, OAHH!!!""","This movie is Dice at his finest. Robert Englund also adds humor to this as the badguy. Pracilla Presley and Lauren Holly are here for support. Dice plays a Sambuca drinking, heavy smokin rock and roll detective investigating a shady string of events in the Hollywood area, and looking for ZU ZU PETALS. Landmarks seen here include the Capital building, used in a descent fight scene. Overall, you have to get this film. I got it on clearence VHS for 50 cents at a national chain. So sit down, pop this into you DVD/VHS and ""SHAKE ME!!!!"""
5,A Different Janis,"Much better CD than Janis' Greatest Hits collection. While there are no live performances, the selection of songs from her studio CD's is excellent. However, for me, a fanatical Janis fan, what makes this CD worthwhile is Janis' letters. These letters show a side of Janis not always in line with her public image of 60's icon. They remind us of the human being behind the legend."
1,WHAT?,"hi, just short note... i bouht this cd. i must say that collection of the song is good. BUT why someone else is reading janises letters? oh my god. its digusting. if they want to let people know, what janis wrote to her family, they can print it into booklet. i really do not like idea where you are listening to song of janis joplin and in next track, there is a woman changing voice, pretending that shes janis.... shame on you good luck Columbia"
3,But not remarkable book,"The photos are fine, not stunning. The text is informative without being enchanting. For trees the author finds remarkable, one would think his thoughts and observations would have been a bit more remarkable as well."
4,You Won't Find Anything Objective in This Review,"This cd benefits from not being overly reworked. Ysaye's sonatas sound best when you hear the violin creaking, as if being played nearby, and I think these by Bolognese come closer than any others I've heard.Proclivity toward all things violin a prerequisite to Ysaye, I would think."
4,Good buy,"This looks very nice and has lots of space inside. It holds both DS game cartridges and several GBA ones, as well. There are inserts you put in the main compartment to secure the DS Lite - nice feature.My ten year old granddaughter loves it."
3,Great carry case,Not being a very organized person this is a great item to have. Carry your Nintendo DS in safety.
3,Good but could be better,I really liked everything about this case save the thing that hold your games. Mine was so tight it was hard to get any of the games out. It might no be too bad if you don't mind struggling to get them in and out but it got to be such a hassle because I tend to switch games a lot. Also if you like to keep your games in any kind of order it's a nightmare to add a new game. I could easily get all my stuff and then some into this case. If it weren't for the game holder this would be almost perfect! If you are looking for something to keep your system in order this is great but I'd have to give the game holder a poor rating. So basically a GREAT case that includes a BAD game holder.
1,Nothing Glorious about Old Glory,"I have to admit I was thrilled to join Raban on his journey down the ""mighty mac,"" but after he left the locks south of Red Wing he was on his own. The book appealed to my sense of adventure, but I guess I'm too happy a guy to identify with this damp Englishman. His observations were continually pessimistic and cynical. I only envied his thirst for smalltown beer and peanuts. If you want to shake your head for a week, open her up and give it a rip."
1,Cheap Junk,"The cover was broken when I recieved this ""case"". although it was packaged very well. It is made of the same flimsy material as you get bake goods in at a supermarket. Molded bottom and very cheap top.Not at all something you would expect a model train case to be."
5,Great watch at a great price,"Great watch at a great price. Beautiful see-through caseback shows the Swiss ETA2824 movement and is great for showing your friends who aren't watch enthusiasts what an ""automatic"" movement is.I got the leather band but now I'm thinking the bracelet might have been a good idea because it's been very hot recently and sweat is drenching the leather band."
1,un called for !,this game does not work on newer computers and the company cant do anything about it. if you own a computer newer then 2000 do not buy this game !
1,VERY Disappointing,"This will probably be the last Synergy DVD I will purchase. The video quality is poor, and the shows are getting newer, even the color era, but presented in black and white. The TRUE black and white shows from the 50s and early 60s were great, and the color shows ONLY had color going for them. These color shows aren't even in color!If some great old 50s Welk shows, especially ""Top Tunes And New Talent"", aka ""The Plymouth Show"" are released, I may buy some more. I see Volume 4 is out with some even NEWER ""color"" shows. I will not waste my money or time on them. C'mon Synergy, you did a good job, especially with the Christmas shows, you can do it again, and PLEASE, NO MORE post 1965 color shows in black and white."
1,i cant complain about the price but the quality?,when i got the charger it worked at a angle when pluged in and the next day the part that connects into the phone came apart with ease.if anyone buys this item make sure you super glue/tape it or itll copme apart and their no repairing this.trust me..
4,Lots of worthwhile instruction,"After reading the reviews on Series 1, I decided to jump right to this Series 2 Collection. There is a quick review of the Series 1 instruction before each dance, so if you have any dance talent you'll pick it up quickly. The instructors don't waste time with tedious steps so you don't get bored during each lesson. Lots of dances! I thought the purchase was well worth the money."
4,Excellent Prequel.,"If you played the game and loved it you will love this game. Even if you didn't, the movie is still set up for someone to jump in, get to know the characters, and enjoy it. It does exactly what a Prequel should by foreshadowing the game and letting you get to know the characters as they were and how they became to be. The plot is very good (In my opinion) and ties very well into the ToV universe.The one problem I have is that the voices of Rita and Raven are not the same voice actors that they were in the game. Sure, they didn't have big parts in the movie and they we're done very well by the actors who portrayed them, it's just disappointing for a fan like me to hear Rita sound different.That one thing is very irrelevant and this movie is worth buying. I highly recommend it for any fan of the Video game, of anime, or anyone who just enjoys a good movie,"
1,don't waste your time or money!,"I bought this microwave less than three years ago. After about 6 months it broke and I had to bring it to a service center to be repaired (just stopped heating). It was under warranty but still a huge inconvenience to bring it in. Now less than two years later the same problem is happening and it's no longer under warranty. I won't waste my time getting it fixed when it will probably cost the same amount of money to buy a new one. I really hate the attitude of ""just buy a new one."" Things should be made to last, not so cheaply so that you just buy a new one when it breaks. I'll never buy a Sharp microwave again."
1,unsafe microwave,I believe this microwave to be a fire hazard. A cooking menu was set in the device for 2.5 min. and left unattended. I returned after 20 min. and noted that the display was not working and that the ceramic dish containing the bacon that was being cooked was charred and in pieces. The plastic shield in front of the oven was also melted indicating a high heat. The manufacturer could easily protect the device by inserting thermostatic protection circuitry in its electronics.
2,Looks great but failed....,"This unit was installed in August 2008. Worked great in a remodeled kitchen. Last week the unit started sparking (when heating coffee) and burned a hole inthe side interior panel. Of course the warranty is up. Minimun cost to have it checked out, $70.00 at a Sharp authorized repair location. Being the contractor whoremodeled the kitchen, I'm now faced with having recommended a product which has performed poorly. We have had good reliability with Sharp microwaves in thepast but feel we cannot recommend them any longer. Another good brand bites the dust........"
2,Wish it were reliable - and safe!,"We loved this microwave - sensor system was a treat to use, the sleek design was what we wanted, and it did the job so much better than the outdated micro it replaced. But recently (after about 20 months and warrantee expired, of course) it's decided to turn itself off whenever - no predicting it - and needs to be reset from the ""enjoy your new oven"" message (how ironic is that?!). It's a real pain, but nowhere near the safety issue others have described. Guess we'll move on to another brand, based on reviews here. Sorry it didn't work out, tho."
3,Fit but flimsy,"These fit on the mini-muffin tins perfectly and once placed in the tins, they are flawless. Unfortunately, separating them is a challenge. They are very thin and stick together, when pulled from the packaging. Care must be taken, otherwise you will have many torn baking cups that are useless."
2,Sansui 27-inch TV,I loved this tv because it was a perfect fit and had a great picture. But only lasted one year
2,Waste of my time...,"Pros: It's an iron that works without the waterCons: Water dripped, stainless-steel suface got damaged, hard to use knobs and buttons.Trust me I searched everywhere from Walmart, Costco, Target and Home Depot. Foun it at Target and got it because of these revies but when I got home, the water leaked when I held it at a small angle, after 1 hour of use, the surface became rough and damaged, and the middle knob under the handle was VERY hard to turn."
1,High Failure Rate,"I've ordered two of these in succession based on Consumer Reports' recommendations. Both have failed in less than a year. I have asked B&D for warranty information. Interestingly enough, there is no warranty information that I can find on the B&D website and this iron is apparently no longer manufactured by B&D. I am very disappointed with my experience."
1,Fire Hazzard,"Got this a few months ago - it worked really well until yesterday. I was ironing for a couple of minutes and the iron started to beep repeatedly and the display went out. I tried to shut it off and it wouldnt' stop so I had to unplug it. I have emailed the company and am waiting to hear back. I have read reviews and see that many others have had this problem too. This is my 2nd b&d - the first one spit and leaked, now this. I'm going to try a different brand."
1,mine spits water and steam died,I wanted to second the comments of the others - this is a fancy digital iron that seemed nice for the first month or two - it quickly went down hill and now doesn't do the basics.
2,Water Spitting Is A Distinct DIS-Advantage,"I am in complete agreement with the comments of the customer who noted the problems with the adjustable steam setting dial being so loose that it moves while one is ironing, and even more annoyingly, the iron's penchant for spitting frequently and excessively during use, regardless of whether one has filled the tank with tap or distilled water. The irony (pun not intended but unavoidable) about this situation is that before purchasing this model, I had owned a twenty dollar Black & Decker iron that for over 10 years had never spit. The only reason that I finally had to replace it is that it eventually began to spit brown spots, no doubt from years of sediment accumulation. Because that Black & Decker iron served me so well, I assumed that a more expensive one with an auto cleaning feature would be even better, but sadly, that has not proven to be the case."
2,Automatic Clean annoying,The iron works well until the automatic cleaning displays. I don't seem to get much ironing done before the cleaning message is displayed and then it takes several instances to get it to turn off. The instructions say to let the iron heat for 3 minutes before starting the cleaning and then 2 minutes to cool once you're finished. That's over 5 minutes to get through the cleaning process and sometimes it has to be done several times. It seems to require cleaning fairly often. Very annoying.
1,Lasted only 3 months,I purchased this iron in April 2007 and today (July 2007)as I was ironing it started to beep repeatedly and quit working. At least I was there when this happened and had no fire issues.
2,Don't waste your money!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Purchased this iron and thought it was great.. until I was ironing one night and told my husband it was on fire..fortunately it was not on fire but the iron had burned up inside and started beeping repeatedly. Do yourself a favor and spend a little more money for a rowenta-it will pay off in the long run.
2,Fire Fire,"I love the way it irons, but it isn't worth the risk of burning the house down,, 2 have burnt up in the past year, and forget the warrenty it will cost you more to return it than the 10.00 one they send back ( you don't get the same one back) ( postage plus fee)"
4,A real Iron,"I haven't had this iron very long but the first thing that caught my attention about it was it's weight. I've wanted a heavier iron for a long time and it seems like they stopped making them. Also, the surface is really smooth and makes the iron glide across your clothes. No problems so far and I am very pleased with it."
1,Broken,My Iron did not work when I pluggged it in. I have returned it and have not yet recieved credit
2,Failed prematurely,"I purchased this iron within the last 3 or 4 years and I have used it only used occassionally. It still looks like new and worked well until now. Much to my surprise, the power switch suddenly has failed. Even though the power light stays ""on,"" the iron will not power on. I called the 800 number on the instruction sheet, but they said I'm out of luck if the iron is more than one year old. Needless to say, I won't buy another B&D iron."
3,Cord Problem,"Because of the location of the cord, the one I have started shorting out if the cord isn't in a certain position. It is past the warranty. When I called the company, they informed me there is no authorized service in my area and I would have to replace it. I liked the iron except for this flaw."
2,Problems with It,"After very few uses, perhaps 10, the steam has stopped working. I'm going back to my eight-dollar iron; glad I saved it. No, I haven't tried to make good on the warranty, nor get it fixed; just don't have time, and who needs the hassle. Don't recommend it for that reason."
5,Best iron ever!,"I consulted Consumer Reports (11/06) and this iron is the top rated and a ""best buy."" I've been ironing for over 50 years and love it. The adjustable steam on any heat is wonderful as is its balance while using. It heats up super fast and holds a copious amount of water for steam."
2,Alexandra - The Made for TV Movie in Book Form,"On the positive side, the narrative in 'Alexandra - the Last Tsarina' certainly offers a sense of high drama. But after a while, we get a very wooden impression of its characters - or is that caricatures? Nicholas II is very much a secondary figure here, served chiefly by the heterodox assertion that he was a weak ruler. The sentence 'She worried about Alexei' becomes an almost banal, repeated understatement.One wonders if this book was really meant to read like an historical novel produced for the mass market. It certainly does, and this may explain the factual errors, truncations of time, and elisions of events that make the text so difficult for admirers of the last Tsar and his family to read through without a growing disappointment. Granted, Robert Massie and his thorough treatment is a hard act to follow, but if the present book was fiction, why didn't someone say so?"
2,"Cute, but runs small",My son was only able to wear this once because the size ran small. He was in 3-month Carters outfits and the 6-12 month of these scrubs barely fit him.
5,A favorite,My 2 1/2 year old loves this book. He takes it off the book shelf every time he goes to his grandparent's house. It is one of his favorite books. He is so entertained by Lewis and the beast. He even has parts of it memorized.
3,"Good story, trite treatment","Good story, beautifully written, but trite almost cliche treatment of the complexities of a 14-year-old boy and his single mother making significant life changes. Ending completely contrived, too earnest, too simple, too neat. Despised treatment of Melanin's burgeoning sexuality and his self-perception of his own body."
4,Research for the Beginner,"What makes the practice of nursing special? Nursing professionals will need to be able to answer this question if they are to take their place in the professional marketplace. Nursing research will be an integral part in helping to find those answers. Research is being used to change practice, education, and health policy. For most beginners, research is introduced in the baccalaureate or masters programs using large, voluminous, and wordy textbooks. This book is great for the beginner, clarifying terms in a simple and clear format. It also guides the reader in analyzing research. I strongly recommend this little book, which is full of information to help you get through those large textbooks."
4,70's music didn't always suck..,"Very good compulation. Heart's Crazy on You is a great bonus track but I don't understand the other two bonus tracks, especially Third I Blind; who was that thrown in for? Otherwise, a highly recommended CD!"
2,Not sure,"I am still not sure why I didn't like it. Because it has the information I was looking for, or at least some if it, maybe it was because how it was narrated. I can't tell exactly why."
4,Very Enjoyable!,"I quite liked Mr. Asakawa's book. It is funny, charming, and informative in a non-stereotypical way. If you are part JA, it is essential. If you are interested in multiracial identity and Japanese American identity I would recommend it for your library."
4,"Who was the ""real"" Sleep of Reason?","The reviewer below writes that the ""real"" Sleep of Reason was a band from 1988 from Washinton, DC. The Sleep of Reason reviewed here was formed in 1983 and broke up in 1985. The recordings on the this CD are from those two years so who really was the real Sleep of Reason?"
2,Not really helpful with recipes and what to eat,"I have severe candida overgrowth and severe eczema (caused by candida) and I am struggling in finding recipes that do NOT feed the yeast/candida and also don't aggravate the eczema. It's very disappointing to see that the author says sugar and starch feed candida and at the same time suggests fruits and starchy vegetables like beets and carrots. Totally contradictory. I agree with other reviewer that gave 1 star that said this author just want the person to see a doctor and to call the few laboratories to ask what doctor can help me in my area. :/A big book with not good information. There are much better books than this one. I recommend better ""The Yeast Syndrome"" and ""The Yeast Connection""."
3,Decent for Diet but Not a Complete Guidebook,"I really wanted to love this book and to have it live up to it's title as the complete guidebook for candida. However, it's just not. Thoughts below.What it is:- Great guide for a stringent candida diet with a lot of good recipes- Did I mention recipes galore?What it is not:- Outside of food, diet, and recipes, the book is quite weak- Very little explanative information about candidaI found myself constantly asking why this and why that but the book contains no explanations, it only directs you what you can and cannot eat and loads you with a lot of very good recipes that are compliant with the diet. I think this book makes a good cornerpiece to your list of candida book resources but you're still going to need another book that discusses the wholistic implications of candida on your body and ways to treat it outside of strictly diet. For example, the concept of probiotics like Threelac or saccharomyces boulardii are not even mentioned here."
5,153445.,"I disagree with the review below only in that Xuvetyn is ""less choppy"" than Bloweyelashwish. I guess that makes sense in a way, but my primary qualm with Xuvetyn is it's irritatingly abrasive progression as an album. Xuvetyn, like Bloweyelashwish, has many short tracks interspersed with longer ones, but where as it worked nicely on the first album, here it's just sort of jarring, and additionally some of the shorter tracks strike me as very similar. BUT, other than that, this is still a wonderful album, surreal, noisy-pretty, dreamlike, and all the things that Bloweyelashwish was. For the aforementioned reasons I think I like Bloweyelashwish a little bit better, but both albums are very nice."
2,colander,I really liked this when I bought it but after 6 months of weekly use the paint began to flake off the bottom and rust started bubbling up. Now just over a year later all the paint is gone from the bottom and some of the sides and it is heavily rusted. I will soon have to toss it and get a new colander.
1,Too expensive in Amazon,"I ordered from here. Later I found the same size and product sold at Walmart for $3.77. Amazon has been very competitive in price for most of everything. This item is more than 85% more than Walmart or grocery store. I thought when I ordered from Amazon, this must be two boxes. It turnout to be one box with 20 tablets."
4,No burns!,"Very good protection. It is more oily than the Australian Gold sheer coverage however it stills goes in very well. Only one negative...do not put it on your face as it will burn, burn, burn. Did I mention it burns on your face? Other than that it works well."
5,GREAT CLASSIC MOVIE!!,THIS GREAT CLASSIC 1934 MOVIE STARRING LORETTA YOUNG AND CARY GRANT IS ABOUT AN EVIL UNWED MOTHER.IT'S A MUST SEE!!
1,They should have kept this one on the vault shelf.....,"Someone should educate 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment about classic movies. Just because a movie is old, doesn't make it a classic, and certainly doesn't justify a DVD release.Fox is sitting on hundreds of great unreleased films, while they end up releasing junk like BORN TO BE BAD. A more accurate title would be FILMED TO BE BAD. Dull and boring (in a poor transfer), this is a waste of time and money."
2,"Happy at first, but not over time","This thing was great for awhile. Great tare feature, resets to zero, very compact (which is what I needed). Now, after about 6 months, it's all screwy. Tried new batteries, tried opening it up and examining interior--nothing. Whenever I put something on it over 23 grams or so I get an Error or goblety-good message. Can't things be made with any quality anymore?"
4,Enjoyable read,"I really couldn't put this book down, and read it in a matter of hours. The story is a nonfiction account of Rebecca Eckler's pregnancy. Rebecca is a newspaper columnist for the Canada Post, and she has a way of making the most mundane events hilarious.The plot follows Rebecca's life from the moment of her conception, to her long-distance relationship with her fiance (a corporate lawyer in Calgary), to her growing friendship with Cute Single Man, who lives in Toronto near her.This book was so funny and well-written, it made me wish she had written other books for me to read."
2,"Written okay, story was infuriating...","I bought this book after reading the first couple of pages thinking ""oh, a good story about how a child changes someone's life for the positive"". Whatever!! I am trying to conceive and I was looking for a feel good funny book about being pregnant--this is not it. This woman is so selfish and I cannot stand it. Throughout the whole book it was all about vanity instead of the joy of welcoming a new life into the world. If you are that kind of person, then this is your book. It is not a good book for those of us who view pregnancy and parenting as a gift and a privelage."
5,Inviting!,This delightful book contains wonderful recipes and desciptive comments about the events and attractions in the area. After reading the book I am looking forward to visiting Mendocino and the Joshua Grindle Inn.
1,Mediocrity or Cacophony...You choose,"I have a decent collection of ""fusion"" music. This CD would probably rate among the worst. The songs swing between either mediocrity or cacophony, despite the presence of some famous names such as Craig Pruess (I *love* his WELCOME HOME). There is very little substance or melody in the songs. All I keep hearing is a steady drum beat. Monotonous and boring. Listen to the samples before you buy..."
4,Another good story,"""Forests of Silence"" was good enough to read more, and I am glad I did. There was enough good and evil battles, and those that had suffered from the evil that has befallen the land of Deltora were freed. So many in this book, that it boggled the mind how strong a hold the evil forces had in Deltora, and how strong only part of the magical Belt of Deltora can be."
4,EXCELLENT PRODUCT,It is not perfect but it works fine. The price is reasonable compared with similar products that are not as good. A note of caution; this products do not have the same effects on everybody hair. Try it.
2,Still a growing musician,"After listening to Robert Rich or Steve Roach this musician is not really very exciting. The music is fair, but not really very exciting or memorable."
2,Nothing I liked dispite being linked through Pandora...,So much for Pandora. I linked to this album from a track I liked and was disappointed upon reciept of the CD to find that the track wasn't even on the CD! Arrggh!!! Not my idea of cool stuff this fellow produced but I'm sure someone somewhere likes it... It's back up for sale on Amazon...
3,An OK reference book,"I use a few books as reference books during my ratio analysis of a companies position, and this one is just a backup. It's got tons of formulas, but most of the ones included in THIS book, you NEVER need to use in an analysis of financial statements.The book seriously lacks explanations of what the ratios and formulas mean. It just vaguely states at the end of each formula who might use it and why, but doesn't go into the detail you'd want. The book just doesn't sit right. If you want a good reference book for ratio analysis of financial statements, than get ""Business Ratios and Formulas: A Comprehensive Guide"" By Steven M. Bragg"
2,Disappointing,"I bought this book with great expectations. What a great idea..a book you can get wet and read while you are relaxing in water. That one feature is the only reason I am rating it 2 stars, otherwise it would have got 1. I was expecting to read some sexy erotic stories and what I got was a lot of homosexual fantasies. This book is very misleading. It should have given some indication in it's review that it has many homosexual stories in it. I was expecting to be pleasantly arroused and instead I was very let down, actually totally disgusted. Only buy this book if you are gay."
2,Drown this book!,"What a great idea! A book made of plastic that can be read in the bathtub! I couldn't resist the idea! But then I got home, stepped into a soothing bath and felt sick. The writing was soooo bad. Even erotica should have a plot line and some connection between the reader and the characters. These stories had none and I did skip from one to the other hoping to find one or two that would call to me. No luck."
1,Disappointed,"The idea of reading a book in the bath is pretty cool, but I was looking for more. The stories were boring. There was just too much hype and I don't think it's worth the money."
1,A disappointment and not worth the effort,"Yes, hard to read, and not worth it when you do! Sort of dull, long, mediocre stories, not real bad, but not very good. A disappointment after the long wait."
2,The Pain Lingers,"Even after you've turned it off, ripped it from your CD player, and played frisbee with it with your dog."
2,A tedious read,"This brings a lot of new-age mysticism to rock climbing. There are definitely some valuable insights but you have to wade through a bunch of tired prose to find them. Overall, it won't do as much for your climbing as spending that time climbing."
2,great!,The book was in great shape. The book was as described. thanks for selling a good product like this one. I really appreciate it!
2,Takes great pictures but beware!!!!!,I loved this camera It took great pictures was easy to use and with the dock a sinch to charge the view screen even worked pretty well when it was sunny....I would have given this camera a 5 before I started having problems with it ...first the view screen stopped working but I could still take pictures..then it would only boot up some times...and now it won't turn on at all...actually I take that back the ready light continously blinks red......I have read many other review that have the same problems with this camera....a word to the wise DON'T BUY THIS CAMERA...you're just asking for it!!
2,didn't work,I bought this for my kid. Unfortunately the memory stick doesn't record any pictures. It was a waste of my money. Can't tell you how the quality is. Would not recommend to buy used cameras.
2,Poor indoor results,I have a 3 year old 2MP DX280 that takes much better photos. Indoor shots are dark and blurring is a problem with the DX4530.
2,great game but cheap quality,"I love this game but I did not expect the quality to be so bad. Very light plastic, not durable."
4,Cool Product/Toy,"I enjoy playing this game, my wife loves it. You do need to know that it is plastic and that it is sort of entry level quality. This game is a lot of fun."
5,Great game!,We love this game. We had it before but it got lost in our move. So I was glad to purchase it again. It's so easy to learn and very addictive.
5,Challenging and Fun!,If you like tic-tac-toe type games - this is the ultimate. With the game board changing with each move it is lots of fun right to the end!
4,excellent game! quality sub-par,I used to play this game with my sister for hours when we were kids. I bought it for my nieces who also enjoyed it. The quality of the item itself is not what it used to be- it is rather flimsy.
1,Very Dissapointed,They discontinued the older version of komenuka spf that was in the yellow bottle so I gave this one a try expecting the same results.Firstly I spent 70 dollars to have it sent to my house and the bottle is small.You have to apply alot to cover your entire face and it leaves white streaks.It also makes your face feel tight yucky!Dont buy it
1,Skimpy,"These shirts are not 6.1 oz cotton. they are too thin for that. Also, way too small. I ordered 3 xl's and can't wear them. On sale and free shipping so I can't cost justify returning them either!"
1,It's all in Japanese,"I'm a fan of Oriental ghost stories. Their culture, especially Japan, breathed new life into the genre,especially after the American remake of The Ring. I couldn't follow the plot of this movie as there were no English translations. I have run into several movies that I was unable to watch due to no English captions on Amazon. Very frustrating..."
3,Fell a little short,"Then She Found Me was a good summer read - light and humorous at times. The main character is a frumpy high school Latin teacher who was adopted at a young age. Her birth mother, quirky talk show host Bernice G!, is trying to develop a mother-daughter relationship.I found the book, mainly Bernice's disorganized and quirky behaviors, to be entertaining and humorous. The characters were well developed and realistic. However, the plot itself seemed slightly disorganized. It's been made into a movie and I tried to picture Helen Hunt and Bette Midler as the characters...couldn't do it. I will be interested to see the movie.I would recommend Then She Found Me as a quick, lighthearted beach read. But borrow it from someone, or the library."
4,Quirky but endearing characters make for an appealing read,"April, a lonely teacher with a quiet life, grew up happily in an adoptive family. Shortly after the deaths of her beloved adoptive parents, however, she is contacted by Bernice, a flashy talk show host who claims to be her ""real"" mother. April is not the type of daughter Bernice expected to find, and Bernice is not exactly the birth mother about whom April dreamed for years. Their reunion is frequently funny, sometimes stormy, but ultimately heartwarming; when set against the backdrop of April's budding romance, it makes for a novel which is both humorous and touching. Lipman fans will not be disappointed, and those new to the author may very well go on to read some of her other works as I did."
5,I had almost no experience with *nix,"Even though I was still very new to Linux/UNIX, this book was able to help me create a fully automated backup routine as well as how to restore from those backups. I found the book very easy to read and not at all dry."
3,Fishnet stockings,Sexy with a satin bow but they have a tendency to roll down your leg and not stay put in one place.
1,BROKEN,"I purchased the PD-1000 in April. It will not turn on, will not reset, it won't respond to any buttons."
1,Horrible piece,"Be very very careful while buying this equipment. Use it as much as possible during the first month, because, chances are, you'll have a bad piece.Our player just froze up for no reason (wasn't jogging or anything) often.I wouldn't recommend it. For a few bucks higher, go for a known brand."
2,"Great player, if you're lucky...","This player could be the best deal you can get right now on an mp3 player; priced at $70 if you include the mail-in rebate. It has a good amount of space for the price, and all the functions of it work well, the size is good, though I might have liked it to have some bundled software instead of having to use drag and drop. Also, it can be annoying to tag everything with ID3 2.3 or higher, but tags can easily be converted with many programs. However, this unit has been known to freeze from time to time, and one of the times it froze for me (3 days after I got it) it began to make a buzzing noise even after i reset it, [...] Some people didn't have this problem, so if you're willing to take the chance that mine was an isolated incident, this is a really good player to buy."
2,"Cute Presentation, but prose? Really?","If you're going for appearance, you might enjoy this version of Homer's Odyssey. However, if you're looking for a verse translation or value fidelity to the original work at all, this is probably not your first choice. Like many classics, the modern variation has been altered for easier consumption. This isn't always a good thing.I personally would suggest Lattimore's translation. There's a copy out which is equally pretty, but remarkably true to its source. It was first recommended to me by a Classics Professor at UC Berkeley."
4,"Love the collection, not so into the interface.","I love all the books I get with this collection. I particular, I use the Bible Background Commentary for OT and NT, and the Dictionary of Biblical Imagery. For fun, I enjoy browsing through Hard Sayings of the Bible. I also own many of these books in printed form, but it's much better to be able to travel with just my laptop and these e-texts!I'm not a big fan of the whole Libronix system though. It just feels a bit clunky, and I have had problems with the installation (keeping track of which books are on my hard drive vs. CD, which ones are unlocked vs. locked, etc) and general use of it (I haven't found a good way to just browse through books). I bet that people who need to make frequent use of the bibliographical information benefit a lot from it, but for me, I just want to have easy access to certain books when I'm doing a Bible study with my church friends. I kind of wish I could just have a giant PDF of each book for my needs."
5,A Hair Raising Good Time,"Sorry for the pun, but when they're that easy I figure it's a command from On High.I've had this thing about a month. Mostly, I agree with prior posts. I like it for hair, beard, and scalp. It's invigorating to give my head a quick massage in the morning, almost like splashing water in my face. The brush looked a little clumsy to me, but grip and control are good (I, also, have large hands).I wanted some stiffness in the brush, but didn't know how much. I'd have to say it's 'bout perfect in that regard, because you can adjust it from painful stab thru smooth glide by changing the angle of attack of your stroke.I have noticed a few bristles on my t-shirt. I don't if that's a concern or normal, but I'll let y'all know if it becomes a problem."
2,It's OK but,This was to replace a brush I lost in a Howard Johnson motel. This brush (made in China) claimed to be boar brestle but I have my doubts as it is very soft. My olst brush after 61 years was still as stiff as when it was first given to me. I guess it is worth the price as I could not find another woden military style brush.
3,Very stiff,"The bristle most certainly do not fall out, the brush is good construction, but the bristles are very stiff. Too stiff for me, I have short hair and a short beard, the bottom line is it is just too stiff. It is rough on the skin and after a few minutes of brushing it starts to feel like you're dragging nails across your skin. I bought a replacement and it was too soft, so I guess it is just a matter of finding one that works for you. Beware, when they say reinforced stiff bristle, they really mean it."
1,Baby Wipes Would Be Better,Small size wipes - very little fragrance and not very moist - Could get baby wipes for less than half the price and they would work better.
3,Poor print quality for the price,For the price of the book I am very surprised how poor the print quality and paper is. The book is only 214 pages long and looks like it was printed from home. We will see how long it lasts.
2,What a Surprize,If I had only known it was a badly spliced together TV show. What's worse? I before I got it in the mail I found ALL the TV shows posted on YouTUBE. Save your money.
1,Pretty Crappy.,This is far from the greatest cd ever. Its got nothin on nothin. It just sucks. It sound so bad. Get into real Rock. Get into a band calld UFO. THey Murder the band on here.
1,Worst movie ever made!,"Laughable and stupid low budget movie filmed on location at, yes, you guessed it beautiful Lake Tenkiller. Nothing wrong with a film having a low budget as some low budget films have worked. This one, however, is one that misfires with some of the most medicore acting I have ever seen. Everything goes wrong in this one so don't bother!"
3,"Not the best, but still not the worst. Inexpensive.","This book showed a lot of promise when I bought it, but after the first few pages it was appearant that this was a book written for European collectors, not American breeders or pet owners. Diet recommendations are possibly harmful, as are some of the training tips. I was hoping for much more from this nicely presented book, but got one collectors opinion and some poor photos. If nothing else is available, this is a start."
3,got it,"Received this the other day. It replaced the original battery that came with my SUA750 which I got approx 1.5 years ago. Not very long lifetime if you ask me. Other surprise was to see that they no longer have a return the old battery back to them via UPS option; the good news is that as of this writing you can supposedly just drop off the old one at any Staples store, so no big deal there. One an a half years... what a joke. Get better longevity with some of the inkjet cartridges I use."
2,Tachikara TX% Extreme,"The ball has a deformity that makes it more oval. I read this previously before I bought it but was swayed by the number of high recommendations. If you plan on using the ball for more than a ""shag"" ball - don't buy it - the quality is not there. I'm using with my 10-yr old daughter so it suits the purpose. Just annoying that when you bounce it on the floor it takes off on an angle."
5,A Beautiful and Moving Soundtrack!,"This is a beautiful soundtrack. I have seen the movie several times and it has become my favorite film. I am a big fan of Leonardo DiCaprio who did a wonderful job in this film. I hesitated to buy the soundtrack, but I am very glad I did. When you listen to the beautiful music it takes you back to scenes in the film and some of the beautiful scenery. You can almost imagine you are in Africa hiking up the mountains in Mozambique with Leo!"
4,Berlitz Greek,"This is a good guide for learning Greek. It has a simple format, and the c.d. shows exactly how to pronounce words. It was easy to use, and can be used for quick reference."
1,They need to update the picture - pre-9/11,"I purchased this puzzle as a Holiday ""lightening special"". . .. and I didn't look closely enough. . . This puzzle is a ""pre-9/11"" photograph, as the ""Twin Towers"" are in the picture. If I had noticed this, I would not have purchased the puzzle. Personally, I just don't want to put a puzzle together and constantly be reminded of such a tragic time in our history."
3,Good for a rainy day and the price,not a bad movie alittle hard to understand what they are saying because they are using a british or english accent. the movie didnt really have much of a budget and no wheres near the budget of fast and furious movies. but the cars and the driving make up for it. i first saw it in a video store but i never heard anything about the movie so it sparked my curiousity. i couldnt find a trailer for it so i just went and bought it at the video store on dvd. i reccomend if you want to see it rent or buy the dvd. the widescreen is a pretty good transfer. the picture is pretty clean but the sound lacks because its a dolbly 2.0 not dolby digital. i couldnt find a place that had the dvd for rentthe video store only had the vhs for rent so i bought the dvd. i paid less...so i got my moneys worth.
1,This movie blows,"I can't even say how lame this movie was. The guy that wrote it, all the cast, the director, and anyone who had anything to do with making this movie should be kicked the face with a golf shoe for making me lose IQ points sitting through it. I just lost more IQ points seeing the cover for my review."
1,Filters were defective!,"We received the replacement filters. They were as advertised, but the HEPA filter gives off a moldy smell. Not worth the savings over ordering it from another retailer!"
2,colors are way darker than indicated on the box,"Got this puzzle for christmas. Looked nice and usually love the quality of the Ravensburger puzzles but I DO NOT LIKE that the colors are so different from the box (as another user noted as well). The orange is duller and less bright, so you just have dark orange and another tone of darker orange and dark dark orange pieces. - which is not fun for sorting or doing the puzzle. I also don't like it that you cannot purchase a puzzle mat for this size puzzle. If they sell puzzles with 5000 pieces, they should also have puzzle mats for this size.I am seriously thinking about sending it back to Ravensburger."
3,Powerstep Original Orthotic,"I was in hopes that the Powerstep Original Orthotic would be the answer to my foot pain. After reading the good reviews, I thought I would give these a try. They definitely have good arch support, maybe a bit too much for me. I do think this is a good quality product, but don't know if it's the answer for me. Maybe I gave up too soon."
2,slow,"I'm not to fond of this and it discouraged me from getting any more Lycia discs. The songs sound to similar to me and i thin Van Portfleets vocals try to hard to be dark and goth like. i like some of the instrumentals and a few other songs but mostly the songs just float into each other. I rarley listen to it and listening to both discs in a row puts me to sleep, quite ok mood music to play in the background though."
3,A Modern Republic Serial,"First and foremost this is not, I repeat NOT, a textbook realistic depiction of our SEALS at work.Not even close.In fact, it's quite unfortunate that this film is part of the US SEALS series, because it seems that many viewers are upset that it isn't a documentary. These people completely miss the point.This is a flat-out Action Flick filmed in an outrageously over-the-top fashion. Everything that happens on screen is gloriously dynamic: characters movements, gestures and even nods are accompanied by whip-crack sound effects. Even a hard stare leaves an aural vapor trail in this movie.The elaborately choreographed battles, stunts, and jaw-dropping body count will please martial arts and action fans in search of a vigorous cheap thrill.This is one of the most enjoyable beer & pretzels movies I've seen this year. And any film in which the villain gets vertically bisected by a katana can't be all bad.Can it?"
1,Save your money,"Horrible, horrible. Unrealistic plot, and the sounds overdubbed are absurd. A guy salutes and there is a sound of a sword whizzing by your head. A guy pulls a gun, and there is a sound of a sword whizzing by your head, etc., etc. Don't see this if you expect a well made action movie. This might appeal to someone under 13, but you'd have to sucker your parent or guardian to take you to see it. Spare them the pain."
2,cool camera.,This is a pretty cool camera for the price. It has a good resolution and a usb connection. And a cool color too. I suggest it for work and play.
2,"Find ""Gateway to the Mysteries"" and forget this one...","The band Eden (one of several bands with that name) drastically changed their sound between their debut _Gateway to the Mysteries_ (now sadly out of print) and _Fire and Rain_ (which also involved several lineup changes with only lead singer and songwriter Sean Bowley left). In their former incarnation they were a powerfully compelling and deeply spiritual gothic neo-pagan band which managed to transcend genre conventions. However on this release they fell victim to those conventions in a major way. Goth cliches come out of the woodwork (""The darkness in me is the darkness in you""? Give me a break!) as they abandoned precisely those elements which made their debut so special. I would pass on this unless you really love your goth laid on thick, and instead try to find their debut-if you can. Or try _Healingbow_ for an example of what kind of band they once were (tho this EP isn't half as good as _Gateway_...).John DiFool"
2,"get ""The Wedding Ceremony Planner"" instead","This book wasn't as helpful as I hoped it would be. I ordered two books to plan my ceremony (the other was ""The Wedding Ceremony Planner"")and I barely opened this book. It is short and doesn't provide enough examples."
3,Instructional Videos uneven in production,"I bought this two DVD set to familiarize myself with the Canon EOS 20 D before starting to use it. In general, the first volume covers the camera's operation and menu system. Each section was narrated by an expert. The level of expertise and the speaking skills of experts varies considerably (as well as the volume of each section). The Canon 20 D operational information is covered, however, the video production leaves a little to be desired. It is difficult to see, in some sections, the camera controls that are being discussed (black on black).The second DVD covers ""taking pictures"", which could apply almost to any camera. The sections are poorly put together and the editing is amateurish. I should have gotten a clue when I noticed that the DVD are blue coated and not pressed and had paper labels.I believe the cost of 48.00 is much too high for this item."
2,Bad Orchestral work...NO expression to be found...,This is one of the most undynamic recording of the Brahms F Major ever put on disc....who ever thought a chamber orchestra could do justice to a piece of music that requires much larger forces...interpretively the ideas are sound...but the players are very unimaginative....no vibrato in the clarinet or flutes...even the oboe seems to be in another dimension..where the hell is the Brahms gutsiness we know and love?Listen to the lack of portamento and even the lack of brass sonority and you begin to wonder who the hack was in the control booth playing with the buttons on the mixing board. The acoustic obviously is not the best....no one takes a chance on making music here.
5,It's never too late!,"It's never too late - meaning you're never too old - for Pooh bear and his friends in the Hundred Acre Wood. If you need an excuse, you can always say you ""had to buy it for the kids!"" Absolutely wonderful!"
5,I've never read anything like it!,This is the beast book I've ever read. The simpelness of this book kept me laughing constantly. It is definatly a book I'll never forget. It is my personal veiw that everyone from ninn to nintey-nine should read this book at least once. If you don't you will never know what you are missing. Pooh may be a bear of very little brain but A.A. Miline must have been a very talented writer.
2,not what I expected,"I bought this book because Amazon recommended it for people who liked the book ""Double Indemnity."" Imagine my surprise when I finished it. No femme fatale, no psychopaths, no evil plots. Very dissapointing. I kept waiting for the character Tigger to off Pooh for some honey but no such luck. A bunch of lame animals who don't kill anyone. Barbara Stanwyck probably turned down the script in about two seconds. Amazon needs to take a good hard look at its customer recommendation algorithms because complete failure."
2,Not what I thought it would be...,"Lycia enjoys a small but devoted following. They employ a style of acoustic guitar and mellow keyboards layered harmonically with the beautiful vocals of Mike and Tara VanPortfleet. The effect is to produce haunting, pensive images and stories reminiscent of Dead Can Dance, or some of Pink Floyd's early acoustic work. However, what I couldn't get past was the total lack of percussion in their work. This is quiet, brooding music, but it barely seems to move at times. The advice I would give a 1st time shopper for their titles? Listen carefully before you buy. Lycia is like a ghost ship that never leaves the port."
2,Not a masculine pendant,"I based my decision to buy on the only review available. The female purchaser described this pendant as being masculine, and suitable for her husband. I'm a six-foot, two-inch heavyweight, and found the pendant too small for my large frame. The short, delicate chain did not even come close to reaching around my 21-inch neck. IMHO, it's more suited to a woman. Instead of returning it, I gave the pendant to my wife. It looks very nice on her slender frame, and she really likes it. (PS - the reverse side is smooth, showing only sand-like casting marks, and the number ""925"")"
1,The 2nd Worst Holmes Effort I Have Ever Seen,"I knew little of this offering, but am such a Holmes freak I had to order it. Frewer is absolutely awful, and certainly responsible for making these four movies unbearable.These films are only slightly better than Christopher Lee's German production of ""Sherlock Holmes and the Deadly Necklace"".Don't be tempted by the low price. This set is not worth the price of postage. Save your money for the MPI Rathbone series."
4,a collection of quality family fun,"My nine year old nephew loves this collection of Holmes mysteries. These episodes are mysterious, funny, action packed, and down right creepy at times. These adventures don't always follow Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's stories, but as family oriented versions they are very good. Kids who are interested in Sherlock Holmes, and those who are still kids at heart, should enjoy this collection. I adore it."
4,DIFFERENT BUT ENJOYABLE,"Having grown used to Sherlock Holmes as either Basil Rathbone or Jeremy Britt (and in my opinion they are both EXCELLENT), at first I did not like Matt Frewer's interpretation of Sherlock Holmes. But as I watched each additional film I grew to enjoy his portrayal. Although I have seen each of these four movies before, there was a different twist to each story and made it almost like a new Sherlock Holmes adventure.If you love Sherlock Holmes mysteries and are looking for a different angle to some of the most well known stories of this mastermind of detectives, then I think you will like it too."
3,Shrink your Female Fat Zones,Program goes pretty fast. It is hard to learn without stopping the program numerous times.
5,Great Toning Video,"I LOVE this workout - there are two complete 20 minute workouts which easily combine into one great workout. Two dumbells (for first 20 minute workout) and an exercise ball (for second workout) are needed. Although this workout is about toning (not cardio), it still gets my blood pumping. And Denise is really good about telling you what each exercise will help you achieve (i.e., toned upper back, flatter lower belly). Again, GREAT video!"
2,Not happy,"The Amazon page did NOT mention an exercise ball. The package said one was ""recommended."" About 15 minutes of 20 minute program required ball. I don't have a ball and did not want to buy one. I would return the DVD except I opened it."
5,Outstanding Workout for 50 year old!,"I turned 50 this year and my main exercise is walking. My doctor insisted that I begin weight bearing exercises and do more back strengthening workouts. This DVD is absolutely the most fabulous workout I can imagine. Perfect for any age, it's geared to young and middle age women, I think. I can adjust the weights to suit my strength. At 50 I feel like I am in better shape now than 10 years ago. By doing this routine in the morning, my energy level and metabolism stays in great shape for the whole day. Very convenient 40 minute length. Total body workout. Denise is awesome!!"
3,"Great workout, DVD needs a tweek","I enjoy both workouts on this DVD. However, when you open the DVD its divided by chapter, not by workout. So, you can either start with the first chapter and stop after 20 minutes or start with chapter 4 (when they start with the balance ball) and go on from there. I prefer Denise's other newer DVD's that divide the workouts, not the chapters. Otherwise, these are 2 great workouts. They can be done together, but a lot of the moves are repeated in the second segment, just a touch different.I love these workout, my reason for the 3 stars is purely based on the division of chapters instead of workouts."
3,Good for a beginner,This video is great for a beginner but it doesn't keep someone who regularly works out very interested.
5,Great Workout,"This workout will get you reslts. I did it for about a month and was completely toned. I wasnt that out of shape to begin with but it certainly worked its magic quickly. I would say its a bit difficult to get through... what I like is that even after youve done it for a month its still somewhat of a challenge to finish. The areas worked are exactly where women need it, you wont be disapointed. I dont mind her personally either. Its a bit much but when your doing a difficult workout it can be a welcome boost."
3,Good for Beginners,"I was disappointed when I bought this tape. I'm an avid exercise nut and I loved Denise's Ultimate Fat Burner. I guess I expected something similiar because of the title. This would be a great workout for someone just getting into workouts as she has some good exercises here, just doesn't do enough of them to do anything for those who are more advanced. I used heavier weights to get a little more from it but this is one video that is only used when I'm not feeling terrific or when I first start working out in the fall(I run in the warmer months and save the videos for winter). Some of the ball exercises are fun and even a little challenging, you just don't do enough repetitions."
1,SILLY,"Nothing much here. Just photographs and 95 pages. Sitck with ""FROM ZERO TO HERO"", from Alan Henry. Even if it was written before Hill won the tittle in 1996, it has some substance..."
4,Why no CD reissue?,"I have had this album on LP since it first came out, whenever that was. I have been looking to find it on CD, but apparently no one with the rights to it feels it deserves a rerelease. I do have a newer recording by two other pianists, but to me, it's not as brilliant as the original...and it doesn't have that Carmen McRae vocal version of the theme (""There'll Be No Tomorrow""). Please, Columbia...put this on CD!"
3,The Chateau - Romancing France,"I loved the flavor of this book; hard to find authors who seem authentic about this period of time; just post WWII. Reminded me of another French travel book Clementine in the Kitchen; which was about a less sad time in this wonderful country.The main characters aren't extremely interesting, but one wants to get to know the author better; it is as if a friend is telling you the story of these ""babes in the woods"" Americans. I think I liked Harold and Barbara Rhodes best on their first trip in spite of themselves. They were too sophisticated the second time to be sympathetic characters.Good read, don't look for much action."
4,Just about perfect!,"We recently got a new puppy and this gate has been almost perfect. We bought this gate to keep our puppy in the kitchen. On one side we have a fireplace and the other side we have a wall that is on an angle. So, we were unable to buy a wall mounted gate, because we couldn't drill into the fireplace on the one side and we were unable to get a pressure mounted gate because the slanted wall would not 'hold' the gate. It has turned out to work out very well for us, because we can move it around and block off other areas in the house. Like some other reviewers have said, though, it would've been nice to have a door within it, because it is a pain to adjust. Also, storing it, when not in use, is kind of a pain, because it is very large. This has kept my new BT out of unwanted areas, but I fear that she is getting very close to being able to jump over this gate soon. I hope we can manage to keep that at bay for a while."
3,"Beautiful, but assembly awful","This is a beautiful freestanding gate. We bought 2 of them. They go well with our hardwood floors. However, the assembly didn't make sense - the bolts provided were not long enough, and there were only holes on one side of the wood. Even if it had worked, you would have to unbolt it in order to adjust the length. We were able to use the gates despite the adjustment bolt not being used. It works great for our small puppy, which is why we got it. However, our older dog, which is a medium large dog (about 60 lbs) has no trouble at all pushing it aside if he wants out."
5,"Excellent for baby-proofing, too!","After looking at many different products, I purchased this gate to prevent our toddler from getting into the fireplace. It's the perfect solution for our needs!Things I like about it:* Adjustable size -- allowed us to fit it perfectly around the fireplace* Stable -- the legs are sturdy and large enough so it won't tip over, even when the baby pulls herself up on it* Freestanding -- didn't require us to drill holes to secure it to the wall* Good looking -- the wood frame and black bars blend into our decor (not an eyesore like those white baby-proofing fences)* Ease-of-use -- installed in minutes, and easily folded to store when not needed"
5,EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR!!!!!!,"This Gate is incredible!!!! It's more than I had hoped it would be!! Thanks to ""Customer Comments"" I was able to pick out this beauty. It's solid, it's beautiful, and the little gates that open, close, and even lock are really neat. Like I said, more than I even dreamed of. Worth every penny, and easy as stuff to put together. My little Scottie girl doesn't know what to think. Thank you so very verymuch!!!! Julia Crawford---Oh, one down side,:-(, it is heavy. A little person like my Mother wouldn't be able to move it. That's one reason the little gates on the side are so nice. BUT, that is the ONLY down side I can find with it."
2,Not very helpful,"I bought this book after my first semester, hoping it would be some help. It was pretty much stuff I already knew. It might be helpful for someone who has never briefed a case before, but if you've been in class a week or more, this book probably won't be very useful. The rest can be summed up by: do your homework."
1,obviously,"There was nothing in this book that wasn't obvious. I'm almost halfway through my first year of law school, and I have to say this book doesn't help at all. If you want a good overview of law school, try Law School Confidential instead. Both books have general information, but LSC is at least more realistic in planning how to study and approach classes."
1,Disappointing,"Anne Perry should go back to the Victorian novels which she does so well. Tathea, which I did not finish reading, is dull unless you are interested in descriptions of a fantasy land. Ursula le Guin, Sherry Stepper, and the author of the Dune series have already covered this territory in a much more intereesting manner. Perry's social descriptions of Victorian life in her other novels are so compelling that it is hard to see why she has taken off in this new direction."
1,Thinly veiled Christian apologetic,"A rather tedious book that effectively takes traditional (1900's) Christianity to another ""world"". Only vaguely readable, and not really worth the money. I would not even classify this as fantasy per se; it should have been characterized as christian fiction. Unfortunately, this genre is rather predictable, and the resulting story line is rather dull."
1,What a dissapointment... Not the usual Anne Perry's book,"Even though I knew it would be a totally different book from the ones she usually writes I was very disspointed. I read all of her books in the ""Pitt"" and ""Monk"" series. She is my favorite author. But this time I did not even finish the book. At first, it seemed like it was going to be interesting, but then after about 80 pages or so, it became so boring that I finally stopped reading it. Even from a Mormon's point of view, this book is weird, and boring.BUT, I would like to tell people who said that it was their first ""Anne Perry"" book and were dissapointed to the point of not wanting to read any other book of hers, PLEASE, READ HER ""PITT"" AND ""MONK"" SERIES. You will not be dissapointed."
1,Bored Now...,"Preachy, meandering, and hard to follow are the descriptions that I would use to describe ""Tathea"". Some parts were interesting, but they kept being interrupted with long philosophical treatises on the Bible...er... ""Book"". I was hoping for something along the lines of Guy Gavriel Kay. Boy, was I wrong."
1,Very misleading,"I am a big fan of Anne Perry and have read all of her mystery books. All of her books have been well researched and show Victorian England in gritty reality. For that reason I expected something of the same to be true of this book and was very badly disappointed.Readers were mislead for the beginning in being told that this is a fantasy book. This isn't fantasy, it's a spititual journey espousing one religion's teachings. If I had been told that this entire 500+ page book was a metaphor for the Morman religious teachings I would have saved my money. Even without the religious theme the story is boring and the characters are two demensional. Books today are too expensive to waste money on and readers should be given a true idea of what they are getting."
5,Love this movie!,I saw this movie on TV when I was a kid and loved it - as I grew up I would see on TV periodically and still loved it - Now as an adult I still tune in when it's on TV - got it on video and see it whenever I want to - It is Cary Grant at his most handsome - A very sweet love story and covers the range of love/friendship on many levels - Really cool movie -
5,An original plot and some great lines! Fantastic film!,"""People Will Talk"" was a great movie that had everything that a classic movie lover wants. There were some great lines and characters, and throughout the whole movie, it kept me wondering exactly who Dr. Pretorius and his sidekick really were. Highly recommended."
2,"""BRILLIANT COMEDY""? HA!","On the back of this DVD is a review from the ASHVILLE MOUNTAIN XPRESS which includes the words 'BRILLIANT COMEDY'. All I can say is the reviewer must have been watching a different movie. If you are expecting a laugh-riot, you will be VERY disappointed. I would have been happy with a handful of chuckles, or even a warm smile or two.And while I have seen far worse Cary Grant movies (see, or rather DON'T see, THE AMAZING ADVENTURE) this one was rather strange."
1,Don't Bother,"I love Cary Grant and Jean Crane, but this movie does neither one justice. The ""sinister"" undercurrent takes away any attempt at humor. Plus, there is no spark between Cary and Jean either. Forget this waste of time and stick to comedies or Hitchcocks."
4,Good,"The ""reader"" portion of the lens is large and very easy for your eye to catch. However, they are attached on either side of the lens so they are easily noticed by other people. If you're looking for discreet readers in your sunglasses you might want to think twice."
3,reader sunglasses,Product works but stickon bifocal looks and feels funky. Probably as good as you're going to get for the money.
3,sun glasses,The service from the supplier was good. The bifocals on the glasses would be better if they were set lower.
2,delicate ear pieces,tried them briefly felt comfortable good clarity & magnification in the correct spot the only thing is while folded in bag that comes with these inside jacket packet earpiece broke off.
3,requirement sampled,"this book was recommended to me because a friend intimated concern. i could read in between the links over a public online forum that her advice has taken the form of some categorized theory. question is, can scholars unclog my process of getting caught up in the act of taking? what seems to be a present risk to the medium is a lot of taking by consumers. writing about taking without actually taking is the self-diagnosed solution thus far. there is a lot going on now, with the revolution, to confuse any owner of a camera. she also recommended i look into ethics of photography, the psychology of photography and the history of advertising that also uses photography and finally the laws about who or what to photograph in public with or without permission. she gave me the definition of voyeurism as well."
5,"Funky, jazzy, proggy.",The Greatest Show on Earth had everything. What a great band! I love the horns and the drummer.[DW]
3,I agree on not having bypass surgery but is Chelation therapy the answer?,I still had my doubts about the safety and use of Chelation therapy as an alternative to curing heart problems related to blockages. I was not convinced and the book did little to educate me a tyo why i could trust the procedures.I have heard of great results by people who have gone this route - and I do not doubt that people have gotten better - but I am not sure that is was because of the use of this therapy.I think bypass surgery is brutal and hurts rathers than cures or heals. I am just not yet inn agreement with this book - but I could be wrong and it may be wonderful - I just have my doubts.
1,Another Flat Mix from Subliminal.....,"This is yet another flat mix from Subliminal. Once responsible for some of the best mixes on the market, Subliminal mixes of late have been fairly flat and uninteresting. Both mixes start out with overly long uninteresting songs that almost make you want to give up on the mix entirely by the time track two finally arrives. Further listening only reveals more of the same. There is very little warmth throughout any of the tracks and not one song stands out. Even the remixes are uninteresting - Robbie Rivera's Sex 2005 is missing all the original hooks rendering it limp and lifeless, and not at all reminiscent of the original. Looking back, out of all the eight Subliminal Sessions mixes only maybe three are worth owning, this one unfortunately is not one of those mixes. I say don't fall for it again (or at least this time) - with so many dud's to so few truly great mixes, Subliminal is no longer a brand to be counted on."
4,"Wario 12"" Plush",The young person I acquired for loves it and plays with it regularly. It arrived in the time frame specified. Is what expected.
2,Great Concept - Poor Execution,"I ordered this bluetooth headset for my Blackberry 8700C.PROS: Great display; redial history and control buttons mean that you can use this headset to make and receive calls without checking the cell phone.CONS: Everything else. Poor connectivity; lots of static on the listening end; choppy reception; HEAVILY prone to wind noise; people on the receiving end stated that they could not hear me clearly, if at all.BOTTOM LINE: Great concept; poor execution. I would have LOVED to keep this headset for its features, but if it cannot properly function as a bluetooth headset, looks like I'm going to have to get a ""plain jane"" non-led display model.Gave the item 2 instead of 1 star due to the features. Perhaps this headset will work better with other phones."
5,works great,"I had bought an old saddle from a friend of mine that looked pretty bad. I bought leather new and applied it and it made the saddle look a lot better!! I now use this on my boots and reins to spruce them up any time they're looking a little sad. I'm impressed with this product and will definately use it again, and again!!!!"
2,****Warning for onboard sound!!!!! No Support - Product seems good,"I ordered this product, it came in good time. Had previous TVTuner and had issues getting this one to work. After finally getting a hold of the manufacturer, they were able to get me set up. Only problem is I have a nVidia nForce 2 with onboard sound. There is a crackle in the sound once installed. They told me they have issues with onboard sound but couldn't figure out a fix. Sent back to manufacturer to have them look at the unit. They are slow to respond and you have to keep following up with them to find out what's going on. Also had to pay for shipping back to KWorld. Still waiting for a resolution, as they still have the unit."
4,Okay Book,The Book was okay but confusing for the lay person in some areas. Not exactly what I expected. It did arrive on time and in good condition.
4,Excellent,"Miles better than Microsoft's turgid ""Step by Step."" The flippant asides are unnecessary, for my taste, but Lowe writes clear, direct prose, and anticipates the standard questions and difficulties. I learned more in one hour with this than in three with Microsoft's doorstop of a manual."
1,Half Full!,I bought two of the beige Airbrushed when Amazon had them for $15 each for a limited time. I had to wait for the stock to come in and when they finally shipped they were only half full. No wonder they were for $15 special price. Nothing was noted on the descripton saying they would be a lesser amount of product. I will be very careful next time to look at my purchases when they come in. I did not open until this week to use and I received in January so could not return. Product is exceptional as usual but what is with the decreased quantity? Disappointed to say the least.
4,Nice Product!,"I have been using this makeup for approximately 3 years and I continue ordering it time and time again. The product provides a medium level of coverage. If your skin is irritated, this product may not provide enough coverage, but for someone with clear skin, it will do the trick without making you look overly done up. Each jar lasts me approximately 8 months with regular daily use and I also purchase the applicators for cleanliness purposes. My only issue with the product is that the color swatches online are not always accurate and I have a few cannisters that don't match my skin. So I recommend reviewing the color on various websites prior to purchase. I am typically the lightest color in each brand and I use the natural color."
2,Philosophy Supernatural Airbrushed Canvas Powder,Unfortunetly..this product did not meet my expectations...very little cover-up and hard to get the powder out on brush. Would not purchase again.
4,Philosophy,"I have used a mineral based powder makeup for years and a friend suggested I try Philosophy. I was not really in the market for a new brand but decided to try it. I wasn't too sure about the applicator as I normally clean my brushes often and this pad is hard to clean plus I feel like it wastes a lot of the makeup when you wash it. I suggest using a brush to apply and the pad on areas where you want a little more coverage. The powder itself is nice. It goes on smooth, covers fairly well, minimizes my pores and it lasts all day. Overall I like the makeup with the exception of the applicator and the cost."
5,My favorite all-in-one make-up!,"This product does a better job than my combination of using a concealer, a foundation, and a correcting powder. It goes on in seconds instead of minutes, and it leaves a flawless look. I have very oily skin, and I have always fought with it all day. Not anymore! I have a red tone on several spots of my face, and this powder completely conceals that for hours. Around mid-day I use blotting papers to remove excess oil, and I reapply the powder just a touch in trouble areas. For less oily skin, I would guess that you wouldn't need to reapply at all during the day."
3,Cakey,"I love Philosophy. I use the Miracle Worker line and The Present. I decided to give this a try. I received it in the afternoon and immediately wanted to try it. When I put it on around my nose, every pore filled with the makeup and it was very obvious. It did not blend well at all around my nose.So I tried it this morning, fresh moisturizer, primer..same result. If I wasn't running so late, I would have washed my face and applied my regular foundations. I am returning this.I have other powder foundations, Bare Escentials, and that works fine, so I am not sure why this one did not."
5,Charger,Best batteries on the market do require an 8 cell pro recharger! It's a great charger and I actually own several.
3,Didn't work with my Tenergy Batteries,"For some reason this didn't work with the Tenergy rechargeable batteries, so I had to return it. But it seems like it would be fantastic if it works with whatever brand rechargeables you have. I think it is really a symptom of the Tenergy batteries and not this. They seems to have a millimeter more plastic that wraps them than some of the other rechargeable batteries I have."
2,I would NOT buy another one...,"This is a tough one... because on one hand, if you are using rechargeable batteries, this does slam a full charge to them in an hour. If you are trying to recharge conventional batteries, this thing sucks and will over charge (and cause leakage). All that is understandable... and though I wished (and thought) it dealt with all types of batteries, that was my mistake.MY PROBLEM WITH THIS is the display... it has the smallest friggin writing I've ever seen! I have 20.20 vision, but had to get a magnifying glass to read the flashing 'Done' - that is too damn small, and flashes really fast. THAT is a really poor design for a product of this nature & cost."
5,Best charger I've owned,"The Maha Powerex MH-C801D 8-cell charger is fast, efficient and its ""soft charge"" capability helps extend the service life of your batteries. It accepts both AA and AAA rechargeable NiMH batteries and can have them fully charged in 1 hour. Each battery is charged and monitored on a separate circuit, independent of the other batteries, ensuring full charging and no overcharging of each. A couple of nits: the green LED pilot light on the AC power adapter is excessively bright (I turn the pack over at night when I'm trying to sleep). The LCD battery monitor display, on the other hand, is rather dim and low-contrast, making it difficult to read in low light. So I use the bright pilot light to illuminate the LCD screen -- viola! I received good, attentive delivery service from Accessory Genie (Amazon's source for the product)."
3,It's Okay... but not what I was looking for.,"It looked better on the site that in person. Most of the info I already knew (I was an art major though) and I was looking to use this for my art class. But I did not find it useful. A more traditional style that I did not like and would not be interesting for my students. Benefit are that I now have an additional book on my bookcase so I can look smarter!I would recommend the Annotated Mona Lisa, I purchased it and liked it better. It was a different style that my middle school students liked better. I am still looking for a art book with out nudity (Mona Lisa have very little, just the David and a few other famous ones). Hard I know, but I need one for my elementary students. Now i just tape pages together."
2,"""Diary Of A Roadie"" is a more appropriate title.","I was hoping to get some insight to Miles' great live band from '73-'75. Instead, we're treated to the author's sexist view of women, his total idolization of Miles and seemingly barely-remembered anecdotes of life with Miles on and off the road. Interspersed are stories of life on the road with David Allen Coe (nope, Miles wasn't playing trumpet in his band), visits with Johnny Cash (ditto), stories of personal drug use and abuse and the bedding of various women. When Murphy calls Orleans (remember those guys? They [stunk]) a ""great band"" it's time to break out the hula hoops. Sorry, but I'm glad I checked it our from the library rather than blowing 17-plus dollars on this poorly-written book."
1,not a heavy duty scrubber,"This item is not a heavy duty scrubbber, if you are looking to do cleaning in the bathroom I would reccomend looking elsewhere"
3,Could have been great,This sponge has the potential to be awesome. My only issue with it is that I cleaned a knife with it when I first got it and the knife blade tore the sponge slightly. I do wish the material were tougher. I have taken great care ever since while washing my knives yet the sponge has now almost completely fallen apart all stemming from that one little tear. I will probably order another soon (because other than the slight delicacy of it it is great) but I am disappointed it didn't last as long as I hoped it would.The best thing about this sponge is that it does not get that disgusting old food smell that regular sponges seem to develop over time. It cleans very well.
3,Jetz-Scrubz Comparable to Scotch Brite Photo,"It's a decent sponge, however I'm not (as of yet) seeing any benefit over the standard Scotch Brite sponges I pick up locally. So it seems (at this time)the the higher cost is not warranted. See photo's I uploaded."
2,Too violent for children,"I purchased this game for my 8 year old grandson. He had read the book and was very interested in having the game, unfortunately it was way too violent and we had to take it away from him. How disappointing."
4,Year of Ritual,"In ""A Year of Ritual: Sabbats & Esbats for Solitaries and Covens"" author Sandra Kynes brings the reader through a year of ritual and ceremony just as the title suggests. As an advanced practitioner I felt a desire for less defined structure and more ideas to incorporate into my magical year. This is a good book for those who need total structure because there is not a lot of wiggle room for inserting your own ideas or beliefs. Sandra Kynes is a fine writer with a very concise, somewhat elfish style that is endearing. At the back of the book there is even a glossary and some pronunciations for elfish words, which is a really nice touch."
3,What happened to the producers?,"It's been mentioned that these recordings could have been remastered a lot better. As Tommy West and Terry Cashman did such a terrific job on his hit albums, I'm sure they could have done a better job here, if indeed they were involved. If they weren't, then why not? It seems that their importance has been left out of recent documentaries and projects. Why is this?"
4,Good overview of 50's material,"If you're looking for a comprehensive set on Pierce's 50's material, go for the Bear Family set. However, for the fan looking for a more basic collection of his singles, this piece offers a good skimming off of many of his top country hits of the entire 50's decade. Although there are several compilations of Pierce's 50's output, this is one of the few that offers ""Bye Bye Love"" (the Everly Bros. cover) - one of only two songs by Pierce that managed to crack the top 100 pop charts.The sound quality overall is good considering some of these tracks go back to the early 50's. The entire disc is in mono with the exception of ""I Ain't Never"" which is in stereo.All told, this CD collection from the U.K.'s Edsel label offers a decent quality compilation of Pierce's 50's output."
2,Pretty boring but pleasant,"I don't know what all the fuss is all about. According to Amazon, this album pretty much does not sell at all. It is ranked no. 112,302 in music, and yet so many people feel the need to express their strong `for' or `against' it. Why so? The album is just as boring, in my opinion. So what if it is called Bach? Simply using snippets of Bach's melodies does not make it Bach and does not make the album classical. The album is pleasant to the ear, nevertheless, and feature a very simple violin line on top of various types of backgrounds. My favorite track is Largo. My least favorite track is The Sicilian, as it sounds pretty dated. BADinerie sounds dated as well, I guess, but mostly, this album is okay for one listen."
4,Good times in Karazhan,"I couldn't figure out what the point of this book was until I was more than two thirds of the way through it, but the good characters kept me with it.Overall, the story is somewhat weak, but it's still an interesting read."
2,Try as I might ...,"... I just could not finish this book .... it is not a lengthy story, but absolutely nothing happens for 95% of the book ... when something does happen, it is over in under a page, and the mystery and intrigue is soft and uninteresting ... this was a waste of money to me, and I have officially quit this series of stories. they went from decent to not worth the paper..."
3,Comprehensive,"May be a lot to absorb if you have no previous experience with Access. If you do, this will work"
1,I don't know.....................,"this is dumb. I have just bought my 11th GCN game and just now is my memory card 59 filld up.i mean how many people realy need 1,000 blocks of memory?? And I would not want to risk all my files,would you? Go with the memory card 59 or better yet,251!!!DO NOT BUY its a watse of $$$$"
1,don't get,I was playing my brand new game then it said my data was crupt and I lost every thing don't buy!
4,To whom it may concern,"This is an overall great prodouct, but, it seems to delete data when trying to hold an EA Sports file like: Madden 2002, All Star Baseball, etc. I recommend that if you only play sports games with ESPN or a year like 2002 in the title, this would not be a good product for you to buy."
1,Ah! Corruption,"Firstly, you can save a maximum of 127 games to a card, not blocks. Of you could only save 127 blocks, the memory card 251wouldn't exist along with some upcoming SD memory card accessories. I thought this was a great card for a while but then it blew. So maybe it is true that I did have a couple save files equal to about 130 blocks and my memory card did feel pretty hot after Bomberman. But no card should die like that!! My recommendation is to go with the Memory card 251 by Nintendo. Nintendo cards are a lot sturdier. I am thankful that the card would just no longer save, rather than deleting my data and I could just move it over"
4,Not a flaw...,"Someone, or some people have been saying that this product will only save 127 blocks due to a Gamecube Design flaw, that could not be more untrue...Being able to save just 127 blocks is NOT a design flaw, it was done on purpose. The Nintendo Gamecube's owner manual will tell you about this..."
1,Do NOT BUY THIS MEMORY CARD,I bought it for All Star Baseball 2003 and it worked great for like 4 days and now I cant SAVE ANYTHING!!!!EVery time I try to save it says there is corrupt data and the season must be deleted...Just a heads up its not worth it...
2,NOT WORTH IT,"I got this memory card because ign.com gave it good reviews, and I wanted a lot of space for saving my games. After using it for 2 or 3 days, my data was corrupted. I believe that data should not get corrupted after a few days, no matter what memory card you're using. I was left highly upset and I regret ever getting this stupid piece of junk. If you're looking for a lot of memory for saving your games, I suggest you get Nintendo's Memory Card 251. I sure wish I did.Although this 16x memory card can save a lot of data, It's useless if it won't load your data every now and then. Right now, I'm using my memory card 59 to save and load data for the games I'm currently playing (Eternal Darkness & Resident Evil) and I'm using this 16x memory card to store the data for my other games.I should've got Nintendo's Memory Card 251 instead. Maybe I'll get one in the near future."
2,"Go to ""Bonus Materials"" and choose ""Director's Cut""","Love Yes. Love Soderbergh. Hate this.In fact, I like all the Yes line-ups, including the Buggles, but not this show. If you go to ""Bonus Materials"" and choose ""Director's Cut"", that eliminates the extremely annoying 50's graphics that fly over the concert footage you'd like to be watching, but there's still the ""Mr. Rabin and His Incredible Back-up Band"" factor (Jon is relagated to back-up singer many times, and doesn't look thrilled about it). Some of the instrumentation and vocals also seem pre-recorded. Mr. Rabin is a great guitar player and singer/song writer, but ""finger-tapping"" in a Yessong? This just isn't a classic Yesshow - it's Yes with Eddie Van Halen.Recommend: ANY OTHER Yes DVD, and ""Jon Anderson - Tour of the Universe"", they're all very good.SolarisYes - YessongsBubbleTour of the UniverseThe Good GermanYes: Live at Montreux 2003"
2,Disappointing...,"I own this Brazilian verion of 9012.Well, all the contents are just the same as on previous release of VHS or LD, but the quality, both in video and in sound, is not even close. It looks/sounds like poorly duplicated bootleg.Now, I just hope the official release of the same thing in US or UK, where any of YES member could check it before release."
3,good dvd...but could have been better,"The concert was a good one. Many Yes fans complain about the era, but I feel there was some good stuff put out at the time. A little more commercial...true...but still OK.The big problem is what they did and did not include in the DVD. I can't stand the video ""enhancements"". Stick with the concert. It's so annoying that I'm tempted to fast forward the sections where they go off on those video tangents.Also, some of the best performances, IMHO, were from the solos record. Totally underrated. Including those solos would have been awesome.So...minus a star for the video crap and minus another star for not including the solos."
1,unsure of authority,"As a translator, I'm always wary of people who take responsibility for translating from one language into another without a firm grounding in both languages. I realize that it's done, but in my personal experience, a lot gets lost unless the person is an absolute master in his or her area of expertise. I bought this book out of curiousity, but it seems to be riding a trend, not contributing much to the field."
3,Disappointed,"The whole reason I bought this book is because Seed to Seed wasn't available on the kindle, and I needed some info on propagating biennials. When I got to the section about biennials, she just says to read Seed to Seed! I wish they had given more details about the book before I bought it, or at least gave me the index."
3,A Somewhat Difficult Recipe Book,"I have the original CS version of this book plus this one and both books are very similar in content.There has been no CS4, CS4 or CS6 editions of this book.If you have later than CS3 versions of Photoshop you may find it difficult to follow as various controls have been re-named or changed.If you persevere with the instructions on how to achieve the effects, the results are quite worthwhile. However the main beef I have with this book is that the author assumes you know where to find the various Photoshop controls and so just says 'go to' ... whereas similar effects books clearly flag the position.Also, as Photoshop has progressed, some of these effects are now rather outdated."
3,Plants that Eat Animals,I wish I had know the reading level of this book. It was way too young for my twelve year old grandson. I donated it to a first grade classroom.
1,Lies Alright !,"Being a Jew I found this book laughable and scary both at the same time,laughable because most religions are based on half truths and lies and each defends their half truths and lies to the bitter end...which is the scary part.I did have some respect for Martin Luther before reading this book,but now I see him as just another religious bigot."
2,eh,"Not crazy about this item. I much prefer the plastic scrapers, and then a brush of some sort.This just didn't 'cut it' with me. Maybe you will like it."
5,National Geographic Topo Maps for Mac,"Excellent graphics with immense coverage. Fairly easy installation on Mac although program installation is not entirely automatic and not exactly intuitive (neither is navigation intuitive within the installed program), but its worth it. Additional map zones automatically join in tandem. Considering the number of printed maps that the Texas Program alone replaces in the 1:24,000 format, purchase is a 'No Brainer'!"
3,Fairness,Does not meet my expectation. Need to have more LED . Stronger magifgier to show the fine print better than it has made now.
2,i don't like it,you have to get too close to an object in order for it to focus.the light is very convenient...
3,Switch to easy to turn on,"This is a neat functional magnifier. The only complaint is that the switch can accidentally get turned on and burn out the bulb. This has happened to 2 of these for us. A design error allows the switch to come on too easily and the bulb only lasts a few hours if it is left on continuously, which of course happens if you are unaware it is on."
3,A Song to Fire You Up,"I'm no hip-hop fan and only like ONE song on here - but that song I LOVE - ""I Believe"" by Yolanda Adams. This song really is motivating and inspiring. ""I believe I can, I believe I will, I believe I know my dreams are real."" Great tune - Great lyrics - Great song!"
3,uhm...,"honey is a really good movie...it cointains really good music and dance steps. unfortunately, it's soundtrack was not as good as the movie...most of the really good songs were not included...-->to those who has the complete copy of all the songs used in this movie, i hope you wouldn't mind sending it to my e mail add which is: s_telmo@yahoo.com"
2,"A good book for definitions, but disappointing in substance",I was disappointed in this book because it provides ten minute definitions and very little practical or useful insite.
2,There are Better Options,"Bought this unit to put USB and audio ports on the front panel of my 2 year old tower case, plus having speed control of the noisy CPU fan would be nice.The good news, audio ports worked fine. The rest is bad, no speed control on my 3 wire fan, and the USB ports only worked as USB 1, even though rear ports are USB 2.0. Geeks.com ignored my request for an RMA, so I'm SOL.What I should have done (in hindsight of course) is simply buy an updated tower case with the front ports and audio already installed. To be honest, it would have been less work and faster to relocate my motherboard and hardware to the new case vs cleanly running and tie wrapping the multitude of wires this thing comes with. Cost would not have been much different for a basic case with front ports."
2,For Nostalianiks Only...,"This low low budget import compilation of sixty songs is a hit and miss affair.It's contents is a mish mash of mono/stereo extracts of mostly live concerts. There are a few rarities included of Sinatra, Martin, and Sammy Davis Jr. live somewhere.(no credits are provided) Seldom do they complete a track as the drunken bantor between them, mostly directed at Sammy cuts the song short. Some will love it! Will this last over time for repeated listening? Many other now faded or fading stars of the Vegas lounge circuit are represented. There's some things by Bing, Tony Bennet, Mel Torme, even some youthful Ray Charles, before he had that unmistakable voice, and early Nat King Cole. The cuts come from various sources and the quality of sound varies from track to track. There are far better sets out there, but this collection gathers a few now obsure stars of the past. Add a star if you have loyal sentiments toward any of them."
5,Back in the Days,"This book took me way back. This book is a photo album for me. It displayed people I grew up with. It caught the innonce within us. It was really nice to see all my friends, though some passed away. The book shows growing up in NY and the fashion trends at the time. This book is a must have if you grew in in Brooklyn!"
3,"Come the Sun, LSD turns to drifting folklore","Less ambient, Love Spirals Donwards return to a more accoustic folklore tracks like Last Classic, Delta, Ipomoea. Sounds more friendlier in Ever, LSD is determined to recreate the childhood moment back. If you are looking for some sad tunes, they won't be found here. Suzanne Perry's voice is more vivid and clear in this album, talking to you like a blossoming flower. Other track like Above the Lone is also worthy of listening. If you are a LSD fan, this one is not to be missed. But if you want to repeat some exhilarating moment, turn to ""Idylls""."
1,The worst Xbox Game .. Ever,"Seriously, this is the worst xbox game I've ever played...it's game based on a gimmick, it's frustrating to play, and I thought using a Lightgun with it would make it more fun...but it doesn't. I have 37 Xbox games, and this one is the only one I regretted buying. Really, this game sucks."
5,"heart warming, wonderful, emotional must buy","Having seen a few clips on youtube and read the reviews here I decided that I would give this film a go and see what it was like. I am from the UK and this was the only place I could find this movie. It's region free in case you need that.The movie just captures from the very beginning with you wanted to know what happens to Nathan, a child forced to prostitute himself out in order to earn money to feed his mother's drug habit.This is such an emotional film that makes you want to keep watching. Branden Nadon is amazing in this film. I have to disagree with some of the reviews that criticise his acting as I thought he was a brilliant actor!!!A must buy movie!!!!"
5,College daughter is happy!,"I purchased the DVD for my daughter who is a college student. She loves the video, and played it on her way back to school after the holidays!"
5,Beyonce Beyonce!!,"I very much enjoyed this DVD. I think its a more intimate look at Beyonce, her career, and personal life. Something she hasn't shared before with the world. :)"
2,Poor quality transfer.,"Unfortunately, it's becoming very difficult to find a decent copy of some of Cagney's older movies. This particular DVD (ISBN: 0-7694-1398-6; UPC: 084296402793) is a poor quality transfer. During the opening, the left and right portions of the scrolling text is cut off so you can't even read it! I'm going to try the Image Entertainment studio release from July 3, 2001. Hopefully that will be a better quality transfer.-dougl"
5,number one baby book!,"this was my daughter's number one favorite baby book. it is a beautiful puffy explore book. well written, sweet and loving. it travels and washes well."
2,BEWARE OF SOUND QUALITY,"Although SG is not QMS's best effort, the title track featuring Nicky Hopkins on piano is a must have. But not on this UK CD put out on the EDSEL label. Although it's a 2000 relase, the sound, in my opinion, is muddy. You'll do far better to buy Capitol's 2002, 24 bit digitally remastered ""Classic Masters"" compilation which has a shining version of the title track, together with Rhino's 1991 two-disc ""Sons of Mecury"" compiation which has an excellent sounding version of ""Edward, The Mad Shirt Grinder"" which, accoring to Rhino, was mastered from the original master tapes. The liner notes by Alan Robinson are, however, excellent."
2,An uninspired record by the class of frisco,"I am a fan Of Quicksilver messenger service but found this album to be mediocre at the best.I picked this one up on vinyl(my whole collection is vinyl) and was dissappointed.Gone was the two guitar attack of Cippolina and Duncan, and gone was the leadership of Gary Duncan.I can say there are only two tracks on this album that stand up to the rest of the groups repetoire.Shady Grove and Joseph's coat.David Frieburg's vocal are still excellent but there are a couple tracks featuring the strained vocals of John Cippolina, an amazing guitarist but very poor vocalist.It is a good thing Gary Duncan returned after this album and brought the pschedelic ranger Dino Valente with him.I would definitely reccomend buying Happy trails or Just for love over this album."
5,delightful,I very much enjoyed reading the book. Wallace weaves a very sensitive potrayal of the players from Yale and Princeton during and after the game. The book has a rather large font. I liked the appendix containing newspaper clippings and excerpts from alumni bulletins.
5,Great buy for any golfer!,"I purchased this net to practice my golf technique. Set up very quickly with included instructions, essentially being two ""tent"" poles that go through plastic sleeves (make sure not to rip the plastic while pushing the poles through). The netting looks like good quality to me. After hitting about 2 or 3 dozen balls with all of my clubs, I am completely satisfied.As a side note, if you are afraid of putting a hole in the net (like some of the previous reviews state), you can buy foam practice balls that feel like real golf balls."
4,JULIE BUDD RECORDINGS,"IN THE MID 1970'S, JULIE BUDD (RECORDING UNDER THE NAME ""JULIE"", ON THE TOM CAT LABEL, CUT A GREAT COVER VERSION OF ' ONE FINE DAY'.( IS IT POSSIBLE TO RECEIVE A COPY OF THAT RECORDING TO ADD TO MY JULIE BUDD COLLECTION?)... PURE IMAGINATION ONCE AGAIN PROVES THE LASTING QUALITIES OVER THE YEARS OF JULIE'S VOICE. SHE 'OWNS' THE SONG, THE SONG DOESN'T OWN HER."
1,Uuuugh !,"Sick. I really didn't enjoy this book. As disgusting as the whole 'kissing cousins' theme was, the worst thing about this book was how boring it was. The main guy's wimpishness was only surpassed by the main girls. The plot was wishy-washy, to say the least. As much as I usually like Charlotte Lamb, I cannot recommend this book."
2,Robert Calvert - 'Revenge' (Blueprint),"Give us Hawkwind fans a break.This disc is WAY over priced.If you still wish to purchase it,do your wallet a favor and buy it used.Four tracks,with a total of twenty minutes.What's wrong with this picture?As for Calvert releases in general,it's okay.Sounds decent,actually liked ""Revenge"".I highly urge anyone to get a copy of the other Calvert CD's FIRST.Aimed at Hawkwind/Calvert completists ONLY and this time I do mean ONLY."
2,Poor,"This game has poor graphics. The storyline, dialog, and voice acting are all very lame. The music is unremarkable. The gameplay, while fast paced, I found mundane.This game is a hybrid of sorts between an adventure game with JRPG cliches and a fighting game such as Street Fighter or King of Fighters. The fighting game aspect is really like a poorly made fighting game, though. It features gameplay from both adventure games and fighting games, but excels at neither. Tales of Legendia has this same problem."
2,"Good content, but confusing","This book is very confusingly put together, and I would not recommend it to a first-time student. Some chapters seem out of order, each chapter usually includes a very difficult end-of-chapter calculational example. The strict Dirac notation is not adhered to. The author throws in some advanced terminology without explaining it. I think it is a great additional resource for teachers or students wanting additional problems or review. Some explanations, however, are wrong--like the explanation of half-integer spin sign change on p. 244 of the 2nd ed. The 3rd ed. is seemingly crippled by references to the publisher's web site, to keep the book ""thin"" (and hence attractive to some eclectic group of quantum mechanics teachers that no one has met). Instead of this gutting, future editions of this book could use a coauthor to make it more reasonable and sensible."
4,Excellent textbook,"Gasiorowicz is a great introductory QM text. Quantum mechanics is ALWAYS difficult at first by its very nature, so those who complain that it is too difficult are probably just stupid or too lazy to actually read the book. The book does a good job on teaching bra-ket formalism and operator methods as well as solving for spin and angular momentum states. The book takes you through all the mathematical steps in a friendly way.I duly recommend for a sophomore/junior level college QM course.The only reason I with-hold the fifth star is because the book could have more interesting exercises and end of chapter problems ( answers to odd numbered problems would be good to)"
5,Sand. LOTS of sand.,"Sand galore. Sand is very much in full force in this fantastic book.After barely retrieving the opal from the City of the Rats, Lief, Barda and Jasmine head to the Shifting Sands. A fun read. Definitly aimed at kids. Great book for any adult to though."
5,HYSTERICALLY FUNNY,"This is the funniest Jonathan Winters CD I have ever heard. He is just as crazy as ever and his mind works so fast and funny, it's amazing. I have given this CD to all of my friends of various ages and they all agree. His bit about being a hotel manager is worth the price of this gut-busting CD."
1,Only if you want the complete set,"If you're expecting the warm and funny Johnathan Winters from,say, ""Mork and Mindy"" or even earlier, don't buy this cd.You will be terribly disappointed. There is allegedly funny stuff on this cd I wouldn't repeat here or in polite company. It has nothing to do with it not being politically correct, it's just disturbing.If you feel the need to have a complete set of Johnathan Winters work, by all means, buy it. But I wouldn't expect you to enjoy it very much."
2,This was a disappointing album,"I truly expected a lot more especially after hearing this group on the So So Def Bass All Stars Volume 1. I really liked their song ""My Boo"" and I was disappointed to not only not find it on this cd, but the overall quality of songs on this cd were not as good as ""My Boo."" The only part of this cd that I did like was the fact that they stick to their roots and keep the bass pumping through the whole cd. I really wouldn't recommend buying this cd though."
1,Rip off,This DVD is 10 minutes long and either shouldn't be for sale or it should only be $5. I am disappointed with Amazon for offering it.
4,baitrunner d4000,"reel arrived in good time packaged well ,a lovely little reel light but strong i havnt used this one yet but will look forward to that in the near future.i have used the older models which are larger and clunkier but for all that they do catch some good fish."
5,A MUST HAVE CD!,"I first heard about Chris Emerson when he opened for Foreigner a month ago. He has the best band I've ever heard. He blew Foreigner away!!! I felt bad for them. I was extremely impressed with his live show, and was compelled to by the CD. It hasn't left my car since. His voice is awesome, it's very powerful and soulful, and his lyrics are very heartfelt. One gets the impression he really believes what he is saying- a very rare quality in todays cookie cutter offerings. Every song on this 13 track disc is just as good as the next. I read he was in the studio for a year making this CD, and it shows! Theres not a bad song on here. The bonus track is the BEST version of ""Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas,"" I've ever heard. He makes it his own! With 3 TOP 40 hits, which have won songwritting contests to boot, you can't loose. This guy should be MORE famous... I don't get it. He blows John Mayer away! Buy it today!!"
4,"No bells,No whistles,No nothing","When i bought this in 1994 it sold for $50 and the problem i have had is this has not died on me yet!!!!!!It has a swing out basket,on/off switch.a basic model with aroma select that really does not do much!Pretty okay for the occasional coffee drinker.I would buy this if you are looking for something very basic,(very unlike today's models),very simple,easy to maintain.This will work well if you want to give your college bound kid something basic for his/her dorm a new one instead of a old one!"
4,"Cyclical, Energetic","A resounding grandeur acompanies the beginning and end of this meditative work. Its ebb and flow of melody excites and eases tension, pulling you along its intricate path, only if you wish to follow. This path is wrought mainly with strings, with little precussion, and some inlfuence of wind/horn instruments.This music is never really obtrusive, and provides a pleasant alternative to silence (to those who value silence), or perhaps as an aid to blocking out other distracting sounds around you. Good for chi work; or simply as a backround wash while working on other projects."
3,Wide area of topics from Lewis,"Different essays about Christianity, including evolution, the efficacy of prayer, and more."
4,Does what it says it'll do: Dual purpose - block UV rays & bugs!!,"Great stuff!! It's very stinky, like the insect repellents of yore, but it's dual purpose is served so well you'll get over it. I'm also happy I can get it on Amazon without having to deal with an Avon lady. No offense to all the Avon ladies out there, keep on...keep on truckin'."
4,Diabetic Friendly Cook Book ......Yummy!,I was very impressed with this cook book. Lots of food choices and they really are REAL foods that taste good. I would highly recommed this cook book for anyone trying to control their diet....what ever the reason. Lots of helpful tips....breaks down calories etc. Very good!
5,Totally Fab!,"What Christmas tradition is complete without Rudolph, Frosty and PeeWee?Stick a little PeeWee into your stocking this season, and you will giggleall year long! Just don't invite him out to a ""movie"" lol...Anyway, itmight be your last chance to see Annette or Charo...So, fire up the DVDand hope that Santa will make PeeWees Christmas wish come true!"
5,grandson loved it,My 4 year old grandson has been waiting to get this dvd for a couple of months. He loves it and it was delived timely and we are all happly with this...Good job Amazon
1,Clash of the Dinosaurs,"Basically a cope of every other one they have made rolled into one. They show 6 animals over, and over, and over, and over, and over, etc, etc, etc,And Dr Themos R. Holtz jr. basically i can not stand to hear his voice!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! A do not buy as far as i am concerned.If they would just let the narrator do the talking it would improved it a lot, and not show the same animals over, and over, and over, etc, etc."
5,Awesome,I bought the car (997) with the flywheel already installed. Awesome throttle response and the car puts down more HP/TQ to the pavement. It feels like HP/TQ to the low end. Very good investment if you want to add quickness to the car.
2,good but buy extended warrantee!,"It's a great phone. It has more bells and whisles than a mortal can use, including an anwering machine in every handset. I have three handsets to go with the base unit, which covers my two-story house nicely. A little over a year since I bought them, one of the hand units began to go beep erratically with the function window flashing and running around the features. The battery was on ""1"" but was not accepting the charge. I switched batteries. The unit did the same crazy song and dance, as if someone was rotating the joystick button. This joystick button seems to be ""stuck"" electronically. Must be the circuit board. There is nothing by way of support on the Panasonic website. So I am about to replace the unit on Amazon. In twnety years of woning panasonic phones, this is the first time, I've had failure. Stuff happens, as Rumsfeld used to say."
5,Great replacement extension,I bought this phone to replace an extension phone that was misplace and never found. This phone is just as great as the the original phone that came with my set. I have not had any problems and the reception is great. I must say this was a great buy in comparison to the prices that I encountered in the store. I save $50 buying this from amazon.
3,Maybe the best of the 3,"Again this is not my favorite series, it has potential but I would have liked to see her create more of a structured and thought out ""fantasy world"". Additionally she ties up loose ends, but in a vague unsatisfying way. I'd buy a second series of the same characters, because I think she has promise... However as I said before you'll likeMagic's Pawn (The Last Herald-Mage Series, Book 1)and the 2 or 3 interrelated series much better than this..."
3,Frequency and Dynamic Range,"If you prefer easy listening music or music with a minimum of high and low pitches and a minimum of loud and soft passages, much like music played in lounges, this album should please you. If you like Beethoven symphonies or Mingus jazz you would probably be happier with these albums: ""Phases of the Moon""(full orchestra), ""Classical Chinese Folk Music"" or even ""Music from the People's Republic""."
4,up date,"I had revived this as 4 star because it does work great. I have long thick black hair. I love it!!! The only reason it is not five stars is for the fact the company had to send me a new one, becaue it was not packaged right. They did infact send me a new one with a pre paid lable also."
2,Meh,"Unless your hair curls very easily vast amounts of mouse/thickening spray before blow drying and lots of hairspray afterwards will be necessary to accomplish any kind of style with this tool. If youre looking for big curls go with a 1 1/2"" barrel iron, but if youre happy with just loose waves get this one."
4,Works great!,"A little larger than I expected, but it works great as a straightener and adds wave. It tames my hair when my natural wave begins to take over. Heats quickly and easy to handle."
2,it didn't work for me!,"it didn't just work for me that's why i returned it about four days after i received it. I really wanted the big curls that's why i got it, but because the curling iron is big, and gets really hot, i could not get the curls i wanted. Hence, i ended up getting burnt. i guess it might be perfect for people with very long hair (mine is in neck). may be in the future i will buy a 1inch curling iron."
1,Badly made piece of junk,The first time I tried to use this tool the spring came off and would not reattach. The screw holding the spring on was defective. What a dissappointment!!
5,"Between a 2"" and 1 1/2""","I was debating between the 1 1/2 inch and the 2 inch. After much deliberation, I ultimately decided on this one. Note: THIS IS NOT FOR FULL-ON CURLING YOUR HAIR. It is for creating large, classy (IMO) waves. I have hair that isn't that hard to curl, but with this, the curls came out faster than normal. They'll usually start to wave after 30 minutes. I used a lot of hair spray, but they still started to unravel. When you first curl your hair with this, yes, for the first five minutes, you'll have fun, bouncy 2 inch curls. However, they probably won't stay like that for very long. So, if you want larger ""curls,"" get a 1 1/2 inch. If you want beautiful waves/some texture to your hair, then buy this curling iron. I absolutely am in love with it. The grip isn't too tight around the hair, and I can still pull strands through very smoothly without touching the spring. This is definitely a brand I would recommend."
3,Not what I expected,When I use this item it doesn't hold my locks. I find that it is not as hot as it claims to be. Although my hair was kind of short. My hair is long now so when I do curl my hair again I will update this review.
2,"Supertool 2""","I'm not real happy with my new purchase, I have used hot tools for years and the quality on this one doesn't seem to compare to the others I've owned. It's not made as good as the others I've owned, Maybe it's an after market who knows. I love Hot tools curling irons they usually last me while but just do not love this one !"
1,NEGATIVE stars,"If I could give negative stars a rating for this product, I would. I received this curling iron as a gift for my birthday and it has never once worked on my hair. The only ""curl"" I achieve is a bent burnt line through my hair. Perhaps my iron is defective, but nonetheless, I am extremely disatisfied with this product and would never recommend it to anyone. I sincerely hope Amazong will look into this and rectify the situation."
1,Don't purchase if you want curly hair,"I purchased the 2"" curling iron for my daughter. The good news is that it arrived very quickly and the price was competitive. The bad news is the 2"" curling iron does not curl hair. I guess it is just tooo big of a diameter and because of that, it only gives a very gentle curl on the very bottom of the hair. It acts more like a hair straightener than a curling iron. I would not recommend purchasing this curling iron.I wish I would have read the other reviews about this curling iron before purchasing it."
3,Not as hot as i thought,"i personally didn't like this 2"" curling iron bc the barrel is too wide... if you have hair length that's half as long as your torso, i wouldn't recommend this product bc your hair wouldn't be long enough to be curled with this. since i have thin hair, this product didn't clamp onto it very well... it kept slipping out of the clamp when i turn it. also, the heat didn't get as hot as fast as i would like it to. maybe if you had really, really long and thick hair, this product would work for you."
3,"Great, but....","I am on my third of these curling irons. Right there that tells you something, right? This iron is perfect for my long, wavy hair, because it gives nice soft curls and smooths frizz. However, they are dealing with a serious manufacturer's error that they're not bothering to remedy. The spring that allows you to open the iron and for it to clamp down on your hair doesn't last long at all. So, they give you an additional spring. That's great, but it still extends the life of your iron to maybe a year, after which both springs are broken and it's time to replace it. It heats up quickly and gets hot enough for me. If there was another manufacturer who made a curling iron with a two-inch barrel, I would try it. Unfortunately, until I find one, I'll keep buying these once a year. (Then again- maybe that's their plan!)"
2,It is NOT a License plate!!,"It looks good and really stands out but it is plastic, about 1/2 inch thick and WILL NOT fit a license plate frame! It is taller and not as wide..."
3,Walmart is cheaper but has fewer screws,Just a cautionary note that the Walmart product I was able to locate has only four screws--although it cost only 97 cents.
1,Absolutely does NOT work,It does stick to the rug but it doesn't even pretend to stick to the floor. My flour is a Korel tile and I got down on hands and knees and washed and dried it before putting the rug down. I stood on it for several minutes and left it alone for hours. It was like I had done nothing. The rubber backing on the rug itself provided more traction than this stuff did. I can't believe they are charging $10.00+ for this stuff. Stay away.
4,Ghetto But Tight,"The beats may be ghetto but they sure are tight. When I heard the beats I just wanted to flow, these beats are dope and they definitely will get you bumpin."
4,the guy below has no idea....,"all i must say is ""see this group in person""---they blew my mind, and right before (or after) animal collective, another amazing group of musicians. the guy below is so vehement about hating certain types of music, namely ANYTHING experimental, that it makes one wonder, ""doth protesteth too much"" or ""is it just out of his realm of comprehension?."" that's okay. he doesn't have to open his mind or his third eye. leave it to the rest of us."
4,Not their best.,"not their best work, but one of my favorites. I prefer Beaches and Canyons, it tends to be a bit more ambient. This one is more like they use the noises as paint to make an abstract. I felt like beaches and canyons was more of a landscape; still very abstract."
5,mucho helpful for beginners like me,"I bought a new scanner and Photoshop Elements was included along with the scanner. This book has been very helpful. It's easy to follow, and there are plenty of examples, screenshots and photos. I don't think I would have figured out how to do so many things in Elements all by myself."
4,Pretty good,I go to this one if I cannot find what I want in the manual that came with Photoshop Elements 1.
4,Recommended!,Shows off the best things in Elements with good photos and good exmaples of how to put Elements to use. All the images show Windows Elements. But I didn't have a problem following with my Mac. Only wish is for all the photos to be in color.
4,Good album,"I didn't know who the hell this guy was when I saw this @ my local record store, but I knew he was in the Oldominion crew, and after bumping Greyskul's last album all summer I thought I'd check this out, plus I noticed it had Masta Ace on it and that's always a plus. Well I have to admit I didn't really care for this album much at first. The beats range from irritating to stellar, and this cat raps so fast on certain cuts that it's nearly impossible to distinguish what he's saying, I guess it's impressive, but those are the tracks I've been skipping since I picked this up last month. #5 is by far the best song on the whole disc, real positive well flowed lyrics over a moving beat that goes real hard. The Masta Ace track was a little dissapointing, but by no means garbage. I'd recomend this CD, it's nothing classic, but well worth peeping out."
5,GREAT PRODUCT,You can rely on this company 100%. They delivered exactly what they said they would---a rarity in today's world. Many thanks for the terrific book!
4,A valuable addition,"This book is a valuable addition to the popular psychology books on narcissism. Its tone is trenchant yet compassionate and there is surprising humor in it, too. This book was written by a man who is educated and qualified to speak knowledgeably on the subject, yet who writes in accessible prose and doesn't condescend to women at all; rather he respects the difficulty of finding oneself involved in a one-way relationship with a narcissist and gives women information they can really use to improve their awareness of their situation and make the best decisions for their own lives. I read several other books on the subject before this one; I wished I had read this one first. It was very informative as well as comforting and empowering."
2,Nothing Special,"Angelic Layer - Vol. 2 - On a Wing and a Player contains episodes five through eight in the CLAMP series about a young, innocent girl who falls in love with the game of Angelic Layer. Suzuhara is continuing her ""miracle rookie"" run of wins in the Angelic Layer tournament. She is assisted by Mr. Icchan, who is the ""father"" of Angelic Layer, unbeknownst to Suzuhara.This is pretty mediocre stuff from the great studio. Suzuhara is so naiive, she has no personality. The surrounding characters are equally annoying, especially Suzuhara's loud and obnoxious friend Tamayo. The only reason I keep watching is for the battle dolls, or ""Angels,"" which are cool.The best part of volume two is a voice actor interview with Kevin Corn (Satoko) and Monica Riahl (Tamayo). It is great to hear them rank on Angelic Layer and call the characters ""retard"" and ""loser."""
1,Beware,I love these cookies. So I decided to order them in bulk. They arrived stale and smashed. I will be cancelling my next order. I was very disappointed.
3,Low quality for a Fossil bag,"I purchased this bag for my mom's birthday last year and within a month or two the straps became unattached from the bag. I own several fossil bags and many wallets and was very disappointed with the craftmanship of this purse. It could have been a dud; but Fossil has excellent quality, long-lasting bags and this one definitely was not!"
5,Works like a charm,"These baby nail clippers are great. Nice small size for little fingers and I like that the file has a rough and smooth side. My 5 month old now wants to ""help"" when I clip his nails because the nail clipper is bright yellow and fun to look at."
1,it sucks,The baby nail clippers wasn't what i expected to be. The handle wad too small and it would clip my baby skin as i was clipping his nails. don't like it at all.
4,Over all great oven but hard to ignite,"hare to control the ignition when just started. The gas may blow the match/lighter off. Always need several try to light. other than that, it is a great stove"
5,Evocative and unusually intelligent,"Imagine the moody, melodic, evocative sounds of Sarah Maclahchlan or Loreena McKennitt, but with voices that are more ""serious,"" more real, so that unlike voices that are stereotypically beautiful they don't make you forget the words being sung. Then add some instrumentation that is rarely used in pop music, and familiar instruments used in less than usual ways; especially making that rare use of ""emptiness,"" or the silence between sounds and notes. Then comes the best part: lyrics so poetic and intelligent we rarely see their like in pop music. This is Passage's debut CD. Startlingly original! (And believe it or not, they actually sound much BETTER when live!)"
2,Poor quality,"Pros:- Has a few sizes (Like 4.5mm and 9/64) that are uncommon but when you need it you need it.- The 4.5mm wrench worked for what I needed it for, but I doubt it would work on many more bolts before it self destructs.- InexpensiveCons:- Poorly made: They are not uniform, bits of grit and machine oil on them, one of my small ones was bent.- The smallest ones (6 or so) are tiny and given the overall quality of the tools I suspect they are worthless. If you really need tiny wrenches pay more and get reliable ones. Most folks will never need the tiny ones anyway, so why pay for them?- One of the tiny ones was missing (not that I need it, but it should have been there).- The case is worthless. It does not hold the tools securely and the hinge is not long for this world.Recommendation: Pay a little more and get a better set."
1,it sucks,small one breaks and the damn box is cheap so the small ones gets lost or breaks anyways cheap crap
1,Poor item do not buy,The small wrenches were not Allen wrenches they were just a piece of rounded metal. They did not have flat sides so they would not turn the Allen wrench screws. The bigger wrenches looked like they at least had flat parts on them but the smaller ones are worthless. Other reviews have said these wrenches are not the right size. i.e. they are not made to spec. I should have listened
3,It's okay,"The previews I was able to listen to didn't seem to reflect the FULL versions of each song. Some are quite fast and not that great for Tai Chi, Qigong or Yoga, I was a little disappointed."
3,Easy Pull,"I purchased three ""sock aids"" after knee surgery and the Easy Pull works best. Use it every day and couldn't get through this period without it. Or a willing valet."
1,ordered what i thought was red and got blue.,ordered what i thought was red and got blue. other than that shipping was ok. not fast not slow. don't know what else to say pex is pex ... just wanted to color code under the house.
1,I made a mistake,"I mis-read the dates on the reviews. This book may have been great ten years ago, but not today."
2,Poor customer service.,"Good tasting coffee.Unit stopped working after 1 year.Emailed customer service 4 days ago. No response as of yet. There is such a long wait on the phone, this is why I decided to email. Cuisinart must be having alot of problems with their products.Would not purchase this product again. Pending their customer service response time, I might not purchase any cuisinart products in the future."
3,Not Too Bad For A Low Budget Movie,"In THE THIN MAN GOES HOME Nick and Nora visit Nick's parents where Nick solves a case involving sabotage and spies during World War II. No liquor is available at the house and Nick is forced to work while sober.William Powell and Myrna Loy return in the starring roles of the series for the fifth time. They are joined by Lucille Watson, Gloria De Haven and Harry Davenport. Richard Thorpe is the director of this low budget entry."
3,Reading angle issue,"Functionality is not a problem with this products both thermo and hygro.ITs the angle at which you look at the reading.From the sides 45 degree able, its almost impossible to read"
1,Not What I expected,I was somewhat disapointed with this Cd. It included the worst version of TransEurope Express that I've ever heard. I definitely wasn't feelin this cd. It was a complete waste of my hard earned money.
4,Can always find it on amazon,Spookley was smaller than I thought. I was pleased with the DVD . My granddaughter loved it .i was able to surprise her with spookley. It was so hard to find. But you can alway find it on amazon..thank you.
5,Spookley the Square Pumpkin,The Square Pumpkin story is wonderful. My grandson loves watching it. I am very happy that I purchased it.
5,Very entertaining !,Purchased movie for my 4 year old granddaughter (got her the book last year and she loves it ). Movie is now one of her favorites. Music is fun and story is entertaining with a message.
5,Best demo tool I own,"I've used this several ways around the house, from tearing down an old playhouse in the back yard to ripping out my old workbench to build a new one. It's strong yet comfortable and has a ton of uses."
5,BABY OF THE BUNCH,i HAVE THE MID SIZED UNIT AND THE SMALL ONE. THE MID SIZED BAR IS HEAVY AND CAN GET ARM TIERING AFTER A FEW HOURS USING IT. BUT THE SMALL FATMAX BAR IS PERFECT FOR GENERAL DESTRUCTION AND HOME USE. I HAVE ALSO USED IT ON JOBS AND IS LIGHTER AND MORE HANDY. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS FATMAX BAR BUT FILE THE HAMMER HEAD A LITTLE FLATTER AND PUT A BETTER CLAW FOR PULLING NAILS.
5,Best book I ever read!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The book time to let go is a book about a girl named Erin who has these really bad headaches and the doctors dont know what causes them, but they think that the headaches are trigged by her sister Amy's death or by by this guy named David that is in a play with her. David is playing in the opposite roll as her she plays Maria and he plays Tony. David likes Erin and Erin is starting to like David and they get to talking and he is always comforting he rwhen she has a breakdown about her sister Amy dying. Beth one of her friends that she met in the hospital when Amy had got in a car acciden her mother has to get a lung transplant or she will die. Also David wanted Erin to go to a special olympics for mentally challenged kids who are deaf and handicap and when she goes she dresses like a clown."
5,Makes this Memphis Girl Proud!!,"Some of the best music ever recorded, and it all came from a converted movie theatre on E. McLemore! This CD features the best of the best from Stax Records, from the early 60's to the mid-70's. Some of my favorites:""Green Onions""-Booker T. and the MG's""Soul Finger""-The Bar-Kays""Soul Man""-Sam & Dave""Theme from Shaft""-Isaac HayesIf you're into classic R&B;, you must add this to your collection."
4,Stax brings back memories,This is a great compilation with many hits you'll remember and some you won't but will hear where hits that followed got their inspiration. Very enjoyable.
5,Excellent Bargain!!,"For the price of a single CD, you get two discs with 50 slices of prime Memphis soul in a nicely compacted and novel box. What more can you ask? Some may debate a bit about whether or not the chosen 50 hits are the best 50 from Stax, but the debate would stem from the fact that Stax had so many hits to choose from, which is a wonderful testament for the label. Personally, I think the essential hits are here, and they are sequenced pretty much in chronological order. The often overlooked hit, ""Private Number"" by Judy Clay & William Bell is so-o-o-o great, it almost justifies the cost of this collection by itself. I think Concord Records (who replaces Fantasy Records as owner of much of the Stax catalog after about 3 decades) did a very nice job with this package and I highly recommend this set to any Stax soul fan who wants to carry 50 great cuts with them wherever they go."
3,Stax 50th Anniversary Celebration by Various Artists,"I rate this CD collection as average to mid. A lot of great old songs brought back memories, yet quite a few did not reach the listerner ear. They were throw in to fill the collection. Some may have never been fully released."
4,Nice Show,"My girls, one an 8yo and the other 4yo, loved it. Cute movie. Will watch, and have watched it again already."
5,Great,It made my grand daughter very happy so that makes me thrilled. I'm glad to get her something she likes. I haven't watched it myself.
5,Wonderful for kids and family,I sat down and watched this charming movie of Tinkerbell and her long lost sister. It had a great story line and filled with magical surprises. My daughters watch this often and I enjoy it being on as well.
5,Family loves it.,"Another wholesome movie that all the family enjoys. As an older parent of an 8 year old, all can enjoy these Disney series movies and they are timeless."
2,Could be better,Not my favorite movie. I would never ever recommend this movie to anyone ever ever ever ever ever. I didn't watch the whole thing.
3,Effect of 3D consider nice.,Well the 3D is good but the story is just too ordinary. Relax no trill at all. Good for the kids to watch it.
4,Great combo,The 4 pack DVd is excellent idea !. However the 3d cover on the wrapping should of been on the dvd case itself.
5,Very good,Very good product I would recommend it to people the quality is very good my kids loved it I did too
5,Can't say enough of it,"Once again, Disney has exceeded themselves. My kids loves this movie to pieces. I love it too. I never know what to expect until I slotted it into the DVD tray. I'm happy I bought it after all given that I didn't see a preview. My kids just cant get enough of it."
2,Way to politically correct,"First, I will say this is fine for children and the graphics are charming. Howewver, for an educated adult we can see through the hype and political correctness. The overt correctness ruins it for us adults.The characters are not well balanced racially and in sexual orientation. They put in a Token black,Latinoe and boyish girl. This is not a real depiction of how are society is made up.The Latino girl is depicted with her large butt and hips and her silly speach. The Black is the typical black made palletable for white audiences. (you know the type, all white features and a slightly tinted brown complexion. One Asian and an american Indian.Films are supposed to be art. Not extension of the DNC."
5,Gorgeous!,"This is a lovely story beautifully crafted for children of all ages, but particularly alluring for little girls. The message is clear and non-controversial, and the cinematic art is wonderful. Young girls (and probably older as well) will enjoy this take of sisterly love."
3,Cute,"My 4 year old daughter enjoyed it. But, she loves anything with fairies. Cute movie with a cute story line. Although, some of it was difficult for her to follow."
5,Great family movie,We loved this - even our 6 year old son. This was a sweet and funny movie - great for family movie night!
5,Very family oriented.,"Everybody loved it. Excellent, as most Disney movies are. The children specially enjoyed the story and the graphics. I couldn't ask for more."
5,Wow!!!,"It's been 3 years since I played the game and when I saw it at the store I was a tade skeptical. However when I read it I remember why I used to play the mage its all here, from elves to orcs and from Paladins to Goblins. A totally enjoyable read."
2,Another generic by Knaak,"Knaak is the most generic author of all-time. His characters are bland, and even though he's hand-fed the events that take place they still somehow manage to be less than exciting. He makes his own characters the stars of the tale when they didn't even exist in the real lore. Not only do they not belong there but they are some of the most boring and generic characters around."
3,Standard Novel,"This is a good start for the Warcraft novels - and if you played the games, you will see little that reminds you of them, as it seems the world has been fleshed out alot more since Warcraft II ( the last I played ).It is typical fantasy, but a few things are different, as in dwarfs do NOT hate elves. And there are dwarves that live in the mountains, as well as dwarves that fly the dragons ( a very odd thing going from most fantasy worlds, as dwarves are normally scared of heights)But honestly if you ever played the game or enjoy fantasy this book should be on your reading list somewhere. And as for the story, it is still very standard of fantasy - but the author is well respected in the field and, from what I can tell has never written a book I did not enjoy."
4,Beyond narrative education,"I enjoyed reading 'The Habit of Thought' - a sign that the author had some enjoyment in writing this book. And I found many points to relate to my own education.I enjoyed most the discussion of teaching mathematics, physics and science from a Socratic discussion view point, rather than the conventional dictation most of us recieved for as many years as I can remmeber. I did not recieve true Socratic education until later graduate education at the doctoral level in this country.Furthermore, Mr.Strong's point that most software and manuals theses days require a new conceptual understanding from the reader, bears notice. A true understanding of many of our current practices in our information society requires achieving a higher conceptual level of thought. Socratic process may hold the key to more quickly and successfully teaching children, than the current methods geared to just more focused narrative educational methods of more money and better student to teacher ratios."
2,Pass This Up and Order the DVD!,"This is a great concert! I saw it aired back in 2004 when it was first recorded. So I was excited to see that it was available for download. Unfortunately, this file they're selling for $9.99 only contains the first half of the show! As the file is ending you can even hear the announcer telling the crowd that there will be a 15 minute intermission before the next set...What a letdown. There's a really cool part of this concert where the band does more acoustic versions of Owner of a Lonely Heart and Roundabout, and they're not included in this download. So do yourself a favor and order the DVD. You won't regret it!"
4,Yes -35th Anniversary DVD!!!,"After seeing YES opening night of the 35th Anniversary Tour in Seattle, I have been waiting for this Collection of tunes to be available on DVD.They were better on this DVD than their opening night for sure!! A couple months later into the tour shows the honing of the YES we've all come to love over the years. Including the Very Special Acoustic Set this 2 DVD set is well worth it!What a special treat to have seen them over 15 times live since 1971 and now with Dolby 5.1 sound quality I can crank up the volume to simulate a Live YES Concert anytime I want!!! YES, YES!!, YES, YES!! Let's hope for more of the same in the future. ENJOY!!!"
5,"Superb concert, excellent double DVD","What can I say that's not been said before? Five outstanding musicians that conform an excellent band. This concert compiles 35 years of music craftmanship and passion. The first half of the second DVD is an acoustic section with several of their beloved classic songs. Don't miss by any means that piece of art called ""Long Distance Runaround"" ... it's worth the price of the double DVD by itself.Yes fans, don't waste your time reading any longer... click for it!"
5,New release date 6/12/05,"Yes. (pardon the pun) Once again we must wait for ANOTHER delay of this DVD. Image entertainment has a new release date of 6/12/05. Sounds like Howe and Anderson are nervous about their solo DVD releases?! I just hope that Songs from Tsongas has not been ruined by cheesy graphics and poor editing like the Keys to Ascention DVD. I hope this new DVD is worth the wait. It should be clear by now to Yes fans that we cannot trust yesworld.com for any info about Yes releases...they almost never get it right, and are the last to warn fans of delays, give explanations, etc."
2,Psycho-Drama of building,"Unlike most others, I disliked this book. I tried to get through it twice, separated by a few years, but I give up.I'd hoped that this would offer fresh insights to building, but it was simply a painful replay of the psycho-drama involved: who's going to take the risks, who's going to ""win"" in what is presented as a zero-sum game.No wonder so many people end up hating their builders, and no wonder builders approach customers with distrust!I'm a serial renovator and will soon be building from the ground up. I'd suggest that there IS another approach - it's called teamwork. Do the research and make the effort upfront and find a builder you can work with and trust. Keep them running a tight budget with multiple bids but be respectful of their risk too! It's possible to create an environment in which everyone wins: on projects this significant, it's worth working to create it."
5,"Elegant story of people, emotions and unusual point of view","Very elegant analysis of people who buy a home with excellent details, very human experience.Delightful facts about how houses are built that you would never think of.Excellent overview in details here and there that add color and life to the overall story"
1,..Bloody Awful',"If you have never seen or heard of the Rolling Stones you might be able to sit thru this. Otherwise this is one of those fake paste up jobs that mostly only sell on Amazon. It's all pieced together footage from the public domain and still images from the other 100 Stones books. The worst part are the narrators. A bunch of cheesy old has beens in search of a payday. And to a one they are bloody awful, at both reading and speaking. The one old ungroomed fart actualy....talks..... about......this.....fast....for....quite.......some........time. We see a 20 second clip of Mick Taylor speaking. That's about it for him. .Poor John Mayall narrates a bit and is as interesting as yesterdays coffee cup. No one deserves to steal your money like this. If you must have it, please find someplace to rip it for free on line. I think I will have a look at Amazons return policy."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I've been duped into buying these type before, absolutely nothing new, and none of the good footage I was hoping for. Just a bunch of random interviews by people I've never heard of. Dang. This DVD is REALLY WEAK"
5,Great Book,"It's about time our favorite pastime be pulled from the recesses of morality and be recast in an intelligent and palatable light. Mr. Murninghan and Ms. Field have truly done justice to this end. In particular, I was completely floored by Darcy Cosper's ""A Story Problem,"" in which she dissolves the story to its most basic components and functions, replaces the characters with letters as if to solve for an algebraic equation, and then, in the most playful and equivocal way, both asks the reader to solve for the variables while solving them for us. This example was in particular; there were many others in this anthology that were brilliant."
3,"Valuable, if less than stellar","Scriabin is a composer whose genius very likely does not get the credit it deserves. Highly appreciated by scholars and highly trained musicians, he seems to baffle those who have difficulty reconciling his opus 11 and 74 sets as having come from the same composer. The complete two cd set recorded by Zarafiants is valuable because of the sheer number of pieces it includes. The transition from the romantic/Chopin-inspired early pieces to the completely individual and challenging pieces at the end is made palatable here. It plays almost like a biography of the composer. Having said all that, Zarafiants is not remotely the greatest performer I've ever heard with Scriabin. It's quite a bit syrupy, typical, and uninvolved. It's...nice playing, that's all. For stellar playing, look up Sofronitsky, Pletnev, Horowitz, and Richter. Still, for the price and the completeness (even includes some pieces by Scriabin's son), this is a nice addition to a collection."
1,Very Bad Tansmutation,"I need them for long distance in my house but it doesn't work, the picture fluctuating and audio keep give noise.The units become very hot quickly.I don't recommend them."
5,"Fantastic, unpredictable, love the characters","Sharon Carton has written a masterpiece. As I was reading I was sure I would be able to guess what would happen next but every time she surprised me completely which rarely happens to me.Jack and Ernie are fantastic characters that became ""friends"" as I read and I can only hope that Ms. Carton has more books on the horizon with equally intriguing characters.Kudos to the author for continuing to surprise me, as I read I found myself in disbelief at the twists and turns taking place before me.Truly a book you will not want to put down, order it immediately and enjoy the roller coaster ride the author will take you on. I dare you to be able to put it down!"
2,Italian Celine Dion not cut out for the American Audience,"Pausini had a voice of her own until now. She sounds so much like Celine Dion, its depressing. I hope she retires in English because she just doesn't do it. This recording only sold a meager 45,000 copies. Not that she has no talent, but the lyrics are weak and forgettable. There are no bright moments, and this cd is overall boring. Tres boring! No wonder only 45,000 people bought it. Get ""Entre tu y mil mares"" instead or her previous productions."
4,Great for sealing envelopes,"It's glue what can I really say about it? The reason I purchased these glue sticks was I got to thinking one day while paying bills about all the envelopes I lick during the year. Did you ever really consider where those envelopes have been stored, how old they are or what germs might be on them? We wash our hands to try and keep them germ free yet we lick some envelope that has God knows what on it. So no more envelope licking for me, it's glue sticks all the way and these are the best ones for the job!"
2,NOT repositionable,"The product is the permanent glue sticks in the picture, Not repositionable like the title and product description states they are. The company was great about replacing them but after 4 tries, still not the item that was described. A+ on customer service, F on Product description."
3,"After a year, this album has lost me...","Last year i gave this album a five star review when i just gotten it and listened to it a few times. Almost exactly a year later, this album has lost me. After a while all the songs sounds a little cliche, especially for modern American Oi! They're still good, but its easy to get sick of this style of Streetpunk, especially after you've heard classic Oi and RAC from Britain and America. Get this, but don't expect a classic. It is violent and patriotic, which is always good, but it could have been done about ten times better had the band expanded their sound a little bit."
5,"Lost In The Shuffle, Don't Miss Out!","This is a classic Rock/Country album that has been lost or not known about by many. If you are reading this BUY THE ALBUM!! And don't look back. These are some of the best song ever recorded. Play ""My Home Town"" by Montgomery Gentry and then take it out and throw it as far as you can and put in ""Guitar Town"" and tell me who can write a song! The last two songs on the album are two of the best. That alone should tell you of the quality of the songwriting."
3,Gazebo is great-The net cannot be sold separatedly,"The Gazebo is excellent and very durable. However, there is no way to buy a new netting you must buy the $169.97 Gazebo with the netting if you need the netting alone. Too bad."
3,Thinking about not thinking,I bought this for Kindle and have read about half of it. It's a good exposition of the author's personal journey but he seems to spend a lot of thought about the process of not thinking. I suppose that is necessary to writing whereas I'm a photographer and my responses are more visual. If you've never encountered Zen there are better books about the philosophy behind Zen. If you are looking for a creative prod it may be helpful.
4,Zen book,Find it interesting. Easy read. Very encouraging and helpful words from author to find the Zen way to creativity. Concept can be applied to many facets of life.
1,Painkillers Should Be Included.,"Well with the likes of Barbra Streisand, Gladys Knight and David Sanborn this should be a good album right?? Wrong.From the opening bars of Leann Rimes torturing 'Everything I Do' you know it's not going to be a good session. A strange brew of selections from the aforementioned 'Everything I Do' to 'Misty' to 'Alphie'. I was still hopeful it would improve with a tune by Barbra streisand but even she couldn't pull this one together. The whole album is lifeless and not even worth a listen."
2,Nothing between Nothing,"What was I thinking, anyways? The same vapidity that one usually gets from KG. Here again, it is unfortunate that always one expects more from Kenny G. But at the end of the play it is always the smae."
4,favorite,This is one of my favorite artists. He did not disappoint with this CD. Smooth jazz tunes and duets with familiar songs.
5,great book!,"This is a great book, he even seems to be able to add some humor to such a special topic. He presents a great argument for why he thinks that Sex is sacred, too bad my husband has no desire to read this book. I think it should be required reading for couples in pre marital counseling or in marriage counseling and any couple who care to increase their joy together."
1,Too easy to tip bike over,"I've owned lots of different kinds of bike stands over the years and this is the worst ever.I've got a couple of bikes stored on these, and they're stored together in a corner of a garage where I keep my bike tools, accessories, pump, etc. Seems like I can't grab either one of my bikes or any other biking gear without knocking one of my bikes over. I realize that it would stay upright if I didn't hit it. But a bike standing in a rack ought to be able to withstand a gentle nudge without falling over.I've examined these several times to make sure I've assembled them correctly - I think it's just a faulty design. The wheels help get the whole thing rolling, and once they slide just a bit after tapping the bike, the bike is history.Maybe the folks who like these racks are just less clumsy than I am. Well - that's almost certainly true. But still, these are too prone to allowing my bikes to fall.Soon headed for the dumpster..."
1,Could be Better,"This bike stand does not stand flat on the floor after assembly. Luckily for me, I am handy with altering simple metal products to suit my needs. If I was'nt, I would have sent it back for a refund. I can't recommend this product unless you want to add your own extra hardware to make it function properly."
2,Evaluation of Delta Rothko Rolling Bicycle Stand,This bicycle stand is a fine product in all features except one. The arches had a tendency to lean against the spokes in my wheel. I expect over time the spokes would need adjusting sooner.
5,.Primal Core of Being is Searched For--At Least in Theory,"It feels awkward to discuss a band that one just discovered--hence seeming to fall prey to the ""newness effect,"" and thus overpraising since it is initially liked to a strong effect. But....An improvised quality--without too many gaps of seeming ""noodling""--recalls the seekers of the cosmos like the Taj Mahal Travelers of thirty years past. Using repetition and treating the instruments in ways that creates electronic otherness, a sort of search for the galactic occurs; especially on the earlier Letters From the Earth. This album is not as minimally dense and signal-to-noise focused as Letters, but enjoys a higher musicality-- albeit a less interesting overall sound experience nonetheless.21st century rock bands:a tidal wave of crap washed up on our present cultural landscape. No Neck Blues Band is a puddle of refreshing blissed out setiment, worth settling one's feet in."
5,One of the Best Trance Albums Ever,"This album is perhaps the best pop vocal trance album ever, with the others being Ian Van Dahl's ""Lost and Found,"" Alice Deejay's ""Who Needs Guitars Anyway,"" and 4 Strings ""Believe."" There is no filler here, almost every single track has an amazing hook and beat. Unlike most trance albums, the lyrics are actually really good and the songs don't all sound alike. As a matter of fact, each song is somewhat different. This album is proof to the naysayers who claim that trance music is not art. This is a gem of an album, and look for the follow-up ""Unique"" in May 2007!"
4,Feel Good Album of the Year,"Intuition not only will make you want to dance, it will make you fall in love, sing the words, and turn up that volume. From beautiful slow songs with Engelina's angelic voice to encore's hot dance techno/trance mixes that make you want to get up and jam...you defintly can find yourself making a connection with this album. My personal favorites are chemistry, youve got a way, out there and open your eyes. Let the music be apart of you with Engelina's gourgeous voice...and Andreas B. Henneth's (encore)tite beats!"
4,Good Stuff...,"The reason why I purchased a copy of this album, was because I heard an acoustic version of high on life.. Even though the album version isn't quite as good, I still found a lot to cherish on this album..The vocals are lovely and the album always cheers me up... Definetely worth a try..."
2,Quite disappointing,"well i would say this was quite a disappointing realease.I bought this from amazon and only when i listened it i only liked I see right threw to you from the whole realease.This is nothign like Lasgo or Ian van dahl ,but i think DJ ENCORE has the chance for a comeback with the next realease this year !"
1,BEGINNER'S Only,"This is a really simplified take on sports writing. Might work for high school kids, but it's very minimal in its approach."
3,Different,"The prose is gorgeous. However, I am not entirely comfortable with the interpretation of the Arthurian legend. Not sure if I will read the next in the series."
3,Awkward fit...,"It works, but the base plate of the fixture hanging from it is slightly crooked. Had to work with it for a little while to get it to fit at all. Overall, it is functional and looks decent for a plastic unit. Not too many alternatives readily available online, so I suppose you could do worse if you can't get to a local fixture store."
4,D.C.; a view inside the beltway before there was a beltway,"I revisited this autobiography after the unfortunate passing of Mrs. Graham. Her insights to government business and the media has served as an invaluable reference as I teach U.S. Government and AP Government and Politics to high school seniors. Her anecdotal stories served to make the story of her marriage to the Washington Post most interesting. Her story-telling style indicates a woman who might have been approachable, and in turn, insightful to the needs and wants of many of the folks who worked for the Post.However, there were two underlying themes that remind the reader that she was from another social strata. The first was her incessant name dropping and the fact that she was clueless to the dynamics of her marriage.I have only two criticisms: the name dropping and her acknowledgment of the fact that she had never ironed an article of clothing. Although it may be true, that is not something of which I would boast, or even admit."
1,Stilted prose killed my interest almost immediately.,"I dove into this book with high expectations, but it read like a time line. Little synthesis, bad prose. Very disappointed - maybe I didn't hang in there long enough?"
4,"Wow, what a life...","Katharine Graham's autobiography reveals much, including the difficult and tragic end of her marriage, her courage as a woman in a man's world to run the Washington Post, and all the nitty-gritty insider politics of her era.Worthwhile and fun. And revealing!"
5,An extraordinary American story.,Survives a wealthy childhood with major problems. Survives and outlives a marriage that goes disastrously wrong. Survives to take over a family business that directly influences American history. This woman is a survivor. Mrs. Graham provides an inside look at key events of the last few decades and offers insightful firsthand portraits of dozens of prominent figures. A remarkably honest and generous book by one of America's most famous and admired women. Mrs. Graham's wonderful book is composed of both personal memoirs and history. This is nothing less than an extraordinary American story by one of the most powerful women of her time.FinancialNeeds.com
5,People in Pineapple Place,"Wonderful story for any elementary school age child who lives in the Washington, DC area. The story takes place in Georgetown with a trolly ride to Glen Echo."
5,Perfect for Saving Private Ryan fans and WWII agers.,"This disc features Edith Piaf singing ""Tu es partout,"" the song heard in Saving Private Ryan in the scene where Tom Hanks and co. are sitting outside a small French house listening to the record playing and Cpl. Upham is talking about the meaning of the song. THIS SONG IS NOT ON THE OFFICIAL SOUNDTRACK - THIS IS THE ONLY PLACE YOU CAN FIND IT! The rest of the disc is a great collection of WWII era songs by the original artists. Nostalgia buffs and everybody's grandparents will love this."
2,"Cheap, do the job, but maybe there is something better out there","Basically, you get what you pay for. These are cheap covers, and they protect well. But the fit to car seats is not good. I have a BMW325i and a prius 2010, and the outer edges of these keep curling out. The adhesive on velcro at bottom is no good either.If you want something that hugs the seat nicely, look elsewhere."
4,A must for your car!,"I bought this for our new car (Honda Pilot) to protect it from my child's feet. It has worked really well and kept the back of the seat pristine. My only complaint is that it doesn't fit well in our other vehicle because of the way the seatbelt is designed. I can't put the elastic over the seat because it restricts the seatbelt. However, as long as the seat is freestanding, it shouldn't be a problem for you. Great value for the money."
4,Worth the price,"With a seven year old dirting up the rear of tan color seats with his feet,we needed something to save them. These inexpensive seat covers worked out great. They were easy to install, with a snug fit, and keep the bottom of shoes and wet boots from touching the seat material. Definitely worth the money."
3,Spanish English translator,This translator works well and the price is right. However the vocabulary is very limited. There are words in my 5 year old's spanish story books that are not in this dictionary.
1,Busy hands on rainy days or Arts and Crafts on Saturdays,IT WAS A FULL TWO DAYS BEFORE I REALIZED THAT I HAD RECIEVEDMY ORDER FOR A (BOOK ?) PAMPHLET ON THE COLLECTION OF BEERSTEINS. THIS WAS NOT AT ALL WHAT I HAD ANTICIPATED. MY FIRSTTHOUGHT WAS THAT IT WAS AN ADVERTISMENT. NOT WORTH THE MONEYOR WAIT
1,Not worth the money,This works amazing -- for the first 10 feet or so... then it gets covered in paint and makes you wish you had used tape. It cuts into the painting you have done leaving patches with no paint that you have to go over and after about 40 feet of painting the pivot broke on two different models...And don't even get me started on the pads!
4,Great Tool for the DIY'er,"So if you've been painting professionally for 20+ years then this may not be the tool for you but for the rest of us DIY'ers... We started with painters tape around the trim and it started to peel the paint once we removed it. It was recommended we try this tool. We did try it and with very little practice I was edging the walls, baseboards and ceilings with no problems. The baseboards are too skinny for the wheels to fit on them but the tool slid nicely on the baseboard without the wheels. I did use a paper towel to apply paint to the tool making sure not to get any on the edge or wheels. I'm sure a paint brush would help apply the paint too. Essentially, just make sure the paint is on the pad and nothing else and then edging is very easy. I would recommend this and will use it again."
1,only useful if you don't care about quality,"It does save time compared to taping. But the quality is horrible. You have to have an iron-steady arm to hold the thing tight so it doesn't mess up the ceiling or door trims. The painting is streaky, you have to carefully use roller on top of it to smooth the texture (while at the same time trying not to get too close to the ceiling). And it could get messy applying paint to this thing - you can easily get paint all over it.And it doesn't work on the baseboard lines since the wheels can't hold on to it.So bottom line, use it if you desperately want to avoid taping no matter what. But if you care about details and quality, then this thing won't cut it."
3,Not Bad but a Poltergiest catch,"When anyone sits down to watch this movie many movies will come to your head while watching Silent Predators because it is a movie that copied off of many classic movies like Poltergiest and Jaws and many others. The plot is very simple but the writers I think could have been a little more creative like the new development is just like Poltergiest and instead of bodys under the house there are snakes under the house there is a real estate agent guy just like that guy in Poltergiest trying to cover up everything, and is sort of like Jaws also, and of course a corny love story also falls into the pie with some egotistical guy who saves the day and falls crazy for some chick. Same old Same old nothing new."
4,professional quality for a good price,"pros - definitely salon quality, heats quickly, adjustable temperature dial, doesn't catch or pull on hair, straightens pretty quickly, leaves hair looking super smooth and healthycons - i have long hair, and i'm used to a 2"" straightener (rather than 1 3/4""), so it takes a bit longer than i'm used to. also sometimes it takes two passes to get a section totally straight.so far, a very good buy for the price (especially the lower amazon price) and professional quality. the real test will be how long it lasts before the heating element wears out. for the price, i'm hoping to get two years of regular use out of this one, but i've never used an FHI before, so we'll see!"
3,Burned out.,"Lasted 1 year then stopped working! I guess it's pretty common for the eletrical part to burn out or something. Otherwise, it is a WONDERFUL flat iron."
1,Microsoft Outlook 2007,"As the title I ordered was the Unofficial Guide to Microsoft Office, you can well understand (by looking at the title being reviewed) that I was not pleased. This is the second book this year that has not been what I ordered. I am losing money in return shipping. Does anyone monitor this process?"
5,great until drugs and the 1960s did him in,"i hate it when people romanticize the 1960s drug culture. they must not have seen the wrecked lives i saw. the 1960s and drug use were an unmitigated disaster for working class young people. tim hardin coulda been great. he shoulda been great. unfortunately he was a junkie. he never lived up to his potenial. live at town hall (""tim hardin live in concert"") was his best album. there is only one song from that album on this cd. its a shame. almost 40 years later i can still remember his heartbreaking song ""lenny's tune"" (from that album) for his friend and fellow junkie lenny bruce. that song and others should be on this cd. along with bob dylan and joni mitchell, tim hardin was one of the very best 1960s singer songwriters. drug use and the 1960s did him in. these few great songs are all we have left."
4,this cd is confusing,"it doesnt sound like the typical used we're used to hearing on their self-titled album. they yell a whole lot more and try to act like theyre really rock instead of more punk. i really didnt like it. the used should stick to their sweet emo punk selves insteasd of trying to do some death metal type screaming. i have a headache just from listening to it. i love the group tho, and you should get the cd, see if its to your liking."
1,"No doubt, the man knows how to mix, but....","In all the fury of lacing out a hurricane of tracks, Bad Boy Bill tends to overlook quality, focusing on quantity instead...Beatmixing makes not a DJ my man, ease up a lil' sum sum and dig in dem crates for better records!"
4,"Good map, not terribly detailed though","The folding edges of this map were cleverly designed. The whole map is laminated and at the points where the map folds there's a break in the map so only the clear plastic lamination folds. I thought it was kind of weird at first to have breaks in the map like that, but then I realized that this way would keep roads/towns on the creases from becoming hard to read over time, and I think that's pretty clever. The front of the map has central MD and DE, the back has the panhandle and some city insets. The map isn't terribly huge, so there's not really much detail beyond the main roads, but since that's what I wanted I'm ok with that."
2,Looks and feels cheap,"The photo makes it look better than it is. In reality, it is a paper-thin piece of metal that both looks and feels cheap."
2,Not ready for prime time,"I've used GoLive since version 4, and this is without a doubt, a step backwards. On my G4 533DP, this product is terribly slow when working with sites with more than a few hundred files. Random crashes are frequent, requiring me to do a ""save"" after almost every operation. It appears that Adobe rushed to get this one out the door. I'm hoping a point-fix is released soon addressing the performance and bugs."
1,Please Think Twice,I strongly do not recommend this instrument to any potential buyer. I had a new clarinet student who was given this clarinet by her parents who were not experienced clarinet buyers. When my student recieved this clarinet it could not be peiced together. The corks were in need of considerable sanding. Also It was very difficult to keep the clarinet in tune. Even a beginning player should have had an easier time with it. Those parents looking for a cheap instrument for their new music student should think twice and buy something with more quality. A child who posseses this instrument can become easily discouraged and will want to give up because they think playing it is too difficult. A decent beginners clairinet will quickly help. Ask a reputable dealer for suggetions. It will make a world of difference to your child.
4,Great for getting started,"This is the book I turned to most when I started raising a backyard flock. It's written in easy-to-understand language and covers a number of topics such as coops and nest boxes, waterers and feeders plus ailments to look for.It's obvious the author loves chickens, and this shows in the pages of this helpful book."
5,The perfect mix of Afrikan and Islamic history!,"Asalaamu Alaikum if you're looking for a truthful account of what happen during slavery to the West African Nation tribes of the Wolof, Fulani, Mandinka, Mandingo, Tukor, Hausa and How they affected the culture and the traditions of the new world in the Diaspora then read this Book!!As a Muslim and man of AfriKan decent, i can honestly tell you this is one of the most well researched books i have ever read on the history of the Trans atlantic slave trade. The author has a great understanding of AfriKan customs, traditions, mysticism, and history. And her understanding of Islam as practiced in West Afrika is food for thought for the novice and the scholar.Any Afrikan or Muslim should have this on their bookshelf"
2,Returned it,"Sleeping bag and stuff sack have a very cheap feel to them. The stuff sack feels like it could tear easily when getting the bag back in. The zipper got REALLY stuck (literally 5 minutes of wrangling) on our first try with it and does not zip smoothly (even for adults). Can't say how well the bag performs in the cold, as we decided to return it 20 minutes after receiving it. For the same price, we got a very decent quality adult sleeping bag (that my child will fit into) with a lower temperature rating."
5,My kid really likes this sleeping bag,"My boy, who is 7 years old, said he really liked this sleeping bag. He thought it looked cool. More importantly, he said it kept him warm. We went camping in mid-November (in Southern California) and it was raining and got down to 48 degrees, but it kept him warm and he slept fine in it. (Granted, we were inside a tent, so we didn't really have to worry about the rain.) The bag was huge for him, so I'm sure it would be fine for a much larger, older boy."
4,Durable,This sleeping bag is nice and durable - we've washed it several times and it's holding up just fine. The inside material is very 'cold' to the touch until it warms up so we end up putting a fuzzy warm blanket inside to make it 'feel' warm.
3,Don't Expect It To Look Like the Picture,"This is a warning that the bag didn't look like the picture. The inside lining is a lighter gray and there was no orange strip around the mummy part. If you liked the looks of the bag in the picture like we did, the real bag will be a disappointment.Since my son is two we won't be really testing the durability and temperature control of the the bag too much, but the quality and design look solid."
4,Good Camping Bag,"With a carry weight of only 2lbs and 4ozs I thought this would make for a good hiking bag for my 8 year old daughter. Unfortunately I was wrong. The compressed size is a large 14""x9"", with no compression sack, which makes for a tough carrying bag on hikes.My daughter immediately fell in love with this bag, and it appears to be made to last! This would be a great camping/sleepover bag for kids as long as no hiking with it was planned.I'm only returning because we already have a camping bag for her."
3,Not comfortable 30-Degree,I bought this sleeping bag for my son. I used a fleece blanket that would have been warmer.The sleeping bag is OK but not for 30-Degree. I would say that it comfortably at 40 - 50 degree.
4,Creative Labs - Live Ultra Webcam,"Installation was simple except for one flaw in which I had to email Creative technical support for help. The installation went fine and I was able to record video after the install. However, I didn't have any audio to go with the video on playback. I sent an email to Creative Tech Support describing my problem and they responded within 24 hours and provided a weblink to their Knowledge Base that lead me directly to the symptoms of ""No Audio"". I followed their knowledge base instructions and corrected my audio problem. I just wondered why during the installation they didn't take me through the audio set-up if the audio was not automatically configured during installation. Other then that one incident I've been enjoying this option on my PC and in-spite of this initial problem and would recommend this device."
2,Doesn't work with Media Center SP2,"Read all of the reviews, thought it was worth a shot, called them 3 times including my PC manufacturer only to learn that it is not technically supported (the drivers aren't designed) for Media Center. I have XP Media Center 2002 Edition SP2. Had to take it back after geting too tired of trying to find a work around driver. Never really got to see it in action."
1,Would not install AT ALL!!!,"All I needed was a decent webcam for Skype and such. Unfortunately, I haven't had a chance to see how the VF0060 performs because the driver would not install at all. I had good past experience with Creative webcams using the less expensive models VF0040 and VF0050, and I was generally pleased with their performance. The VF0060 was on Black Friday sale for dirt-cheap so I decided to give it a try. Many reviewers across the net mentioned difficulties with installation of the VF0060 and that also has been my experience. I even tried a driver downloaded directly from Creative's support website, but that didn't work either. What a waste of time, and what a totally weird product!The VF0060 shall go back to its vendor and I'm using again my old trusty VF0050.To whom it may concern: the computer I tried to install the VF0060 runs on Athlon 64 3400+ with Windows XP SP2 plus all updates and lots of RAM."
1,Not so great,"Had one of these fail on me after 1 month.Additionally, these cameras are NOT compatible with all USB 2.0 chipsets on motherboards. The device is simply unrecognized by the computer. It works fine on one of my notebook computers, and can not be recognized on my other. It is rather frustrating and Creative Labs will not take responsibility for the problem.Otherwise, video quality is good, mounting to a notebook screen is a bit clunky and falls off pretty often."
3,average satisfaction - high price - no linux drivers,"Plus: The camera works well on Windows, good picture quality and high frame rate.Minus: The software package is mediocre. The remote monitoring software is particularly craptacular.Creative: On Linux I can run very sophisticated security software (eg. zoneminder) with:- zone monitoring- multi-camera- motion-detection- web based remote monitoring. BBut, there are currently no Linux drivers for this camera!Creative - If you're not going to write drivers for Linux, can't you at least give the specs out to the linux users who will write drivers? Linux hackers write better, more efficient and more functional drivers than you do. They also write better software to use the camera, unlike the junk you put on the included CD. I guess I'll return it and get a $19 camera that works great on Linux AND Windows AND Mac"
2,Nice ONLY if you are running XP 32 sp2,"Bottom line, if you expect to upgrade your OS forget this cam. It will not run under Linux. It will not run under XP x64 and probably never will. After two years of lead time it still only has beta drivers for Vista x32 (none for 64) which do not work and for which there is no tech support. Unfortunately the same can be said for most of the creative cam products. Unless you want to be hung out to dry buy some other brand."
2,Not advised,"Pro:- The included headset is good- the big round silver ring you see is for adjusting focus- wide angle- CCD gives better light sensitivityCon:- Can't work in Linux as the Logitech can.- drives a AthlonXP 3200+ with 512Mb above 90% CPU usage in windows 2000 when at 640X480.- gets out of sync every now and then when using with Openwengo , gives dropped framesI am replacing it with the Logitec QC pro 5000, wish I could efford the fusion."
2,Meh...,"I wasn't a big fan of these keys. They look really artificial as if someone painted sloppy all over them. They are of nice quality though and when you get the keys, it is at random. So you get duplicates of some of them and the best ones in the picture, I did not receive because it is at random of what is in stock and what isn't."
4,"Good book, if you know what you're looking for...","I have found this book to be a great reference when I'm working on formulas and formatting in Excel. The only reason I did not give this review 5 stars is because, sometimes, it's hard to find the answer to a question unless you know exactly what you're looking for. The answers are in there, there's just not always a clear path to them. Otherwise, a great reference book!"
4,Excel 2007,Very informative. It does skip a little going from one subject to another and back to it later. Not recommended for beginners.
3,Very repetative,"Too repetative, after the first few songs I have to turn it off, just too repetative."
1,bad french,I can't help thinking about this french...so bad! I'm sorry but I need to understand somethink in this music! BUT..The quartett is very good! Sorry..I've given it Petit
3,"Too Much Too Soon, Windows Vista Secrets: SP1 Edition","At this time only a 3 rating as I have not used it enough. Those few items that I have used it have been pretty clear and helpful. Do not think it is for a beginner though, or even one that has some experience with Vista and or Windows. For sure it makes me want to learn so much more about Vista, and I will."
1,A book for newbies ...,"This is everything but a tech book, most of what is inside can be discovered by anyone who's a literate computer user. It's full of screen capture of Vista usage, but if you're new to computer and need a step by step guide to understand what you can do in Vista, this can be a solution ... If you're literate or an ITpro, forget it."
3,OKAY...,When I recieved this in the mail I was so excited because I've been craving the smell of warm vanilla sugar but instead it has more of a lemony scent which was a dissappointment because I wanted everything I used to smell the same. But regardless it doesn't feel like it's doing anything more that soap does but I guess I have to wait for long term results.
3,Soleil the bi**h!!!,"I saw this movie playing on a tv in a video store a year or so ago and i noticed that soleil was in it.. I was a BIG Punky fan and loved her in everything since. ""Liars Club"" was an incredible movie.. So of course i had to see this one.. I was not able to get it the day I first saw it, bu ti swore i would see it.. I found it in a store today and rented it.. it was better than i expected being that it is a made for tv horror film.. I half expected it to be like ""Killing Mr. Griffin"" and totally bite.. but it didnt.. i actually enjoyed it and am going to buy a copy.. Christian Campbell, Sarah Chalke, and especially Soleil Moon Frye stick out in this flik.. They were definitely shining spots in the film.."
4,Bandstand,"Totally in agreement with the previous poster as to this album being their best work. And it shows why they had a cult following instead of becoming immensely popular. Their music was too complex to be pop but it was too ""pop"" to be prog rock. Still a very good album by a very interesting band."
1,No DeYoung = No Sale for me,"Title of this review says it all. Don't be fooled into thinking this is the original Styx, or even a decent cover band. Tommy, drop JY and go solo."
1,Only for Money,"The current version of Styx is just a glorified Styx cover band. JY and Shaw hate DeYoung so much, and yet they have guts to sing the songs that DeYoung composed night after night, tour after tour. They are in for the love of money. They recently removed DeYoung from the history section of Styx's official Web page! Without DeYoung, there would be no Styx. Stop making money from DeYoung's songs."
2,Loud does'nt make up for old age,"Sorry guys, excessively LOUD instrumental drowning out voices shoeing the signs of age does not make a concert more appealing. The harmonies are still good but the instrumentals were way overdone!"
5,This will be amazing,"Saw parts of this in concert, Tommy Shaw, James JY Young, Chuck Pannozo, Lawremce Gowan, Todd Sucherman and Ricky Phillips are very talented, great showman! The whole production was not done in my area so am so thankful this is taped for our enjoyment."
5,"""THIS IS THE STORY""","This CD compilation of LPs by The Supremes is long overdue. Creative packaging, beautiful photographs, informative text, recording dates, juicy Motown tidbits, credits, and great music make this exquisite album booklet an instant collectible. Mary Wilson finally gets her chance to sing lead and The Supremes have never sounded better...up to this point, but stay tuned! Only the previously unreleased ""Promises Kept"" cuts from the can disappoint. Universal must have spent a mint on this expensive package, yet ironically did nothing to promote ""THIS IS THE STORY"". Supremes fans are eagerly awaiting the release of the last three albums by The Supremes featuring Scherrie Payne...plus Mary Wilson's solo LP and ""Partners"" by Scherrie Payne and Susaye Greene, both released in 1979 after The Supremes disbanded in 1977."
5,Adventure!,So glad to find these videos! Had taped them in the '80s when they first aired & those tapes have deteriorated so badly. Lorne & Lawrence Blair have such a questing sense and carry you right along with them. This summarizes 10 years of exploration in Micronesia -- I only wish they hadn't stopped at only 4 tapes.
3,Satisified-but not evrrything it needs to be!,The adapter selection is great. The most popular adapter for GM and Jeep vehicles is to small for the opening of the radiator. I have to revert to my 30 year old stant tester to test my most popular models. Somewhat disappointed!
3,Caps don't seal correctly at times,"This kit would works ok, but I have tried other adapter that work better from Stant that seal up better on both the cap style and the screw incert style. One instance on the cap style if its cocked a little will leak because of how it's made"
5,complete service manual for american flyer trains,"EXCELLENT DETAILED PART LISTS,ENGINE AND TENDER EXPLODED VIEWS,INCLUDES LOCOMOTIVE AND TENDER IDENTIFICATION,FEATURES,DATES OF MFG,AC/DC SPECIFICATIONS,WIRING DIAGRAMS(ENGINE AND TENDER)EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO REPAIR AND MAINTAIN YOUR AMERICAN FLYER ENGINE AND OPERATING CARS AND ACCESSORIES,FOR MANY MORE YEARS TO COME,WELL WORTH THE COST!!!!NOTE:THIS BOOK IS NOT AUTHORIZED NOR APPROVED BY AMERICAN FLYEROR BY THE A.C. GILBERT CO. OR THERE SECCESSORS."
4,"Solid, Undefinable stories","These stories are solid, some better than others, that cross literary genres. Schow is different, and his stories are always eccentric, startling in some respects, and if that's what you like and need in a short story, read these. You will not be disappointed. A cross between Cormas McCarthy and Harlan Ellison?"
5,Really good instant tea.,If you can get by the sweetness of aspertaime this is really good tea to add to all the free water you get when traveling.
2,Disappointing,"The Lipton drink-stick packets just don't produce the same great taste as their bottled products. While it may be unrealistic to expect them to be identical, these packets fall quite short... The taste is sweet, a little peachy, but not much else. The Crystal Light product has MUCH better taste."
5,A new take on an old story,"From the moment I bought this book, I felt drawn into James Hetley's world. His vivid descriptions and colorful language left me feeling I knew the Summerland better than my own world. His characters have flaws, make mistakes, and sometimes you just want to shake them and say ""Wake up!"" But that's what makes them real.A very modern take on the old story of sucsession and legacy. A wonderful read."
2,"hollow, not solid",since it is hollow the only sticking part is on the edge of the frame so it doesn't hold very well
3,Note on direction,"There is one thing about the book that bothers me a bit. It is written exclusively in North - South direction. All the descriptions, details and warnings work wonderfully if you intend to sail southbound on the ICW, but things get a lot more complicated when changing direction. This may sound silly at first, but when considering that the author has really detailed descriptions in the book, sometimes from marker to marker, reversing everything turns into a real piece of work. You basically end up re-editing significant portions of the book, having to start at the end of a chapter, working your way backward and turning every starboard to port, every East to West, and so on. So here is a challenge for the author: How about publishing the same book in reverse? You could earn double the money, and it would be much easier to follow when traveling in the opposite direction."
3,Cruising Guide to Eastern Florida,"I ordered this guide with the hopes that it had detailed charts. Instead it has a lot of pictures and paragraphs of advice, probably all good, but it is very weak on charts. Also, all photos and the charts it does have are in black and white; a minor thing, but I would be more impressed with color and more detail in the charts. I will keep the book for its writeups and descriptions, but in my opinion it is overpriced and I would not advise its purchase."
2,Looking for more,"I am looking for a Korean piano song called ""Autumn's Tale"" by Korean Drama. I need the sheet music. Can you help me? THANKS Ken Scott"
3,Nothing much added to what we know about Custer,"Jeffery Wert has proven once again that he is an excellent Civil War historian and that is part of the problem with TheControversial Life of George Armstrong Custer.After a cursory swipe at Custer's pre-civil war life, Wert devotes the majority of his book to the Civil War. Not Custer, but the Civil War, battle after battle in incredible detail. Page after page. Major or minor battle, it matters little. Custer's involvement? Sometimes important, most times not. For a Civil War buff (I plead innocent) I imagine this book is a treasure. For a Custer buff (guilty), I would love to have seen the detail devoted to meaningless battles to events in Custer's life such as the day Custer shot his own horse out from under him while chasing buffalo, a silly but telling event in Custer's western life."
5,Very enjoyable for even NON-Christian listeners,"Like other reviewers, I've been looking forward to her solo debut CD.I'm a Japanese and non-christian, but I love this album.Because Debra's vocal and bass playing are very moving.My favorite tracks areMessage In The MusicSurrenderOh My GodJesusBecause Of Your LoveWithout HimI heard she was a member of the band 'Modest Fok',and released an album ""Love Or Single Life"" in 1992.I WISH the CD to be reissued."
4,Creative Labs TravelSound Notebook 500 Speaker System,It's good enough to have it with laptop. The only one drawback of it is to have powerful bass you need to buy a subwoofer as extra item. In gneral I'm sutisfied with it.
5,Love it!!,Hubby bought this for me to replace my Sony DSC-S85 which we lost on vacation. I absolutely love it! It's very user-friendly and takes great shots. I love the zoom; I took a close-up today of a garden spider (which I fear) along with some late blooming flowers. They were clear and crisp. I've had this camera for less than two weeks and I'm truly enjoying getting acquainted with its great features. I recommend the LCS-CSH case for it; it's got lots of padding and plenty of room for camera and accessories without being overly large. Makes a great combo - and a camera this nice deserves to be protected well.
1,Horrible camera! Expect 30-50 terrible pix per battery life.,"Two comments on this miserable camera.-- Battery life is unbelievably short! Not more than 50 shot with lithium or NiMH batteries - and about 32 with Duracell.-- Shutter lag is 2 seconds or more under any circumstances, guaranteeing that just about any shot is missed. You'd think that the shutter lag at least improves clarity with stellar autofocus, but that that is not the case; you'll get blurry shots of your kid's butts running out of frame.Also, low light timed exposure shots are extremely grainy. This camera is inferior to my 3.2mp Kodak in just about every meaningful metric."
3,Where It All Starts Out.,"Ernest Hemingway said somewhere that all American literature starts with Twain's Huckleberry Finn. An equivalent observation for the American film industry would be that all car chase movies start with 1958's Thunder Road. There are alternative theories that go back as far as the wagon escape scene from burning Atlanta in Gone With the Wind or as late as Steve McQueen's Dodge Charger chase in Bullitt in the mid-60s, but for my money, Robert Mitchum's Thunder Road (the screenplay is based on a storyline he wrote) is the real point of origin in what is probably the most characteristic aspect of films in this country for the last half century. For that reason alone, this is a film that shouldn't be missed. It's a real 50s Indy b&w classic."
3,"ON ""GREASE"" ""KENICKIE"" MADE A REFERENCE TO THIS MOVIE","I HAVE NOT SEEN THIS MOVIE BUT I REMEMBER ""KENICKIE"" (JEFF CONAWAY) MAKING A REFERENCE TO IT ON THE MOVIE ""GREASE"". I DIDN'T KNOW THIS WAS AN ACTUAL MOVIE UNTIL I WAS LOOKING UP OLD ACTORS LIKE JAMES MITCHELL AND JOHN ANTHONY HAYES AND CAME ACROSS IT WHILE READING ABOUT ""JAMES MITCHUM"". I THOUGHT HE WAS ROBERT MITCHUM'S BROTHER. NOW I'VE READ HE WAS HIS SON. I THOUGHT ROBERT MITCHUM WAS A GOOD ACTOR. I ESPECIALLY ENJOYED HIM IN ""CAPE FEAR"". AND FOR EVERYONE WHO ENJOY CHRISTMAS MOVIES, HE STARRED WITH JANET LEIGH IN ""A HOLIDAY AFFAIR"". NOW OUT OF CURIOSITY I WILL BE BUYING ""THUNDER ROAD"" BECAUSE I ENOY SOME OF THOSE OLD DRAG STRIP MOVIES, SUCH AS ""FIREBALL 500"" AND ""THUNDER ALLEY"". ""THUNDER ROAD WAS DEFINITELY A PRECURSOR TO THOSE TWO MOVIES. I'VE BEEN AN AVID COLLECTOR OF MANY OF THOSE OLD MOVIES FOR YEARS. I GUESS I WILL JUST HAVE TO ADD THIS ONE TO MY COLLECTION TOO. I GAVE IT 3 STARS BECAUSE I AM A FAN OF ROBERT MITCHUM."
5,Arrived overnight and works as promised,Have an older DB2 that finally gave up the ghost. Ordered the replacement on a Sunday afternoon (standard shipping) and I was surprised to see it on my doorstep the next day. Install was easy and it's working great.
4,The Shame of the Nation,"If you are a teacher who is interested in how urban schools are being managed, you will definitely like this book. Kozol has done many observations in different school, he shares his thoughts and experiences with the reader."
1,Slanted liberal diatribe,"This is a typical slanted liberal diatribe against the Bush administration and conservatives in general. It has been shown time and again that funding is not the key determinator of how students achieve. Washington DC schools have some of the highest funding in the USA and yet the schools are terrible. Its liberals like him with their allies in the teachers unions who prevent vouchers, charter schools and other inovative ideas that are the real cause of problems."
5,Kozol aptly describes schools for impoverished youth,"Kozol aptly describes schools in Kern County, California. He says ""a state of nearly absolute apartheid now prevails in thousands of our schools."" He says ""a protomilitary form of discipline has now emerged, modeled on stick-and-carrot methods of behavioral control traditionally used in prisons."" He says that liberal education in our inner-city schools has been increasingly replaced by culturally barren and robotic methods of instruction that would be rejected out of hand by schools that serve the mainstream of society."" Kozol has got it right, not just for inner-city schools, but schools where a high proportion of the students quality for free or reduced price meals. Louis Wildman, Professor of Educational Administration, California State University--Bakersfield"
3,Did not like,"I've been doing dancing for years, yet did not care for this video. I found it too hard to follow. Also, you need alot of space to workout."
2,Not for beginners!,"Although this viedo got my heart rate up in no time, there was almost no explaination of the dance steps she was doing and the filming wasn't clear enough to really tell what they were doing either. I can tell it will take a long time before I figure this one out."
1,Couldn't do it,"Okay so I think if a certain routine on a DVD requires the person buying it to have a specific item (let's say hand weights or a floor mat), that would be clearly advertised, right? Nope. I bought this because I always loved Paula Abdul's dance routines from the 80's and thought it would be fun. I put the DVD in only to be told I had to do the workouts on a hard floor. Um wow, could you not have mentioned that somewhere in the description? I have carpet in my den which is the only room with a TV that I can work out in. The moves don't work on carpet and you also need more room to move around (something else that's not mentioned) than what I had. Since I didn't actually get through this workout, I can't rate it on that per se, but I was disappointed that I wasted money for something I can't even do."
2,"Very difficult, slightly rewarding","The moves in this are great, but I did this with several fairly coordinated family members and it was very difficult. I never have managed to master it. She makes a passing attempt at teaching you the moves, but a couple of times she actually completely skips teaching you the move and just does it at the speed of light and expects you to get it (the ""charleston"" is an example of this.) It was freggin sadistic. I'd rather have an impossibly difficult video with good moves than an unbearably easy video, however, so it gets two stars. If you pick up stuff fast and easily, this would probably be a good investment."
4,Fun workout.,"This video is for beginner and intermediate levels. The choreography is harder, but if you do the tape a couple of times it will become easier. It starts with a warmup and is followed by a cardio section with six little dance routines. It then has a toning section that focuses on the thighs and a stretch/cooldown. The dances are taught at a slower tempo and after you learn one dance, you put it together with the previous dance, building up to the final routine. There's a little box in the right hand corning showing the foot work to guide you through. Has basic exercise video music. It's a fun video, although if you do it too much it could become too easy and you may be board when the dances are being tought half tempo. I prefer her get up and dance video over this one. Get Up and Dance is a little higher impact and moves faster. Still, this is a fun video to add to your collection."
4,"Hard but, Fun","This Cardio Dance workout will get you sweating. It's challenging to learn the dance steps but, if it were easy, you'd get bored and stop using it. At first, i thought Paula was crazy and still think it's unrealistic to expect people to get it the first time through. Or even by the 5th or 6th time. But, I also realized that I enjoy the challenge, get a great all body workout and don't even notice how much time has gone by. At first I even went back to try and get the steps a few times and spent an nearly hour on this routine. I had a great workout when I was done but, didn't ever feel like I was working out when I was dancing.Have patience.The workout is set up with moves Paula is famous for and begins slow, then works up to tempo. Don't worry about doing it perfectly the first few times. Just keep moving and you'll get better and better over time.Just have fun."
2,You'd have to be a professioanal dancer to keep up!!!!,"I would love to be able to dance like Paula, but not a chance without a class to learn what all her technical terms mean. If you have some dance experience (apart from when you were a little kid) and are very fit - this is a great workout for you. If you are looking for a DVD to help you get into shape - you better find something else - this is way too advanced. She goes through the moves too fast and you don't have time to learn them before she moves on to something else."
3,Good dancing - if you can keep up!,"The dance moves on this video are fun, but were a little difficult to follow the first time. I had to rewind a number of times to catch on, and I'm not a TERRIBLE dancer, I don't think. She doesn't really build one move onto the next, as with the classes and other videos I've seen, which makes piecing it all together at the end a little more challenging. I did get my heartrate up though, and that's what counts. I also had fun doing it! She does provide an excellent, if short, lower body workout at the end of the tape. You definitely need some room to do this video. I had a 12' x 12' cleared space and that was a little too small to freely do all the moves."
4,very good,"Good album, semi-typical. Suffers from somewhat inane subject matter, but with some decent lyrics."
4,Not the best,THE MAZE OF THE BEAST was not the best DELTORA QUEST. It was slightly boring compared to the others. It seemed like the best bit was the boat bit.
1,Bad vinyl,Does not play. These were mismanufactured. 3rd one I know of that was made incorrectly. Do not buy this vinyl.
5,UNEXPLAINABLE,"Im a fairly new sublime fan but this record is by far the best i've ever heard. once you put it in your cd player, you cant take it out. its addicting. every song on this cd is totally awesome. brads voice is the most pure voice i've ever heard and the variation of their music is genius. the fact that brad died brings tears to my eyes- thinking of how big they could've been, let alone seeing the impact they already made on punk & ska music. overall- this is the best record youll ever buy-hands down. i suggest you go buy this, and every other sublime record you can get your hands on, because these guys made the best music youll ever find."
5,AWESOME THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY,"Ok ok where do I start. The lyrics, beats and just the whole cd is off the hook. I absolutly love 'Caress Me Down','Santeria', and 'Wrong Way'. My friend let me borrow her cd for a day and by the end of the day i was hooked and didn't want to give it back. Brad your music is awesome, I love you and R.I.P. All of you better get off of your butts and get it! Sublime forever!"
5,this cd is the greatest!,"sublime is one of the greatest bands of all time, and they proved with this album!!!........they have an awesome rap sound, but u can actually understand what theyre saying!!!.....they sound kind of like a mix between rap and reggae, which is very cool!!"
5,this cd is great buy it. Brad we love you and miss you R.I.P,you must buy this cd .if you only get one sublime cd then make this one it.brad hope your enjoying heaven.
5,GREAT,"This is my favorite cd. Whether your are a sublime fan or if you just heard a song on the radio, you must get this. This cd is not as good as 40 oz. to freedom or robbin the hood, but still this is very good. I wish Brad didn't die, then sublime would still be the best band ever. R.I.P."
4,This cd is a must get,"This is great cd and I can listein to it over and over again!! Get it, it's a must get cd!! What I got is my personal favourite!"
4,Giant Ball,This is a total hit with both young and old. We love it. The ball needs to be patched more than I would have hoped... but it is a great yard game!
3,GayBuddhistLawyer,"While this has a lot to recommend it, the author seems to be excessively politically correct. It would seem that she has no familiarity with mainstream economic analysis, but is perhaps overly familiar with Marxist economics. She seems to feel that value is only created by farmers/laborers and needs to remind of it. Her many boxed digressions are interesting, but the one on Hinduism and Buddhism is so strange, that it did make me question the validity of her work in areas I'm less familiar with. She says that the Dutch did not try to convert the Islamic, Hindu or Buddhist Indonesians because they regarded Asians as essentially different (inferentially a racist outlook). I would like to know her source for this, since the pragmatic observation that there were far too many of them and they were too attached to their religions to make forced conversion possible seems like a much more obvious reason for the decision."
1,Too big for Brother CS600i,"I bought this case to protect my new Brother CS600i sewing machine, but the case a few inches too large on every side! Also, the case has the look and feel of aged plastic."
2,I would not buy this again,"Really offers limited protection over a cardboard box. In fact, the box that the swing machine shipped in would offer more protection.The box is poorly constructed and takes up extra space."
1,Two machines could have fit,"I received this case as a Christmas gift and was surprised to find how huge it was. I have a Brother XL- 3750 and two machines could have fit in the case. More damage would have been done to the machine by banging around in the case than out of it. I returned it. I was also shocked to see the piece of metal that held the handle in place on the inside of the lid was rusted and it was supposed to be brand new. Too bad, but much too bulky."
3,Brother Sewing Machine Case,It is a good price the only drawback was it was too large for the sewing machine even though in the description it said it was the proper size. I was able to adapt it to the machine we have. GOOD BUY!!!
2,Very cheap and damaged,The product seems to have been used. There are black scratches on the case. It is a cheap case that hold the sewing machine.
4,GREAT HELP,The case is a bit big and uneven when carrying it but the machine is covered and protected. It will definintly fit most machines out there and is light weight. Great Deal!
3,Sewing machine carrying case,I expected there would be a pocket or box for foot pedal electric wire storage inside the carrying case for transporting the machine.
3,OK case if you're willing to finish manufacturing it,"This case arrived in good condition, but was deformed when manufactured. The bottom bowed downward in the center about 3/4 inch and rocked back and forth on the floor. My wife asked me to make a close-fitting base for her Brother model 1034D serger. I cut a piece of plywood and two 2x2x4 inch bumpers from 2x2 wood. I covered all with thick felt and fastened the base to the floor of the case with one bolt in the center. The internal base holds the serger in place and also flattens the floor of the case. IF YOU'RE NOT HANDY WITH FIXING DEFORMED PLASTIC PRODUCTS, I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS CASE. I'M ALSO SORRY TO SAY THAT THIS CASE IS MADE IN THE US... QUALITY CONTROL ON THIS PRODUCT LEAVES MUCH TO BE DESIRED."
3,not completely what i expected.,even though i knew that this was a universal case before i bought it and of course did not imagine that it would fit my machine perfectly i did not expect for my machine to move around so much in this case. the machine can get kind of banged up if you simply walk with the case so you have to be really careful. i have actually started to put in cushioning like clothing and rags and other things to hold the machine in place. the case is very well and you can tell it is great quality. the only problem is that there is no way of locking your machine into one spot in this case.
1,"What a disappointment, don't bother...",This is a bad purchase. It is warped on the long sides. I was not able to bend it to clamp it together. Very bad quality and I will never consider a carrier from these folks again. If I could give it 'No' star I would. It was a waste of my time researching it and in having to return the item.
2,Too much rock not enough Billy...,"This CD was just to much like punk and rock, not enough of the psychobilly sound, just no soul for lack of a better word. They have played in other bands, and have musical talent, but hope on there next CD they can make it from the gut , and less commercial sounding. I saw on u tube they are working hard, touring in a small van."
2,Cory Parks,Just wanted to check out cory's new band. i am not into the hollywood rockabilly thing. if you like stuff from the horror pops and the such if not wast your money on something else
2,poor packaging,"I ordered 5 cases of nails.When I unpacked them, all coils were smashed flat.The packaging for these nails are the poorest I've seen.I've always used Bostitch nails in past , with never a problem.As a busy contractor, the last thing I want to do is have to rewind every coil before use.They really need to go to a stronger box, or ship inside a cardboard tube.jerry CostaCayman Islandsand USA"
3,"Scans, but somewhat ineffecient to transfer to DB mgmt software","The CardScan does capture fields fairly well though it may make mistakes on about 4 or 5 cards of 10 - you must verify each cards info after it is input (not a big deal).My problem comes from the softwares inability to flag the newly inputted contacts for follow up - when I export/transfer them to my ACT! 2005 Database, I can't seperate them instantly from newly inputted cars and have to hunt them down - no big deal, but I find it's easier just ot input the data seperately anyway.HTHs. JOE"
2,Don't bother,"I received this watch as a gift some years back and was almost instantly disappointed with it. A week into ownership the movement froze and ceased functioning after a long walk in the snow. Later, the whole crown came out completely. The watch was replaced under warrantee (but it took nearly three months to receive a new one), but a year or so later it happened again when the watch was out of warrantee.Ultimately, I was really disappointed by the workmanship of this product. There are certainly much better watches out there for the price."
5,BILTMORE IS NOT THE ONLY CASTLE,"LIVING IN THE SHADOW AND SPELL OF BILTMORE, IMAGINE MY SURPRISE AT FINDING BILTMORE BUT ONE OF MANY FINE HOUSES BUILT BY THIS GREEDY FAMILY IN SEARCH OF EXTRAVAGANCE, SAFETY AND MODERN CONVENIENCE. THE INFORMATION PRESENTED SHEDS A WHOLE NEW LIGHT ON THE VANDERBILT FAMILY AND THEIR INDIVIDUAL LIVES, REVEALING NOT ONLY THE INDIVIDUAL STYLES OF THE HOMES BUT OF THEIR CAUSES AND CRUSADES AND UNBELIEVABLE SHENANIGANS. I WORE OUT THE ROAD TO THE LIBRARY AND NEARLY WENT BROKE PAYING FINES UNTIL I LEARNED I COULD OWN THIS BOOK THAT HAS CHANGED MY THOUGHTS ABOUT OUR LOCAL ""CASTLE."" WE STILL LOVE BILTMORE - WE STILL ABHOR THE GREED OF THIS FAMILY THAT THOUGHT NOTHING OF STRANDING RAILROAD PASSENGERS IN THE SNOW. JUST AS WE CAN'T WAIT TO VISIT ASHEVILLE AGAIN, WE CAN'T WAIT TO READ THIS FASCINATING ACCOUNT AGAIN!!"
5,The Kids Love It!,My Kids absolutly love playing this and a great source of entertainment went they have friends over. Sometimmes they sing badly just to hear Randy and Simon giving them bad reviews.
3,Not sure,"I don't actually use these books myself, I get them for my customers in the computer shop. Have had good luck with the TYV Windows XP book. But I haven't sold any of these Vista ones yet, because I don't recommend Vista to my customers. So I don't know how good it is or not. So I'll give it an ""average"" rating for now."
4,"Atlantis, AKA The Garden of Eden number 1","I came to this book through The Urantia Book. A great contribution to the continuing saga of our civilization's evolution. Thanks, Robert."
2,"Many theories, little reality!",The theory behind the book is very good ... shame that could not be demonstrated in the reality due of the fiasco when they tried to find Atlantis on the bottom of the coasts of Cyprus.
1,Commercial imagination repackaged,"Yet another book twisting imagination with presumably commercial intent. If you believe Atlantis was 5 million years ago ... dream on. In my opinion, another waste of paper not to praise. Yes, I do buy these books, to save others their valuable time."
5,Terrific Clay Pot Baker - Unique Flavor Meal in ONE Vessel,"Moist, Juicy, Tender and Very Flavorful. This clay pot baker is perfect to two people cooking in just one pot. We have cooked Beef, Chicken, Shrimp, Veggies and more, and each one maintains its unique flavor which is heightened by the clay pot magic. We use basic recipes found in clay pot cooking books, add a twist or two after we used it a few times, and WAM! A face full of flavor and everything is cooked just right. once you try cooking this way, you will do it once or twice a week. It's easy, and tastes better & fresher than many other ways."
3,Another zap them game.,Good guys have to beat the bad guys. Alot of fluff not much body but it make them happy.
3,Great poster. Wasn't exact dimensions.,"I bought this poster for my office from my business' Amazon account. The poster looks great. We were very excited. However, it wasn't the dimensions advertised after we bought a 24x36 frame at Target. After finding a frame with the dimensions of 24x34, the poster fit perfectly. So unless you plan to matte the sides of the poster one inch on each side, keep a look out on that scenario."
1,DO NOT BUY IT !,The title of my review says it all. Just do not buy it. I do not believe that NMS published a book like this. Poor examples and poor explanations. Whatever this book says it is common sense ... DO NOT BUY IT. I will buy the other one. (...)
1,The last thing Zelazny would ever want,"Just to prevent people from being misled by the positive comments ofthe readers here, and by the editorial review, this book is not in any way approved by Zelazny, despite what the cover says.Zelazny was very strongly opposed to this book ever being written and time and time again stated that he didn't want anyone writing any books for Amber. It wasn't until after his death that they felt they could do this becuase he was no longer around to complain.I find that vulgarly offensive to his memory and feel that anyone who buys this book is insulting Zelazny."
2,Going from bad to awful.,"The WRITING STYLE of these books would have killed even a much better plot and much more interesting characters. This is simply bad prose, clumsily written and ineptly edited. Stilted language and unimaginative settings make the flat, unengaging characters and the meandering story line even worse than they could have been. The 2nd book out of three is somewhat better than the first one and gave me hope that Betancourt was finally learning how to write. It even encouraged me to reread the original two Amber series. But Betancourt's third book was a disaster! It was difficult to finish. The language was even more stilted than in the first book, while the story and the characters lost any depth and luster they seemed to start developing in the second book. Don't waste your time or money."
1,Waste of Money and a Weekend!,Try more like a month! This book overpromises and is written in too confusing a manner to follow. I would have gotten further just reading my electronics manual.
3,Slick deal,"Haven't used it yet, but I like the weight and feel of the fabric and believe it will work well to protect my cards and cash while traveling."
2,Nice at First,"The great thing about this money belt is that it is designed to hold a passport in addition to credit cards and cash. The problem is, being made of silk, it wears very easily with frequent use. I would suggest finding an item designed like this but made of a more durable fabric."
5,survived through my trip!,We wore these for two weeks in Mexico. Some of my friends got their bags stolen during their trips so I thought this would be necessary to keep my belongings safe while taking care of my children. This money belt is the perfect size for adults to keep items safe. It is lightweight and durable. I got them very sweaty each day and they dried out each night with no odor.
2,Not good for wearing on hot days,"I used this product during a trip to India. The belt provided is too long. I had to have the excess belt rolled up and this made it rather uncomfortable. The bigger issue however is that there is a plastic liner but it is not sealed so this is not an ideal product for hot days - many of which I encountered in India. Having the belt so close to your body means that sweat will get on the product. I thought the plastic liner would protect the money and passport copies I had place in it but was surprised to find that since the liner is not sealed (ie, zip lock or some other enclosure) excessive sweat will get inside the liner. After a few days of finding soaked money and copies, I stopped using the product."
2,Late Shipment,I can't speak to the quality of the product. But I needed it rushed for my trip out of the country. I paid extra money to get it the next day. It hasn't showed up 3 days later. Not good.
4,A Comfortable Money Belt With A Small Flaw,"After purchasing the money belt, I used it during a 10-day trip to France and Germany. Overall, it was very comfortable to use under my clothing and easily held my passport, cash and credit cards. My only criticism is that the clip which locks the belt around the waist is fragile and made of plastic. While mine did not break, the quality could have been better. Otherwise, I recommend the money belt."
4,Money Belt,"The money belt was comfortable, but the plastic holder for the passport became wrinkled and crinkled so it no longer lay smoothly inside the pocket. The next trip we take I will just put a plastic bag around the passport instead of using the enclosed plastic holder. Other than that, it was great."
5,Excellent product,High quality money belt that is very comfortable to wear and easy to access. My husband and I each wore one on a recent trip to Europe and all of our important items were very secure. Would recommend this item to all.
1,I should have never bought it,"First off, I have to say that money belts are just not for me. I felt awkward wearing it.The strap is too long, but I adjusted it, cut the ""tail"" off, and pinned the end with a safety pin to keep everything in place. But the damn thing just won't stay put. I wanted it to my little secret bellow the belt, but it kept riding up to my belly. When it has too much money in it, or just a passport, it makes me look lumpy. So the point of having a money belt is negated, because everyone can see that I'm wearing one!I ended up just putting my extra cash in a hidden pocket on the inside of my jacket.Sorry Rick Steves. I still love the show though."
4,Great Money Belt!,"Bought this for a recent trip to New Orleans due to pickpockets/muggings in the French Quarter. Very soft and lightweight silk. The strap is stretchy, so when you set it to your size, it doesn't dig in. The strap is very long, so it could be worn by people of many sizes. If you're a smaller person, you may have to alter the strap so it doesn't hang down. You do sweat wearing it, but it dries out fast. The plastic sleeve insert kept my money completely dry, and the belt was undetectable under my pants."
2,Didn't survive an eight day trip to Europe,"I purchased this item and used it just last week for my trip to Europe. It lasted only three days before the zippers failed. We used Rick Steves' books and audio guides and loved those but this money belt was not built to last. I found that as long as you don't wear baggy pants or shorts, you can get away with keeping your valuables in your front pockets without any problems. If you think you still need a money belt you should try something a little more durable (and probably more expensive)."
5,"Comfortable, good size","After losing all of my valuables & passport to a Paris subway pickpocket a few years ago, I decided to get something to help me hide my stuff better. I can wear this money belt 12 straight hours and never feel it. And because I travel to hot places and I sweat profusely on my chest, I appreciate that this is made of silk and doesn't seem to cause undue extra perspiration."
3,good,Works fine. Good to have. I will use it again and again when going on vacation to different areas so I don't have to worry about carrying a pocketbook.
5,Blue Feather,The Navajo legend is very dramatic and poignant. I recommend this book to anyone who loves the Southwest and is interested in the Anasazi cliff dwellings.
2,Funky Fashion Makeover Heads Aren't Very Durable!!!,"I bought Funky Fashion Makeover Cloe and on the first day of playing with her, i found myself practically covered with strands of blonde hair. I was not pulling her hair, twisting it, or doing anything to it that could make it fall out, just braiding it.So there was a funny-looking (and nearly bald) Cloe. I asked the store if i could return it and get another one. So i did that and got Sasha.I opened her very carefully and took out her accessories. i put a clip in her hair, the clip broke, and i put another one in. That broke too.Then, when my sister was putting lip gloss on Sasha, the lip paint became flaky and most of it came off.These makeover heads aren't durable, especially if things like this are happening on the first day of purchase. All i can say is i'm never buying another one and they are a total rip-off."
3,Hollywood better stop while their ahead with direct-to-video sequels,"Wild Things 2 (2004) Susan Ward, Leila Arcieri, Isaiah Washington, Joe Michael Burke, D: Jack Perez. Interminably unconvincing in-name-only sequel to the original ""Wild Things"", with no relation, rewrites the same endless twists. Two sworm high-school enemies double cross each other in a plan that begins with the loss of an inheritance and things only get fisher. This carbon copy goes through the paces, with plot turns you see coming from a mile away and only get dumber and dumber; you're not likely to care about anything except maybe Wards tan lines. Advice: skip this and rent the original. Running Time: 93 minutes and rated R for sexual contant, nudity, violence, and language. * 1/2"
5,Great Camera,I bought this camera around 2 years ago and I am still very happy with it! It takes great pictures consistently both close up and far. Surprisingly I also really like the Kodak Easyshare software that comes with the camera for minor changes to the picture. I have found this to be one of the best digital camera's I have seen.The only con to me is that it does have a tendency to suck batteries dry fairly quickly.
2,Disappointed,"I've been reading the other reviews of this camera and honestly I don't know where all the praise is coming from. When you view photos on the computer it is very misleading because they look fine. Once they are developed you will notice that the pictures come out blurry and the color is off. Some colors are so bright it just doesn't look right. Secondly, the developed photo covers a smaller area than the computer photo. For me I think the picture is centered until it is developed and I notice someone's head is cut off or something. Again, it looked fine on the computer. Red-eye galore, and the date stamp is huge and a distraction to the picture. Needless to say, I am disappointed."
3,"good first cmera, bad after","for a young persons first digital camera, this is okbut I've had this camera for a bit over a year, and I grew out of it very quickly. It was my first digital camera that was all mine, but I was extremely dissapointed. The image quailty is typically really bad, and it preforms bad in low light. The flash tends to make the pictures look bad. I also find it chunky compared to so many of the other compact digital cameras out there.Pros:good first camera, extremely easy to oporateCons:poor image quality (with and without flash), very few manual options, chunky for the type of camera it is, few megapixelsI advise you not to buy this camera, unless you're a young (child) first time users.look into canons, they're pretty simple, and much much better."
3,Quite different...,"Well, firstly, this movie is FAR from the gothic, Johnny Depp film. Not one moment of gore in the entire feature, which makes it on the whole an enjoyable family flick, although an obvious British, low budget production.Still recommended, though..."
5,For more pleasure,"I now own all three of these Female masturbation DVDs. I recommend viewing any of them with the Deliberate Orgasm Duet.These women when masturbating used the technique of the deliberate orgasm shown in details and explained in the Duet. The Duet shows a man ""doing"" a woman, giving her an orgasm by touching her with his hands and explaining how to expand the sensation and making it better and better. Without having seen the duet first, as I said I don't know if I would have gotten it or appreciated it.The orgasm is very different from anything I have ever seen, simple, quiet, but I must say works great upon experimenting with it."
1,Pathetic. Stopped working after second try,"I am returning this unit to Amazon. Don't buy it. It is cheap, looks cheap and doesn't work. I bought the Generic Ericsson charger that Best Buy sells instead. It is the complete opposite of this product."
2,Stinks,"Too strong of a smell for me. Does not repel fleas, in case anybody else was interested in it for that purpose."
2,Trying To Like Mendelssohn,"I have never been very fond of Mendelssohm's compositions. This recording does not help my vague impressions. It is not a very good recording- inconsistent sound (I had to keep changing the volume throughout). As usual with Mendelssohn, I kept falling asleep. It sounded better after a second hearing, but not enough for me to recommend it.A bargain record, but not really a bargain."
3,Like boyhood tales from your favorite uncle,"""Out of the Shelter"" is a gentle story written with a spirit of generosity. I think Lodge has some affection for all his characters, even his villains. Reading this book feels like hearing your favourite uncle telling stories of his boyhood.For all this, it certainly isn't Lodge's best book. (It originally came out in 1970, his third book.) Bits feel clumsy, lacking in confidence - sometimes there's a bit too much explanation of characters' motivation and transitions between scenes can be jarring. The narration is peculiar in places, as if it was originally written in the first person and then quickly rewritten with an omniscient narrator.I'd still recommend the book.Further recommendations: If you're looking to read your first book by Lodge, try `Changing Places'. If you already love Lodge, this is a great way to continue the affair. You might also like books by Alison Lurie and Wallace Stegner."
4,I love Sabrina the Teenage Witch tv show!,"I don't know about everyone else, but I would like to see Sabrina the Teenage Witch series released on DVD, and not just the pilot movie. The pilot movie is okay because it does set up the show, but the characters (actors) are completely different in the series. I really love this tv show. It is the kind of show you can watch over and over and still enjoy it. There is just a sweet wholesomeness to it. Near the end of the series, the program lost some it's strength by getting rid of the aunts and introducing Sabrina's weird housemates, but at the very end the producers remembered what was important and brought all of the players back. (except for Libby -- how great would that have been?)"
3,good information,"A little over a week after finishing the two volume series, a woman I chose sent her phone number over to me while I was pumping gas. The information is useful but not earth shattering and at least the price is not the ridiculous amount some internet publishers charge."
4,good book for dating,"This book tells the reader about what to expect from women from different age groups. He reveals the mindset of each of them, and how to deal with them. He tells you how to dress to attract the girl, and what and what not to do, and how to behave properly. He is very informative. This is a great book for people of all ages. You should read this book, which will help you out very much. You will find out how to deal with women. You will learn from his mistakes, instead of going through what he went through. This is a good buy. Listen to what he says and you will be very thankful."
5,I've read all the other books; this one works!,"Don Steele is the first author of a ""HOW TO"" dating book that really works. How do I know? Well I read this book and his book on body language (also excellent) and for the first time in my life I am meeting women other than in dating services. I am now meeting women in book stores and at work and it's very exciting. This works because Don teaches you how to do it with SENSITIVITY to what the woman is telling you nonverbally and verbally. I have read all the dating books that I could find and none really helped me. Don is different, he knows what he's talking about because he has done it. He is also very good at explaining how to do it. His treatment is global enough to allow the reader to assimilate the information and use it based on their own personality and circumstance. If you want to learn how to live and feel the real excitement that life has to offer read this book!"
3,How to date young women for men over 35,"BEFORE reading HTDYW Vol 1, I always to the NICE things.NOW I am starting to see success, with first or coffee dates by following some rules: talk obliquely, relaxed and demonstrate that I am ONLY slightly interested. NICE does not work. Thanks to Don, the author of the book by writing this. Hear him at his radio show at live 365."
1,this book is a failure and doesnt work LA Fittness Killer,Hmm lets see this book was used extensively by the schizoid mass murderer George Sordini inpittsburgh. Who stated he had not slept with a women in 19 years. Doesnt work. dont buy it.
2,Derivative yet nuanced,"HTDYW has illumined moments concerning the male/female dynamic. While poorly written for the inexperienced man there are benefits within. I would caution the reader that Steeles MO is successfull only with women who are inexperienced and lack dynamic self. Very attractive, bright women do not respond to the narcissistic manipulation which his tecnigues employ. Steele is quite jaded and bitter as well...if you assume his view your natural trust in women will be forever changed (and) your paranoid reflex engaged. This book has a pack mentality ,is really for Men uncomfortable with designing their own lives. Steele is NOT the worthy mans guru, by and large, his effort is self serving. After I ""deprogrammed"" myself I started dating/mating a real keeper who would have shown no interest in the cynic I was encouraged to be by Steeles' Books. Be careful NOT to do yourself the ultimate injustice of regarding this book Biblically."
1,All you need is a MC-505 and talk alot of trash and u too,"ca be a star like Peaches. ha ha! If you like [bad] techno beats with Peaches talking trash then this cd is for you. If you want real talent then get Ladytron or Northern Lite. ..., even Warren Suicide does better music than this."
2,"she is a lady, and she is mine!!!","when this lady is an anti pop star ? the songs she plays, surely has nothing to do with the classic masterpiece rock n roll elements...she certainly plays rock songs, but it is definitely not a rock n roll or Heavyrock masterpiece genre!Some veterans legendary heavy rock bands from the past such as Black sabbath, Uriah Heep, King crimson, Led Zeppelin or deep purple should teach her how to play Rock n roll very well!"
5,Great Study Guide,Certainly worth buying if you are looking for a study guide. Refreshing to see a different author associated with Nichiren Daishonin Buddhism.
3,Powdery,"Very, very powdery on me. Not an offensive fragrance, I don't HATE it, but I'm not really liking it either. Whenever I get a whiff, I just think powder. There's some floral notes in this too, but they're pretty nondescript. It smells like the 80s to me- all big hair and stirrup pants and acid washed denim."
3,"Great fragance, BUT... (bottle and fixation issues)","I will explain my self: the perfume is lovely. Deep, sweet, heavy. I really like it.But it wont last long enough. That's why I'm not pleased with the quality/price ratio.And you shouldn't travel with this perfume. You know, when you go to another city, because of the normal and little pressure changes in the air, the bottle reacts: it will lose some perfume. I think the quality of the spray system is not good enough for the fragrance. Same thing with the fixation of it.So, it will smells great in the morning, but there is no more at midday. Not good for purse carrying if traveling."
2,"Yummy, but inconvenient","These Live Savers are yummy but each one is individually wrapped inside the roll. Very inconvenient--especially since the cellophane tends to stick to the candy and you end up spitting out little pieces of plastic. Yummy candy, yucky packaging."
1,Verbose and superficial: a waste of money,"...I bought this book to make plans for a trip to Zambia but the chapter about this country is only 40 pages long, both verbose and superficial. Don't get fooled by the ""Adventuring"" in the title, unless your idea of adventure is to hop by plane from lodge to lodge at $200 or $300 a night. More importantly, except for the park entrance fees, this book doesn't list any price at all (I got them from two other, excellent, travel guides). Comments on cheaper accomodations are few and disenchanted. The maps are equally few and over-simplified (the roads don't even appear!...) Finally, I looked at the chapters about the other countries and it certainly didn't change my opinion about this book. Note also that the date of the last edition (October 97) makes it relatively outdated."
2,only for colecting the actual pack,"ok, i have major issues with ppl buying these packs1. you can get packs waaayyyy cheaper on ebay, and various mtg sites2. you can buy a complete set of fallen empires for 30-40 dollars anyway3. there is not 1 card worth money in this set4. only buy this item if you want to keep the pack unopened"
4,Fat grips,"These dumbbells are A-OK except that the grips, unlike what appears in the picture, are rather wide/fat. I would have liked to get narrower gripped dumbbell for a tighter grasp but I guess I'll get over it. These are well priced..."
2,BIG dissapointment,"Wow i was completely dissapointed when I heard this CD, I was a fan of Ruben when he was on American Idol, and enjoyed his voice. His first CD was a bit of a let-down, but now this one is worse. Please download a sample of his song and see how bad it is before u buy it. Dont waste your money like I did, this might be why this is only #600 in the amazon sales rank, and this CD just debuted..."
4,VERY GOOD OFFERING FROM A TRUE TALENT!!,"This CD has improved totally from ""Soulful"" which the producers did not have the insight to showcase Ruben's talent adequately. All the songs here are inspiring and indeed, edifying. I only hope Studdard's producers continue in the same vein for the next one!! This CD is well worth the money!!"
4,"Phenomenal, inspirational, moving album!","Ruben Studdard made a very dynamic album in I Need An Angel. It's very much a gospel album, but very inspirational and universal in its themes. It has a few mainstream touches within it, but the spiritual veins are still kept in them. He is very much at home with this genre than the mostly R&B album Soulful last year. I have heard many of these songs more than once. He can sure be testifying it on Fix It Jesus! He does get to do songs with his favorite artists in Fred Hammond, Eric Dawkins, Mary Mary, and Harvey Watkins. Warryn Campbell, Eric Dawkins, Derek Clark R. Kelly, Fred Hammond, Ruben, Lauren Thomas, and Alvin Garrett produced some wonderful music for this album. This will be just as well received as Kirk Franklin's hit gospel albums in the '90s. Ruben will win some Stellar and Dove awards for this one--this is so very well done!"
3,"Ancient Chinese Secret ? Treasure Chest, My Aunt Mimi!","This kit comes from a series that includes ""Ancient Egypt"", ""Ancient Greece"", ""Ancient Rome"", ""Ancient Sock Drawer"". You are much better off going to a Chinese Grocery Store or an actual Chinese person for the same information. The Trinkets (I-Ching Coins and ink/brush combo) are nice, but with the proliferation of Chinese Astrology Kits and Chinese Ink Painting Kits (Damn you, Klutz Press, what have you Wrought??), you do get more by buying the extra trinkets separately. No synergism here folks, just a handy cardboard treasure chest of Asian Exotica. Yeah right. I also bought 500 Army Men for $1.98. Buy it if you want, just don't get your hopes up!"
3,"Oh, I so wish I could give this a better review.","I've previously (and very successfully) learned Spanish using the Pimsleur CDs, so when I was planning a trip to Copenhagen to visit a friend, I was happy to get a hold of the Pimsleur Danish CDs.Unfortunately, while the Pimsleur method is by far the most effective I've found for learning to speak a language (as opposed to reading it), the execution of the Pimsleur Danish is CD is substandard. The dialogues are not of the same quality of those used in the Spanish lessons, and the male speaker has a markedly Swedish, not Danish accent.If you do try to use these to augment your Danish instruction, model your responses on the female speaker, not the male. My friend in Copenhagen is still teasing me about my Swedish accent.One of my friends at work, who is married to a Dane, recommends Colloquial Danish as the best Danish instruction CD/book combo she's been able to find. That's where I'll be headed next..."
3,20's music,"This CD has great 20's music. Some were not great hits, but others were in the top charts."
5,"You wanna write, or do you wanna read the instructions?","After trying out a couple demos for the leading formatting software, I couldn't stop working on Screenwriter. It was so easy to use, and fun, I ended up writing a 40 page script on the demo. The other demos demanded I spend the time learning the software before I was able to start writing, what a bother!Screenwriter frees you up to let the ideas flow, it's like having a secretary who thinks you are so brilliant he will take care of all the annoying details for you and even predict what your thinking. Screenwriter will also rib you about procrastinating if you wonder off to play with the preferences.I love choosing the actors to read my script out loud, and the storyboard feature.Defiantly the software to get if you want to enjoy writing."
2,Made of SUCK.,Difficult to inflate. The bottom tore out. Never could use it properly. Would not buy again. BLEAH.
3,Those wonderful women in their flying machines: a story of perseverence and courage over mysoginism.,"I found the book easy and agreable to read, being split in chapters covering various aspects of the story of the WASPs. The book showed well the depth of the prejudice and intolerance, sometimes bordering on the criminal, shown towards brave women who only wanted to serve their country in a time of war. The autor also managed to cover the subject of aviation without using overly technical terms. The only possible critique I would give to this book is that more pictures may have made the book even easier to read, especially to the readers who have little or no knowledge of aviation. I am myself highly knowledgeable about aviation and war and found the information in the book to be both accurate and pertinent to the subject of the book. Overall a good book to have to relax or pass time during a long trip."
5,Loved it,A very simple eating plan with great simple foods that work to aide in your weigh loss program. This author has other great recipe books also
1,Not even in the ballpark,This book doesn't even come close to being creative. Pop around on a few free websites and save yourself some $.
1,Big Bummer,"I cook healthy all the time and just got this book as a gift...I'm so unimpressed. I'd seen Ellie's show on the Food Network a couple of times then stopped watching because the stuff she makes is still fattening if you're trying to stay in shape. Sure it has healthy fats, blah, blah, but that doesn't keep you in shape. I'd be a bit forgiving if the stuff actually tasted great, but it's mediocre at best. The book is no different. And she's not even fun to watch like Rachel or Giada. I have a pile of healthy cookbooks and diet books this one is definitely my least favorite."
3,Average textbook,"Too verbose. You will find yourself searching for important information in paragraphs of useless words. On the other hand, the text is very easy to read."
2,Only an introduction to biomechanics,"I am a grad student in biology who recently got interested in spider silk biomechanics. I was looking for a good book on biomechanics and my advisor suggested that I get this one. It was so disappointing !The coverage of the various topics is quite superficial. The chapter on biological materials is especially disappointing to me : since I already knew what were 'stress', 'strain' and 'Young's modulus', I didn't learn anything. I guess you can learn as much by just surfing the web -- and that's for free.I also think the book lacks equations and formulae. You can go through 10 pages without seeing any equations -- just text. Maybe 'equations' does not mean 'scientific rigor', but I can't help prefering a good old equation to lines and lines of text.Maybe I was expecting too much from this book. So okay, if you are a biologist, don't like maths and have never heard of biomechanics, you may enjoy that book. But you have to be aware that it is REALLY an introduction."
2,NOT SATISFIED with thisTweezerman product ...,"Being a Tweezerman product I thought this would work well. It combs your brows but it does nothing to hold them up and in place, and worst of all it doesn't tame brows down. Very disapointing."
2,More of the same.....,"Yet another session of five minute drone pieces. Nice enough were they few and far between...say, b-sides to a single, but every Jesu release is basically sounding too similar these days. Built up layered semi-instrumental tracks get old if they all basically sound the same, and they do, if only in feel if not sound. Its just really getting old. I yearn for the surprises Justin delivered in the past."
2,Didn't love them,"I usually love all tweezerman products, but these need to be retooled (heheh pun intended). They are too thick and are hard to control. My nails come out cut slanted, even when I'm cutting with my dominant hand. I own tweezerman's toenail scissors and think they are great, but the toenail scissors cut my fingernails better than this product."
2,Bad Attempt To Honor Operation Ivy,"Most of this album sounds downright bad in their weak attempts to cover Operation Ivy with a new spin. ITs not really a bad idea or anything, it just didn't work here with these artists. A couple bands are okay on this album, but for the most part the selection is awful. By the way where is Telegraph's version of Unity?"
1,total total complete garbage,"listen to me. listen to me. this album is the worst worst worst album ever. what a complete total wrong thing to do to one of the best bands ever. I love op ivy like everyone else, from back on the h street videos, and it would be great to hear more from them. however, this is not it. what's the best band on here? blue meanies. they are so good in their own right, but still have no business demolishing yellin in my ear. bad town? give me a break. just kill me now. does punk rock really does suck this much now that bad town (total classic) gets destroyed by those idiots? cherry poppin daddies? weak as hell. aquabats - corny. in fact, now I'm pissed. buy this album and you're a total fool.by the way, most tribute albums suck. but I would imagine that almost every other one in the whole world rocks this pile of crap."
4,Great c.d. If you like the song!,"The first song is quite exhilerating.If you like U2, you should like the c.d.It's not a must have...but it is a good listen."
3,Simply simplified,This book is definitely for the beginner. I found it way too simplified for anyone that has a good working knowledge of Windows XP.
3,Solid Book,"Used this book as a complementary book for an Independent Study course in BYU for writing 212. Solid book, it's extensive yet not wordy. Very good poetry and backgrounds. I'd recommend it."
1,Junk!,I received one of these for a gift. The first button fell off on the second day I used the watch. After a seven week wait to get a new watch fixed the second button fell off in about two weeks. I demanded and received a refund.
2,No good service,"I received one of these as a gift. As mentioned in the above review one of the button fell off. I observed this only after 5 months. I tried taking it to an Authorized TISSOT Service center. But since i had got this from Amazon the warranty was void. When i contacted Amazon they said since this watch was sold by a third party vendor ""Watch Savings"", i had to contact them for warranty. When i contacted the vendor they say their warranty covers only internal repairs. Now i have to spend on my own to get it repaired even after having a 2 year warranty on the watch...."
1,As bad as it gets........,"This is just a horrible cd. I have no idea why some of these reviews actually liked it. To even think that it is Jimmy Buffet quality is insane! The audio quality is the worst I've ever had the misfortune to hear. Songs are dreadful, and the guy couldn't carry a tune in a bucket. I should be shot for buying it-that bad.Rick"
2,slow,incredibly slow movie; I almost could not finish watching it. one of the most boring movies I have watched in my entire 48 1/2 years.
5,looking forward to yet another day!,"i look forward to getting to the office a little early, tearing off yesterday's sheet, reading today's calendar sheet, and laughing out loud. i use the old sheets to write notes for colleagues (instead of stick-it notes), which usually are apropros to the office goings on that day. i love adams' creativity - the ironies and utter stupidity are something that we all can really relate to at work! for the amount of laughter that this calendar has given me and my colleagues, it was well worth the price and i'm destined to purchase it again next year!"
5,The Storm of the Texas Tyrants,"AAAHHH! Absu comes raging forth with ""Third Storm"", a blasted requiem for the green shores of celtic homelands. Highlights of this release include, ""Highland Tyrant Attack"" and the black thrash anthem ""Swords and Leather"" (""LEATHER!! SHIIING!!""). This album is definitely speedier and leaner than the previous outings and it delivers the goods with flailing guitars along with the incomparably reptilian black metal shriek and flying percussion of vocalist/drum warrior extraordinare Proscriptor McGovern. Once again Absu does Texas metal proudly. HAIL AND ..!"
3,Dragon's Blood Lotion for cracked heels,"I bought this after I saw a Dr. Oz show where he recommended using any lotion with dragon's blood in it for hard-to-heal cracked heels. I have used it pretty regularly and I have had some improvement but not completely healed. I am considering buying one more bottle, perhaps I need to use it religiously like 3 or 4 times at least each day, every day until it's gone. This lotion has definitely helped more than any other over-the-counter products I've tried, such as Heel-tastic."
1,Looks cheap!!,I bought this timer because it had free saving shipping deal.Now im regreting for buying this.It looks cheap!!
4,Strong Scifi!!!,"In a smooth fashion, Jeter combines elements of the film ""Bladerunner"" with some of the concepts of Philip K. Dick. This is the third part of a planned trilogy, and is filled with action and interesting characters. The Deckard/Sarah relationship goes in a direction you might not expect, leading up to an intersting conclusion. Things are left open for the third book and I for one can't wait!"
4,Entertainment/Tradition,"If you are a fan of Madden football, this is a good game. The main upgrade for this year is the fact that you can really get into controlling the team as the owner, and you can relocate if you have the funds. If you like the GM side of the game, you will love this game. For the actual gameplay, it is not very different from 2003 Madden. Although the computer can intercept passes like they are going out of style. So, this is not the greatest Madden of all time, but still a good game. BJoseph Dworak"
5,"Great Deal, with this product.","This is my first Mac Laptop, I have allways been using PC insted of Apple products. I am really impress how powerfull and easy is to use this machine. The Learning Process is also not complicate, and I can say that in a two weeks period I am no longer a rookie.Amazon gave the oportunitie to change my whole Tec. Life without, leaving my house. A Good Price for a great high quality Computer. Exellent."
5,Love it,"I'll keep this short and sweet As a recent convert to the Mac I was pleasantly surprised at how much I like this little Mac. It just works and does what it is supposed to do. The only reason I have not totally switched over to Mac is, there does not seem to be a Mac version of MS Money or any nice financial software for the Mac. The only complaint is that the edges of the case are sharp and dig into my palms and wrist. I have read several complaints about this issue. That is only a minor issue."
3,MAcBook A Disappointment,"I paid much more for my MAc Book than any other computer and had high expectations. It started off ok. The hardware seems sound, however in a very short time I experienced problems with the photo software. I went to the class, only to be told that my computer worked ""differently"" from what they had demonstrated. Apple notified of a software update, which I downloaded. After that the printer quit working properly. I took it into their ""genius"" group, who after 2 guys and 45 minutes, they advised their printers were not working so they could not trouble shoot. I had taken in samples of the defective printer output. I have had 9 computers in the last 22 years, and had only minor problems, but never one in which I had to take the computer in for technical help. After 5 trips with very limited results, I'm ready to sell it."
5,excellent product - just what I needed,"This is my first laptop and first Mac after using a desktop for so long. There was no setup time, it recognized my wireless network right away, and is so easy to use. Plus it looks great! It has just enough bells and whistle, although I primarily use e-mail and internet anyway. Highly recommended!"
4,a good mystery read,"This book is a good, light and funny read. It is human, it is joyful, it is delightful.I am sure that she has written more since this book because this book was good enough for a sequel or series.Mystery fans will enjoy it.J. Robert Ewbank, author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
2,"Not my cup of ""tea!""","Did not deliver for me. And there is no excuse,i only have ""very slight"" puffiness under my eyes.But in all fairness, even slight puffiness is verydifficult to disguise, or get rid of.Now,what did the trick-100%!! is an very inexpensiveproduct: Chamomile under eye stick. All ""sticks""may not yield the same results, but they are soaffordable,it's worth trying a few, till you findone that's right for you. A drawback is, they areoily! not great for wearing out. I use the suddenchange for that. Overnight, the ""stick"" totally!!gets rid of my bags--TOTALLY!!! So,the suddenchange, is good enough during the day.Good luck!"
1,Forget The SHILL REVIEWS This Book's a Waste of Time & Money,"Unless you like the idea of blowing your hard earned cash for a totally worthless, inaccurate waste of paper; and relish the idea of further wasting money for envelopes and postage to write to nonexistent or way outdated addresses, don't bother with this book. And look carefully at the other Amazon customer ""reviews"" of this book, and take the time to see who has written what (see the more about me entries), and lo and behold, what do you find? You'll need to decide for yourself, but it sure looks to me like the only good reviews of this book appear to be SHILL reviews (I wonder *who* wrote those?). Too bad the rating system doesn't allow negative figures or I would have rated this one minus 5 stars."
4,A New Embodyment,"This is definately not the Embodyment we all came to know from Embrace the Eternal. Its almost like this is a completely different band. Their new sound is more in the vein of Stavesacre. The new singer has a good voice and even mixes in a few screams. Although the hardcore style is gone, this is by no means a ""slow"" album as the first two songs show. Overall, they pulled of the style change pretty well and this is a solid album."
4,"good stuff...but,","this is some good stuff...but, this is a totally different sound compared to the old embodyment. they went from grindcore to emo rock? thats fine and all, but out of respect for the old embodyment they should have changed the name of the band.like i said, good stuff, but the name doesnt fit.tata~mike~"
5,Beautiful Aggression.,"Narrow Scope of Things is extremely unique in that it is extremely dynamic, yet at the peak of it's agression, it does not lose it's beauty. So many metal acts try to become tough and heavy, but lose their sense of melody and beauty in the process. The Narrow Scope of Things, on the other hand, pulls it off wonderfully.There are so many great tracks, many are likely to be lost in the mix amongst melodic giants like ""One Less Addiction."" The album is a perfect blend of extremely catchy but heavy tracks, and less user friendly, yet more definitive tracks. Which blend together perfectly to create an album with unlimited replayability.A rock/metal album full of aggression, yet countered with extreme beauty, which soars to heights which only a select few outfits have ever reached."
5,"New Style, New Vision .... Comined with perfect musicianship","Embodyment has went to extremes. The first album was straight out death metal. The new one examplifies a evolution in style. It's the most a band can change in two years. It reminds of deftones how they went softer. You still get plenty of screaming in this emo/alt/metal album. The lyrics are perfect. Liner notes are all there, unlike some bands. 12 songs make it worth your time. For a band in this genre there really isn't any. Embodyment's style is unmatched which is good. The vocalists is great, he has the availability to make his voice go hard and soft. The guitars have are tuned just right. I like all songs, but the best are: Winterkiss,Pendulum, Assembly Line Humans, and Killing the Me in Me. If you want an excellent cd that is not only well produced, and skillfully played .... add this to your collection."
2,"Nice pictures, story lacking",The pictures were nice and colorful but the story lacked.I wouldn't recommended the book.
5,My son just loves it,"Since my 16 month old son loves his Wiggles movies, we decided to include this book in his Easter basket this year. I'm not even sure why, but he loves it. The pictures are nice color photos and lately it's all he wants to read together. He'll walk over and hand it to me as I'm reading another story to him. It's cute, and he even enjoys holding it in the car to look at the pictures himself. For the price, it's well worth it."
4,"Nice updates of classic carols and some new holiday tunes, too.","I don't like country music but I'd heard Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree on my local station and when I found this CD, post-holiday, for .75 cents, I took the risk. I mean, that was almost a dollar! I love it. Not all the songs work with me since I don't like country but that doesn't mean the songs are bad. They just might please the country lovers. Oh, and yipee! It has one of my favorite songs that is extremely hard to find. All I Want for Christmas is You! Her vocals on White Christmas seem odd to me. The full enunciation isn't there at the end of each lyric. But whatever. It was 75 cents but I would have spent that dollar."
3,Not what I expected from a singer of LeAnn's calibre..,"It is okay. Not great, just okay. I love LeAnn Rimes, and this is not her best. The singing is just ehh, nothing amazing, and she does too much jumping around. It's good if you can add your own touch to a song to liven it up a bit, but LeAnn overdoes it. It is okay if you want a mediocre christmas album. I wouldn't buy it again.If you are actually unlucky enough to have heard Christina Aguilera's Christmas album and this one, I swear that LeAnn copied off of several of Christina's badly sung songs! It's hilarious. She sings it exactly the same ""unique"" way, arrangements and all!"
3,It Didn't Last Long,"Had it in my Gateway laptop for less than a month when there was a noticable decay in the endurance of the battery. Within 3-4 months, it held only about a 30 minute charge and went to zero charge a month later. I initally had charged it fully and depleted it fully a couple of times when I first got it to exercise the battery and hopefully, not give it a ""memory,"" but it still didn't last."
4,Good way to secure and store a trolling motor,"This review pertaints to teh MKA-16-02 Minn Kota quick release trolling motor mount. Beware, there are knock-offs that look similar, but don't work nearly as well (loose fit) and are not interchangeable with the true Minn Kota branded product.I have one boat, but I have purchased 4 of these mounts in order to used the fittings for several purposes.1) I have one installed on my the bow of my fishing/duck boat.2) I keep another one to mount the trolling motor safely out of the way to the basement wall during the off season.3) I use another one to mount the motor to a garage wall for times when I'd prefer not to have the motor on my boat.4) I used another one to mount a bracket from a folding duck blind to the bow of the boat. I also bolted on head lamp.I am so pleased with how easy it is to convert my boat from fishing to duck hunting by using this product."
2,Way basic book,Book is strictly for beginners and really does not cover the difference between behavior in previous windows operating systems and Vista. IMHO it should.
5,Vista For Dummies,This book helps you find all the new features that you have a hard time finding on your own.
4,Vista Dummies,"Ok, but somehow I expected more comparisons with XP. It got me started on understanding Vista. I guess I will need to take a class somewhere to get what I really need."
1,Useless,"If you're looking for something that simply tells you how to navigate through the toolbars to get the job done, this is not the book for you. This is more of a technical book."
4,Windows Vista for Dummies,"Windows Vista for Dummies is just what I needed to allow me to, ""step by step"" transfer from my old program to my new computer... I am not dumb but I do enjoy following instructions, step-by-step, written with a little humor...Thanks,Virginia J. Dolder"
3,Good looking watch but weird design,"Watch is good looking, sapphire crystal promises long lasting and dependable function.The only issue is the weirdest design decision to put timer's split- second hand in place where all normal watches have regular seconds hand. It makes reading time somewhat more difficult sometimes. I used to just glance at the watch to ""recognize"" hands' positions in split- second. Now, I have to look longer to ""filter out"" non- moving seconds hand from the minutes hand. Really, what were they thinking?"
5,great watch,My sieko that I bought new in 1997 finally died. This is the current model replacement. Sieko represents a good value and an accurate watch.
4,"Maintains interest, and sets up finale","There is some action here, but most of the book is puzzle solving, exploration, and the set up for the final installment of the series. If this were a standalone book that might be a problem, but since this is the book that sets up the ending its purpose is to set the stage, and it does that well.the series remains smart, eventful, and well-written, and remains an excellent fantasy/quest intro for younger readers."
4,Hey Hoy Cha Ching!,"This is great stuff! I was a little disappointed with ""Under The Radar"" but The gang has come back strong with this one. All the fun is back with songs like ""Gimme a Stone"" and ""Rag Mama Rag."" Great musicianship as usual! If you are a Feat fan of old ... GET THIS CD! Not quite as good as ""Let It Roll"" or ""Ain't Had Enough Fun"" but a good one nonetheless! Great covers of The Band, Phish and Bob Dylan. Cajun Rock at it's best!"
1,Don't waste your money!!!!,"This product is the worst thing I have ever used in my life. I tried the Veet for underarms. I followed the directions exactly. Did it pull off any hairs? No, it did not. All it did was leave a sticky, gooey mess under my armpit. I threw the whole box away. Don't waste your money, you've been warned."
2,Don't use these on your back.,"They took the hair off of my back, but I am terribly red. My wife helped me do this 6 hours ago, and we followed all directions. Terribly painful. I was using the ""sensitive skin"" flavor, too."
2,not a blues CD!,"I really like Jimmy Smith and his B4... However, this CD has two problems: 1) it isn't a blues CD, it is a Jazz CD. 2) It doesn't feature enough Jimmy Smith, rather the trumpet and sax are also featured. If the CD were called Dot Com Jazz, I would give it more stars, but wouldn't have bought it...."
2,PATTERNS?,"I AM QUITE DISAPPOINTED IN THIS BOOK. WHEN THE TITLE SAYS PATTERNS, THAT'S WHAT I EXPECTED. THERE IS NO RHYME OR REASON TO THE SIZES OF THE SQUARES, THERE ARE NO PATTERNS OR INSTRUCTIONS, ONLY PICTURES."
1,Don't waste your money,"Don't waste your money on these Black & Decker glass/tile drill bits. The blade tip is welded onto the shank instead of being formed as a single piece. That means, these bits will NOT stand up to the heat and torque of drilling trough the material. I spent a whole hour and went through all four (or five) bits just to drill two small holes in the ceramic tile in the shower to hang a rod. The bad news is, I had to drill two more holes on the other side. I went to the hardware store and purchased purchased some Bosch masonary/tile bits (Bosch HCBG0605 Blue Granite Hammer Drill Bit Carbide Tip 1/4 x 4 x 6 - 5 Pack) instead. The Bosch bits went through the ceramic like tofu and I was done in less than a minute. So, don't waste your money these Black & Decker bits or any other welded spade style bits, but get a single piece bit that will stand up to the friction."
4,Nice poster - delayed delivery,"The poster was very nice and just as expected, however they got backed up during the holiday and so it didn't arrive until after Christmas. I bought a nice heavy black frame for it. My boyfriend loves it!"
1,Never could get it to work,"But then, I've never been successful at getting any Nokia cable or the software to work. Guess when I trade phones I'll just have to transfer everything manually. What a pain."
2,wow peopla are blinded by their love for their anime,"the anime was good but what about the game?Just an average hack and slash running around with music that has been looping for six hours straight. i dont recomend it save your money and gaet something good and, if your gonna write a comment actually play the game first."
1,THIS GAME SHOULD ROT SIX FEET UNDER,"Worst game ever. Don't let the other reviews fool you. These people who gave it 5 stars never even PLAYED it. -_-;; They're just yuyu fans like me who looked forward to this game before they got it. I purchased it because of all the 'good' reviews. A poor choice for me and at that time, it cost me 30 bucks. >:|It has mediocre graphics, the same songs are played over and over again, and it's rather boring. The controls aren't that great either."
1,>#_#<,"Well, the graphics were pretty good, but the game was way too easy. I only died twice and that included the fight using Genkai.It definitely wasn't worth the amount I paid for it."
4,WORDS 2007,"I AM VERY MUCH HAPPY TO STATE THAT THE BOOK WAS OF MUCH USEFUL. I COULD GO THROUGH EACH ITEMS IN DETAIL WITH THE HELP OF YOUR BOOK- EVERYTHING IS NARRATED TO ENJOY AND UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING , THANK YOU"
3,Teach Yourself Visually Word 2007,"Apart from the attractive visual instructions, I found very little that was new information from the Word 2000 textbook that I started with ten years ago. This would be a great textbook for beginners."
4,Good Portrayal,The only thing I think could have been better for this book would be alittle more action in cirtain parts. There apeared to be momentary slowdowns in the plot. All in all the book contained a fair amount of action and tied in quite well into the story. I think a few of the characters/places borrowed from the game were not portrayed quite the way they were in game. However granting creative licence they fit in very well to the book.
5,Ginny's reveiw of Goosebumps Welcome To Dead House,"Dear Reader,I thought Goosebumps no.1 was weird.It was scary in some parts.I wouldn't want to live in that house I would be scared to death.When they thought the dog ran away the kids really untied him to kill him.I think it was a good book.Your pal,Spice MCcoullgh"
3,A comment from a 50-year-old on this series.,"This is the first book in an extremely popular series for kids called ""Goosebumps."" All of the stories are the scary stories that children seem to love. There are many adults who have commented on how they dislike this series. They say that the stories are usually not that great, there is little to be learned from them, and that there are so many better books to read by children in this age group. I take a slightly different stance. Any book or series of books that can get children into the habit of reading (period!) in today's world of TV and video games are great! More power to them. I find too many students today, even here at the University, who simply don't read. In this first volume, a family with two children move to a small town in which the inhabitants appear to be zombies!"
5,Best guide on any country I have ever seen!!,"DK's India is a work of joy. Very thorough and informative (including phrase books for five languages and tons of practical tips). Bought it in India and browsed through it as we visited places doubling the wonder of each experience. Written and put together by obviously a great team of writers, illustrators, art historians, photographers, editors and seasoned travellers. I am now finding that it is great for easy-chair travel around India also.Wonderful. Shabash!"
3,Too General,"I think it would be best to use this book only when you are chosing where you want to go in India. It's very broad and has only 10 - 20 pages for each state, and some of the major cities. I went to only 6 cities while I was in country so I didn't need at least 80% of it. It was very frustrating to try to plan out sightseeing the night before because there just wasn't enough information and I wondered what I was missing. It was also very heavy - I almost left it behind a few times because I knew it wouldn't be of much use at my next stop! Your travel guide should not feel so expendable.It does have very beautiful pictures and some good advice but all in all I think you would do better with something more detailed that concentrates on the specific area you are travelling to. Just peruse this one at the bookstore, get some ideas, then put it back on the shelf!! Sorry Eyewitness Travel!"
2,It's Okay,"Product was a big fad, so price was higher when we purchased it than it is now. Kids really wanted it a lot, until they got it. Then they played with it for a while and were pretty much done. No miracles, and no surprises. I don't believe this product will ever overtake ""Play-do"". Seller was great though- they delivered in a very timely manner and provided exactly what they advertised."
5,This is one of the best books I have ever read!,I absolutely loved this book. I am a mother of three children and I could not believe the strong emotions I felt when reading this. It touched me to the core!! I have purchased and given this book to three other mothers. It is still with me after reading it two years ago. I am a high school history teacher and I'm not sure about the historical accuracy but that seems irrelevant to the powerful emotions I felt while reading this gripping tale of a mother's love. Fantastic.
4,would do it again,"Product came in very quickly, overall a good camera and good service.Would do it again."
4,Makes Beautiful Pictures & Eats Batteries,"I received the Fujifilm A900 in an open box, without a lanyard, and with the wrong cable. I wish I had just bought it retail. It makes beautiful pictures, but the controls are confusing. Also, when it goes into power-save mode, it uses battery energy to pull the lens back into flush position. Also, I have to carry a case of AA batteries whenever I got out to shoot pictures, as it uses them up quickly. Aso, every time you replace batteries, you have to reset the clock and date. It doesn't take very good nighttime photos, either. It's still a lot of camera for the price, though. I'd trust it on safari."
4,Wrong color,"This item fits well on an average women 140lbs 5'3"". Delivery was extremely fast. The color pictured was completely inaccurate, though. We received a blue costume with pink designs plus other colors and designs in it too. It still worked for our purpose. It just took us by surprise that it was such a different color. The style was accurately described."
1,Red 40,"I was looking for a decaf version of ice tea mixture for my kids. When I read that it is ""100% natural, no added preservatives and colorings""; I said great I found one.The I looked at the Ingredients.The Ingredients are... Sugar, Citric Acid (Provides Tartness), Instant Tea, Silicon Dioxide (Prevents Caking), Red 40, Natural Lemon Flavor.Not only it has preservatives, it has Red 40, which is actually bad for children.This is not the only tea mix with lies, there are many others.I like to give zero stars, but there is no option."
2,A Dull Collection Of Tired Out Commercial Dance Music,"This is a very sad collection indeed! You get none of the spectacular mix work that Junior is known for,(and he is a GREAT D.J!) you get none of the fun funked up Tribal like songs he is known for spinning and gone are the drum heavy spicey mixes that send you into orbit. A once over gives you the impression that some dork of a record exec got his/her hands on it and required Junior to ""broaden"" the appeal..this one will have you searching for the Spice Girls on it as its the only thing missing. Save your money and wait it out for Junior."
4,Good for what it is,"I like to take pictures, and my husband wanted a camcorder, so when we saw this at Wal*Mart for under $100 we thought we'd give it a try. I've been using it as my main camera for a little over a year and it isn't too bad for just family photos. The camcorder is fun to play with, and I sometimes use the MP3 player. It was worth the money.However, eventually you are going to want a better camera. Indoor shots all come out slightly dark and yellow. But don't expect to get a better camera for this price. I am looking at $300-500 for the quality I really want.I am trying to decide if I will give this camera to my 8yo daughter when I am done with it. She's a budding photographer and she will enjoy taking videos, but honestly I think the camera she has now is better quality than this one!"
1,Worst camera ever.,"There are only four good things about this camera.1) The sound is excellent2) It uses the SD cards for storage3) It uses AA batteries (not included)4) The user interface is pretty easy to figure outOther than that, this is the worst camera I've ever used. The zoom is jerky. The resolution is pitiful for a supposed 5MP device. You can't use the flash to light the videos. It takes several seconds for the flash to recharge before and between pictures. I get better quality video out of my pentax digital camera.I returned this item after playing with it for 10 minutes. Save yourself the headache and keep looking."
4,Great Gift,"My 10 yr old daughter wanted a camcorder for Christmas. After much research, I chose this model based on price and complexity appropriate for a 10 year old. I was pleasantly suprised. My daughter is thrilled with it, and uses it proficiently and frequently. An external memory card (not included) would probably be appropriate since the internal memory is limited, but in all, it was perfect for the price. I recommend it."
4,Aiptek 5mp digital camcorder,"great first camcorder/camera for our daughters bday, eats batteries like crazy, sugguest a rechargeable battery set up. But very satisfied, and good price too"
3,It's okay.,"The camera and video work, but neither are the best quality. I bought it for my 17 yr old though and she loves it and uses it all the time. I guess it depends on what you are using it for. If you want good quality pics this is not the best choice in a camera."
2,Just don't drop it,"I bought this for my son for Christmas last year. He wanted a camera and a way to make videos so I thought it would be a perfect combo. The video capabilities were perfect for him. He was able to easily shoot video and play it back on the Aiptek, the tv, or a computer. The camera, however, is not worth it. The photos are blurry and grainy. He was disappointed. While on vacation he accidentally dropped the camera from thigh height (he's 4'7"") onto a stone surface and it broke beyond repair. We purchased the FLIP recorder for him this year and it works even better for his video."
1,Does not work!,"What a waste of money...has not worked from day 1--fairly cheap, so I'm not going to worry about a return, but my advice is do not buy this item...I would probably go with another brand!"
3,Old wine in a new bottle,"While Camp's approach is interesting, he really doesn't add anything new to the already vouminous literature on this subject. There is nothing in his approach that will not be familiar to anyone with a modicum of experience. It's just a clever title, used to sell the same old --albeit good -- advice."
4,Great book on Great Northern,"This is an easy to read book about the Great Northern Railway. The book covers the history of the railroad in great looking black and white photos. But if you wan't a lot of information on the railroad, this is not the book for you. The pages are very spaciuos with generally one or two photos on each page and a total of about 15 pages of text. With that in mind I can really recommend the book. It's a great way to spark an interest about the Great Northern Railway."
5,FIVE STAR EXPERIENCE,"PURCHASED AS CHRISTMAS GIFT FOR MY SON. HAVEN'T WATCHED IT YET, BUT I KNOW HES GOING TO LOVE IT, BECAUSE HE LOVED SHALON SOCCER."
4,Little Loon and Papa,This book is cute because the little loon doesn't want the diving lessons and his papa still makes him. Then he looses his papa and goes to a bunch of other animals looking for his papa. He ends up running into some pretty scary animals.
5,My six-year-old LOVES this book.,"She has asked for it three nights in a row, now. There are lots of fun sound-words written in all capital letters (""HOO HOO HOO"" ""SQUEEZE TUCK ZIP"") and she enjoys reading those while I read the rest of the text. It's a great way to share reading. I also know she relates to Little Loon's struggle to face up to his fears. She cheers every time he makes it under that log and back to Papa's protective wing. A joy to read and share."
2,Heartbroken,"Not a lot of movie soundtracks seem to click in this industry these days. In fact, they all seem to fall flat on their faces. In the case of Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers, they only have one good song on the soundtrack to the movie She's The One. The song Walls, still creeps in as a very decent song. Still, the score wasn't anything to rave about. Hopefully, the next time that Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers do a soundtrack, it will be of better standards."
3,4 great songs,"This album has 4 great songs on it AND all 4 deserve to be on a much needed ""GREATEST HITS 2""...collection, by tom petty. The song's--""WALLS,CLIMB THAT HILL,HOPE YOU NEVER,CALIFORNIA""....are just simply awsome. Mix these hit's with WALFLOWERS,LAST DJ,HIGHWAY COMPANION...and TOM PETTY will make a ton of money off , what is badly needed ""GR. HITs 2""...for it's fans ( which can't wait for this, by the way, to come out )."
3,Alright For Now,"If you're into Tom Petty, then you'll find this CD rewarding - if you only have 1 or 2 albums you wont. It certainly takes some time to get into this recording but there are some great songs here. WALLS is the standout and the slower ANGEL DREAM is good but my personal favourite is CALIFORNIA - some words about about a place like nowhere else. Tom Petty certainly knows how to right a great song. Not my favourite TP album but one worthy to be in my collection."
5,SOLID !!!,THIS WAS A GREAT DEAL ! AT A GREAT PRICE ! LOVE TOM PETTY...............PLAYS CLEAN ! LIKE MINT !!! THANKS !!!
5,Funniest book I've read in a long time!,"I've read so many romance books over the years that it really takes a lot to get me to laugh out loud - but I was laughing to the point of crying when I read what Soldier and Betsey wrote at the writers workshop!Yes, some of the ""punny"" humor seemed a bit forced, but it was very cute just the same. Betsey handled her mother very well, and I loved her relationship with her schizophrenic father. I'm also looking forward to Marianne Stillings' next book!"
4,JUAN SULLIVAN,"What a match! Grayson, the beautiful physiognomy, clothes-model, and concert-quality singer was the best of her time (see her in ""Kiss Me Kate""); and Mario has a magnificent voice. It was unfortunate that Mario was too out-of-condition to play ""The Student Prince"". Instead, the role went to Edmund Purdom. Also, Mario was made for the musical Carousel! None sings ""If I Loved You"" so well.But, we are happy to have the video tapes and recordings of theseperfect performances available in the market place."
3,Meets expectations,"I saw the preview for this movie several times on a DVD I own. It looked like it would be quirky, but probably not a great movie. And that's exactly what it was."
4,Beats a bag,"The Bucket organizer with 61 (!) pockets gets filled pretty quickly, so make sure you buy a bucket bag with MORE pockets than you THINK you'll need.Works to dry paintbrushes after cleaning and holds all the painting prep tools, while holding everything but the poles.Using it for general drywall work, it will hold the router, screw gun, tape in center - pretty easy to grab quickly, and loads of incidental tools, but tapers, DON'T put your good drywall knives in a bucket. Your most used hanging tools will be in your bags, so this will make an easy carry - just get a bucket from your taper.Following this purchase, I saw a very good one at Sears for only 12.95, with pockets in the 42 range.This is why it didn't get all the stars."
5,Great solution for tools,"I bought this as a Christmas present for my father... okay, it was really for me, for him. He used to just throw his tools into a 5-gallon Home Depot bucket, and whenever I needed something, it took me forever to find it. So, in comes the LeatherCraft unit and now all of the tools are well organized. I couldn't be more pleased with the product, and I know he feels the same way."
4,VH~1 Born To Diva,"She is currently appearing on VH-1 Born To Diva. She has a FAB voice. I was wondering if she becomes VH-1 next Diva, will she continue on singing Gospel or go R & B. Results, will air for the winner May 22, 2003 on VH-1....Whatever the results are, the lord has blessed her with a beautiful voice.Blessings and Harmony"
1,Poor Design,"The problem I have is the location of the power switch, very easy to accidently turn it off. Also, case is of poor quality zipper handles broke in a short time."
2,perfromance ok sound quality very bad,"The quality of the recording is horrible. The sound of the calliope is only slightly louder than the hiss. I don't understand how a modern recording could sound so bad. Many recordings from the 40's like Frank Sinatra sound much better. I only gave it 2 stars because the music is well played, it may be automatic however."
3,Soft Plastic Equals Terrible Smell,As far as Ellipses go this product is fine and you get what you buy. I would like to point out that the smell that came out of the package was beyond terrible. My wife opened it and started gagging. At first i thought she might have been overacting but once i got within five feet it hit me like a fist. I'm trying to soak it in white vin. to see if it'll help. we'll see.
2,Dry Tube for Birds,"This was a disapointing tube of dry bird junk. The Quaker Parrot didn't like it, it smelled funny, and there is nothing for him to grab onto, except of the bell."
2,"Surprise with ""Trapeze""","I was quite disappointed to find that the DVD of Trapeze which I ordered had Korean subtitles. I have not opened and played the DVD because it is a gift, but I will try to find one to give which does not have this unwanted addition. I wish I had read something in the original description that stated this DVD had subtitles. Darn."
2,Regarding the Tao of Watercolor,"This book promotes a certain way of painting watercolors which, while no doubt spiritual and heartfelt in its intent, leaves much to be desired in terms of actual painting. Much of the techniques shown here are short cuts and visual platitudes that create very cliched pictures. The author's spiritual approach to the act of painting is worthwhile but if you really want to learn how to paint watercolor, buy books instead on Winslow Homer, John Singer Seargent and Thomas Eakins and study how these real masters used the medium."
4,great buy overall,Definitely leak proof and Definitely keeps your drink HOT for a long long time. Excellent quality! Just wish i didnt have to turn the top everytime i wanted to drink from it. It's not annoying enough to keep me from purchasing again. For that reason only i gave it 4 stars.
5,Great Rock CD!!!!,"I must admit, I am not a fan of live music CD's but this one is great. If you are unfamiliar with Thin Lizzy's music, this is a great place to start. All of the great song's Thin Lizzy had done in the past...The Boy's are Back in Town, Cold Sweat, Jailbreak...they are all here! This live CD features the fantastic guitar work of Guitar God, John Sykes (Whitesnake, Blue Murder, Tygers of Pan Tang) and the excellent drumming of Tommy Aldridge(Whitesnake). This pair of former Whitesnake musicians gave these Thin Lizzy tunes a harder edge than what has been heard on previous recorded versions, and if anything, they actually make the songs sound better. It is an upbeat rocking CD!!This CD will appeal to all Thin Lizzy fans, Whitesnake and John Sykes fans. No CD collection is complete without this...its a great CD and I highly recommend it!!"
2,This book is great about confusing beginners.,"This book is great about confusing beginners. I haven't read the whole book yet ,but so far it's been pretty confusing to understand the examples that they show because they don't explain the code clearly. If this book is pretty confusing to me even that i have basic programming knowledge, I can't imagine a total non-programmer learning javaScript from this book."
5,Really liked it (as a beginners book),Out of all the documentation for beginners on Javascript this is the best book I've read. It had great usefull examples and explained stuff in a straightforward easy to understand manner.
1,umm?,well had I actually got the item I ordered.. which were these shoes.. instead I got a dress which was double the cost of the shoes.. I wonder how the wearhouse ppl messed that up? hahahah
4,SR-71 Blackbird,"Was so pleased to get this book. Crowood Aviation series puts out some amazing titles. I even paid the full price without hesitation when I cold have bought 2 other books for this price. Imagine my surprise when I opened it to find it printed on poor quality paper. The book in itself is excellent but if one is paying a more than higher price than other titles from this publisher, I would have expected a better quality paper. It's probably a stupid point really but it ticked me off. Aviation Magazines don't print anymore on this quality of paper.Excellent book though."
5,The side the movies haven't yet portrayed,"When I think about the Vietnam War, I picture the combat scenes from the various Vietnam War movies. This book offers a glimpse into the post-war era. It shows the continuing battles fought by these soldiers back home with others and with themselves. The book is a real eye-opener and will make you see our veterans in a different light."
3,There's better...,"There's a better CD for music of Victor Young: ""Cinema Rhapsodies: Musical Genius of Victor Young,"" and Amazon has it. Check it out instead. Good liner notes IN ENGLISH and seemingly carefully compiled by a label and producer. Much better sound too, though it still smacks of '50s soundtrack quality."
5,"Love the watch, very unique","I bought this watch for my wife and it looks so good on her! She loves the two-tone band and the beautiful black mother-of-pearl face gives off a radiant pink, and sometimes blue look to it. This watch goes with everything and with the Seiko reputation, you know you have a quality watch."
3,Colour is different,"Love YSL products but a little disappointed in this blush. First the case was damaged in several places but the blush itself was fine so can't really complain with it only being $15.00! However, it would have been nice to know that the case would not be perfect. The product was labelled as new but there were several scratches and dents on the case. The colour in reality is a lot pinker than in the photo. However the price was excellent and the blush is still lovely to wear although not quite what I was expecting."
4,A Surprise Hit,"With all due respect, anyone that throws a CD out of his car within 15 minutes of purchase and then writes a review shouldn't be reviewing at all.I found this CD in a local store and it was cheap so I picked it up. Surprisingly good. I agree, the beginning of the CD sounds stupid (begins with a radio commercial for the event), but the meat of the mixes is great. Finally, some energetic trance! Great melodies.NOTE: Look at the track list. 36 songs. This is a ONE CD album. Basically, almost none of the songs are complete. The mixes cut in towards the chorus and main melodies to fit the entire event on one CD.Overall, go out and get this CD. Looks cheap, costs cheap, but the music is not."
3,Polycom 2200-16155-001 SOUNDSTATION2 Extension Mics with Cables,"Polycom 2200-16155-001 SOUNDSTATION2 Extension Mics with Cables.I had to return this product.The specifications were not detailed enough when I read the information online. I needed microphones for an audio tape deck (stereo) for documentation. If it were phono or RCA connectors it would have been fine I believe. The connectors on this product were telephone jack connectors. While all the other print information for this Polycom product looked fine, unfortunately it was the wrong choice.Again, nothing in the online text for the product explained that the connections were telephone connectors."
5,Utter Brilliance!,This text provides the tools necessary to make an informed decision as a member of the financial senior management team. The most valuable element of the book is its current and future approach to valuation. The modeling techniques allow the reader to properly access and implement innovative methods for proper and precise valuation. Thank you Mr. Glantz for making me look smarter to my boss and other senior members of my large capitalization company.
2,Poor Sound Quality,I bought this album several weeks ago. When one use to walk past a carousel the bass drum would stir your insides and the sound was incredable. In spite of an exotic sound system this album sounds as if it were recorded over the telephone. Take a pass on it.
5,Mach 5 Speed Blizzard Black Metal,"When I first listened to thiscd, it gave me chills from head to toe. There is no otherband that comes close to whatImmoral does on this cd. The songs are so fast and brutal it really pumps me up. If you like ultra fast black metal, Isuggest you get this one. Youwon't be disappointed, guarandamnteed!"
4,"fast, heavy, cold, brilliant (P.S. buy cd's by ELEGEION)","i think the title says it all but mmmmmmmmm well.......... its got very good tune its heavy and is everything that you want, or need, in a legendary metal album such as this. i sometimes prefer this one to S.O.N.D. because its heavier and less clean cut, in a good way, as well as being a lot colder it actually makes you think of Norway where i think these guys are from( its only been given four stars coz only ELEGEION-ODYSSEY INTO DARKNESS can ever be given five stars by me. so sorry about that)"
3,Brides of the West 6,"Hmm...Patience was another good story by Lori Copeland, but I must say it was my least favorite of the Brides of the West. There were several errors in the scene that connected the beginning with the end of book 5, but maybe I was the only one who will notice :) Also, in Glory it was mentioned that Patience had blond hair, and I was looking forward to a blond heroine only to find that her hair color had changed by book 6...now she's a brunette! :)I was very intrigued by the mystery regarding the mine, and the little man who keeps appearing (or does he?), but it seemed that this book had more romance in it than the others and I appreciated the fact that the others were so very tame. It wasn't awful though.Overall: I liked it."
2,Misleading,"The picture for this product is very misleading. It shows a work site radio included in the advertisement, but when you get the shipment there is no radio. I believe this is false advertisement. I've purchase a lot of things from Amazon, but I am very disappointed with this problem."
3,"Picture quality is nice, BUT....","I bought this for my Mother-in-law's 70th Birthday so I only have to load images once (I hope)...which is a good thing!Picture quality is nice, and the wooden frame is much more traditional than others I've seen.It took a while to figure out how to work it with my MAC...and after that, it was still cumbersome to load images. It kept creating smaller duplicates of all images loaded. I was able to delete them, but the instruction manual doesn't match the buttons on the remote control, so that took another half hour to figure out.If you have a PC it's probably easier to use, and it's nice quality for the money."
2,Incorrect numbered CD's,This CD is beautiful. But the CD's are incorrectly numbered and the order of the songs is incorrect.Steve C.
4,Grim Winter hails Blodhemn,"Infernal hails.... Yet another incredible recording from these Norwegian gods! This album has speed, power, melodies, great harsh vocals and awesome lyrics. A little more ""generic"" in sound with some thrashy parts and the Abyss recording, they also have added a second guitarist whose influence is huge, and have stolen drummer Dirge Rep from Gehenna. This is a great cd. I liked ""Eld"" a bit more but its still great and Enslaved are like the only TRUE band from Norway now."
4,Living Machines,I found the book to be very informative. It was specific enough to understand his work even if you aren't a biologist yet tied together nicely with an holistic paradigm that wasn't overdone. His vision of the ideal future for urban planning seemed reasonable and worth aiming for.
1,Not what it says,"I was given this item as a gift. I have a Bosch compact kitchen center that starts with MUM 4, so it should have been just fine. But it didn't fit the machine and it didn't come with the disc holder either. It was quite a disappointment for both me and the giver. Cindi"
2,OK Quality,"I'm a gamer, and I listen to music infrequently. I purchased this sound card along with the barracuda Headphones. The sound card was ok quality(way better than my onboard sound for sure). The headphones were terrible though and ended up with 2 defective pairs before I gave up on them. That being the case, the card stinks, as you have to use a dongle off the back of it to use normal 1/8"" jacks. The dongle projects out fairly far (about the distance of a monitor/lcd video cable. Because of that and the enclosure I have it in, the cable got a short in it. So I just returned the soundcard, and got a XI-FI Gamer, been happy ever since."
2,Not happy with the AC-1 Sound Card,"I bought this sound card with the Razer gaming headphones. When everything is working the sound is phenomenal. Unfortunately, I am mostly stuck with only the center channel working when I use the headphones, and when I use speakers I often have random channels cutting in and out for no reason.This really could be a killer sound card, but Razer needs to work out the bugs first."
2,Nasty Little Bar,"I suppose if you are a big fan of dates you might like this thing because that's all it tastes like. No chocolate flavor. No coconut flavor.I'll eat them all because I paid for them but I won't buy anything else from this company.I gave it two stars because it's not bad for you (not the same as good for you).Later: Okay, I've eaten the whole box and they kind of grow on you. If you really like dates, you'll really like this bar. But I still won't buy them again."
2,Not for chocolate coconut lovers..,"I love chocolate and coconut combination, and expected to have more chocolate-coconutty taste from this. Instead, it tastes more like prune with grains, and could not taste much chocolate nor coconut at all. Quality of the food is excellent (ingredients.)"
1,all I can say is WOW,"WOW this is bad. Reading other reviews and being interested in tech/math rock metal, I almost have to laugh at the thought of these guys being any where close to either. I was turned on to them b/c some people compared them to Hella. This is basic straight forward stuff. Nothing like Hella and no tech math about it. Yea there are changes but nothing off the wall or new at all. The beats are boaring and most of the all the vocals are without a doubt probably the WORST I have ever encountered. I tried to block them out and listen for some interesting instrumental stuff but couldn't really find much of that either. If I can find someone to give this to I will (pity on them), otherwise its going right in the trash where it belongs. 0 Stars if I could."
5,just a letter,This is a great book that is very easy to understand and I'm just 15 years old if that tells you anything. It is a great book and I would recommend it to beginners and experts alike.
1,"Non-local authors, non-local publisher.","The Lewis's have quite a routine: move into an area where there is already a plethora of good guide books, borrow the research and trail information, change it round to suit their niche (hiking with kids), provide no acknowledgement or recognition of their sources, no bibliographic matter, no reference lists, and bingo, an ""original"" book. This formulaic approach to authorship is in many respects dishonest, infringing, and presumptuous. As for guidebooks in general, there are much better ones around."
2,Not Solid Copper....It is Plated Metal,This product is listed as solid copper with nickle....It is plated steel with brass accents. Way over priced for the quality. False Advertisement to say the least.
3,Good story but borders on purple prose,"Good story, well-developed characters but some of the jargon and dialogue - egads!"
5,OUTSTANDING MEDITATIONAL CD!,This is a must have for fearful flyers. Her voice is soothing and comforting and confident. I highly recommend this CD. Simply listen to it in the car and your flight will be smoother!
2,not quite what I hoped for,"A very nice little kit with several not so nice drawbacks. As soon as I used the brush, the handle broke off. The green tea scent seemed pretty weak, not the green tea I'm used to. Yet, after a few uses I found the candle and the soap quite delightful, despite their lack in scent. It almost justifies the purchase. In any case, it is not quite the ticket to perfection it is advertised as."
5,There's Still Great Original Music Out There!,"This is a truly great record from indie artist Brandi Shearer. I can't seem to find out much about her, but a friend recommended her CD to me, and I was NOT disappointed. Really clever songwriting, super talented. A welcome break from the current cookie cutter music scene. Get this album, you'll love it!"
3,Excel 1007VBA for Dummies,This a good book but could have been shorter and with more screen shots to support the lessons. Too many words does not register the basic idea in reader's head. And when it is time to apply the ideas to some specific projects I start to thumb throught index and the pages. Why can't the authors condense their ideas into some straight forward sentences? Authors of technical books should try to keep the readers awaike. I would say that an opportunity has been missed here to make a good book into a great book.Excel 2007 VBA Programming For Dummies
5,The Old Man Warms Up,"Compared to his early, tortured writing this collection of later pieces is warm and funny. Not to say that Cioran has dropped his nihilistic stance, but a laconic, slightly more personal and witty voice predominates. My favourite book from Cioran."
5,A classic study,"A.C. Graham's Disputers of the Tao became an instant classic when it was published in 1989. Graham was the foremost scholar in his field in his day, and this book is still the standard study of early Chinese philosophy. (My understanding was that this title is out of print, so if it is still available, snatch it up quickly.)However, the book is becoming more and more out of date with every passing year. This process of obsolescence is not due to any fault in the work itself, but to the continual discovery of new texts that Graham could not have taken into account, and to the improvement in our understanding of the received texts that the new ones have made possible."
2,works but flimsy,"This things works, but from the picture you can not tell that it is actually made from very thin plastic so that it flops around. It should be better quality or less expensive."
1,still did not correct wrong description of product,"I have ordered the above, since the description & song names had a song in it that I wantedunfortunately the 2CD set received has absolutely nothing to do with the description and the songs of the product indicated are completely different than the description!very disappointing, since I had to return the 2 CD set (have it already) and then downloaded the song I was hoping to get on the CD -but did not- from itunes..wish Amazon would update/change the description to match the product"
2,Stay Out of The Basement,"This book is good enough, pointing out the fact PLANTS CAN KILL TOO. Casey and Margaret's dad has been working down in the basement making plants scarier than they already are. Now Casey and Margaret are seeing really creepy things around there house. Margaret and Casey need to find a way to kill their plant father. And yes, I said plant father since their father is a plant.The characters in this story are just clueless. They're just making it harder than it is to kill the villian.Okay Story"
4,"Constant adjustments, but good comfort","Everytime you get up off your knees, it seems the straps need to be pulled back into position, and or adjusted. Also they do pinch some behind the knee when wearing pants. BUT, the overall funtion of knee comfort can't be beat with the gel. You can be on your knees all day doing tile work and your knees will love you for wearing these pads."
5,The funniest thing I have ever heard,"This is an incredibly funny CD. I was laughing so hard at *Eggs Like These* there were tears running down my face. *God Loves the Irish* is brillant, and the Inappropriate Singing Styles are hysterical. I would go see these guys in an instant, or wait on line to buy their next CD. Especially if you like parody and clever lyrics, buy this CD!"
5,"Introduction to Business , by Jeff Madura","The book is in very good condition, and fast delivery.Thanks,Javier Gallegos"
5,"Absolutly Excellant, the Best Ever!!!","This is without a doubt the best Spice Girls book I have ever read. The pictures are very revealing!!! I could not put it down once I first read it! I don't see how anyone could resist ordering or at least readinig this fantastic, spectacular, and extremly SPICY book"
4,Nice,"Got this from somewhere else last year. I love it, the smell is great and it lasts for around a month. Well made and I have had some lovely compliments on the fragrance. The only downside is the cost of the refils."
1,I will neverbuy from them again because of their annoying commercial,"I do not own one of these, just fyi.The commercial on Southparkstudios.com is so annoying and its interactive capability lead to a musical theme that is so offbeat that it sounds absolutely atrocious. I'm writing about it here because the ad tells me to go to Amazon.com.I used to buy Air Wick items (fairly recently) but because of the severity of just how annoying the commercial and its music is, I will never purchase from this company again.If anyone else knows what I'm talking about, it's the commercial with the annoying green audio lights and the dog."
2,Looked Better in the Picture,"These shoes were supposed to be coral, but they really aren't. They have a ""gold"" blush over the coral that tend to make they look dusty or worn. I was disappointed."
1,Utter Crap,"I thought ""well if someone gave them a record contract, they can't be that bad"". I was wrong. This is THE worst album I own. I know, different strokes for different folks and all, but I just can't see anyone agreeing this album is acceptable quality music years down the track. I thought it wasn't that bad back when I hadn't heard all that much skate-punk or whatever it is, but there's too much good music out there to waste time with this."
4,"This is a ""best of"" CD - and a nice one","... If you are a fan of Jai Uttal's, you'll really like this record. Then again if you are a fan of his, it is likely that you already have everything on this record. If on the other hand, you only kinda like him, or if you (like me) find the ""concept"" of Jai Uttal kinda cool (a concept that seems to me to consist of jazzy, rockin', westernized versions of ""hindu"" music - that is bhajans and kirtans), but feel that he has been a bit inconsistent in the fulfillment of that concept over the years - than I reckon you'd also like this record, as it pretty much takes the most successful pieces from his previous records and puts them on a single disc. That is a long winded way of saying: if you like Jai Uttal, and you ain't got his other records, get this one. Otherwise, forget it."
5,Straw-Bale Wannabe's Delight,"To be frank, the chance that I'll actually build and live in a straw-bale house is very slim. For those of us who like to look -- and figure we can pick up a few enviro-friendly ideas along the way -- this is the perfect book on straw-bale. The color photos are very high quality, detailed, and appealing. ""Recipes"" for green-friendly plaster and paint are a fun feature. And practical information about straw-bale is useful as I consider ""Well maybe one day ... ?"""
3,it's just ok,"This book came to me very highly recommended, and I think it's just okay. Some of the chapters taught me a lot that was new, some gave advice that seemed very common sense, and some of the chapters seemed to really stretch their subject matter in order to fit under that particular commandment. Some of his suggestions to improve your life he claims are sure fire--which struck me as arrogant, because they were not. Overall, it's not a bad book, but there's much better out there."
5,Drawing board,My daughter loves the board. It holds all her supplies. She sets it up on the kitchen table and works away. Love the product
4,the tao of psychology,"This book proved to be very interesting. Easy to read and understand, helps one to understand the connection we share between others. I was having a telepathic experience and wanted to gain a better understand of what it involved. This book gave clarity to many of my questions."
4,My opinion,"I like this item, although there are a lot of holes in the bottom and tea spoons fall through them down. Very good quality wires. A. M."
2,Very disappointed..,"The sound of this album is far too 80's despite the fact it was released in 2000. There just seems to be no emotion in the singing and the songs themselves are quite drab and uninteresting. Being a rather large Beach Boys fan this just doesn't hit the spot even with Carls voice, which never shows any sign of power whatsoever. Compared to Brian Wilsons Imagination album this is very poor."
5,A book for people who like books about ghosts,"The back of the book:fifteen-year old Dan Roberts is confused about alot of things. Why did his parents decide they must suddenly take a juoney to York, England and why have they been acting so stangely since they arrived?Beyond that, what is the sense of doom and draed Dan gets that Dan himself feels as he approches certain ancheint ruins in the City? Are the moving shadows he sees on the walls real, or just is he beginning to lose his mind?And what of his new friend, the cab driver Joe Stanton, And their enconters with the gypsies? When they're together a stange sensation takes hold of Dan as the distant past melds with the present and dreams become reality.If that doesnt intrige you what will?"
4,old skool rap palestinian style,"If you like old skool west coast rap, then you will definitely like this CD. On the other hand, if you like anything Palestinian, this is a great CD too. Patriarch can rap, unlike many other Palestinian artists, who try hard but simply haven't grown up with rap in the same way."
4,Functional Tool,"This tool gets the job done. I am an Architectural Designer so I sometimes need to go to the field/site and measure existing or new properties. It helps me measure angles very quickly. Whether it is measuring building or masonry walls or odd angled properties. 7"" Angle is made of light thin clear plastic but plastic seems to be pretty durable. I am sure there is many more applications for this tool. I plan to purchase the 18"" Angle just because I want a more accurate measurement. Numbers are clear & wingnut helps lock in the angel desired or measured. The price beats the more professional grade metal angles ranging anywhere from $40-$120. I am not a carpenter or iron worker so this tool works well for my job. If you need to find angles quickly this is a good tool."
4,title of this book says it all,"Interesting tales about a stick and rudder combat flying machine and it's pilots. Much like WW 2 flying. This effective, double rugged machine didn't even have an auto-pilot! Akin to the plane itself, the book is a littleslow in the beginning but really takes off in the second half. --------- J.J. Theisen"
2,Not really about flying...,"Although very well documented, it really is not about flying the A-10 but more about the business of deploying and using an airwing in a combat scenario. If you want to know what it's like to manage squadrons of attack aircraft that get shot at every day, this is a very good read. If you are like me, interested in the nitty gritty details of fliping switches and pulling stick while being shot at, look elsewhere. The shooting doesn't start until well past the halfway point of the book and then it's very condensed and perfunctory. Reading through an action sequence feels more like a debriefing than a page turner.Well written, well documented but unfortunately mislabeled which misleads thrill seekers like me."
1,[...],"I feel like such a sucker. Let me offer a word of advise for anyone considering buying this book. Go to a bookstore and glance through it there first (If you can find it - Apparently it is sold exclusively online. What is the reason for this? Well, it really stinks). The prose reads as if it were written by a fourth-grader hopped up on sugar and children's TV and the entire book is filled with spelling, grammar and punctuation errors. The cloying, syrupy thoughts are rambling and convoluted. I closed this book thinking the author was huckster, and I, a complete idiot for having bought it."
4,China leading up to WWII,"China's history is unbelievably complex. I am assuming the author's history is accurate; not the specific events, but the composite of ""these types of events did happen"". What was described in this book makes the Hatfield/McCoy feud seem like a spelling bee.Mo Yan hits you with realism that will stun you. The book revolves around the invading Japanese; the Chinese who help them; the nationalists; the communists and those who just want to protect their homes and families from all of them.There is a lot of violence and gore; there is romance, births and deaths. This is a moving story. Highly recommended."
4,Powerful storytelling by a master of the craft,"This novel was a very powerful example of storytelling, but having just finished it, I'm not sure how to accurately describe it or my feelings about it. Everything that occurs to me by way of descriptors only describes a facet of the entire work.It is a family saga that is presented in a circuitous manner and in a very earthy exposition. As we learn the story of a rural family, their village and their region during the Japanese invasion and occupation, we are confronted by a union of opposites: life/death, beauty/gore, love/depravity. In this fable, these conjoined aspects are not just coincident, they both emerge as essential for the understanding of the whole.If there is a message to be culled from this work, it seems to me to be that humans are deeply and fundamentally flawed, but are just as deeply robust in their ability to persevere."
3,Interesting tale but difficult read.,"This interesting story was lost to me in a tangle of technical writing and constant references to notes located at the back of the book. Granted, I am an armchair mountaineer and one who likes to be entertained by such books, but Kauffman did not keep me riveted as some similar stories have (Touching the Void, Into Thin Air).However, this is an interesting story and allows the reader to peer into some of the history of mountaineering."
5,PELICAN = GREAT PRODUCTS.,Perfect to cut and keep safe all your equipment!Fits perfect and truly helpful to travel.Pelican is an amazing quality.
3,Quite A Disappointment,"I saw this group on a tv special and instantly fell in love with the song That's What You Get, a funky, dirty pop, jam reminiscent of Nsync and Britney Spears. The album starts off very well living up to expectations that this will be fantastic dance pop album. The first three tracks Dance With me, Messed Around, and Can't Stop Loving You, anre fantastic, fun, and funky tracks that will get you movin. However, the album takes a turn for the worse after these tracks. The album then becomes quite boring, uninspired, and the group sounds vocally tired. The group have good voices but lose energyg halfway through the album. Quite a disappointment considering the strength and energy of the first few songs. All fans of Nsync and Britney Spears should get this album, especially since JC of Nsync wrote 3 of the tracks(which happen to be the best songs). On a good ending note, the album contains remixes of the the JC penned track Messed Around and That's What You Get."
3,Hey,"I bought this CD not thinking it was going to be that great and I was right. A lot of the songs sound very similar just with different words. My favorite songs off the album are ""Messed Around"" and ""Can't Stop Loving You"". In the other reviews on here, everyone else has failed to mention that ""Always"" IS a cover. I'm not too sure when it came out but it is by Atlantic Starr. It's a cheesy song to begin with it and Boyz N Girlz didn't change it too much. If you are a huge fan of pop music then I would totally recommend it but if you're not you will definatly not like it."
5,Fantastic!!,I love the DVD and love the way Alejandra sings the ballads. She's soooo good and sensual. It's one of my favorite DVD concerts besides Luis Miguel. I am now a true fan of hers...
4,Almost too much protection.,"I purchased this item because I travel with a 1550 as a tool box. I do international travel, so I wanted to get something that could keep my tools safe and organized even after baggage handlers had their way with it. I have yet to travel with it, but just after installing it it seems perfect. It is infinitely adjustable, any divider can go almost anywhere, great for odd sized tools. My only complaint is that i feel the dividers are too thick for my needs, they take up too much of the total space of the 1550. For camera guys, it is perfect, but I really needed space more than i need padding. This made a huge difference in how useful my case is, I highly recommend it."
3,Good Ideas,I enjoyed her innovative ideas. It gave me new inspiration. I volunteer for a library that is not aware of altered books and has many books to be discarded. I feel Arendt shows how these books can be put to use instead of ending up in landfill.
2,Replacement Unavailable,"ALWAYS MAKE SURE YOU CAN GET REPLACEMENT PARTS!Sellers here & elsewhere confirm that a 24"" Tube F17T8WW ships with this fixture but not one of them offers to sell additional replacement bulbs. And Web Searches fail to locate them anywhere else either.I bought 3 fixtures last year & 1 burned out quickly. Hardware dealsrs only suggest a similar sized bulb but with a different designation and these go out immdeiatly.So basically, it's $25 for a 'disposable' fixture!"
5,Gourmet mustard,If you like mustard and spices then you will probably love this product.A must have if you like cooking and/or eating!
2,Dial to small,"I need a magnifying glass to read the angle. The plastic is too flexible, would have preferred it to be stiffer."
5,Sebulex,I used for both of my kids it works great but we dont like the smell of it. Best dandruff shampoo we ever used.
4,Used this on baby,"This was recommended by our pediatrician to use on our 3 months old since he had a very dry scalp. We used the product twice a week for 3 week and now his scalp is just about perfect.Only downside is the slight smell, not great, a mix between burned hair and sulfur.I still use it twice a week as preventive measure, so far the baby never got it in his eyes but I can see how this could be an issue."
4,Very Nice,"I was eager to watch this as I received it yesterday. Great I MAX, but too short. I was expecting a the narrator to talk about a lot more great places in the world. Hemissed quite a few. For the most part, visually wise very nice I MAX."
1,"""What Love Isn't"" - original, well-written or enjoyable.","Very poorly written piece that relies on too many jumbled ideas and emotion to make a profit. I did find one use for it. I had my class evaluate it for what not to do. A student's comment summed it up, ""Just because an author can make money off it, doesn't mean it's any good."" How true! I did compare this book with the 1995 poem ""What Love Is"" as one reviewer suggested - enough similarities contained in this book to make it questionable in my opinion. One big difference - the poem was good - the book wasn't."
4,Good and Bad carbohydrates,"Not all carbohydrates are bad for you. As a diabetic I have learned that simple carbs which come from sugars and fruits give immediate energy and what is not needed are stored as fat. The complex carbohydrates which are found in rice, oatmeal, potatoes, whole wheat breads for example supply the body with an energy source that last for several hours. and the fibrous carbs contain cellulose. These are vegtables that should be steamed but not overcooked. I like potatoes very much but white potatoes should be replaced by sweet potatoes in a diabetic diet because they are low on the glycemic index compared to white potatoes. Pasta is another favorite of mine but it must be cooked aldente.This causes the spaghetti to be slowly digested and produces a slower Blood Sugar elevation."
3,Good For Newbies,"Like most Dummies books Dreamweaver 4 For Dummies is an overview for Dreamweaver. For any basic information this book is great. But it is only ok when it comes to advanced stuff like CSS. This book only has around 15 chapters, which is much different from the 25-35 chapters other dummies books have. Having big chapters can make it hard to find the info you are looking for. I would recommend this book for anyone who is new to a WYSIWYG program. But for people coming from another editor you might want to look for a more advanced book."
4,A timeless work,"I loved this book in my twenties and still love it. Its insights are timeless and can appeal to people of all ages and, in my view, different religions. Pope John Paul II often referred to Levinas's Philosophy of the Face. Levinas was able to elucidate quite clearly how a person's face can mirror the divine and immortality. His idea of the impossibility of death is equally poignant, that whereas one dies physically certainly, his or her spirit can never die, as simply put, people touch others' lives as they progress through this allegory we call life. Yes, Levinas is at times obscure, but taking time to read it and to meditate upon it, can give one a refreshing outlook when tackling some of life's demands anew. I also only recently learned that he was a Holocaust survivor. His work seems to illustrate the notion that wisdom can, indeed, come from suffering, if one by human choice refuses to cave in to evil circumstance."
2,not so good,"I wanted to like this book. There were things in it that were good and unique but I cannot say it's worth the read. I do not recommend this book. Out of all of the baby books I have read it is my least favorite. In my opinion, the best part of this book is that it encourages women to have a natural birth and testifies that birth can be pleasant.There are better, more clear founded strategies on how to achieve a pleasant childbirth in Ina May's Guide to Childbirth."
3,A little too much Raban,"The best thing about this book is that it tells you what _else_ to read if you really want to learn about the history and culture of the Inside Passage. The worst thing about the book is that Raban's ego, maybe buoyed by the success of Bad Land, is out of control. Bad Land is a great book about a place. Passage to Juneau is half about the place, half about Raban and what an untamable nomad (but somehow a devoted father) he is, and neither is particularly satisfactory."
3,landlocked reader,"For this landlocked reader I was immediately disappointed to discover that what I supposed would be a journey into the nether regions to be actually a trip along a much traveled sea route. And in truthfullness, for the first hundred pages, the subject matter of the sea, of little interest to me, was very boring. However, as the tale progressed, I admit to becoming more interested, and thanks to the author, more knowledgable. I perceived Raban to be intelligent and entertaining with high marks for being very well read and insighful. On the other, was a collection of ad hoc meanderings, united only by the journey, suffering just a tiny bit from less than totally clear thought process.. I enjoyed the book and would have to call the last chapter memorable."
3,"Nice writing, but there are better Inside Passage books","Wisecracking author grumbles up the Inside Passage trailing a wake of cigarette butts and the scent of stale smoke. Seems disconnected from residents and the realities of the passage. Significant portions of book devoted to his personal life that sounds similarly littered and antisocial. For a great book that's REALLY about the Inside Passage, seek out Byron Ricks."
2,There may be better choices,"I'm not sure I would buy this product again simply because the vacuum opening (without attachment installed) is simply too small and thick walled.Without attachments on, is may be difficult to get into corners.Unlike a dustbuster, the walls of the vacuum opening are thick, and not tapered out. Granted, it comes with attachments to overcome this issue but who wants the inconvenience?"
4,Quite Punk,I just got this CD and It's quite good. Zeke rocks as always. You've got to add this one to your Puink colection
4,this is a good cd,"this is a very good cd if you like hardcore/punk music, but if you don't you will absoulutely hate this cd"
3,Review fender picks,The picks came but insted of the various colors like in the picture all the picks were in the same color.
1,Received and empty outer package,This plastic casing around the picks snaps shut. I find it hard to believe that they accidentally send empty packages of this specific type of pick so often. I ordered 9 varieties of picks in the same order and all were fine but this one. I wonder if one of the amazon warehouse workers prefers these picks? Perhaps they could write a review for us?Check your stock Amazon!
2,Good Product bad packaging,"The pick is perfect, the problem is the package where they sent it. 6 out 12 picks got out when they send it to me and because of that the cost duplicate, I paid for 12 not for 6.Don't buy this product unless they change the box."
4,Just as it should be,"Package was mailed out only a few hours after I ordered it. It even got here a few days before it was estimated. The pics came in a small zipped bag that was stapled shut, then put in a larger envelope. These are really the only picks I use. The only reason I can't give this a 5/5 is because some of the picks looked like they had previously been used. There were large scratches on a few, and some even had the ""Fender"" gold label worn off. While it did not effect playability in any way, it just seemed like the picks were either used, or mishandled at some point. Other than that, very satisfied with my purchase, much cheaper than from a guitar store."
5,The Famous Fender Celuloid Pick,"I never had the opportunity to play with this picks before, I ordered a 12 pack in blue color.The order arrived perfectly, you will receive a small plastic bag sealed with a carton paper on top, stapled into the bag.Once you remove the paper (with an advert for Fender Strings inside), you will notice the bag has a system similar to a plastic zip bag.The picks itself are truly awesome, I play mostly Blues and by far, this is the best pick hands down, celluloid feels great when playing and the pick itself is hard, does not bend, which I like. When playing, this really defines your style, it is a strange sensation since I feel I played differently influenced by the pick.Overall, I feel that this pick is the perfect companion for a Fender guitar, the only downside that I would give 4 stars is the fact that these are Made in China. These should be US made."
3,Packaging is an embarrassment,"I read the reviews before I ordered, but I figured after all of the prior feedback, someone would have decided that putting a piece of tape over the edge would keep the picks in the plastic container. No such luck. When I got them, the picks were strewn all over the bottom of the box. They were all there, but it was like playing 52 pickup. How hard would it be to tape the frickin thing shut."
2,"4 of 12, really?!","Fantastic picks, everyone here knows that. For the ones that actually got 12 picks, lucky you.Now, my package arrived safely, but the pack was opened then taped back together with scotch tape. I can only assume the vendor took out the other 8 picks so they can make more sales volume. Not too surprised at the outcome based on other reviews.Amazon was decent enough to give me a full refund, not a big deal since it's a small item. Dishonest vendors like this needs to be purged from this site.5 stars for the actual product and 2 stars for sending me 1/3 of the order."
2,more like die-of-boredom-a,"I guess there's a story in these pages, but it's hidden in the technical gobbledygook lectures which occur every chapter or so. This book will annoy 2 camps: those of you looking for a meaningful plot or characters, and those of you who have actually studied the math & physics which Mr Egan babbles about. It's sure to please everyone else, though."
4,Thought Provoking Exploration of the Nature of Reality,"Egan book does an excellent job of continually pressing the reader with such weighty questions as ""what is the nature of reality without a physcial connection to the universe?"" These questions about conciouness and reality are brought out the right way - through the story of differing societies that are completely divorced from physicality. Although the plot is a bit thin, I kept flipping the pages based on the ongoing development of the ideas. There are some significant limitations. For those not enamoured by long discussions on speculative physics (like myself), there will be sections that you simply must skim. Also, the last quarter of the book peters out as its discussion of the ultimate purpose of existance become a bit thin. Overall, compelling, thought provoking science just below the ""master"" level of novels such as Snow Crash."
1,Nope...not good.,"The design of this is very poor. I love my Bosch mixer and am ok with my slicer shredder (although very large) but this food processor is not good. The slicing is ok. But let's face it, there are a lot of slicers out there for a fraction of the cost. So the only selling points for this is 1. The grating function and 2. It works with the mixer. While grating the blade feels very ""loosey-goosey"" due to the way it rides on the PLASTIC carriage. Then came the day when, yep, I dared to press a little too hard and BANG the spindle and carriage breaks rendering it totally busted. YOU CAN NOT PRESS AT ALL WITH THIS FOOD PROCESSOR!!! So you have to let it just feed through on its own momentum which gives you mush. So on to number 2...yes, it fits on the mixer but it sits so high up that I found it quite cumbersome to work with. Bottom line...love Bosch, but pass on this attachment."
1,BAD AMAZON SERVICE,YOU CAN WAIT FOR UP TO 45 DAYS AND THEN AMAZON WILL TELL YOU OOPS SORRY NOT AVAILABLE... BUT CONTINUE TO LIST SAME AS AVAILABLE FOR SHIPPING IN 1-3 DAYS.... DON'T BUY HERE...USE ANOTHER INTERNET HOUSE TO BUY FROM
1,Very dissappointed,I bought this for a five year old that thinks rockets are great. The first time my husband helped him shoot the plane it broke the part that holds it on to launch it. We bought glue and fixed it for him. Then the wing of the plane broke. It is only made out of sterifoam with decal to hold it together. I was throughly dissappointed because it was expensive. I do not recommend it. He only got to launch it 2 or 3 times. It was with adult supervision so there was no rough treatment of the plane.
1,Broke during 2nd use,"My 7 year old enjoyed this toy, but the second time he used it the toy broke where the tube connects into the pump. The plastic piece snapped right off."
3,glider,The glider rocket did not perform as well as i hoped. it only went up about 20 feet and looped into the ground.
2,Not enough anti- in the hero,I tried to like this book-- the theme was interesting enough. But in the end it was too theater-y and the main character just didn't have enough bite. Too bad.
4,Nice frolic through architecture and building,"This is an amusing little book about one man's efforts to build himself a study in a free-standing hut in the woods. Like Botany of Desire, this is a rather quirky and unusual premise to base a book on, but again, he carries it off well.If you are interested in learning some architectural history, and something about general carpentry while being entertained, this is a nice find. Pollan has a very entertaining and engaging writing style."
5,easy shopping,I was looking for this filter at the local stores and have never found one. I just typed what i needed on Amazon.com and this purchase was really easy. I received the item quickly and it was just what I needed. I am happy with the purchase. Thank you.
5,Nostalgia,"I never heard of Steely Dan or Donald Fagen back in the time, I was 13 years old. But I knew quality when I heared it.I saw the videoclip and was just blown away. The whole Athmosphere, the music, the beautiful girl. It all made a great impact! (remember I was just 13)But I could never figure out who the artist was, it did't get much playtime and the internet still had to be invented.And now 22 years later I finally figured it out!! Rosie Vela!I can only say that my judgement was not mistaken 22 years back. I am 35 now and it still sounds as fresh as it did then.The videoclip is available on youtube I believe."
2,This edition lags behind by far,"This third installment in the John blair series has fallen off considerably in the selection of house music chosen. All of the songs on this compilation tease the listener with a possible hope at a serious progression into deep house music, but then lags off into weak monotonous vocals that sound soft throughout. The only song on this compilation that is worthy of your stereo is The Vicious Remix of Veronica's ""I'm in Love.""As for the rest of this compilation...it just falls off sadly. For those of you who are used to the pounding Manhattan beats of the first installment, stay away from this one."
3,Yet another liberal anti-white tract,"I do not feel guilty about being white. I have never lynched anyone. The clear message of this poisonous book is that white people as such are devils, and black people as such are victims, if not angels. If you are wondering about white flight from the Democratic party, it is because the Democratic party is controlled by people who think like Carr."
2,Leaves room for improvement,"I did not find the DVD to be very helpful. In fact, I found YouTube tutorials to be much, much more explanatory as far as learning the individual moves. She is so flawless in this video that it is nearly impossible to see how she is really executing the moves. In addition, the beginner hoops sold by the same company are not big enough or sticky enough for learners. I recommend checking out the YouTube videos of Safire, Chemigal and Caroleena and purchasing a hoop thats at least 42"" for just starting out. This DVD is not worth the money."
5,Great DVD!,I love it! Helped me to learn a few fun tricks. The girls are so beautiful and inspiring. Thanks!
2,Lacking...,"I really wanted to love this video, but I have found it to be severely lacking in any instruction. She is a fantastic dancer, but the explanations of how to do tricks was really strange. The slow-mo filming technique is about all this has going for it, because the voice-over skims over everything as if it's nothing - ""Just imagine yourself as a leaf on a tree..."" I will be going back to watching SaFire's tutorials on YouTube. She explains things much more clearly."
2,Not that great,"I love Christabel and have great respect for her, and love the fact that she's from the SF Bay Area like myself, but honestly, this DVD isn't that great for beginners. She's so great at what she does that she flows straight through it and it goes by quickly, not really leaving any time for a beginner to truly breakdown the movements that she's doing in order to do a trick. The DVD could really use some ultra slow motion to break things down step by step. Also, the names that she uses for the moves are WEIRD. I don't understand why they aren't called what they are, you know, something that describes the trick itself. Spunk? Zest? Slinky? Swish? Booty Blitz? Whisper?! NONE of these tell you what the heck they are, and I bet you the majority of the hoopers in the hooping community would not be able to tell you what they are. I have the DVD and I still can't tell you."
5,The best Marduk !!,"This is the album that put Sweden's sons of satan on the map of extreme black metal !!On this album they achieved much more of what was expected, hatful artwork, blasting raw black metal songs, uncompromising hate for religons... this is it !!I remember picking this up in 96"" and it remains one of top ten bm albums in my collection!After that came the Nightwing, also great album but it lacked something, perhaps song writing that Heaven shal burn possessed. If you decide to buy an album by this band, make sure it's this one !!"
3,Does Not Work for EXI 500 Ball Link,"The heli craze is resulting in depleted tock for many manufacturers. I would have thought these would have worked for many mid sized heli's-I was wrong. The Pliers were too large for my EXI 500 Carbon and my Blade 450. Looks like a wasted $20 bucks. They should put in the comments ""this only fits Align products"" if that is the case. The car parts houses tell you what model cars the wiper blade fits - why can't they do it with ball link pliers? By the time I shipped these back I would have the total value of the pliers in shipping costs. I give this three stars because it may work ok wuth Align ball links but maybe it has to be an 800 size heli. I do not have a hobby store nearby so I am stuck with trial and error shopping om the net. I hope someone else has better luck. Happy shopping!"
1,Wenger-73000 The worst pocket watch ever made!!!,"I purchased this pocket watch lets say 1 week ago,and the leather rope chain fell out of the little holder and the swivel clip fell apart. I do not recommend this pocket watch to anyone. The watch isn't to bad, but when you buy somthing this expensive you don't want any part of it falling apart."
4,The World Needs A Hero,"After Risk, Megadeth decided, much like Metallica did after Load and Reload, to go back to 'heavy' music. While I do like St. Anger, The World Needs A Hero is more polished and a better successor to Risk than St. Anger was to Reload. The only song I don't like is the title track. Another song, ""When"", is the longest Megadeth song, clocking in at over 9 minutes. It's one of the strangest Megadeth songs, and it has Mustaine talking instead of singing, which I don't like. He also does that on ""Recipe for Hate...Warhorse"". Other than those few things, this is a great album. ""Disconnect"", ""Moto Psycho"", ""1,000 Times Goodbye"", ""Promises"", and ""Dread and the Fugitive Mind"" are my personal favorites. ""Burning Bridges"" and ""Losing My Senses"" are pretty cool as well. ""Return to Hangar"" is a good song, although I prefer the original. I would recommend this album to those fans who like Countdown to Extinction and Youthanasia."
2,failed attempt,"probably the worst megadeth to date. risk was a much better album regarless of what the critics or album sales showed. i am a dies hard megadeth fan and anxiously awaited this new album, only to be disappointed."
5,it kicks a$$,"Disconnect, Recipe for Hate...Warhorse, Return to the Hanger, and Dread and the Fugitive Mind....need I say more?"
3,Serves its purpose,"Okay, this album is not that great, but at least it's Megadeth. (Risk is NOT a Megadeth album, it's some other rock band's album)Looking at this in the context of the band's overall history, this is a perfectly serviceable release. It's a little too derivative for me (too many of the songs sound similar to earlier Megadeth songs, and the blatant Am I Evil? ripoff is indefensible), but putting it in an overall snapshot of Megadeth's history, this album does exactly what it needed to at the time.I see it as a bit of an apology for the previous album, and reminded everyone that there was still a reason to give Megadeth a chance. Maybe this is not the strongest offering in the Megadeth catalog, but it was there at the time to give us hope of better things to come.I know everyone hates the song ""Promises,"" but I think it's a highlight, a haunting personal effort from Dave."
2,"OF course it is good, but...","Of course this is good, but don't come expecting too much from it, thinking it is the good old Megadeth from PEACE SELLS or COUNTDOWN. No way, pal. MEGADETH reached that natural point where a band just can't release any more masterpieces, but can still delivers great music, which is also natural, having great musicians in its line-up, like Pitrelli and Mustaine. THe album has a good general effect. The main reason I don't give three stars is the copy of AM I EVIL included in the song WHEN. I don't care if it was to be a ""tribute"". If that was the case, make a cover, not a ""new"" song !!!!"
3,The World Needs a Hero,"The World Needs a Hero being Megdeath's 9th studio album and their 2001 release is a mix of heavy metal and thrash metal. The lyrics are ok but nothing special. Some of the lyrics on this release seem a bit pressed like the political light lyrics on the track ""The World Needs A Hero"". This release has a 3/5 grade all over it. Ok guitar riffs, run of the mill melodies and standard metal lyrics. All the lyrics are included in the booklet and a list of whom plays what but not what what brand of the instrument played which was included on prior Megadeath releases. Allmusic and Blender also gave this release a medium grade (3/5) and I agree with them. 3/5."
2,Megadeth's fire has burned out,"After hearing from Dave Mustaine that this disc was going to be really heavy and a complete depature from Risk I was very excited. But after listening to it I am disappointed. The riffs are boring and the songs are not the type that make you want to listen to them over and over again. The solo's all sound the same after a while. Megadeth said they were going back to their metal roots, but they should have said we are going towards a commercial metal approach. If you haven't already go out and buy Peace Sells, Rust in Peace, Countdown, Youthanasia and CW. Megadeth has lost their way and may never find it again."
4,Loved the series,"like most, i got very excited when i heard a drawn together movie was in the works. when it came, it got here pretty early and i popped it in. when it was over, i felt..indifferent. Some of the jokes are taken right from the TV show, so that made me happy,But at times, it felt like it tried to hard.The animation is different, for budget reasons or what have you, and at times, it was great, and at times it felt like it wasn't MY drawn together.all in all, a pretty decent movie and a great pickup for fans of the series. I wouldn't suggest getting this before the series however, because you are just plain missing out."
2,Not what I think,"I was looking for a horse shampoo to my wife because she has fell hair. I read some articles and reviews telling that this shampoo is the best one, and that in the fisrt appliances I will see the difference. I not see nothing..."
2,Dissapointed,"I have a hard time finding cargo shorts I like, I was hopeful these would fit the bill from the reviews. Unfortunately, these fall far short of my expectations.Faults:-Very small openings for the front pockets, my hands barely fit into the hole and I'm not a huge guy.-Very shallow pockets, I would expect things to fall out of the pockets when you sit down.-Drawstring is next to useless-Buttons on the cargo pockets instead of velcro, it's a pain to open and close them-The cloth feels cheap to me, it's not a light material but it's not heavy eitherGood:-Length of the shorts is good, right around the knee.-The inseam length is good, not bunched up at the crotch.Final:I much prefer the Mossimo brand of cargo shorts"
2,Made in China,"I don't care for these shorts. The fabric feels cheap, and the shorts seem cheaply constructed. The fit is odd around the waste band, and the draw strings are useless. The buttons on the pockets are kind of a pain if you're used to being able to quickly get things in and out of your cargo pockets without leaving the flaps unbuttoned. I don't know why I thought these were made in the U.S.A., but they're not. The nicest thing I can say about these shorts is the inseam is a good length."
4,A little big but comfortable,I don't normally purchase clothes online but finding cargo pants or shorts is not that easy in my size. I work out a lot and most of them are too small that I find in stores. I like cargo's for the pocket space and that helps a lot at work when I have to carry multiple items. This has a tie in in the front and it buttons up. My only problem is that I tied up the front and it's now stuck in a permanent knot. I don't recommend tying the front straps to tighten the pants up. Just use a belt and button it up like normally. These are a good quality though no holes or wear patches yet.
2,worked pretty well the first year,"My wife bought this trimmer. I had previously used a good old fashioned scissors type trimmer. It worked reasonably well, although we did have some trouble with the spool head. After I unwound the cord and then rewound it, it worked fairly well. This year, after charging 24 hours, it runs about half speed for about 10 minutes. A replacement battery is only $45.00. That leaves about $15.00 for the rest of the machine. I guess that's about right."
2,Difficult to use,"The price is great, but it takes its toll in using. In order to keep device running, you must keep the handle sqeezed. This requires more than light pressure, so after five minutes or so, expect your hand to tire and start cramping. With breaks, the process can take quite a while and I only have a small lawn. On the other hand, only the lightest tap extends more line so you may end up doing this more often than you want. The low price may be worth the effort."
2,Don't buy this one,"Not enough trim area, the string constantly gets tangled within the spool so you have to take it off and rewind. I spend more time fixing that on trimming. Plastic is splitting apart after one season. Disappointing. I would not recommend this trimmer to anyone."
5,Excellent little trimmer,"I don't understand the complaints about this product. It came in three parts and was very easy to assemble. The bottom snaps to the middle section, no tools or bolts... it's angled so you can't really put it together wrong (well, I suppose you could, but not if you make sure the cord is straight like the instructions say to). The top attaches with 2 nuts and bolts (included), also very easy to do. Five minute assembly I would say for the average person who doesn't read directions...Very handy to not have to unplug my mower to trim. I like it.Oh, I should mention that you don't need to push in the little button on top once you start it (someone was saying it made them tired), it's a safety interlock to keep the big trigger from being accidentally activated.. once you have the big trigger in, you don't need to hold the smaller interlock button on top to run the trimmer. Now I've used it multiple times and am still very happy with it."
3,Good Information-Not Recipes,"I was looking forward to this book, because it sounded like I would have a lot of good recipes to try. That didn't happen. The brown sugar coffee cake was good, as most of their desserts. However, the lunch and dinner recipes were lacking. I read them and decided not to cook them because they did not look nor sound appetizing. I am disappointed!"
3,A TAste of America,The book itself has some interesting reading but the information is really only beneficial to America. THe support groups are not acessible from elsewhere and I did not find the recipes to be hugely inspirational. I did appreciate the stories and tales from people who have IC.
2,I don't use it.,I was excited about getting this and then I actually got it. I haven't cooked anything out of it ever. It is on its way to the used book store
