3,3.5 Stars....HARD ROCKIN Metal and GREAT Lyrics!,"I admit that this CD was a heavier metal sound then I was expecting. I dont' necessarily mind that sound, but I don't care too much for the screaming/growling vocals. Not all songs are this way, but about half of them are.The local radio station at www.897powerfm.com plays one title track, One Thousand Apologies, and I really like this song. They also play My Heartstrings Come Undone from the previous CD and these two songs are more of what I was expecting from the rest of the bands songs. A few of them were very similar to this and some others were more of the rocking guitar (which I love) and the screaming vocals (which I could do without)I am not disappointed in the CD at all, it just wasn't exactly what I thought it would be. But never-the-less I will definately be ripping it to my MP3 player and taking it with me everywhere I go.Thanks guys!"
5,To star wars vet,"I don;t know what the heck you are talking about, this is a heavy cd. And I have no idea what you mean by feminine singing. It's 90% growling/throughty screaming. Buy the cd."
2,Dated,"I love Eddie Murphy on SNL, Bevery Hills Cop, etc., but this was not very funny. It's very dated material. Lots of jokes making fun of homosexuals that are no longer funny at all, if they ever were. It's faggot this and faggot that."
2,You DO need special installation tools.,"The original has ball & socket joints at each end. For some reason, these guys decided they'd only put that joint on the bottom. So, as the other reviewer said, you must remove the ball from the top joint. But what if you need to replace the unit again? It will no longer take the original equiptment. I'm sending them back."
3,WRITES GREAT INTROS,"This modern punk band, like so many death metal bands writes and plays great intros to their songs with a variety of clever beats. However they can't close the deal. After the intro all the music sounds pretty much the same. What's up with that? If you are going by the first few seconds of free Amazon play, you might be disappointed with this album."
4,Very Good,"I had never heard of Stephanis Dotson until a local radio station here in chicago played ""Miracles still happen"". AFter hearing just that song I purchased the cd. I am happy with my purchase. It just goes to show you that GOD will make your NAME GREAT and he exhalts when he gets ready."
3,Sinful,Enjoyed the book.I did however think I was buying the larger book and not the regular paperback version.
5,Hot without being embarrasing,"Unbuttoning Emmalina it's definately a hot read. Reminds you why there are all those buttons on wedding dresses. And might I just say - what a great way to use doilies.Tangled Images was presented before. It's an okay read - I always wonder why Mack (and Mack's family) would endanger his school teacher career by having him be an underwear model. You just know that some people would have a fit about it -- which destracts me from the story.Sinderella is great. Who hasn't wondered about seducing the man of their dreams? All it takes for Frankie is a mask, great lingerie, and a costume party. I love the opening to this book and the fact that her brother figures out what's going on. LOLLeather and Lace was weirdly good. While I would never fall off the catwalk while modeling leather, lace and handcuffs it was still a good story. Loved the ""uncle"" scene - it was good for a chuckle."
4,Erotic Romances that leave you breathless!,"Courtesy of A Romance ReviewFour fantastic short stories led you via the world of fantasies. All four authors had their own way of writing men's fantasies with the magic of lingerie - feathers, leathers, laces, masks, etc. With these erotic elements, this anthology would surely leave you breathless and your blood pressure racing! Sinful wasn't really sinful but a little erotic, funny and interesting. I recommend this book to all readers who love fantasies and daydreaming. After reading through this book, you might consider buying a new set of lingerie for yourself!"
3,J 2 the ROC,Yo this is J 2 the ROC and what's fly is this guy. He's on top of the Hip Hop world with his work n undgrund word up.Breakers in dance beat 5. Word. Peace out.
4,Hard-hitting anthology of atheist essays,"_Critiques of God_ is a hard-hitting, comprehensive anthology of essays by leading atheist philosophers. My only complaint is that Prometheus Books should have updated this book to reflect recent developments in the philosophy of religion since the book's original publication in 1976 (e.g., the kalam cosmological argument, the fine-tuning argument, the evidential argument from evil, etc.)."
3,Depends on what you're looking for...,"This is ok to watch..if you want to see a pretty naked female who is silent the entire film doing yoga poses.What it's not, is an instructional yoga video. It announces the pose before the scene, but does not verbally instruct or say anything. You will fall asleep if you actually try to watch the entire dvd(at least 1 hour), and the lighting is not done very well. The sunlight is way too bright on many of the poses.It is shot in a Japanese-like garden setting with a little brook and some plants all around.Each pose lasts a long 5-7 minutes, and repeats camera angles going slowly up and down the yoga model.It is moderately exciting to see in certain poses, but it's not a graphic porn-you will only see at most some shaved labia. Besides, I doubt anyone could actually watch this in it's entirety more than once.If you are extremely curious about this, I suggest renting it."
2,It is not very good,"It is not very good Yoga video. It is too simple and too slow. On the other hand, her body is not good looking. You can not enjoy it."
3,A true pleasure.,This video is nicely done in a beautiful environment with a very enticing and sensually exotic woman. I found myself enjoying the serenity as well as the sexuality...
2,movie,This is def not something you wanna watch if you wanna do the yoga while watching unless your a woman. dont know how i ended up with it but overall wasnt displeased except for the music.
2,not so good,"not really cover imp yoga postures, could improve. should include key postures and should have narrations. hope to see the better one next time"
3,DVI DUAL LINK,"My New LCD Monitor has both VGA and DVI inputs and it only came with a VGA cable, so I purchased this cable to use the DVI, and I really don't see a difference between the picture quality from VGA and DVI. Don't really need to spend money to change to DVI."
5,"Magic, like no other.","This is one of the most wonderful recordings I've ever heard. Bolling and Rampal are virtuoso players who managed to merge their jazz and classical perspectives (respectively) into a delightful musical estuary that's chock full of twists, turns, surprises, and good humor. I don't know anyone who has ever heard this recording and didn't love it. This was recorded in 1975 so this is a REAL virtuoso performance. No digital touchups. No pitch correction, no quantizing. This is the lost art of great musicians making great music together."
4,Very fun style,I have listened to Jazz for forty years but my wife hates it. But I put this CD on and my wife like myself enjoys the varying styles.
4,Looking from Insite,"This documentary short by homeless teen on streets of Montreal/Toronto is a rare gem of a ""civilised"" reality well disguised with the sparking facades of both Franco and Anglo-provinces of Canada, explicitly-rudely memorizing the lives of others, already dead to a date movie was released, native speaking white youths callously left to exercise the summit of liberties that is factually a freedom from an elementary job and family values, excess of a drug abuse and sex explorations, police brutality and social nonentity."
3,Average,"Product is as described. Breakable to a degree, but grandchild who ordered it loves it. It is quite small for a toy, more appropriate for a display item."
1,dissapointed,"Really disapointed with this item! I thought I was buying a Macaw that was bigger than something you would use in a dollhouse. Shipping was almost as much as the item. Didn't even want to take the time, energy, or expense to send this back."
3,Good,Don't expect top quality sound - this is a 1920's recording - similar to cranking up the victrola! When friends come over they ultimately ask where do you find such cool music.
2,Wont hold up for sport,"I spend a decent bit of time in the gym, and after about 10 uses the stitching tore away from the material that this band is made with. If you do any more than walking i would not suggest this band. Love my zune"
1,Disjointed and silly,"My only advice is to read Jimmy Breslin's ""Table Manners."" It's far better written and makes much more sense."
2,Disappointing,"Lindley goes around several bends analyzing documents, but ultimately he does not have any real proof for his conclusions. Some of his ideas make sense, but I still don't know if Travis drew that line in the sand or if that story is just a romantic fiction. Trying to make some kind of ultimate sense out of obscure, ambiguous, and conflicting documents is more a matter of faith than scholarship. Lindley seems to think he can separate the facts from the fictions, both intentional and unintentional, but it just can't be done. This book is for real Alamo buffs because of all the sources Lindley analyzes, but there are much better works on the battle and its place in Texas history."
5,Excellent resource!,"Psychology from Scripture: Bridging the Gap is highly informative and inspirational. It provides guidance and direction in understanding the Bible and applying it to everyday life. This book should be used as an educational tool, guide for Bible study and text for courses that focus on psychology and religion. It provokes introspection and examination of existential and philosophical questions, thereby generating healthy discussions. Dr. Earl Williams has an engaging style that combines a sound positive approach with practical applications.Dr. Darlene Powell GarlingtonLicensed Clinical PsychologistCertified School PsychologistPublished Author[...][...]"
5,Brass in Berlin,This album was made 28 years ago with the Berlin Philharmonic Brass in Berlin. The music is from the late Renaissance period. The music is played in a manner which would represent the musicians of this time. You have the feeling of being in that period. The antiphonal effects are done with balance and grace. This is a must have album for anyone interested in serious brass music.
3,I bought this book because it made me feel like I was contri,"I bought this book because it made me feel like I was contributing to the cause. When I read it, it was so focused on celebrity this and that. The recipes were not outstanding and I'm glad my money went to a worthy cause but the book lacks original recipe content, the photography is ok but nothing exciting and honestly I sold it at my garage sale."
1,I'm disappointed,"I am truly disappointed in this book. I bought it because of all the positive reviews. However, after paging through, I see no conenction to the celebrities. The food was so-so and I was wondering if the authors really tested the recipes. I am most disappointed that there are so many bad reviews of this cookbook."
2,"cheap price, cheap camera","I've owned this webcam for about a year. It still works, but occassionally my computer won't detect it for whatever reason and I'll have to unplug and replug it into my USB port. That's the only maintenance problem I've had with it.The picture quality isn't too great. It's very grainy and you can hardly see anything in low light. When I do turn on a light, it totally washes out everything and makes it all white. In order to see things clearly you have to settle for a reddish yellowish hue by using the ""default"" setting.The good points are that the camera is very small and portable and extremely easy to install. The software allows you to create pictures, videos, and a live webcam that's really easy to use.On the whole, I wouldn't recommend this camera because it shows very poor quality images, but I suppose you should expect that considering how cheaply priced it is. You're better off spending a little more for better quality."
1,Doesn't work.,"If you have a slow computer (less then 200mhz) The pictures will be a bit fuzzy and the lighting is bad. Other then that I have no complants except that the software only works with Logitech Cameras. However, I love the great features like the webcam.Of course now you have to pay a subscription fee and each new version of the software lowers the amount of custom configuration. Now you can only use the software with Logitech cameras and the webcam feature you have to pay for.I could care less for this camera. Doesn't work all that great."
1,Don't waste your money...,"I had a black and white quick cam that I was replacing. The B&W had 640 x 480 resolution and very nice pic quality for web conferencing, email photos etc... This cheap color version has just awful image quality... I sell alot on ebay, and my auctions pics made with this thing really stink. You can adjust it till your blue in the face and you won't get a decent image to save your life. Spend more money, get a better product than this. You get what you pay for."
5,Best for the price and quality...,"I bought my quickcam express 2 months ago, I use it everyday to chat with my family on the other side of the world(approx 3000 miles away)and this is the very best thing I have done to bring us all closer. About the picture quality I read in other reviews acctually it depends on the processor you'r using it on. When I use it on my LapTop which is pantium 3 with 160 mhz ram and all loaded with advance tech options, this camera works there like I am looking in the mirror with extreamly clear image resolution and when I use it at my home PC which has only 16 mhz ram and limited options it has just very acceptable/not good enough resolution, so for a good processor it is a best Web Cam you can buy at this price."
3,Not so good but regular...,"Tin Tan, as the title says, is an opportunistic man who takes advantage of women, taking money or whatever he can get a hold from them in exchange of a kiss (have you seen his mouth? and women seem to fall at his feet with that).The ''funny'' part starts with a misunderstanding including his friend Marcelo Chávez, and a couple women who are not what they say they are: Celia Viveros and Martha Mijares. These two women, think Tin Tan has all the money he said he had, and to see if he really likes Mijares for herself and not for her money, they plot to switch places.So, Mijares has the money, but Viveros (her assistant) pretends the money is hers. Now Marcelo will go after her. Tin Tan also tries to get that money but the women are very smart. Looks like Tin Tan finally found his match and will have a run for his money! Pun intended.For me, the most hilarious scene is in the night club, between Marcelo y Celia while ordering from the menu... unforgettable!"
1,DIVIDER SPACERS,THIS SHREDDER IS NOT DEPENDABLE THE PLASTIC SPACERS BREAK AND RENDER THE SHREDDER PRACTICALLY WORTHLESS. WHEN SPACERS BREAK THE CONFETTI CUT PAPER JAMS THE WHOLE MACHINE AND MY MACHINE IS LESS THAN 1 YEAR OLD AND IT WAS A WARRANTY RELACEMENT FOR AN OLDER MODEL THAT DID THE SAME THING.
3,Looser but comfy,"I've been looking for a breathable, cute pair of capris to wear when I work out. I usually like more fitted pants, and was hoping this would be a bit more form-fitting than it was when I first tried it. Incredibly comfortable, I think it will be great for my aerobics class or running or just lounging. I haven't yet found the perfect pair of capris, but I have gotten a great new pair of black capris."
5,Soaring and Inspirational,This is the first ever soundtrack I bought. The first time I watched The Last of the Mohicans I was compelled to buy the music. I am not disappointed.
5,Last of the Mohicans Soundtrack,One of my favorite movies. Never get tired of it. And now I have the music - lovely.
5,"A phenomenal CD, adventurous and passionate, like the movie.","This soundtrack is awesome. It is my absolute favorite, and the whole track is magnificent, not just a few songs. It's the kind you can listen to when you need that inspirational drive because the music is so moving and rejuvinating. The music takes you, and then leaves you changed, and refreshed. I recommend this CD to just about everyone."
3,Variations On A Theme... again.... and again,"Jones' beautiful theme is inspiring, even haunting. It is made more hypnotic by the fact that Jones can't let go... the theme is repeated in variations which ultimately undermine the originality and rapture of the score. In short, it gets old after several listenings. Edelman's works strike me as incongruent albeit refreshing to the aforementioned repetition...I found his ""cuts"" mediocre at best."
2,Dangerous Spaces by Margaret Mahy,"I found this book rather boring. I thought the biginning was hard to get into. There were some unnessacary discriptions that just seemed to add on to the pages in the book. I noticed I was daydreaming numerous times, which was a sign I wasn't into it. Near the end of the book it got a little more fascinating. I enjoyed some ending scenes that had a little more action. Overall, it was an O.K. book. I wasn't overally thrilled."
2,Second Choice,"I have two prior HUGO walkers of a better quality and higher price. I wanted to replace a worn out one and this was all that was available at the time. I must depend on my walkers to sit on to be mobile and though this one is strong, it has wheels that are too large to roll evenly or be able to get close to sinks and kitchen work. I thought the one I'd ordered had the older type wheel and was disappointed when this came instead. I will wait until the better model is back in stock to order another."
2,"It's ok, but not that efficient.","The larger wheels make it easier for walking, however, it is difficult to pull the knob on the side to lock it in place. While trying to lock the walker, my mother fell face first. The other walkers you just place on the ground and the walker becomes stable to hold on to. I wouldn't recommend this type."
5,WISH IT WAS ON DVD,I recorded this off my TV back in 1983. I'm glad I did as the cost for the VHS is out of sight!It's a great show and I'm hoping it comes out on DVD. I keep checking Amizon to see if it's on DVD. But so far it hasn't. A truly great one of a kind comic as pasted. A class of his own.We miss you Buddy.
1,dont do it,We ordered the product...our dog loves them...but no one cares if its 100 degrees outside. recieved in one big melted ball. thought they would ship in dry ice. If its summer or hot in your area dont order them !!
1,BLAH!!!,The idea of this book is excellent.But I quit reading it half way through because I got some confusing errors.Like when they were coming back from the indian reservation when Lily got sick. Didn't they come in a wagon? So why did they leave on horseback? Even after Matt asked Kitty to get the wagon. I know it's not a big deal to the story.But I wish it was more accurate. Besides there was dialogue that would include two people and then all of a sudden some other character will be there when they weren't supposed to be in the first place. So the idea of the story was great but there needs to be errors corrected.
2,Throwaway Music,"There are a lot of Billy Joel cultists out there who rank Cold Spring Harbor as their favorite because of its simplicity. In fact, simplicity is the album's greatest flaw. There are only two worthwhile compositions here: ""She's Got A Way"" and ""Everybody Loves You Now"", both re-recorded in superior versions on Songs In The Attic. The rest are throwaways that Joel wrote before his songwriting talents truly flourished (see Piano Man for Billy's true debut). The production doesn't help either. It makes Billy, to his own admission, sound like a Chipmunk!Billy Joel is a phenominal songwriter, but Harbor is nowhere near his best work. An album for completists only."
5,Herreweghe and Kooy : a wonderful combination,"I have yet to hear a recording by Herreweghe that I don't like, and this is no exception. The lullaby ""Schlummert Ein"", from BWV 82 ""Ich Habe Genug"" is worth the price on its own. I am no expert, but the sound from Herreweghe's recordings always sounds richer and clearer than others I've heard, especially by Harnoncourt. Some of the other tracks are a bit tedious, but on the whole, this is one of my very favorite cantata recordings, and one I never tire of listening to."
4,Almost the best,"I have three records of these Cantatas: Pólgar, Opalach, Kooy and Fischer-Dieskau. I like them all but I have to say that the version of Fischer-Dieskau (with Richter) is the more impressive. Kooy is better than Opalach and maybe Pólgar, but not than Fischer-Dieskau. But this is only a comparison, the version of Kooy is very beautiful."
5,amazing!,"the book is great, if your'e an actor, or anyone who deals with shakespeare-get it yesterday!"
3,"Too Heavy, But Recommend","Too heavy to carry to classRecommend if you need help analyzing essays for classQuick, easy, and helpful definitions"
4,Damond,"I think this is a good product. It works well with the book. It is a must have if you are studying Alif Baa in school or alone. You can check your answers. However, since this is only an answer key, you will be disappointed if you are looking for definitions or explanations to your questions.Don't worry about cheating on any test. I have taken several test in a continuing education program provided by New York University. I must testify, not one test was taken from this book.Overall, it is a great buy for those who are using Alif Baa to learn Arabic.4 stars - 1 star is missing because the lack of explanation for new students."
4,Better than the last one!,"This edition is an improvement. It provides complete questions and answers. It is nice to have a quick reference, of just questions and answers. However, I found that I used the material in the Reference Manual more than anything else--especially on the exam."
5,Absolutely amazing album...must buy!,"I know it's pretty cheezy to give your favorite albums 5 out of 5 stars...but I honestly can't avoid it. After nailing the arena rock, hard rock, and acoustic rock genres, Guardian redefines themselves with this dark, moody, alternative-esque album. Don't let ""alternative"" scare you. There is more here than just power chords. Tony Palacios' guitar work is nothing short of amazing. The guy can SHRED! The entire band is outstanding on this disc, and I urge any fan of Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, or even OLD Guardian to give it a chance. Steve Taylor's production is top notch, and his contribution in the lyrical department is a breath of fresh air in a world full of lyrical cliques.Yes, it's a Christian album...but it's an honest album. The life of a Christian isn't all roses as made very clear by songs like ""State of Mine"", ""Hand of the Father"", and ""Psychadelic Runaway"". I can't say enough about this album. ..."
4,Disappointed...,"I ordered this kit especially because it specified that the replacement blade was the ""ice crusher"" blade and it was cheaper for me to order this replacement set (and get free shipping) than to just order the ""ice crusher"" blade by itself. For my location, the shipping is nearly triple the price of the blade! The blade in the replacement kit is exactly like the blade that came with my Oster Beehive Blender, so unless you need the parts...don't bother! I will hang on to these parts...it's always handy to have extra. I'll just have suck it up and pay the crazy shipping to get the real ice crusher blade."
2,Lid didn't fit my Oster Blender,"For what it's worth, the white lid didn't fit my Oster Classic Behive blender. And the plastic screw-on base is much thinner (and seems less durable) than the one it replaced. The blade and gaskets were fine though."
3,Zoo Med,"Well the lamp works well, serves its purpose but I was not happy with the bleak instructions of how to connect the clamp to the base of the lamp. I never could fully get it put together properly so now its just sitting on top of the cage. Dont really understand why they didnt just have it connected to the light already."
1,Safety hazard,"I had this lamp on a timer. I set it on my carpeted floor and left the room to get water for the reptile tank. In the short time I was gone, the lamp turned on and burned a hole not just through my carpeting but through the pad and even charred the floor. This lamp is an accident waiting to happen because the 150 watt bulb extends out almost to the end of the reflector and it has no protective metal cage. Be safe, don't buy it. If you buy it, don't use a timer. In a matter of seconds it can scorch a carpet."
4,Sharantyr...,"Sharantyr is the main reason to read this book. She's clever and feisty, and Faerun can use all the feisty sword-slinging women it can get. She's also in a few other books, but this is the one that introduces her (as far as I know)."
2,Too few moves,"This is really for beginners who want to focus on a few moves. There is no weight involved. It's chanting, yoga, and aerobic moves. I thougt it was going to be life-changing, but it's not. Borrow it from the library to check it out before you decide if you want to buy it."
3,different,"I did this DVD only once so far. I must say it is interesting. It is not like my other yoga workouts. There are some moves that aren't exactly yoga postures. It is however a very positive DVD with all the mantras.. Such as I am strong, I will have all my dreams come true, etc. At first I felt silly saying all these chants. But after the workout I must say I felt pretty good..However if you are looking for a true yoga DVD I don't think this is the one...."
4,Intel T7200 2.00ghz,IT was a breeze installing the CPU. No snag except you must tug the LCD screen wires properly for the plastic cap to sit in properly. All in all it takes me about 45 mins to install and put it together. Don't forget to clean the heat sink and apply a new layer of thermal paste.
3,"Great Bike, But Just 1 Glitch.","Great Bike, Had A good time riding it at 1st. Although 1 major problem makes me frustrated when I ride it now, When I go fast over bumps or anything. the handle becomes loose. The whole bar, and now I have to walk with my Allen key to screw it back tight.So other than that the bike runs well."
1,Terrible,I had this book in University and it was one of the worst texts I've ever owned. The author does a lousy job of defining variables and refers to his pathetic computer program way too often instead of working through examples. Avoid.
5,I love this short movie! Good for my nephews!,"This is a Disney classic for children! I watch Winnie The Pooh when I was a child myself! My mom use to have this movie, but it was misplaced somewhere. So I decided to order it on VHS to replace the collection!Thanks for this movie!Dee SmallsDecatur GA"
3,Works OK,"I have tried a bunch of bluetooth headsets and speakerphones. This one is the best speakerphone I have found though not ready for prime time. At times, people have difficulty hearing me and I have difficulty hearing them. Most of the time the speakerphone is adequate. At other times, especially when I am driving, I have to turn the thing off and speak on the phone. Not great, but I haven't found a better speakerphone."
2,Muffled sound quality on both ends of the conversation,"I purchased one of these today at CostCo and tried it out on my way home. It linked up to my Sony Ericson easily but the sound quality was poor. I called my wife who said the sound was not clear but rather muffled sounding. I had the unit mounted on my sun visor about 8"" from my face. It also sounded muffled to me over the speaker. We have a Prius which is a quiet car, I was driving 60mph on the freeway. The sound volume was sufficient.I'm going to return it. Too bad because the idea is great. I actually refrained from purchasing it on the spot yesterday. I came home and read the comments here on Amazon.com, my source of user comments. The comments were largely supportive so I went back today to buy it.You may want to try it yourself. Who knows I may have purchased a poorly working example."
2,I thought it'd be better,"I read some of the other reviews of this movie which went under the alternate name of ""The Embalmer."" Some people said it was akin to early giallo and others said it was German krimi. Whatever they say, I say ""boring""!Acting was terrible and so was the lousy fight scene at the end. The premise was good and could've been a spine-tingling thriller in the hands of the right director.But if you must get this waste of celluloid, then buy the Retromedia edition as the Alpha print is just strictly for the recycle bin.Don't say I didn't warn you. No one warned me."
3,Lazlo Letters Rip-Off,"Nancy's collection of bogus letters is hilarious indeed, and I'd give it 5 stars if it (and its two prequels) weren't such transparent rip-offs of Don Novello's ""The Lazlo Letters"" (1977). I should think the author would want to acknowledge Novello for providing what must have been the inspiration for this series."
3,Not quite as pictured.,"The mouth of the bowl pictured looks a lot smaller than it actually is on the bowl I received. It doesn't seem to be as tall either... I have a cocker spaniel puppy, and as of right now, he could probably sit in it at 6 weeks old - haha. I think as he grows, though, this bowl will probably be helpful at keeping his ears out of his food. Maybe I'll update on that when he gets bigger."
4,Is big,"I thought that this bowl was smaller than it's turns out. It is really cool though, because my dog can not spill or carry it out for the house."
3,Audio Track is disappointing,"Saw them on this tour and they were great. This concert is great as well, but the audio track is stereo only. It's a Blu-Ray with a DTS HD-MA STEREO track. Very disappointing on a music disc."
2,tb,"Whoever was in charge of mic levels on stage obviously was NOT paying attention. To add, no matter how long they've been playing together they should have put a lot more practice time in before calling themselves ready for the stage. When David and Graham appeared on David Gilmour's Royal Albert Hall concert DVD you can just tell that Gilmour had tighter reigns on the final product."
2,Old guys,"This is all speculation of course since the DVD hasn't come out yet, but if it's anything like what I have seen live of late from these guys, don't bother with it. I was a huge fan for many years. Probably longer than I care to remember, but it's time for them to give it up.Most notably Steven Stills. His voice is shot. There is no way around trying to hide it. It's just gone. And Davids' isn't too far behind. They certainly aren't the only ones that should give it up. Paul McCartney comes to mind, but this is about CSN.Please let me remember the way you once were, so very long ago..."
4,Ordering today,"I went to a their concert in St. Louis and loved the show so I am purchasing this today.I agree that Stills voice isn't what it use to be but he's still one of the best on guitar. Listening to Graham Nash, it'shard to believe he's in his 60's. Sings as good as he did 20 years ago. David is still good.These guys have been my favorite since the 1970's and can't wait to get this."
3,If you saw them on tour in 2012...,If you saw them on the 2012 tour this is good CD and DVD package to remember the concert. I saw them in Nashville.
5,Great Read!,"Todhunter, apparently at ease on towering rock faces, diving in frigid lakes, and storm kayaking, walks somewhat anxiously into the 3 star French restaurant Taillevent for a full course meal. He recounts the meal in such a way that one feels one is sitting at the table with him and his wife watching a time-honored and sacred ceremony take place. It is the ritual of haute cuisine performed meticulously by the world's best chefs, sommeliers, and servers, and described in wonderful detail by the author. Todhunter worked in the restaurant and interviewed many of the principal chefs. His treatment of the various views of cooking as art and the exploration of the contentious politics within the kitchen and between the chefs and servers is fascinating. I haven't enjoyed a personal essay on dining this much since Liebling's ""Between Meals""."
5,Excellent Quickstarter,"This book really helped me learn Director 8 fast! It contains useful and practical examples that make sense in the real world. Included are especially good sections on animation and web deployment, as well as a good starter on Lingo.If you're looking to add Director to your resume of design skills, this book will get you to a solid intermediate level in less than a week."
3,it's ok,"The Visual Quickstart Guides I've used have all been really excellent. What I really needed in a book was an extensive introduction to Lingo. This book only has two chapters and not nearly enough practical examples to really get you flying w/Lingo on your own. I'd say this book is ok, but not nearly enough Lingo examples/exercises."
5,awesome cookbook and helpful planning tool,"I bought a copy of this book several years ago when I was pregnant with our first child. It has helped me to have delicious, nutritious meals already prepared in the freezer and ready to pull out so that I am not temtpted to order pizza on those crazy days that little kids can cause!! The recipes are flavorful and unique, not just your ordinary casserole. Besides the recipes there is helpful information on how to organize cooking days and how to shop for the best bargains at the grocery store. There are recipes on desserts, baked goods, main meals, and side dishes. This is a great cookbook even if you don't intend to cook ahead and freeze, my whole family has enjoyed the recipes."
3,She is Ok,"I liked the Barbie doll,and I think this Courtney is ok.Barbie is better.But I havn`t seen Tia yet.I must wait till the picture comes out.SARA SIBLINI!!!BRATZ LOVER!!!*FOREVER*MY SCENE 1/2 PART LOVER AND 1/2 PART HATER"
1,faulty,"I've got one of these locks, as does another person I know. Both of ours have frozen and don't open at the set combination (meaning even if you go through all possible combinations it won't open and your computer is stuck). As well, they will open at incorrect combinations sometimes. The mechanism is difficult to work and prone to problems because of the way the flip-switch on the back of the lock sits. I do not reccommend that anyone use this lock.I would trust other Kensington locks, perhaps those with keys, but not this one."
1,DON'T BUY THIS LOCK!!,faulty lock that keeps resetting the code & getting stuck. had to use wire cutters to remove. badly made and badly designed. kensington should be ashamed of making this product. i will never buy any kind of kensington product again & recommend that you do the same!
4,Very Good---Love The Attitude,"I Would have to Admit that This is VERY GOOD band.I think that them songs are fresh and Raw & lyrically he got it going on..., I would Have Given it A whoppin' 5 stars BUt I tihnk It is overpriced. (cionsidering all the free downloading online)"
2,The singer might need some psychotherapy.,"Once in a while you come across an artist that sounds like he is truly living the stuff he spews on record. I give him alot of credit cause he does sound talented and somewhat spiritual,(although I don't appreciate some of his blasphemous lyrics). Overall, I would say that it is probably just way to EXTREME & EMOTIONAL for my taste. My kids on the otherhand would probably like it more. (but parents please be advised, there is probably more than 500 curse words on the entire recording)"
3,So-so CD,Found the vocals in the Handel number very jarring---undid the beauty of the trumpet music for me---gave it away without finishing it---knew I would never play it again. Loved Wynton Marsalis in Great Performances: Baroque Music for Trumpets & thought this would be similar.
2,Wynston Marsalis with Edita Gruberova and Raymond Leppard,"I did not want , Wynston Marsalis with Edita Gruberova(opera)and the English Chamber Orchestra, Raymond Leppard. I wanted Wynston Marsalis ""Baroque Music for Trumpets."" The ""Baroque Music for Trumpets"" stirs the soul. The CD with Edita Gruberova racks the brain and interferes with Wynton's artistry. What a disturbance.I believe that both CD's have the same title and thus the confusion."
1,Not for those that want patterns,"Was looking through this book at my LYS & there's not a pattern in the book to be found. I'm not the only person that was looking at it & noticed that. LYS owner is putting it in the 1/2 price basket. Don't waste your hard earned $ on the book, save it for yarn.Jean in NC"
4,"The best of the PFM's ""pop"" years","I do not have the problem that the previous reviewer is reporting, on my copy. And even if I did. Nevermind.Not a bad effort, certainly better than ""Come ti va"" and ""Miss Baker"". A few tracks are pretty good actually : ""46"", which still sounds fresh and refreshing, ""Sentimentalmente"", ""Attimo di Musica"".However, this album has very little in common, if anything, with what PFM was doing in the first half of the seventies. This is no prog stuff, and one has to accept this if one wants to enjoy the few good tracks on PFM?PFM!.Quality of sound is pretty good, like most everything PFM had reissued in Japan.Actually, I have been waiting for this album to be released in CD for 20+ years.Probably deserves 3 stars, but I found the previous reviewer pretty harsh, and quality of sound is truly good."
5,Magnificent...,"Miguel has given Modelers with taste for the extreme weathering not just A guide book but THE guide book for mastering these popular techniques and effects... This isn't a book to be read, it's a book to be absorbed and studied... I can't imagine the amount of work that must have went into it to produce the step by step pictures that are crystal clear and are the real treasure of the book... I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone interested in the art of model painting... WELL WORTH THE PRICE!!!Kenneth Childres"
1,Don't Buy It Drips,"Drips continually until out of water. Not just an occasional drip but empty within 2-3 hours. Have attached it to the cage in many different ways and removed the little duck that floated inside, still doesn't help .. still drip drip drip.... When I read the other reviews I ordered anyway thinking ""I've never had that problem before these people must be doing something wrong."" Nope... it drips it drips it drips... I really have no idea how a company can put something so faulty on the market but *they did* stop dripping!"
2,Not getting what you think you're getting,"When you order this variety pack, although you see three types of condoms in the picture, you have to scroll down to read that only 2 types of the condoms are what you will get (unless their is a change after I post this). I emailed the seller ([...]) to let them know. They didn't reply, and their voice mail was full. Not good. I won't order from them again. Basically, I didn't get what I thought I was ordering; False advertising with the picture of 3 types of condoms, and no customer service.As for the condoms, the Trojan Supra is way too small. So, if you have a tiny penis, you will love these. The Lifestyles Skyn fits well. Seems a bit thicker compared to regular condoms, but not bad. As for the NaturLamb, pictured in their ad? They were never sent...hence false advertising. I did get 12 condoms, which is what I ordered."
3,T H Wedge boots,"I love the boots even though they tend to make my ankles hurt if worn too long. There is very little freedom of movement from the ankle to the foot (I think due to the wedge heel). But, they look great with jeans and every time I've worn them I've gotten lots of compliments, even from complete strangers."
5,Awesome!! CD!!,I purchased this because of hearing some of the songs played on the radio!! I've wanted to get a cd of theirs for a long time because of their previous projects!!! I know they're an inspiring and committed band because their song(s) have been on WOW cd's before!!! I highly recommend this if you need a reminder of God's constant care and love!!!
4,Solid Rock Worship Album,"Building 429 hit the scene big with their debut single Glory Defined and their solid debut album The Space In Between Us. Their style had a bit of grunge mixed with solid worship lyrics, fitting since the band name is based on Ephesians 4:29, which is a great life verse. After much acclaim and a Dove Award for Best New Artist 2005, Building 429 came back with a somewhat more rocking Rise, with the hit song Fearless.Iris To Iris is the third and final Building 429 album on Word Records and is actually my favorite overall. The band certainly toned down and the grunge influence seems gone. This album is easily the most worship focused as evidenced by the stand-out songs Power Of Your Name, Majesty, You Carried Me and a great re-write of Grace That Is Greater. My favorite overall song is Singing Over Me, based on Zephaniah 3:17. This is a solid rock worship album and if you like Jeremy Camp, Casting Crowns or MercyMe, you should enjoy Building 429."
3,Typical of a University Book,"This book is factual, detailed, well-researched, and boring. It reads like stereo instructions. This is an encyclopedia of Reno casino opening and closing dates with a little about each one's owners. A typical University of Nevada Reno treatise of a subject that should be more exciting than anything - it's gambling and casinos for goodness sakes - how could you make that boring? Author Kling probably had much more to say before the university edited it out.Most of the information seems to be taken from newspaper clippings, so there is no flavor, just an alphabetical listing of the clubs. There are quite a few excellent photos, but of course they are all tiny, and that's sad when the book is 8x10!"
1,Reno--narrowly seen.,"Unless you are writing a book yourself about Reno, this book has little value. It is more a history of every casino ever built in the area. A huge task but of no value in the overall of how and why Reno came into being as the divorce capital of the world--and later fell to a second-rate tourist trap. A waste of my money."
5,Amazing Show!!!,"Amazing show, I loved it!!!!!! I watched all of it I jus need the rest of the Vol.s I have 1 & 2 Dubbed!Lots of Action, Drama, Romance, Fantasy and just a great mix of everything!"
3,Not Spectacular,"I used this book in a semester trigonometry course (covering Chapters 1 through 8), and the book was not the best. First of all, some lessons contained too much information and some too little. In addition, although the exercises are worthwhile, their difficulty levels differ from question to question, so there is no gradual increase in skill and difficulty. The book only provided good explanations on a couple of topics (for example, inverse trig. functions). All in all, the book is ""okay""; if you have a good instructor, you'll still learn trigonometry."
2,Disappointed,"Although it is of much help, to which the book lacks, it was disappointing to say the least. It did little to help simplify the understanding of the book; yet without it, one is much worse. If one needs to take trigonometry, this book will attempt to help, but lacks in great assistance."
4,A must for trig book user,Solutions manuals are good companions for text books in math can't miss adds value at resale.
3,there are better gates out there,"we've purchased another gate in the past and was better than this one (wish i had remembered the model of that one). we bought two for our new place.the construction is sturdy, but if you use the pressure mounts, it can be unsafe. plus, the mechanism for closing the gate requiring a lift and slide is cumbersome and scratches up the product. the lock mechanism is standard.the extensions purchased separately work well."
4,Tiki time!,I'm obsessed with all things Tiki and these glasses are adorable. They come with personalized recipes on the box for each of the Tiki God's personality. They're the perfect size for tiki drinks and are incredibl sturdy.
4,Wish was cheaper.,"Granddaughter loves Cheddarface. They were rather thin paperbacks, so I thought $21 was a little steep, but she'll love them."
2,"Misleading Title, Mixed Content","In purchasing this book, I had little information to guide me beforehand; I made the decision based on commentary on other works by this author, the title, and my need for information on internships in this field.I found myself greviously disappointed. While the information capsules about the employers are indeed helpful, no specifics were given for internships these employers might or might not offer. Instead, the contents of the book (aside from some prefatory material providing poor advice about resumes and cover letters) act as a directory to employers. While I am not discounting the helpfulness of such a directory, the misleading title and the quality of the prefatory material leave this reader with a very low opinion the party responsible for misleadingly marketing this volume."
2,Old school,"The pen claims to have three functions: ink pen, .07 mm pencil, and a stylus; however there is no way to choose which one you want. There is no switch and the barrel does not rotate so it's ""luck of the click"". Additionally, it has an ""old school"" stylus and does not work on any of the newer gadgets I now own (i.e. nook, I- pad, etc). It is basically useless to me."
5,great watch,this is a very good watch.. it worth for the money... the appearence is good...light weight... overall good product...
1,Do not waste your money.,This watchs' digital function stopped working after @1 month. Thought it was the battery and took to a jewler who reported battery ok because chronograph still worked. Reported would cost more in labor to figure out why digital wasn't working than watch was worth. Save your money and go with a Casio
2,WARNING!! Not Authorized by Fleetwood Mac...,"When I ordered this DVD through amazon, I had NO IDEA it would be a collection of still photos and U.K. fanclub members talking in a documentary format about the group. What you cannot see on the Amazon item description is that this is an UNAUTHORIZED release meaning no video clips or audio sound bites of the band.The Peter Green era of the 1960's at least had former band members talking about their experience with the group. But if you are a Buckingham-Nicks era fan you will be in for a big disappointment. I thought this DVD would have rare clips from the Mac's midnight special appearance etc. Instead, you get some geeky kids putting ""their spin"" on what the band was all about.My advice would be to save your money and hope ""an authorized documentary will be released in the future."
3,Mostly Good,I enjoyed the book for the most part....however the story line was predictable and there was too much filthy language.
2,Bought 2 and 1 was bad,Bought 2 of these for 15.00 a piece and the first one did not work. Had to swap it for the second one which did work. It was not an easy change out due to the location of the cylinder but the auto parts store wanted 50+ dollars for one so I guess I came out ahead. The problem is I do not have a spare for the next time now. Had to wait a full seven days to recieve.
2,Broken box means near ruined valentine's,The package came in far worse condition then describe the disc was scratched and the box was held together by the paper I had to find a dvd box and put the disc in there to give it as a gift. very disappointed. We haven't even watched it yet to see if it works or not and i'm not holding my breath.
2,They Have the Shakes,"This movie is unwatchable. Most of it takes place at night, and it is shot in low-key lighting that reveals very little. All of it is shot with a handheld camera operated, it seems, by someone with a motor-neuron ailment. There is no such thing as a steady shot in this film.Get a tripod, guys."
1,"Movie Would have been great, If You Could have seen it.","This movie, could have been amazing, if they would have used some lights. The movie is Pitch Black Start to Finish. I Actually turned it off close to the end, because i got tired of hearing screams, but not seeing the people screaming! the movie Had a great Plot, and would have been Very Intresting, If they would Had some better camera work, and some lights! This makes me so Mad, because i would have really enjoyed the film, if it werent for the Pitch, Utter Darkness. Epic Fail. I would love to see this movie Re Made, with Light!"
5,Wonderful Toys,"Our 6 month old loves his toys, and so far I have not found any problems with them. Every toy is different and he likes to play with them all. We have used little fish and turtle for his bath time and he laughed while I was showing him what they did. Right now this is all the toys he has and they are so wonderful for his age."
3,VERY guilty pleasure,"Originally shot for theatrical release, then shunted directly to video (and that in the clearance bins), ""Repli-Kate"" is a surprisingly entertaining movie. Taken on its own terms (essentially a very vulgar ""Weird Science"" meets Maxim magazine, it's not for the easily offended), it's occasionally laugh-out-loud hilarious.Its 1980s-style drawbacks can be severe. For example, the monumentally bad ending illustrates that jokes without storytelling results in an aimless ""Gotta wrap this thing up"" feeling. But I've seen worse make it to theaters and into the $100 million club. They may as well have given this a chance.In a pleasant case of violated expectations, relative newcomer Ali Landry is the funniest person in the movie. She's not only stunningly beautiful head to toe (Hormone check: Lots of skimpy lingerie but no real nudity) but also a sharper, more natural actress than other models. She is relaxed and gets the jokes."
3,"Good, Natural","I bought these after getting addicted to the Honees Honey candy, I prefer the plain Honey over the Milk and Honey, but these are ok."
4,Very Sturdy,"I bought this bag and it's very durable. The only complaint was that the strap was a little long, and I'm kinda small, but I shortened it myself, and now it fits on me perfect. I've used it to help move very heavy things when I moved, and not a problem."
3,Good But pretty Tame,"I saw nothing in this Film that should of merited any sort Banning. In fact, I think for Kids, It might be a bit on the ""slow side"" of things for thier enjoyment, but as a adult, I most definatally appreciatted this film. I thoroughly enjoyed Anna's Charector as a Slave girl. I would tend to reccomend this for Serious Anna May Wong Fans and completists only. I Liked ""Daughter of a Dragon Much More So, or Piccadilly is an another Film I'd Reccomend. The Anna May Wong Bio and Gallery contained on this DVD makes it a Must for the Collector."
2,"Why Guardian, WHY?","Guardian is my absolute favorite band, but what were they thinking releasing this album? No offense, but it stinks. It can't compare to 'Fire & Love' or even 'Buzz'. Leave this one alone..."
3,Great protection,I have used these eye protectors for a while and they protect very well. The negative is the little rubber strap will not stay connected to the side of the eye cup.
5,Great Read,"After reading Haynes' The Full Matilda, I was left just that - full. The author manages to capture all the humanity and quirky personas of his characters with humor but with generosity and realism, so that the book is not merely ""funny,"" it is satisfying. You see all sides of the characters, not just their quirkiness or comedy. Just as Matilda's full range of emotions is tapped, so is the reader's, and the writing is engaging from first page to last. One of those books you're sorry to see end. Read it."
3,More like a used/older book,"Item said new and pages had the old/worn look. Had looked for this version before and finally found it, so was a little disappointed."
2,Loggins Lost It With Vox...,"I tried to think of at least one good reason not to depart with this album; I couldn't ! The only reason I purchased the album in the first place was the song Love Will Follow containing some very soothing and soulful Fairlight synthesizer work as well as silky background vocals from singer/songstress Marilyn Martin.The only minor irritable detail of the song is Loggin's falsetto style.Also, the credits included everyone from The Pointer Sisters, Sheila E., to various DeBarge family members (talk about an 80's pop music ensemble that read like a who's who list). Most of these cast members gave the album an almost We Are the World feel to it (ironically these are some of the same artists who indeed performed on the We Are the World album back in 1985) ! I , too, agree with other reviewers who have commented on the album being a commercial overkill..."
4,Very good but...,"Currently I'm on the sixth chapter of this book and so far so good. For those who are pursuing CompTIA's Linux+ certification I believe, according to CompTIA, that this book will provide all the help and resources that you need to pass the exam. One qualm though, grammatical errors and a few incorrect verbage.It would have been best that they were omitted. The author uses,""however,"" and, ""though,"" so much and incorrectly that it makes reading difficult and not very enjoyable. So far I believe his, ""however,"" means, ""for example,"" you can try that and see if it helps, I have not figured out, ""though"" as yet. ""However,"" if you can get around these quirks, then you'll be rewarded to know that this book is complete for the Linux+ certification and very informative, ""though."""
5,Great daily facial cream with aeromatherapy scent for men,I've used this cream since 2003 and nothing I've found compares to this great product. La Thérapie Crème Hydrathérapie has been an excellent daily facial cream that has a great aeromatherapy scent that is suttle and great for men as well as women use. Highly recommend.
5,Texasville all the folks from The Last Picture Show all grown up,love it. before or after you watch it be sure to watch The Last Picture Show. Duane is all grown up & wrestling with life.
4,Excellent conversation starter and guide,"I've had this book for several years, and tried to interest my parents and in-laws in it. Their interest was only marginal. But I recently used the book to help me with interviewing my father-in-law. I used a video camera to record the event so that I didn't need to write during the interview (the book is designed as a workbook to be filled out), and worked through the questions in the book. While some of the questions seemed silly at first (what clothing did you wear as a child), they actually helped us to explore some interesting topics (his mother was good at sewing, and made knickers for him!).So, I can heartily recommend this book as a guide to interviewing your ancestors/relatives. Be forewarned: it takes quite a long time to do the interviewing, so don't wait until your relative is on his or her deathbed."
3,PalmModem Connectivity Kit in question.,"To use the Palm Modem you have to belong or sign up for unlimited service to: AT&T, Compuserve, Earthlink, PSINet or if networked at work, Unix Verio Windows NT RAS server.When connecting to the Avantgo.com, the modem will sync to the site for just download enough informtion for the e-mails or web site. It appears in order to go to another web clipping, the modem has to re-connect, which seems like a hassle.However, for limited internet usage, and could also be used for stock market symbols, the modem will connect to the web clipping and then shut off.The modem has limited uses and is only a land line with no wireless use. The modem also uses 2 tripple A batteries, without recharable option."
1,Sets the feminist movement back about 50 years,"Macho renegades and whiny women fill this book. There is no character in the book worth admiring. You can call this a novel all you want, but McKenna just writes one prolonged porno scene after another. The sexual stamina McKenna gives these men and women is past believable into the realm of insulting. I hope she uses a pseudonym so her friends and family don't know she wrote this."
1,DO NOT BUY,"This product is garbage, I did not have a problem with the audio like other users have, I just did not get any video. I installed it on two different computers an had the same problem. It just does not work. I called tech support and after waiting 15 mins for support, the tech guy was a moron. After he had me reinstalled drivers and unplugged all my USB devies, ect, he still couldnt get it to work. WHen I told him I live in Germany, he told me I had to call the HQ Germany office and that I had the US Drivers (even though the drivers on the German page are the same as on the US page, I only called the US helpline because they speak english, which by the wasy, was not toll free.) Anyways, if it worked, it would probabily be a great product. But, it doesn't work. If you do buy this produact after reading all these reviews, expect to return it, asI am tomorrow."
3,Great and then okay,When I first bought this bed I was in heaven. The height and the comfort was perfect. This is a temp bed that I had used for a month while my husband recovered from surgery. The air mattress started to get really strange bubbles in the mattress and the then massive air leaks. So great for the first few weeks and now I am looking so another bed.
3,Rent - Don't Buy,"I love Ghost Recon (all of them) and Rainbow 6 (orignal) but this game is just --- well it would be a C+ if i wasn't expecting a game comparable to previous titles but its not so its more like a C- The difference amoung guns are lame, some guns are so stupid (gernade luncher) they are just there to advertise how many guns are available. Number of orders to assign is weak, strategy is non exisiting making it a full run and gun game. The only thing 'cool' is the sniping aspect which made the game get 3 stars not 2. All that i'm going to say though is rent the game."
3,What happened?,"I am a huge fan of the Rainbow Six games! I had Rainbow Six 3 and Rainbox Six 3 Black Arrow for X Box but I got this one for PS2 because I didnt want to pay for XBox Live. Well anyway, the graphics are really horrible, good movies, horrible gameplay compared to the xbox. I hate the menu screens also, it seems like a super nintendo game! Also in this one there is a lock on thing that shows your enemies, there is no Captain giving you orders in your missions, you have to see your gun through your goggles which is retarded. Im going to personally rent this for Xbox and see if its better. If it is Im going to sell my PS2 version and buy a used Xbox one. If you loved Rainbow Six Black Arrow you'll hate this."
1,It melted,"the first time I used it, it melted into my pancakes when it touched the griddle. I also bought a Calphalon turner that worked perfectly, what a difference."
4,old biker needs a laff,"onley seen first part , bloody good sofar , recon the rest will be a screem . and box set is dam good value"
2,Not good - by comparison,I think my problem with the series is that I read the Graphic Novels first. The graphic novels are top notch with great art and a great story that has a lot of action and flows really well. The G.N.'s also manage a wide emotional range that is not diminished by the humor.The animation seems childish by comparison. It starts I guess in the middle of the graphic novels and doesn't even bother to follow the story line. It goes its own way with people from other dimensions and battle with dragons and such. The characters are 2 dimensional (pardon the pun) with no real emotional depth being created. Most of the events seem to be directed at a younger crowd (like kids).As I recall the music wasn't bad.
2,Kept waiting for it to get better,"After reading the laudatory reviews on Amazon I decided to give this book a read. I was hoping for a fun, witty, and engaging page-turner. This satisfied none of those requirements. I did get within 20 pages of the end, but gave up there because I just didn't care how it ended. The only reason I didn't give it 1 star was because I made it through most of the book.This book has a poorly designed, unbelievable plot that is strung together with one-dimensional characters. If you're looking for a good read, look elsewhere."
4,Travel Charger works great with m515,"I bought this travel charger for two reasons. One we wereheading to Scandanavia (Sweden, Denmark, Netherlands) and Belgium. This device worked flawlessly everywhere we went.I was able to use my palm while on vacation (reading Ebooksor playing games during down time). I didn't have to worryabout losing my charge.The second reason was to have an additional method to chargemy palm at home. I keep my USB cradle at work. Ratherthan buy a second USB cradle for home, I got the travel chargerand a serial sync cable (they were sold out of USB sync cablesas the time).I don't have any complaints about this charger. The carry bagis nice. The charger works well, and takes up very little space(will fit inside a shoe to save travel space). I don't have a problem with the connector. Once you get the hang of it.. its fine."
2,hard to get replacement parts for,We bought the slide in June. Two weeks later one of the hoses came loose and broke. Have contacted manufacturer and nothing. Called & emailed twice. Nothing. Replacement parts are very hard to come by. Buyer beware.
4,Latest info on this slide,"I e-mailed customer service at toyquest the week of April 17th 2005 or thereabouts. This was my email and the reply that they sent.Comments=Has the six flags banzai falls water slide been redesigned. Theamazon.com reviews of last summer savaged the product so I did't buy onethen. I just saw a flyer in this past sunday's paper from walmart whichhad the slide again for sale. I just don't want to buy the thing use itfor 3 hours and have the seams rip and foot steps come apart. Pleaseadvise if it has been redesigned and then you'll get my money.Thank you, DanTheir reply cut and pasted from my e-mail.Dan,Yes, the slide has been redesigned. It now says 'new and improved' on thebox. It has been made with a more durable material and since redesigning itwe have not have any of the problems from the old slide.Have a great day!LeahToyQuest Supervisor1-800-434-6178Hopefully amazon.com/toy-r-us will begin to carry these again.Regards, Duckworth"
2,not worth it,"the first week was great. the second week, i noticed that the slide was not as sturdy as the week prior. i started looking closely, there were at least 20 holes in the slide. the patch kit they supplied didn't even come close to covering all of the holes. i only have 2 children that use this slide, ages 6 and 7. the kids do not act wild on it, just slide down. i couldn't believe the amount of holes. i would not recommend this slide. not for the price they're selling it. maybe for $20 at a garage sale......."
2,Bonzai water slide,"As other people have commented, the seams started leaking after only two days of use. Toyquest promptly sent a new one which did the same thing. They are sending a third one although they tell me it is against their policy to replace a replacement. I wish I knew if I received an old defective slide both times or if the new slides are poorly constructed also. Can anyone who has had good luck with the durability tell me if the water falls onto the slide from the top or from the side? Mine comes from the top and I'm wondering if it is an old model. Also the box DID NOT say new and improved even though I bought it in May 2005. [...]"
5,wow great summer activity,"This super fun and cool slide has made my kids the envy of the neighborhood I bought it for my 3 kids ages 3,4and 10 and I also use it as a treat for the daycare kids on hot days the only problem we had was when we first set it up the tube that you attach to the hose burst the very first time we tried to use it but since I bought it for my sons birthday party I didn't return it and decided to just keep the hose on low in the pool area no big deal the fun and excersize alone was worth every cent I even get up there and slide down the kids love this and I love that they would rather play on this than their playstation..."
3,"FUN, but a lot of WORK too.","This slide is tons of fun for little ones once it's inflated, in place, and ready to go. No denying that! But be prepared for the time it take to set it up, and be sure you have some muscle help too. The bags that stabilizes the slide weight a ton once they are filled with water (which is good for the stabilization issue, just heavy to move). The slide itself is stable, durable, and great for kids 6 and under. Adult CAN use this slide, but the weight of an adult makes the landing a bit rough. There is no 'padding' except water at the bottom, so it can hurt a bit when your butt meet the ground. A few inches of water is all you need for a chid, and they land perfectly!For the price, this IS a great slide, and it has held up for more than one season. It's just not the one you want if you don't have someone stronger helping you set up and disassemble, it can be exhausting for one person."
3,Great for only a little while.,"I have two kids under 11 years. They were thrilled when we bought this water slide. It's a great concept, especially if you don't have enough space in your yard to put a pool. It was pretty easy to set up. However, the kids went down it about 4 or 5 times and the seams ripped. The seam where the hose hooks up to it came apart. (...). We took it back to the store and exchanged it for another one. Guess what... That one came apart at the seams too. This was incredibly frustrating. Like I said, it's a great concept. It just needs to be constructed better."
2,great fun if they could get it right!,we got the newer slide without all of the seam problems. it was great for about a month then all of the sudden it got a hole under neath the nylon at the end of the slide. then it ended up ripping there because of the force of the kids coming down. other neighbors had the same problem. THE SLIDE NEEDS TO BE LONGER! the end of the slide cannot take the force of the kids coming down the slide.maybe in the next ten tries they'll get it right while everyone keeps forking over money for poorly made slide. it should've been done right the first time for how much money they cost!
2,Great Fun But Doesnt Hold Up,We purchased this slide last summer the kids had a blast on it. We got it out this summer to use again and like everyone else we had problems with the seems spliting (we purchesed the model that said new and improved on the side of the box YA RIGHT). I called the comapany to let them know my concerns and he told me that it was past 60 days so he couldn't help me with the situation and that was after he lied and said that at first he couldnt find the product in his computer then he tried to tell me that the product was 3 years old when on the box its states its from 2006 the slide was $299.00 and i just want to let others know that its a poor quality product and the the company doesnt help or stand beside the product they sell.
1,HORRIBLE!,Slide collapses when climbed on only after few hours of use by my 8 year old who is 64 lbs and my 9 year old who is 67 lbs. This slide has already developed lots and lots of holes everywhere and snags on the lower part allowing the air to escape causing it to deflate. VERY VERY BAD CHOICE FOR A DURABLE WATER SLIDE! Come to find out the manufacturer does not even make this one any longer. There are lots of warnings printed all over the slide not allowing you to return it to the store where you bought instead you have to call the 800# also all over the slide to file a complaint. They are sending me another slide of equal value and size lets see how this one works out. I will keep you posted. by the way it just purchased this 3 days ago and used it only a few hours.when it started having problems.
5,m130 serial cradle,Can't review this as I ordered a serial connection instead od a USB connection The company has been a tremendous help to me and has sent me a replacement USB one free of charge
2,"Nice book, but.....","This book is great for the subject it covers. Yet, the price tag leaves plenty to be desired. I found the same text book at an on-campus bookstore for only $2 more (in hardcover edition) than the one being offered here. Where are the savings? [ the 2 star rating is due to the price ]"
4,Great for watering trees and newly planted bushes,"I have several of these to water trees and bushes to get them established and for the periodic watering needed (to avoid shallow roots if a drip irrigation system is used.) Yes these have a tendency to break from banging around but all you have to do is go to Home Depot or Lowes and get some JB Weld ofr metal, mix some up, apply at the joint and around the hose adapter base and it is stronger than ever. These are hard to find locally but necessary for quick deep watering while preventing erosion from a full force hose."
2,Disappointing but real bits stitched together,"I was hoping for actual, professional burlesque acts of several minutes each. Instead, these were dozens of acts consisting of 10 seconds to a few minutes. Most of them were just quick strips to bra, pasties or breasts. Only a few of them seemed professional and entertaining. A few of them were depressing to look at. I even fast-forwarded through many because they were so bad.At best, it's a well-preserved piece of history. Also, it's an interesting glimpse into how women were oppressed to empowered (looking at their faces and acts) by participating in burlesque...or how burlesque could be interpreted as an artform (by those in it) to a self-shaming act of quick stripping (many looked embarrassed, while only a few looked to be enjoying and performing well). Enjoy? Not so much."
1,Only useful if you've seen absolutely everything else in Louisiana,"There are some truly oddball items in this book that may be of interest to some people, but for tourists that have never or seldom been to Louisiana they should look to other books."
1,Commercial Grade Really?,"I bought this hose from Deerso through Amazon. I had decided that when I needed a new hose, I was going to get something heavier than those lighter grades that had failed just too often. What a mistake the Swan Commercial was! I have never had a hose that kinked every single time that I changed direction but the Swan Commercial does this without fail! On top of that, it weighs twice as much as the typical homeowner-grade garden hose. What does it provide for its hefty price? Nothing, absolutely nothing! Learn from my mistake!"
4,Great boot,"I've owned a pair of these boots before, great boots! I would have given these boots a five star rating but they were a little smaller in size compared to my previous pair. After wearing these boots for a couple of weeks they have become very comfrontable. The boots I ordered are a beautiful black onyx well made pleasure to wear possibly a four and one half star."
3,Not for Backpacking,"I bought this bag for a backpacking trip last winter. I was attracted to the low price, and 0 degree rating. This bag is big and heavy. I have a 90L backpack, which is one of the larger ones they make, and this sleeping bag took up half of the backpack. The first night, got down to about 30 degrees. I was cold. The second night was about the same. That night, I got into the bag with my thermals, jacket. and wool cap, and I was fairly warm. I think the temperature rating is way off. You'll be comfortable down to about 30 degrees, if you're wearing a jacket inside the bag.Pros-Low PriceCons-HeavyTakes up way too much room in a backpackTemperature rating is not accurateIf you are using it for car camping, it might work. But don't get it for a backpacking trip. I would give it less than 3 stars, but it's partially my fault for not realizing beforehand how big this bag is."
2,Not same design or color as pictured,"There were many zero-degree bags to choose from. We chose this one because my 9-year-old like the color and design. Unfortunately, it arrived in a drab green and brownish color. Probably not a big deal for most, however, it was quite a disappointment to my son who did not receive what he chose for his birthday (looks nothing like picture).This is probably a very functional bag - just be prepared for a different color/look."
4,VERY CONFINING,"IF YOU ARE OF THE MORE ROTUND PERSUASION, DO NOT BUY A MUMMY BAG. IT DID KEEP ME VERY WARM IN 17 DEGREE WEATHER BUT IT WAS UNCOMFORTABLE BECAUSE IT WAS TO CONFINING."
3,Really it's Jason takes a boat.,"Trying to inject more new blood into the dying series, this entry had the once again resurrected serial killer jump a small cruise ship taking the Crystal Lake High graduating class to New York, New York. He then starts killing the brats off one by one.Writer/director Rob Hedden brings some sarcastic humor to his by the numbers script (a boxing match between a student and Jason has a nice punchline - get it?), but it is his direction that really keeps the movie slightly above average. The departure works more often than it doesn't, but nothing came of it. This was the last true blue Friday the 13th movie, followed by the non-related non-seqeul/remake of 'The Hidden' Jason Goes to Hell. Take it home, you might enjoy it."
2,YAWWWWWN!,"Okay. The story starts off with Jason coming out of the ocean he was buried in and getting on a cruise ship where he slashes half the crew into oblivion. A few of the crew members escape on a canoe where they make it to Manhattan. Even though the kills are okay, the movie is so slow paced that the kills hardly break the spell of tedium that the movie has cast on you. I'll admit that the part where Jason knocked the guy's head off was pretty funny. The part where he got caught by the toxic waste in the sewer was pretty funny too. He sounded like a deer that just got hit by an oncoming car. lol. The acting is hohum as well as the the pace of the movie and for a horror film so bland its longer than it needs to be. This is not the worst of the Friday The 13th series but it's one of the worst. If you are looking for a godd Friday The 13th flick look elsewhere. If you are looking for something to cure those sleepless nights then this movie is perfect for you."
3,Really dumb...,"I can understand why Paramount Pictures didnt want to continue the franchise after this movie. The very first scenes is located at Camp Crystal Lake, are good. Then for the most of the movie, the plot mostly is located aboard a teen filled ""love-boat"" headed for New York. The best parts of the movie is the endings, where the plot is located in New York, but it only lasts for about 15-20 minuttes. This movie could have been neat (if it wasent for the boring boat part)."
2,Worst Friday,"This film has an incoherent plot seemingly unrelated to any of the previous Fridays. It is mindless, and not in the humorous way that you might find in some other ""bad"" horror movies. It is just a dull sort of mindlessness. The movie is not so bad to be unwatchable, but it's still a waste of time."
1,makes no sense,"this movie makes no sense and is not even a little scary. the actors are bad, the story is bad, kane hodder needs to hang it up as jason and find someone with passion. the writer and director dont know what they are doing. i laughed through the whole movie and was not scared one time, can anyone in hollywood write anymore? watch part 3 for the good old real jason."
1,Worst Of The Bunch!!!,"This is by far the absolute worst in the series! There is nothing funny, the acting is proably some of the most terrible in cinema history and the special effects suck!!!"
2,THE TITLE IS A CHEAT [UNTIL THE END],"THIS SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTING AND LESS BLOODY ENTRY, HAS JASON ON A BOAT MURDERING TEENS AND THE FILM IS NOT IN MANHATTAN UNTIL THE END AND THAT IS ALL, IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN MANHATTAN FOR THE WHOLE TIME IT WOULD HAVE BEEN COOL TO SEE JASON IN HOTELS,TOY STORES.BUT THIS FILM DESERVES SOME CREDIT FOR THE END BECAUSE JASON CHASES RENNIE AND SEAN IN TRAINS,A RESTAURANT,SEWERS,AND THEN HE DIES.NOT MUCH FUN LIKE PART 6."
3,"""Not That Bad!""","Kane Hodder and Jensen Daggett star in this 1989 horror sequel.Slasher, Jason Voorhees terrorizes a ship on the way to NewYork. This sequel isn't that bad and I give it credit for trying.One of the problems is it's called ""Jason takes Manhattan"" andhe's not there very long. Most of the film was shot in Vancouverand if it had more of him in New York, it may have helped. Thisdvd has nice picture and sound plus some neat extras. I stillrecommend this."
5,Great Deluxe Edition!!,"This is one of the best in the series and finally it has gone to something different besides Crystal Lake for once. Great Extra Features. I recommend this one to everyone.First on a cruise ship packed with teens heading to Manhattan, then in the Big Apple itself, Jason Voorhees returns to continue his bloody slicing and dicing ways--even below ground on a packed subway train. New Yorkers, who claim to have seen it all, have never seen anything like Jason!"
2,JASON ON VACATION!? MISLEADING TITLE!,"I am writing reviews for each of the Friday the 13th, but I own the box set and the older releases of the later two. The reviews are for those editions not the newer deluxe editions.What could have been an interesting entry in the series is one of the worst installments. The title is very misleading as Jason is only in ""The Big Apple"" for the last few minutes. With so many of the films taking place in the woods, it could have been a breath of fresh air to have Jason in Manhattan for most of the film. Regardless, this film is so bad, it's hysterical!The DVD transfer is good and this is the last of the films to be included in the box set."
2,One of the worst in the Friday series,Friday the 13th part VIII is the ultimate sleeping aid. If your an insomniac and are in desperate need of sleep- watch this movie.Although i have got to admit it has got some good bits in it. I'd rather see another friday movie though.
1,1 Star is really being too kind!!!!!!,"...They have taken the ""Friday the 13th"" sequels way too far with this one. When did Jason stop slashing teenagers in Camp Crystal Lake, get on a boat, kill all the passengers, and get off in Manhattan. This movie takes stupidness to another level."
5,Great example of Whitaker's Experiential Family Systems Therapy,"Read this book for class in a master's of social work program but, once started, I wouldn't have been able to put it down anyway. Looking forward to re-reading it. Couples well with a theoretical synopsis of Experiential Family Systems Therapy."
1,What's the point?,"I have not seen this book, so, I don't really have the right to criticize it, but I am going to. You see, you can go to any Charmed website on the net, and they will come complete with a ton of ""Other sites about charmed"" links. And, you can go to Safesearching.com and look of Charmed, and get a to of sites, including the most official charmed site, Charmingworld.com"
2,Lameness,"This pretty much sucked. I liked the corpse in the laundry machine though. I thought the little love triangle they were trying to pull between Axel, TJ and Whatsherface was weak. By the way they ended the movie it was obvious that they wanted to do a sequal. Glad that didn't happen, although I would have prefered a sequal to that even lamer 1999 movie Valentine.The acting in this movie is mediocre, not great as some people think. But mediocre is a high standard for an early eighties horror movie. I didn't think this movie was ""so 80's"", it was more like ""so crappy"". It was more like a seventies horror flick than anything.P.S. I loved the comment that one of the reviewers made about not wanting to get this movie for Valentine's Day!"
5,80's horror B-movie classic complete with graphic gore,SPOILERSGreat uncut gore scenes including a dead woman tumbling in a clothes dryer and a person's skin peeking off after having his head dunked in boiling water. Good stuff!
4,Guard your heart.,Had the original on DvD..bought the remake in 3D on blu ray..couldn't pass this up..now if I could only find Sleepaway Camp that would be awesome.
3,Not the best from Fourplay,"I am a huge Fourplay fan, however this concert was lackluster at best. It had its high points over all it was very generic. I guess I was hoping that he concert was better than the CD which was the worst they have every done."
3,IHRA DRAG RACING (P2),"The Ihra drag racing game (P2)if you know about Drag racing cars and how select the right engine, tranmisson and tires this game is good for ya.It will take a long time to come up with the rightcombination to get any car to go faster then your opponet car from first playing the game. I think they sould have put sometype specification for an example."
2,Generic SuckS !!!,"The product work just fine, but i wait for a original, genuine product not generic. but what i do i need it !"
2,Breaks Quickly,"I bought 5 of these, one for each person in the house. One didn't charge ""rapid""ly. Another one I was pulling from the wall socket and the wire came right out of the plug part. Another one broke as it was being detached from the phone. These are of very cheap build. If you buy this product most likely you'll have to buy another one soon."
1,Horrible construction great costumer service,"The price for this charger is unbeatable but the quality is substandard in my opinion. I have gone through 3 chargers. The first lasted about 2 weeks, the second about 3 months and this last one about 4. The first stopped charging, but the others just fell to pieces while unplugging then (one from the phone and the other from the wall outlet). The company replaced the first 2 for free (even beyond the warranty period) and didn't charge shipping. I am not going to bother replacing this last one. When they are intact the chargers work quite well, and actually charge the phone rapidly."
1,DO NOT BUY - WORTHLESS,"The shipping speed was great...the issue is with the product. This does absolutely NOTHING in terms of creating ""HD"" quality viewing on anything other than the cardboard the product arrives in...horrible, complete waste of $. Wait for XBOX360 or PS3 if you want high-def gaming."
3,"Good value, comparable to RT314 but dissapointing enhancemts","I used it for less than a month. It replaced an Netgear RT-314 I had before. I was happy with the basic functionality of the RT-314, and I wanted to add some kind of parental control (essentially limit the hours my children could use the Internet).The RP114 is advertised as having that capability, but it is quite limited. You can only set global access hours, there is no way to target different users. I also found that both the RT-314 and RP-114 would not allow multiple VPN sessions simultaneously, and I had to reboot the router to be able to connect to ATT Net Client after my wife had connected to her company. This was a great annoyance, and I finally returned the RP114 and bought an SMC Barricade 7004-ABR. That solved the problem with VPN. And to my surprise, the Barricade has the parental controls I needed, but they are not trumpeted on the box like netgear does, plus it has a print server. All for about [price] more...."
1,Disappointed and upset by throwaway remark,"I ordered this book with high expectations and was disappointed by one very important line in the book ""The family wasn't sad anymore, because they found lots of children to adopt in Vietnam!"". How can you instill a sense of pride and self confidence in children if they feel that they were easily come by because of ""lots of children to adopt"" and what respect does that show for Vietnam and the Vietnamese people because not only are my children adopted from Vietnam, but we have Vietnamsese friends both here in Ireland and in Vietnam. I hope you print this review as I use amazon regularly and find it an excellent source of both adoption and general publications, but not this time. I wouldn't have ordered it if I had seen inside first. Thanks for reading this, Colette Gallagher, Dublin, Ireland"
3,Pretty O.K.,I liked alot of the things about this dvd. The only complaint I have is that they only show SOME clips of the movie. It would have been even better if they shown more of the movies. Everything else I think is Pretty okay.
5,What an outstanding mix!!!!!,"I'll keep this short and sweet. If you are an Imperial fan, a contemporary christian fan, or just someone who loves music, you've gotta have this set. From the Gaither days to the Russ T. days, with the Big A there the entire time, this CD has it all. What a pleasure it is to kick-back and listen to the incredible harmonies of Eagle Song and then rock-out with Power of God. Wow!!! Great finish with Not to Us. Going to order more as gifts. Enjoy......."
3,Jason resurrected,"When I first saw this movie, I thought it was extremly bad. The plot is so unbelieveably bad that I have no clue why this movie was bad. This film is about a telekintic girl brings back Jason to life. I know it sounds very chessy, but after viewing this film a few times later. Well I have to say I was entertained. You can't take this film seriously and its just another example of a 80's chessy movies. But hey, I enjoyed it and I didn't fall asleep to it. So I give this movie more like a 3.7 ."
5,awsome scary,the only scary one jason goes from little hoses to a party where he stalks and slashas a nice change not that much gore i nice change but stis pretty gor7y jason also ticks me off when he kills the moher and that shy girl with the glasses and the characters tina her boyfriend and mother plus some others make you care about them and makes you want them to kill jason jasons face in this ones disguisting just plain gross plus you can see his bones on his back
3,ONE OF THE BEST IN THE SERIES DISPITE BEING EDITED!,"I am writing reviews for each of the Friday the 13th, but I own the box set and the older releases of the later two. The reviews are for those editions not the newer deluxe editions.One of the more enjoyable entries in the series mainly because Jason has someone who can fight back! Unfortunately this film was edited to receive a R rating and the unedited version has yet to be released. It's still a fun entry in the series.The DVD transfer is very good and there are some interesting extras on the box set."
3,pretty good,"i watched the first five minutes of this and it looked pretty cheesy so i stoped it.then about a month later i decided to live through it and i dont know why,it started getting pretty scary!not the best in the series,but could be number 2 or 3.less gore in this one"
3,jason vs a telekinetic chick,"yep thats right!hes up against a telekinetic teenager.sounds like a stephen king movie or maybe freddy.a little x-men like also.no worries.from here in the series,theres manhattan,hell,space and vs freddy.this one is one of the better ones.id rank it over all of these except freddy vs jason.the chick is sexy in a way.its like that a lot in horror films.the chicks are always freaked out,covered in blood or dying so theres really little time to check them out.of course shes very upset at her authority figures who dont belive her about her talent.theyre annoying!this is one of the best jason movies!"
5,The Best!!!!!,THIS IS THE BEST ENTRY TO THE SERIES KANE HODDER FINALLY TAKES ON THE ROLE OF JASON.I WISH THAT HE HAD PLAYED JASON ALL ALONG HE IS THE BEST.ANYWAY THIS IS THE BEST SINCE PART 3 DEFINATELY WORTH OWNING.SO BUY IT NOW YOU'LL LOVE IT.
3,Worth watching.,"Some years after Part 6 of this series, Jason is still chained to the bottom of Camp Crystal Lake. That is until a girl with unusual psychic powers accidentally unchains him and he is let loose again.This film has a stunning opening sequence, a great climaxing battle, Jason at his most horrific, and an interesting plot involving psychokinesis, but said storyline is constantly playing second fiddle to the usual load of gormless, sex-mad teenagers who turn up at the lake and are killed off one by one. To make matters worse, the death scenes are very bog-standard and uninteresting compared to those in previous films. The title music is great, very sinister, but most of the incidental music throughout the film is just recycled from previous Friday 13th movies. Not a bad film, the special effects and atmosphere make it far more entertaining than the early Friday 13ths. It just could have done with a little more imagination thrown in."
2,"Friday the 13th Part 7 ""The New Blood""","This is one of the poorest Friday the 13ths ever made. There is a telekinetic girl named Tina who can make things fly and apparently make things come alive, as she does it to Jason Voorhees. This film just doesn't fit with the rest of the series, apparently the girl, Tina, used to live in Crystal Lakes, yet in none of the other Friday the 13th's do you see Tina, or hear about her father drowning, it just doesn't fit. I would still buy it to make a complete set, but not because I like it."
3,One of the series' scariest and most suspenseful.,"Lar Park Lincoln is a teenage girl with telekinetic powers who unfortunately awakens and releases Jason from his watery grave. This entry is actually one of the scariest, with lots of effective stalk-and-slash sequences, plenty of nudity, and even decent acting from Lincoln, who's probably the series' best and most likeable heroine. The climactic battle is a highly memorable showdown, and one of the series' top highlights. Could have overall had a bit more gore, however, as it does seem heavily cut in some spots.*** 1/2 out of *****"
2,lame,"what the hell have they done this movie recks the other 6 a girls who can make things happen with her mind does battle with jason. the story and the charactors of the movie sucked 1,2,6,8 of the fridays are good movies with good stories this one gets in the way i didnt believe it"
1,Worst Friday the 13th movie. That says ALOT!!,"The Friday the 13th legacy that is DEAD and buried would have a lot more credibility if this entry was never made. The new blood's predecessor JASON LIVES, was a great sequel and everybody likes part 6. The entry after The New Blood, Jason Takes Manhattan, is my personal favorite because it was the first horror movie that I saw ever and I am in love with Kelly Hu, who made her acting debut in Jason takes Manhattan. The New Blood is about Tina , a telepathic girl whose dead father saves her ass from Jason. They should have skipped from Jason Lives to Jason takes Manhattan, because this probably the worst out of all the Friday the 13th movies( JAson goes to Hell and Jason X don't vount because they aren't real Friday the 13th movies."
4,Old school jungle fun,"This is an old school, politically incorrect and cheezy treat. Dinosaurs, a white jungle lord, and cannibals. This book has it all!"
4,EXCELLENT WASHINGTON IS SUPERB,This is an excellent film and Denzel Washington gives a outstanding performance. This tense and gripping drama will have you balling your eyes out in the unforgetable climax! Nice DVD transfer.
1,No Thank Q,"Let me get this straight . . . Denzel Washington takes hostages and demands a heart transplant for his kid because he has a lousy HMO? ""John Q"" is unrealistic, full of cliche characters, and ultimately predictable. James Woods and Anne Heche are especially painful to watch in their one-note performances as the heartless heart surgeon and the ice-cold hospital administrator. ""John Q"" tries to be the ""Dog Day Afternoon"" of the health care industry, but misses the target badly."
4,"Parents, prepare to think... a lot","As an American with a newborn, this movie certainly struck a nerve. I found myself wondering hours later how well I am prepared for the financial burdens I may face should such a terrible health tragedy strike my family.The film itself may not have had such an impact were I single. It is a good drama, and certainly worth watching. There are moments when it is overly corny; and the social commentary it tries to bring across is strained at times. But the star cast performance helped keep my interest alive throughout.The value of this film is not in its entertaining qualities alone; but in the fact that it makes parents think and, hopefully, act in their communities to improve the imbalance in the social net. God bless America; but God forgive its lawmakers too."
2,Average should have Been Better,You Know Denzel Washington is a Gifted Actor when He can take a Average film like this&Make it Compelling for a while.to many cliches hurt it&alot of Good Solid Talents are given lackluster material to work with here.
2,MEDIOCRE,"A MEDIOCRE SCRIPT RECEIVES MEDIOCRE DIRECTION, AND THE WHOLE THING NEVER DESERVED SUCH A DEDICATED CAST. SURE THERE'S A PLOT, BUT IT SEEMS LIKE IT WAS DUG UP FROM THE LIFETIME MOVIE OF THE WEEK VAULT, ONLY WITH A LESS BELIEVABLE STORY. MY BIGGEST QUESTION IS, WHAT WAS MR. WASHINGTON THINKING WHEN HE SAID YES TO THIS BLAND SCREENPLAY? IT IS SO BELOW HIS TALENTS AS AN ACTOR THAT I WOULDN'T KNOW WHERE TO BEGIN. MY POINT IS NO MATTER HOW MUCH I WANTED ""JOHN Q"" TO BE SOMETHING ELSE, IT SIMPLY ISN'T. AND I'M SORRY THAT I THINK IT TAKES MORE THAN A FEW ACTION SCENES AND A TOP-NOTCH PERFORMANCE FROM DENZEL WASHINGTON TO MAKE A MOVIE A WINNER."
3,good acting/poor writing,"Denzel Washington does a great job, Daniel E Smith plays his part very well. They are what pulls the movie UP to 3 stars.The writer of this movie over-dramatizes problems with the healthcare industry in the US. The hospital director is this tough woman who couldn't care less about patients. Doctors and rich people are made out to be evil. Then you throw in the young police chief who tries to be smarter than the older cop.I felt like someone took what could have been a good story and made sure to add in as many politically correct, socialist storylines as possible. Where's Senator McCarthy when we need him?"
2,Problematic,"Pros:Looks niceHelpful customer serviceEasy to useWorked perfectly for over a year.Cons:Leaks at the faucet tip. Right now mine is leaking a drop a second. Have had it for probably 3 years.The water pressure is low (still usable).Customer service was helpful in telling how to take it apart and readjust, but periodically having to do that seems to have increased the problem to the point to that it leaks constantly."
5,Better than I expected,"When I ordered this kit I never expected it to look so good and the functionality is great. No more pulling buttons on the faucet and making sure it's not hot water coming through.Just surprised that it comes with all the parts you need, including a new filter holder. Frankly it's not a conversion kit but it's the complete deal minus a filter. Anyone want to buy my old counter-top parts? ;-)"
3,Plan to buy a new one every year,"I have had several of these. I leave mine on my plow truck year-round and only ever get one season out of them. It seems that after sitting for that length of time, the motor isn't powerful enough to spin the light. I've tried everything and have come to the conclusion that it's a disposable item that needs to be replaced every year. You get what you pay for with this one. I'm getting something different this year though."
3,"Serves what I wanted it for, but received with the lens broken","I bought this as a side of the road emergency signal, as I travel frequently. But was disappointed that the lens was received cracked. Guess that's what to expect for 56% off with 4 left in stock."
2,Magnet is too weak and cord is too tough,"Two major issues:+ Magnet is too weak.+ Coiled cord has too much tension and is nearly impossible to run in a convenient fashion.Because the tension in the coiled power cord is so great, it creates pull on the light, to the point where it can overpower the magnet and drag it a bit. Nearly impossible to place on the center of your roof.I had it off to the side close to the door. Ran the cable to the cigg lighter, without much tension. At 70mph, the power of the magnet failed, and it became detached from my roof and was dangling outside my car. In doing so, it's yellow case cracked.This product is great if you intend to drive around a parking lot. But if you plan to actually use it for public service where you may have to race to a position in your vehicle, then this thing blows and is a fail."
2,Incomplete; Very Frustrating,"As a student in my third semester of Arabic, I purchased this answer key to help me through some of the advanced Arabic grammar. There are a few mistakes, the book does not account for alternative answers on fill-in-the-blank vocab, and worst of all, it's incomplete. I struggle the most with the listening exercises, but this answer key does not give sample answers for ANY of the short answer questions in the book. It skips over several exercises every chapter, and is extremely frustrating to me as a student. Some of the stories are dictated in the book, but some are not. I found this answer key highly unreliable for the exercises I needed to complete for class."
3,Hey y'all- listen up!,"Okay. Bare in mind this movie has nothing to do with the first chud. No characters, genre (This is comedy) and no tone. Still, for a callback to the late eighties, this rocks. Fans of the video game 'zombies' will notice similarties. This movie is like ""encino man"" crossed with """"Return of the living dead 3"" Also, if this is the same as the tv version, look out for robert englund, with freddy makeup, as a soldier! Muchos laffterr. sincerely the goremeister..."
3,funny in a sick way,"It has a good plot which is kinda unusual for a comedy horror film. This movie is funny for those with a sick humor but in a silly way. It is about a C.H.U.D. falling in love, it just chills the heart."
5,Hit of the Party & Very Quiet,"It was worth paying $20 more to get the Sephra name brand. I read reviews of other $40-50 chocolate fountains, and they all said how noisy they were. I paid $70 & got free shipping through Amazon. This unit is very quiet, and some people couldn't even tell there was a noise. It worked perfectly!!"
2,Hmmm...,"This was wierd... Too many things going on. Akasha wasn't really in the movie at all. For as long as she was in the movie, and for what she did, I don't think that what she did was bad enough for everybody to want to kill her. And seriously, she's the Almighty Akasha, and what; they kill her in like 5 minuts?....Okay. And then there's the crapy special affects, when they're flying around. It really amused me. Over all it was...ehh, I guess OKAY. But only because Lestat's a big hunky hunk!"
2,50/50 read the books if you have the time,"it probly deserves 3 stars, and i really liek the movie since only 2 of them come from Rice's many books. But the movie is way way wrong, Marius my favorite has long blonde hair and is much younger than the old guy with short black hair in the movie, i actually didn't recognize him as marius, who could?also most of the other characters were unbefitting of the roll int he book. They could ahve stuck with brad pitt and the other guy rather than make a whole new look, though aliah did a very good job as the queen. The kign and queen werent very good either, they look like statues but they are not, and after riseing they are still paper white, somehow akasha got a ""tan"".The movie is good but the books are much better if you liked the movie you may have foudn a hobby."
1,...,I advise you not to see this movie. You want to see a good vampire movie with and all star cast. get Bram stoker's dracula the story is good and it lives up to the original novel than any other version. Gary oldman gives an outstanding performance as Dracula. The special effects are excellant and once you start to watch it you get hooked very easily. Anthony hopkins plays the opposite side to dracula. Francis Ford Coppola knew what he was doing.
2,blah,"i am a big fan of the vampire cronicles and all of Anne Rices work. Interview With The VAmpire had to be one of my most favorite movies. When i heard that Queen Of The Damned was coming out i got very excited. I was extremly upset whan i saw who was casted. I thought Tom Cruise did a superb job as Lestat.He made Lestat come to life for me. Stuart Townsend killed that image. His hair was too dark, his accent funny, and he was nothing like the tom lestat. Armand (who wasn't even introduced)was short ,chubby, and had very short curly blonde hair, nothing like the armand in IWTV. it was like the just made the movie, didnt bother to read the books more than once and completely forgot about TWTV. i enjoyed some of the effects, and the music wasnt bad. i saw it twice and maybe will rent it but it deffinatly isnt of the same calibur as IWTV."
2,If you read the book you will not like the movie,I read the book before I saw the movie in the theater and the movie is almost nothing like the book. The only thing that was the same was the characters names. The movie was simplefied so every one will understand the movie and left major parts of the book out.
4,A good Friday night popcorn movie,"This movie wasn't that great but it was fun to watch. It was entertaining. And that's good enough for me. But more then half the entertainment goes to Lestat (Stuart Townsend) whom I had my eyes glued on through out the entire movie. (so hot) Although I liked Interview way better, I thought Stuart played a better Lestat. I think with this movie, they were trying to get to the younger 13 year old audiences rather than adults. They tried to make it more popular it seems and more into the trendy vampires rather then the classics. ... But the soundtrack is awesome! Watch it."
1,The worst adaptation ever made,"To anyone who has read the book, this will be a great disapointment. The entire plotline is wrecked from the romance between Jesse and Lestat, to the childish-ness of Pandora.The movie has lost all of the elegance and charm given to it by the chronicles and the first movie. If you want a good storyline with intriguing characters- Stick to the books. If you want another teen flick- see the movie.The only reason I gave this movie 1 star was because of the soundtrack, and a few cute guys with their shirts off."
3,Good quality but lacking,It wasn't faithful enough to the book the cast was excellent especially Aaliyah as the dark queen of vampires from the moment she arrived.It was good but it missed out the big and small things for example the red haired vampire has a twin which in the book is quite important.I found this film of high-quality with a first-class cast the camera angles are good the plot as well but again the book is superior.
1,"If you've read the chronicles, DON'T WATCH THIS","The movie totally destroys the beautiful books Rice has written. First of all Lestat is blond, not black-haired. Magnus made Lestat, not Marius. Jesse is much older. Louis is missing. Lestat adopts the violin from his friend, Nicolas, not some woman he sees at a campfire. Lestat does not kill just the young, he kills the evil-doer. The producer must have seen or read Interview and made Lestat as Louis saw him. If you haven't read the books and you are a moron who is looking for action (things that go boom), half-naked women, and bad guys, then buy the movie. If you expect a shade of art in films or prefer books over movies, DON'T WATCH THIS. You'll become dumber."
2,bad movie,"i thought this movie was awful mrs rice didn,t interview with the vampire because tom curise was in this one but her fans like i did too i think this was pretty bad (josh heartnett) was give the role after tom curise deline then heartnett also deline mrs townsned took it up this is differnet than interview for one it,s does not have a all star cast this movie has minor actors in this movie some you people why was aaliyah chossen for this role aaliyah was chossen for this role because she wasn,t a major star i agree on two things this movie dishonor this books (vampire lesat) and (Queen of Damned) i read boths novels since it was eight years later years a differnet cast needed was can understand why none of the cast for interview with the vampire are in this movie meagan good would a better choice than aaliyah read the books"
2,it is all rights,This movie was not really based on Aaliyah she only had a few scenes in this movie. I was really dissapointed because they made it seem like aaliyah was the star of the movie well she wasn't that other girl was. BY THE WAY I LOVE GIRL. REST IN THE PEACE.
4,Could've been better,"If you haven't read Anne Rice's ""The Vampire Lestat"" or Queen of the Damned"", then this movie would be great. If you did read them then you and I both know that this movie was totally botched up. I mean, come on, Magnus made Lestat not Marius. And what's with the character choices anyways. Then again, would you expect any differently from a movie made from a book. Look at Steven Kings movies. I say, if you can't produce your own movies, then don't try taking storylines from a book and twisting them around to make them look like your ideas."
1,Where's the twins?,"The movie was ok if you didn't read the book. If they are taking a book and making it a movie shouldn't they try to keep it as a close as possible. I was expecting it to be closely like the book but i was deeply disappointed. What happen to the story of the twins? That was one of the most importing things. They didn't even show how the Queen was made. That was the best part of the book. They cut so much out. I was expecting to get to meet the other vampires, they never mentioned them just showed them briefly at the end. And the end wasn't even close as it was in the book. The only things that were good were the acting and the music. Why didn't they let Anne Rice have a say.She should have let the people who made ""Interview with a vampire"" make this one, at least it would be have close."
4,great flick,"I love the Vampire Chronicles and I really enjoyed the movie. No, it was not just like the books, but if you read the director's notes on the website, he cites various reasons for that. But, I thought, overall, it worked well. I even liked Marius as the ""maker"" of Lestat better. Aaliyah (remember folks, she was only 22) did a great job and Stuart Townsend just blew Tom Cruise out of the water. He really made me believe he was Lestat. The goth music was perfect and the concert scene was great. I was also pleasantly surprised how Akasha was destroyed. (There just wasn't enough time in the movie to present all the vampires, i.e. Louis, Gabrielle - maybe next time). Most importantly - it's fantasy! Enjoy it for what it is!"
2,Where is the nearest exit?,I am glad I didn't see this at the movies. This was a poor book based movie. Where was the twin sister? The one with no tounge. Why didn't the other one not eat the heart of the queen? Where was Louis? The music was awful. I put the movie on mute and had subtitles so I could know what was being said without hearing satanic music by Marilyn Manson. I know this is based on the book but not by much. This movie could have done more with the book if it did less with the musical career of Lestat. The acting was good. If you want to see a vampire movie this isn't much of one either. I like Anne Rice but this movie could have been done better like Interview with a Vampire. Now that was a good movie.
2,OUCH !,"This movie does for 'Vampire Chronicles' what Ed Wood did forKlaatu.Redeeming facets? Paul McGann (Doctor Who # 8) in a nicehomage to (Doctor Who # 3) Jon Pertwee in the vamp-pic ""HouseThat Dripped Blood""."
1,"A commendable effort, but not quite the WORST film ever","The Vampire Lestat (Townsend reprising Cruise from INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE), now a famous rock star, resurrects evil vampire queen Akasha (Aaliyah in her last performance) who plans to dominate the world. This goes nowhere for more than one hundred unbearable minutes and bears virtually no resemblance to Anne Rice's novels (despite the title). Originally slated for video release, but went theatrical due to Aaliyah's death shortly after completion. What a waste."
1,The only good thing about this movie:,"""How did you make through the 50s in red velvet?""The reasons why this movie is an abomination to any fan of the book have been said and re-said, so I'll leave it at that :)"
3,"good effects, less tension",I saw this movie mainly because it is Aaliyah's last movie. She will surely be always missed. Unfortunately this movie is not as great as e.g. Romeo must die. The storyline doesn't really catch you and I think that the male actor was a weak choice. The effects are quite good. It's an ok movie but not that great
2,"....Yeah, If You Read The Books...DON'T WATCH THIS!","This movie sucked. They took two amazing books (The Vampire Lestat & Queen of the Damned) and slammed them together; hoping in some way to make a good movie...well, they failed! I know everyone was so hyped about this movie being Alyiah (sp) last film whem she died but the movie didn't do whatever start of a acting career justice. Hell, it was even like the Aksaha in the book! They storyline is all mashed together and ... MARIUS is NOT Lestat's sire and that is NOT how Lestat learned to play the violin. They should have taken the time and made two movies and cultivated the story. I do think Stuart Townsend made a wonderful Lestat and it's too bad he wasn't in Interview with a Vampire because it was Lestat's true age... but... trust me, rent this before you buy it. The only thing cool I found while watching a friend's DVD is that it has the music video's for a few of the songs....PS - The soundtrack is AMAZING"
1,AN AMAZING DISSAPOINTMENT,"Not worth the buy. If you are really curious rent this movie. I agree with most other messages posted but want to further stress my disappointment with this film. I am a large fan of Anne Rice's Vampire chronicles and thought that this movie was a disgrace to her character development and beautiful looks into a dark and beautiful melancholy world of seclusion and misunderstanding.IF however you are merely looking for yet another modern vampire action flick, which in no way tries to provide any new artistic inspiration to film, this might be worth the buy.Enjoy your surround sound, cgi, and digital resolution I will continue my search for something better than this."
2,very disappointing.,"This is a good movie for poeple that haven't read the book. The movie in itself isn't bad, with god actors and beautiful special effects. For these that have read the book, it's very disappointing. I 've a memory of a great book, long but never boring. Of course, to be remain loyal to the book, the movie would take a too long time, but here, the hystory has been changed, some charachters don't appear, ect. In my opinion, they could do better."
2,why bother?,"Why bother? I was a huge fan of the series of books written by Anne Rice. I was a big fan of this book's predecessor, Interview with the vampire. This film I could not enjoy. Maybe that's because I could not see it as a separate thing...I could not view this film without comparing it to the book, which, to be honest, is an impossibility anyway...it is too remote from it.Stuart Townsend's acting is horrible, the music doesn't quite fit the story and the special effects weren't up to par. And I'm not even going into the story, which was raped so heavily that it's unrecognisable. Apart from that, I didn't even find it enjoyable as a standalone movie.The verdict? Leave this one well alone, especially if you're an Anne Rice fan"
2,A visually stunning disappointment,"The movie adaptation makes a complete hash of the books and their timelines. This would be mostly fine if it had bothered to explain any of the characters' motivations, but it fails completely to do that. The end result is that you must read the books to understand the movie, but once you have read the books you see how much of a botch the movie really is.The visual effects and costuming were fantastic however, and if you can forgive the fact that everyone was acting around a mouthful of prosthetics, all of the actors did a wonderful job.Overall the movie seems to be a half hearted attempt to draw in the goth dollar without delivering too much."
4,The return fo the Queen,it is more driven by the mucisal landscape it sets up then the liniage it steals from the Anne Rice novels. I mean I thought it was great when Armond was at least a kid but can't we have the Red hair now please and Lestats is a blond sorry. Get a wig if you have to.Overall the DVD was great I liked the new fetures and added material we never got to see on the movie.The fact that it was more of a based on then a screen adaption doesn't take away the actualy quality of the DVD it's self I would recomend this product to any fan of the Vampire genera or Anne Rice fan just forget it's based on a book and think of it as an original piece.
4,good music.,"A very touching vampire tale,as expected from Anne rice.and although the charecter of Lestat in Queen of the damned contradicts in some ways his character in Interview with the vampire..it's a nice story.The cast is rateher good...great performance by steward townsend and Aaliya.And the music is good aswell."
3,Not Nearly That Bad,"Yes, I've read the book. Yes, I liked it better than the movie. But (gasp!) I liked the movie as well. It's not one of the all-time greats, but it was a fun way to pass a couple of hours, with great moody scenery, decent special effects for the vampires-in-motion, and yes, even good acting. Let me blaspheme here again by saying that Stuart Townsend makes a better Lestat than did Tom Cruise (but would it have been that much trouble to dye his hair blonde?), I loved Marius, and Aaliyah was respectable as Akasha. I'd like to have seen more screen time for the Ancients, but I understand why so many characters and scenes and backstory were cut out - because there's no way the complexity of the book could have been brought to the screen in its entirety, in only one brief film. It was necessary to condense. And it worked well enough."
1,Cheesy movie,If you loved Interview with a Vampire you will Hate this movie. The whole movie just seemed like a really long metal video. I haven't read any of Ms. Rice's novels but this movie seemed to leave too many question marks. The whole slow motion scene of Alliyah walking into the bar should've been edited so more of the story could've been explained. Not a good movie and painful to watch.
2,Should have known...,"Rather than re-hashing in detail what has already been said, let me just confirm the following:1) Below-Average acting in general. Stuart Townshend had some OK moments, and Vincent Perez was fairly good as Marius.2) Poor storyline. Hey, it's not a rule that you always have to stay faithful to the book....but if you're going to stray, at least make sure that the result is good.One other thing...I realize that a large percentage of people that went to see QOTD were Aaliyah fans, and I agree that she had talent...but don't make more out of her role than there really was. Anyone that thinks they can make a real assessment of her acting ability from the role she had in this movie is kidding themselves."
3,Not a great plot but worth the hour and a half,"The plot is predictable but the costuming, locations, and visual effects are worth a watch. The music is dark and hard and perfectly appropriate for the subject matter. But the driving force behind this movie is Stuart Townsend. He makes the movie. I've never seen an actor with such pentrating, hypnotic eyes. I've watched the movie a few times just to try to catch him blink. He's amazing. (Trust me girls, he's mezmerizing!)"
1,Egyptians Were Not Black,"Even African American authors have refuted the limp claim that ancient Egyptians were black. One African American writer refered to the theory as 'bad mythology'. Hence said, casting Aalliyah as QUEEN OF THE DAMNED (although she was great in the role) was just a politcally correct marketing scheme.I mean, have some common sense for goodness sake. Who lives in Egypt? Egyptians. And they are not African. This theory is just like the Black Israelites who say they are the real Jews,and that the race that calls themselves Jews are impostors. Baloney. It is a unfounded theory that has no basis in fact.It is just an attempt by some who don't like their history to create a more pleasing one. Nice thinking but it can't change the facts of history."
5,Excellent sourcebook,"This is a sourcebook, set out in chronological order, with a focus on art and architecture, that conveys a huge amount of information in a readable and even enjoyable fashion. For one writing on the period, the information here is invaluable, and mine is a keeper.There is a brief discussion of a drawing (found, I think, in a tomb) that seems to show a winged being descending. The image is fragmentary, but the reconstruction is well done and the discussion of what the image seems to show is excellently handled.As I've said (rather ironically) with the other sourcebooks in my research shelves, this is not a page-turner. Not all books should be. This is a book where the reader sits with a pencil and paper (or, perhaps, a laptop), frowns at a page, says 'Hmmmmm...' and takes notes.I recommend it very highly for research purposes."
5,Really Improved my Skin,"I have been taking Synovoderma for about four months now and I am a believer. I am ""over 50"" and noticed the standard wrinkles, dry skin and loss of firmness that comes with age. I have tried a lot of face and body creams to minimize the effects, but nothing seemed to help much until I started taking this supplement. Now I am convinced that beauty comes from within based on what you give your body to work with. What you put in your body does more to keep your skin young then what you rub into it. My skin looks better now then it did ten years ago. The elasticity has improved considerably - it seems more firm, softer and more hydrated with fewer fine lines. Don't waste money on expensive skin cream, this is so much more effective. I will keep taking this supplement forever!"
4,Nice software,"It works really well, but it would be much better if there was a way of jumping from Dictionary Entry to Thesaurus entry directly ... . This should be easy to fix in the next release. The other drawback is that the Dictionary loads slow. Once it is loaded the speed is acceptable ,but loading it into the memory takes a few sec."
5,Vintage Class!,"I had seen this poster on-line many times; but was hesitant to order because the colors were a bit off on each site. I finally chose Amazon; and Poster Discount, as I trusted these particular sellers. The poster arrived in perfect condition; but the colors were different from what appeared on the site. I was pleased that the background was more tan/yellow in color than what is shown. The colors are very distinct; and the artwork is supreme. I have several of Leonetto Cappiello's posters; and was not disappointed with this latest addition. This is by far one of the most famous of all the Mossant Hat Co. advertising posters; and it looks fantastic framed. If you're thinking of purchasing don't wait; you will not be disappointed."
2,the two stars are a stretch...,"My love of romance novels began with bodice rippers so although popular tastes have changed I always allow for ""that certain style of writing"" particular to romances written in the late 70s, early 80s. What bothered me most about this book was that the hero was a boor in the beginning and remained so until the end (478 pages!). Also, I found as the book progressed from the high seas to Jamaica to Virginia, it was a steady decline. Parts of it were a little too realistic and without much romance to temper the story's harsher elements, well, it left me with nothing to recommend it overall."
2,Dated Material,"A good source of basic information, but somewhat dated. However, considering the lack of available books on camera values it is somewhat adeqate. I would use it in conjunction with the internet to determine todays pricing."
4,Removable Dog Bowls,Easy to clean and works good for food. Not so good with water. The dish is too shallow for my large pooch so he just makes a big wet mess. I use a big stainless steel bowl for his water now. I like the fact that the bowls are removable so I can take one over to the sink when I'm mixing his food.
5,"First Class ""DaVinci"" ""DeBunking"" (sic)","I saw this programme when it was aired on Channel 4 in the UK in 2005.It is a first class production which mercilesly debunks the novel in a scholarly way.The problem faced by some is that this is a secular debunking,so charges of religious bias are groundless and crtics of this programme must rely on challenges to Christian teaching regarding Gnostic beliefs.A critical review of this programme is difficult to mount hence the reviewer who gave it 2 stars only justified this low figure, not because of the calibre of the programme, but because she disagreed with Christian teaching.It is 5 stars all the way and is deservedly considered to be the finest expose of the ""Da Vinci"" nonsense."
2,California Tan Sunsets Tanning Eyewear 1-PR Random Picked Colors,"Not going to lie, these things are cheaply made. Very thin plastic, when you wear these it is similar to looking through an empty bottle of Mountain Dew."
5,Tanning Sensets,Love these little tanning glasses....they are separate so they don't leave any line...they just cover the eyelids....Have used them for years...finally had to buy a new pair.....
2,does not block out light,"If you are looking out to block out the light %100 do not buy these. They are sheer, I don't see the point."
3,Bulb stopped working after 2 weeks,"I bought several of these ott lights from JoAnn's. One of them stopped working after 2 weeks and I returned it to JoAnn's. I still haven't gotten a replacement or a refund. That is a lot of money to spend, and I expected more from JoAnn's."
4,Soul Food,This album is a great example of why the 80's were so good for music. You didn't need drugs to expand the mind when you had albums like this one doing just that. Matt Johnson was one of the great fighters for social & moral justice of the 80's. It was the first album I played of the new millenium.
5,A sublime achievement.,"Since the day it came out, I've never stopped listening to this record. The incredible songwriting, the depth of feeling, the sheer exuberance and imagination, are incomparable. In my twenties, I related to the frustration and despair Matt Johnson sings about -- in my thirties, I appreciate the dry wit, and the ultimate hopefulness and acceptance which the album embraces in the end. Musically, it's a wild ride, from Jools Holland's uncredited piano flameout on ""Uncertain Smile"" to the quiet reflection of ""Soul Mining"" and the killer percussive attack of ""Giant."" This album is close to my heart indeed. If I could have only one record to listen to for the rest of my life, this would be it."
2,Save your money,"I got this card because it was the only thing the bookstore on my campus sold at the time that my linksys was stepped on and broken. This is a piece of garbage. I am on WinXP and the connection drops in and out. Constantly. My Linksys card worked flawlessly for over a year and a half. Also, if you have 2.4 Ghz phones in your house, this card is very susceptable to the interferance from it, so try not to keep the phone near the card if possible, but even this will not help much. This card is still not XP certified after being out for months, meaning either the company is to lazy/cheap to get it certified or it failed certification testing due to drives issues and overall poor quality. Tech support is also laughable. If you look at other online reviews, you will see that the card works great on some computers but will crash others, so its a toss up. All of of this amounts to one thing; SAVE YOUR MONEY! Im gonna go get another linksys tommorow."
1,didn't finish watching all cd s only watched one,It wasn't what I wanted :(. i'm interested in the little rascals with sound....not the slent series.Can I return these unused cd s
5,Amazing!,I love this product so much. I enjoyed watching these films with my family when I was younger and now they are all on Dvd. Well worth the money!
2,Not the best of them,I bought these for my husband who loves watching the Little Rascals. He was disappointed with this set as there were not many episodes and many were very old and not the more familiar ones seen on t.v. I don't feel it was worth the cost.
4,good Rascals set,"Great for the Little Rascals Fan, Especially since it is almost impossible to get episodes on DVD. but by no means complete.I would recommend buying it before it disappears again."
1,What was I thinking?,I loved these guys as a kid. This collection sucks!!! Don't BUY It! The first 3 DVD's are silent and the 5th DVD is a reunion show. The grand total for shows you can actually watch is 4. Take your time and search out the specific shows and characters you love and get them individually. If I could get my money back I would RUN to the nearest post office and return this item ASAP!!!
3,THE LITTLE RASCALS,They were always a favourite of mine when I was a kid. I did not find them as entertaining as I expected.
3,settle down,"Just to correct a criticism that others have had...This IS the complete collection of ""Little Rascals"" films. While the ""Our Gang"" series did run before and after these, it was only the Hal Roach talkies that were later retitled ""Little Rascals"" (when the series was sold to MGM)....and while most of the knocks this set has taken are valid, the ""faults"" won't bother 99% of the audience. If you're waiting for a better collection to come around, you may be waiting years or decades...and if this goes out of print the price will skyrocket, so pick it up now before you regret it."
4,Little Rascals 4+ stars,"This compilation of shorts will bring back great memories of the simple and tough times of the thirties and forties. The ""Our Gang"" crew are all here in a very well put together package that is worth the price of the admission. I used to watch these classic shorts as a child and they certainly bring me back to when acting was not so much an art but ""entertainment"" and that's what you get with this set of great DVD's. This set really gets rolling when ""Spanky"" gets into act. I definitely recommend this set.The Little Rascals: The Complete Collection"
4,Popular series for the ages !,These are child classics from a bygone era of innocense in children . Their world was in backyards and neighborhoods . They has little knowledge of the outside world and they used their imaginations and collaborations with each other to keep themselves entertained . The simplicity and humility are so appealing !
2,Great resource. Crappy binder,"The content is truly helpful when writing careplans. However, I'm writing this review because the paperback 5th edition is FALLING APART before I even finish my first assignment. Pages are literally falling out and I've barely begun to use this book! This is a quality problem that Springhouse should address. Students pay premium $$ for these books -- they ought to have a durable binding!"
5,Blues at it's best!,"Blues at it's best, Ronnie does his thing on this album and if you like blues I highly recommend this album. The man can jam!"
4,Our kids enjoy it...,"We purchased this movie and watched it with our 4yr old son and 2.5yr old daughter. We were concerned because there is a pretty long stretch of dark or scary stuff. The kids watched, looked a little concerned a couple of times, but they never got scared. My husband decided it was definitely not one of his favorites. It turns out that it IS one of our kids' favorites. They love it and ask for it every day. They play out the movie with each other when we won't let them watch it. They love pretending to be Gloomius and Pappy."
4,Rollie Pollie Ollie Great Fun,My two daughters ( age 5 and 1) loved this movie. But for adults it does kind of seem to drag on forever. Thus the 4 instead of 5 star rating.
3,Olie Olie Olie,"My soon to be 3 year old loves Rolie Polie Olie since the first time he the show on Playhouse Disney. The picture quality of the movie was great but the frames were too choppy and it gives your eyes a workout just to watch. The evil gloomius didn't scare my son too much but he was wondering who he was because this character was not introduced before. When he mentions him it is always who is the green scary guy? Overall, I think this movie was ok."
4,My 4 year old loves this - especially Gloomius,"My four year old loves this movie. He thinks Gloomius Maximus is great. He watched it for the first time about six months ago and has been building ray guns to ""gloom"" and ""ungloom"" us ever since. It has really engaged his imagination. He pretends about rockets, pirates and robots. It started him asking questions about space and real rockets. One day he even organized his whole pre-school class to play ""galaxy"" - a game he made up about rockets and planets - while on the playground. He can take or leave the TV show, but this is his favorite thing to watch on TV."
2,Too edgy for my taste as a Mom,"My 27 month old loves Rolie Polie Olie, but this feature is a departure from the sweet robots on tv. The villain looks like something Tim Burton (Nightmare Before Christmas) cooked up. There are also frowning characters with baseball bats in their hands floating in space. Plus the action and sound is, just like another reviewer said, frenetic. I wanted to run to the tv and turn it off.If I had screened this video, I would not have purchased it. It's just not what I like for my child. Of course, if you don't mind that sponge on Nickelodeon, this probably won't bother you either."
1,paddle,The paddle came as described. I prefer a larger diameter shaft to hold and one without the plastic coating part way up the shaft.
5,Great Book,"Very entertaining book that I couldn't put down once I started reading. A must read for anyone who likes hunting, the outdoors, and or adventure."
2,Uhhh... what happened!?,I'm sorry But I just had a hard time enjoying this season. After a few episodes I just stopped watching digimon for a long time. This was a complete dissapointment for me. I liked the original digi mon better. Now it's just some card game come to life! It's just all wrong. I put in a second star for animation It's excelent. But the storyline it just ugh... You may enjoy it if your a hard core digimon fan. like I said I just had a tough time enjoying it.
5,Great Product,"Palm One Stylus 3 Pack (m500 series)Much better than the stylus that came with the original Palm Pilot. Heavier and more sure to the touch.If I ever lose all three, I would not hesitate to re-buy."
4,Very Good but late arrival,THe book was in excellent condition but the only flaw was that it arrived after 20 days...very slow service...go to some other sellers...avoid these people...!!!
5,99 Luft Balloons,"This cut...99 Luftballoons came out in 83', when I lived in Florida...twenty six years ago! I have always had that recording on my mind...as it brought back many memories as did Duran Duran, Prince, Michael Jackson, Boy George and others, with their respective hits! I know I can always find what I am looking for...on ""Amazon.com"", and thank you. W."
5,WILD AS CAN BE !!,Power Rangers Wild Force Lion Heart will have you jumping out of your seats Cole a boy from the Amazon Rain Forest finds the Red Lion Animal Crystal and joins the team of the Power Rangers Wild Force (max taylor alyssa danny merrick). The rangers hunt and seek evil orgs created from Master Org this tape is worth IT!!
2,Nice when it worked.,"After I first installed the device, it worked okay until I rebooted the PC. Then, the TV app stopped loading. It showed the splash screen but the TV app itself never showed up after the splash screen went away. If I uninstalled and reinstalled the app and drivers, it would work again until I closed the TV app or rebooted the PC.I couldn't work out whether this was a problem with the card's application or drivers, or a conflict with other drivers on the system. Avermedia support was less than helpful, to put it mildly, and their web site is almost useless.The few times it worked, it seemed like a nice card - decent picture quality, etc.I have since purchased a Hauppauge, and it works great. And their website seems to have a lot more troubleshooting info on it, even though I have yet to need it. I guess you get what you pay for."
2,BUY IT AT THE GROCERY STORE PUBLIX!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Who would pay these prices, this stufff is fantastic, but I want any of you who have a Publix near by to go there for it...... I just purchased, they come packaged 2- 5oz servings for 3.50...... I just spent ten bucks on 30oz, and this site is trying to sell me 25oz for 35.00???? What a rip off. That said this stuff is fantastic and addicitve..... well behaved princes and princesses will even eat it. Flaky, not dry.... just yummy."
1,Don't waste your money,"I ordered this book after my husband was hospitilized with diverticulitis. I was hoping for some real life diet and lifestyle information. Instead, fasting, a basically vegetarian diet without spices, ""cold sponge down and friction rubs"", daily enemas, herbal laxatives, and ""toilet drills"" were advised by the author. I laughed through this book, because many of the suggestions were ridiculous."
5,Strawberry DS is fun,My 9 year old likes this game and can play for hours with it.I would like to see more Strawberry DS games.
3,Lusty entertainment but no historical document,"This film purporting to be an historical drama of Villa's exploits is often more like a comic operetta. The script by Ben Hecht is often nose-thumbing and satirical and the film often debunks Villa as a child-like, egotistical and lecherous bandit (a bravura and quite amusing performance by Beery). His blood-thirsty side-kick (Leo Carillo) is straight caricature. As a rip-roaring entertainment Viva Villa fits the bill quite nicely, for historical accuracy and fairness--look elsewhere. Interesting foot-note: The American journalist was supposed to have been played by Lee Tracy. Mr Tracy while in Mexico and soused to the gills answered Mother Nature's call from his balcony and provided a parade that was marching underneath with quite a shower. MGM, understandably replaced him with Stuart Erwin. 3 1/2 stars."
3,Diet-Free Forever,"I did not care for this item at all. I felt that it was not very informative. I often saw reptative ""Daily Guidance Messages and have removed it from my system."
3,disappointed,"I am a big fan of Michael Shenker and bought this live album having heard it used the lead singer from the 'Written in the Sand' Album (where is Mike's mechanic?) Turns out he sings very few and most of the reproductions of the songs are a far cry from the originals, or even previous Live versions. Not recommended."
1,Boring,"Bought this movie because of Danny Devito and Jonah Hill. Devito is barely in it. Jonah Hill is not in it enough. It had a few funny moments, but I would not watch it again!!"
3,Cliffhanger Video,"Power Rangers Wild Force was simply not good enough as a series, especially as the next series to follow Power Rangers Time Force.The episodes on this video are barely average and the ending isn't particularly conclusive. Unlike previous Power Rangers videos, this one ends on a cliffhanger, and it isn't very welcome because the resolution isn't even available on video."
1,Not a helpful resource,"This thin volume is poorly written, and is designed as a vehicle for the author's one study recommending that children diagnosed with Pervasive Developmental Disorder be treated with chiropractic care. Dr. Fallon's chapters on executive function and the sensory experiences of children with Sensory Integration Disorder do not clearly explain either the theoretical understanding nor subjective experience of the disorder. Parents looking for practical help or suggestions for treatment of their children will find little of use here."
1,Worthless,"I was hoping to learn more about my daughter's PDD but only learned that the author, a chiropractor, believes chiropractic care is THE way to treat ""it"". The book is very poorly written and seems to give facts about PDD, sensory integration and ADD that could have easily been taken from any text on those subjects. I felt let down and cheated when the chiropractic angle was introduced near the end of the book. I wanted to learn more about PDD but it was not to be with this book. Don't waste your money. If you want a truly informative book with great lists (broken down into age groups), read ""The Out of Sync Child"" by Carol Stock Kranowitz. THIS is the book that gave me great insight to my child's PDD and sensory integration issues. I felt as though the author could see into my house and was talking about my child."
2,Not worth it,"The book had very little to do with organization. It dealt with how to declutter your home, but it did not explain how to reassemble it when all of the junk was removed. Also, only half of the book was dedicated to organization. The other half contained pictures of rooms that Mr. Lowell and company designed. It is more like a picture book than anything else."
1,WHO CARES!?!?!,"You won't care if anyone is ""Wild Enough for Willa."" What I want to know is how much the publisher paid Nora Roberts to use her quote, ""Want it all? Read Ann Majors."" on the front cover. I know Ms. Roberts didn't read the book. Had she read it, she would not have allowed her name to be used anywhere near it. This is the most convoluted and inane piece of ""literature"" I've ever had the misfortune to pick up. Pass, pass, pass on this one!"
1,If only there were a 0 star option...,"This is the most disgustingly melodramatic piece of tripe that I have ever read. The heroine is annoying, and the hero is an offensive lout who comes very close to raping her at least once, attempting to force her to give him oral pleasure. This is not my idea of romance, and I wouldn't check it out in the library if I were you, let alone buy it!"
5,Seasons Under Heaven,"I don't ""do fiction"", but this one had me in tears. Great on relationship/character development. I loved it!"
1,Sounds like Andrew Lloyd Webber on narcotics,"This has got to be one of the worst albums i've ever heard in my life. It's about as pleasing to the ear as listening to a cat in a blender. The melodies were explosively boring and repeated so often that i was convinced i was stuck in some kind of time rift; you know, like in that movie Groundhog's Day.I feel I have made an unfair comparison in my title. At least ALW uses decent singers on his outtakes. Waters sounded like he had been suffering from severe constipation before recording this album. As for Clapton's Guitar playing; it was incredible, as always, but didn't come close to saving this lost cause.In closing I would recommend anyone who is not completely tone-deaf and has even the smallest inclination of taste to stay as far away from this road-accident of an album as possible.Man, it was really that bad."
2,Disappointing,"I found the sexual content to be sleazy and totally unnecessary. Would the author give this proudly to his daughter or granddaughter to read? The plot was acceptable, but predictable for the most part. All in all, I was disappointed."
5,Miyamoto Musashi,"Extremely detailed investigation into Miyamoto Musashi and his life and writings. Very long book, a lot of info that is hard to find about Musashi can be found in this book."
5,good things come in small packages,this products rocks. i usually don't write reviews for anything but i felt that in this case that i must because looks and the price can be deceiving. it's cheap and small but that only adds to it's greatness. i REALLY recommend it.
4,Worked OK I think,"I just finished useing this product and I think it worked OK. I can't look at my inside to see for sure but I have been more regular. There is some cramps involved with this product, but not too bad. Drink plenty of water. Overall I would use it again."
4,Has its good points,"I like all kinds of Messiahs, from the big and bombastic performances which were popular for over 150 years to the fine and nuanced ""authentic"" approaches that regained popularity in the last 50 years. Christie's orchestra is very fine and precise. The soloists are excellent but there's one problem. Countertenors did not exist in the 18th century. It is a poor imitation of the castrato voice. So why use the limited dynamic range of the falsetto voice? Since Castrati are no longer an option why not just do what conductors have been doing for 200 years and use a female alto. It may not be ""authentic"" but then neither are countertenors. The great Norma Proctor may be gone but I'll take any good contralto or mezzo over a guy singing falsetto."
5,Outstanding Period Performance at Budget Price,"I've been hunting for a Messiah for years, but never found one I was happy with. My brother pointed this one out, saying it was a Gramophone first choice.Particular highlight is Nathan Berg (bass). Many recordings have a bass who sounds like a tenor, but Nathan Berg sings the arias with a rich, deep and flexible bass voice. Pity they gave ""But Who May Abide"" to the alto, but sadly that seems par for the course these days.The direction and orchestral sound are excellent, as you'd expect with Christie and LAF, and the choral singing bright. This together with outstanding soloists and a budget price tag - what more do you want?Oh, and a note to the previous reviewer who criticized the ""flights of fancy"" and ""improvisation"": That's what a 'da capo' aria is all about! After you sing the second section you repeat the first section with your own embellishment. I assure you, Handel expected it!"
3,What i found about this card,"First i have to say that i don't have this card, but i was thinking on buy one, what did stop me?, well first it says that have the game ""zap 2016"", that version of the game is only for 16 bits colored handhelds (i have a m500 handheld, as you know it is a grey, non colored handheld), after that i went to palm.com and try to find out a little more, and back there i saw all the games included on this card, i was dissapointed, it have really great games, like zap and simcity, but the others ones are not the kind of game i like the most, well, i also have to say that if you buy this card you will save money and you wont sacrifice any memory on your palm. Underneath it all it is a good product if you like casino's games, but be carefull, i didn't continue investigating about this card so i dont know if all the games will work on a non colored palm, maybe they will... or maybe not."
2,Disappointed,I am working on unlocking the solitaire and chess/checkers/backgammon. I have already tried resetting and exchanging the card. I hope to fix the problems but it has wasted a hell of a lot of my time. I would NOT recommend this to anyone.
2,Very small book. Very big price.,"This book is very small, almost paper-backed size. I have paperbacks that are substantially larger. As a result, the print is very small and hard to read. I didn't see a physical size listed, but the description made it sound like a standard size volume. The paper is also very fine and delicate. I have to be careful not to tear it when I am reading it. The story within the book is outstanding and I purchased it because a hotel I stayed in had a copy on a ""loaner"". I was snowed in for two days but didn't have time to finish it. A great read, and one I have had on my personal ""must read"" list for years. Buy a full-size book and you'll love it."
1,Not a good game.,"I bought this game at a convention quite a while ago. The way that the people where talking about it seemed like it was such a good game and was one of the best at the time. They where wrong.The controls are horrible (Especially if you have tourrets), and it was NOTHING from what it seemed it would be. I played it for nearly an hour as well, and got close to beating it but I just put the controller down after a bit as it was just too bad for the controls."
2,I bought is and played it for 2 hours and haven't touched it.,I thought flying dragons around would be fun and it was for about 2 hours and then I was bored and haven't played it for over 2 years. The game looks good but the flying controls didn't feel natural and the fighting was difficult to master. I play a ton of dungeon stomp RPG's and this just didn't pan out.
3,It has its moments,"The game has its moments but it can also be pretty frustrating on a couple of missions. The game shines when there are huge battles going on below you and it lets you just fly over the battlefield and wreak havok. However, other parts of the game are marred by unclear or frustrating time limited objectives. If you're interested in this type of game and know what you're getting yourself into, try to find a used copy somewhere. The controls are alright with the patch but the camera sometimes just goes crazy and is all over the place. Overall it was worth the $6 I spent on it but I feel sorry for everyone who bought it at full price upon release."
2,broke in one month,"the treadmill seemed nice, but experienced a mystical electrical failure within a month. nautilus came out twice over a three week period to fix it but couldnt. they stand behind their products though and are getting me a new one. unfortunately i havent had a treadmill for a month and really need the workout."
3,So So,I am building a camping set/emergency set. THe finish is decent. I did notice there were a few dots where you can tell the metal was used to coat these plates. It still beats having paper plates in an emergency.
5,Guinness bottle opener,"I bought this because we are always misplacing our bottle opener and it is great. Nice & heavy construction. Easy to mount -- came with two screws that I just drilled into the wall -- and it was ready to go. The boyfriend loved it so much he said that it was a great Christmas present. Meanwhile, his very expensive camera equipment kit is sitting unused and collecting dust. We use this bottle opener all the time and we are very happy with it. Mounted it right over the trash bin so there was no need to buy a coordinating cap catcher."
3,"Nice, but...","The photographs are wonderful, the book is classy. The text is kept short to not interfere with the pictures.A bit too compressed, in my opionion. I would have liked more than four lines of text telling me that something is often depicted.It's a wonderful book to have it displayed on a table, and to show off a little bit, but that's not the reason why I buy books..."
1,Yuck.,"I think Sandra wrote this one in a hurry just for something to do. I can't believe I even finished it, but as a Sandra Brown fan, I was hoping it would get better. I guess I just don't enjoy that instant from first sight sexual attraction. It was so unrealistic and sappy--a real disappointment."
1,Not the best!,I listened to the audio cassette recording and I just didn't care for the story or the characters and I only finished the tapes to see what would happen with the guy named Carter Madison and the lady named Sloan Fairchild and this is not something I would listen to again and was not a keeper!
1,TRIPE DISGUISED AS FICTION,I have read several of Sandra Brown's books but this one is nothing but pure garbage. I like a good romance book just like the next person but this went beyond that. I would have to rate it XXX in the sex department and FFF in the writing quality
2,Get The Paperback Book Instead of the Audio Recording!,"I listened to the audio cassette version and didn't like it, the story seems like it was good but I just wasn't impressed with the audio recording, it was too abridged and I just wasn't impressed and I felt it could have been done better. I'm thinking of going to a used book store and looking for the paperback version of Sandra Brown's Breakfast in Bed because the story itself seems that it is actually enjoyable and that it is just the audio recording that is lacking."
2,REPEAT OF ALL HER OTHER BOOKS-TOO PREDITABLE.,I HAVE READ QUITE A FEW OF SANDRA BROWN'S BOOKS HOPING THAT THERE WOULD BE A SIMPLE EVERYDAY MAN AND WOMAN FALLING IN LOVE. SANDRA BROWN ALWAYS WRITES SOME TOTALLY OUTRAGEOUS IMPOSSIBLE LOVE AFFAIR. PEOPLE CAN FALL IN LOVE IN THE SIMPLEST OF WAYS. MAYBE SOME PEOPLE LIKE THE FANTASY I PREFER NOT. GIVE ME REALITY PLEASE
4,Solid Shirt,I have worn Black Dickey T-shirts for 12 years. I buy 4 each year and wear a clean T every day. Strong stitching and great wear. Only problem is that they are made in Honduras instead of the USA as they were a few years ago.
2,Not what they used to be,"I don't know if they changed factories or what but these are not the same quality they used to be. No longer a seamless tube body(I hate the seams on side that tickle all day), the collars are stretchy, saggy, loose, and the material feels thinner as well. Looks like after 15+ years I'll have to find another brand. Too bad, I used to love these shirts."
5,Good reference Good reading,The Cookbook is a very useful reference. It's loaded with examples that can be applied immediatly to everyday situations.Not much abstraction here this book is about getting the job done. Most Cisco subjects are covered. Solutions to most problems are easy to find. This book was easy to read. The Cisco Cookbook provides more than the usual information most administrators have seen many many times. I endorse this book for intermediate & advanced users. I think the Cisco Cookbook will go thru many revisions.
1,A potentially good book rendered practically useless for Kindle,"I cannot speak to the quality of this book in paper form but for the Kindle the ""Solutions"" that they publish are all incorrect. the code has been stripped in some peculiar way.for instance from chapeter 5.4 Using Static Routing:""SolutionYou can configure a static route with the ip route command, as follows:Router# configure terminalEnter configuration commands, one per line. End with CNTL/ Z.Router( config)# 10.35.15.5 255.255.255.255Router( config)# endRouter#""This does absolutely nothing. it is not a valid command nor can I even figure out what the book was trying to tell me.This happens repeatedly throughout the book to the extend that I had to go out and buy a different book.Maybe the hardcopy book is better, the quality of the writing looks decent enough but with every example mangled, it makes it near impossible to learn anything useful from this book.At this point I wont be trying anything else from this company for kindle."
1,Product either scratched or broken. Buy at your own risk.,All magnets were either scratched or broken. Buy at your own risk. Was shipped in a plastic bag.I was appalled.
3,Over priced for how fragile they are,If they were better quality they might be worth the price. They shatter instantly if dropped even a short distance.
4,Good xD picture card with good capacity,I've been using this xD picture card for nearly a year now and it's semi-permanently installed in my Olympus D-425 digicam. It can hold over 500 1600x1200 pictures (my preferred resolution for website work) and I've used it extensively at several major events over the past year as well as several library research trips. No complaints!
5,Morse: Dead on Time,Inspector Morse: Dead on time is a collection of well written plots and interesting characterizations. We enjoyed every selection and would give the set as a gift to friends.
3,Could use some work...,"The book did not explain certain parts in detail. It had some examples but did not have an example for the first 6 chapters of the book showing the whole program and how it may look. The book is based on the advanced and did not go to those who are beginners or intermediate and do not really know a lot about databases. It assumes that you know about databases and their features. I think this book could use some work. It could be better with more examples and better explanations (such as on queries). But, it is a good book overall."
3,Not too bad..,"Salvadork looks about 10 doesn't he?Anyway,Elizabeth is dating Blue,and she feels uncomfortable around him.She really wants to date Salvadore.They're both boring so why she would date either...Also,The Wakefield twins recieve some news that could change their lives...in a bad way."
2,I don't know about this one!,"I do get the sense that the author rushed through writing this book so as to get to the end of the series. Since a lot of detail and thought were put into the previous books in the series, this is not right for an author to do. It seems as if Blue and Liz genuinely liked each other all throughout the series and then their romance was rushed so that the series could end with Sal and Liz together. That would have taken much more time to develop; she would not have realistically suddenly realized that Sal was too amazing to pass up. Blue was a great guy too. I'm a little surprised at the author for doing such a rushed, messy job at ending the series. The same thing happened with the Sweet Valley Twins series. The general quality of work went down at the end as she scrambled to make all ends meet in a mere couple of books. Shame on Francine Pascal. She disappointed me and probably lots of other fans."
1,Pretty Boring to Read About the characters,"The characters were like stick-men, no dimension at all. They all talked the same, acted the same, so basically WERE the same. One of the elements in a good book is characterization, this book does not deliever that."
3,Island beauty,"This book is written in a lovely way and is so refreshing. The photos of the people living on this Island are so beautiful and natural. Good recipes for hot days are included. Recommended for lovers of the simple, natural way."
1,Wouldn't install,"The title of my review says it all. Bought this & tried on a new Dell laptop. The installation of the driver failed with no real help in diagnosing the problem. Their tech support was pretty clueless (and no 800 number). The only thing they did was to suggest updating this, then retry the install, update that, then retry again. And again, and again. For all I know the box I received was defective but all they wanted me to do was to retry the install."
5,"Works for me, even better with a patch","When I first picked up this device, I had some problems with audio/video sync, especially when trying to capture 1 hour or longer videos. This wasn't a big deal to me personally since 90% of what I am doing is converting 1/2 hour TV shows to DVD. This problem didn't really affect me, and the quality of the video was solid enough that I decided to go ahead and keep it around.So, I was surfing around a few days ago and I was surprised to find Avermedia had posted some new drivers and patches to their web site and I went ahead and checked them out. Still no problems with the 1/2 hour shows, and I captured a couple of hour-long specials and didn't see any sync problems either. I didn't see anyone mention the patch files, so figured I'd post the info here for anyone who still has the sync problems."
4,Concise and Thorough,"This paperback volume is a bit pricey but worth it for the information contained. Line drawings accompany and compliment the text. This book is very much up-to-date. Two shortcomings kept it from a 5 star rating: the bees & wasps are not included, and the addition of some color plates would have been most helpful."
1,No Java support in the UML Diagrams .... WT%*#^!,"One would hope that a company with Microsoft's resources could produce a piece of working software and Visio does work. However, excluding Java from UML diagrams is such an outrageous affront to half the programming community that it's a 1 for me."
4,No Support For Java,"Java Is not supported becuase it is a Sun Microsystems format. Accordingly, Microsoft is trying to force customers to migrate to their formats."
3,ehh i've seen better,All i can say is this isn't the best movie i've seen. It had a few humerous scenes; i suppose younger ones (young teens) would enjoy this movie more.
5,Great Movie!,"I loved this movie, and no Im not some 12 yr old girl with a crush on jtt, I just think hes an awsome actor. Its about a colledge kid, Jake who needs to get home for Christmas if he wants his dad's porshe. But all of a sudden he wakes in a dedert wearing the santa uniform, then he starts the adventure home."
5,One of our Christmas favorites,"This movie has become one of our Christmas favorites. This movie showcases a young Jessica Biel, and amusing plot. First showed it to my son when he was 10 and it has become part of our Christmas tradition to watch every year."
3,"Good re-mix, Bad live!!","This cd was quite a surprise. Usually a very strong band that has a powerful live set falls short on this disc. Trying to capitalize on it ""down and intimate"" tour with the new album, the audio is a little rough. It sounds like bootlegs of the band. The cover of the Cash song,""Don't take your guns to town"" is a silly venture. The flip side of all this is that the re-mixes are very fun. I usually find U2 mixes a little over indulgent but here they are tight and add to the song. I would have to say that this is one for the collector only."
4,Elevation PT.1 (Limited Edition),I think the Don't Take Your Guns To Town was a great cover! Bono's voice is just perfect - a great tribute to Johnny Cash. BTW this remix by U2 was nominated in 99 for best Live Performance for a tribute/concert special. It is a great version if you like that style!
2,not for small objects,"I purchased this gripper because the length is exactly what we were looking for. My mom is elderly and she needs something to help her reach down and grab her pants on the floor. It would have provided her with some privacy instead of having me come in to pull her pants up. Unfortunately this item is more geared toward grasping larger items or round items. the ends don't close/align well enough to pick up papers and clothing just pulls right through the ends. I really like that you can change the orientation of the gripping mechanism, I just wish it had more strength. I am opting for another brand that has more of a 'toothy' grip as I think that will help better with clothing."
5,Short grabber stick,My wife is in a nursing home (coming home this week( and she said she wanted one of these things but shorter than the much longer ones she has at home. She was very pleased with this short model and it works fine and she can keep it right by her bedside. Worth the money for sure.
2,I've had better reachers,"This is a well-made item, but it has a couple of big drawbacks. First, the length. I thought it would be nice to use from my electric scooter and it would fit well in my scooter basket. It fits ok, but does not have much reach. I have to be quite close to an item in order to pick it up. My longer, folding reacher works better. Second, the tips do not hold anything as well as the rubber suction tips on other reachers. Many things slip out of the grip of the plastic tips and it frustrates me to no end. For now, I use this reacher to get things out of the back of the dryer in the laundryroom. Would not buy again."
3,So-so,"Not what I expected - sort of sloooow... lots of stretching. You might like it, but check the library first. I threw mine away."
5,Great help to learn about Clematis!,Enjoyed her writing style. The details will be helpful as I learn about this plant. Has everything you need to know about this marvelous plant.
4,"Good thoughts, no conclusion","This book was really a level above what I like to read casually - not a lot of potential for skimming or chapter highlighting. The author is a bit heavy on Nietzsche and Sartre - he seems to draw a parallel to one of them in almost every passage, but it was a nice twist to see the old guys from this particular angle. In the end, the book was more a review of concepts than any sort of declaration - it read a lot like a dissertation. He sort of bounced from topic to topic, redefining spirituality about a hundred times and never really resting on any particular conclusion.The gist of his thesis: Anyone is spiritual if they consider themselves spiritual, since you can define spirituality most any way you want to.I really prefer a book with more of an opinion, whether I agree with it or not. But it was a nice flexing of the cortex."
1,Tastes like nothing...,"And the only way I would even know this Darjeeling Tazo Tea should taste differently is because I've had a superb, loose leaf, organic Darjeeling out of the tea bins at my local health food store. This tea is bad, which was unexpected considering the brand. Off to the office tea basket it goes with all of the other generic teas where someone else who doesn't know what it's supposed to taste like ""might"" enjoy it - lol."
4,Still has value,"I purchased this book back in 1995. While a lot of the book is irrelevant to the digital and video age, that is still A LOT that can be taken from this book. There are plenty of tricks of the trade with regards to shooting, budgeting, etc. that are still in use today. One example that I can give is while shooting in Minnesota, they simply created a road sign welcoming the characters to a city that was nowhere near them and outside of their operating budget. So, if your setting is in New York and cannot afford to shoot there, build a road sign that says, ""Welcome to New York"" on a location near you.The writers have put out books on shooting in the digital age. They're well worth the purchase price. I also found them to be very approachable, answering letters (pre-email) and e-mails.Please do not dismiss this book."
3,Pros and cons of the book,"While a interesting, as far as the mages are concerned, and funny, in the case of some stories, the book's main problems is that it is not regular, meaning it has some good and bad stories, and none of them are really important, just interesting... Not really a important book to those who want to know FR's stories, for the collectors, give it a try!"
3,Too technical,The book is almost hard to read. It's written very technically and doesn't grab the reader. It's an interesting subject but not a story really more of a report on what happened. Not exactly what I was expecting.
5,a great read,"I read this for a class called ""The College Student"" - what a perfect choice. It's pretty insightful and helpful... it spells things out that make sense and that I've experienced as a college student myself. Well-written and enjoyable."
2,"Broad strokes about student life, not really about the freshman year","I expected this book to be about the freshman year experience, based on the title and the way that the book began. However, the book ended up being more about broad strokes describing student life. The author did not live in a freshman residence hall and I am unsure if she primarily enrolled in gateway classes or not. Memorable aspects include her depiction of the student community being comprised of independent networks and the way students learn to manage college (cut corners) as a stragegy to manage their time."
3,Leone's roots,"COLOSSUS OF RHODES provides a good look at Sergio Leone's roots--and the roots of the Italian Western--in the peplum (or ""sword and sandal"") genre that dominated popular Italian film in the late 50s and early 60s, just before the western boom. There is little in this film to suggest the master stylist that Leone would become just a few years later. But it's one of the better peplum films, with high production values that look especially good on this transfer. And there is one delightful shot that seems to prefigure, in a comic way, Leone's later attraction to extreme closeups of eyeballs."
3,Some Good Songs,"The previous reviewers seem to be unaware that there are TWO versions of this album: one called ""Listening CD"" (#701981459X) which has the lyrics and a second called ""Accompaniment CD"" (#3019814588) without. As performers, we own both versions - one to learn the lyrics and the second to use as accompaniment for performance.Some of the songs are less than spectacular, but for us ""To Me"" makes up for any shortcomings in other selections. We sang it at our best friends' wedding years ago, and our daughter asked that it be sung at her own wedding. There are several other winners here.Just be certain you specify which version you want when you order!"
1,Disappointing,"This product was disappointing, in that it sounded very mechanical, the sounds were only about 5 notes, and repetitive. Not the soothing comfort I was looking for."
1,White Noise Junk,First night with unit I set it for white noise. I purposely purchased this unit as it had a white noise setting. The white noise came on and everything was good...for about 3 or 4 hours then the white noise had some other background sounds that were quite audible. I purchased the unit for noise while I sleep.With the added background noise it makes it very difficult to sleep.If you're looking for a good white noise generator..DO NOT buy this unit..
4,Light weight alternative to a hard case,"The Orion Padded Case for ShortTube 80 is a great way to store your Orion Short Tube 80mm telescope. The one shortcoming of this case is that there are no pockets, internal or external, for accessories, like eyepieces or filters. It does allow you to store the telescope with the finder attached, so it is easier to set up the telescope when you take it out. Also, the long handles allow you to hang the case on ones shoulder. If you do not need a hard case, this is a good case to store and transport your Short Tube 80 telescope."
4,Funny in the beginning,"I really liked the MST3 crew candid talk in the beginning, as the movie moved on the candid talk seemed to have dissapear to me. Def. a rated B- film. Needs more plot!"
5,GREAT DEAL!,"I paid half price for this & I'm thrilled with it! I have only one problem, I don't think it has a shock absorb on the deck. If I'm wrong, it doesn't feel like it has one. The 30 year warrenty is on the motor & frame. Parts & labor is only for a year. It has many program settings. Wireless heart rate monitor. There are also hand grips for the heart rate. You can adjust the incline & speed on the handgrips as well as on the console. It asks you how long you want to work out for, your weight, calories you want to burn, & maximum speed. The console has a little easy to remove ""shelf"" for a book or magazine may it do ya fine. It is a space saver design & it is a breeze to fold up & put away! I am very happy that I made this purchase!"
4,Good basic treadmill,"I've had my treadmill for about 8 months. It is sturdy and has good features like incline up to 12%, speed and incline adjust button on the rails and quick keys for fast walk(3mph)jog(4.6mph) and run(6mph). The feature make interval training easy. The downsides: calibration is off, so my actual pace is a little faster that the machine reads. The HR monitor is inaccurate enough to be a joke. The machine functions fine. It has been instrumental in my recent 47lb weight loss."
4,A Jazz Time Capsule,"The songs done by the ""Name"" artists on this CD didn't impress me. But, there are 11 tracks by mostly ""No Names"" that I burned onto a seperate CD years ago that I still enjoy on a regular basis. These artists were jazz musicians from the '50's and '60's that clearly played just for the love of making music. While their talent isn't honed like the big names, it's real, lively and visceral jazz making that still comes across loud and clear decades later. Depending on your taste, you may like some of the harsh blues tunes of certain artists but they weren't for me. If you would like to have a window into the jazz of the small clubs of yesteryear you will find a good sampling here."
2,"Ultimate, the same old points","This is a well written book that makes a number of points via anecdotal evidence. Unfortunate, it is another in a growing collection of documents that makes no attempt to understand or explain why Hollywood acts the way it does. I wish the author had made at least a slight effort to explore why Hollywood reacted the way it did when he was denied permission to use movie clips for his personal use, or why it is more than problematic that a minister likes to download TV programs from a satellite feed instead of waiting for the broadcast. These responses should come from actual industry decision-makers, and not the projected opinions of their critics."
5,Great game!,"Triple Triumph is a great game - it's different from the other games we own. It requires both thinking and luck, and it plays out differently each time. I can play my hardest with my 6 year old, and there's no telling which one of us will win!"
1,Corrective,This review is meant to bring a little balance. It is clear that Mr. Hickey himself has written multiple reviews on his own book. He also has made a habit of writing one star reviews in which he bashes the philosophy department at Notre Dame and advertises his books. Until Amazon can rid us of Mr. Hickey this review will serve to partially offset his self reviews and inform those that are directed to this page by his shameless self promotion.
1,Didn't Work,"The custemer had to pack it, make a trip to the post office, pay, pay, pay to ship it back. Great inconvenience."
1,Bad Product,"I would not recommend purchasing this product.We purchased the first radio from Amazon and after following all directions in the manual, could not get any power response at all either with plug in power or by using batteries. We returned the product and Amazon replaced it with another. The volume control in the replacement radio would only respond to ""louder volume"" and we could not lower volume either manually or with the remote. We returned the product and requested a refund. We subsequently purchased another brand radio from another source and are quite happy with it.the only reason we give this even a ""one star"" is that Amazon was very responsive in both exchanges and refunds of costs."
2,Remarkably unintuitive,"I bought this for my kids to use, and they like it. They only play CDs; they know how to work it; they like that it's not heavy. However, it is remarkably unintuitive. The first time we used it, the songs were repeating, and I had to read the directions to figure out how to get it off this setting. The buttons that control the CD player are arranged around the CD area but also on the front of the player. The buttons that control the tape player are next to where the CDs are inserted. A very illogical arrangement and a disappointment. I shouldn't have to study the buttons before I can get my music going.Because this is for the kids, its appearance doesn't bother me, but I'd be disappointed if I bought it for myself. The colors are strong, like something Little Tikes would make, and the shape is pretty big and pretty round. I don't imagine that it would blend in with most adult surroundings."
1,Too similar and annoying,"Yes, it looks like I am in the minority of reviewers who did not think very highly of this album. The phrase, ""If you've heard one, you've heard them all"", comes to mind. Each track changes slightly...way too slightly for me. I also found the voice sounding a little too falsetto and thus very annoying. Maybe this is traditional Icelandic music. I am not an Icelandic music scholar. But I have studied some of Iceland and it's people. From what little I know this music does not seem fit to represent the granduer of the land or the Scandinavian and Irish people who settled there. Maybe if you have a skillful music ear, you can appreciate this CD. Mine's not even fit to use as a coaster."
5,Top Notch Glass,"After looking and researching several prime lenses for my Pentax K-5 I purchased the FA-77. It's been 2 months and I have yet to take if off my camera. If you are looking for a Portrait lens, for head and shoulder shots, this is it... Razor sharp images... Yes it's a bit noisy focusing but I got over that after I took the first few pics with it. I am not a professional, and this was a lot of money for me to spend. This lens has stepped my images up a couple of notches.Note: It is a short tele lens, to give you and idea of this....in order to get a full head to feet shot of a person, you will have to back off about 20 feet......So those wishing for full body shots may want to opt for a shorter focal length."
1,Don't waste your money on this book,"I can't belive people actuallt enjoyed reading this. this is terrible. I'm an EMT in one of the top rated systems in the world. This book, is not the best I've read. Although Pat and Ed are outstanding EMT's, they make the job sound like you just drive there, get on-scene and be a cowboy. I disagree with the reputation they give all public safety personnel."
2,Buy this only if you have no other choice,"This part will allow your 486 to run faster but it is based on the ancient AMD5x86 which is one of the worst CPU cores ever. It has dozens of bugs AMD has abandoned and will never fix. If you run mostly DOS programs you will probably be fine. If you run Windows 3.1 then you are just asking for trouble. Don't even think about puting Win95 (or above) on this thing. As a rule of thumb this CPU will run slower than a Pentium 60Mhz.For a better value search around for the cheapest Celeron or K6-2 based system you can find. I have seen complete systems with 15"" monitors for $400 new in stores. Try www.pricewatch.com and search around - you can find refurbished systems for even less (offer friends $100-$200 for an old Pentium or Pentium II and I bet you find a taker and a PC that actually can run newer software).You won't be sorry."
5,Loved the book!!!!,"This Regency didn't have the normal things a Regency does. Most Regencies that I have read have a mystery to be solved in them. This one did not. This Regency novel dealt more with feelings than anything else. Belinda Presleigh was definitely not a beauty. However, the Earl of Berrington was quite a catch. Poor Belinda gets ""tricked"" by her mother into ""trapping"" the Earl of Berrington into marriage. Upon their marriage, they go to the Earl's country estate. The Earl returns immediately to London leaving Poor Belinda with the ""wicked"" sister-in-law and sister. I did find this a very enjoyable read and would definitely recommend it."
5,"Seriously, WOW",It is amazing. Turns your plants GREEN and strong.Good for roots and spray feedings. Works great for me.
5,Very Cool,"This is a great album from the the New wave of British Heavy Metal era, alsting from '79-81. Though this band showed a lot of promise like many of their peers, they never got recognized like they should.But enough of that. This album is quite heavy and extremely fast, especially ""heaven lies aboe"" and ""at least they tried."" My favorite song on the album is ""Paradise"" and ""Vicious Bastards' but they're all pretty much good. If you are a fan of Black Sabbath, Motorhead, or any band from that time period, I strongly recommend you buy this album, it's worth it!"
4,Inspirational Comedy,"The Castle is NOT a cocodile dundee type comedy.It is typical of other ""serious"" Australian films being producined at that time, with idealist themes.The theme of The Castle is ""money can't buy happiness"", however, comedy is cleverly used to subdue this unrealistic theme until the end of the movie.It was hard to accept that the Kerrigan's could be happy, and I was cringing at the stupidity of the characters throughout the film... but I slowly began to urge them on, and by the end of the film I felt like I could be have been one of them.The only thing that I could not accept was that tow-truck drivers are not as friendly as Darryl Kerrigan, and this profession did not suit his character."
5,A great Australian classic,"leaves a nice fuzzy feeling after watching. One of those films that will continue to reminisce in your mind, long after it ends"
4,"Oh, that's a great -- what do you call it? -- a movie!","They're not the brightest bulbs on the string. But if you enjoy subtle humor and irony, this loving and lovable family will keep you laughing throughout the movie. Their enthusiasm for finding something special in the mundane is incessantly amusing. Dad is proud of the giant power lines going through his property, and sees them as an inspirational ""reminder of man's ability to generate electricity,"" and is constantly amazed at Mom's talent for cooking special dishes, such as chicken... WITH SEASONINGS!I would compare this movie to Raising Arizona or Cold Comfort Farm. The laughs are numerous, but you are not force-fed. I certainly found things I had missed the first time during my second viewing, and expect to pick up more the next time. Just listening to their Australian voices is hilarious.The language gets a little rough, which is the only reason I would not recommend this movie for my mother-in-law or my early-teen nieces and nephews."
4,Viewed a while ago on Australian turf - Very Funny,"I saw this movie on regular television while traveling in Australia - It's hilarious. The basic plot is about a family that is being forced to move out of its ""castle"" because of an airport's expansion. The entire family, especially the father, is very loving and UNsophisticated bunch. The father has no concept of politics and lawyers - he only knows that he shouldn't be forced to move from his home. The way this basic and likable family takes on the government and big business makes for a great movie."
2,Left a lot to be desired,"This movie aimed a what Ayn Rand dubbed as ""a selective concretization of man's metaphysical values."" In essenece, the storyline aimed to depict a position of an issue that was very admirable -- the forcable expropriation of private property by the government. However, this is in direct contrast with the actual philosophical purpose of the government -- the protection of property. In that respect, I believed that the movie fulfilled the goal of projecting a very serious problem.However, while its intended projection might be admirable, the execution of this ideal was shoddy, sloppy and incomplete. From the very poor cinematography (I thought this movie was from the 80's if not for the reference to the full monty) to the laughably terrible jokes (no pun intended), this movie, in essence, mocks that which it aims to defend. The movie was too short, and didnt come through in humor or seriousness. The Castle is more like a slum."
3,The most depressing collection I've ever read,"OMG This was the most depressing book I have ever read! I understand Sapphire's goal, and I'm not knocking it at all. It's well written and put together. All the poems are properly sequenced and they VIVIDLY tell the story of the abuse in homes across the world. You could easily insert any girl into the shoes of the characters portrayed in American Dreams. It's a sad reality that Sapphire has opened the world up to. I applaud her, but I felt bombarded by the images she depicted. Maybe that was her goal. If so, she succeeded. Im thoroughly disgusted. I could look at my boyfriend without disgust for a whole week after reading this book!After reading American Dreams I couldnt look at any man without wondering if he had, or would ever sexually abuse a child."
1,This isn't what it says it is,"Instead of the Underdark Adventure Guide, this book is a sourcebook for Morningstar, a fantasy campaign setting. It has nothing to do with Drow, or Mind Flayers, or the Underdark.I can't speak to the quality of the book, except to say that this isn't what I meant to purchase."
5,"Excellent for stomach aches, nausea.",I grew up taking cola syrup for stomach aches and especially for nausea. I swear by this product. It works wonders!
3,Farcry,"Good actioner,i was never bored from it. The acting and special effects are what you would expect from a movie like this. I liked the chemistry between Emmanuelle Vaugier and Til Schweiger. I believe Emmanuelle Vaugier could have been used more though, her character was just playing the damsel in distress role. All in all, entertaining enough to see."
4,Terminator-The Sarah Connor Chronicles-Complete First Season (Blu Ray),Terminator - The Sarah Connor Chronicles - The Complete First Season [Blu-ray] Great performances and lots of fun. If you enjoy the Terminator movies give this a shot. Lena Headey in this series gives Linda Hamilton a run for her money as the mother trying to protect her only child from termination. Summer Glau is great as a Terminator. Don't miss this show but you must see it on Blu Ray to get the full effect.
1,I can't believe people actually liked this!,"I watched about 20 minutes of the pilot before I had to turn it off. It's horrible, it almost made me sick. Picture crossing a brutally awesome sci-fi/action story, with some wholesome afterschool special. They tried to make the show both violent and ""awsesome"", while also making it cute and funny. It made me want to barf, what an awful idea. I can't vouch for the rest of the season because I didn't make it that far.... I am seriously shocked that nobody else voted this one down...I'd say if you are into the dumber US TV shows (you know who you are), you'd probably be into this, but if you have a brain and were even SOMEWHAT interested in the original Terminator story, watching this is a painful experience. I'm only talking about the storyline/acting, the 1080p transfer and the disc extras are probably great, but I wouldn't know.I was a big fan of the first two Terminator movies, but this does not compare at all - stay away from this one."
4,Highly recommended!,"At the Amazon price, this is a great value. I enjoyed watching the entire first year series without interruption and picked up on some things I had missed. Not much in the way of extras, but that was okay with me."
5,terminator with new life,Great show Have only watch the first 6 episodes but already completely drawn to the show. loved the four movies and love the show.
4,Great Show In Style With The Terminator Movies,"Even with only 9 episodes, this first season of the Sarah Conner Chronicles is a blast. Combining great action, with great drama. Can't wait to watch the second and hopefully even more seasons of this great show."
2,Worth a watch BUT...,"This spin off series takes where T2 left off and that's one problem because no matter if u liked T3 or not T3 HAPPENED and you just can't ignore it.Problem #2 is the absense of the REAL sarah connor. Where is linda hamilton ? (Not to speak of...Arnie).I Reccomend this series ONLY to the die hard ""terminator"" fans."
2,Looks Nice,The lid comes off occasionally. It doesn't quite fit the base properly. I will need to glue it to the base.
5,Possibly the best electric guitar player out there,"I bought this album on the recommendation of posts here. They're quite right. Koch is no mindless shredder but has more ideas going on here than the entire Shrapnel roster. I havent heard a more rounded and versatile player since Steve Morse, who's the nearest I can compare him with, plus throw in a bit of Steve Vai, Allan Holdsworth, Danny Gatton, Roy Buchanan and the Hellecasters.Even though 'Grip' is instrumental, there's enough here of interest for non-guitarists. Do not be put off. Malmsteen he aint. Possibly the best electric guitar player in the world right now... and that includes Vai, Satriani, Malmsteen, Holdsworth..."
2,Was great for a few years and then it stopped working,"I wish I had read more reviews for this radio. If you want something that lasts, this isn't it. It worked fine for the first 4 years and then it worked some days and not others and then it completely died."
1,worst radio I have ever owned!,"This is the worst radio I've ever owned. The AM band tuner is terrible; it can't distinguish between 2 stations at 1240 & 1260; with the 1240 transmitter about 10 miles away and 1260 about 30 miles away, 1240 covers up 1260. FM band reception is poor. My new unit,replacing the Dual 6820, pulls in many more stations clearly. I bought this unit 4 1/2 years ago; the CD player part just crapped out. For comparison, the stock radio in my 98 Prelude lasted 7 years. The faceplate lights are way too bright, objectionable & dangerously so; I'm 62 not 16. Engineering failed to include a headlights on dimmer here, so I used 3 thickness of paper to block the light. Power is barely adequate to drive the stock 6 speaker setup; my new replacement will rattle the windows, for less money than I paid for the Dual. I repeat - This Dual 6820 is the worst unit I've ever owned; so much so that I will NEVER buy another Dual product."
3,It has its moments...,"Don't get me wrong, the first 45 minuntes of this movie is great. Funny as heck, and it even has Little Richard (""the only talent in this movie"") in it, but I just can't stick with the movie after that. Sorry. But rest assured, that this is the only MST3K that I have seen that is like this."
5,Finally There is a Great Disneyland Book,"This is a must-have for everyone who visits Disneyland, or like me, a big fan of the place. I have learned so much more from this book than I have from the others. I recommend this book to everyone."
1,Great Effort poor printquality and poor photography,"Christopher Baker might fancy himself a photographer, but in this book, he overreached himself. Poor photography technique and lack of skills are evident throughout all of the pictures. You name it, composition, shooting into bright light causing almost everything in the image to be underexposed, out of focus, flash set wrong, depth of field off, its just plain horrible. luckily I didn't pay too much for it. Soon I hope I can go and take better pictures. Don't spend any money on this book. There's better out there. BTW the print quality is also wretched, paper is not thick enough or the right type, so it all has a weird wrinkled feel to it."
2,Fills with Water!,"People here are saying that this little thing is accurate, and I believe them because I have no clue to tell. But when I buy something, I do not want it only to give me accurate reading, but I expect it also to be well manufactured, and unfortunately, this little thing is not. It allows the faucet to leak water, and once water is leaked, this thing is filled with water in no time-in addition to all the mess caused by leaking. I just do not get it, they cannot fix something simple like this and seal the housing, or at least make a quality attachment to forbid water from leaking."
5,"Good Item, good price, 100% recommendable","This is one of a dozen things I have bought at amazon.com and all is 100 % recommendable, sure thing."
1,Cutomer Service???,"Came missing a lot of pieces (all of the reflectors and the rear brakes), directions were difficult to read."
1,do not buy,"This tourniquet is supposedly big enough for a thigh, yet it barely fits around my calf. It's not even stretchy enough to constrict an arm properly. Forget about buying this. The instructions also talk about wrapping it around your 'thumb', meaning wherever this came from in China has no clue what they're doing."
2,Disappointing,"Okay, I was disappointed with this one. I bought this specifically because the music was Christian. I figured it would inspire me to exercise more often because I love Christian music. Well, only part of the music is Christian songs that I recognize (and I know a lot of songs). Even worse, the instructional and encouraging voice-overs are so much louder than the music that the music disappears into the background. Truthfully, I've used it only 3 times since buying it months ago. On the positive side, the instructions are clear and easy to follow. This is definitely aimed at the over-50 crowd who has been sedentary. The steps are easy to follow and include arm swings and side-to-side movement as well as regular walking."
4,Binder Clips fix RX8 visor,These inexpensive clips saved me over $500 to fix some visors on an RX8 that were splitting apart. Exactly what they said they were. High quality and low price allowing me to solve a complicated problem.
5,Soft side of the rock,"Had a chance to meet Ferron at the KIMO Theatre in Albuquerque, New Mexico...unfortunately did not get to hear her...but my best friend got me an autographed CD which I just heard for the first time moments ago...it's beautiful...wise...a piece of sanity...the soft side of the rock! Like ""Life is a Brook"" from Stll Riot, if ""Goat Path"" doesn't wring it out of you, you must be heartless."
2,Weak,"Only ONE track from Pretzel Logic??? WTF? Even with only one disc to work with, that's inexcusable. Get the two-disc ""Showbiz Kids"" which is a much better compilation, or better yet, make your own. There's nothing ""definitive"" about this ill-considered package."
4,Great book by a thinking man. Intelligent Design is better than Evolution!,"""Will Evolve For Food""...I keep hoping tosee an ape or man in an ape suit holdinga sign on a street corner with one! We seeso many people with 'Will Work for Food'signs that it'd be nice to see someonegoing after Big Brother for the EvolutionHoax! Intellignet Design is a breath offresh air in the Creation / EvolutionDebate. Behe makes the best case to datefor Intelligent Design. Pick Up On It!"
1,"badly researched, argument goes nowhere","Behe's argument boils down to a complaint that he can't imagine the last evolutionary step leading up to certain complex biochemical systems. Well, that's not terribly surprising since he's a protein chemist, not an evolutionary biologist. Basically he went and wrote a book outside his own field of expertise without doing his homework. He makes a big point out of how there have been absolutely no papers published about huge areas of biochemical evolution, but he's just wrong (see, e.g., responses at http://www.world-of-dawkins.com/box/behe.htm).And even if one was ready to buy his argument that there was a problem with biochemical evolution, what he's proposing is to admit faith-based reasoning into science. What's going to happen next -- will scientific papers have to be peer-reviewed by witch doctors? Will we have to start considering whether astronomy research is consistent with astrology? Will geology papers be reviewed by flat-earthers?"
5,"A controversial, engaging, compelling science read",Behe has done a superb job of marshalling and presenting evidence of intelligent design. This book is surprisingly enjoyable to read
1,"Orgel's second rule: ""Evolution is clever than you are""","It's certainly clever than Michael Behe's arguments in this creationist tract.His ""argument from irreducible complexity"" is just the ""argument from personal incredulity"" all over again. Fawned over by other creationists, this book simply isn't science; not a single paper faced peer review. And a good thing for Behe, since the irreducible complexity that he claims to disprove evolution with is actually fully expected and accounted for by neo-Darwinism."
3,Good questions. Experimental tests of his own hypothesis?,"A key phrase in an earlier review says it all: Behe ""goes on to propose a potential resolution of this flaw, namely intelligent design.""I agree that conducting physical tests for the hypothesis of intelligent design is an important path for scientific investigation of our biological origins. I encourage Behe and his colleagues to propose and implement those tests, and I look forward to reading reports on such experiments in future books about the intelligent-design hypothesis.I also look forward to reading reports on experiments that test further refinements to the theory of evolution by natural selection, which is still neither perfect nor dead, at this point.At this point, the physical evidence simply does not rule out either of these potential explanations. We still have a lot of work to do, and our descendants may yet look back at both of these hypotheses with amusement.Search on!"
4,The evidence is here.,"I wish rational people could look beyond all the steaming piles of polemics written in the ""Creationism vs. Darwinism"" debate and see the evidence that Mr. Behe has brought to the table. Let us move past our entrenched dogmatic positions and seek the truth. I feel Mr. Behe has made a very strong case for intelligent design. I hope others will at least have the honesty to give the evidence fair consideration. If you are one of those people, I encourage you to buy this book."
1,Huh?,"This book doesn't fit the ""science"" category...Nothing new, just same old ""design theory"" (disguised with ""biochemistry"") that even Victorians wouldn't have excepted...dah."
1,Fundamentally flawed.,"This guy would make a lousy detective. I wouldn't want to have someone who thinks like this working for the police department in my city. Every time he'd encounter a case he couldn't solve, he'd simply throw up his hands and say, ""I can't figure this case out. Therefore, it must be irreducibly complex. That means God did it. Let's get a warrant for His arrest."""
1,Biochemical Challenge,"There's no need to be wordy.1. Biochemistry is a natural science2. Natural science is defined as the ""the rational study of the universe via rules or laws of natural order""3. Intelligent design impliesA) Extraterrestrial design-- unlikely, although possibleB) Some nonphysical entity4. If B, we are no longer in the realm of scienceEven if Behe or proponent of ID feel Darwinian evolution to be inadequate, for an alternative proposal to be called scientific, it must be ""based on observable, empirical, measurable evidence, and subject to laws of reasoning"".This is basic scientic method. I learned it in middle school. Behe perhaps needs to be retaught.Source: wikipedia[...]"
3,"Thought provoking, but ultimately flawed","I read this book early in my science career when some of the mechanisms of evolution were not quite as well understood, so looking back on it I realize that Dr. Behe was a little bit narrow in his assertions about irreducible complexity. The biggest problem that I have with it is that he shows no experimental data to give credence to his claims, and ultimately perpetuates the misunderstanding the difference between a theory and a hypothesis. The theory of evolution has over a century of experimental data to support it, while this book asserts an untested hypothesis. Herein lies the difference between science and philosophy."
1,not science - just religion in disguise (or maybe astrology),"This is not really science. If there were anything of real scientific value to this, Behe would be in line for Nobel Prize for discrediting evolutionary accounts in biochemistry. But, in fact, he is considered a crackpot by the scientific community. He points out some aspects of biochemistry, which he claims are not explainable via evolution. 1) his claims have been roundly clobbered by other scientists as being untrue 2) even if something has not been explained does not mean it is ""unexplainable"" in principle. This whole argument has been around since William Paley in the 1800s- there is nothing new here. Behe is the guy who spoke in favor of Intelligent Design in Dover PA - the same guy who admitted that if his concept of science were accepted, astrology could be considered science."
1,Falls short and misrepresents evolution,"I expected better from a professional Biochemist. While Behe accepts many tenants underlying the theory of evolution (e.g., an ancient earth, common descent from a primordial ancestor)--which are clearly supported by hard data--he proposes that there are some things that are unexplainable by evolutionary means. Essentially, it is a ""God of the Gaps"" argument, in that which cannot be explained by naturalistic evolutionary changes, must be due to God.Unfortunately, what Behe claims to be unexplainable by Science are simply things that are not yet explained. Just because an defendable explaination has not yet been found doesn't mean that one will not be found in the future. Furthermore, many of his arguments betray a lack of understanding of the theory he criticises, or boil down to a cavelier dismissal of alternate theories."
1,"Please enter the 21st Century ,you stupid fundaMENTALists!!",More drivel from the peanut gallery !!!!!!!DARWIN was right!!!YOU WANT THE TRUTH ? YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH!!!!! I read this book it su didley ucks!!!!!!
4,Interesting Argument,"Michael Behe provides a very interesting argument for the impact of microbiology on the intelligent design debate. With recent courtcases this issue is back in the spotlight and more people will be reading Behe's book to find some answers.The most interesting feature of ""Darwin's Black Box"" are the examples of complexity in living organisms into which Behe delves. I was fascinated by the author's description of the process of how blood clots or does not clot depending on the presence or absence of a huge number of chemicals in the body. I appreciated the chart relating the reactions of the various chemicals to each other.Whether you agree or disagree with the author's conclusions about the significance of the examples he gives, you cannot disagree that his examples are worth looking into. This book is very thought-provoking and relevant.As a lover of science and as a person who is interested in this debate, I recommend Michael Behe's book."
1,Why buy a book about something the author now admits is wrong?,"In the Kitzmiller v. Dover decision the Court noted that ""Professor Behe admitted in ""Reply to My Critics"" that there was a defect in his view of irreducible complexity because, while it purports to be a challenge to natural selection, it does not actually address ""the task facing natural selection."""" [and] ""Professor Behe specifically explained that ""[t]he current definition [of irreducible complexity] puts the focus on removing a part from an already functioning system,"" but ""[t]he difficult task facing Darwinian evolution, however, would not be to remove parts from sophisticated pre-existing systems; it would be to bring together components to make a new system in the first place."" Id. In that article, Professor Behe wrote that he hoped to ""repair this defect in future work;"" however, he has failed to do so even four years after elucidating his defect.""In other words, the only thing that Irreducible Complexity proved was to be wrong."
3,"Not the final word (of course), but has good insights.","Another gem, from the reviewer of March 8, 1997:""Evolution and belief in God are not antithetical.""Quite so. There is no need for ""all or nothing"" thinking in either direction.-dubhghall"
1,Unscientific Twaddle,"What a shame that this unscientific twaddle is the only type of exposure to Darwinism many people will ever have.David Hume hit it right on the mark: ""The gazing populace receive greedily, without examination, whatever soothes superstition and promotes wonder."""
1,Of No Use For Any Christian,"This book is a self-described paraphrase of the Rule of Saint Benedict (in most references, minus the ""Saint"" - one can only wonder why). I found the removal of God and His replacement by the author with what really boils down to the god of this world to be emblematic of the whole book: it is an insult to Saint Benedict and to his heritage; to Christianity from which it sprung; to any and all who seek in any way, great or small to live the ideals of the *Christian* life which Saint Benedict espoused and taught. It is neither what Saint Benedict wrote nor what he taught, nor what he practiced - because it removes God and Christianity from the picture and replaces it with platitudes which have no anchor."
4,Nice Selection,"This album contains some of the best contemporary Christian wedding songs. As performers, we often find it difficult to find appropriate music for religious services. However, we have sung several of the selections on this CD and found them meaningful and appropriate.Our favorites include ""I Will Be Here"" and ""In this Very Room."" But there are several other good ones.Be aware, however, that there are TWO versions of this recording! One contains the lyrics and the other does not. Be sure you are ordering the right one!"
4,Oly C-700 UZ,"This is not the ""point & shoot"" camera for everyone. There is a serious amount of lens on this light little camera! -I'm a rather shaky person (too many electrocutions) so it was nearly impossible to get an auto focused picture until I put it on a tripod. -I am impressed with the quality of my pictures now.The software in the package isn't very impressive, but it does have a nice quick crop tool that keeps your camera settings in the picture file. -A handy bit of info when you're trying to master the manual settings and have a few good quality ""accidental"" (I mean Auto) photos on your hard drive.A higher resolution would have been nice for landscapes etc. -The power of the optics makes up for the lower resolution on smaller subject matter though. (Who needs pixels if you have zoom)If you've worked with lower resolution digital cameras you'll find yourself running out of disk space in a hurry. -Get a 128 MB card for it."
4,"Best Digital, tho not Perfect","++++ 10x zoom and light weight were real sellers. Great for hiking, animals, portraits, macro. Amazing to take pics, download, crop or lighten if needed, and pop out prints size desired in minutes. Save $ and aggrevation on film developing. Don't need to feel restricted about picture-taking--easy to delete.---- Slow! If you wanted to take a pic of your dog running, you'll get a pic of his butt! Between time clicked and shutter goes off, dog has turned away. $ saved on developing will be spent on better paper and ink cartridges. You'll need 2 sets rechargeable batteries and 2 memory cards. Each frame you save needs named, ie: rose1, rose2. Had a lot of trouble getting computer to recognize and had to call tech line; was told a way that wasn't in manual. But I'm way past that now. Several instructions in manual were incomplete.I'm a pretty heavy 35mm/telephoto photographer and this is my 1st digital. I do love it, but I still need 35mm for good action shots."
2,10x zoom sharp only in bright light or with tripod,"I bought this camera because of the 10x optical zoom, which you just don't find on consumer-quality digital cameras. Alas, now I know why. It's almost impossible to hold the camera still enuf to get a clear picture at maximum zoom unless it's in bright sunlight (quick exposure) or you're using a tripod--quick 10x zoom shots in less than perfect light are almost always a little blurred. No image stabilization like in the nicer video cameras. If I had it to do over again, I would have bought the highest megapixels I could (now there are some that are 4+ megapixels) and a 3x optical zoom. That way, I'd have the sharpest pix, and a reasonable chance of getting a sharp zoomed in shot, even tho it wouldn't be as close as the 10x."
5,Love this Camera,"I looked at quite a few.... I love the ease of this camera, the easy to read menus, and especially the 10X zoom.I like to take pictures of flowers and still lifes and this camera does everything I want it to..... Love it. I am having so much fun."
1,NTSC versus PAL !,"I have already sent you a message, saying that I couldn't watch this film under satisfactory conditions, because my DVD reader cannot read the NTSC standard.It would be very nice if the purchaser could know that sort of detail beforehand.Sincerely yours,Jean-Pierre Renard"
5,Good material,This book told me what I needed to know. I wanted to be able to troubleshoot some old telephones. I collect old payphones and had a few that didn't work. They do now. I rate the book highly.
4,Quaint and Interesting,"I stumbled upon this book after reading a response to a post I made on Piano World. The author is treating the piano in a manner that I am as I write a book except that he did not have access to a high speed computer and Matlab. I also liked his humorous, sometimes self deprecating writing style."
3,Ok,the friend I gave this to loved it. I saw it and thought it could have been better. Paper thin and not many stickers
4,Great Baby Book Alternative,"This is my second Baby Calender. I received one for my first son and I filled it in completely. I love calendars and I would look at and fill it in each day unlike his very nice expensive baby book which is still mostly empty (he is 2years 3months). I purchased this one, since I couldn't find one like my first one, and i love it so far. I do wish it had pockets for each month like my first one did but that is the only downfall. It is very beautiful and has lots of stickers and room to write. Each month has the same topics to fill in and will not be aplicable each month so I just write my own thoughs and ignore the topic suggestions."
5,Early Ray Charles at his best,"If you want a taste of what influenced & shaped Ray Charles then this is it.All of the pre-Atlantic recordings-pre dating What I'd Say, Mess Around & I've Got A Woman.This is Ray in his pseudo Nat King Cole phase & he does it better than Nat (which yes is a stretch to purists.)songs like Baby Won't You Please Come Home show case him at his essential Nat.fast forward to song 8 The Snow Is Falling & you can hear he is searching for his own voice, which he eventually will find.Any way you cut it this is Ray Charles that YOU NEED IN YOUR COLLECTION. TRUE FANS WILL BUY IT even the curious listener who wants an early introduction to Ray & his roots will enjoy it.I highly recommend this collection it is a great addition to any Ray Collection."
5,The Wakefields leaving Sweet Valley or not?,"it is the end of the school year and The Wakefields are moving to Utah.Elizabeth wants to know if Salvadore is the one for her. Jessica is heartbroken about leaving Damon. Lacey is happy that Jessica is moving to Utah so,she can have Kristen all to herself. Someone organizes a party for the Wakefields Good-bye. Mr.Wakefield announces that The family isn't moving."
3,Organizm,"Organizm is a pretty solid movie that suffers from two problems. The movie contradicts itself at times, and some of the most atrocious CGI and green screen work I have ever seen. Bad CGI usually doesn't bother me because its par for the course in low budget movies, but it is just so bad that it deterred me from fully enjoying the movie. And another problem is that the movie seemed to have some sort of budget because everything else about it was pretty good, so the CGI issue really is unforgivable. Now thus far it may seem as though I'm bashing the movie, but I did enjoy it. In fact, if the CGI had been in the hands of more competent individuals, then this would have received a four star rating easily. But as it stands, we are left with a nice Sci-Fi / Horror time killer worthy of watching, but just don't expect the next classic here."
1,Awful,I cant say anymore. I only watched a minute. I like sci fi but this wasn't even that. It just awful and junk. What more can I say.
2,Poor design,"These nipples do have a large X shaped hole at the end. I see that one reviewer disputes this, but that must have been an older version. My son will not use these, so this was was a wasted purchase. He uses the Avent and Gerber nipples just fine.I purchased these in order to use the non-bpa glass bottles. Maybe the medium sized nipples would work, but I'm not willing to take that chance..."
3,Disappointing,"It was nice to see EA trying to improve on the graphics and realism of the game. But the gameplay is horrible. It's very hard to control the players and the ball. The shooting is child-like almost. I'm a huge Euro and soccer fan, which is what keeps me into this game, but again, the gameplay is terrible. EA should send their game designers back to school."
3,FIFA 2004 is better,"I am not particularly impressed with this release. I play the FIFA 2004 on XBOX too and I think it is much better in terms of response and shots on target.For some reason, even the highly rated players (Del Piero, Ronaldo, Trezeguet etc) seem to always shoot wide. This release does not quite encourage sprinting. Sprinting is a good feature for the strikers. Overall, the bells and whistles do not make up of the loss in functionality."
2,Average - Just Average,"While I somewhat agree with the post that some of the reviews for this musical are a bit harsh, I have to also question the five star reviews. Do these people work for the show itself? The music is fair at best - no songs particularly memorable in my opinion, but simply average. Last year's winner for Best Score (""Light In The Piazza"") is much, much better. Even the music for fluff like ""The Wedding Singer"" is more memorable.Maybe the show itself is more interesting than some/most of this season's offerings, but aren't these ratings supposed to be for the cd (music) as opposed to the stage production? I believe there are other venues, such as the NY Times, for that."
5,Wow!!! An Amazing Home Run,"Not much you can say about ""The Drowsy Chaperone"" other than to say ""buy it and enjoy the heck out of it."" It's a spoof, a real spoof with an incredible cast, all of whom project their roles quite well to disk. I was fortunate enough to see it. Sutton Foster, always amazing, is at her awesome best. Her ""Show Off"" number is one of the funniest and most physicallhy demanding numbers I have seen in years. The Tony voters should once again hang their heads in shape over their inherent stupidity. The rest of the cast is equally good, and I found myself whistling many of the tunes over and over. It good, it's funny and it's listenable. I rate it as one of my better purchases of the past year."
1,Just Horrible.,"How tacky can a show be? This show is supposed to be ""funny"" by making fun of other musicals that didn't enjoy success on Broadway. That is my definition of tacky. Even worse if the show has horrible music. There is a song about a monkey! Do I need to say more?I also was unlucky enough to catch the Original Broadway Cast at the Marquis Theatre, thank god the show was only 90 minutes long! It felt like days."
1,Simply Painful,"With the exception of one or two songs, this cd made me cringe. Simply painful to the ears."
5,Real Art,"This is a fabulous documentary reproduction of a 1912 recording of the great Armenian priest and musicologist. This unusual music is so intense and refined in its composition and execution that it is difficult to listen to anything contemporary for some time afterward. The quality of the recording is unfortunately not what could be hoped for; still, even to have the recordings at all is a blessing. When I first received it, I listened to it 3 or 4 times, each time feeling the songs more deeply than before. This emotional experience has gotten me interested in all things Armenian."
5,"Truly a ""one recording on a dessert island"" choice!","This recording of some of John Rutter's choral music is truly exquisite. The disc features the ""Gloria,"" as well as a number of his church anthems, accompanied by either brass & organ, orchestra, or sung a cappella. From the opening fanfare of the ""Gloria"" to the last ethereal chord of ""The Lord Bless You and Keep You,"" this disc shines with choral and compositional beauty. In the opinion of this reviewer, this is the cream of Rutter's work over the last 20+ years. The performances of the Cambridge Singers are superb, especially when they leave the orchestra behind and sing unaccompanied. Particularly high praise goes to ""Open Thou Mine Eyes."" But whether a glorious accompanied anthem, or the intimacy of the unaccompanied choral prayer, this disc will delight you from beginning to end. Guaranteed!"
5,Nice Product!,"I was not actually looking for this high quality of a product. I usually buy the rubber tubed hose. I saw this one, braided with stainless steel, for the same price I could buy the rubber one in a store. This was a simple no-brainer for a better product."
4,Wonderful performances,"Both Barry Manilow and Annette O'Toole do a wonderful acting job. The music is, of course, incredible. The video quality of the DVD is not as great as I would have expected but it's still good. If you're a Barry Manilow fan you will love this DVD, especially Who Needs To Dream and I'm In Love Again."
1,depressing view of ADD,I DON'T THINK THAT I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO MANY - IT'S GRIM AND MAKES YOU FEEL HOPELESS. yOU GET A SENSE THAT THERE ARE ALOT OF CRAZY PEOPLE RUNNING AROUND THE WORLD.NOT MUCH FUN OR PRACTICAL HELP.
4,Would recommend,This is great for camping. My coleman grill fits perfectly into the bottom. The only thing I don't like is that the sides are not supported. So when you digging around in your bag you have to fight with the sides collapsing all over where you are trying to look. It would be alot nicer if there was some sort of support to the bag.
4,Coleman Camper's Storage Bag,This bag is really big and sturdy. However as others have stated it does not hold itself up. that being the inside does not have walls and anything that you put inside will collapse onto itself. As for just storing stuff and organizing it's a good product and you can store your coleman 2 burner stove in it's zippered bottom.
3,Great Idea! Not Great Design!,"My husband and I bought this as a way to keep all our camping cooking stuff together. His two burner Coleman stove fits perfectly in the bottom pocket and the top pocket holds just about everything we need (dishes, pots/pans, dishtowels etc.) There really is a lot of space. There are elastic pockets on the inside that hold propane bottles, utensils etc.Now the part we don't like. There is no support on in this bag. We thought this would be like the collapsible coolers, where the sides would have some sort of padding to help hold the shape. There is no support. If we don't fill it completely full, everything just slides all over the place.We are happy with it overall and will be using it, but thought it could have a much better design."
4,Good value,"The product arrived earlier than expected and was well packaged, so it was in good condition with nothing missing. Assembly was fairly easy and my only minor issue was that the backing board was quite flimsy. My bookcases have been in place for a few weeks and they are holding up quite well. I am very satisfied with the product!!"
4,looks like expensive furniture,WE bought this bookcase after long consideration and never regret the decision. This bookcase looks as high quality furniture.One con-a bit difficult to put together because of unclear instructions.
5,Very good quality,"I was very impressed with the quality of these bookcases. Very solid. Went together well. I ordered 2 bookcases and attached them. The first one was so heavy getting it up the stairs, I built the second one upstairs in the room it was going and that worked out better. The seller was amazingly fast at responding to my request for 2 damaged parts."
5,"Magnificently engrossing novel, finest kind","Entirely involving, entertaining and nuanced (that's the new adjective, right?) novel about Hollywood (woo-hoo) during the HUAC witchhunt. Some might call this book a soap-opera but, would that be so bad? Most everything the revered Faulkner wrote is not only soap opera but, gasp, Southern Gothic Soap Opera. LOVED this book which brings back to public consciousness a black period for the U.S. and for democracy and discusses it with a grey palette. Wonderful, exquisite, consuming reading. Well written, with very knowing eye and irony; it's a DO-NOT-MISS-BOOK!"
1,Awful,"I'm a wrestling fan, a Blassie fan, a Kaufman fan, and agree that My Dinner with Andre could use a good spoof. Somehow all of that didn't come together in this terrible waste of time. I was bored to death, fell asleep, and woke up with a headache. Don't waste your time - you can't even sleep through it without pain."
5,The Tom Waits Of Comedy,"Although I've been a closet-fan of Andy (Primarily because of the lack of exposure before the recent media blitz) for years, its only been because of the ""Man On The Moon"" hype that my local stores have offered Andy Kaufman videos. This video is true art. Staged or not, its pure brilliance, from the female autograph seekers to the discussion of French Toast and Waffles to the bizarre mohawked-Kaufman scenes...Lemme aks ya dis....Why Carrey and not Nicolas Cage, to portray Andy? While I'm not Anti-Carrey, no one but Cage could come close to Andy's mannerisms and eerie stare (For proof, please see I'M FROM HOLLYWOOD). Except of course for Son Of Sam gunman Davey Berkowitz, who is nearly Andy's spittin' image. And yes I'm sure Tom Waits is a fan."
4,"Good Price, Good Item","I was pleased overall with this item, the outside case looked brand new, and the discs all play perfectly. The only problem is that one of the disc holders inside the case is broken so the disc slides around in the case. However, this was not a bad enough damage to return the item, and I would buy from this dealer again.It took a long time for the package to arrive, but after tracking through USPS, I realized it was because the post office misrouted the package, and this was not the fault of the seller, who mailed the package in a timely manner."
2,Great Season but Paramount did a crumby job,"This was one of my favorite seasons of Frasier...mainly for 2 episodes.Disc 4's Agents in America with Fraiser's agent BeBe Glaser played by a hillarious Harriet Sansom Harris. I wish they had put her in more episodes. The other is Disc 1's the Matchmaker, where Frasier's gay boss thinks that Frasier is romantically interested. And also is under the impression that Frasier's father and brother are also gay.Major compalint: The major complaint I have has to do with Paramount's idiotic navigation. There is no ""Watch all episodes"" navigation on the discs, like other TV show DVD have. So when each episode is done you have to click on what episode you want to view next, rather than just watching each one without having to use the clicker. It is aggrivating. For this, I give the DVD 2 stars, not the series."
4,A+,"Arrived quickly and in good condition. Tiny scratch on the front of the case, but nothing major. All discs played well and were in good condition. Very happy with purchase :D"
1,"ok,but no ""CHEERS""","""Frasier"" is ok, but it's no ""CHEERS"". ""CHEERS"" is the best, and ""Frasier"" is just a carbon copy. Enough said."
5,Frasier reigns supreme!,"For absolute out loud belly laughs you must see Frasier!It is very intelligent comedy, keep on watching the episodes over and over again, because every time there is something else you laugh about. Sharp, witty comedy. Stylish and sophisticated.For me Frasier is the top comedy show, followed closely by the Golden Girls and Will & Grace. The rest can only lower their heads in shame!Fantastic! Cannot wait for the thrid season to be released on DVD!!"
1,Not even close,"This book is nothing more than real world examples of statistics, which in an of itself is truly a good thing. However, the title of this book is ""Interpreting BASIC STATISTICS"". No one, absolutley NO ONE who is a beginner (and hence someone who would need BASIC statistic knowledge) should ever purchase this hideous book.Obviously the author just wanted another book published and those who consulted the author, especially the ""professor emeritus"" should be completely ashamed of their participation."
5,Great road trip music!!,"Danny Gatton is a Wonderful guitar player. He can play anything in his own unique firey style but does seem to lean more to a Jazz sound. I hadn't really listened to that much of his music until a couple years ago. This is one of the first cds of his I bought and actually it's a very good place to start. It has 2 full cds of some of his best and it sounds really excellent too. Right after I bought this, I took a several hundred mile trip to Mammoth with a friend and we both heard this cd for the first time. The miles flew by with this great cd. Since then I have bought everyone of Danny's cds, that I have been able to find."
4,Fantastic Variety Guitar Music,"I have to admit that I'm bias,I really enjoy Danny Gatton's music,but I'll try to be as impartial as possible.Danny is one of America's greatist unknown guitarist that ever lived,god rest his soul.Danny is extremely versatile.This album,2 CD set has alot of everything that Danny did,with differant versions of his other pieces so it's not the ""same ol' stuff""!I'm listening to it now while I write this to be as accurate as possible.There's some rockabilly,some soft jazz,some hard jazz,some country,someharder rock and some,as I call it,humorous muic such as 'Lucy and Linus',and 'The Simpsons'.If your a Danny Gatton fan and was able to see Danny perform live like I have,or even if you didn't but appreciate his music,or a big fan of GOOD guitar music,I certainly do highly recommend this one!"
2,"Great guitar, bad Lite Jazz","I found this in a used CD shop. I had a vague sense of who Danny is, and the liner notes had me excited. Rockabilly, blues, jazz, bluegrass, looked great!Indeed the sections where he lets it rip are fantastic. Unfortunately many of the songs are arranged in a 70s-lite-jazz style with peppy, bouncy horns, etc. Like another reviewer below, I kept forwarding thru the tracks looking for something that smokes. A few tracks satisfy (when Danny cuts loose he's amazing), but there's too much pseudo-jazz-junkola for my taste."
2,nighttime,"wasn't impressed with this cd.it wasn't what i thought the songs would sound like.if you are fan of them, then purchase it."
3,Johnson Acculine-Pro 40-6522,"Upon receipt the battery charge light seemed to work but after 15 hours of charging it never went to Green. Upon inspection, the plug could be moved out maybe a 16th of an inch and it would turn to green. Push back in and it went red as if requiring a charge. (Via e-mail) Customer service thought possibley a short. I was leaving for trip out of state anticipating using the equipment. I was hoping customer service would offer to next day a replacement. They suggested returning it if it would not hold a charge. I will return it for a replacement when I return."
4,Tri-Core Cervical Pillow,"I have used a Tri-Core Cervical Pillow for a few years that I acquired from a Chiropractor. I ordered 2 of these, one for my wife.We both like to use them."
4,"Great Pillow, Just takes a little get used to","I have to agree with some of the reviews that say the pillow is difficult to get used to. By the third night, I thought I would not be able to deal with my new sleeping arrangement. But by the 5-6th night I realized I was no longer waking up with headaches. Now I can't sleep on anything else except for this pillow.I have been informed that you will need to replace the pillow every 18 months or so, and that if you wash it in the washing machine you will need to throw a shoe in the dryer along with it to keep it fluffy (?)I guess that's true of any pillow??I do feel as though this pillow is more comfortable for back sleepers. I like to sleep on my side, but the pillow isn't as comfortable. I have TMJ so it could be that I am just not meant to sleep on the side of my face.Anyhow, waking up with headaches has decreased significantly! I would recommend this pillow. Stick with it the first the week and you will see the pillow is worth the trial."
2,It's too thick for my neck,"I was in a car accident a few years ago and have had neck and upper back problems since. I have tried many pillows to try to get a good night's sleep since my neck pain prevents me from sleeping all night. I was so excited to get this pillow after reading all the positive reviews. It is great if I were to lay on my back all night, but I don't. It is not comfortable for me if I lay on my side. It is too thick and not soft (but it keeps it shape better because of that). I guess I will continue the search for something that works."
5,Great Pillow,"If you have neck problems or spine probelms, give it a try It worked very well and helped my girl friend who had been through neck surgery. She sleeps with it every night and will buy it again when it eventually wears out. It is well worth the money. Her pain level went from a 5 to a 2."
5,Tri-core standard,was hard at first but I son became used to it and it has helped my neck heel from an injury.
3,"Shipped Quickly, Very Good Value for Price Paid, Received in Great Condition, Would Recommend to My Family and Friends Anytime.","Shipped Quickly, Very Good Value for Price Paid, Received in Great Condition, Would Recommend to My Family and Friends Anytime. Did not improve my restfulness, however, it is worth a try since it may be more effective for others.."
3,Works only for back sleepers,"As a side sleeper, I cannot recommend this pillow. I should have paid attention to one of the reviewers who said it did not work for side sleepers. I agree with him/her."
5,awesome pillow,recommended by my chiropractor and is very comfortable. Machine washable also.My wife and I both use these pillows as well as my niece. Both my niece and I have fibromyalgia and find this to be helpful.
2,Too large for my husband.,"We really wanted this to work. I purchased this pillow for my husband and he is 6ft. This pillow is too large for him. He gave it a good try. But, now he wakes up with a horrible neck ache. The area that his neck rests on is too thick and large. This doesn't allow for his head to lie correctly in the ""resting area."" I would recommend the smaller pillow. This needs to be re-engineered."
2,Tri-Core pillow,Did not meet my expectations. Was hard to lay my head down and find a comfortable spot. Material was not as soft as I expected.
3,Deflates after a few months,"When I got this pillow, it was the most uncomfortable pillow I'd ever used.But, I'd read the reviews, and knew I had to break it in (or more accurately, acclimatize to sleeping on my back, and the angle of the pillow).After 3 weeks, it did its job, and I had way less headaches, and was sleeping better....but then after only 10 or so weeks more, the fluff inside squished down to being quite flat, and it no longer helped me to sleep, nor prevented my headaches.So if you have the money to buy LOTs of these, and just swap them out every few months, it could be great.But if not, I'd recommend a different pillow with this same shape, but one with more durable stuffing."
2,brand new tho not satisfied (yet),"Just received this. Was so excited after reading so many excellent reviews. Pillow seems too hard, too high and not comfortable. I am a side sleeper and it just feels uncomfortable plus gave me a headache I think-pushes at the base of my skull and bothers my ears as well when side lying. I am 5'2 very small framed so wonder if that is contributing to the issue. It seems well made, sturdy just am disapointed at the moment. Will need neck surgery (c3 c4)and have some back problems. Hope this doesnt make things worse. I will give it a week or so to see if I simply need to get used to it as others suggested. Don't want to judge too soon. Don't know abt Amazons return policy? Did not keep the box it came in. Glad it is working for many of you. I have never written a negative review so I am not just a nay sayer :-) Sleep tight all."
2,horrible,when i purchased this pillow i thought it was a orthopedic pillow it's nothing but an ordinary pillow which hurts when you use it. It doen't help anything i would definitly not recomend this to anyone!!!
3,OK PILLOW,"I PURCHASED THIS PILLOW A YEAR AGO AND USED IT FOR ONLY ONE NIGHT. IT HURT MY NECK. NOW I JUST USE IT IN THE LIVING ROOM AS BACK REST. THIS IS MUCH BETTER, VERY SOLID, BUT'M SORRY TO SAY THAT FOR THE NECK, IT'S NOT SO GOOD. FOR NOW MY KITTEN IS USING IT FOR NAP TIME. THAT'S COOL TOO.SCOTTY LIKES IT, SO I'M PLEASED WITH THIS PILLOW."
2,Good Watch But Poor Band,"The watch itself is fine. Nice looking and runs great. Unfortunately, the band is a piece of junk. It broke on me in less than a month. I sent it back to Invicta and they fixed it, but it took weeks to get back and I had to pay the shipping costs. About a year later the band came apart again. I fixed it that time, but it repeatedly came apart. The band also tarnished quite easily. I finally just took the band off and replaced it with a wide rubber one. I know this wasn't a super expensive watch, but I expected better quality materials from Invicta. Save your money and buy a nice Seiko."
2,"Useful at first, but not for long","We bought these books to teach us come finer aspects of Visual Test, and they do just that -- to an extent. Unfortunately, after the first several chapters, it quickly becomes useless, barely covering some very important aspects of the product (file I/O, pointers), and spending entirely too much time explaining how to test Wordpad. I would rather have a good reference for this product than this.It seemed a little half-baked. It was good in some areas, but for the most part lost usefulness quickly. I can't in good conscience give this any more than a mediocre review."
5,Samuel Menashe: Neglected no more!,Menashe is getting at last the recognition so long overdue. His poetry combines wit with precision in its lean spareness. I hope that many more will discover this master.Bruce M. Shipman

4,"Hooray for ""Halting""","This review is a collaborative writing project completed by the students in a ""Technology and Ethics"" class at DeVry University in beautiful Colorado Springs, Colorado. It is based on a quick look at the book under consideration.This book has several virtues. It provides a simple step-by-step process to keep hackers out. It also provides supportive links where you can download software to protect your hardware as well as business information. The simple wording allows you to concentrate on your work while helping you protect what you are working on.Although this book is outdated, it would still be helpful in setting up a security policy. The illustrations in this book would not be suitable for some business environments; however they would be useful for the individual computer user.I would recommend this book to beginners in the computer technology field. This book comes with a useful CD-ROM that contains software and added resources."
2,"In responce to the ""elite hacker""","Noticing the so called ""hackers"" word of disgust towards this book, I am left asking myself time and time again, was this book geared towards teaching the average joe to hack? Judging by it's content and brief description I thought not, instead it offers a somewhat quick, realistic view of how companies all across the net are being attacked, and in doing so it offers a somewhat indepth but easy to understand method of securing ones computer."
3,METAL?,"OK, I like this cd, it's a good cd. But it isn't ""metal"". I'm so sick of all these metalheads that happen across hardcore somewhere and think that because it has guitars in it, it's metal. You don't understand. It's not the music, it's the way it's played. Metallica, Megadeath, and other metal bands have nothing to do with hardcore. Hardcore is about the scene, about unity, and about change. Your average headbanger that goes to a metallica show knows nothing of these things. He just wants to get drunk and bang his head. Please stop comparing hardcore to that."
3,Fragmented yet touching,"The beginning of the book was wonderful. Vivid. I could hear the characters' every heartbeat. As the stories of Click and Fright unfolded, I yearned for some sort of resolution, or at least an epiphany.I was disappointed in the shift of narrative to the therapist, Sad. Though his story was compelling, I felt that the focus was drawn too far away from the children I'd met at the book's beginning. And his story was far less interesting and not as well written.All in all, I think there were too many missed connections in this book, but I still enjoyed reading it and would recommend it to those interested in this genre."

Again like in other books by Fred- easy language and easy steps to follow.He knows how to make money on selling your knowledge.If you know something- this is the product to sell.

2,Wrong picture??????,The book is fine but i was looking for a third refrence book to spellfire and just looked on the picture before i bought it.. (my bad i know) but this is the third thime amazon want me to write a review on this purchase..And this is not how the first spellfire refrence guide book look like..i allready own a couple of numer one and two
2,Bean Counters Win Again,"I had used this product for years, when suddenly all the local suppliers (Feed Stores, mostly) stopped carrying it. When I found it online, I noticed that the label had changed, but hoped that didn't signify a change in formula.I don't know what they've done to it, but the color of mixture is different (it was white and now is beige), the smell is different, and it doesn't work as well as it used to. Now I know why the stores stopped carrying it: farmers need products that work; they will not continue to use something out of ""brand loyalty"".I'm guessing that the bean-counters found a way to use cheaper ingredients and save themselves a penny a jar. Too bad - it used to be a good product."
3,Lots of Adirondack history but- - -,"I feel that Robin Obomsawin did a much better job with her previous books by adding alot more pictures of the insides of the homes she wrote about. I was sadly disappointed that there were not more pictures of Adirondack homes. I have been very happy with her other books because of the beautiful pictures taken on the interiors, but this book was lacking in pictures of just that- interiors. I really looked forward to this book being released and bought it ""sight unseen"" and was deeply let down that inside the book, it lacked more pictures of cozy cabin retreats, showcasing all the rooms and decorating where I get my inspirations and ideas from. The author was very clear and informative on the adirondack history though and the building materials used on these types of houses."
4,Good budget center speaker,"I received this center channel a few days ago, and so far,I like what I hear. I'm still breaking it in, but so far the dialogue sounds very loud,but a little muffled,however I think thats because of my audyssey settings and not the speaker. I'm pairing this with the Athena lS 300b floorstanding speakers.Athena LS-300B Floorstanding Speaker, Single (Black Ash)I'd say for $99.00 this is a good value. Great for those just entering the AV enthusiast fold."
3,"Cute Story for Young Children - a review of ""Bus Stop, Bus Go!""","It's big kids and a mischievous hamster that are at the center of this cute book that features bright artwork and a nice little rhyme.The story is easy enough for toddlers to follow, and interesting enough for preschoolers who will be kept hopping as they try to find Hammy as he scurries about the bus.Three Stars. Okay read-aloud. Fun concept and nice colorful artwork."
4,On the edge of your seat excitement!!,"Although this movie was very predictable when we first saw it at the Movie Theater, it was good enough to rent the second time. Now we're buying it, because it is one of very few movies that has held my interest through the entire movie. You know what's going to happen, and it still scares you into tomorrow!!!"
1,Not the original pilot film from 1975!!,"This is not the original pilot film which was titled: The New Original Wonder Woman in 1975. The version here is the re-edited 1976 cut, using footage from the 1975 film edited campy with light humour. While this is fine as a film it is not the way it was presented. Notable differences shown here in the DVD is the opening title credits that do not show the full title of the film in favour of the regular ABC TV series. certain camera angles and performance delivery differs as well. The major animated difference is that Wonder Woman deflected bullets in the true pilot film which was replaced with the lasso twirl.As for the DVD - it would be better to get the entire frist season collection rather than this single disc. I would have enjoyed this single disc if it were to have the true pilot of 1975 which has NEVER been released on DVD."
1,Don't buy this,"You would be paying $30 for $20 worth of Wii points. Just buy the normal $20 card, or purchase the same number of points with your credit card on the Wii shop channel."
1,Amazon = $30 upcharge,You can buy this directly through the shop channel on your Wii for $20. Why in the world would you pay an extra $34 to get it from Amazon???
3,Good filler item for those who were going to buy Wii points anyway...,"As long as Amazon keeps this under $20 (face value), and you were meaning to get some Wii points anyway, then this makes a perfect way for you to qualify for free super saver shipping. In addition, residents in most states do not need to worry about paying for tax, making the few pennies under Amazon's $19.99 price pennies earned."
1,joke,"I don't know why all of these Nintendo points cards are more than the value plus shipping. first of all, for a 2000 point card it is 20 dollars through the wii. second of all, why is shipping 7.99 for a gift card? anyone else think these prices are crazy."
5,Buy this card only if have free shipping,"If you are buying the Wii points card with a credit card, do it only if you have free shipping, and are buying directly from Amazon at the $19.82 sale price for saving $0.18. Else just buy the Wii points through the Wii Shop Channel, it's easy and you get the points immediately available for use.Do not buy it from sellers selling at past this price, except if you don't have a credit card and you are using some other method for paying. Then you have no other option.The Virtual Console is another genius stroke from Nintendo, having all those games available for downloading makes that nostalgia for the games we played as kids go away. Definitely recommend getting Wii Points for downloading these games. Also I recommend getting the Classic controller."
2,$16.12 Shipping charge if you order through Amazon,"Be careful. If you order this card through the link on the first page they charge you $16.12 shipping and handling to ship it from Target. If you go to the 'other buying options' button, it says $2.69 shipping from Target. I called customer service about the difference and was told that if you buy it through amazon then target, that is the shipping. Customer service did refund the extra shipping (Amazon has great customer service in my experience), but you should be aware of the problem."
4,Almost as good as they ever were....,"I've seen these guys live three times - 1984, 1986, and 1998. This DVD was almost as good as the real shows. The only missing element is Ian Gillian's voice - he can't hit those high notes anymore, and his lung power is very obviously fading. Despite all that, he has a rollicking good time, as does Steve Morse. The sound quality (DTS 5.1) cannot compare to the best I've heard (Eagles - Hell Freezes Over), but still, it's well engineered to suit Purple's genre of music - slightly muted highs and a great thumping bass line. ""Perfect Strangers"", ""Lazy"" and ""Space Truckin"" are the highlights. Also nice to hear an old favourite ""Mary Long"". But ""Woman From Tokyo"" was disappointing - the studio cut was better. The bass and drum solos on ""Speed King"" are simply out of this world - as good or better than the great Lord/Blackmore jam on ""Strange Kind Of Woman"" from the ""Made In Japan"" album.Overall, highly recommended and a must have for any true rock fan."
1,deep purple are the best ever!!,watching this dvd shows that even that the band has changed over the years it still rocks. it's not only the sound that makes you so happy and glad - it's allso the songs and the very tiet preformance. you cann't find anything like it... its siance... deep purple are the profesors of heavy rock ! nobody has ever replaced them. great!!!
3,Not a great performance from a great band!,"This dvd is not what any Deep Purple fan should call great. The band plays fairly well but Ian Gillan needs to contemplate retirement. His performance here pales in comparison to his earlier dominance of rock frontmen. It's obvious he realizes it as he appears uncomfortable while struggling to hit his mark throughout the concert. Perhaps the boys should look for a younger frontman who has the pipes to lead this band. Steve Morse does ok replacing Blackmore but just ok. One bright star is John Lord who, to my knowledge, has since retired...too bad because he can still do his part. Overall sound is pretty good but video is weak by today's standards."
1,A better writer than Sadler but not a better storyteller,"This book was a terrible dissapointment. The author is a skilled writer and has a greater grasp of the English language than Sadler ever did but what he doesn't have is the storytellers gift. This book was dull and uninspired, far too much time was spent describing unimportant details or simply spending page after page describing Casca eating and getting fat or someother sedentary activity. Sadler's books moved with a dynamic energy, never seeming to dally on a point but always rushing forward too some new instance of action or excitment. This book completely lacked that thrill."
5,The best movie about a skateboarding pup ever!,"Pochacco is the cutest! He lives in a rad house with a glass roof, rides a skateboard all around while holding a balloon, has a best friend who is a very clever and loyal mouse, and goes to bat for anyone who needs help! A must see!"
4,Good Viewing in a Small Package,"Bushnell is a company long known for making great optics in the sporting arena. The 8-20x 25mm Porro Prism Binoculars offer a fine example of good quality for a good price. In today's mobile world many of the items we once only knew in ""large"" sizes have shrunk to much more practical sizes. These binoculars are an excellent example. They provide easy and swift focus of each eyepiece. The added benefit of variable power makes these binoculars a treat. They have fine light collecting capability, a decent field of view and a sturdy housing that takes abuse. The only glitch is that the variable power lever does not move quite as smoothly as it could. All in all, I am extremely pleased."
1,"5 minutes 3-d, 70 minutes of dreck","The 3-d dream/altered states episodes of this movie are great---but they add up to somewhere over five minutes!The whole movie is only about 75 minutes----with the non-3d movie scenes totally worthless. The cast is a bunch of nobodies, there are maybe 12 characters during most of the movie, and another 12 for the end. The direction is amateurish, with characters standing around while the camera moves! The script seems to have been made up as they went along, since one scene definately doesn't lead to the other. And the whole thing is cheap, and looks it. Hammer and AIP movies from the 1960s look better, have a better cast, and better script.This 1961 movie is as forgotten as any movie from 1931, because the five minutes of 3-d is the only good thing.This movie was made in canada, if that also matters any."
3,The Mask,"i first saw this film on tv when i was about 7 years old, and i remember it as being the first movie that ever scared me.the plot is pretty simple: psychiatrist fools around with an ancient sacred indian mask that eventually drives him to insanity.im now 23, and after having recently viewed the film again, its really not scary, more like just eerie.the ""nightmare"" scenes filmed in 3-d (about 15 minutes of the total running time) are truly quite chilling, and the movie itself really isnt that bad. the music is also pretty creepy and does a good job at setting the tone for the film, but the acting and dialogue do leave something to be desired. but come on, what can you expect from an early 60s B movie.anyway, break out the popcorn, turn off the lights, and ""put the mask on, now."""
4,"Very, very nice","Pros:- Field backup of your photos- Nice display- Easy to understand and use (compared to, say, your camera)Cons which, if corrected, would put it in the 5 star:- Slow to load from CF to internal HDD- No external battery charger- Cannot zoom in on camera RAW files- Price $200 less (might as well dream)4 stars. Worth owning."
5,Great songs to inspire dance!,"If you are looking for traditional songs with a gypsy flare, this is what you have been looking for! Many songs are a 9/8's rythm. There is a nice mix of fast and slow songs-all very dramatic. These songs have the ability to stir the spirit within. I dare you to try and suppress the urge to dance!"
4,Another Great Activision Product!,"I was worried that this game might be buggy like Dominion Wars, but I was really surprised. Activision made Elite Force last year, and I was hoping this would be that good too. The graphics are really great, and once you get the shortcut keys down the game plays pretty well too. A must buy if you're a Trek fan, and if you liked Dominion War and Armada, you'll love this game!"
4,Pretty Good so far...,"I just bought this game and it is really great. I was expecting it to be good since it was made by Totally Games, the company that made a lot of those great Star Wars games. What was really a pleasent surprise was how quickly I was able to learn the user interface. Using the mouse, you interact with the bridge crew: just point to a station and click the mouse. There are 4 Federation ship types that you can command: Sovereign, Akula, Galaxy and another near-Galaxy class sized ship.Just like in Klingon Academy, there is a skirmish mode where you can design your own battles. The only negative is that there is no joystick support that I can determine. The graphics and cutscenes are great."
3,Observing,"My brother and I got this yesterday. I thought it was fun for the first hour before it got boring. As star trek fans we downloaded the demo and liked it. Than we got the real thingfive days later. Here are the things about it:PRO:Excelant graphicsVery interesting storyfun combatwide varriaty of ships, weapons, and theatresCONS:horrible dubbingbad saving systemfirst officer is a snichtvery scriptedyou fail the mission if you don't follow the scriptyour first officer bosses you aroundyour first officer makes diccisions for youyou're like a observer, not a captainyou don't pick your own ships/peoplevery little stratagy"
1,"Scary themes, no resolution","I made the mistake of reading this for the first time with my 4 year old daughter and 3 year old son. I am a believer in letting children learn lessons of life and don't try to shield them from illness and death...however, this book deals with both, and neither in a remotely appropriate manner. The narrator's best friend dies suddenly while she is herself suffering from cancer. As I read along, I expected there to be some resolution ...none came. We don't know if the child recovers. This is definitely not a book I would recommend, even as one trying to explain death or serious illness to a child. The issues were not at all gently presented. Definitely worth a miss!"
2,disappointing - nowhere near as well done as previous novels,"To my mind, this is yet another example of the sad fact that successful authors rarely get better as they get older. She starts with a good idea, which is to set the story in England during WWII, concentrating on a group of women working with barrage balloons, which is interesting to read about. Unfortunately the character development and plot are nothing special. There are four main characters, each with careers and love-lives to follow over the 4 or so years covered, and the story progresses very fast to cover all this material, without ever really drawing the reader in, apart from the beginning of the book which focuses on their boot camp training.My summary - don't bother."
1,terrible delivery time,"I paid so much extra for next day delivery because I was leaving for vacation in two days and wanted to bring the dvd with me. I ordered on a Thursday, but it was not even shipped out until the following Wednesday, SIX days later. Yet somehow I was still charged for next day delivery. I will never ever use this seller again!!"
2,Early Karajan,"This is a collection to pass. Poor sound in many spots and lethargic performances in most cases.The bon-bons are dreadful and flat. The Espana has no sparkle. Compared with Beecham or Ormandy...well..there just is no comparison.Pictures at an Exhibition is plain dull. Try Toscanini for this work.The Walton and Sibelius symphonies are the best selections in the set. However, there are many better performances available.Only hard core Karajan fans should consider buying this set."
2,These are terrible and completely overpriced.,I have Shure e2c in ears and this is most definitely not the same foam that comes with them. I used the medium in the foam that came with my e2c headphones and the medium in these doesn't fit right and falls out.
4,Fit for purpose but overpriced,The foam does a good job of forming to the ear canal enabling the phone earpiece to remain in place and at the same time provide external sound insulation. It is difficult to see the justification for the price of the foam though.
1,They don't fit E2C!!,"The interior plastic shafts in these replacement foams DO NOT FIT the Shure E2Cs tightly enough to work properly. They slip off of the earbud spindle easily, and thus DO NOT offer the same tight fit as the original. Given the huge markup for a piece of plastic and some foam, this is incredibly irritating. If you enjoy earbud-less foam stuck in your ear, this is the product for you."
4,Doom Metal,"Roads is terrific. It is so rare to find a doom metal band that combines exquisitely beautiful symphonic type sound with mega heavy beat. In this, My Dying Bride is unequaled! I like this band so much I have all their works. Gave a 4 star because had at least 4 good songs I liked. Look forward to next release."
1,Really disappointed,"I haven't played a lot of video games, but I did play God Of War before starting this one. What a huge let down. Way lousier graphics, character controllability, story line, and endless ""loading"" delays. Bleccchhh!"
4,GTA San Andreas,"It was one of my PS2 favorite games, a couple years ago. I will not loose the game again. Even is old is really good, excellent story game, missions, and games features, my advice use it with the strategy guide you will take your game further."
2,"What happened to ""German Craftsmanship""?","I have a Rowenta Iron that looks identical to the iron that arrived. My old Iron looks new and still free of external blemishes. We took the new iron (for which I paid Sat. delivery fees) out of the box and immediately found scratches and a crack on the housing. We wanted the iron replaced but found we can only get a refund. My wife's family is from Germany and were sad to read reviews of manufacturing defects. Long story short, I now have to go out to a brick and mortar store the find an iron today, because we need one! I'm a long-time and loyal Amazon customer, but this really upsets me that this is necessary."
5,"Perfect iron, if treated properly","This iron is the only one I'll use---my opinion hasn't changed in >15 years of dressmaking. As for the leaking, yes, it'll leak if you don't feed it the right water. The troubleshooting guide warns you of this and they aren't messing around. You can't use 100% distilled water with these irons. If you do, they leak. They're meant to be used with tap water, 50/50 tap and distilled or spring water. It'll also spew out brown water if your tap water is too hard, like mine is (the troubleshooting guide tells you about this, too). I switched to filtered tap water from the fridge and haven't had a problem since. That was years ago. If this is too much a hassle for you, you probably won't like this iron. For me, it's not that big of a deal. My Rowenta is worth it."
3,"Interesting, but short","I had relatively high expectations of this video, after reading about the role its creators played in the events on Everest discussed in the books about the tragedy; the video was interesting but much shorter than I'd imagined. It includes an interview with survivor Buck Weathers (hope I remembered the name right) which is very interesting. It's worth watching, but perhaps better as a rental."
2,Disappointing,"I was in Nepal in 1996, the year of the disaster on Everest. I met David Brashears and Aracelli Segarra. They are impressive people and what they did in the service of the hapless climbers (putting their expedition on hold to help the rescue efforts, lending their oxygen tanks, etc.) should all by itself have made an incredible story. Beck Weathers' incredible against-all-odds survival and the heroism of the Nepali Air Force chopper pilot who rescued him are in the movie but could have figured larger. In fact, there was so much more that could have been done with this movie that it was almost anticlimactic to watch. Very disappointing, considering the subject. Also, the visuals were by-and-large not as impressive as previous IMAX movies I have seen. If you want to experience a real nail-biting version of the Everest disaster of 1996 you must read Jon Krakauer's excellent and definitive book ""Into Thin Air."" So far, nothing exceeds it."
1,"Mediocre, at best!","I have read ""Into Thin Air"" and watched the Discovery Channel series on Mt. Everest, so I received this DVD with great anticipation. However, my excitement dissolved quickly due to the cheesy music, awful special effects, lack of drama, and poor landscape visuals. I was completely bored. It was a waste of 45 minutes."
3,Not that Great but it'll do.,"Hmmm... how should i say this. If you dont want to spoil this film. then dont read Into Thin Air by Krakauer. That was my mistake. I read the book first before I saw this. The book is much much much better than this film although this film was not about this book. However, the producers tied this film to the 1996 Everest expedition disaster which what Krakauer's book is all about. Also, dont be misled about seeing the actual rescue in this film because there isn't any. All you see are snapshots of the rescue. The movie is more about how it feels to climb everest. But somehow the producers is selling it on the idea of the everest disaster. My take on this film is don't be too excited about it. I would rather recommend Nova's Everest DVD."
3,Shortened by the 1996 Disaster,The reason for three stars instead of five is because this DVD is only about 45 minutes in length. I wanted more. There is the possibility that it was cut short in order to assist in saving lives on Mt. Everest during the 1996 Disaster. If I knew that to be the case I would change my rating to 5 stars with no regrets. I would liked to have seen more filming at the different camps along the way to the summit. Excellent filming but way too short in length and information.
1,Trash,"Having read ""Not Simply Divine"" - the original book on Divine's story, I feel that this book is just trying to deny the real truth behind the star we all loved. I wanted to find out something new and exciting about my hero, but this book just went on about nothing at all and was most dissapointing in every respect of the word. A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME !!!"
4,Divine's Family,"A good book to read as it shows another side of Divine that only his family would know. Its more of an upbeat book than one might imagine, and a great read for insight on the person, not the actor."
2,5 stars but for the atrocious editing,I have owned the full series for a number of years in paperback and it is one of those I reread almost yearly because of the quality of writing and story. However the publishers of the Kindle edition have not bothered to proofread properly. Names are mixed up and the spelling is atrocious. This really needs to be updated. This goes for the full series. If you want to read this go for the paperback for now until this is fixed.
4,Good but definitely not magic...,"This book is a solid purchase and I would recommend it for any real hacker (as I was before I bought this boook). The tips they give are excellent for lowering your score. That said, you won't really FEEL or even LOOK like a better golfer after reading this book. You'll just be scoring lower.I have probably played 10 rounds since I've read the book and I've gone from not even keeping track of my score to consistently shooting right around 100. The tips in this book have kept me from hitting so many unplayable tee shots and from shanking so many of my shots within 100 yards. as a result, I have shaved a significant number of strokes from my score. I still look like a hacker to my friends, the only differnce is my score is much closer to a respectable score.Don't expect this book to teach how to hit better looking shots or how to get rid of your slice. This book is only good for exactly what the title says it is good for... getting you under 100 quickly. That's it."
2,finally received,"the product itself if exactly what I wanted and was looking for, difficult to locate in the stores near my home.the problem was that I ordered in before Thanksgiving and it arrived finally today (12/29/10) AFTER a month and several days... although it was scheduled to arrive between Dec 2 and 7....Glad it finally came though."
1,Great Item (if you get what you order)- Poor Customer Service,"I've used the Oral B Ultra Floss for years, but have noticed it's not being stocked in the stores where I live. I found this item on Amazon and thought it was a good deal and I could stock up on it (takes a while to go through 6 packs of dental floss). When I placed the order I hadn't read the reviews. Hindsight being 20/20 I should have. Not only did I receive only a singleton the first time, but the replacement sent by Amazon was a singleton as well. After contacting customer service (via email, since I couldn't find a number to talk to a real person) all I got was that this problem was larger than they thought (I'll say) and that I need to return the item for a refund. Negative well done on Amazon's part for not correcting this problem when it first surfaced (which based on the previous reviews was some time ago). Things happen but this was a matter of poor performance on Amazon's part."
5,Works - that's all,"Well, with this product, you will feel no hunger. Futher, there is no feeling of being ""spaced out"" or being high. Of course, you could still eat poor quality food and gain weight, that part is up to you. But if you are willing to cut down, this will be a big help to you."
5,Here Comes The Sun cd,"The Cd came as described quickly and it is a terrific acoustic - easy listening music compilation for people looking for some relaxing ,quiet versions of some great old classics. I wish they were available cheaper for Canadian buyers but I gotta tell ya I will probably order the rest of the series anyway. Benedetti and Pupping did a nice job with these oldies. Buy them all at once and save some shipping costs because you won't be disappointed."
5,"If I could rate it 11, I would","Everytime you open a book by Patricia Highsmith, there is no certainty at all about what you will encounter (at least that happens to me). However, this time I found more surprises than usual. Each of the 11 stories has its particular charm, but the one I loved most was ""Blow It"". It is worth buying the book just to read this story. If you are a woman and you like Highsmith, you cannot afford to leave this one unread. And, remember, reality is more frightening than horror movies!"
5,Guitar-charged Raspberries!!!!!!....finally sounding right.,"This is the most rocking Raspberries album. All of the best guitar solos are on this album....the guitars in general sound GREAT. From 'Tonight' to 'Hard to Get Over a Heartbreak' to 'Ecstasy' to 'I'm A Rocker'..if you don't know all these tunes, you need this import version of Side 3. These latest reissues are in beautiful digipaks and the sound is awesome. If you've only had their greatest hits over the years, it's time to get these 4 Cd's."
4,Almost Perfect,"I've had the large 10 pocket Bosca before, and that was great, but it was always too big for some pockets, so this time, I got the smaller 8 pocket. This wallet is so superior to the average wallet--the leather, the craftsmanship, and the size in the ""width"" dimension is perfect. It allows for multiple cards in the same slots, without struggling to get them in and out.The reason I say ""almost perfect"" is the ""height"". I wish the wallet were about 1/4 to 1/2 inch taller so that currency would easily go well into the wallet. Right now, it's OK, but a close fit, and if you have a lot of other things, like receipts in there, you have to manipulate a bit.But, overall, it is a great wallet."
3,"Ordered this 12-pack, but got only one","I ordered this 12-pack (600 meters total of dental floss), but received only one package (50 meters). When I ordered, I read a customer comment that said this might be a problem. That customer was right. It's a bit of a hassle to return and replace such a small item. That old customer comment is no longer available, but the underlying problem with ordering 12-packs of floss seems to have been going on for quite some time."
3,Not For Beginners,"If I were to recommend a book on Gnosticism to someone who knows little or nothing on the subject but would like an overview, this would NOT be the book I would recommend. That's not to say this book wasn't without it's merits but it's a little overly complicated and narrow in it's scope of understanding. It also was a little boring in parts and I found myself having to ""push through"" to the end.I did gain a clearer understanding of ancient Gnosticism compaired with more modern Gnostic beliefs presented by authors such as Samael Aun Weor. This book was also very unique in that it dealt with a lot of the ancient symbology around Gnosticism which is something I've never seen before.If you already have a basic understanding of Gnosticism and you're looking to expand your knowledge this book might be for you, If you want information about ancient Gnostic symbols this book is for you, If you want an introduction to Gnosticism I say look elsewhere."
5,Cute and sweet,My 4 year old just learned how to bake cup cakes and always used my mittens. Now she has her own set and we are both in action in the kitchen.
2,brief to the point of being useless,I just finished this book the whole time wondering what I was missing since I didn't understand anything. Then I started Pro Spring by Rob Harrop. Pro Spring is so much better it's like night and day. Also there were too many errors and mistakes in A Developer's Notebook. I can't recommend this book since it's not even useful as a reference.
2,Get another Spring book,"This is NOT like the other excellent books by Tate and Gehtland.The foreward of the book promises to teach by example, but in the first chapter you discover that the examples are broken. After half a day just trying to get ""example 1-4"" working in Eclipse, I'm throwing in the towel.I hope ""Spring in Action"" had a better quality check than this""notebook""."
5,Been using them for years,"Best toothbrush ever and believe me I've tried a lot. Leaves ur teeth and mouth feeling extra clean, I've been using with crest 3d white"
1,I still don't know if it's gonna work,"It's a very basic unit. From the manual, it needs to be charged for 8 hours for 7 Three-minute uses. When I put it onto the charger, the light is not on as described in the maual. I have no idea if it is charging or not. Have to wait a couple hours to see."
3,A little flat,"Empire Earth is a very good game. This expansion does have a few extras in it that make it fun, but their main selling point, the space aspects, leave a lot to be desired.Basically, the space units are sea units, and the ""planets"" are nothing but small islands. The units: carriers, transports, and battleships, are simply redesigned naval vessels. Also, if there was such a thing in real life as the space units, they would be able to traverse the entire planet and attack anything. In EE:AOC, they can only attack the outside fringe of the planets, and not anything on the face of the planet itself.Overall, this might be a good add-on for some people, myself included, but the hype over the space units and epoch is unwarranted. If you're a die-hard EE fan, then this is a good buy. If not, reconsider, unless you want to play someone else who has the expansion."
5,So Much Better Than My Old Hairdyer,This dries my hair so much faster and the cold shot button does not need to be held down to work. It was well worth the money.
5,Love this dryer!,This is my 2nd chi rocket. I had the first one for 3+ years and only had to replace it because someone stepped on it and it broke. I absolutely LOVE this blow dryer!!!!! Makes my hair smooth and shiny and leaves no tangles when drying.
3,Not what I expected,"I'm a hairdresser and I had this blowdryer for a lil over a year and I loved it. It was always real hot, quiet, light weight. Then it dies on me but I loved it so much I decided to get another one this time off amazon instead of thehair store. I guess they redesigned it or something because after 2 wks of having it got really loud the cool shock would come on every 5 seconds like w the old red chi blowdryer(the reason I stopped using that one as well). And it doesn't get as hot as the old rocket I had. I don't know whether it's chi fault and I got their crappy mistake or if it was amzons fault but either way a month after I bought it I had to go by a new blowdryer that worked faster."
5,Great Hair Dryer,"My daughter came home with this same model hair dryer and I used it all summer. As soon as she went back to school she took it with her. I found my old hair dryer didn't do it anymore and needed to puchase one like hers. I priced them at several local salons and found Amazon had the best price. I can't say enough good things about this product since it works so well. Let's just say ""you get what you pay for"" the expense was well worth it. I would highly recommend purchasing this product with out a doubt."
2,Worked fine until today!,"I spent a bit more on a hair dryer 2 1/2 years ago when I needed to replace a cheap brand that had worked for 7 years. I thought I would spend a little more on a nicer one and see how it would do. I had been previously very happy with this purchase until this morning. While using it on the low setting as I do every single day, suddenly it changed itself to high (during use mind you), and low would no longer work. This means that on the low setting, it blows high as it does on the high setting also. I never use high. I called their customer service and since it's no longer under warranty, I'm just out of luck. So this expensive hair dryer becomes a disposable piece of garbage after 2 1/2 years. I'm extremely disappointed, and my next purchase will NOT be a CHI brand because of this experience."
4,Nice Hair Dryer,"I got this as a gift for my wife for Christmas 2008. They were sold out in real world stores when I went out looking for them. Luckily, I was able to not only find it on Amazon, but for less then I would have paid otherwise -- and it came on time. This replaced a $15 pharmacy bought hair dryer and is a vast improvement. My wife loves the thing. Being as manly as I am, I don't use a hair dryer; however, I can attest to its quietness (my wife gets up for work before me and it does not wake me up like her previous ones used to). I would recommend it to a friend. Don't be disheartened by the four stars I gave it -- I typically don't hand out five stars."
4,CHI Dryer,Brought this dryer for my daughter for Christmas but it is now in my dressing room because it dries so quickly and I plan to buy another one :)
5,"Blood Beats: Vol.1 Demos, Remixes & Extended Versions","Hardy's Bloodbeats breaks and shimmies with vernacular dexterity and spirit. It is a class-act testament to the post-post-modernist era that we live in. Hardy is not afraid of edges, interstices, places where dark and light meet to tell a story of becoming; he moves as an essayist/writer with near-shaman ability to transform life amid pop-culture icons, underground dreads, queer and all other counter publics into something with irresistible shine. The collection of interviews and articles is culture and subculture for the adventurous or the main. It's wildly fresh writing!"
4,overall worth the money,"Peter Pupping is a skilled guitarist who's warm Christmas CD is enchanting to experience. However, two tracks contain vocals and the singer seems to have little professional skill with her voice. It's not awful, but neither is it terribly pleasing to hear bursting forth from your sound system. That is the only reason I am giving this otherwise beautiful collection only four stars. Other than that this CD is very worth the money and I am glad to have purchased it."
5,It's just like cliffnotes on life..but far more interesting!,I am so thankful that Julia Borland wrote this book!Every girl in her twentis should read this. It has helped me in my life imenesly. She gave me a wonderful heads up for what is to come during this transition from a young woman to a fully grown woman. I appriciate her honestly and her caring heart. She should be on a stamp!
4,Entertaining and edifying,"This was a well-researched, informative and entertaining read. The author's point may not be a new one, but he has done a fresh and original take on it, and we can't say it often enough: that the oppression of human beings in the name of God is a horror and an abomination, and it never seems to stop. The fact that Yanow's characters are lively, and the style so accessible, will hopefully encourage people who aren't keen on history to read it and think. The one thing that bothered me somewhat was the anachronistic dialogue (Guidotti and other characters sometimes sounded like Mafia goons), but perhaps that's the price you pay when you're trying to appeal to a big cross-section. Overall, a terrific book."
3,How ruin a great francise,I enjoyed the first season until the last episode. What is it with following the 'GOD' signal through the Universe? I thought this series was about seeing the 'GODS' as false and that the ancients were the ones really go all this 'GOD' work. I can see why this series was canceled. Maybe sense they set the stage for this to be revisited in 2014. I can see where they talk able the each part of the journey being needed before the next step is taken. This is a very Buddhist approach to a journey. I hope the movie where they re-visit this in 2014 improves the story line.
4,A group of love stories dealing with the fantastic,"I just finished reading the 1907 first edition of this book. There are some very good ideas here and the prose to back them up but the sugery romance themes that dominated Chambers' later career are starting to show a little too much here for my taste.The Carpet of Belshazzar, the piece that binds together all of the other stories, is dark and brilliant.The Golden Pool is great and touching, a good piece of prose.The Tree of Dreams and The Swastika are light and funny, if anything dealing with a swastika can be said to be funny after 1938. Try to remember that this was written in 1907.The Sign of Venus is just plane funMost of the rest are okay to better than okay.Larry LocFor more info on Chambers see www.ioc.net/~larryloc/yking001.html"
1,Rebate offer,"As a previous review has noted, the rebate never shows up; after 7 months in my case. I would like to offer up something good about this keyboard, but it irks me after filling out the rebate offer and sending it off, to never hear from them again. Also, they keep saying that the NT driver for this keyboard is ""coming soon"". I guess that means after a couple of years for them. As it stands now, if you don't use this keyboard with Windows 98, then all of the features are useless."
1,AVOID THIS PRODUCT!,"We bought the 2001 version. It fails to load or run on two separate Win98SE systems. Encyclopedia Of Science *hangs* one system requiring a push-button reboot, and complains of ""insufficient memory or disk space"" (I have 256 MB/40GB respectively) on the other.DiabloII (Classic & LOD) and MechWarrior II, IV, and Black Knight both run on both machines, so do IE6, Reader Rabbit, Knowledge Adventure, Print Master, Forte Agent, and many others.Editorial reviews put this as better than the 2002 version. Unbelievable."
1,don't like it,"It doesn't work for me. I thought it might be close to the toothbrush they used to make, but it is not. It seems to just rub back and forth and not brush. What ever happened to just a plain toothbrush? One with a plain handle and 60 bundles of plain bristles. Bring that one back."
4,"Couldnt wait for the 2nd album,",I loved their first disc and this one follows right along with it. Nice follow up album.
4,Good sophmore album...,I've been following Eisbrecher for a while now and their a great band. Their trip rock is outstandin!!! Their new album Antikorper follows in the foot steps of their first one. Very good electronica with hard riffs. Good stuff!!! The only difference was that their music got alot harder. At first i was dissapointed and thought they sounded alot more like Rammstein...Which is not bad but still..Eisbrecher always sounded alot different. But as i listend to it more and more it seperated itself and was truly a good album...If you like a good electronic rock album with good singing ....get this album and their first...
4,Very good,"Eisbrecher's album Antikörper reminds me a lot of Rammstein. They're perhaps slightly (just barely) lighter than Rammstein though. The singing is very similar. Eisbrecher uses more keyboards. It sounds very modern. Overall, the album is good and plenty of fun."
5,"Haunting, beautiful, & peaceful","Gabriel Faure is hardly among the best known classical composers in the world, but this album makes a strong argument as to why he should be. John Rutter & the Cambridge singers never disappoint, and Faure's ""Cantique de Jean Racine"" and ""Requiem"" are magnificent, haunting, & peaceful. A must have for any lover of choral music or anyone just ""browsing"", looking for something different."
1,Not washable!,That is it's bad point. My son is a spitter upper - especially when you put him on his tummy. You can only spot clean this - can't go in the wash. Looking back - I would say you can save your money - just put a blanket or quilt on the floor and fun toys around your baby. They will be just as entertained and you will be $40 richer!
4,Impressive quality - Not too easy to setup though,"The product quality of this item is unbeatable. It is sturdy and offers tremendous room. The actual useful room is significant because the walls go almost straight up so you can stand near the edge of the tent so the amount of internal space is great. The only problem was setup. You have to follow the directions carefully, even then, the setup is not too easy. I feel like there is lots of pressure on the poles as you lift the tent in a circular, add one leg at a time manner. The height is also challenging but that's what you are after so I don't complain about that. This is a 5 star tent even with the difficulty of the setup except for what I consider excessive pressure on the poles during setup."
1,"83 minutes, 82 are boring","Everything about this movie is small: barely an hour long (shorter than a Disney film), barely any story (one Mountie cleans up some little settlement), no fun factor (slow action even where there's any action), small cast etc... It does a good job of portraying the harsh realities of the period and the region (Yukon territory, the only thing that's not small in this movie), but unless you're a die hard western fan (or a Canadian history buff) I would pass without looking twice."
1,fragile,"Bought this for my 14 yr old son. He dropped it on carpet last weekend with the telephoto lens out (taking video) and that was it. It may be inexpensive to buy, but it sure wasn't inexpensive to fix (warranty doesn't cover it). We were hoping for a little more than 4 months use. I am afraid of the lens problem Canon seems to have, but it took really nice pics and was easy for a kid (and non-digital parent) to use. Wish Canon wouldn't use cheapo plastic on otherwise great camera."
5,Simple and Kind!,This book blesses not only your heart but your mind as well! It is simple and kind...aging isn't always that but in this book Chizea shows us how to treat ourselves with respect and gentleness as we face aging. She offers good logical advice as well as TLC for ourselves...something we all neglect to do. I definitely don't want to be without this book as I enjoy reading and re-reading the small nuggets of gold that I find tucked into the pages.
4,Oracle and Java for building Internet Applications,"This book appears to be more about getting the best from Java and Oracle, two industry strength platforms, when developing internet style applications.I found the many code examples useful, which helped to get some tasks completed. It is good to see a book that covers some breadth and more depth on using Java with an Oracle database. I liked the information on using Oracle SQL Objects and the brief introduction to Oracle Business Components for Java.The book could have had a more consistent flow, but this did not detract from what I needed to know. As everyone knows ""you cannot judge a book by its cover"", but perhaps the authors original title ""Oracle for Java Programmers"" (as stated in the introduction and overview) should have been retained."
2,Disappointed,"It is clear that a lot of work went into this book, however, inspite of the large number of pages in the book, it is not very useful. Maybe about 10% of the book has some good tips but the rest is simply out of Oracle education courses. I wish the authors had given some real-world example instead of showing some simple techniques that are fun to know but not really useful on a daily basis."
2,BORING!!!!!,"I can't tell you what a fan I am of prince but, what is going on with his music. It's just another disappointment in a recent string of disappointments! Where's the raw funk and the sexuality that I came to love. Come on Prince, no more of this boring garbage. A slow ballad filled with more etheral crap. Then we hear angry Prince on the flip side. Give me a break. What has happened to Prince!!!!!"
1,This band is really awful,"this is a boring band, is a cheap copy of a lot of heavy metal bands if you can consider this band a heavy metal band, i prefer to listen backstreetboys or nsync, i recomended to do other things like sale hot dogs or burguers in a corner. I knew this guys in Mexicali and they dont have a clue of what the heavy metal is, even what the music is, please, please, dont buy their album, if you want to have it, go to tepito and you have it if you buy a can of diet coke, no, of shasta."
3,"Good showerhead, terrible hose!","As soon as we tried to tighten the hose on, it broke. I did not try to exchange it since a relative took care of it and bought a replacement before coming to me, so I don't know if the company would have replaced it, but I also thought, what would have been the point since that one would have likely broke as well.The shower spray is not as strong as I hoped, but we have gotten used to it, its not that bad."
5,LOVE THIS PRODUCT!,"As someone who rarely pampers herself except for luxuriating in a long hot shower, this product is worth the money!It hooked up easily and hasn't leaked over the many months I've had it. I'm just now changing the filter inside. When I became educated on how dangerous hot showers are because you're breathing in the steam that contains all the chemicals in your water (I have city water) I realized that the cough that I experienced when showering was due to that fact and it concerned me a great deal. For the last 4 years since I lived in my current community I've coughed during my showers and felt throat irritation. Since installing this shower head I've no longer experienced the coughing or throat irritation and I immediately noticed the difference."
5,Long time Pansy Division Fan,"I've been in love with this band for about 13 years now. I only wish I had them when I was a teenager. Their music is bright, fun, it's everything a gay kid needs.Now, to upset Amazon, I'd order this from their web site so they'll get the most $$$. That is if it's working, it's down today. Goggle 'em and give it a shot."
1,Best Price Mirror: Honda Civic headlight - driver's side,"""Best Price Mirror"" = HORRIBLE! I purchased the headlight, and it arrived a week later than expected. Upon opening the package TWO of mounting tabs were broke due to poor packaging. I called the company's ""customer service"" number multiple times a day for 3 days and did not get to speak to anyone. I sent an email to their ""customer service"" and did not get a reply until 2 weeks later - at which time they asked if I would like a replacement sent? I answered yes, and that was 1 month ago...no response, no confirmation, no headlight. Best Price Mirror = BAD BUSINESS practices!"
3,"Good information, pretty bad writing","I happen to agree with most of the 5 star reviews, as well as the 2 star reviews - both viewpoints are accurate. This book contains some great information and is certainly helpful when trying to improve one's archery skill. However, it really isn't written very well and is difficult to get through cover to cover. If you remove the name dropping, infomercials of his products and services, and self-aggrandizing, it would be a much more useful (and shorter) book. I still think it's worth the patience of getting through it, but I wouldn't call it a fun read."
5,Humorous and on target!,Bernie Pellerite is right on target with his no nonsense and humorous approach to archery. It's easy to read and captivating at the same time. Highly recommended!
1,mostly melody with tablature,"Although this book has 110 songs for every level of playing and every genre of music, I found it mostly depict melody and not enough accompanying styles noted with the melody. If I want to play mostly melody on guitar, I'd rather buy ""the ultimate fake book with over 1200 songs"" because that's what it offers: melody, lyrics AND guitar chords. I was disappointed by the lack of accompanying examples on this book and lack of organization. The very end section should be in the front of the book,explaining the ""pick patterns"" and various technical things which are essential to learning guitar. I do not recommend this book to beginners."
2,Not such a great book,"This book makes no attempt to introduce anybody (even with a good technical and scientific background) to show the principles of loudspeaker design. The author makes a show of knowing the principles of design and evaluation, but the job of puting them in print is , at best, sloppy. Most of the formulae have bugs, thus making this a poor choice as a refernce book. As a summary, it is not a GOOD book on loudspeaker design. It is even, in absolute terms, and comparing with other disciplines, a very poor book on design. It has some interesting remarks, though.If you are looking on building a good understanding about the principles and methods guiding today's loudspeaker designs, forget about this book as a guide (not that I know of any better alternatives, though)."
4,Really nice wallet,"I bought this wallet for my boyfriend. He really likes the thin wallets, not bi-folds. The only thing I wish it had is a window for ID, but since it's so small it's understandable that there isn't one. The leather is really nice and looks pretty classy."
3,quantity misleading,"These are awesome toothbrushes. However, they are very expensive. The box contained only 6 toothbrushes. I thought there would be 35. Apparently the number ""35"" is the model number, not the quantity. Nowhere in the description was the actual quantity (six) actually listed. If I had known I was paying $30 for only 6 toothbrushes, I would not have ordered them."
4,An odd conglomeration,"Some live tracks and some remixes join on this unusual package. The ""Desert Rose"" edit is worth the price, but the exact purpose of this CD is oblique."
2,Captavatingly sick,"Ya' like seeing chopped body parts;women's tongues being ripped out of their heads;a guy being killed by Chinese watertorture;breasts, and sadistic maiming and mutilation ??? Then Boy-Howdy do we have the film for you!This movie attempts to present itself as a historically accurate docu-drama ( guffaw-guffaw), but it's nothing more than a gore-fest.Lay off the guacamole and chips before viewing this one."
1,Not worth the money,"This was just a particularly nasty Hammer horror-style of film with a lot of unpleasant torture scenes and some crappy acting to boot. It's really not worth wasting your money on, but it does at least have Herbert Lom in a post-Pink Panther role in what must surely be the film he wants to forget more than any other!"
2,Clumsy,"The authors acknowledge ""the vagaries of translation,"" then fall victim to them. Overwordy, inconsistent and sometimes just plain sloppy. Translates _ren_ as ""authoritative,"" which is about the most misleading choice I've ever seen. The notes and discussion, however, are quite good, and the original Chinese text is included. Pinyin romanization."
5,Rich translation with origninal text,"This particular translation of the Analects is wonderful. The author begins the book by introducing some terms that are difficult to translate or have multiple implications. In the text itself, these words are frequently left untranslated so that the reader can fully appreciate the diversity of the meaning. The english text is presented side by side with the classical chinese text, allowing the linguistically inclined one to compare the two. A great book alltogether."
4,A great read. Not sexual at all.,"I don't know where the idea that this book was a gay novel came from. There's really no sexual overtones and all of the main characters are interested in people of the opposite sex at various points in time. There are only two kisses in the entire book and that's as far as it goes. So if you wanted this book for sex, look elsewhere.That said, this is really a splendid read. The ending is the most shocking part, so make sure to read to the very end. Definitely a twist you don't expect. The whole concept of a vampire who is focused on becoming a literary genius by stealing artistic ability is fresh and exciting. Highly recommended."
4,Pilates Mat - great but smelly at first,"I love this mat! I am a Pilates Instructor and I do recommend it. Even some of my students got it after seeing mine. There are only a few things I don't like. First - the smell. It was awful. It took a few months to go away. But it did go away! Some folks mentioned they cleaned it with warm water and soap, and it help for the smell to go away faster. Second, because it can only be rolled one direction, so it creates a permanent curl on one end. It's not a big deal though."
1,regretting it,"Hi,I am highly regretting buying this mat.It is too bulky to carry.And it came on sale in Big 5 for half the price of Amazon."
5,Great Mat,"This mat is the thickest I could find and for 30 bucks it's an excellent deal. Just recommended to my roommate, she'll probably get the same mat as well."
4,Good matt a little sticky,"I bought this for home use, so really it's not fair to accuse it for being too sticky. It's just that we have cats, and it picks up the hair from the carpet (of course we keep a clean house, but you know)Anyhow it gives great shock support, and it longer than expected. That's a great bonus for tall folk. I love the integral straps as it helps keep it all together!A great product I'd recommend as it's important to have some support, and softness for your body."
4,good so far,"I like the mat it has good cushion. I would say that it may be a bit narrow but other than that, it's good"
5,Fine product,Works great! I did have to air it out when I first opened it but after that I've been very happy with it.
2,Tedious!,"This would be a great book for current readers of Nancy Drew mysteries. Written on the same didactic, wordy, obvious, and pre-adolescent level. Read a Mabel Maney book for an intentionally funny (and racy) take on Nancy!"
4,with elegance and grandeur,"with elegance and grandeur this symphonie is played. I can compare this record to Inbal for Teldec. I prefer that version. It is hard to get as is always the case with works by Inbal. Both conductors stress a different point. For Inbal, elegance and vehemence go together. For Chailly, elegance and softness go together. The Chailly version is slow, but not too slow. Makes things beautiful. This is for me the best symphonie by Bruckner. The song-cycle is good, but too short in order to make any impression. Sound-quality is good. Four stars because of the bargain which shortens the book about this recording."
5,First Time Scythe User.,"I have never used a scythe before buying this blade and the aluminum snath. I need to keep the weeds down on approximately 9000 linear feet of microjet irrigation polytube in my 5 acre grove. I have tried trimmer mowers, grass trimmers, weed whips, in combination with herbicides, with marginal results. I decided to try the weed scythe.. I am amazed how well it works. I use less effort to get the job done than with the motorized devices. It slices through the thick weeds including any woody plants. No unnecessary noise, pollution, and I minimized the use of herbicides."
1,Not really a discus beginner reference book,"I have bought this book thinking to include discus in community tank - so what I needed was a general guide to choosing and buying discus, a book to help me decide whether my community tank is any good for this not easy fish, what I got instead is a book concentrated TOTALLY on BREEDING - if you need beginner info on breeding discus the book might help even though it's too general to be of real help. If you are just considering keeping discus this book won't help - there is not any practical detail info on how to choose and keep these fish. And also there are plenty of pictures in the book but not enough used to illustrate the text. I wish I'd have chosen different book!"
1,No Guts,"This shaver is like many ladies shavers. Unless your hair is as fine as a frog's, it has no guts. If your hair is a little coarser, do yourself a favor and purchase a quality men's shaver instead."
4,The best of the boxsets,"Of the four boxsets, this is the best of Camp Classics series.Land of the Pharaohs isn't that campy. It just lacks the umph in casting and dynamics. it's like watching a TLC show about how to build pyramid. Joan Collins does get whipped. Bogdanovich's commentary includes tapes of his interviews with director Howard Hawks.The Colossus of Rhodes is an out of control Italian epic about the statue. it's loaded up with fighting and bare chests. Sergio Leone keeps the weirdness coming at Rory Calhoun. Mr. Burns loves this.The Prodigal is the camp best. You have the Prodigal son fighting a vulture! Plus Lana Turner....yummy. Slaughter the calf to get this film in your collection."
3,Good Reference,"If you're in the spfx make-up industry, this is a great reference to have...however, there are some downsides: LOTS of text and black & white pictures."
2,The content of this book is rather weak.,"This is a weak book. 1. The font size has been made big to make the book span more pages. There is content for perhaps 70 pages of normal sized text. 2. The writing is not insightful. There is no real substance to the cliches the writer keeps offering.This book is one of those self-help books that tries to make you feel good about yourself, but gives very little concrete knowledge. I do not know how much one could say about property flipping anyhow. As a concept it is interesting to know, as an investment tool it surely ain't for most people. If you are interested about flipping properties (doing fast deals with them), then perhaps you should buy this one. Atleast it is a cheap way to get introduced to a concept. If you are looking for insightful view on the real-estate world, keep on searching.I have yet to find a single good real-estate investing book so there is nothing else I could recommend you to replace this."
2,Disappointing fluff!,"This book is a hodgepodge of info bits that don't delve into the fundamentals that you actually need to apply when going about your real estate investments. I've had the fortune of reading many other satisfying books, but this is, by far, the worst real estate book I've read. Very disappointing. If you're serious about this field, I recommend THE COMPLETE GUIDE TO BUYING AND SELLING APARTMENT BUILDINGS by Steve Berges and INVESTING IN REAL ESTATE--both of these contain real fundamentals and principles."
2,Older sketch comedy before Carol Burnette days,"This is Tim from the early 50s to the mid 60s? Before his days on Carol Burnett. Tim's strength is his physical comedy & spontaneous witty ad-lib. He also does best when another actor tries to hold in a laugh at his jokes & that gives Tim confidence to do what he does best & go off the script. That barely happens once in this hour program when a ringing phone didn't happen & he pretending to be psychic (I forget) & the other actor died laughing. I wished Tim kept going, but he went back to the script. All stage skit material from different variety shows, many of them having Tim play a character called ""Dag Hartford"" as a jockey, car driver, hippie, caveman, etc. It's the same character, the type that's slow, thick-headed, etc. But nowhere near as good as his days on Carol. There's almost no physical comedy as well."
1,Yuk!,"Amazon should refund everyone's money who have ever purchased this awful product. I will NEVER buy anything from them again unless they do. This is mis-represented, badly made, and should be given away free for target practice; Jeff, how could you allow this product pollution?"
4,great fun for everyone,"My grandson loves this, and he is 13. Glad he enjoys something that is not violent!"
2,Great performance as always - but why bother?,"I don't want to get off on the wrong foot here - I was once a die-hard John Rutter fan. But, things have changed. His music, though beautiful and always extremely well performed, is just garbage. This is the most insipid collection to date (unless you consider the Requiem a collection). His music from his college years (The Falcon comes to mind) is wonderfully engaging: Original, thoughtful, moving - the whole kit-and-kaboodle. But it seems like his music from the late 60's on is just pandering to the populous who would really rather be listening to some guitar mass. Rutter is obviously too talented a composer and musician to be stuck in this syncopated D Major poppy schleck. We (serious clssical musicians) love you and wish you the best on your journey back to the fold of ""taste""."
1,this book should be recalled,I absolutely agree with Kevin J. Mcfarland's comment: the reproductions in this book are of a very shoddy quality. A lot - not all of them but probably more than half - are out of focus (they honestly seem like blown-up copies of the images in the original). The color is also quite bad. Stay away from this book unless you're buying it for the essay. And publisher - this is an embarrassment.
2,It was ok information.,"The information was almost accurate, thats why the source of the information is so important. Don't beleive everything you see or hear..."
4,A Debt of Gratitude.,"I am appaled at the other reviews, Fatwas of the Imams of the Mosques of NitPicking. Who cares whether Romans pressed their bulls-eye glass, or spun it? Valdemar is not a district of Rome. My greatest wish was not for more accurate research in how things happened in our middle ages nor in Valdemars' history, my greatest wish was to be there, in Valdemar, helping however I could. That hunger for immersion is my test for the quality of a book, and this one gets 4 stars with no reservations. These Valdemar books lit up a desire for reading in half my children, for that I am in the authors' debt.Myste creates and chronicles lovable and hateable people, characters who are multi-talented, dedicated, and lamentably human. Companion or no, Gift or no, I'd buy a ticket to Valdemar at whatever price. Sadly, I'll haver to wait for another novel instead, and re-read the ones I have in the mean time."
3,Mounting problems,The Astak CM-812C2 2.4 GHz Security and Surveillance Camera Set is OK. The only problems so far is mounting the camera from any surface but from below. You can't mount it under an eve from the home or even in the top frame of the window. It has an upside down image if mounted this way. Also it can't be positioned at an angle if mounted on a vertical frame of a window. On the instructions it shows this type of mounting but it is not able to be done as such. I'm sure most applications the surface to install would be from above as it would suspend from a ceiling or eve. If there is a way to do this please let me know. I says nothing in the directions how to accomplish this. Paul at h2o_carver619@yahoo.com. Thank You
2,BEWARE:there are two titles by this name. Be sure to get the 1 U want.,"I thought I was getting the book about improving financial situation and putting more emphasis on your life and relationships, and less on money. As I started the book, I was totally confused. I do like books about politics, history, etc. But I do not like books with a partisan bias, and try to avoid them, because, I am constantly countering points made by partisan authors. I have knowledge from my vast reading and pass history, geography, and political quizes with 100% correct. Thus regardless of the political bent, if there is one, there are usually misstatements. It is distracting to read a book that is frequently giving rise to mental remarks about the fallacies, and giving rise to annoyance with illogical thinking, etc. Thus, I found this book a poor read despite some good stories."
1,Enjoyed 25% of the Book,"I enjoyed 25% of the book, thus I give it 1.25% stars. The rest of the 75% was standard bias. I enjoyed the stories about bad bosses and the 'advice' chapter. I turned the page anytime he mentioned 'Republican', 'Democrat', 'liberal', or 'conservative'. I don't find drawing lines productive to the discussion. This is not fair and balanced when your commentary heavily echoes one side. If it were fair and balanced, then we would not be able to tell where the journalists' bias lays."
2,Nothing really new,"This book seems to be a marketing effort.There's nothing really new, and no new concept.It may be of some interest if you know nothing about Risk Management. If you are not a begginer, it's a waste of money and time."
1,"Good ideas, bad execution","The book has promise, but fails to deliver, especially toward to the end of the book. The storyling becomes completely unbeleivable and the characters are , well, out of character. The dialouge is forced and unnatural. Overall I was disappointed with this book and would not recommend it."
5,Tips are us!,"Excellent CD - all has been said already, just wanted to let you know you can get this CD much cheaper at John's website. That's what I did."
1,Lens Sharpness,"The lens was advertised as ""Tack Sharp"", which is what you would expect from an f2.8 setup. It was not - poor results - may have been a bad sample who knows. It shipped through Amazon supplier Cameta, and they took it back - VERY easy process - zero hassle. I was concerned that on-line would be riskier than in-person. It was actually a Better transaction - go figure."
3,gift for my niece,My grown niece has always wanted to see this film since it was filmed on the lake she spent her childhood on. She still spends every summer there as an adult and was amazed that I was able to find this movie.
4,Not as scary as I remember,"I remembered this movie from when I was 5 or 6 years old, and it haunted me for years afterwards. Not as scary as I remember, but I'm a big girl now so maybe that has something to do with it :) The scary movies from the 70's era have an eerie quality that you don't find in the horror movies of today, and ""Jessica"" is certainly no exception. But if you're looking for a lot of action and thrills, this isn't the movie for you."
5,Exquisite!,"The selections are gorgeously sung and spiritually moving beyond anything I can think of, right up there with Verdi's Requiem. My teen, who thinks rock music is the only music, was so moved by Samuel Barber's Agnus Dei, that she asked for her own copy of the CD. If you are already a believer, this music will remind you why you are. If not, it might just take you there."
2,Worth 29 cents!,"I got this as one of the ""50 SciFi Classics"" in the $11.99 collection of that name. Boy, what a stinker! Why was it made? Who were these people? Did money exchange hands?Favorite part: When the comely star, Jean Hankshaw (you remember her from...uh...""Wild Women of Wongo""), wrestles the dead aligator for an interminable amount of time before she realizes it is dead. Well, not exactly but close enough.I'm trying to resist buying the Mystery Science Theater (Film Crew) version of this movie since I couldn't help noticing what a great mark it would have been for those guys and darned if they haven't done it."
4,Hysterically Funny,"Laugh out loud no-brainer. Just sit back and prepare to be thouroughly amused. This movie is not meant to do anything by entertain us, so don't expect any sort of psychological revelation. And watch out for that BIG woman from the other village, or you'll dump your popcorn!"
3,Just an Okay Chick Flick,"I was feeling like a cute chick flick, but overall was a little disappointed with the entire movie. The movie really has no true point I guess, it even lost the cute chick flick feel. There was no character that I felt inline with, no one I could sympathize with, there just wasn't a character that kept me involved in the movie. It comes of too sappy, just not a movie that fill the bill so to speak. I really consider it a decent 'C' movie at best; okay to watch as a freebie, but I would never actually purchase this movie."
1,Annoying,"I couldn't make it past the first 10 minutes of this movie, it was beyond annoying. Brittany Murphy's ""accent"" really turned me off."
2,Brittany Murphy is unbearable,I saw the stars/reviews and I was so let down by this movie. Brittany Murphy plays a British Girl that has an American accent. It makes me wonder if they changed the character's background because she was so bad with the accent.
4,A scholarly treatment and fun to read at the same time,"Peter Garber's short book pokes holes in the view that markets today can exhibit ""irrational exuberance"" simply because it is ""well known"" that they did so in the cases of the Dutch Tulipmania and Mississippi and South Sea Bubbles. He says a bubble can only happen where there is no fundamental economic rationale for the rise and subsequent fall in prices. He states that these early events may not have been bubbles. He provides coherent explanations for these events based on economic fundamentals, and he supports his argument by analyzing the available price data in historical, economic, and political context."
2,Smoker Box,"It's cast Iron, made in China. First time I used the chips caught fire producing little smoke and a good bit of flame. Not complicated to use, seemed to allow too much oxygen to get in."
5,Smoker box,"This cast iron smoker box should last a lifetime. They are heavy duty and work great.If you need a smoker to hold the BBQ smoker chips, this will work super for you."
2,Item was chipped/damaged,Item was chipped/damaged...................................................................
2,Slip sliding away..,"Unfortunately, as soon as this mat gets a little bit sweaty - it's like a slip n' slide. It may be fine for low impact stretching or cardio but as soon as you're forced to be in a plank position or other stretching positions, there is no chance for your hands to stay in place. Not impressed."
2,Smelly but comfortable,It is a comfortable mat but the smell is terrible. It has a sour smell that will not go away. I had to put the mat in the garage so it would not smell up the house.
4,Decent Mat,This exercise mat worked fairly well. I didn't notice anything special about it but it was comfortable. The only thing I didn't like was that it attracts every spec of dirt and dog hair so it is always dirty.
3,OK Exercise mat,Good buy if you need a mat for doing your daily routine exercise. Comfortable and price is not too high.
3,okay mat.,Mat's an okay mat for the money. I bought to use with P90x. Sometimes it is a little to slippery and a little too spongy for the cardio workouts.
3,Decent mat but too slippery,"This mat is a pretty decent mat and serves it's purpose as a cushion to relief impact on your knees and joints. It's great for stretching and floor exercises. However, I noticed that on my high intensity days, my sweat makes the mat really slippery. It has gotten to a point that I stopped using the mat altogether. Additionally, it tend to move around quite a bit when you move around on it, so be careful when using it on carpet or hardwood floor.Pros: Thick soft cushion, great at absorbing impacts.Cons: Too soft for yoga stretches, very slippery when you sweat on it (does not absorb sweat), does not stay in place (hardwood or carpet)"
2,The fumes really worry me!,"Maybe in ten years I'll know if this is a good product (if I don't have some weird obscure cancer from the fumes). I would have expected them to dissipate after I left it lying flat for several days and using it several times over the last month, but they're still as strong as ever. The mat works well, though, and if I don't have some weird obscure cancer from the fumes in ten years' time, I'll edit my review to give it a higher rating. To do so now would to be premature, though!!"
3,Nice cushion,"I bought this despite the reviews that mentioned the smell. It does stink. I unrolled it and left it outside for a couple of weeks to air out before I used it, and that got rid of most of the smell. It's very nice and cushy, it's a great length, but I can still smell the stink when I'm in a position with my face close to it. And it seems like it wouldn't be too difficult to tear it."
5,Black and awesome.,I like this mat for the black color and when I do yoga I envision that I am a harbinger of pain and evil.
5,Comfort at a perfect price,I used this mat for the Insanity 60 day workout and it absorbs so much of the shock that comes from plyometric workouts. I notice no visible wear and tear from the use of it during the entire Insanity workout. It is also perfect for those long ab workout as it provides a memory foam like comfort. It is also very easy to clean with just a dry towel. I know you will like it if you try it.If this review helped you please give it a thumbs up. Thank you.
2,Well at least this covers better,"What can I say? Anne what happened??!! Awful, that's how to discribe it. Just horrible. Ussually I like Ms. Rice's books. I guess I should get a clue after finding the Rosie O'Donnell likes to indulge herself with Rice's books and bon bon's at the same time!! Rambling, and rambling. Sexual tensions fill the book. She even has sex with Marius after they became vampires. I thought Vampires couldn't have sex, at least that's what I was led to belive..by her. Anyway, save some money, and time. You can get all this in the other books. The only good part was the first chapter where David meets her. Two Vampires face off!! Was hoping for a little Vampire fight. Would have been pretty cool. But once she starts writing, everyone starts going to sleep. Pretty usless and bad. Should we place Ann on the shelf next to Jackie Collins and Dannelle Steel...under TRASH?!"
1,Goodbye Ann,"I've loved Ann Rice's writing from the beginning and have read all her works (with the exception of Servant of the Bones and Violin which I couldn't bear to finish). The quality of her work has slowly degenerated since Taltos, and Pandora is one of her poorest efforts. The book reads like a sales pitch for her other novels and repeats much info found in previous books. The references to other works is confusing for those who haven't read them and not neccessary for those who have. I agree with others who note she seems to be repeating information to pad a weak story. There were one or two glimmers of the style and imagination that made Ann Rice novels thrilling, but alas, they quickly vanish leaving a weak, unsatisfying and seemingly unfinished novel. I think in the future, I'll save my money for authors who have something interesting (and new) to say."
4,Pandora,"it's a good book, i love her vampires, they're very human and she's so detailed, that it feels like you're going through the things that happen as well."
3,On the right track but a tad too slow,"Anne Rice's Pandora was an interesting revival of the vampire theme, especially after her recent novels which seemed to exclude all mention of them. Unfortunately, it was lacking the richness of Anne's writing which I have enjoyed over the years. Perhaps if it was longer and more in depth I would have been able to rate it higher. I also realize not every novel is going to be a great one; and that's life in general."
5,great book but to short,"Pandoras story should have been about the 2,0000 yrs. after becoming a Vampire. The only flaw is to much of the book is devoted to her childhood and not enough to her experiences as a Vampire. Anne Rice is still the best storyteller around."
2,sketchy and dull,"Anne Rice's latest effort is a shadow of her previous vampire volumes. Not much story, dull lectures on minutiae, laughable dialogue. I miss the richly textured histories that her books used to be. Now it seems like she's just cranking them out under a deadline. I miss the old Anne Rice."
4,I really ike this book!,The book was relly interesting and had a good storyline. my favorite part was when she had to dress herself for the first time.
1,Please stop me before I read another book by Ann Rice!,"I keep buying and reading Ann Rice's latest efforts hoping they will be as good as her earlier works, but to no avail. Wading through this murky mess has, hopefully, cured me from wishing to read anything else written by her again. This book was so boring that it was difficult to keep focused from one page to the next. Pandora should have had a stake driven through her heart before the third chapter. Having read almost all of Ms. Rice's earlier works, which I thoroughly enjoyed, I desperately wanted to take pleasure in reading this book. Unfortunately, this was not the case. The idea of the main character surviving from anicent Rome to modern times is such a fascinating concept that should have held the reader's interest from the beginning to the end of the book. However, much more was promised than was delivered."
2,"We love them so much, at least make it worth our while!","Come on Anne! We've waited for tales of the Vampires after Lestat decided to check out (and you know as well as I do that he's coming back, he's made you enough money for a revival) but you tease us with Pandora! One of the ancients, yet she's only worth a paltry 353 pages?! She's over 2000 years old, shouldn't her story span at least that long? Nice imagery, good dialog, MUCH to short!"
2,"Same story, different viewpoint, not worth the trouble","The story seemed rushed toward the end, like the moment you realize that a sitcom is going to be a two-parter; there's too much to say and there's not enough time to finish. The book is boring and repetative in parts and not innovative at all. Rice's work is too formulaic now, once you've read acouple, you get the general gist. At least this one wasn't so theological."
3,Not her worst yet not her best either.,"What can I say about this book? Well it wasnt awful or mind numbing like Vittorio. But it wasnt fantastic or incredible like Armand either. Read it if your in the mood for some Annes gabbling but if you dont it wont make much of a difference, its just Anne trying to make a pretty mediocer character interesting and not really succeeding.I really wish she would shine the spotlight on Marius for a change. Why does she constantly make him a supporting charater or even worst, just plain ignore him all together? She made him up for Gods sake why cant she see his potential?"
4,Good! Explains many details left out in other books,"The story was compelling, and explains much of how she got to be the vampire (and attitude) she is at ""present"" time. Only Complaint: What happend to the one legged Vampire?????"
1,BIG disappointment,"I had a really hard time reading this book. It was dull and lifeless, not at all the Anne Rice of the past Vampire Chronicles. She spent the first couple chapters telling David a bunch of information he already knows!! I found that a trite way to relay information. This was definitely, in my opinion, a throw-it-against-the-wall book. Apparently, Anne is only writing these vampire books because her ""public"" wants it. Her heart is not in it."
2,disappointing,"I used to be a fan of Rice (Anne, that is), but no longer. After the famous Trilogy of vampires (the third of which was the weakest), we have been snared by lesser and lesser efforts. I won't attempt another. This one was pretty on the outside and filled with air."
2,boring,"I used up about two months to finish this book. The longest period ever. The story mainly concentrate on the two characters Pandora and Marius, focus on their argument, their disagreement, this is boring, I fell asleep many times and have no incentives to catch up the story. The gory scene is not enough, it seems like a love story more than a vampire story. One thing I appreciate most is only the discription of the art of Rome."
2,only for her,"Because I believe Anne Rice is a great writer, I am giving this book 2 stars. Otherwise, I wouldn't give it one. It was boring, boring, boring, and I was disappointed, disappointed, disappointed to the point where I have not read any of her works since."
2,"Good yarn, but where's the meat?","I will continue to buy every book that this (too?) prolific writer produces. Why? Because you never know when you're going to get a true gem. I was looking forward to a meaty tale about a female vampire in Pandora, but what I found was a rather tame love story. True, Pandora is a strong, willful female and an interesting character in her own right. That and the close-up look at the young Marius was worth the read. But surely Anne had something more in mind when she named this female vampire Pandora. I'm confident that I am not alone in thinking we would get the ""inside story"" on the legend of Pandora's box. What happened to that tale? I'm now happily deep in The Vampire Armand and look forward to many more of Anne's books. Hopefully, they will be more substantial than Pandora."
3,Fun to read,Great for nostolgia. If you are a 20th Century buff these are source documents for the attitude toward war and race and other issues of those turbulent times.
4,NAZI POW's in the U.S.,An interesting book on a neglected subject in American history. I recommend this book for any student of History.
2,Great Content - poor execution,"Rather than let us see a little black on either side, the makers of this disc felt the need to stretch the videos from their original 4:3 aspect ration to a modern 16:9. The result is what can only be called a big MESS. I'm going to hang onto the disc but only because of the one or two rarities it contains. It will be gone as soon I have properly formatted versions of all the videos. I definitely don't recommend this unless you just can't live without a video that is unavailable elsewhere."
1,Easily Destroyed,My neighbor's small dog made light work of this within an hour. I don't recommend because the pieces could easily be swallowed or choked on.
4,"Decent quality, but on the expensive side for press board.","I've had this unit for over a year now. I store only DVD's in it. The unit is sturdy, and fits well in the corner that I needed it to. I am considering buying a second one... but for that price I think I will wait till I know I am really going to need it."
4,Teach Poetry? Use this book!,this is one of the best tools i have used in my classroom. my students are mostly minorities and they went from a group that complained about poetry to a group that enjoyed poetry! i highly recommend this book!
5,"execellent service,fast shipping,",The book was almost like new. I liked it. I am satisfied with the product. Thanks.
2,Not crazy about it,"After reading the review I was so disappointed. Applied exactly as instructed. Used 2 coats. It gives your nails a whitish look. I prefer clear as I don't wear colored polish. So wasn't happy about that. Then followed with the never break laminate. The No Wraps lifts and peels away. Especially on the sides of my nails in big chunks. No I didn't apply it too thick. And I constantly use hand cream and wash dishes with gloves on, I much prefer the Instant Artificials. It lasts a long time. Is clear. And is very durable."
5,I have this CD!!!!!!!!,This CD is amazing.I love it sooooo much.Sparckel and shine is so cool.The music makes me dance.So Good is Soooooooooo goooooooooooooood.I cant wait to get the whole CD album.SARA SIBLINI!!!MY SCENE LOVER!!!BRATZ LOVER!!!*FOREVER*
5,The Rainmaker,"I ordered this movie because it is one of my all time favorites dating back to the days when Hollywood really had STARS. No high school dancing, no changing into super heroes, a story line easy to follow and a happy ending for one and all."
3,It feels clean but...,"Doesnt have the hold I am used to - which is more or less lacquer, so maybe it is an adjustment thing. Perhaps two spritzings will do the trick but I do like the idea of all natural and love their other products."
1,Blink 182 Interviews DVD sucks,"This DVD was horrible.Tom Delonge was not even in it, which automatically ruins it.The sound quality is completely aweful.Also, they keep bringing in random people, making things more nad more confusing."
5,Techno Addict,"This is a good addition to your techno collection.I can't identify any specific song that really rocked me. However, I can say they they all did, from start to finish.I am constantly searching for great techno bands. I think a group is really good if I feel I should buy a second or third CD from that same group. Bottom line:I would buy another CD from Distorted Reality.It's not harsh like some industrial stuff I've listened to (e.g. Combichrist or Wumpscut), yet it's not generic background techno blather either (Synth Pop I think they call it). I've found web sites that catogorize electronic music by group and sub-genre, but they are not all consistent. So let me put it this way, Distorted Reality falls in-between. I would put them between Neurotic Fish or Mind-in-a-box and a band like Ego Likeness (which I found to be a little softer but still good)."
1,A waste of time,"Very disappointing. This book has too many religious undertonesof ""repent or face the consequences"" to be of any interestto the serious investigator of ancient history or those interested in the suppressed origins of civilization. The titlepromises to challenge the origins of ancient history and provide a controversial investigation in to the creation story, but does not deliver. I found it to be the same oldstory,in which an individuals's religious views are presented as serious interpretations of ancient text in an effort to suppress discoveries or alternative theories that challenge Christian beliefs and/or boundaries. I highly suggest to the serious investigator of the orgins of civilization and/or ancient history not to bother with this book, there are more serious books on the subject available."
2,The author got it wrong.,"Sorry. The Nephilim were the Watchers who came to earth to corrupt the family of man. They were very large in stature, highly intelligent, and had a malignant mission. Unlike our DNA, theirs could produce offspring with any animal on earth. They loved human women and fathered hundreds of thousands of giant children. The remnants of those giants are still floating in our gene pools. Their remains can be found in nearly every state and country in the world.I'm surprised Mr. Ajiake missed the real reason the Nephilim came here in the first place.If you really want to know the results of the Nephilim's activities on ancient earth, you need to read The Ark of Millions of Years. That is the most accurate book eveyr written on the subject."
4,"Enjoyable, but not what I really expected","I ordered the book in preparation for a first-time visit to the Outer Banks. I found the book interesting and enjoyable, but I think I was hoping for an overview of the history of the area so I would know more about the places we would see. I do recommend the book, but I still need something a bit different. The failure to find what I need is probably my own, so I can't fault the book."
3,Can't wait for the next release,"We were in a funk because we had just finished the Samurai Champloo series, and were searching for something to feed our anime addiction. For the past couple of years we've been hooked on Noir, Madlax, Fruits Basket, Saiyuki, R.O.D. and Cowboy Bebop. Phantom is similar to other anime in the chick assasin genre, particularly Kite. The pre-release reviews were good. We were pleasantly surprised by Phanton, and thought it deserved the write-up."
4,Good Bow With Help,"We added another $100. worth of items to it for better accuracy and use: Whisker buscuit, pin site and no-glove. It shoots great and has a solid feel. The blue color is bright. 4 stars for limited literature. I would expect more instruction and explanation for the price. You get a small booklet explaining all of the models together. Meh."
4,Chucky Margolis RULES!!!,"The only reason I bought this set of Hudson Brothers shows is for the Chucky Margolis skits. I used to laugh so hard I'd almost pass out. Chucky lives in his basement and has never seen his parents, the only time they come into contact with him is when they throw food down to him. His buddy Allen crawls through the basement window to visit him. And that's where we always visit with Chucky, through the basement window. He and Allen talk about their adventures and crazy stuff they do. There is one Chucky Margolis skit over on Youtube, I think it's the very first one. Chucky and Allen talk about how they snuck upstairs when the parents were away, Chucky drank some green water from a long tube, then threw up in the aquarium. Hi-larious."
3,A few good songs.,"When I bought this CD the only song I knew was ""Ist es Wichtag? Since the song sounded like U2 from the same era(late 90's), I thought the disk was worth a shot. Overall the disc is average. Sort of grundge/indie rock sound. Now, I am a big fan of Wir Sind Helden so I was hoping it was like them. It's not. But, for the right price, it's okay. WARNING:The Lyrics are in German and there is no lyric sheet in the disc so you will be lost unless you speak German."
1,Nasty book,"Like the author herself, this book is mean-spirited and puts doing away with the competition before gaining insights. It's spiritually impoverished, learning without wisdom. Mean-spirited."
2,Very basic,"For those of you looking for one or two comprehensive volumes to truly prepare you, think twice about this book. There are three chapters covered that you are not even tested on, all of which have tons of information. The emphasis of anatomy, physiology and kinesiology details is lacking in the book in comparison to the material covered in the test. I am not allowed to say what is on the test but i will tell you it is thorough and very detailed, medical terminology is essential and hardly covered in this book.I'd seek a A&P; text for a university if i were you, even audit a class if you can.The practice exams provided on the CD-ROM barely followed the way the test is laid out outside of it being multiple choice.I am keeping this book because i think it will make a good general reference/guide but is not one i'd recommend, especially if you are not fresh out of massage school."
5,Very effective...,"I bought this item months ago, but never used it till last weekend. It worked perfectly as designed blocking all light in it's direction. You can easily concentrate your light source where you want it and especially away from where you don't want it. It doesn't ""Reflect"" the light back and make the opposite side brighter, but rather just stops light from passing through.This reflector allowed to me set my boundaries on each side of my fishing spot without blinding my neighboring fishermen. Also, it fits perfectly inside the Red Coleman carrying case without a problem. I'm going to buy a 2nd and 3rd for my other two lanterns."
5,Unbelievably Hilarious!,"This is a book geared towards young adolescents, but adults will find themselves laughing hysterically from page to page. It is an incredibly well-written story and contructed quite cleverly. I was disappointed to hear that it was out of print- I lost my copy several years ago and would LOVE to add this to my library again. If you can find a copy, pick it up- you'll be glad you did!"
5,Just Hillarious!,"This book is a great book because it's fast and funny. You never know whats going to happen next. The book is about a young boy who has to go to camp because of his guidence cunsellers at school. Then he gets a brilliant idea, if camp algonkian isn't standing no one can expect him to stay...."
5,A Truly Great Book,"This is one of the stories I remember with stark clarity from my childhood. I loved it and still do. It's one of the reasons I decided to become a writer. I highly recommend this book to anyone of any age. There's more to this story than what's on the surface. I think it speaks strongly about being the person you want to be, despite what everyone else thinks. Rudy Miller is as individual as a character gets. The mere thought of him still cracks me up. If you don't buy it, find it and just read it. You'll see what I mean."
4,"An EASY read, it was Good but not great.","I used this as a last minute review guide to brush up. Very short and to the point, except it doesn't cover the details needed from a more detailed Study Guide. I used this along with Microsoft Press - Networking Essentials, and the Transcender exams. BTW I passed with a 933..."
5,Bought this as a gift for my niece....,"She loved it! Not sure on the quality yet because it's only been washed once, but the art was beautiful and very unique."
4,Great read,"Sonnenschein effectively covers the theory behind shaping the soundtrack, and gives great examples of the ideas in action. I loved the candid quotes from masters like Ben Burtt, Gary Rydstrom, Walter Murch, Dane Davis, and others. I started noting down all of the films he mentions as examples of good sound design, until I noticed Sonnenschein was one step ahead and had already noted them all in the back. Only 4 stars 'cause I personally wanted more technique and a little less theory."
5,FANTASTIC!!!,"I *love* this book! And so does my 3 year old daughter. The artwork is beautiful and so wonderful to look at. The story is *awesome* and just great for little girls [and boys!].The author has a superb wit and a gift for storytelling. This has quickly become one of our very favorites and my daughter spends lots of time now pretending to be ""Rumplestiltskin's Daughter"" [who also had a name!]. I'm very happy with the impact this tale has had on her sense of what it is to be a woman.This tale encourages girls to be clever and self sufficient without being tedious or overbearingly feminist. [And without being anti-male]. I can't recommend this book highly enough!"
5,Nice idea,My husband got this for his acoustic guitar. We are looking forward to using it at our next OA convention.
1,save your money,"Poorly arranged and just not useful.. was hoping it would be a good jump start to my upcoming cruise, but felt like a mini quiz"
3,Don't be fooled as these are small bottles .,Thought these bottles larger than the approx 2oz size for the $30 price tag. I should have done more research. At $6 a bottle I wouldn't do that again even though the lotion is very nice and lasts a good while. Nowhere did it tell me this was only a sample size pack. I feel ripped off as I could find the same sample size pack going for $10 elsewhere. I sure wish KY would put this back in stores .
2,Meh,These lotions smell like regular lotions. There was nothing special about it! save your money and buy something else more exotic and that smells better.
3,A nice book,"My wife does the cooking, but she has enjoyed the book. They have simpler recipes than some of the other raw foods books and take less time to prepare. I would recommend it."
1,Not good,"My problem with this book isn't the use of blender and other machines which make the title incorrect, but the recipes themselves which are bland, unappealing, sometimes terrible."
3,use to supplement other raw books,"I may be missing something, but I found this to be more sauces and dressings than anything.... which are easy and flavorful but not really meals in and of themselves."
4,1st 1/2 Better,"Undeniably great music, but energy literally peters out to slow, maudlin that about pitched me into catatonia. Perhaps I prefer only first 5 years."
2,Divine Emanuelle: Love Cult,"AFTER WATCHING THIS DVD, I CAN TRUELY SAY, THAT IT IS TIME TO PACK IT IN ON THE EMANUELLE SERIES. ACTING SUCKS, BUT NOT THE GIRLS, PLENTY OF T & A, BUT IT'S ALWAYS THE SAME. GREAT TO HELP YOU SLEEP."
4,rayban glasses 3269,glasses are great the only problem was i had to tweek frames a little to fit my face.Also the glasses took longer than originally promised to arrive.
5,Lavender's Blue,"I first got this book at the library 15 years ago when my first child was a baby, and he and I loved it so much that I ordered a copy (ours is quite tattered.) It has lots of rhymes I grew up with and some less familiar to me. Cool pictures, and even some games to play with the rhymes. Now I'm ordering it for my little niece's first Christmas, a child whose mother's repertoire of nursery rhymes is sadly limited. I know she'll love it!"
5,Lavender's Blue. the nursery book icon,"This book is part of my childhood, part of the 1950s. Our family copy was so tattered by the sixth child my mother had to buy another one. the rhymes are deceptively simple, the actions and rhythms delicious for children and adults. This book was one of the books that as an older child I could entertain my younger brothers and sister with, and was part of our wet weather entertainment.I was fortunate enough to find a reprint in 1982 when my son was born, and he loved it too,,,""to market to market to buy a fat pig. home again home again jiggetty jig,,' was a particular favourite.Now he is having a child, and I'm so pleased to find it is still available for another generation"
1,Hilarious! Screamingly funny!,"This guy would make a good humor writer. I haven't laughed at a book so much in years! Evolution is supported by mountains and mountains of documented, irrefutable evidence from educated, professional, intelligent people who have simply followed the course of where their research took them. It's no longer about one guy who wrote one book in the mid-1800's. Not any more. Inform yourselves, people. I challenge anyone reading this to actually investigate how much supporting research there is out there for evolution in science, in astronomy, biology geology and physics. It's overwhelming. Check out some web sites from some universities and research institutes to get an idea of how research is being done on evolution all over the world. Do you think they're all in a conspiracy, and that they're just making it all up?"
1,Unconvincing,"It's actually a very simple question.Science is about making deductions from factual evidence. It has no means of explaining anything that is supernatural.However, religion requires the belief in supernatural forces and at least one supernatural being.That DOES NOT mean religion is wrong, it just means it is a different subject matter than science and therefore DOES NOT belong in a science classroom.You wouldn't expect English literature, music, history and other such subjects to be taught in a science classroom. Neither should religious beliefs. I, for one, am perfectly happy to have my religious beliefs kept out of science classrooms. I don't need science to tell me there is a God. I don't need - or want - my religious beliefs to force science to be conducted in a certain way. Quite frankly, anyone who feel that the honest teaching of science is a threat to their religious beliefs is someone who has great doubts about their religious beliefs!"
1,"Amusing, yet ultimately pointless.","The best part is when Johnson, during this tedious and endlessly fallacious appeal to authority, refers to the the celebrated physicist Richard P. Feynman as ""Richard Feinberg.""I also enjoyed the gratuitous characterization of Michel Foucault as a frequenter of gay bathhouses.This book is almost as funny as Robert Bork's ""Slouching Towards Gomorrah."""
5,A stunning achievement...brilliant.,"It's unfortunate that many Americans have shaped their (conspiratorial) views of the Kennedy assassination on Oliver Stone's J.F.K., rather than on this staggering, balanced and thoroughly researched work. Manchester, one of this country's pre-eminent historians, leaves no stone unturned in his quest to tell this tragic story. Like it or not, and many indeed will not, Manchester tells the truth: that Oswald did it, with help from no one."
3,The Hobo Philosopher,"I had a real problem with this book. This was one of the early books that came out on the Kennedy assassination. In this book Manchester accepts the lone gunman theory. I still can't buy it. There is too much information and too many books to the contrary - even congressional investigations. My opinion is that the national crisis and Manchester's friendship with the Kennedy family influenced his history. The entire Kennedy family has been mysteriously quiet on this subject. I have my own theory as to why. I am sorry, but I just don't believe his account. I don't consider this work up to Manchester's standards or ethics.Richard Edward Noble - The Hobo Philosopher - Author of:America On Strike - Labor History"
5,Fits like it should,"Built well, looks good, great feel, good comfort, but most of all, great product with a great price. I would buy this vendor again and again."
2,Nice but too small,"It is durable, but way too small. My 6in relector did not fit with the tripod. I barely could get it shut with the tripod in there. I will order another for the tube."
2,Forced darkness obscures innovation,"I found the sadism forced and excessive. I got the impression the author had disgusting things happen to characters just to push the envelope of what's acceptable in fantasy. At one point I actually found myself laughing out loud because some horrible secret ended up being so unbelievably stupid. Naming the good guys Saetan and Daemon seemed an immature attempt to explore how we define good & evil. That said... there IS something compelling about the characters, and the magical framework is really innovative and interesting. I would have enjoyed this book much more if torture occurred to advance plot and not for its own sake. I will be skipping the sequels."
5,Mother Night!,"To say that this book is great is probably the understatement of the year.I was mezmorized by the sexual darkness wrapped around the book. From youthful carefree days of traveling along the web, looking for anyone who wants to talk; to the youthful pain of realization that the world isn't as kind as a child needs it to be.Daemon the sexual lover and cold-hearted. Lucivar the wildly free brother and evil in his own extent. Saetan, the father, Lord of Hell, and most powerful Black-Jeweled Worlord-Prince ever lived. Jeanelle, the powerful little girl/Witch, whom everyone would die for.Full of evil, lust, death, pain, and the joyfulness of a child's laugh, ""Daughter of the Blood"" is one book I'll be sure to keep at the front of my library.The darkness has engulfed me.With two days under my belt for this first of the Black Jewel Trilogy, I'm eager to eat up the next novel ""Heir to the Shadows."""
4,I loved it but....,"It was a little hard to take in plces. The whole age difference was a bit much and the absolute horrific scene where Jaenelle's world is destroyed made me ill. Other than that, I enjoyed what Anne has begun. I read it and the sequel in consecutive evenings...hope she hurries up and gets book 3 out! I especially like the relationship between Lucivar and Daemon. Reminds me of me and my brother. Also loved Surreal. She should get her own series."
5,The best!,"Although I loved Interview With the Vampire, I did not finish reading it and start over again. I did that with Daughter of the Blood, though. I have read it 4 times now, and love every page of it!"
2,Just... eh,"I tried to read this book several years ago but could never get into it. The whole caste system is very confusing with little to no explanation (I've even researched the web on how it works) but still could not grasp how it works. This was the first book I ever failed to finish, which is a bit sad (for me). The overall ideas sound interesting enough, but it wasn't for me. Maybe in a few years I'll try again, but for now it's joined the Book Graveyard with the other novels I've disliked."
5,A must have!!,"I have been looking for this film for years!! Not knowing the title of the film left me at a disadvantage, but I simply could not forget the villain of the film, known as ""The Breather."" The very first time I saw this movie, I was about 10 years old, and it was featured on USA's Up All Night Movie lineup. This movie is the forefather to the ""Scary Movie"" films. A talley of murders, strange murder weapons, and a twist ending! Who could imagine being murdered by an eggplant?! Not to mention the main character in the film desperately tries to keep everyone from having sex (the virgin never gets killed ploy), winds up being the suspect. This movie is still hillarious 30 years later. If you like the horror/comedy spoof, this is the film for you. Strange, yet funny, this movie brings back so many childhood memories for me. If you can believe that!"
4,Why do I wear these golashes? It's not even raining!,"This movie is one of the best spoofs ever! I remember renting this movie over and over when I was a kid! I love the random way of killing, and the stupid tools he uses. The killers' character is so outrageous and his running commentary is hilarious. And let's not forget the one use of a certain cuss word just to get an "" R "" rating, because after all, that is what we want in our horror movies! I hope that they stop denying us this wonderfully funny movie. Trust me when I say, if you are a fan of horror, and especially the spoofs of horror, you'll love it."
2,If you are in the mood for a cheesy movie....,"""Student Bodies"" is not the type of movie for someone lacking a good sense of humor. It is cheesy and fun, but you must be in the right mood to enjoy the flick. I (along with a group of friends) have viewed it many times on USA's ""Up All Night"" and we have laughed each time. When I am out and about I still laugh everytime I see a horsehead bookend or galoshes."
2,Bad Movie that could have been good!,"If there was ever a movie that needed a lil TNA, this would be it. It had all the makings of a decent flick, but needed the random TNA. Im sorry, but this was not a good enough movie to warrent not having it."
1,the worst ever,"never watch it, every single minute is a waste of time. maybe those who rated it high are those who were annoyed and want others to be annoyed too"
2,Kinda sucked,"I read the reviews on this movie and thought that it would be pretty good, so I bought it and was I wrong. This movie sucked, I understand that it's a spoof movie and was supposed to be funny not scary but it wasn't even funny. RETURN TO HORROR HIGH is better, it's funnier and the deaths are better. I don't even understand how the BREATHER was killing people with an eggplant and where did it come from? Did he bring it with him? The paper clip was kinda funny but not really and the death scenes were over fast and you really don't see anything. The BREATHER kept stepping in gum and saying CLICK when he was on the phone with people-again NOT FUNNY, I usually really enjoy these types of movies because I do love scary movies so much but this movie just didn't do it for me and I am a little upset that I spent $[...] bucks on this. Unless you like senseless horror spoofs then don't waste your money on this film."
4,Talking? During horsehead bookends?,"Quite possibly my favorite movie. I have been raving about this movie since I first saw it over ten years ago, I've shown it to all of my friends, and every time I find somebody else who has already seen it, I immediately show it to them! Nothing against mainstream movies, but it's the cult movies that bring people together. If you are reading this and you love offbeat humor but haven't seen this movie, find it! After all, ""even the dead love a parade."""
5,A Beautiful Christmas classic!,"Rutter's settings of traditional Christmas carols give new life to some old favorites. The orchestrations are lovely, and the a capella selections will make you feel like you have the world's best English carolers standing on your doorstep. This CD includes many standard carols, and a few lesser-known ones, like the gorgeous ""All My Heart This Night Rejoices,"" which in my opinion deserves to be revived to familiarity. Also, the Cambridge Singers' performance of ""The Christmas Song"" is one of my favorite versions of that song...very lush! This CD is always a staple in my music rotation during the holiday season."
4,A surprisingly good movie,I picked this movie up about of a dollar bin and thought it would be as bad as most low budget films. I couldn't have been more wrong. The characters are deep and the humor is understated. If you are expecting a slap stick laugh tracked sitcom style movie because of the actors you are out of luck. When actors take themselves into a new role and play a different type of character I love it. The ending may have been a little predictable but I thought there were enough twists and turns to keep you wanting to see how they got there.Another important aspect of a DVD is the extras not just the movie. I think this is another place where this shines. The featurette is pretty cool and you should watch it if you liked the movie.
2,"Everyone loves the king of ..... wait, not this one they dont","Ray and Tubby play meat salesmen who wind up getting mixed up trying to sell meat to the mob and blah blah blahThe comedy is not strong, it's pretty slow in most parts, and it's not a fast paced movie.Wait for it to be on TV."
1,Boring and not funny,"I love Ray Romano and Kevin James, but maybe they are only funny in their TV shows. At least no one has given them a decent movie script yet and that includes ""Hitch"".This movie was absolutely terrible - not a funny scene in the whole movie, and I think it was supposed to be a black comedy - the type of movie I generally love. Save your money but most of all your time."
1,"Awful movie, great music","Boring and odd movie with an unbelievable plot and unrealistic characters. The only good thing about this movie is the soundtrack and wouldn't you know, there isn't a CD available! Don't waste your time even if you are a Kevin James fan...clearly not his best work."
3,"Not the best Sawyer, but pretty good","This is one of Sawyer's earlier novels. While it is not quite up to the standards of later works, (like THE TERMINAL EXPERIMENT), it has a great premise and is superior to most science fiction on the shelves today.Golden Fleece is a murder mystery - but the mystery is not who, we know that right away, it's the ""why?"" and ""will they be caught?"" The untangling of these two questions - aboard a generational ship, making it a locked room mystery for the passengers - has the backdrop of the psychology of a generational ship and how man deals with Artificial Intelligence."
3,eh,"this one is ok. it has good general info about very broad family medicine topics. it offers good information about preventative medicine which is important and most common diagnoses of family med such as diabetes, hypertension, male and female health, etc.. it does not offer specific information on topics that are more often seen on IMED. it may or may not be worth a buy depending on what other resources you are using."
4,Great book,"Hugo Dixon describes virtually every aspect of finance that the average individual needs to know to live in the world and survive, and he does it in such a way that even the most uninitiated can understand. This is truly a one of a kind book. I know of no other that covers the range in such an elementary manner. I constantly refer to it in addition to my more advanced books on finance."
2,Luke warm on this one,I never finished this book. Perhaps my expectations were too high as I like Shepard. Perhaps I'll give it another go later. Maybe not.
4,Linux Desktop Hacks,I read this book in about two days. The format is laid out in quick modular sections that cover just about everything from downloading and burning an iso all the way to recompiling your kernel. A day later I was genuinely pleased when I successfull did just that. The ability to bounce around the book for specific questions and answers is a ver positive feature. In some instances though the answers only apply if your running KDE or GNOME and equal covereage for both can be sporadic. The book is a handy guide to keep on a shelf for those problems that crop up at 2am that need immediate solutions. I feel this book is a worthwhile investment for a newbie to linux desktop environment.
4,Old and new Franklin songs gathered to inspire,"Krik Franklin / Songs from the Storm / Volume 1 : This CD does NOT contain Franklin's ""Hits"". This is music for and of the traditional Black Church, but contains Franklins semi-traditional new-groove songs, but many of these have previously been released. There are lots of uplifting songs here and a few not-so great ones, but it is a solid Four Star effort."
3,medium book about a big river,"This was a fine book to read on a long flight from the Far East back to Chicago. I did make it to O'Hare, and by that time had almost made it to the headwaters of the Yangtze. Winchester's book reads easily and was good rice to satisfy my present hunger for books about China--cooked nicely, tasty, and easily digestible. Winchester is a talented writer and a good observer. At times he seemed to be on cruise control, but that is a small matter. I felt like I was along for the ride, and learned a good deal more about China in so doing."
4,Loved the book; disliked the narrator,"Couldn't put the book down, so entrancing was it. So it should receive a ""10"", right? Unfortunately the author exudes a classically British air of disdain toward not only the Chinese people, but toward tourists, herbalists and just about anyone except British ex-pats. I don't think I'd like him.I read the book as part of my preparation for a trip to China, and am so glad I did. It's both fascinating and educational. And in spite of Mr. Winchester's sneers, I'm going to be one of those ugh! tourists who cruises the Yangtze. How else can I see what he so wonderfully describes?"
3,Title Says It All,This resource provides all sorts of information for the small business owner. Each topic is covered sparingly with pointers on where to find more in-depth information. Good desk reference for budding entrepreneurs.
5,This is a great book!,"In this book, Clayton Moore tells all about his life: how he got to be the Lone Ranger, what it was like for him to be the Lone Ranger, and much more. This book gives some great insight about what his life was like. In the middle of the book are two sections of pictures which I love to look at. This is definitely a book for all Lone Ranger fans!"
5,history of the tv lone ranger,"a great book, if any like me are a fan of the LONE RANGER buy it i don'tusully like storys about one's self butthis is a great book it is the life history of the lone ranger -clayton moore it's hard to put down tell about him and tonto and what the real reason he was fired and john hart played the role! buy it read it enjoy it!"
1,Pass on this,"As a devoted non-teenaged Buffy fan, I have spent more time than I care to admit surfing for decent Buffy/Angel sites. I wanted something other than the same set of publicity shots and badly spelled FanFic. I was excited by the concept of the Internet guide, but disappointed when I got the book. For the amount of money, I figured I would get a decent sized-book, and was dismayed to find it was only a pamphlet. I would say that at least 50% of the sites rated in the book no longer existed, or had moved, by the time I received it. If you know your way around search engines, you can pass on this one."
2,Tales of Silliness,"The Video ""Tales of Erotica"" which has 4 short movies is basically Tales of ""Silliness"" since none of the stories are based on erotic reality. My favorite was the final story, ""Wet"" which featured the beautiful Cynda Williams. The only erotic and exciting thing about this video is it's 4th story ""Wet"" and the nude shot of Cynda William's perfectly shaped buttocks as she rises from the hot tub dripping ""wet"" from the bubbly water......she is definitley worth looking at."
1,"3 out of 4 aint bad, unless you're wanting functional light bulbs","The bulbs themselves are fine. They're fairly bright for 40 watt bulbs.However, this rating is based on what I received. I opened the package of bulbs, and after testing each bulb, discovered that only 3 out of 4 work. Let me be a reminder to you to at least consider that things like light bulbs should probably be purchased from stores, not online."
4,Review of purchase,"I am overall happy with this Toastmaker product. I got it about a week after I ordered it. The only problem is no warranty or instructions. I hope it will last a few years, minimum. It takes about 10 or 11 minutes to bring 11 oz. of oatmeal to boil using a thick Corningware pot, which is a bit slow. It simmers pretty good at a setting of 1 1/2. My GE stove with 4 burners would burn my oatmeal (or any other small serving) if I wasn't standing right there watching it. It is a good product and I use it every day."
4,Working for over 2 years,I have had this unit for over 2 years and everything still works just as good as the day I bought it. I use it as my only stove almost daily as I live in a basement apartment. The only problem I have with it is that it takes a while to heat to the point of boiling but once there it stays hot.
3,Once Installed Its working as Advertised,"Installed Hopkins Brake Controller 47235 on a 2008 Dodge Ram 1500 Mega without a factory installed tow package. Picked up a wiring harness from Dodge for the truck specific for this year and model. Neither the Dodge wiring harness or the Hopkins Brake Controller had adequate documentation to install. I stumbled on a site for Dodge Ram ""www rambodybuilder com"" which goes back to 2004. It took this website to clearly identify what wires to splice into on the truck from the controller. Once I had all the info I was able to confidently and successfully install...and its working great. I'm running at 25% for my application."
2,Thank goodness it finally broke!,"After about 2 years of unevenly burned toast this thing died. For the last year the only way to get the toast up was by unplugging the toaster. Since the eject and the ""doneness"" share the same dial, you can't set the toaster to the perfect doneness and leave it at that setting...you have to continually fiddle with it. I would rate this as 1 star, however, I believe that my passionate hatred of this toaster may be clouding my judgement, so therefore I give it 2 stars."
5,Inolvidable,"Imprescindible disco para los amantes del ""lied"", que perpetúa la despedida de Gerald Moore. Destacan la belleza de la voz y el encanto de Victoria de los Angeles, la sabiduría de Elisabeth Schwarzkopf y la sensibilidad de Fischer-Dieskau. Grabación ""live"" de buen sonido."
1,incorrect description of product,"We will be returning this item. The description of product states that the player peices are shaped metal items, such as an ""oat bag"" and cute items like that. I called the manufacturer and they said that ""they have gone green, and are not shipping wooden barrels"". That is just silly, I think they have gone cheap.Too bad, could have been a nice game."
3,Not exactly what the picture shows,"This is a very good game with nice pictures of the horses and good info for horse loving children. For some reason, my version came with colored wooden tubes cut in half for game pieces instead of the cute silver horse themed shapes shown in the description. I was extremely dissappointed by this, especially since I didn't realize it until it was opened as a birthday present."
4,Horse-Opoly,"This was a birthday present for my horse-crazy niece, age 8. We played the game as soon as she opened it. The game lasted 4 hours... That was a bit long, but the kids had a great time. The second time around, they had figured out if you trade cards and get all of the same color, so you can put barns on the properties, the game goes more quickly. Overall, I would recommend this over some of the other versions of Monopoly (like the Barbie edition, for instance.) It does teach a bit about the different breeds of horses, and the costs associated with them!"
3,"Good, but not as described!","First thing you have to know is, that this DVD is a bootleg on a DVD-R.It is not color, it is not anamorphic, it is not AC3-coded, it has no menue!but ... it is - for a Beatle-Fan like me - a masterpiece!!!It has the whole Paris-, NME-, Blackpool- and Shindig!-performances in watchable picture- and good sound-quality.So, where else you can buy this on DVD?Greetings from Germany"
2,Two different gloves,"It is lucky that I do not need to wear these regularly, as they are obviously two different gloves. They are both of the same style, size, and color, but the left glove is made of textured leather and is nice, supple, and well fitted. The right glove is made of smooth leather, is much stiffer, is much thicker, and has awfully proportioned ring and pinkie fingers. The right glove also pinches the index finger badly when bent. My hands are the exact same size and shape, so I know the fault does not lie in them. I would give the left glove on its own four stars, the right only one. Luckily, they are really only for Halloween."
4,Don't stop it like on tv!,"my sister and i each got one for our brithday a few moths ago.i made the mistake of hlding the little ringer like on tv,and it brok.don't try stopping it like this!"
4,Travel in warrior world,"A real travel across the globe to be shwon very interesting techniques and grandmasters .The fights at the end of each episode are sometimes realistic ,some other times more choregraphed .The tall guy in it Bill Duff releis more on his weight than on his techniques and he's a bit ""soft"" that's to say he hurts himself or complain all the time ."
5,Marvelous!,"This is an extraordinary, near-perfect book. You have to read it for yourself. I am an English professor at the University of California Santa Cruz, and I can say I haven't read poems like this in a very long time. H.D. Elijah is so young and talented. I am thoroughly impressed."
1,Beware before You Buy,"I purchased this bulb based on the Product Description: ""GE, 45R20/SP/LL, 45W, Long Life Reflector Flood Bulb, Indoor R-20, Medium Base, 400 Lumens, 2500 Hours, Boxed, 25anddegree. Beam."" So I was surprised to open it and find, on the manufacturer's carton, that #47682 has a brightness of 310 lumens, not 400 lumens as described. That's almost 25% less brightness. Significant difference, not what I want, and it may not be what you want."
1,it only lasts for couple of months,"I bought two Toastmaster 6431 Eclipse single burners. The first one stopped working after 6 month without any reason. My second one stoped today. It has been only 4 month since I bought this. If i need another stove, I will not get this brand again."
2,Just why does it burn out??,"I've loved my little hotplate for 3 months, but it died. Froze the temp control at the time of death. Up until then I was very happy except for trying to boil large pots... never got there, and on frozen stirfry it has a hard time coming back after you add the frozen veggies... but ALL of the reviews are accurate, the high ratings just haven't used it enough times for it to burn out.. looks like anywhere from 50 to 100 uses, depending on how often you turn it all the way up. Highly recommended for a temporary use while on vacation or broken stove... now to try to get some warranty help!"
3,Thirteen months isn't long enough,"I purchesd Toastmaster 6431 Eclipse Single Burner last September. Out of the 400 days of ownership I used the Burner maybe 100 times. It worked well and I am most pleased with the appearence and the easy to use design, however it is now just lump of non working metal. It stoped working three days ago for no particular reason.If there is any kind of adjustment that can be made I would purchase this unit again. If there is no finacial consideration I will shop around and seek another brand.The benefits from owning this unit were, easy to clean, the hotfiliment is some sort of high tech plastic, and the warming area is large, simple heat control and easy to store."
3,outdated but useful,"this was the first extensive monograph of the lilac genus.if you are really into lilacs and want a complete collection then fine, spend the money and buy the book.the more recent publications by fr. fiala and f. vrugtman are far superior and far more readable.vrugtman's book is the best monograph of any genus that i have read."
1,Total Junk!,"I got this toaster as a gift, and it was broken in about one week. The spring is too weak (toast sinks back inside when it pops up), and the toast will not even stay down anymore (it will not latch at the bottom), so the thing doesn't even work now (about a week later). Pay a few bucks more and get a better toaster!"
1,not Great,"First of All I was abt to buy this product... but cancled my purchase as I found the same kind toaster with less price in the market..But same time I bought one kitchen utensils set.. and I am sorry to say it is just usable not good one like I they shown.. I saw many utensils set with same number of item atleast 500% times better than what I got,Second thing, I wanted to cancle the order immidiately but I tried to find out the customer care no on the amazon site.. but I could not find one :o((any way thats why I have decided not to buy from this site anymore...as now I can't rely on the pics only..."
1,It does burn!,"As someone stated above, this toaster does burn when used. I have to return it. Lots trouble!Do not even try it!"
4,Bright white light - great if you have a circle T9 fixture!,My local hardware store stopped stocking the circle t9 bulbs about two years ago - I know this because I bought the last two bulbs on clearance. I have six of these fixtures in my home and I finally needed another replacement bulb. Ordering on Amazon was easy and delivery fast. The bulb works great! It puts out a bright white light that lets me see my kitchen sink again.
4,READ THIS BEFORE BUYING....DRIVER INSTRUCTIONS FAULTY,"The driver installation instructions that come with this camera are WRONG! I had to contact the support center to get a completely different way to install the driver so I could download the pictures to my computer.This is my first digital camera, so I thought I was doing something wrong. Now that the driver is installed properly, I am happy with the camera's performance. Other than this, that is all the information I can give."
5,Steiner talks about the Black Lodge,"Well folks, here's a rarity you don't hear about very often...an anthroposophist speaking openly about the practices of secret cults, groups and societies of a negative nature!His words are still immensely relevent to our modern day predicament. If not more so, then back in the early 1900's.This series of lectures fills an important gap in Steiner's works/talks, but absolutely necessary for those serious in the esoteric to know about. Another good source who talks quite a bit on the black lodge is Samael Aun Weor."
2,Not AS Good As It Proclaimed,This DVD is nothing more than a guy on a motorcycle driving from spot A to spot B within a certain time frame..5 or 6 times....with a camera mounted on the front of the ride so you get a birdseye view of what it is like driving at almost 250 mph at times.If your a Motorcyle enthusiast...then this would be a good to have DVD...but if your wanting a movie...then dont get this for this is NOT a movie.But to be fair...it is something to check out if you have the need for speed and want to know what it s like riding like a bat out of hell..but it is not for me.i was extremely disappointed.
3,Filter doesn't last,"After we moved to a home with public water, our scalps were getting itchy. I purchased this and the itch went away. I was happy with delivery and we have been very happy with the purchase. But we've only had it for 2 months and we're already starting to itch again. This filter is supposed to last a year. I don't think I want to pay for a new filter so often. They're pretty expensive. I would have given this 5 STARS if it lasted as advertised...but I can't.Sincerely,Itchy and Disappointed"
5,"Small Book, Big Lessons","Sometimes, the best books to learn from are books of interviews with a master of some particular thing. This book is no exception and packs a lot of good info in a very few pages.The questions and answers that go back and forth between students and teacher reveal much and hint at even more.I return to this book every year or so and seem to find more in it at every read! (Always a good sign.)One of my favorite parts of the book is when Dr. Hatsumi says (paraphrasing from memory...) that no matter how strong a student becomes he must remember that nowadays anyone can be killed with a gun. A warrior who does not understand his own weakness ultimate faces doom more from himself than from others.Definitely worth reading multiple times."
5,Starting out,"This is the first book I ever read on the subject of Budo. It got me hooked. It's well written, playful and gives an interesting view of some of the first western students of Hatsumi-Sensei. You get a good down to earth connected feel when you finish the book. I did and it's kept me in gambatte mode through 10 years of training. I've lent this book out a lots had to buy new copies. It's well worth it.Highly recommended!"
2,not so realistic,"the book initself is not very helpful, its written in poetic kind of ways which makes it a little hard to grasp, i mean in this day and age its realy hard to imagine black hooded so called ninjas climbing onto rooftops and down chimneys, for historical value maybe the book can be good but if you want to follow the art its rather silly as there are other arts out there that doesnt need yoto climb trees and do the silent nija walk in a bush,,,"
1,Not as described in the description.,"While the Reveal line of light bulbs is fantastic, and I try to use them wherever I can in my home, I cannot endorse buying them from this seller. They clearly list a savings of 92% or $55.19 on these bulbs. I paid a total of $9.61 with free 2 day shipping from Prime and the addition of California Sales Tax.In the Product Specifications it says:Part Number 97784Item Package Quantity: 12Weight: 1.8 Pounds1.8 pounds is probably the weight of 12 bulbs, not the singe one that was shipped.I will gladly return this item and purchase from another seller that does not pull the Bait and Switch tactic used here."
3,TOASTMASTER TUV48 ULTRAVECTION OVEN,"HARD TO CLEAN AND MAKES MORE NOISE THAN OTHER COOKERS. THE FAN STARTED TO CREATE VIBRATION AND EVENTUALLY STALLED. OTHER THAN THE ABOVE, THE COOKER IS REALLY NICE. JUST THINK THAT IT SHOULD HAVE STOOD UP BETTER."
1,Avoid,"not real leather; not correct color as shown.This product may last you a couple of months.delivery, however, was fast."
4,Figuring out your culture attitude by answering questions,"Quite good book. Storti takes the majors contributions of the seminal authors as Hofstede, Trompenaars, Hall and others and puts theirs theories in useful exercises (questionnaires, dialogues, quotes, etc.) Well organized, this book is target to a personal expatriation experience usage. The book focus heavily on the most tangibles cultural patterns, such as the communication issues, using a non- cultural or social expert vocabulary. In consequence some readers will feel perhaps a tendency to over simplify the more complex social reality. But surely this approach was assumed by Storti who aimed to create a expatriation preparation toll to be use mostly by managers. Having in mid this goal this book is quite a good concretization. Its also a good starter in the challenging cross culture filed."
1,BEYOND TERRIBLE---,"If you like reading, ""his painful grasp bringing tears to her eyes,"" OVER and OVER and OVER then this book is for you. Sure, it's a mainstay in romance literature for the cool-headed brooding hero to lose himself in passionate agony every once in a while and physically restrain the heroine, BUT ON EVERY OTHER PAGE??? Where's the romance in that?This thing read like a really BAD Harlequin romance with WAY too much repetition. I also found the main characters unlikable because they never remained consistent--they were supposed to be hard and strong, but were basically weak and whiny. I thought I'd NEVER get through this book!"
4,Change of Pace!,I have purchased several birdhouse books and have been mostly disapointed with dull clunky outdated designs that are just down right ugly. This book is fresh air with fresh modern designs that are fun for the builder not just the bird! If you just want a birdhouse of clunky 1 inch stock painted in eyesore babyblue dont buy this book. This is a fun easy to build birdhouse book for the discriminating creative birdhouse builder.
3,Great Customer Service,"These lightbulbs are not packs of five. They are single bulbs. Do not buy this if you think you will be getting five bulbs for this price. However, when I wrote to complain the customer service was extremely prompt and resolved the issue immediately. I was very impressed with their ability to satisfactorily handle what would otherwise be a very disappointing sale."
3,Mind candy,"OK story. Great for us as snowbirds in Tucson and interested in our adopted state. Story is ... well, almost believable even in AZ where the unlikely becomes...likely."
3,Mixed feelings,IMHO not as good as the earlier works. Traditional Lakota Flute music mixed with the sounds of the world. Sometimes it works and sometimes not. Amazing Grace is definitely out of place. I wold stick to the older works of Tokeya Inajin.
1,Very scary!,"I ALSO purchased a Toastmaster with removable insert and it ALSO exploded the first time we used it! Glass shattered and flew all over the kitchen, while my daughter was standing in front of it waiting for her bagel to cook. Luckily she was not injured. I had planned to return it to Target for an exchange, but after reading the comments on this website, I will be purchasing another brand, even if it is more expensive.Thank you for your comments!debi nichols"
2,Pass on this oven,"I agree with the other reviewers - this oven does not work well. Toasting takes way too long. I have not had any fire problems, but I can see how it can happen because the shelf heights make it easy for food to touch the elements."
5,Amazing DVD!!!!,"This DVD is fun, shows amazing cars and show a lifetime experience race. It is really fun and exciting if you into cars and cannonball races. Reza is the man with his 360 Spyder... Keep doing your thing playa... Holla at your boy!!!!!!"
4,Good,"I like the small light weigh design. It can write properly, and do all of the proper things.Complaints:Eraser- This is the biggest drawback. The eraser is like a small thin, stick. It will wear out in a couple of days. Would have been better if it was bigger, and had a screw type function to get more eraser out.Led Guzzler: This leaves alot of unused lead leftover, so you have to throw out big chunks of lead, and load new ones.Appearance: The product isnt what it looks like on the main picture. Although it doesn't really matter for me."
3,Not necessary,"First of all, I am a HUGE fan of the Stitch 'n Bitch series of books. I love the way Debbie Stoller writes. However, this design journal doesn't seem to be written the same way and also I didn't find it extremely helpful or insightful if I were to design my own sweaters.There are some pages with graph paper to design graphics if you wanted to knit intarsia designs (or whatever) but the book itself is very small, and so the graph paper is very small and I'm thinking someone with fair to poor eyesight wouldn't be able to use that at all."
2,Poor Quality product,Within use of few days I noticed a leak. I believe it was because of the water pressure it started leaking. I ended up buying heavy-duty hose.
1,Wrong Item,"They promise the black one through out the order processing, however you get something else (Green color) bad material pipe.I wish i can get my Money back."
1,Leaks like crazy,I recieved a blue hose instead of a black one shown. This is the worst hose I ever purchased - leaks at spigot and the connection to sprayer.I do not recommend this hose.
3,Good Quality not Black,"Satified with the quality but as the picture indicated, I expected black hose. The actual color was green"
1,Hope You Don't Get The Green Hose!,"Needed a small light duty hose to hook up to my automatic sprinkler for my small garden in my backyard. Hose was exactly what I needed: small, light duty, cheap. Hooked it up to my sprinkler, set the timer to turn on and water twice a day and though everything was fine. The next day notice my garden is flooded. I take a look at the hose and it ruptured in the middle! Popped like a balloon from the water pressure I guess. The water pressure was not much at all as even a quarter turn of my spout would be too much for my little garden. I knew this thing was cheap and wouldn't hold up for any kind of job that put moderate stress on it, but this was the lightest of light duty jobs!Based on other reviews it sounds like the black hose has a better history of holding up but I had the green one and it was a bad buy. Thankfully Amazon stood behind their product and gave a full refund without any issues!"
4,So many uses...,"I got the Santa Fe Quesadilla maker and love it. When I saw this, I thought that it would be a great addition to my kitchen. It is! I like fajitas and this is great for that, but it also works as a buffet for parties, keeping foods warm during a meal, or you can even eat off of it when you're having a cozy dinner for 2. The uses for this are endless."
5,"Provactive, Beautiful, and my Thesis Topic",This fragmented narrative draws connections between the personal and political narratives of individuals and nations. It is by far one of the best books I've read.
5,very nifty!,"Love this thing! Great for keeping towels off the ground and holding little odds and ends (flashlights, extra batteries, etc.) Definitely for a larger tent. Make sure you don't load it down with too much weight, it'll cause the center of your tent to sag and possibly collapse!"
4,Great selection of songs with good accompaniments.,"This collection has many songs you haven't heard plus many of the ones you have (e.g. basically all the nursery rhymes). The pictures are cute, and the authors provide suggestions for actions to go along with some of the songs. We, and especially our two-year-old son, really enjoyed this book, so much so that we're going to buy it instead of re-re-renewing it from the library."
1,Self-indulgent rant,"Mintzberg may be one of the world's great management gurus, but he doesn't show it here.This book is exactly what it is billed to be---why Mintzberg hates the airlines.In particular, it is NOT why Mintzberg hates the airlines and what brilliant insights he has into how he would fix things.This is quite a disappointment, because, of course, to the extent that Mintzberg has a claim to fame, it's as a management guru, not a comedian. Moreover the airlines really do need some help from someone like Mintzberg.But because he's not a comedian, it's not a terribly funny book either (he tries hard, too hard), so it's not interesting on that score either.Any editor with sense would have told Mintzberg not to waste his time. Don't waste your time (or money)."
1,Not Funny,"I don't fly often. But I went ahead and read this book, expecting a short read that would offer a few chuckles. It ended up being very few indeed. Perhaps I chuckled twice and smiled two more times. He's just not that funny."
3,It's Not About Flying or Airlines,Henry Mintzberg has some things to say that a lot of people are not going to like.See his interview with David Creelman at HR.com where he takes some good shots at MBA's as well as management fad techniques.http://www.hr.com/HRcom/index.cfm/WeeklyMag/DEC88F25-3F2C-11D5-9AC1009027E0248F?ost=wmFeature
5,ABCs made beautiful,"The illustrations are wonderful, and the format is a lot of fun. My toddler loves it, and so do all the adults -- sad that the book appears to be out of print. Luckily, the author'sOh!is easy to get, and very highly recommended also."
4,Provides great lightweight protection!,"Had used this case extensively whilst snowboarding and it has been really great. Has provided protection for my Sony digital camera from all the bumps, and the semi-soft design is perfect on the odd tumble as you dont end up with a punctured lung from the case - yet the camera is still protected :)"
5,Very Nice Case,"I originally bought this case for my little Sony camera. Like others have mentioned, it's a little big. I had to come back and order another one, though, because my Kodak ZX1 (pocket camcorder) fit in it beautifully and I carry the extra batteries in the little battery/flash memory case that velcros to the carrying handle. Protects it so much better than the cloth bag that came with it. The price was WAY LOWER (less than $5) than it is today."
3,It is OK,"I received this item on time. I have tried it a couple of times at the house. I only use it with my daughter. I do not know if it withstand the drill at a Dojo. It should be good for a children to teenagers class, but it may not be strong enough for an adult class. I am only guessing. Then again for the price you cannot complain even if you have to bye a few of them."
5,Great CD - Better than Aaron's Party.,"If you liked Aaron Carter's previous album, Aaron's Party, you'll love this album. Even though there's no single as big as ""Aaron's Party"" this CD is better overall.My favorite track is ""Not Too Young, Not Too Old"" were I guess Aaron is saying that's he's the perfect age in his music business. I also love the songs ""I Would"" and ""Baby It's You"". The song ""I'm All About You"" is really sweet, and it's really the only song that Aaron sings and not raps on this album. If you like Aaron Carter or pop music in general, I recommend this album to you."
2,He has nothing on his brother!,Aaron take a hint you can't rap!!!!! I hate a cd where the singer thinks he can sing but really can't! In this case Aaron cater the only song listing to on this is cd is not to young and not to old only because nick cater is in it!!! really Aaron cater can't really rap but he has good vocals. so over all if your like me and just bought the cd cause he is a brother to nick hottie carter well then just try to block out when Aaron tries to rap! i mean come on jaz-y can put it down for god sackes just sing pop Aaron!! BSB ROCKS!
5,Doing Gender,I ordered this book for a course I am taking. The approach to gender as something we DO everyday is especially enlightening. The authors' upfront revelation of not claiming to be objective is especially refreshing. The text is packed with information about gendering acts and how to be aware of our programming to become part of the heterosexual marketplace.
3,Excellent for home use or for kids - dojo use can be punishing,"We use these pads on a daily basis at a Kung Fu club. When the pads are new, they do a good job at absorbing the impact, even from heavy adult kickers. However, these pads seemed to break down quickly, and when they do, they are absolutely punishing for the person holding the bag.I believe the bags would be great for home use (even for adults) and for kids. However, if you are buying these pads for club/dojo/daily use, for adults, then be prepared to replace them relatively regularly."
3,"The part is ok, the design is poor.","Once you have, it installed it work fine. The trouble is you end up carrying several additional items around with your compact, easy to carry, digital camera. Looking back the camera is great! However, it lacks the ability for easy lens changes. To compensate Sony came up with this add-on. The add-on takes a couple of minutes to install, and then you have to screw the lens onto the adaptor. If you are switching from a long shot to a close shot, you spend a lot of time installing and removing the adaptor and lenses. If I had, it to do over again I would buy a 35mm digital where the lenses are easer to change and you do not need an adaptor."
5,good,this little wonder will take the chill off in the room it seems to have no moving parts its very small but does a good job I got mine here used and in the off season like June July way cheaper that way and yup I live in a very cold state Pennsylvaniait works very nice
4,Good heater for under desk,"This heater is perfect for under your desk. Only 300W so it doesn't trip the breakers. This heater won't ""cook"" your legs like some will. Do keep it 1-2 feet away from things. I had it sitting on a stool under my desk w/ about 8"" above the heater and the top of my desk started getting hot. Even sitting directly on the floor, the underside of my desk right above the heater gets pretty warm. No fan means the heat doesn't get blown out, it just rises and collects under the desk. But it is nice and quiet so the building people aren't complaining about my ""heater"" - they don't even know it is there... This would not be a good room heater unless it was a very small room and you stay right in front of it. Overall a good cheap heater."
2,"Worked great for a while, then stopped working","I bought my heater to keep under my desk at work. I loved it while it worked, then about 4 months after I bought it, it just stopped working! Then switch says its on, but the coils no longer heat up. My return window expired, so I am stuck with a broken heater!"
1,Horrible,"I liked it at first, because it was so quiet and small, but in the end the heating area was tiny (use it if you like warming only one part of one side of your body). And it died on the second day! Completely disappointed."
2,Dish Heater,"Doesn't really put out as much heat as I expected. I thought this was a deal for 20 bucks, but after purchasing it I found one at a local store for 24 dollars that had twice the number of heating coils, had different settings, and oscillates."
2,Not that useful,19.99 is a good deal but the bad thing is that it does not work for even a small room. You have to have it really close to yourself to feel the heat.
1,"Weak heat, melted parts","In general, I love parabolic heaters because they can warm you up while burning relatively few watts. This one, however, is just too low power to be useful. In spite of the low power, the plastic medallion in the center of the grille began to melt after a few minutes (I noticed the part nearest the heating element getting soft and drooping). In my opinion, this is a potential fire hazard. Also, the tilt switch safety feature doesn't work on carpet (maybe an extra safety feature?)."
4,Optimus heater,"Got what I wanted, a light heater that doesn't blow. However, it tend to beam down and not too stable."
2,the heater is to small,oh well i thougth was bigger but its to small its ok 4 the restroom but not 4 my bedroom
1,I do not recommend this item,"I ordered this item and it arrived broken. It was properly packaged with no damage to the box, yet the heater was damaged (smashed into pieces) and then packaged into the box and sent out."
2,THESE HEATER'S BROKE IN LESS THAN 3 MONTHS OF USE!!!,"NOW I BOUGHT 5 OF THESE 300 WATT HEATERS IN OCTOBER OF 2011. IT IS NOW MARCH 2012 AND ONLY 2 OF THE 5 HEATERS ARE STILL WORKING, THE FUSE OR SOMETHING INSIDE THE HEATER BLOWS OUT AND EVENTUALLY THE ONLY THING YOU CAN GET TO WORK IS THE LITTLE ORANGE SWITCH USED TO TURN THE HEATER ON!BUT I WON'T SAY ALL THE OPTIMUS HEATERS ARE BAD, I BOUGHT THE 600/800 WATT OPTIMUS HEATERS WHICH COST AROUND $4O AND BOTH OF THOSE HEATERS STILL WORK.ALL I CAN SAY IS DON'T TRY TO USE THESE HEATERS FOR ANY EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME OR THEY WILL BREAK! BUT I USED THE 600/800 WATT HEATERS ALL WINTER LONG AND THEIR STILL WORKING. SO I SUGGEST GETTING THE $40 600/800 WATT OPTIMUS HEATERS AND NOT THESE ONES FOR SERIOUS HEATING."
5,Optimus dish heater,"I really satisfied to my dish heater, i have no regret of buying this. It doesn't stop or pause, some they do.I recommend this for those who want to buy heater.Your not going to waste your money, i love it."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!,Used it once and it never worked again. And couldnt find the original box so I just put it out in the garage.This product is CRAP! Dont waste your money...
1,A toaster produces more heat than this thing!,To small to week even for the smallest of spaces. False advertisement again! Waste of space!Optimus H-4110 9-Inch Dish HeaterIt may be good for a pretend house for children or a local yard sale. Maybe also for the recycling yard. But then again Amazon has a great return policy.
3,Only heat up a very small area,"I have to put this very close in order to feel nice and toasty. I use this to warm my feet and I had to put my feet within 2-3 feet of the heater. I like it on the warm side though, so your milage may varies."
4,Well made quality product,It is very well made and very attractive. Putting keys onto the rings is very easy due to the thoughtful design
1,Wake CD/DVD George Groban,"I was very disappointed after receiving the CD/DVD set from George Groban / AWAKE for a price of $ 24.99. The DVD is not the DVD I was expecting, it was just a behind the scene of making the Music Video DVD and NOT the MUSIC VIDEO itself! Amazon should have inform this to the buyers with the sale of the CD/DVD on the web."
2,sad,"I did not recieve the special edition sighhhhhhhh it was not a good format, IF I got the special edition it properly have been a better format..."
4,Awake review,"Although I do not find this as spectacular as Closer, I still enjoy this CD very much. I do think Josh is at his best singing the operetic songs, but this shows a versitility that can still be appreciated and enjoyed. I just enjoy listening to Josh's voice with all its richness and passion."
4,Finally,"3 years has it been? I fell in ♥ with the music of Josh Groban when I first heard him on PBS. I was like 12 or something and he's been my favorite singer since that very day. I've been waiting for this new album for 3 yrs. and it's finally here!!! His voice is unlike anything I've ever heard before and this album is as great as the last two. My favortie song is ""You are loved"". I agree with everyone else, Josh needs to put out a Christmas album sometime."
3,Summer on Wheels,Would you like to go for an adventure with your best friend? This book is about Mando and Hector going on an adventure and visiting their family. They fall in a TV commercial. They walk and see a tomboy and more.I recommend this book to kids who like to read a lot. I also recommend this book to kids that read English and Spanish. I hope you like it.
1,summer on wheels,"Have you ever gone on a bike trip and had fun? Well, this book is so boring you will fall asleep . because it has no excitement ,and has no point to it . A good has a problem, a solution and a climax and this book didn't I don't recommend this book for any age or any body that dosen't speak spanlish because this book has spanlish word.So don't read this book."
1,Waste of money!,This cooker was disappointing from the day we bought it - the lid didn't sit well so it emitted steam all over the kitchen counter. The rice always burnt and stuck to the bottom (which never happened with our Black and Decker one) and it stopped working just over a month after we bought it!!
1,BURNS RICE EVERY TIME,"TOTAL piece of useless junk! Looks nice and build well, BUT the bottom line, as another reviewer already pointed out, it burns the rice every time no matter what kind of rice you use or what method you use to cook it. I assume anyone buying a rice cooker is looking to cook rice, not BURN it. So if you are planning on using this for cooking rice, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME & MONEY WITH THIS ONE!!!"
1,A real piece of junk!,"I recently bought this Faberware Rice cooker on the notion that it looked to be superior construction and quality. Plus for the price, you'd think it could at least cook a decent pot of rice. Guess again. Despite how careful you are, the rice is either soggy or burnt! Plus the manufacture has calibrated their cooker to use their ""Cup"" of measurement which has no bearing to real world measurements (Closer to 3/4 cup) Not the end of the world, but frustrating to use with our recipes. Overall a real disappointment. Stay away - stay far far away!"
5,Works Like It Should,"These have always been one of my favorite 3-ways.A nice 30 watt low setting for ambiance.Then, depending on your eyes, 70/100 makes a good choice.Always liked the nice warm glow these bulbs produce."
2,very so-so imitation of Sergio Mendes & Brasil '66,"Gimmicks was a Sergio Mendes & Brasil '66 cover band from Sweden. Their first album was in Swedish, their second album (this one) was the same tracks rerecorded in English. The track list (as listed on the CD) is:1. The Joker2. Walk On By3. California My Way4. Look Of Love5. Constant Rain (Chove Chuva)6. Boink (Brazil de Carnival)7. Bom Bom Bay8. Going Out Of My Head9. Look Around10. Dance The Samba11. You're My World12. RodaAs you can see, only some of the tracks are one that Brasil '66 did. (This is somewhat analogous to the way Tijuana Brass cover groups like the Mexicali Brass did their albums.)But in my opinion, since the group has lackluster arrangements and performances compared to Brasil '66, it's not even worth a high import price to hear these other tracks ""as they might have sounded"" had Brasil '66 done them. Better to spend your money on real Brasil '66 albums and/or actual Brasilian artists."
4,Wit of Yesteryear,"""The Kennedy Wit"" is an entertaining collection of witty statements by JFK. Organized into four sections: The 1960 Campaign; The Presidency; The Family; and Press Conferences, all interspersed with dozens of pictures, its jokes and zingers still work. It is short and delightful. Read and enjoy!"
1,Thank God For The Fast Forward Button,"If you want to see the same footage of the same 3 bikes doing the same stunts over and over on the same air strip, with some bad skits with police mixed in, this video is for you.If you are wanting hardcore street stunts, dont buy it."
4,Stories from theTrenches,I got the book mainly for the chapter on Walgreens since I work for the company. I found it extrememly interesting and informative. It really showed how good mgrs work and think. I am reading the rest of the book now and finding the same kind of examples.
4,The One Thing You Need To Know Is... Read This Book!,"Buckingham has taken an over documented topic and provided a fresh new approach to management & leadership. He explains in unique detail the difference between a manager and a leader (which I always thought were one in the same). The added benefit to this book is the third piece on ""Individual Sustained Success"" which is simply - simple! I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a tool to help them become a better leader or a more respected manager."
2,"A ""Cliff's Notes"" of previous books!","I am not sure why this book was written, except maybe, the author wanted to add another title to his published works. This book is basically comprised of briefs from various chapters of the author's two previous books (which were very good, by the way). If you have read his two previous books and/or you are a seasoned manager, the book is repetetive and boring. The author gives many examples of real life scenarios but the stories go on and on for pages. A good book to read if you can't fall asleep"
1,a pair of tail lights at best,"I can't believe all the positive reviews. The lights are so small and weak, they cannot not be used to illuminate the path."
1,Not What I thought,These items are so small they might work for a trike but not small 2 wheeler. Very disappointed. The size should be made clearer.
3,"It's nice, but the white one came not working...","I like how practical this lights are, just wish I didn't have to go through the hassle of returning and exchanging. I don't know how long they last, if the exchanged pairs work fine for a long time, I'd change my rating."
4,planet bike blinky safety light,Excellent value! Wouldn't buy it specifically for illuminating the road but you do get some visibility with it.
3,Itty bitty lights,"These lights are a very good price. They are small, single LED, elongated ping pong ball sized. If you are the real deal, riding with the big boys, claim your lane, street cyclist, these small lights probably are not sufficient to keep you safely in view. These days I ride primarily on rural roads, sidewalks and bike paths so I just wanted lights so I would be considered street legal. These fit my purpose, but I make sure I am way over if I hear a car coming."
3,"Definitely a ""K.I.L."" item",K.I.L. is Keep It Legal. That's pretty much what these lights do for me as a I ride at night. The buttons are small and hard to reach when I want to change them (even when I'm not riding). The front light should have a hood or shroud or something to keep the light it emits front shining back into my face.Pros: They are easy take off and small enough to fit in a bag when parked.
3,"auxiliary blinkers, at best","These are auxiliary blinkers, at best, which is fine, but you should have a real headlight on your bike like my favorite, the NowAdvisorQ5 CREE 240 Lumen LED Torch. I will attach these as additional lights to BE seen, but not for illumination.I also think they are pretty flimsy, and a bit more money that they should be."
4,Can't beat the price,"I use these lights for riding at night. I use the white light on the blinking setting on the front, just for visibility--it's not bright enough to act as an actual headlight. The red light isn't bright enough for me to feel safe using it on its own. I put it on my bag, and have a brighter light (Planet Bike Blinky ""7"" 7-Led Rear Bicycle Light) attached to my bike. With both of them on the blinking setting, I feel sufficiently visible to cars."
5,Quick Clip On Lamps,"I use these when I'm coming off mountain bike trails at dusk. Nothing worse than coming up on someone stopped or someone that wrecked without warning.. and this keeps both parties safe. They weigh next to nothing, so I keep them in my pack till it starts getting dark.. then I pull them out and clip them onto my jersey, helmet, or bike. It only takes seconds and really makes you noticeable. Nothing gets the adrenaline going like some fast DH at dusk or dawn!Same concept works for road riding even in the day. They are bright enough to get someones attention in daylight and at night.. not the best but serve the purpose for that."
2,great concept poor constuction,"Great concept but after a few uses it does not perform correctly.sugar gets stuck on the side and avoids the correct measurement to come out.Very cheap look, but so cool the first few times you use it before the sugar gets stuck and messes it up"
1,Sugar Please Doesn't Please,"This poorly made piece of junk conked on me after about a year's use. It was also clunky to use, with a hard-to-press button trigger that dispensed differing quantities of sugar, plus a funnel that stows in the bottom and would often fall into my cup of coffee. Save your money -- NOT recommended."
2,Less Than Happy!,"I find the inconsistency of the cooked waffles very frustrating. The preheat light seems to be of little value. I frequently have to use a fork, even when using Pam to lightly ""grease"" the griddle. More often than not the waffles are overcooked and pull apart when I lift the lid. I plan to purchase a different waffle iron. Good luck!"
1,Not Full of Hot Air,"When my old air popcorn popper died, my husband surprised me with the Toastmaster Air Popper. What a disappointment! It seems that the air pressure is not strong enough to push the popcorn over into your bowl, which leaves you with burnt popcorn and unpopped corn in the chamber."
1,Disappointment!,On top of the previous negative reviews I want to add that many of the kernels fly out of the popper unpopped. They are extremely hot and bounce of the bottom of the bowl right into my face at a great speed. Don't try it with the children around. Pop corn tastes dry and has no flavor. It's also not very stable and tips over easily. (Makes good air heater though).
4,Still Saving Horses and Riding Cowboys,"I admit I bought Horse of a Different Color because of Save a Horse, Ride a Cowboy...but these guys are just different and fun. I'm proud to say I'm an owner of the T-shirt as well! I love driving my hubby nuts with their music. He's one of those people who think all music should have nice lil genre labels and he has no friggin clue what to call them! This CD is worth the price, it's great! A fun followup to first one!"
5,One of my favorites,"Big & Rich, like Toby Keith, have that great country rock sound along with a great sense of humor. Great album"
1,poor quality,"after using it for five weeks, one of them got broken. don't know how long shall another one work. disappointed"
3,Holst Was a Great Composer,"I am upset that someone said ""Holst was not a genius like Bach."" Holst was one of incredibly few people who could make his living on his composing alone for so long. He was one of the greatest composers. I am also upset that someone said it is a pity he is not well known. He is well known enough. It is merely that people do not recognize something great when they see it. I pity both of the people who had the gut to say such atrocious things."
3,toaster,honestly i hate it. did arrive on time. i'm just waiting for it to burn out so i can buy a new one.
5,Matthew...Tell Me About Heaven,"Who would have thought, we still can continue to live our passions without any negative aspects after our physical bodies? Just enjoy our being and the same time be with our loved fellows. I call it perfect life indeed. I find it amusing to know that we also continue our learning on the other side. After reading the book, I thought, ""well then, bring it on, when is my turn to go back?"" I used to fear death and everyone I know were infused the same FEAR. Now, I appreciate physical Earth life more than ever and so I'm in peace to go back HOME.May"
4,It works,"It works, and it's clearly built to last a lifetime.My only minor gripe is that it was apparently designed in a time when people weren't quite so tall as they are today. There's still a certain amount of bending over, or at least stooping."
1,Cheap cheap cheap,"Once locked no one could figure out how to unlock it, so we pulled the lock off. It came off really easy. Pried off with a kitchen butter knife. The box worked fine lockless, so we pulled the locks off the other ones we had as well.-jim lee"
1,Very poor quality,"We received this player as a family gift for Christmas. As the first reviewer noted, the microphone that is included has very poor quality. The screen is very hard to read and the camera is poor quality as well. I would not recommend you spending the money on this product."
1,Superficial commercial treatment of complex issues,"This is a book by another ""specialist"" on the Middle East that would appeal to the common denominator reader. In an attempt to cover a wide scope of countries and issues and histories, Roger Owen, a well-respected authority in the subject matter, churns out a shallow text that does not even start getting to the issues at hand. It is a dull read that follows a standard template for what a professor believes should be fed to undergraduate students.Professor Owen dwells in 280 pages on state building and political parties and movements, but lacks insight into events at the beginning of the 20th century that contradict his conclusions. I would not recommend this book for serious readers of Middle East issues or history, but it is useful for those under duress to produce a term paper at college."
1,Doesn't fit T39m.,Not much to say here.. it simply doesn't latch properly onto the phone. Poor tolerances on the battery plastic shell. Maybe I received an unusual sample....
5,AMAZING,its an amazing movie. its one of very few wrestling movies. i can relate cuz i wrestle highschool right now. matthew modine ( full metal jacket : pvt joker ) does amazing as this character!!!
2,"Just a tool for review, does not teach you",I bought this and the Exam carm series book for this test and the Exam cram book is ten times better. This book assumes you already or once new everything and just tries to help you review.
3,CLASSIC PATTERSON,"EARLY WORKS BY THIS AUTHOR JUMP AROUND TOO MUCH - BUT HE ALWAYS HAS THE BEST TWISTS AND TURNS. IF YOU LIKE PATTERSON AT ALL, CONTINUE TO PICK UP HIS LATEST WORKS. THE INTELLIGENT READER'S JOHN GRISHAM!"
1,Don't bother with this one,"I purchased this toaster because it touts the widest and deepest bread slots of any toaster. They're deep, which is fine, but the slot bottom is a wavy piece of wire that has big gaps. Pop Tarts (for which there is a special setting) lean way over to the side and get trapped when the pop-up mechanism activates. (Bread does this sometimes too if the pieces aren't very large.) Items don't pop up as far as the outside of the box tells you it does. Still have to stick fingers or tongs in to get items. Also, the darkest setting for making toast is not actually all that dark. Toast comes out unevenly browned. The levers to push the bread down don't always catch the first time, so you have to make sure the bread actually stays down. I had this for 3 weeks before taking it back. What a disappointment!"
1,Worst toaster I've ever had!,"This is undoubtedly the worst toaster in the world. I've had it for several months now and I'm getting rid of it. That's why I'm at Amazon today-to buy another one. The toast sticks, bagels get stuck, toast does not brown evenly. A total waste of your money."
4,"Nice information, a little complicated","This book is much thiner than I expected. There are several good plans for bat houses and several variations one can make to those plans. There is also recomended variations for various bat types. In addition there is a fine history on the making of bat houses and bat conservation. My only complaint about this book is that the plans are a bit complicated. I like lego style plans, where each page has a simple set of instructions that is advanced by the next page. Each of the plans in the book is 1-2 pages. This is great for people who are used to carpentry plans for for the average person like me it means a little more thinking.ProsDetailed plans, with variationsGood history of bat conservationConsPlans fairly complicatedBook very thin for the money"
1,Leveraing a Lottery review,"This book not worth buying. It has no index and its discussion of probability in the first 27 pages does not use standard notation and is better explained in two or three pages of a college algebra text. The remaining pages appear to be of no help in winning a lottery, but do contain a glossary of the author's altered definition of standard mathematical and programming terms."
2,"A Little Time in Texas, the bus should not have stopped","Ms.Johnston did not spend time making her characters have depth. They were flat with a few hormones. I was truly disappointed. I felt like someone with a word processer and spell check, but no editor was at it again."
2,Would not recommend,I purchased these as a Christmas gift for my daughter. They take way too long to heat up and the clips leave a crimp mark in her hair. For the money I don't think they were worth it.
1,remington hot rollers,"I am not satisfied with my Remington Hot Rollers. They do not get hot enough. Also, it appears that ""ions"" are the big buzz word in hair curling products. The ion part of the product makes my hair much too soft. That means they do not provide body for my hair. It is difficult to find a hair product that does not have ions as part of the product. So, what is a person supposed to do? I am sure I am not the only one with fine, straight hair. Perms damage my hair too much!Remington, please, please consider bringing back a hot roller product that has all or mostly small hot rollers without the ions. The reason I had to purchase new hot rollers is because my ""Remington Tightcurls"" finally gave out and quit working. I had them for years and they finally quit working. They were all the same size (small) and I loved them.Sincerely,Kristine Wright4941 Memphis Ct.Hilliard OH 43123USA"
1,Not recommended,"Having heard about hoodia, I bought this product from a local health food store, and used it to make tea everyday until it was gone. Unfortunately, it never diminished my appetite, which is what one would probably expect it to do since it boasts having hoodia in it. I emptied the tea bags and there's only a tiny bit of powder in this that isn't tea leaves, which I'm guessing must have been the hoodia. But if there's really hoodia gordonii in this (gordonii being one of several types of hoodia, and the only type with the appetite-supressant properties), it doesn't seem to be enough to actually do anything."
3,Mainly for Esperantists,"I have to admit that I bought this mainly because of the dialogue in Esperanto. Although I would not call myself an Esperantist, I know the language quite well and take a general interest in constructed languages, and I think Esperantists are far too critical of this movie. Sure, a lot of the dialogue is poorly pronounced, but William Shatner and one or two others manage the language quite well, and I cannot understand why a dedicated Esperantist would not at least want the movie in his collection. As fantasy-horror, it is passable, and shows some imaginative camera work, and is of reasonable picture quality, considering its age."
1,What on earth?,"From all the hype I would have thought this movie the equal of Night of the Living Dead in terms of cinematography and dramatic tension, with the added attraction of the movie being in Esperanto, which I speak, read and write. Boy, was I taken hook, line, and sinker!This was the most painful 76 minutes I've ever spent in front of my television. Incubus was just plain awful. From the wooden acting, to the music which attempted to be atmospheric but was simply annoying, to the lame plot, and on to the dreadfully pronounced Esperanto. This may be a cult classic but I can't figure out why.Spare yourself."
5,A Punk Rock Western? That's An Original Idea!!!!,"This movie is about 3 young guys who are jaded by New York Life and decide to head to California in the hope of a better life. Along the way they are accostd by a group of thugs and one of them is killed. Not getting any help from the authorities John Cryer decides to track down these cutthroats himself together with his friend named 'Biscuit"". They are aided in this attempt by Catherine Mary Stewward who plays Cryer's Love Interest. What a lucky guy!!!It is not often that you see a punk rock Western movie. This movie has glorious vistas shot in Wyoming and a very likeable cast and I suspect that it just might be a ""Cult Classic"" given time. I hope so."
3,My dogs LOVE these!!,"These are great treats and my dogs go nuts for them, however you hardly get anything in the bag for the price. If you got more for your money I would buy it again, but it's too much for what you get!!"
5,Monstrous Fun!,"The Boo-opoly game is one our grandkids love to play as Halloween approaches. We bought the game last year along with theI Spy Spooky Night Search and Find Bookas Halloween entertainment. They like creeping around the board trying to collect enough Haunted Houses to be able to trade them for a Full Moon Hotel. Winning a pumpkin carving contest is a treat while having to pay Fright Fees and having Bats in your Belfry are tricks nobody wants to win. In a kid's Trick or Treat world both the game and the book are definitely 'enjoyable treats' and, surprisingly, 'monstrously entertaining' for all ages. ~ Mrs. B"
4,An excellent overview of finance to 1998,"For obvious reasons i.e. ""how did we get into this mess"", the origins of finance have come under scrutiny. This book provides an excellent historical perspective. It is not a heavy mathematical read, but more of a historic narrative, written from the perspective of an expert market practitioner. It leaves off in the late 1990's and therefore does not include the more recent excesses, but is a very good overview of the key developments that is well worth reading, even if you disagree with the direction finance has taken, it is useful to know how it got there."
2,"Mildly interesting theory, useless practice","I was hoping to get a better understanding of theories that have driven historical stock market performance. Unfortunately, I felt this book fell short. He explains several academic theories for portfolio selection, which was theoretically interesting. Most of them were pretty useless to me to help with stock selection. One academic said the longrun return you can expect in the stock market is 0%; get real. Actually using these theories is basically impossible. For a better academic understanding of the market, I'd highly recommend A Random Walk Down Wall Street. I started buying Vanguard 500 after reading that one."
2,not much here,"All of what this book says could have been said in 5 or 6 pages. There are a few basic concepts the book covers that are worthwhile, but I found it to be heavily padded and very basic. A much better book is Profores' Film Directing Fundamentals, which comes at storyboarding and other visualization tools from a director's viewpoint, rather than an illustrator's."
4,Freda Payne Greatest Hits,Freda Payne was one of the best Dance songstress around next to Gloria Gaynor. She later dropped off the scene and arose again do opera. This CD does contain some of her greatest hits but I would recommend buying one of the foreign recordings.
5,Great toy,"Got my kids the Thing hands and Feet. Thee love them. Goes great with the Halloween Thing costum.Great toy, great value."
2,"Compact, But the Rollers Fall Easily","I bought this set directly from the manufacturer. I have the previous old set that I've gone back to using because the rollers are far easier to put in place and they stay in place. I do sometimes get the crimped look on top with the old set, but I go to war with the new set. I have been using this new set for two months and used it on a month's vacation. I had high hopes it would work well because I loved my old set and it is compact. It was a battle to keep the rollers in place. They are too heavy, the pins don't stay in place easily. If you have short or thin hair, they want to fall out."
2,Horrible,"There was no character development in this book's heroine and she wasn't even likeable to begin with. Her life revolves around sex and alcohol, alcohol and sex. You don't find yourself rooting for her that she'll find Mr. Right. I enjoyed one character in this book- Leo. Nothing in this book was worthwhile - all the characters are constantly drinking, going to parties, and having sex. One wishes they would find something more worthwhile to do."
5,"Sorry Kindle, LOA is here to stay!","While browsing through the Amazon Faulkner's offering, I noticed a little tag that urges the candidate reader to suggest the publisher to have this title available on Kindle. This ""advertisement"" could not be more misplaced! The Library of America in general, and the Faulkner volumes in particular, are the reason why Kindle will not go beyond a niche market. You simply cannot beat the pleasure of owning (or even borrowing, albeit it's not the same!) these volumes, the joy of having an immortal text for your progeny, the pride of having read an incredibly complex yet life-changing book (The Sound and the Fury in this case). And how becoming and appropriate that the title comes from Shakespeare, for this is the best writing after the Bard!How can the world be a bad place if people like Faulkner lived here? The only problem with these volumes is that the short stories have not been included in a 6th volume. But asking for more than perfection goes overboard! to"
1,this listing is for an American band,"I ordered what I thought was a Norwegian band's album, and the album received, as pictured, is a different band, from America."
3,Not a good text book,"I bought this book because my CHIN 318 class was using it as our textbook. It is a really confusing book to learn and study from. If my professor had not put up the translations and text online, I would not have been able to make heads or tails of what the texts said because it had little room for me to write notes or vocab definitions for the characters."
5,Balance of Miracle and Death,"What a fantastic book! This entire series is outstanding, but this one is the best yet. The O'Malley family struggles with the fallout from a school shooting. Weaving into that story is Jennifer suffering in her last stages of cancer. The family faces the most difficult situation of praying for God to work a miracle as well as praying for a peaceful end. You'll find a master in Dee Henderson."
2,Doesn't fit everyone,This is a little tight on the person for whom I purchased it for. He has not worn it yet.
1,"I agree, it HURTS!","The first time I tried it under my arms, it chafed my skin, turned it red and burned. Second time same thing. I could barely move my arms the entire day. Thought it did okay on the legs but I want a shaver that does both - well. Took it back. Save your money."
1,"poor design, waste of money","This is a poorly designed lemonade maker. The plastic construction is flimsy.When you apply pressure to juice the lemon, you feel like the plastic is going to crack.Making lemonade should be an easy, enjoyable process. But this machine makes it a lot more trouble than it has to be. You have to put sugar in a separate reserve, add water into another reserve, and the steam comes out of the top, so it can get kind of hot. Because the water is heated to melt the sugar, you'll have to use ALOT of ice to cool it down in order to drink. Then you have to disassemble the top to wash out the sugar, pulp & seeds.I cannot believe Salton released this product to be sold. It is a completely unnecessary contraption. I would recommend buying a simple, smaller juice extractor for squeezing the lemons instead. You can melt sugar with hot water in a separate cup and just add cold water. Trust me, it'll save u money, time and counter space!"
2,Too hard to use as described,Was intrigued by this product so bought one.Pros -Great citrus juice extractor. Strong Motor.Cons -Extractor tray is too shallow and fills up with pulp quite fast.following instructions to use number of lemons the sugar required is far greater than it can use/handle.Not all sugar is used and some is left in bottom of container after water has gone thru.The hot water passing thru tray to sugar to make the simple syrup is totally unnecessary.The number of lemons siggested makes the lemonade far too strong especially with the amount of sugar required.The pouring spout on the pitcher puts more on the outside of the glass than inside.It is far more complicated than it needs to be.
3,Add Vertical Interest to Your Model Railroad,"To us, windmills look ""quaint,"" but for centuries farms used windmills to pump needed water for the livestock and irrigation. For several decades, some farms even used them to provide electricity (my grandpa's farm for one). This windmill will fit almost anywhere, and the haywagon and plows that come with it will provide the kind of ""clutter"" you see around any working farm's barnyard. The guy on the tractor is too toylike to use without some serious painting, though. Also the jeep is pretty cheesy. But there's no reason not to leave the wheels off the pickup, hit it with rust primer, and leave it in a field somewhere for a little more ""local color."" - Paul Race, editor, Big Christmast Trains"
3,Wrong Scale,"This item along with similar farm scene items was selected under HO scale yet arrived as O scale. However, I will be receiving a refund for this item and I am not required to return. That is great service."
5,Give yourself a present every day!!!,"Pure and simple, this comic starts my day off with a smile. My favorite strip was Bucky singing in the shower..."
3,I did not realise the DVD was region 1 and not region 4,"Lucky ,it turns out our 2nd dvd player will play both region 1 and region 4,this was more good luck than good management."
5,Great for a very spiritual person,"This book is great for a very spiritual person. The book is really basic, but at the same time if your in a higher level it review some details that sometimes we forget."
3,"ok product, but not the best","Product is rated for 10 lbs, but consider the just under 10 inch width of the spit - anything larger than that is impossible to fit.I have at various times cooked 2 cornish game hens, one chicken, or one small duckling. Forget the small turkey, and forget 2 whole chickens - that WILL NOT FIT.Also, grease does not really drip off very well due to the horizontal rotation - some grease rolls back onto the food. I think a vertical rotisserie is better if one is concerned about grease."
4,Witty and suspensful,"For a B-movie, this possesses a great deal of verbal humor and imagination. Very good performances by Jerry Doyle and Stacey Williams elevate it far above bigger budget films of its type."
4,Walgreens sells for less,"I was in Walgreens this evening and saw what appears to be this exact shaver for $.... Either way, for the money, it should be a good value. This shaver has the same 3 TCT ""technology"" and ALL THE SAME FEATURES but for less money. I have been using another Remington model for the past 5 years or so and it has performed very well for me. I lost my cord and decided I needed a new shaver, since stores and internet that I have seen, don't seem to sell the recharger cord only. My only complaint is that the microscreens tear if knocked around (by a small child or what ever). They will tear up your face if not replaced quickly. They are quite expensive to replace (Around $... if I recall @ Walgreens, but that also includes new, sharp replacement blades for the shaver. Who knows? Maybe they can be found for less on the web."
1,Dead razors,"I bought two Remington razors just over 2 years ago, one for me and one for my dad. They were different models, but were both over $100.Sadly, they both died within the past month. It can't be a coincidence. I can't get them to work even while plugged in. Now I'm stuck with having to buy two more shavers. I assure you it won't be a Remington."
1,"Not so ""Ultimate"" guide to live sound","I am a professional sound engineer and have been for over 15 years. I am also an audio educator specifically in the fields of live sound and studio engineering. I bought this DVD with the hopes of showing to one of my live sound classes. I must say, this is the most disapointing video I have ever seen. It was vague, undetailed, incomplete and useless to all but the most naive band memeber. There are fudumantal concepts left out like mains power, crossover setup, load in/load out/ recording, ect... The ""instuctor"" keeps saying ""just do it untill it sounds good"" instead of explaining. This DVD rushes through concepts to keep the running time under 60mins. I would never use this in a class as educational material- ever. If you want a video that is more complete - check out Live Sound Reinforcement."
4,"Small, but works","These are just very basic headbands. They work great. They're thick enough to soak up plenty of sweat. However, they're quite small. If you have a smaller head, they're probably perfect in every way. But for me, since I have a big head, they're usually pretty tight. But a headband isn't really going to cut off my brain circulation, so I can forgive that fact."
4,I thought it would last..............,"I bought this model 2 years ago, and I was happy with it. I only used it dry, because if I wanted to shave in the tub, I'd just use a razor. It did a good job: close enough without being TOO close. But I went to use it the other day and even though it had been charging for a couple of days, it just didn't work! Instead of going Rrrrrrrrr, it went click,click,click,click.........For the price, I thought it would last longer than 2 years.Other than being short lived, I really liked it. I would buy one again."
4,"Encouragement from ""The Sound of the Soul""","It was a good read and gave insight that I needed. I have struggled with a vocal cordproblem and this book gave me encouragement to ""keep going."""
5,"Happy Grandson, Happy Life","Great Product received in perfect condition. I've flown ESTES Rockets for three generations, atleast two for sure.Happy Grandson, Happy Life"
4,Good Dictionary. Lacks some slang. Poor Cover,"This dictionary is the best Spanish-English dictionary that I have ever used, especially if you are dealing with Latin American Spanish. It doesn't have all the slang (especially Mexican slang), but it does a better job of telling you where words are used than any other dictionary that I have tried. Occasionally I have found the University of Chicago Spanish-English Dictionary, 4th Edition, to be more helpful when dealing with slang, but this dictionary is far superior for most translation.After 3 years of use, the binding is a little weak and the cover is starting to separate from the book.I'm thinking of buying the CD-ROM version. Does anyone know if it contains the same material as the Hardcover version?"
5,Alien Thunder!!,"I really enjoyed this movie because of Chief Dan George, any movie he is in is great. I probably will watch this 1 over & over. The sound & picture in this movie was great. If ya haven't seen this movie buy it, it will do ya justice. Rich!!!"
4,Almost perfect,"Pretty easy to install, and fits very tight so its not moving around like my usual wall outlets. But my one and only complaint, is that it is very hard to plug stuff in. Its nice that it keeps the plugs from coming out easily, but its just way to hard to put them in."
2,Loose fit,"I do not recommend this item due to it's poor workmenship. It worked fine when I first put it in, but it was a very loose fit. When I took it off to try to adjust it, I could not get the screw back out because the screw sheath had broken free from the housing. I can not get the screw out or reinstall it because the plastic piece is in the way. So it is useless to me. A waste of money."
5,Good stuff.,Works great came fast. Use it at school for all the electrical appliances on my desk. It's a life safer.
1,"Terrible, dangerous design","I have 2 issues with this outlet adapter after installing it only 12 hours ago.1. The housing easily snapped when I attempted to screw it into the outlet. The plastic is very thin and weak.2. Plugs cannot be fully inserted. The electrical plug for my laptop sticks out about 1/4"". This is a fire hazard if something fell across the prongs. It is also a danger for small children as they could easily touch the electrified prongs.I highly recommend to look elsewhere for a solution to expand your electrical outlets."
4,Great outlet,I wanted a cheap power outlet to increase the outlets in my living room and not have to put a cable power outlet with having wires all over the floors.This was great. It is not expensive and it works.
5,They don't make them any better than this!,"I am a large woman who has fallen off two other step stools due to my size and also the poor design(peg like legs). This one is rugged, sturdy, yet light enough for anyone to carry around. The steps have ridges on them so there's no slipping. You have to feel safe in order to be safe. This is definetly designed for safety with the big steps and large handle at the top to hold on to. The big tray at the top is also another feature that is very handy. It will easily hold a bucket of paint and other supplies. Great for indoors or outdoors. An excellent product!!!"
2,not as described... no paper towel holder,I love the size and the large two bottom steps... but... there is no paper towel holder... perhaps this is and old description that amazon has for another model....????
3,disappointing,"I thought this would be a great Blu ray show off title, but there is was too little slow mo of interesting things and way too much chat yak blab and slow mo of really stupid things. Cheerleading in slow mo?? ReallY??"
1,Who needs it?,...While caring for my grandchildren I became acquainted with this contraption and I have to leave a comment about it. I wouldn't have one. It's too heavy. It's too hard to clean because it's so big and because you cannot separate the top from the bottom. It takes up way too much counter and storage space and there is no temperature adjustment. They also had an electric grill with the same problems.
2,its ok,"any time i bought andrew macarthy""s movie. little disapointed. even dont bother to buy it just rented.B rate movie"
4,Satisfied this time,"I was reluctant to order, as we have had problems with these ribbons not working in the past. Trying them one more time was cheaper than buying a new time clock and they worked fine this time."
5,I'm in Love!,"This is the perfect little shoe for making your legs look long and beautiful, and can be worn with shorts, pants, skirts and all in between. Just the cutest shoe and in the perfect color. I wish I had purchased another pair as they are no longer available, except on ebay, but not in my size. Alas, I will have to look for something along this line, but have not found it in more than six months of looking. They run very true to size as do all J. Renee shoes, which I usually do not like. This shoe was the ""exception""."
5,Excellent product but it hurts,This is my first epilator hair remover. I use it for my lip and nothing else. It does hurt slightly because it is done in a very sensitive area but it is less painful than waxing. I have not gone back to waxing since I bought this product. There is no irritation or redness like waxing.It does take some practice but it is worth it. Just be patient and do it when not in a rush.It is a good product for the price. The only disadvantage is it is somewhat noisy.
3,itchy skin after using it,"I have very itchy skin after using it, which can last for a very long time like 2 weeks. And I can see the reason--the skin is irritated and breaking out of the new hair can lead to the itchiness. Does anyone else here have the problem?"
5,This is the best,I decided to try this product after my daughter's friend said it was the best product for removing hair. The first time was painful but well worth it. I have tried waxing which I liked but was becoming very expensive. My skin is also ultra sensitive and products like Nair would severely irritate my skin. Shaving left me with tons of razor bumps since my hair is very coarse. The Remington EP-1000 did not irritate my skin at all. I've used it a few times and each time the hair did come back finer. I wish I would have bought this product a long time ago.
1,Ingrown hairs!,"Yes, it pulls, but yes, it does work as long as you keep at it. The problem is that suddenly I had TONS of ingrown hairs when the hair started to grow back!! Do you know how hard it is to get rid of those???? I had to sit there with tweezers and pull them out one by one because they grow just under a layer of skin. I ended up having to go back to my razor. If you don't want to be bothered with something like that, don't buy this."
1,not worth a dime,"after 70 some reviews, i thought this epilator was a sure winner, but i'd rather shave every day than endure the pain that this thing inflicts every single time it plucks one of the hairs out, and the time that is spent on one leg (up to my knee, i couldn't bring myself up to try the thigh) is 30min. I am returning it ASAP. If anyone wants not to be bothered with returns hastle, do yourself a favor and skip on this epilator."
3,Unacceptable,"This thing is far to painful to be bothered with. I tried this on myself for at least 15 minutes, before attempting to use it on my wife and found it to be slow torture. At one point, it snagged too much hair and came to an immediate and painful halt (thankfully). I understand that some people like pain, but my wife and I do not.Does it work? Like a lawnmower on grass. If you like having your hairs painfully yanked out at super speed, then by all means buy this product."
2,All that glitters is not Gold!,"This product is better than other products of the same line. And the 24 carat gold feature is good and makes it more durable, but I think razor and wax are the painless option and come cheap. It pulls the hair out which makes the whole process painful especially imagine at the places like bikini lines etc. But since the gold is the metal that gives that antibiotic feature with it I think its a good. And if you are brave enough than I think pricing is very good at amazon.com. It does give you a good smooth legs."
3,Not the best for me. My hair grows too quickly,"I have this and have used it off and on for a couple of years, but I stopped recently because I get a lot of ingrown hairs with this product, or hairs that grow just under the surface of the skin. My hair grows very quickly also and I think that contributes to the problem. Most women's hair doesn't grow as quickly as mine, so I think it may be a good product for them. I have very sensitive skin also, I find that a skin buffing system works best for me on my legs, I use a razor elsewhere."
5,silky hair removal system,The Remington EP1000 performs as well or better than I expected it to. I would definately recommend this product to my friends and aquaintances.
1,This EP = Horrible,"Do not under any circumstances by this EP. If you liked the Translating the Name EP, Im pretty sure you're not going to like this. Saosin's music has taken a step backward with Cove as the new lead man. What a shame."
3,"Fine as a first time lightweight review of a PMBOK chapter, but not at all close to the real PMP exam questions","I found the questions in this book to be way easier than questions from other study books and preparation tests, and quite far from the situational questions that you get on the real PMP exam.I would say that as a very lightweight first time review (through a set of questions) for a particular chapter of the PMBOK, this books is fine, but is far from what you'll get in reality on the PMP exam. I used it like that and got almost all the questions right. Just make sure you don't get fooled by that and that you are ready for the exam if you get that.I found quite detrimental that the questions were organized by chapters and not mixed up as a single 200 question set as you get them on the exam. I guess the purpose of the book is not to be a PMP exam test example, just a bunch of Q&As;, so just be aware of this."
5,Great Study Guide,The Q&A guide points out the key area of the PMBOK. It helps users to focuse of the key study area.
5,Camera Carrying Case,This case is excellent. It fits very nicely on my belt so I can take it almost anywhere and not worry about leaving the camera somewhere...it's on my belt!
3,OK Movie,"Found that parts of the movie dragged on but overall, not a horrible movie; just dull in some areas. It's currently sitting in the back of my DVD collection collecting dust since I will most likely not watch it again."
2,Almost Unreadable,"I am typically a fan of Phillipa Gregory, and while I realized that this was not an historical novel, I assumed it would exhibit the same wonderful writing style as do her other works. It doesn't. I agree with another reader-- this is just like a Zelda book. The plot is marginally interesting, the writing is passable but nowhere near insightful or great. Further, so much of this story is unbelievable, no real connections are made between Isobel and certain characters, and the end is thus a totally ridiculous surprise. I was very disappointed by this book."
1,As bland as Zelda's novels,"There isn't much to this novel. I found myself skipping pages just so the story would advance. The plot was predictable from the first few chapters. I was hoping the story would take a turn for the better, perhaps turning into an Ethan Frome type novel, only to be disappointed. Not worth the time or effort."
5,Great cd,This is a really great live cd. Would defintely recommend it especially if you like the crabb family. some of my favorite Gospel songs that they sing on this cd.
1,Cheap junk,"The snap-on attachments broke withing a couple weeks of purchase. The motor on this thing is so weak that it would actually stop when I touched it to my beard. And now that I've had it for about one year, it has completely stopped working altogether. It has no power anymore. It seemed like a great deal at the time, but you live and you learn I guess. Steer clear of this thing, spend a little more, it's worth it in the long run."
1,Total Garbage - Remington should be ashamed,"This one deserves ZERO stars. It looks decent but boy is that deceiving. This product is a total waste of money.I got one of these less than six months before it totally stopped recharging and died. In a way that was a blessing. It made me finally act on my utter dissatisfaction with this Remington product (I'll buy no more from Remington.)It was slow, underpowered, ineffective, too small and awkward to use, uncomfortable on my face and produced poor results.I replaced it with the Panasonic ER206K. The difference is like night and day. Click above on SEE ALL MY REVIEWS for the Panasonic.By comparison, the Panasonic is a joy to use. Unlike my ill-advised spur-of-moment purchase of the Remington, I did my homework on Amazon before purchasing the Panasonic ER206K."
1,disposable blender ?!,"I used this blender once. I noticed the smell of electric wire burning and Voila!: this blender was done. Would not start afterward. I was using the blender to make a smoothie with frozen strawberries - nothing more. So, if you would like to buy a disposable, throw-away blender, here 'tis!"
1,Get a frying pan instead...,"No open flame equals bland fried taste. The product description is not very accurate. The ""grill"" is a ribbed griddle and you cannot get that outdoor grilled flavor on this unit. Mine went back the day I received it. Consider the new Weber portable or the new Coleman RoadTrip."
4,great cooking,the grill is easy to clean easy to store and easy to pack for camping . we wouldnt leave without the grill.
2,could be dangerous,I had a great deal of trouble keeping the top to stay up. While cooking the top fell down and when the top is 300 degrees this could be very dangerous.
2,Thermos Grill-2-Go,"All though the grill portion is excellent, the leg assembly has a grave problem. When tightening the support legs using the hand screws, the assembly will crack very easily, as this portion of the leg is very weak due to the way it is constructed. It requires reinforcement in this area due to the high stress while in the supporting position. The third time I used this gas grill, one of the legs cracked where the locking screw secures the leg assembly."
3,Could have been better,"As usual, the beatles can rescue any inferior product from oblivion just by being on it, and that's what they have done here. First up we had the British Beatle special which really seemed like a show that they put on to help their struggling friends, I mean, who are the Vernon sisters and it's very easy to see why Millie's run of hits stopped after ""My Boy Lollypop"". Mind you, the choreography was very well done for it's time and if there was ever a band that deserved success and recognition but never got it it was ""Sounds Incorporated"".As for the concert footage, I'm sure that there was better quality stuff they could have used, or failing that they could have shelled out some bucks and restored it. But I did like the American TV ad for the Beatle cinema concert. All in all, I'd say buy this DVD but don't pay too much for it, because it's really not worth it."
4,StrongArm tailgate support,I had a tailgate that no longer stayed up and was using a piece of wood to prop it open. I purchased two of the supports. Due to the way the supports are installed I was only able to replace one (the instructions are vague so pay attention how it goes when removing the old one). One support works just great. Will almost push itself open when you unlock it. Highly recommend these.
5,As advertised,"The product arrived quickly and in perfect condition. It was installed per the instructions, and the tailgate door works better than when it was brand new."
4,This is a very fun toy. Great value!,"This is a really fun and challenging toy for young and adults. I agree with previous reviews that you do need to have another winder, to be able to stack them all. It is fun nevertheless and a great value."
2,Bad Spinner,"Very disappointed in the device used to spin the tops. It was weak and did not catch well on the individual tops. It keeps slipping and releasing the tops - even before we are done winding them. By the time you have had a successful ""wind and release"" the previous top has stopped spinning."
4,I like it,"This is the only rice cooker I have owned, so I can't compare it to others. But I can tell you that my experience with it has been good.Basically, what I wanted was rice like I get at the take-out Chinese restraunt I go to. Sticky, tasty, white rice. You just can't accomplish this kind of rice on the stovetop. I've tried, came close, but no cigar.The first few times I used my ricemaker, I was dissapointed - only to find out I wasn't making the rice correctly. You have to follow the directions IN the box of the ricemaker, not on the bag of rice. After I got my directions right, I've been able to make hassle-free, perfect rice. It's cheap, easy and relatively fast. What more could you want?... mine does not bubble over at all. It honestly makes fantastic rice all the time."
2,Not a great choice,"After seeing my friend's rice cooker I was excited to buy one. There are two basic models: the ""sealed"" type and the types like this one, which just have a lid. I bought this one because it was cheaper, but the sealed ones work much better and are well worth the money. This one bubbles up and I have to keep the lid propped open. It's messy and for this reason I don't use it very often. I'm going to buy a sealed one and I suggest the same for you."
1,Review.,"Well this product is complete waste of $99.00. I thought this would be mattress but this is like a thick bedsheet. May be bedskirt, thats it. Its overpriced."
4,Joan of Arc,Joan of ArcJoan of Arc should be recommended for teens 13-16. I thought it was kind of hard to understand because I got 60% on this Accelerated Reader test. I didn't understand the Crowning of the Kings and Princesses very well. I would rate this a 6/10 in a rating.It taught me about how some people can get so sick of things that you would do anything to save your country. This book is cool because of the pictures of the war.
3,Some Good...Some Bad,"I liked the opening scenes, even though they were a bit cliche. At the very least you saw what each character was leaving. The battle scenes were quite real and well done in my opinion. I hated the ending. Someone else noted the lack of a Hollywood ending, but I would have preferred it. (SPOILER WARNING) I got very emotionally invested in the two main guys and was devastated when I saw they both died. I realize they're going for realism, but they need to remember its a movie that's meant to entertain. I was very into the sequence of the letter reading/writing. For it all to come crashing down in the end and that's the way the movie ends? Very poor...didn't like it at all."
2,Just Couldn't Get Into It,"Libby Duclaux is a rich widow living in the Italian Alps after the death of her husband. Old friend Aaron Conrad is trying to get her to stop mourning and live again. He convinces her to return home to Washington State by telling her that her sister, who is having a high risk pregnancy, needs her help. Libby has no intention of staying long term, but Aaron is convinced he can change her mind and that he may be falling in love.Even though we are told numerous times that Libby is a charatable, self-sacrafing person, she has a threadbare wardrobe because she gives so much money to orphans; she just came off as self-absorbed. Aaron is stock nice-guy, romantic lead. I did not realy believe thier chemestry or care for Libby. The secoundary characters are far more interesting and likeable. I am told they are featured in other Stella Cameron stories, hopefully those stories are more enjoyable."
3,Too small,I did not notice that this pin is so small. You can buy a longer one at target for cheaper price (what I did) but it is nice and cute! Maybe for your children or if you want it to be small then it has good quality
2,Nice shave- poor design,"I have had my TCT shaver for a year and a half. After about 7 months, the trimmer had trouble staying down. Today, the trimmer stopped working all together. The shave is nice, but dont expect it to perform as close as they say. I have a tough beard and it does not perform as well on tough beards."
5,GREAT SHAVER FOR THE PRICE,THE MS3-1000 CORDLESS SHAVER IS A GREAT BUY FOR THE PRICE. I'VE HAD MINE FOR FOUR YEARS AND WITH PROPER MAINTANCE (NEW HEADS AND SCREEN) IT KEEPS ON DOING WHAT I EXPECT IT TO DO- A CLEAN SHAVE EVERY TIME.
3,"Close shave, but screens don't last more than 1 month","Closest shave I've had with an electric razor(5 stars), but the life of the screens are the worst I've ever experienced (1 star). I replace each of the 3 independant screens about once a month. The last two I put in chipped after only 1 week! Anybody else have this problm with this model?"
1,SUCKS,All 3 were defective!!!!! They replaced 1 in all said the other 2 and that 1 all went bad in 3 months!!!!!!!
1,Just buried our second one.,My first one stopped working after two uses. We returned it and got another. The quality on the second one was much improved. It worked six times before it died.
1,SALTON COOKER- TOOO BAD!!!,I bought this rice cooker today from store. As soon as I removed from the package and tried to keep it on table it could not stand straight. The Base was all damaged. Not just that the quality of metal plate in bottom is flimsy..screws are pathetic... Never buy this one!
1,Don't bother,Because of the high heating element tempature the water bubbles up at a terrible rate and pushes water bubbles through the small steam hole in lid. This means the rice cooker and anything near by get a starch coating which means clean up is a real pain. It always over cooks the rice at the bottom and it all sticks. Have to soak the pot to get it clean. Now shopping for a much better machine for this one left a bad taste in our mouth regards using a rice cooker.
2,Don't waste your money on a cheap rice cooker,Don't waste your money on a cheap rice cooker. I have used many rice cookers in the past and have found that cheap products like the Salton RA3 are not worth the bother. These cheaper cookers usually create a mess and often burn or dry out the cooked rice. Fortunately there are some better products out there for you if you want to spend a bit more money. I donated my Salton to Goodwill and upgraded to a Zojirushi and I am getting a lot of use out of it without all of the hassles.
3,My 20 year old rice cooker died -- thanks for the warning about the newer models,"Hi -- My 3 star rating is actually for my maybe-20-year-old 3 cup Salton rice cooker which looked just like thisnew one. It just died (I think the heating element went.) The reviews are helping me steer clear. (Insert snarky but apparently well deserved comment about ""they don't make them like they used to."") The old one didn't boil over but rice oftenstuck to the bottom even when I put a small amount of cooking oil in to avert the problem. It was a good little workhorse butnot worth trying to replace with the same model, evidently. Have had the same problem trying to replace my 1970s crockpot which died earlier this year after a 30 year lifespan -- the new one overheats and threatens to scorch the countertop. But that's another story."
1,Salton Rice cooker,"I was recently given this rice cooker as a gift. Used it 3 times only and for no reason I can see, it just stopped working. I was able to use it just long enough to see the value of a rice cooker and now I will replace it with what I hope will be a better product."
1,Poor design. North worth even a 10 dollars,"I bought it on a Friday Sale for around 10 dollars, and then found it's nearly garbage. The Amazon ""List Price"" is obviously too high for this little thing. Don't believe it."
1,Don't Walk. Run!!,This rice cooker crapped out on us after just one use. When we returned it; the lady said that they've had a slew of returns for Salton rice cookers. I guess it's just hit or miss with these guys judging from the reviews.
2,Eh... Could do better,"This was an OK rice cooker for someone just starting out on their own. But after only 2 years of use, not even constant use, mind you, it's pretty much useless. It won't stay on ""cook,"" keeps switching to the ""warm"" function, and now, when the unit is on, it makes a horrible smell, almost like burnt plastic. We babied this machine by only hand washing it, and always storing it properly but it still gave out. The rice it put out was decent. Never burned. Hard to make the Persian Tadik (spelling?) with the aluminum body, my next one will be non-stick. So if you need a cheap cooker to get you through a couple of years, but don't expect it to hang around, then this might be your cooker."
1,don't buy it,"I've now had three of these. Fortunately, I only paid for the first. (The second was a replacement for the first, and the third was a wedding gift.)Each unit broke after 5 or fewer uses. You might get lucky if you buy one, but don't count on it. Better to buy a model with a reputation for quality. Or learn to cook rice the old fashioned way, which is what I'm doing right now because the piece of junk just broke down on me.Update: These rice cookers are repairable. I still highly recommend that you don't buy one, but if you're stuck with one and getting a replacement or a refund is too much hassle, getting it repaired might make sense. In my case, the problem was a burnt fuse. Of course, it's quite possible that the fuse will blow again."
1,broke after 3rd use,I thought this would be a great product for small portions especially for a single person. I used it twice and it worked well but the third time it stopped cooking after a couple minutes. Unfortunately this was after 30 days of the purchase and I was not allowed to return it to Amazon. I tried geting in touch with the Salton company but they have not responded. I am very dissatisfied with the purchase. I feel like I gave away my money.
1,Died after second use - wish I'd read these reviews,"What an amazingly awful product. Yes, it worked properly ... twice. The third time was the charm -- it simply died.I can't think of a better defintion of ""worthless"" in any product."
1,Don't waste your money or time buying it.,"Hi all,I used it 2 times. The 3rd time it didn't work any longer. What a piece of junk. I guess you get what you pay for. I just wanted a rice cooker for one or two servings. It is hard to find any others."
4,TAMING THE TIGER,"MY MAC DOESN'T HAVE CURRENT SOFTWARE, BUT UPDATING TO OS X TIGER WAS MY BEST OPTION. AFTER INSTALLATIONREFERENCE TO THE USERS GUIDE WAS WORTH ITS' WEIGHT IN GOLD. (ALMOST)EVERY QUESTION I HAD WAS ANSWERED IN THE MANUAL, SO IF YOU CAN READ PLAIN ENGLISH, YOU HAVE IT MADE.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MANUAL TO MAC OS X TIGER USERS AFTER TRYING OTHER SO-CALLED GUIDES."
1,yuck,I was very excited about this after reading the reviews. Please know that it is scented and it is the consistency of Desitin - it is half flake/half cream.
1,It's going into the recycling box,"I was looking for a book on surrendering. I searched and searched and found Kathy Cordova's. After reading all the reviews, I thought this just might be the right one. But after reading a third of the book, I've decided that it's one of the worst books I've ever read. I could not help but think that this woman sound so self-centered and narcissistic, because one would have to be in order to write a book centered around all the little details on how she surrendered. Kathy Cordova might have the right idea about spiritual surrendering. But she does not seem to have the emotional and spiritual depth to author a book on this topic yet."
3,"Great book, but needs the answers","I ordered this since my sister received it and thought it was a great book. Unfortunately, this copy does not come with the answers. Look for the hard cover version, that has the answers in the back."
5,A book for all ages,"This book is just wonderful. Even though it's from ages 5-9, myfriends and I got stumped on a couple. When I went to a party, Ibrought it with me and everyone was all over it."
3,Got to Have 'Em,"Shaving every day will wear down the best of blades. The sad part is, the replacement blades and screen are about 50% the cost of the original razor. Might be better to stretch out the life of the blades and then replace the razor."
3,Works but kinda painful,"Does what it is supposed to do. Fairly easy to install. My one complaint is that since I installed them, my shaver has a tendency to pull on my hairs at times which can be painful and annoying. Considering getting a new shaver."
1,Didn't work,"The screens and blades fit into the shaver, but they don't line up properly causing me to not get a close shave. Which is the whole point isn't it?"
5,Remington screens,"We had the shipment on time as promised, and there was no damage. These screens are getting harder to come by, and we appreciate being able to order from Amazon and getting good service, saving us from buying new razors."
3,good product,The foil cover is easy to be broken. But the replacement is good. It is still a little expensive.
5,Excellent product and Shipping time!,This product was exactly as described and was shipped very quickly just as they promised. Great job!
2,"OK Product, but others are better","This product delivers decent value for the price. However, GoFit has a similar products that comes with a DVD that includes training programs and exercises that feature the stability disc. I train alot at home and I have found that most of GoFit's products come with an instructional DVD. This is a big help for beginners and experienced exercisers and a tremendous value."
3,"Good product, but check size","I bought this without paying attention to the dimensions. Completely my fault, just didnt give it a thought that they made them this small. I have used these in my local gym, but they are twice as big.My main complaint is the istructions. I know, you're thinking ""how hard can it be to use a ball?"" Specifically, I would like to have had some direction on how far to inflate it. It comes inflated, but I am not sure if it is inflated to the level it should be, or if it has lost some air sitting in wharehouses, getting heated/cooled in transit, etc. It also does not list a weight limit, so I guess it's OK to loan it to my 350lb neighbor.Otherwise, it is fun to balance on with one foot, sit on for pilates type moves, and to use for pushups. It does roll side-to-side when on it with one foot but this is mainly due to it's small size and POSSIBILY inproper inflation. I will continue to research how far to blow it up."
5,great,This is identical to the one I use at the gym I go to. I like the fact that it is already inflated. It is a perfect size.
5,GREAT GRILL & OVEN,"SURPRISE=SURPRISE=IT DOES EVERYTHING THEY SAY AND MORE=UPS JUST DELIVERED IT AND WE PUT IT TO THE TEST=MADE THE BEST JIFFY-MIX CORN BREAD AND DID IT IN FIVE MINUTES=THATS RIGHT, FIVE MINUTES AND IT WAS DELICIOUS=THIS IS PERFECT FOR TWO OR THREE PEOPLE AND CUTE AS A BUTTON=HAMBURGERS TASTE GREAT ALSO=WHAT A CLEVER CONCEPT TO HAVE A GRILL AND OVEN ALL IN ONE=WE HAVE OWNED ABOUT EVERY TYPE GRILL MADE AS WELL AS TOASTER OVENS AND THIS UNIT REPLACES THEM ALL=WE FOLLOWED THE DIRECTIONS AND USED A TINY BIT OF COOKING OIL AS WAS RECOMMENDED AND CLEAN UP WAS A SNAP=WHOEVER CAME UP WITH THIS CONCEPT HAS MY VOTE=VERY SELDOM IS ANYTHING AS GOOD AS ADVERTISED=THIS IS EVEN BETTER THAN ADVERTISED!"
4,Good for kids!,"I purchased this as a gift for a dino loving adult. The game was nice, but more suited for a 7-18 range of child/adolescent.Good dino facts on the cards, good playing pieces."
2,Could be better,"I bought this book for a class I was taking. It's not a bad book however, if you have any experience with IPA or other phonics ... it's confusing. The reviews at the end of the chapter are tedious & repeat as you get further along. I suppose that if you don't need to complete the book for class it might be better. Overall I wouldn't reccomend this book. There has to be something better for phonics boot camp."
