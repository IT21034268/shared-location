3,Works well,"Bought this as a spare ""key"".Works well.A bit expensive for a magnet, but at least my son is kept out of the cupboards."
2,Not what I ordered,"I ordered the tot lock magnetic key to replace the one we misplaced (suspect 2 year old threw it away :)). The magnetic key that arrived in the mail is not the Tot-Lok that is pictured. It looks as if it is a older generation version. The package says Safety 1st magnetic locking system key but it is shaped differently and when held up to the cabinet did not unlock like the original Tot-Lok we had did. I called Amazon and they told me they would resend the item to me and expedited the shipping to me for free. Unfortunately, when the package arrived it was the same key I had received from them the 1st time. Either the picture is wrong on the website or the information not accurate. I am returning both for a refund and had to order directly from the Tot-Lok company which I believe is not owned by Safety 1st (maybe used to?)."
4,"Not hapy about theprice, but found a workaround","We have the Safey 1st tot locks on our chemical, bathroom, and treat cabinets, and we used to have 4 magnets. We love these locks, they do give you some peace of mind..... Until our 2 year old hides them (still unfound even tried using the android magnetic sensors). So to bpass the locks, you can unscrew a hinge if they're external or snake your. arrm thrgh a drawer if you're lucky.Anyway.. I'm one of those guys that kees hard. drive magnnets around and I'm using that until I get the 2 magnets I just ordered.Also, If your kids are acrobats, you should look at mounting a cupboad hook in the cieling away from climbable objects. Hang a key ring where both adults can reach it with arm fully extended and tha should solve the snack pilferage ;)"
3,Ian mc shane the best,This movie felt more like a play you have to give it a chance to really enjoy the story. Ian Mcshane is the best thing in the movie except every time I see him I cannot help but see him as a dirty mouthed mustached saloon owner in deadwood.
3,"Poetic, but <yawn> a little talky...","Not bad for the price, this adventure game is fairly easy for the experienced gamer. Its real strength is in the setting (a snowy Canadian landscape) and the characters, who are all developed over frequent cut-scenes. If anything, the game is pretty talky, and at times you'll do anything to get back to the action. A moderate recommendation to fans of the survival horror genre; all others should probably steer clear."
2,More of a movie then an actual game,"D2 has it's moments but for the most part this game is just plain boring. The graphics are stellar, the cinematics were well done and the controls are pretty easy to learn, but when it comes to actual gameplay, there is a lack there of. The game consists of four discs of little more then repetive cgi movies. You control a women who never speeks on camera but supposidly does off. You are forced to trek back and forth to the same spots over and over again killing the same monsters in the same spots the same way each time. 90% of the time you will have no control of what is going on and just sit back and watch. And for every little thing your character does, open doors, pick up an item and so on, you are forced to watch a quick cut scene, Everytime. It gets very old very fast. For those who actualy like to play games rather then look over your friends shoulder and watch, look elsewhere. Don't even bother with this coaster."
2,This is only a Stereo SACD...not Multichannel.,"I bought this SACD because I loved the movie Amadeus when I was growing up. I also finally have a decent SACD audio setup. Not having many Classical SACDs, and knowing that SACD quality is most appreciated with classical or jazz, I went ahead and bought this.Nowhere in the description is the fact that this is a stereo recording. I thought classical was always recorded in multichannel...otherwise, what's the point? You want that orchestra playing all around you, not just immediately in front of you.Anyway, at least the musical selections are great. But the description really needs to mention the stereo part. I'm a little disappointed."
1,Disappointing,"I too, bit the bullet, and paid what I thought was a rather extravagant price for a DVD and am disappointed with the content. I was also very surprised others haven't felt the same way. I agree with the other reviewer who expressed disappointment in the lack of a good demonstration of each exercise, etc. I am persevering (motivated somewhat by how much money I spent on this) and trying to do some of the exercises and hoping for some positive results. Very misleading advertisement for this DVD and I still don't understand why it cost so much!"
5,Thorough and helpful,"This is not a flashy pretty video, but a low budget production. Don't let that put you off. No waterfalls or new age music here. Host Dr Kevin Lau sold me when I read that he was a member of an international scoliosis research body. That gives his method some credibility. I'm just starting his exercises and they seem to work. I am getting some relief and I feel more balanced.This DVD is in several manageable parts. He recommends starting with the beginner exercises before moving to the advanced as described in his book. Good advice because I tried some of the advanced strengthening exercises ahead of schedule and it was a little painful. I started over a few days later with the easier 'aligning' exercises and I'm back in business. I am feeling better after just a few days. The exercises are gentle and get the muscles back where they need to be. It makes sense. I would recommend this DVD to fellow scoliosis sufferers."
3,Fairly Good.,"I was hoping for more airplanes. They only have around 10 in the whole book. Half of the book is telling how planes fly and the best way to fly the planes in the book. If you are looking for a teaching aid then it's probably a good book. If you are just interested in folding paper airplanes, then it might not be the best book for you, but it does have a couple of planes that I had never seen before."
4,Hot Capacitor,"I was trying to fix a problem with my RV AC, bought this on recommendations from forums. It did not fix the problem, but after I corrected the real problem, this made a huge difference on how easily the capacitor kicks on now. Good price!"
1,THIS IS NOT A PASTE OVER,THIS IS NOT A PASTE OVER !!!!! PASTE OVERS DO NOT< NEVER HAD< AND NEVER WILL HAVE A RED SEAL ON THE COVER NEVER !!!
1,"Not real ""butcher"" cover","I am old enough to have bought these covers fresh off the rack--I have one ""In the Chest covers"" There Is NO seal-First-there is no sealSecond-In the Stone age, Before Collectibles, as soon as we heard there was a ""Cover under A Cover"" we all went and gently steamed the second cover off-and Voila! Beatles with butchered baby dolls.Unfortunately, I didn't have one but my best friends sister did (dang) but back then it wasn't a big deal! She just stuffed in with all the other albums. So I would be VERY careful about this!The only way to tell-seriously, used to be with an x-ray.I DON'T believe an authentic one would sell for so cheap. Unless you really, really, for real need a couple hundred bucks. There just wasn't that many. Even the fact that Yesterday and Today the Chest cover is selling shows The Beatles complete AWsomeness."
3,poor software,"Okay, so I only listen to KCRW in santa monica, and I can usually just turn off the software interface once the radio is on -- but does the interface have to be so hideous?Hardware wise, the radio can pick up signals semi-competently. I've found plugging in my own antenna array helps. Your mileage may vary."
4,USB Radio,This is a great idea even though I wish I did not have to have another wire hanging from the back of my computer. The product works allowing you to listen in FM station in stereo.However note THERE IS NO AM with this radio. The software is not pretty but it works. The radio can be plugged staight into any speakers or thru a sound card.Also the antenna on my product broke but a trip to Radio Shack found an easy replacement an audio plug with two wires. I do not know if the poor weld was specific only to my part. It broke after a year. The last time a checked Dlink has a rebate making the radio even more affordable.
3,There has to be something better out there.,"This was the best product I could find in it's class, but the type for the hebrew is impossibly small, and often inaccurate - jots and tittles missing, whatever. It is for study, not reading, and not always useful for study unless you have other better sources to consult. I should not have been surprised as an English Bible by the same translator had over 200 errors it it."
3,Bigger letter please !!!,"I bought this book because it contains both hebrew old testament (from masorah) and greek new testament (from majority text, that is used only by KJV group and not by other good tranlations) in single volume that makes it's price lower than two separated volume.But the letters in original language are printed so small that I couldn't see clearly even after using magnifiying lens, expecially hebrew one.This problem gives me a lot of difficulties, considering not every words are indexed to Strong's number and considering there are various words (that give more information about the subject, object, aspects and time) from one stem that are indexed as one Strong number's."
5,A Definite Classic- Right Up There w/ Suffer and No Control,"This is the album we've all been waiting for- a comeback from the mediocre past 3 albums. Brett, of course, is back in the lineup and BR is back on Epitaph, where they belong. And the music- well, its pretty amazing. Supersonic blasts off with fast guitars and great lyrics reminescent of the good ol' days, and no other track after it dissapoints. The lyrics are typically great, but with Brett writing with Greg now, they are even more insightful than when it was just Greg. The music is a blend, not a monotonous melodic hardcore cd, but one with variety and excellent musicianship. My favorite tracks are Supersonic, Can't Stop it, Broken, Sorrow, and Materialist. This cd just blew me away the second I heard the first riffs of Supersonic. I haven't taken it out of my player since I got it on the 23. Any BR fan, whether you like Suffer or Stranger Than Fiction, needs to buy this."
3,Good NOT great,"Bad Religion is one of the best bands out their, but this CD really isnt their best most of the songs are good ( my favorite is broken) if you like or want too like them check out their old stuff first"
5,Great CD from beginning to end...,"I bought this CD originally for 2 songs...Sorrow and The Defense. Then I started to listen to the entire thing and it's great. I listen to it all the time. It's great music to drive to, get's you all pumped up. I wouldn't say that I am the biggest Bad Religion fan but this CD has made me want to get the rest of their CD's. I would recommend this CD to anyone. It's great."
5,He Was Always At the Top,"Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel remained at the head of OKW from 1938 until the end of World War II in 1945. He was the only top commander who held his position throughout the war. He was a part of everything that happened. Often Hitler's whipping boy and by no means the finest of Field Marshals, nevertheless he had an astonishing ability at organization and remained unquestionably loyal to his government until the end. With the recent release of two biographies of Field Marshal von Manstein this biography of Keitel has regained its importance. They complement each other in many ways and it was always Manstein that Keitel recommended for his own job if he were to be replaced."
5,Thumbs UP,"Nothin special about these, but they work well. Good sound and the batteries hold up well."
3,fs radios,"They're ok, but we can't use them because the headphones are useless and we already had fs radios but they don't have vox. That's why we bought these for use on the motorcycles."
1,WHERE IS FIFA ON THE DREAMCAST?!?!?!?,"Virtua Striker 2, although a brilliant game graphically, blows the big one once you start playing. The abscence of the turbo button, a camera switch, and being able to score really adds to the boring gameplay. If you score, you might as well have beat the game because you get the ball intercepted in a snap . The players look good but thats about it. Gameplay ... ..its boring...and as a soccer fan I love a good soccer game and I will ususally play an outdated one on psx for the heck of it just because I love anything that has to do with soccer. But Virtua Striker 2 just is not soccer. WHERE IS FIFA??? I LOVE THE FIFA GAMES FOR PC AND PSX BUT WHY NO FIFA 2001 FOR DREAMCAST?? I guess I will have to grit my teeth until a good soccer game comes to DC."
1,Objectively: avoid this game...very very bad value!,"Aside from the ""cool"" graphics, which by the way one should already EXPECT from a Sega Console, the game has NOTHING going for it that really renders it a good value for your money. As someone else mentioned, you CAN NOT use the Analog Thumb Pad. I personally could NOT believe this! Buying this game is going back all the way to the player control capabilities of the FIRST Nintendo. What's the point of the ""cool"" graphics of a high powered console like Sega, if you at the same time, have the control abilities of the first video game consoles? This makes no sense. Unless you want to control your players just like you did the FIRST Mario Brothers (remember that up/down/left/right cross?), and at the same time PAY for a CD, high graphic level game, then go ahead and buy Virtual Stricker. I personally recommend that you STAY AWAY from this game, and pay for something that is REALLY worth the cost of a console like Sega."
5,NEED MORE SEASONS,OMG! I'M SOOOO HOOKED! THIS IS THE BEST SHOW I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. THATS IT.BUY IT NOW!
3,A little disappointed,"I was a little disappointed by this map. I had purchased the Madrid, Spain one a few years back as was so impressed by it. It was handier and more accurate than some of the travel books in the bookstore. But Paris wasn't as useful. It didn't tell us much of what we were interested in for a city with so much history and culture. It is better suited for those more interested in the fashion and shopping Paris has to offer rather than seeing the sights."
2,Ikros Cradle w/Speakers for HTC Tytn aka Cingular 8125,"I don't want to be too critical about the product because I bought it with intention to modify it from the very beginning so that I could use it with HTC TyTN II (aka Cingular 8925). It was extremely easy to disassemble, and access/remove external connectors (2.5mm Stereo Sub-mini Plug, and the ""USB -mini""), but that is where disappointment begin. I was able to connect my TyTN II to the ""USB-mini"", but the sound quality was awful. The Ikros docking station does not have any RF shielding, and therefore all the noise came `laud and clear""...If anyone reading this post wants to reference how to change pin-out of the ""USB-mini"" connector please reference [....] I found it invaluable.Good luck!"
1,what happened?,I used it once and loved the sound. tried it a second time and it quit working. would not recommend it!!!
2,Too much,This book is more for the professional builder then for the do it yourself. I would bother with this one unless you have the skills to build it.
3,Great for a first-timer...,"I purchased this book and quickly found that it is basically a catalog of plans that are available free online from USDA and others. The web links for the plans are printed right in the back. If you spend some time surfing, you'll find much of the useful information (and more) without purchasing the book.There is helpful information in the planning section, and some basic tools and methods to get started. It would also be a helpful book for those newly transplanted city-folks to read prior to jumping into raising livestock.If you have experience with livestock or construction, you can find all you need online. If you are planning your first projects, this will be helpful."
1,"Stale, old, pitiful","Gourmet? There was large disappointment when we opened this box to find kettle corn that was old and stale, as well as all stuck together. Maybe it got wet - maybe it stayed in the warehouse too long. Don't waste your money - buy something else!"
1,Crap,"Definately one of the worst Marvel storylines ever, Sins Past has the stupid plot of mutant babies trying to kill Peter. Guess who the parents are? Yup, GWEN AND NORMAN. This is like kicking the great Turning Point storyline in the balls and breaking its shins."
1,Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 8: Sins Past,"Quite possibly the WORST Spider-Man story I have ever read. Take it from a real Spidey fan who's read more issues of Amazing Spider-Man than he hasn't. Gwen's death has a special place in the hearts of every Spider-Man. JMS just took that respect and specialness and drug it through the mud. The besides being an absolutely AWFUL concept and idea, the story conflicts with continuity at several points. It destroys the ""tell all"" type of relationship Peter and Mary Jane have. And above all else, it degrades Gwen Stacy and completely sours her reputation. I can't emphasize how truly horrible this story is. Please: if you haven't read it, don't bother. It will only taint your memory of that sweet little blond named Gwen. And if you have read it: Promptly forget it and disregard it as I have."
5,Shaved strokes off my game,"This book mentions every single thing that you really shouldn't do with your golf game. Not just jokes in here, but real tips that you've heard from players and pros alike."
1,How Can You Know?,"I have bought all of my recently purchased digital camera stuff here. So far, everything works great. I would like to buy a card reader, but the reviews are scary -- especially the cards getting damaged by the reader. I wrote to SanDisk about this problem, but have heard nothing back. I hope more purchasers will write additional reviews to let us know about the card damage problem"
3,So - So,"Some of the stickers are so large that they are hard to use in an album, they would be more appropriate for posters. Then there is a section of tiny sayings to use. The printing is so small in one group that one really has to look at it to read when in an album. The tiny ones are a dark print on a dark background that make it even harder to read. To make it even harder to use these, the tiny ones need to be cut apart as needed. When I cut one out of the middle that I want, I end up loosing the ones that were on either side because they are so small. I won't be purchasing these again for use in a photo album."
1,definitely used... so much it wasn't valid!!!,"I purchased this because we inadvertantly lost our original copy, so I just needed an archive copy. I needed to use it for a feature install and the authentication code this version came with was used so many times it would not work. I found this out because I had to call Microsoft for a fix. MS fixed it for us, but this vendor was not in good stead with me after this episode. I've used Amazon many times and this was my first bad experience. I have wanted to follow-up on this but just keep putting it off until I received this request for a review of the transaction."
3,Solved my problem with Microsoft updates,The OEM versions of MS Office Professional 2003 has valid MS Product Keys that I had lost from my original discs. I needed to reinstall on a new computer and got many errors on install but between the old and this disk I am back in operation and have valid updating capability.
1,Don't buy from this company,We ordered 2 copies of Microsoft office Professional 2003. The supplier- Hamilton 11232 - sent only 1 copy and has ignored our follow-up communication requesting delivery information on the second copy.
1,NOT HAPPY WITH PRODUCT,"IT SHOWED IT WAS THE OLDER VERSION OF OFFICE PRO 2003 , BUT I RECIEVED THE UPGRADE VERSION AND THATS NOT WHAT IT SAID , NOT HAPPY AT ALL AND PROBLEY WONT ORDER AGAIN , IT SHOULD HAVE SAID UPGRADE VERSION ITS NOT A STAND ALONE VERSION"
4,The last good version of Office,"This is the last version before Microsoft introduced that horrible ribbon, a user interface so bad it needs a search engine. Open Office is nearly as good and it's free, but if you need 100% Microsoft Office compatibility and don't want your computer to treat you like a semi-literate who can't read a menu, this is what you want."
3,What can I say,"What can I say,It's a Bubba Bill product with all the typical Microsoft BaggageI would use open Office if I could !!But until the rest of the Known world Weins itself off the Microsoft teetM.S. Office is unfortunatly a Necessary EVIL."
2,Get StarOffice from SUN its better and much less,The new Office Professional has virtually no improvements over office 2000. I am tired of making the rich richer. StarOffice does all I need and is easier to use. I don't like the locked binary files which is just part of the monopoly this product promotes.
2,Major problems since hour 1,"My current issue is Outlook locks up for no good reason constantly. This has caused a bunch of interesting problems, such as when I try and synch my palm and outlook decides now is hard lock time. I get this nice little message in the system tray informing me that outlook appears to be locked up or has stopped responding. This is obvious to me. Luckily I was mailed a copy of this from MS (I guess you buy 36 copies of Office 2000 Pro and they love you). I have submitted numerous feedbacks, an average of 2 or 3 error reports per day, disabled com add-ins, etc. As it stands Outlook has been giving me hell. Also, the junk email filter, I don't know what logic they're using but it isn't half as effective as cloudmark or GFI.Excel now does rock, word seems slightly improved, access I have not played around much with but it appeared to work. My question though, WHY IS CLIPPY STILL ALIVE!??!!?AHHHH!!!"
1,THIS IS A FAKE!!!! DO NOT BUY!!!!,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. IT IS A FAKE COPY AND DOES NOT WORK. NEVER PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM HOLLIS.
5,once a scholar always a scholar,the ability to speak to the layman and explain his message or the message of the subject is donein his usual faultless way.
1,disappointed....nice try JC,"The only reason I gave this cd 1 star was because I only liked 1 song, out of all 17 tracks. JC did a very big let down with his desperate attempt at being solo. He should have just skipped this piece of crap album, a took his rightful place in Nsync so they can start their 4th album. JC, you are no Justin Timberlake!. All in all, avoid this cd at all cost. So sad, he was my fav in Nsync"
1,No Solo Career--JC needs Justin and other Nsyncers,"This Cd is so cliche. But what would you expect from a has-been ex-boybander. JC is a detritus of the -boy-band era trying so hard to have a solo career that's not going anywhere. As evidenced in this CD of hackneyed laughable lyrics, he's a mediocre talent. It's almost comical. No surprise that this CD is a flop. If you like real rock, I recommend that you explore matchboxtwenty and their music."
5,TOO BAD!!!!!!,"It really is too bad this cd didn't get the proper recognition it deserved. I if he had used more urban producers he could have attracted that market like his band mate did, unfortunatley JC decided to take us on a very scary ride. His cd is all over the place and that's what I like about it. His voice is great, some of the content is x-rated though...lol. But it was a great debut.I actually find myself listening to this cd still even a couple of years later, unlike that of his bandmate. I'm just not into that urban sound I guess. I much perfer a more pop/rock/ schizo sound."
3,Not bad...better then his buddy Justin's album..,This album is somewhat good and a forsure fact better then his pal Justin from Nsynce!Give this album a try before thinking of giving Justin's!
4,late buyer...and this album backs up its name =),"I only just recently purchased Schizophrenic, and its already getting more play than Justin Timberlake's FutureSex/LoveSounds. Don't get me wrong, I love both albums just the same. It seems like J.C. was ahead of his time when he released Schizophrenic two years ago. Okay we all know about the strong sexual content in the lyrics of some of the songs on Schizophrenic, but don't let it deter you from buying the album. The beats of each songs alone are worth listening to.My favorite tracks are: Some Girls (Dance With Women), She Got Me, 100 Ways, Shake It, All Day Long I Dream About Sex, Come To Me, Blowin' Me Up (With Her Love)..although the slower songs are worth listening to; I'm more partial to the middle/high-tempo songs.If you have FutureSex/LoveSounds and not this album, I strongly recommend that you go and get this one!"
1,Bleeding Ears,"I just finished listening to this Schizophrenic peice of crap and I now use the disc to scoop my cats poop out of the litter box. I must say the worst thing I ever heard. ""All Day Long I Think About Sex""! How about ALL DAY LONG I THINK ABOUT SLITTING MY WRIST AFTER LISTENING TO THAT SONG. JC, your 15 minutes ended before Andy even had a chance to start the stop watch."
3,JC's first album is not that bad.,I am a huge NSYNC fan. I loved Justin Timberlake's Justified album. So when I found out that JC was finally releasing this new album I was excited. I have to say JC's album was pretty good. It was very different then any other album I have ever hear. He is so far from NSYNC right now and you would not think it was JC when you hear the album. I was glad he did it that way. When I heard the whole album I had different feels about it. First I knew I liked it but I did not like that he did not show a lot of his vocals on a lot of the songs. He has such a nice voice but he did not really show it off. But I do think he did a great job. I am sad to say that I know it probably will not even sell close to what Justin's sold. Why? Because the record label does not promote JC at all. I still have not see his new video. They promoted Justin like hell but they forgot about JC. It is a shame because the album is good and he deserves to get it heard. It is good.
3,Frontpage 2003,"There seems to be a problem getting Microsoft and Yahoo, my webhosting provider to work together. MS doesn't want to allow the customer to use the custom form pages in Frontpage on a Yahoo site. Does that paradigm sound familiar? Wake up and smell the coffee MS. It was a Yahoo Help desk supervisor that had to come up with the ""mysterious"" code change that made the ""contact us"" form useable."
5,A warrior in blue...,"For those who have an interest in true cop stories, this book is a must. The Chicago Police Department has its own subculture, which Gina depicts so well, however, all cops share the same routine, tedium, moments of incredible action and honor and courage and fear.Her stories are so real, so honest, one can feel their own heartbeat. I am from a police family and what she writes is upfront and real. Don't miss an interesting ride with the Chicago Police."
3,This is okay...,"We purchased this item so that my daughter wouldn't get the glare of the sun in her eyes but the problem with this car shade is that the suction cups don't stick very well to the windows. It comes undone and luckily for us, has never fallen on our daughter.We like the fact that you can adjust the height of the shade but they need to adjust the suction cups so that it stays in place.This product is okay but if you can find something else that will stay in place, we'd recommend that you purchase that instead."
4,A good read!,I enjoy the CD even more after reading this book. The only better read you could get is from someone who was actually there during the making of the album.
3,A New Foundation Myth,"Born In Blood is Robinson's attempt to establish a more believable ""Creation Myth"" of Masonry than the previously accepted ""Egyptian Origins."" Robinson was educated enough to know the previous EO theory was founded upon a erroneous interpretation of Egyptian hieroglyphics (hieroglyphics not being correctly understood till approx 1830 with the decipherment of the Rosetta Stone). Masonry has it's origins in Kaballa, see:RC Series Bundle: The Rosicrucian Enlightenment (Routledge Classics)not the Knights Templar. He writes well, but his history is all wrong."
4,Robinson does his homework.,Born in blood is a wonderfull book on the beginnings of freemasons. Much older then when the first supposed lodge was opened in England in the 1700 are the roots of masons. Robinson Rightly traces it back to Scotland and the Remains of the Templars who where persecuted at the hands of French king Phillip. He does a great job linking the two groups and I know from Masonic ritual that there is traces of the Templars in certain rites. He also goes into there links to the peasent revolt in England and other midevil events in europe after the supposed fall of the Templers that have Masonic influence written all of them. A great book and his history is very well researched. If you are a mason and do not know some back history then this is a great book.
1,Waste of money,"The book is a waste of money. Many of the ""tricks"" are so ridiculous thata three year old is not fooled!"
1,A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,"I've been an MT for 20 years, the last 4 at home, and used the 3rd edition fairly frequently, so really looked forward to the 4th. However, for all its increased number of pages, it leaves a lot to be desired. Just yesterday when looking for a specific brace, checked ""brace"" in ORTHOPEDICS AND SPORTS MEDICINE where I was told to ""see appliance, orthosis, prosthesis and splint"". At appliance, I was told ""see also prosthesis"". Orthosis and splint actually do have lists of specific items -- but not the one I was looking for. That's just one example, but I have encountered several entries like it. I guess I'll just stick with my old, falling apart 3rd edition."
4,Excellent Upgrade,"Microsoft Office FrontPage 2003 sports a new ""Windows XP""-like interface. The major changes to this version, however, occur under the hood.FrontPage 2003 creates cleaner code than any previous version. FrontPage also supports web development technologies such as ASP.NET. FrontPage 2003 is able to create more complex web solutions easier than any previous version.One major drawback to FrontPage is its lack of support for PHP. As PHP becomes more common it is surprising that Microsoft still does not support it natively in FrontPage 2003.FrontPage's more robust code and intuitive interface make it an excellent upgrade."
4,Cute pencils!,"These pencils are really cute and my granddaughters love them. My only complaint is that the patterns look as though they are created for young girls, yet the leads are thin and fragile. I wish Papermate would come up with a mechanical pencil that contains a heavy duty lead for youngsters similar to the sturdier leads used in drafting pencils. Also how about some extra eraser tips in the package? However, what Papermate is selling is the look, and they've done a great job with that."
1,Not worth the money,The mirror is made of a plastic mirror film that is not even glass. This cause the image to be distorted. Also it is too small and suction falls off easily.
1,don't waste your money,"This movie is horrible. boring. not funny. bad acting. really, no redeeming moments whatsoever.Badly written, badly acted. Keep this movie in the '90's Amazon really has to do better with the movie selections. Just lame."
2,So So Knock Off,"This is a well made and well acted effort to update the classic Sherlock Holmes mystery. Despite its positive features, it fails in the end because it doesn't bring anything novel and interesting to the genre. The characters are a virtually a transposition from Conan Doyle and the basic plot idea is lifted from A Scandal in Bohemia."
1,NY Yankee belly ring,The Yankees symbol came out of the belly ring without me even noticing it and I had only worn it for a week.
5,Great toddler book,This is an especially good book for any child who like's Thomas the train. My grandson is 21 months. As soon as you finish reading the story he wants to read it again. He is now recognizing most of the letters in the alphabet. He is also learning colors of the different train engines.
1,Out dated information,"The essays are old works and easily gotten for free through the internet. NBER offers 5 essays a month in a free news letter covering essays on economics, many on the business cycle, unemployment, inflation, trade and labor issues.I was amazed to find not one essay by Geoffrey Moore and vague references to his life's work in a sentence or two during each essay's mundane recounting of the obvious.This book was a big, big disappointment."
4,Great drill,"This drill is great - I didn't know that I had to buy bits for it (it's the first time I bought a drill), but even so - it's worked out great for me - thanks to the others who reviewed this product, you hit the nail on the head!"
2,Problems,"As a part-time contractor, I need something that doesn't waste my time. This drill wastes my time. I don't know if I just have a bad one or what, but the chuck rarely stays tight, it slips with drill bits and comes undone with screwdrivers. I spend 50% of my time fiddling with the chuck. I also have the same trouble as many people, in that it goes from slow to fast instantly, and if you are trying to tighten the chuck it will do everything it can to rip the skin on your hand off. I've spent time trying find some way to steadily increase the speed from slow to medium, but the trigger on mine has no such ability."
2,Entertaining,"For a song whose lyrics are, let's say, ""cryptic"" and are obviously repeated over and over again on the CD...this works. Versions vary widely, the bands appear to have put forth the effort to learn and ""own"" the tune. Favorites are by Polar and Lush. Sharron Krause is creative. Can't strongly recommend this CD because it's mostly mediocre, but if you keep the volume low it's OK to put on repeat, kick back and do some reading/writing/whatever."
5,Beautiful and moving,"I have many Viola da Gamba CDs, but I have to say that this has become my favorite. No other player approaches the emotional intensity of Hille Perl in her expressiveness and lyricism, even moving to tears. Her playing truly brings you to another place. Her passion for her instrument and music touches every selection in this CD. Do your heart a favor, and get this CD. I can't recommend it enough."
2,"Save your money, pass this one by","I can't help but wonder if I saw the same video as those who gave this five stars. When I bought it I was really looking forward to it - in that I have a great many National Geographic Video's, all of which are very good. This one is not up to their standards.The re-enactments are really bad (they look more like Romans rather than bronze age greeks). I was also underwhelmed by the information or lack of."
2,Not worth the money,"The ladder is not at all what we expected. Most parts are flimsy, it doesn't look like it would hold even 200lbs - you can see the stairs and platform ""bend"" when my 10 year old gets on it. The ""frame"" for the Anti-Entrapment Barrier is made so cheap and so are the 2 poles that are part of the ""stand-up"" frame. I don't expect those poles to last long. Ladder is ""wobbely"" and not sturdy at all.Until you read the instructions, nobody tells you that you will need to fill these tiny compartments with sand to keep the ladder from floating - did that - still has a hard time staying on the ground. I guess I should have gone with the ladders that would be filled completely instead. This one was a waste of money!"
3,splash pool,i think the safety feature behind the steps in the pool is very dangerous. A kid can be messing around and get his foot stuck in the bars. Better rethink!!!
4,Should be Java Applet Game Programming for Dummies.,"Covers Java Applet Programming fairly well, but it doesn't give a good description of how to structure the content of your file when programming. The point is, you need an understanding of the basics of Java programming or you will be wondering why your programs aren't compiling. Otherwise it is pretty complete and up to date."
1,Horrible DVD,"This DVD was not what I expected it had scratches on it, it didn't work in my DVD player. It was not a workout DVD, you just watched her dance and that was it. Whoever sent this to me knew that it didn't work I still have received my money back for this DVD either..... Not a happy customer at all"
2,"If you're staying longer than a few days, get a better map","This map would probably be nice for tourists who are *only* going to see the Stadt Mitte around the Tiergarten, Checkpoint Charlie, and the other touristy stuff. However, you can probably get a map that's just as good at this stuff from your hotel for free, save the mini-German lesson that's printed on the map. If you buy the Lonely Planet Berlin handbook, which is probably a better investment, you won't need this map. If you want to see things that aren't the everyday touristy stuff, you need a bigger map. Get one with Postdam on it and buy it when you get to Berlin. You'll save cash and the frustration of having a map that makes Berlin look like a Dorf (small village)."
1,poor service for soldiers,As a soldier in Iraq we don't always have a lot choices to purchase what we want. So alot of us soldiers go online to find what we want and order it. When we find an outfit that won't ship to us we go look somewhere else. Afterwards it gets around to other soldiers where to go to a place that will do business with you.
1,Not what it should be,"Homeschooler, don't waist your time on this book. Very little instruction provided...this book is not even good as a supplement. It does have a few pages of poems for copy work...but you can use any poetry book for that, picture study for narration... but shouldn't a child be doing ""picture study"" anyway? There is one page and a worksheet on paragraphs, one page on letter writing. A few pages each of the very basics like adverbs and adjectives...if you need a book that you can really use, I'd skip this one...""Home school at home"" is very a thorough book..it quickly increases in difficulty and includes much practice, reviews, plenty of opps for writing!And math? o-o-oh yeah."
1,Awful design: pick another one,"Up 'till now, I've always been impressed with DeWalt (price and quality), but this drill . . . is a different story. The chuck on this needs a major redesign; it's almost impossible to get it tight enough. If you're drilling metal, or using round shaft bits, DO NOT BUY THIS DRILL. It works fine as a screw driver (and with other hex shaped bits), however drilling 1/8"" pilot holes in 14ga sheet metal: bad idea. The chuck just slips on the drill bit. I'd recommend any other DeWalt drill, as long as it's got a standard keyed chuck."
1,Someone at Dewalt Should be Punished...,... for the horrible no name unusable keyless chuck on this drill. You MUST wear gloves to get a grip on it. No way to get a bit out if the drill is unplugged. Just got a refurb Hitachi D10vhr drill on Amazon that smokes this drill in every category.
5,a must read,I've read this book twice and LOVE reading about the BUDS experience. Anyone considering a move into the Special Operations community should read this book cover to cover.
2,Liked at first -- Addendum after months!,I own a Kodak Professional Dye Sub printer. The output on this printer is like my Kodak. I like it because it is quick and easy for a 4x6 print. It comes out perfect - no cutting or trim necessary. It has a very small foot print - the cord holders are arranged very well. Drivers worked well - even when networked. Highly recommended. Very fast. Yes the Kodak is a little better but a lot more expensive. One would be hard to tell the difference.Addendum afer owinig 6 months!! - As I use this printer - I am not as pleased - a lot of detail missing - some problems with muddy colors. Generally not pleased!
1,Bulb did not work.,"Tried the bulb in 3 brand new fixtures and would not come on in any. Faulty from the start, wasted my $$$$."
4,Chain Mail Shirt & Hood,"The first shipment evidently got lost in the mail- how ironic :)! Good communication & customer support though, and eventually I got the suit. It definitely meets my needs & expectations. I teach junior high world history, and wanted to give a tactile feel & touch to our lessons about Medieval times, the Crusades, etc.. This set weighs a full 30 lbs., which is pretty accurate. It's obviously not of ""handmade"" quality, but very nice for the price."
3,Does not fit thick doors,"I too could not use this product because I have 3/4 inch doors. It does not work if your door is thick. I love the idea of these, but they will not work for me."
2,"Does not work on our 3/4"" doors","My cabinet door is 3/4"" thick, and after properly installing the lock, I was dismayed to find that the magnet will not open it. The door is too thick for the magnet to have enough pull, but too thin for us to use the extention magnet.I tried both locks from the package, and neither worked. I even accidentally drilled all the way through the door, so there is no wood in between the lock and the magnetic key, however the key still can not open the lock.The locks do work when they're not installed in the door, but once they are installed there is too much space and wood in between the magnets. I wanted to post this as a warning to anyone with similar-sized doors; if your door is a little too narrow for using the extention magnet, you may have problems."
2,annoyed,"Loved the idea of a magnetic lock system, but the design is not robust enough. I am fairly handy but installation was frustrating. I tried no less than 3 times very carefully aligning the provided template, drilling, carefully tightening all the screws only to find that the lock mechanism did not engage perfectly and the door popped open with a little pull. The magnet part worked fine with the extension, that was not the problem. Adjusting the catch forward and back, I could not get the latch part to seat properly and if it is off by a few degrees it will collapse and fail to lock the cabinet. I am trying another manufacturer to see if their magnet system is a little easier to install."
2,Impractical for for thicker cabinet doors,"This product might work well if you have thin cabinet doors, but we have found that the magnets provided don't work very well in our kitchen. It's a really cumbersome system in any event, so much so that when I'm in a hurry I have to leave some of the cabinets open which defeats the purpose. It requires two hands and patience to get the door open with this system. In retrospect I wish we'd used this method just for the few cabinets that have dangerous chemicals or medicine in them and used the latch system for the other doors."
1,Not user friendly,"The concept of this product is very good; but the installation is not user friendly. Perhaps it would be easier if the instructions were a little clearer. I like to think of myself as a pretty handy person, but not with these gadgets. I actually gave up and will be returning the item."
3,"can't buy lock ""key"" on line","Why is it that they don't carry the starter lock set that contains two ""keys""? If this is the best product they should carry key's that can be purchased"
3,Very Irritating Woman!,"The dance steps are actually broken down pretty well, but the instructor woman is so annoying it makes the video difficult to watch. She's an older woman who makes cutesy, pukey remarks throughout the whole thing that makes you wanna barf."
4,Good but needs work.,"I also am a law school student and am using this software instead of Word to create my outlines. I have noticed some things that are missing. For example: No find and replace, limited autocorrect functionality, no save as (backup is automated and somewhat limited), no support for inserting Tables. Everyday I find something new.... Also, you can't easily see the formatting, so every once in a while I end up with a 1 inch wide column of text that I cannot correct.The interface is really nice and I love having all my notes in one place and organized by tabs. I'm using it on a normal laptop and find it helpful, but like someone above, I think in it's current state it's only worth $30-50, Not $200."
2,Didn't work for me.,"It is not compatable with older versons of OneNote. My fault, I didn't do my home work. It is fine otherwise."
3,Stiff operation,"I gave this tool as a gift, and noticed that it did not have the ease of operation in the one handed function I have experienced on similiar tools."
2,disappointing,"Don't be fooled by the name of Jill Barklem on the cover. Nor the story nor, alas, the illustrations are by her. Therefore this book doesn't belong in the same league as the other Brambly Hedge books.Drawings lack the same detail of the original Barklem artwork."
1,Toooo much conversations!!!!,"I rented this game 2 days ago, and was trying to play, but I couldn't because only thing you do here is listning to conversations. It is same like watching a movie, but sometimes you can play for 10 seconds.Be carefull; if you die you have to wait another 10 minutes to play it again.Plus to many downloads!Do not buy this game it dosn't worth your many."
3,A lot of trouble for a lot of money,"It is difficult to set up for use, especially in the car where one is most likely to use it. If it is not setup and on your ear, you have to put the phone down (if you received a call) and spend 20 to 30 seconds getting it turned on, and on your ear, then the call may get dropped. Regardless of the claims, the batteries don't stay charged very long. You must remember to shut it off properly or it gets worse. You would think for the money they would include a car charger. It does work well after you get it going, butI think the simpler ones with wires are more straight forward."
4,Hard to find this in the store,"I was glad to get this because it's been hard for me to find sugar-free lime jello in the store. Ever since my glucose intolerance was diagnosed, I've missed many dishes. Finally, I can once again serve and enjoy the lime jello and pear halves salad topped with a mixture of greek yogurt, splenda, and cholesterol free Hellmans, with that layer topped off with shredded colby-jack or cheddar cheese. Yum! Of course, I'm always hoping for the price to lower, as in most of my purchases."
5,A must for Internet Marketing,"This is the very first book I started reading to understand Internet Commerce subject. After I opened the book, I kept it down only after finished reading the book. This book gives a lot of real life examples to support the 9 essential principles the author is discussing about. The author gives both positive and negative examples why a particular web-site was a hit or a failure. A must read for anyone planning to put a business web site."
5,Extremely intelligent and insightful,Webonomics covers a wide assortment of cutting-edge topics by thoroughly explaining the ins and outs of web culture. It has served as a great reference and learning tool. This book was a great compliment to an internet marketing course that I have recently taken.
2,"Dated, Sloppy Thinking","This book is too old to be valuable to anyone who is serious about taking their business to the web. It seems to ignore the real marketing techniques that work and the economic consequences of a bad strategy. Schwartz's conclusion plays into popular thinking about the web introducing chaos into marketing, rather than recognizing that the marketplace is merely speeding up."
3,A fairly good book but...,I agree with a previous reviewer that Webonomics is about ideas rather than action. The reviewer also said you should get another book that covers practical issues and states Increase Your Web Traffic (in a Weekend) is the book you should get. I was a bit skeptical never having heard of the book but I decided to check it out and discovered to my delight that it is true. Read Webonomics to get ideas. Read Increase Your Web Traffic for the practical handson issues you'll need to succeed.
2,Don't bother,"I bought this book from Amazon after reading the other kudos(below). I really thought it would be ""all that"". Well, itisn't. It gives you a little insight into some experiences of others, but is hardly worth the time to sit through the 217 pages to find it out. Most of it is common sense."
4,Great starter book for understanding diabetes,I am not diabetic but was looking for a book to learn about diabetes. This book had just the right level of physiology for me as well as the right level of detail for explaining the various strategies that diabetics use to manage their disease. I gave my first copy to a colleague and will order more copies for me and anyone who asks for a reference.
1,Unacceptable,The book I received was published in 1996; the one I expected was published in 2011. This not Amazon's fault; it is their associate dealer. Amazon has corrected the problem to my satisfaction. I think they should review their relationship with this supplier and consider droppingn them.
5,Diabetic Serenity,"I, being newly diagnosed and totally ignorant to diabetes, found this book to be a wonderful introduction to the disease. Taking much of the fear from treatment, this book has enlightened my otherwise dismal thoughts regarding diabetes."
4,American Diabetes Assoc....,Helpful - it has lots of good info in it - I liked it that it is the most recent printing of this resource.
3,Diamond pendant,The pendant was much smaller than I had anticipated. I did not read any details before ordering. The workmanship was also disappointing.
4,Great monopod for large video cameras.,"I have a super lightweight version of this that I was trying to replace before it falls apart and thought this was exactly what I needed. Unfortunately it was too big and too heavy for my Sony camcorder. That is the only reason I dropped a star, but to be fair, that was as much my fault as the manufacturer as I didn't read the specs close enough."
2,What Version Are You Looking For?,That is the first thing that you should ask? This book is for osCommerce V2.2MS2 and for this does a very good job. It also does a very good job of giving an overview of the osCommerce process and layout of things. But it does not work for osCommerce V2.2RC2a. This version is just different enough that the steps that are outlined do not work. Now that osCommerce V2.3 and v3.0 are on the horizon this book is even more out of date.
3,Good Beginner's manual,"I didn't purchase the Beginner's manual, but I think this Professional Edition could be called a Beginner's guide. It worked pretty well to get me started as I'm not a programmer and had never really used osCommerce. Due to the title, I was expecting to get a little more information on the coding aspect.POSITIVES - for beginners, it gives you a good overall idea of site structure and is written in language that anybody can understand. It suggests several add-ons to incorporate and shows you how to install them as well as provides hints on some of the customization.NEGATIVES - I was hoping for something with a little more depth on the programming level.Overall, I think this is a great book for a beginner who has never worked with osCommerce and has little experience with php & mysql. However, if you want something that will guide you in creating your own custom modules, I think you should look elsewhere."
5,good value,nice kit with a good selection of starter tools including a 3-jaw keyless chuck. detented speed control maintains selected speed. well packaged.
1,not as good as I was hoping,"I bought this for my husband who was less than thrilled by it. I used it a few times and it worked okay. The packing case was a big dissapointment, very poorly designed and one of the cutting tools arrived broken which was not surprising considering how poorly they were packed. I was happy when my husband finally took it out to use it and it died halfway through the job. Just stopped working for no apparent reason. Let's hope the warrenty is better than the tool. Update: I sent the product to the manufacturer to get it fixed or replaced. I had given up hope of ever seeing anything returned after more than 6 months of waiting when finally a package came with the replacement for it. Very, Very slow response!!"
3,not a great product,"this product is good for ""art and craft"" projects (most of the accessories for wood polish). Returned the product back to amazon."
3,medio disgustado,The only(unique) thing that I cannot stand is haver received the discs that are for pulir broken
1,poor quality feeder,The feeder clock does not work well and totally sends the feeder off at different times then intended. I have purchased three in the last two years and have had the same problem with all of them. The feeder is relatively cheap but it does not meet the rigors of going year round in rough weather.
3,text is great but visually...,"Though I love Ted Andrews' work and writing, I was disapointed by the images on the cards themselves. I don't mind the photographs, it's the distracting fussy borders and tight oval shapes that frame the pictures of each animal, not to mention the over abundance of writing around the edges. I am a visually oriented person, and unfortunatly these factors really ruin the whole oracle for me. But for someone who is not affected by these things, it's probably a fantastic deck."
4,Very different way of working with the Tarot,I was very impressed with the Animal Wise Tarot as I have many of Ted Andrews books and his deck of tarot cards is truly a different way to do Tarot. It can also help you get in touch with the animal spirits/totems that are working in your life at the time you do your readings. This is a great deck to work with. Anyone who is interested in animal and wants more than just an animal oracle this is the one to get.
4,snappy!,"James' opening of the book is very inspiring. He's like just do it, just get ink to paper, or whatever your medium, and do it!"
4,The Great Horn Men,"Actually I bought this collection because I wanted to hear the great King Cole Trio (Nat Cole, piano, Oscar Moore, guitar and Johnny Miller, bass, back up Benny Carter, Willie Smith, Charlie Parker and Lester Young. Unfortuntely the CD did not include Young and the trio performing ""These Foolish Things"" and ""Lester Leaps In."" But the trio is in top form accompanying the three alto saxophonists. Just the appearance of the trio is enough to make me purchase any CD. So I recommend just because the King Cole Trio is part of it.Mercury Man from White Plains, Westchester County, New York"
4,Editorial description is incorrect,"This is a pretty darn good CD...not sure what someone was smoking with that Product Description up above, as it has nothing to do with this CD. These were songs done by Stan Bush, best known for his work on Transformers, the Movie... he has an upbeat, 80s style to him much like Bryan Adams. Definately recommended."
5,The Best Book I've seen on Ki Development,"I've been an aikido student & teacher for over a decade. Much of the material in this book has been passed from teacher to teacher for some time, but, as far as I know, this is the first time it has been writen down.This is an good introduction to Ki Development for a beginer, and a great source book for a teacher."
2,skeptical,"I find it hard to believe that some of the reviewers here have chosen to state that the author ""is telling the truth"". How would we ever know? He got the diaries from Harry Nielson,why did he have them? Something Mr G fails to document in his ""thoroughly researched"" book. Is is a coincidence that he wrote this book after Harry Nielson had died? As previous reviewers have mentioned, there are many contradictions in the work as well. Lennon had an uncontrollable libidio, but was also impotent??? I think that the truth lies somewhere between the author's presentation and the near mythic qualities attributted to John Lennon. I am actually sorry that I even read the book, the truth be told."
3,I can see a pattern here......,"The most common technique for biographers who wants to attack ""Great Men"", at least for the last 30 years, has been to accuse them of being ""Gay"". Alexander The Great, Caesar, Jesus, the apostle Paul, Charles The Great, Fredrick The Great, Peter The Great, the explorers Burton, Stanley, Cecil Rhodes are just a few of the historical ""Great Men"" who has been accused of being homosexuals recently. Of course these ""Gay""-accusations have no shock-value these days, and frankly: Does it matter?Geoffrey Guiliano has written books about McCartney and Harrison too. These too are full of unpleasent accusations. We can clearly see a pattern here. Maybe Guiliano is really unconsiously writing about himself.Take Care, Mats"
1,"Filthy, disgusting garbage","Giuliano is a well-known Beatles fanatic who decided to write an extended poison pen bio. He claims to have tapes or copies of John Lennon's diaries, but can't explain why his interpretation of the diaries seem VERY different than other people who really have seen them, and he claims that his copy of the diaries were given to him by someone who probably didn't have them. This book is poorly written, seems rushed to press in time to beat _Anthology_ and doesn't offer anything more than a bunch of unsuspported and ridiculous assumptions. Giuliano, for his part, claims to be telling the truth because he ""sits on a throne"" and because ""people worship"" him, as he said in an interview in a Buffalo NY newspaper. So why would he lie? I dunno, because the combination of money, arrogance and nuttiness is a difficult combination to live honestly by maybe."
1,You can always blame the dead,"This book looks like rubbish knowing that : 1) it's based upon Fred Seasman memories (Seasmen was jailed for stealing Lennon & Ono properties) 2) memories of reading of John's diaries (what a reliable information) 3) you can always blame dead people, they won't answer youLike Albert Goldman or Steven Gaines, this author simply exploit John death."
3,The Real Lost Lennon Years?,"Giuliano's research into John Lennon's post-Beatle years is at once compelling and nasty -- not unlike a car accident you both wish you hadn't seen, yet still wonder if you could have had a better view. Lurid, often sloppy (dates are mixed up; Lennon supposedly dreams of Madonna in the late seventies, years before her first album even appeared), yet no Grossmanesque butcher job. Giuliano obviously cares deeply for his subject, but doesn't seem to really know how to balance Lennon's innate contradictions. Photos of Lennon during '75-80 rarely show a less than healthy ex-Beatle; yet Giuliano would have us believe he was a sickly malnourished neurotic heroin addict who kicked babies wives and mistresses in his spare time. Still, an intriguing book. Can't put it down, can't help but wonder about Lennon's last years -- yet at the same time terribly doubtful about this book's supposedly ""accurate"" resources."
1,What Rock Did This Guy Crawl Out From Under?,"This book reads like poorly written fiction, and there is a heck of lot better fiction out there then this. It obviously doesn't take a lot to write and publish a book. How many times is John Lennon going to be killed? It's a shame every library across the country will circulate this on their shelves. Geoffrey Giuliano is scary. This poor guy needs a job. What is this his third Beatles tome. Do yourself a favor and just enjoy the MUSIC."
3,Sadly True,"Having had a passing meeting with Lennon in the early 70s, the description of this fascinating man rings true. Giuliano isn't a great writer by any means, and I would have liked to see footnotes or at least references to where he got this info, but the substance is undoubtedly true. Not enough about Lennon's last weeks, however. But he was the first one to report things that got trumpeted in the Rosen book that has made such a splash. I woudln't buy it ( ), but it is ver interesting."
1,Very Unhappy,"After paying for this item on Feb 28, I still have not received it as of today, April 10. I am very very unhappy with this purchase and will not purchase from this seller again. I have never had this experience at Amazon before."
4,Good visual Book,If you need a nice visual book this is a good one. I found to be easy to read and understand
5,absolutley awesome and indepth book on DOS!,"To be blunt ive read many books on DOS since ,well since DOS has been around. The author of this book is awesome and clear and precise in the way he explores the world of DOS and the Operating System itself. Thanx amazon."
1,dated and not well written,I did not rec'd current version. Mine copy writed 1986. Author technical and very detailed. Like he was arguing with someone. Not easy read. Not worth it.
1,Accessory Combs Break,"I've used this clipper set to cut my husband's for a couple of years with success, but over time all of the comb attachments have broken. Cheaply designed plastic parts. This kit is billed as an at-home set, not for professionals. I'm not a pro and needed those combs to get the right cut. So having all of them break has rendered the entire set useless. No sense trying to replace the combs at Remington; they don't appear to carry parts anymore for this model. The parts and shipping are so expensive, I might as well buy a whole new set. Disappointed in cheap, plastic-y junk."
2,Did not work for me.,"I had the same rate of muscle growth from consuming protein alone than with this. My strength was increasing less, but I can't really blame this product. It's natural to decrease the rate of speed your strength increases as you near your body's potential. But Cell-Tech didn't help as far as I can tell. I'm actually disappointed with the brand as a whole. I've tried their Nitro-Tech, Cell-Tech, and Nano Vapor, and haven't seen, measured, or felt any noticeable results. The only positive thing I can think of is their pretty packaging. Definitely not worth the bang for the buck. Every body reacts differently. Mine seems to dislike Musletech products."
1,not even once,"dat dere cell tech should never be taken by anyone, you will get too big too fast your family will disown you and you will never have any friendseverCELL TECHNOT EVEN ONCE"
5,Quick increase in strength,"This product has performed great for me. I love the grape flavor, it tastes just like kool aid. I skipped the loading stage and just took one serving per day, and have seen a big increase in strength and stamina. My bench went from 145-185 max in about 5 weeks. Also, was struggling curling 60 lbs. 10 times, now do 3 sets of 80 lbs.Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to get stronger fast. No downsides to this product!"
4,Prodigious research,"This is not a book that can be read in any linear fashion. For the average lay reader it is primarily useful for the wonderful black-and-white photographs of members of almost every one of the 150 tribes described. And if you want to attend a special event of a particular tribe, the book will have that too. Otherwise, after 10 pages of straight reading, I was just overwhelmed with facts, figures and details, plus locations for which there was no corresponding map in the book, a real detriment, I think. Yes, there is a map showing the areas that the various tribes inhabited, but with no relation to present day locations at all. For the Pacific Northwest Indian student, this should definitely take a place on bookshelves as a reference tool. But for average folk, perhaps one of the many suggested readings would be more appropriate. A great overall encyclopedia of the tribes."
5,Simple. Easy to use.,This is simple and easy to use. A very basic product that fills a need. It works like it should.
4,Good headphones + Great microphone,"These headphones are fairly comfortable, as other users have mentioned. As superaural headphones, they do little to block out ambient noise, but if that's not a concern, they work excellently. Sound reproduction is accurate, with great bass especially. The microphone is very impressive as well. With built in noise-cancelling technology they cut ambient noise in recordings. I tested this product against the one-ear headset PC 120 (also by Sennheiser) and as expected, the sound quality was much higher. I was surprised, though, how much clearer the recorded audio was. Thirty seconds worth of adjustments and I was making crisp, clear audio recordings, with quality unmatched by any microphones I've owned before. Great product Sennheiser!"
3,pretty good,"This is good for a debut album, even though i'm not a big hardcore fan this band manages to put some new elements in the the hcore realm of music.By having more melodies,and solo's(even though the solos are a bit to technical for this tpye of music).Bout the only complaint i would have is the singer and the production,the singer strains to much it seems to scream his head off,when in fact his voice sound good when he just sings with a little agression.I've seen many singers myself fall by the wayside from to much screaming.The problem with the production is that it has no depth,or its tiny sounding.But other than that the music is great,maybe just a tad bit faster on another album.But not bad."
2,This cd SUCKS,"The only good part is the music but all the songs start soundthing the same as the last, but I would still like this cd a lot more if the singer was better. His scream sucks and is horribly annoying. One song I recall he actually tried to sing and that was just horrible. I heard the samples on here and I thought they sounded great but it sounded different to me on the cd. Download a song then judge it."
2,"Good guitars,bad singing","I've been a fan of prosthetic records bands for a while now, Lamb Of God being my favorite.So when i heard Chris Adler took a new band under his wing i thought i'd give them a listen.Well it was not very much to my liking other than the guitar work,the vocalist needs training,he sounds to much like phil anselmo only he trys to hard.Also whats with everyone liking this type of so called math music or whatever,there is no depth to this stuff and it gets very boring,very fast.I don't see what LOG thought was so great about this band.Also the drums sound like they were recorded with a 4 track and sound to paperish,the only thing this album has of interest are the guitars which some people may or may not like and the solos are a bit to rock and rollish for my taste.But enough about this band...buy LOG's new one its RAW and dark and as always heavy as hell."
1,Overrated...,"This album was absolutely awful.The ""singing"" was utterly putrid, and these guys owe Pantera some royalties for those ""screams"". (and I'm no Pantera fan)The one guy that said the drums sounded papery, and the album sounded as if on recorded on a 4-track, hit the nail on the head. That is the perfect description.Save your money and get the new Suffocation CD."
5,Fantastic!,"This product is great. It's not super easy to install (each lock requires 6 screws plus one hole in the door). If you take your time, ready the instructions, plan it out, and execute; it works great. You have to be patient. Each door took me 5 to 10 minutes. In less than 1 hour I was able to unpack, read instructions, plan, get my tools, and have it done in 4 doors. I think it won't work with hollow doors or maybe doors that are too thick but mine were pretty standard.I love how it's hidden and pretty sturdy due to having a bunch of screws holding it. The adhesive ones are easy to install but I bet my son would open them in no time."
5,I should have gotten these to start with,"I had originally gone for inexpensive with a different type of childproof lock. Needless to say, I had more problems opening the drawers and cabinets than my daughter did. We were moving into a new home so I went ahead and got these...In fact i could have prevented damaged drawers on her wardrobe (she opened and climbed in them to empty her clothing out) if I had done this from the start.These work great. We found it better to buy 3 complete sets so we had 3 keys to work with."
1,Extremely Hard to Install,"First of all...these are a fantastic idea. My wife and I were so excited to get these installed in our home, and have something that doesn't always show considering how many ""baby"" related things always clutter the house!The first process in installing is quite simple...follow the grid that is provided...drill holes...and you are basically done. Well, that is where the trouble for us began. First, our cabinets are 3 years old, 3/4 of an inch thick, and no matter what we did, the magnet was not strong enough.There are two extensions provided, one for a little extra room, and the other that if I used it, it would go through my entire cabinet. Option one, was still no good...not strong enough.So, our only option is to go see if there is another ""metal"" piece that I can buy from a hardware store to stick in and use instead of their extension pins. This has really been a pain, and if they would have better instructions this probably could be easily avoided."
5,He's still got it...,"After all these years Juno Reactor is still able to bring something new to the trance plate and not repeat himself. Labyrinth is full of tribal beats, ethnic vocals and oddly enough - a touch of rock and drum & bass. Throw in the unmistakable Juno Reactor trance beats from time to time and you've got one damn good CD.You'll notice this album has a much more cinematic and epic feel to it then previous albums... Ben Watkins truly is a master at what he does and continues to evolve and change."
5,Suffering and the Sovereignty of God questions,"Like Jeremiah who deals with suffering, Mr. Tabbs book is wonderful in helping us search for understanding through the pains of life. His advice and wisdom are encouraging and the questions that he asks througout the book are what everyone of us is asking on the inside but Tabb as the bolness to verbalize and wrestle with. This book stretched my soul and strengthened my relationship with God. I have read a lot of books on suffering and this is the best. It is honest, God honoring and helpful, in walking through the variety of trials that people face. Praise God for a real and great book on suffering. I will buy many to give to those who are wrestling through life. - Chris Trent"
2,Not as brilliant as advertised,"Although a few of the tunes are compelling, I cannot recommend this. I like psyche (soft, or trippy) and this one doesn't have that special love of fuzzed out guitars and halcyon ambience that the best of this genre offers. It seems a bit too casual and lazy for my tastes. I don't detect a lot of passion on this. Sorry."
1,Bad Example,"My 5 year old and I have been enjoying reading novels together and she loved Ramona the Pest by Beverly Cleary and so I was looking for something that might be similar. However, with this book...I couldn't get past the first 3 pages without having to omit the name calling and attitude so much that there was nothing left to read. I paused after a few pages, looked at my daughter and said ""this doesn't seem like a very nice book does it? Should we start something else?"" and she agreed."
2,"Buy Tracks, Not Album","I heard ""Falling Upstairs"" in a clip, and thought, ""I like Fastball, I like how this song sounds, I'm buying the album."" I wasn't very impressed with the album overall. There were maybe two or three songs I enjoyed, but for the most part I just moved ""Falling Upstairs"" to my MP3 player and that's the only time I hear anything from this album."
3,Simplfied Form of Review,"5 simple words: Great Product, but TOO expensive. It is very hard for all people to pay $300+ on this product. I would recommend it though if you could afford it.Gets 5 stars for product itselfGets 1 star for the cost-value.Average = 3 stars"
5,Book collector,"I received this book just as it was described. I was trying to find a duplicate of a cookbook I was given by my mother-in-law years ago.. which I passed on to my son. This isn't the exact one, but it's close. Good purchase."
3,Tell My Story Movin' my review from barcelona,"A good record when he had suffered a minor stroke and hadn't regained full fitness, consequently his singing is somewhat strained and he plays guitar on only one track but he compensates by playing lots of harmonica in the style of prime Little Walter, by this legend of Chicago Blues that was a founder member of the great THE ACES. Personally I like very much the 1978 jewel record ""I'm a southern man"" that this ""Tell my story movin' but this one also reaches great Chicago Blues moments along with all CD, all the songs have a good similar level and if you like Chicago Blues you can go wrong with it."
2,Let's just lump all people together tripe,"Why men don't Iron. My dad was a marine and was proud to teach all 4 of his sons to iron. Not only that, he made sure we took iron supplements.I'll think I'll write a book entitled, ""Why all women authors are stupid."""
2,Tried so hard to like it...,"As a big fan of Trigiani, I didn't hesitate to buy her latest. What a disappointment! Can't help but agree with a fellow reviewer who said that it would have been better if the main character had been written as a woman. I'm sorry, but I spent the whole time wondering if 'B' was ever going to come out of the closet! Not to mention the endless details on interior decorating. I know from past reads that Trigiani throws in a recipe or two, but this book had too many - it seemed like a cookbook at times. I found myself anticipating the next book I would choose from my shelf if I could just get through this one. But alas, being a Trigiani ""loyalist,"" I will await her next book and keep my fingers crossed."
2,disappointing,"I have read all of Ms Trigiani's other books, even bought them on tape to listen to in the car. Without any hsesitation I purchased this one. darn!--guess they can't all be winners. :*(That this book took place in the early '70's did not come through clearly. B seemed so stereotypical gay with all his references to detail, color, food, etc, yet Ms Trigiani went to great lengths to make sure he was a hot blooded male. This was a bit schizo and did not work for me. The detailed descriptiions, after a while, seemed like so much filler so I began to skip them. I have not yet met a man who is straight who sees like that and talks like that and emotes like that all the time as B did.I did like the receipes and the family interactions. They were fun, silly and a bit outré. I will wait untilt her next book is published to make any broader conclusions."
4,tekton by mit rubber mallet,only 32 oz but heavy and it will take time doing what I need to do with it. durable
1,another disappointment,"I ordered this item to match the earrings also offerred. Again, this product was such a disappointment! I love Swarovski crystal, so I expected the same quality one would expect, given the reputation. However, it looks like a very poor imitation. It is so ugly that I could not even give it away without embarassment!!"
1,Swarovski?,Unhappy with purchase. I should've known by the price. I collect Swarovski crystal. The disc looked good in the pictures but...
4,Good Everyday Pendant,This pendant I classify as the best for casual wear. I wear on the weekends or out & about but isn't not suited for my work or my going out events
2,Pooper Scooper,Not what I expected . This scooper is somewhat cumbersome. Need two hands to operate. I don't like it. I have another one that is much simpler to use (one hand)and easier to empyt (just remove and dispose of the bag.
3,stereo or 5.1,"I,ve got a set of Zalman 5.1 Hphones that are aging but I don,t ever want to go back to stereo HP.s. However I see nowhere on here if these support 5.1 dolby sound?"
4,Great in their price range.,"These Senns are comprotable, have passable sound quality, and have a really great sounding microphone. The noise cancelling works well even in a fairly noisey room. This is the third set I have purchased (for myself, and relatives). I have never had a single issue with them. They are a step up from the 130s but only in comfort. Enjoy them!"
3,Beware of some biased commentaries,I loved this Bible when I first bought it and would have given it 5 stars then. But after 10 months I realized that I don't agree with several commentaries in the book. Most of the comments are well-balanced and give the reader several different views to choose from. However I've run across several comments I've scratched through in my Bible and written above it. For instance it says the reader can't claim the promises of the psalms and proverbs. It also spiritualizes away the meanings of some scriptures that change the God promised meaning. Also it seems to avoid topics I'd like to see comments on. Just keep an open mind with this Bible. On the whole I love the book and still use it every night. But in the future I want a different study Bible.
3,Make sure you read the description...,"This item is for ONE magnet not the TWO shown in the photo. These are a great product, just a deceptive photo."
4,Bleak film,"Don't watch this expecting some light entertainment. Here, we plunge into a gray landscape somewhere in post-Communist eastern Europe. The architecture is brutalist. The ground is muddy and wet. The sky is gray. The people are washed out, bored, psychotic, repressed, angry. We never quite know exactly the meaning of many scenes, but that is part of the challenge and the charm of this foreign film. Threads of storylines follow several characters as they search for some type of meaning or validation in their empty lives. One man beds scores of women. Another older man tries to seduce a young child, or does he? An upscale couple argue. The soundtrack is fantastic, a major plus, in that it complements what goes on on the screen."
2,Its ok,"I liked the texture, but when you rub it on it feels REALLY cold. It actually took my breath away!"
4,Wysard,Engaging from the beginning. I really enjoyed the main character. It was a surprise to find this book. So glad I read it.
4,Not a bad blade for the price,"I had 2 granite countertops I needed to cut down to fit my bathroom vanities, After discovering what the local granite companies would charge me to make these cuts I decided to try it myself.I purchased one of these Dry cut 7"" turbo blades, installed it in my $39.99 skil saw and went to town.The blade cut the granite surprizingly well, It does get the saw hot rather quickly but if you make your cuts slow and easy and allow ample time in between cuts for your saw and blade to cool down this blade will get the job done and save you a lot of $$$$."
2,ehh its cheap,"It was cheap and so I went with it. Like another person posted, the diameter of the hole for the saw was slightly off and required a bit of work to get it to even go on the saw. It also didn't last as long as thought it would have and after about 8 cuts it was about worthless. I ended up going to Lowes and buying a SkillSaw brand diamond blade for 4 dollars more and it has already exceeded this one.Overall, if you need a blade to make a couple cuts and you want to save a few bucks, then this one might work for you after a bit of fine tuning."
3,watch is fine; watchband not,The watch arrived without instructions how to adjust the watchband which has extra links and is quite large. The prongs attaching the links are very weak and with the watch being too large got twisted up and broke. Quite surprised by this mess as the watch looked to be of high quality.
1,Incest Ruined Book,The beginning of the book was good. The violence didn't bother me. I expected violence in a werewolf book. The incest took me completely by surprise and was an absolutely disgusting edition to the story. It was not needed at all. It did nothing to add to the plot. It was unnecessary and turned me off all other books by this P. D. Cacek
1,I wish i never bought it,"I decided to give Canyons a chance after reading the back flap. It had an interesting premise, and I love horror books, especially with a romantic twist ....what completely grossed me out was all the incest. The main character, Lucius, not only has children with his mother, but has sex with his daughters as well. ..it literally made the bile rise in my throat."
3,No better than the cheap ones,I have used a few of these now and they don't seem to be any better than the cheaper ones available at HD or Lowes.
1,Would not recommend,"This watch is quit difficult to read because there is little contrast between the face and hands. Additionally, it just quit working after a month and a half. I have several other Seikos and none have been as troublesome as this one."
2,Deceived by item's PICTURE!...,"Cheap Gold Plating.It looks faded,and not like a real Seiko quality type WATCH.I am sorry to have to keep it, in the same ""CHERRYWOOD AND CLEAR (FORTY)(40) WATCH GLASS CASE"" together with all my other ""BEAUTIFULL"" TIMEPEACES. Maybe it is to be used under a long slee shirt, and jacket so that nobody can see it!... SEIKO shame on you."
3,Received wrong book,"Sent me the wrong book that I needed by a certain time. However, they did replace the book and paid for shipping for the correct book and the return postage for the wrong book."
5,"Sensuality, eroticism and hedonism at their best ...","A classic in Victorian Literature the books title comes from the name of a park Cremorne Gardens in Chelsea England at the turn of the century. As such the park was full of Bohemians and lust seekers that the even had a magazine that is now extremely rare 'The Cremorne' ....Like all good things that must come to an end the town council closed the park and the Cremornites had to go underground ....Underground they hid and this book details the exploits of the Cremornites. Page for page it has more sex and fun than ANY other book that I have ever read ... How the author managed to maintain my interest is incredible .... And of course thats the fun in eroticism isn't it .... So of the 237 pages in the book I would say that 220 are pure, well you know what ..... Fabulous ...."
5,Great Little Book,This book is small but packed full of useful information. I would definitely recommend it.
3,Not sent in package.,I was sent 3 cartridges without Epson packaging. It was in Epson cartridges and vacuum sealed. However it makes me uneasy using product that is not in the cartridge packaging. I would have preferred to have this information available in the description ahead of time.**Month later: the ink does work and so far we haven't had any issues.
1,A disapointment,"If you're looking for a DVD that will help you learn some basic simple party dances, don't buy this one. Although the dances are simple, the DVD does not do a good job of teaching the steps. The ""learn the steps"" section is too slow to be helpful and the actual dance section moves the camera off the feet so often that it's difficult to learn from them either. As one friend said: ""This makes me feel like I can't dance, and I know that's not true!"""
2,Embarassing!,"I bought this tape to teach my 4th grade students a dance for their annual dance concert. The video is almost embarassing. The dances are very repetitive, basically the same 4 or 8 count moves over and over and over and over. And some dances only have steps, with no arm movements. The songs are slowed down, which might be good for learning, but they are so slow that they are boring. My students definetly gave all of these dance a thumbs down, and I don't blame them!"
2,Really hard to open,"I haven't been taking these long enough to know what the effect on my cholesterol will be, but opening them is bound to increase my blood pressure. Separating the foil wrapper which clings tight to the caramel is a real challenge. There is no easy way to do it. It's too bad. The taste is not bad but the packaging is so annoying I won't reorder."
1,Benecol Chews,This product is a huge disappointment. The chews taste awful. No wonder it is impossible to buy these in stores.
2,Taste is ok but texture is yucky,"My doctor wants me on statins but I think the possible side effects areworse than the cholesterol the drugs treat. These chews sound like a great idea. The taste is ok - not great but ok. However, the texture is yucky. One reviewer said waxy but to me it's more like slimey and the slimey feeling stays after the chew is gone. I've only had a few so farand I really don't know if I can make it through the bag much less order them again. The chews may lower cholesterol but only if you can tolerate them and I don't think I'll be able to do that. I think the company needs to rework the formula. It's back to the drawing board for me.Amazon's service was great (as it usually is). They came fast and in perfect condition so it's only the product that I'm complaining about.I just had another one and actually I'm not too happy with the taste either."
1,rapper impossible to open,"The soft chews are in a silver foil, it is extremely difficult to unwrap them and would be near impossible for disabled, oldperson to unwrap thus making the product essentially useless for most people who are in need of loweing their cholesterol"
4,works pretty good,My doctor recommended these for me and she is happy with the results my blood work has shown. They taste good also.
5,"Awesome product, Awesome results","Benecol Smart Chews, Caramel, 120 Soft ChewsThis product does exactly what it claims to do. I used it according to directions for 3 months and my cholesterol went from 256 to 199. I am still using this product and am hoping that soon it will be available in the local stores. I have told everyone I know about this product, my pharmacist is amazed in the way it has worked."
3,benecol smart Chews,I can't tell you much about it because I have not had a cholesterol test yet. Ask me again in 5 months
3,"benecol chew work, they really do","I should give this a five star rating because I know the product works. Ive been cheating for 3 months, and not doing so well. Im back on track watching my fat intake, and using the benecol chews, Ive gotten my numbers down to 212, but its back up to 245, so Im REALLY GOING TO STICK TO MY BENECOL. TRY THEM THEY WORK."
1,waxy yellow build up,"I purchased these chews at the request of my mom, who had read about them.We were both sorely disappointed, in that they start out OK, but as you near the end of eating one, you are left with a waxy film on your mouth, tongue and lips, which needs to be scrubbed off with a toothbrush! It is disgusting! And I wrote repeatedly to the company, asking for a refund, and telling them of the problem, and have never heard back.A terrible way to do business, but a good idea. The other company's calcium chews do NOT have this problem!"
3,did not order,I didnot ordered this item. It was even hard for me to effort the benecol smart chews. This was really very good for me to lower my cholestrol. I really liked it.
5,lower cholesterol,These are an easy way to get the plant stanol esters they were recommended by my nutritionist to reduce cholesterol. It has been working
3,Does Benecol actually help???,"After using this product for many months, I finally had my blood work done. Unfortunately, there was no lowering of my cholesterol, actually, it went up by one. Mind you, I am a healthy eater and exercise regularly. I was a bit disappointed. So whether or not it really helps, I am not too sure. I was just trying to prevent having to take medications. After I am done with my supply of benecol, I am going to see what happens without taking it too."
5,Benecol chews,this really works' it reduced my cholesterol so much my doctor decided i didn't need medication after taking this for a couple of months
4,Benecol Smart Chews,"This is my second box of Benecol.I ordered this product which was recommended to aid in lowering Cholesterol. So far, My cholesterol has remained at an acceptable level.The chews have a nice carmel flavor."
3,okay,i havent used it much dont like the taste and its kinda expensive I dont want to come up with that much money every month
2,ok,this book was alright. Not great but it was an alright read. never going to be on my top ten must read
4,eye opener,As I read though this book I had a light blub moment and for that one large moment I gave this book a 4 star because that changed the way I look at why I eat. I hope you have your light blub moment.
1,Great TV when it works,Great TV. Picture is awesome. Enjoyed it when it was working. Needed repairs at 15 months (not under warranty) Cost $700. Needed repairs again for same issue at 18 months (three months later). Another $700 projected. Decided to replace TV
4,Ajax in Action,"It does more than introduce ajax to the reader. It also covers a little bit of programming methodology and some things to keep in mind when writing even a simple application. Overall it is a good book, but not if you are new to programming and especially if you are new to JavaScript."
2,"I agree, incorrectly named","I've bought the portuguese version of this book (AJAX em Ao), and I agree that it was incorrectly named.I have a good experience with AJAX, and I was looking for an ""AJAX bible"", with hacks and something like this... but, like other people here, I am disappointed.The book is excellent as a guide for project patterns that can be applied not just to AJAX, but to any web project. But the title, ""AJAX in Action"", suggest another type of content."
2,Verbose and directionless,"At 650 pages one would expect this book to be an AJAX Bible. Instead it meanders and wanders from topic to topic without getting into meaningful code examples or applications. The author could probably have written this book in under 300 pages and created a much better product.On the other hand, the book isn't boring and, if you like rhetoric, find a comfortable chair and set in for a week of easy reading."
2,"Well written, but unfortunately way out of date","It's amazing how much the JavaScript world has changed.This book has a relaxing style, and it was enjoyable to read. However, it no longer represents what I think of as ""modern"" JavaScript. For instance, it doesn't cover closures until appendix B, and even then it tells the reader to avoid them. These days, having studied Dojo, jQuery, and Douglas Crockford's videos, it's clear that closures are at the heart of how modern JavaScript is written.The copyright for this book is 2006, yet the index doesn't even mention Firebug, YUI, dojo, or jQuery which are now staples of the JavaScript community. Although, dojo is at least mentioned in the list of Ajax frameworks and libraries.This book is an interesting piece of the history of JavaScript, but for those wanting to learn modern JavaScript, I recommend watching Douglas Crockford's videos instead."
4,"Clear Concise, with Practical Examples","This book is a little outdated at this point, but provides clear and practical examples of using AJAX. It was very easy to understand, and most of the content still remains up to date."
4,It's About Web Architecture... Buy it for that reason,"I also will agree with the comment: ""Principles of Web architecture and design... and a few words about Ajax"". However, I find it to be an incredible book. It goes in depth about the Model View Controller, Design Patterns, and Refactoring. All terms that I did not know in depth. I actually skipped over a lot of the how-to AJAX stuff and read about the design theories. I can't wait to read it again.The Appendix on how JavaScript works is worth the price of the book alone. NOW I understand how that crazy prototype works."
3,"Informative, but full of tiresome political commentary","This book is highly informative. I learned a lot about geography, other cultures, history, and especially current world events. As a result, I'm more interested in the world headlines that I see in the newspaper every day.That said, I did not enjoy the way the author relentlessly pounds her political views into the reader's head. As another reviewer remarked, she does seem to hate her country, and indeed, does not live here. Her constant United States-bashing detracts from the book."
2,not bad but def. left of center,"I actually own this book and for some reason never thought about it being biased until I delved into topics I know more about than she does apparently. I could go into detail about it but won't bother.She tends state her opinions as fact and it is obvious that she takes a ""blame America first"" attitude; almost as if she is taking the standpoint of somebody who lives in Europe who wants to placate her European friends by showing she is subtly embarrassed to be American.The world is much more complex than she would have you believe, and she is by no means a well read diplomat. I mean c'mon she encourages people to read the BBC. I will credit her with her endorsement of the Economist though, I believe that is a very fair and balanced magazine."
4,"Lots of good information, but","I found the book provides a great overview for understanding various armies of the past. However, I have issues when it comes to believing a lot of it when the author doesn't know which century a particular year is actually in. I'm sure so much of the information is accurate, but this simple and consistent issue throughout the book tends to make a reader lose faith in the remaining content."
4,Dissapointing,"I thought that this game was going to be awesome. I was very dissapointed. The controls get very annoying and the gameplay is very redundant. There is no real strategy, you basically run around and shoot. The game is way too easy. I beat it in 4 days only playing about an hour or so a night. They could have made this game a lot better."
2,Not what i expected,"Graphics: the environments are done well,However the animation and character models could have been alot better.Audio: the only thing in the game that is remotely competetive. AI: very rough , with far too many characters running into walls, it does make them easier to kill. Story:The script is hillarious, but the acting almost made me wet myself.I really wanted to like this game as i was a big fan of ""outlaw"".I have heard a western RPG is coming out based on ""the good the bad and the ugly"" I hope it's better than this."
5,Great for Biblr Study,"Awesome primer for basic knowledge, I utilize this for teaching bible study and Sunday school. I find the book to be one of my most valuable resources"
3,"Good product, needs better instructions","This was a replacement product for one that did not work. This one worked, but the instructions were vague as to how to have more than one receiver. It said you can have more than one, but didn't tell you the specific sequence to add the second sensor. We received it in a very short time and now that we have it all set up, we are happy with its performance."
1,Hasn't worked yet,Works great in the house. Mounted 200ft out in my yard it has yet to work despite my efforts to reposition it for better reception.
1,Not what I expected.. it's just a whiteboard session,"This DVD is not what I thought it would be.. this is just a coach standing in front of a whiteboard for an hour explaining the design of the DW blocking schemes.. While I think he has good ideas and concepts, I was hoping for some live examples of the blocking, showing a walk through with proper techniques and such.. Don't get me wrong, this DVD can prove valuable if you haven't run the DW before and want to understand the idea behind power and counters, but don't expect to see the DW in action except for a short 5 minute clip of some plays shot from a sideline handheld camera where you can't really see the blocks being executed anyway."
3,Climbing Higher - not worth the climb?,"At first reading I liked the smooth easy way of Montels wording. Making you feel as if you are a personal friend. Then in a few chapters it seems as if he gets rambling about bits & pieces, losing track of where he was going making reading/understanding a bit difficult. He settles back down for a chapter or two. When it hits again he must still be miffed about the subject b/c he goes on and on and on and on and on. He gets smooth and personal again only to get on his soapbox about the medical use of marijana - which I MUST ADMIT he did give me a different outlook about the subject than I had before reading this chapter, but he just didn't want to let it go. Again going on and on and on and on and on some more - enough already. The book is a small peek into some of the hardships he has endured. It is a book you can read in a evening and come away with maybe a different outlook - then again maybe not!"
5,It takes great power to admit that you have something wrong,"Although some people may think that his book is not good i give Mr. Williams my entire support. It takes great power and determination to actually come out and admit tht one has a proble. He makes us come in touch with his ture feelings. It also makes us the people aware of the problems that people with MS feel. If he contimplated the thought of suicide was only becasue he could not bare the pain any more, but through his determination he is able to get up every day and go to work instead of feeding off us the tax payers."
3,The..,"I am not a fan of Montell at all, and I don't watch his show. I don't know what made me pick this book, but I'm glad I read it. The book was not what I expected at all. I had never heard of MS prior to reading this book. It was short and to the point. He makes some compelling arguments for the legalization of marijuana and the benefits and disadvantages of some other drugs. I felt his pain as I read the book. I felt every spasm, frustration, and fatigue episode. This will be a helpful read for MS sufferers. I hope a cure is found soon. I also hope that those who do not have MS will pick up the book and understand not just the nature of the ailment, but also those who live with it daily."
1,Disappointment,"As a collector of cookbooks,and a fanatic when it comes to cooking I was very disappointed in the layout of the book. Compared to other Greek cookbooks that I own this one in particular doesn't meet my needs as an American who wants plain Greek recipes. I believe for this money you could get two if not three cookbooks about Greek cuisine that's tasty."
5,A Child Of Jarrow,"A Child Of Jarrow is the sequel to The Jarrow Lass,....once again a powerful book with an insight into the time and conditions of a bygone age. This book kept me wanting to read on as did the first book. A super writer, in the same vein as the lady the book is written about. An excellent read."
2,A Child of Jarrow,"I chose this rating because I didnt like the book it was boring same thing all theough the book not a patch on Nora Roberts ,Cathrin Cookson ectI am still reading the othe two in this sequal"
1,Tai Chai for seniors,"I am not happy with this DVD. I wanted the one done by Mark Johnson, I believe was his name. We left MN the day after the DVD came and are volunteering doing diaster relief work. I hope to send it back to you and get the right one, but I'll do that next week. Thank you. Norma Baas"
2,Beware-final price is higher,"Beware. The price listed does not include the cost of the AC power adapter. Furthermore, you must take care to make sure you get the correct power adapter, something I am not finding easy at this point. Unless you want to replace the batteries every six hours while you practice, the AC power adapter is essential - as Casio knew when they put this device on the market.Had it not been for that one issue, I would have been absolutely elated with this product."
5,"Smiles, Smiles and More Smiles",My 11 week old just loves Zed. The colors and shapes in this pop-up simply captivate her over and over again. The whole series is great!
5,very heavy duty,"This is a very sturdy, heavy duty item which seems to last a lifetime. I promise and update should I experience anything to the contrary."
5,Maybe my instructions were not clear to you?.....Whack!,"You have to love a DVD from the history channel that begins with the decapitation of two geisha girls. The Art of War focuses on the military applications of this 400 BC warrior, and it would also be nice to see a DVD from the history channel on the Sports, Politics, and Business applications for these principles as well. For now, this is a DVD that requires repeated viewings and contemplation that you will learn somthing new from with each viewing. Whatever issues you may be facing in your own life, there is an applicable principle from Sun Tzuthat will guide you to better decision making. The true value of this product is that Sun Tzu's principles can be reviewed in a convenient, entertaining, visual format."
5,view from the trenches,"as an old marine AND army officer & gentlebean, i found this documentary both intriguing and informative. i would make it mandatory watching for any cadet and all recruits into any branch of the military."
5,Excellence,This book is complete copy of the television program which allows me to watch it over and over. I love the speedy delivery.
1,Pretty Darn Bad,"Did anybody pay attention while producing this book? Why wasn't it fact-checked? In the tables comparing WebTV Classic and WebTV Plus, the information is completely reversed! Not just in one table, but in all the comparison tables showing price and features. Newcomers especially should stay away from this book. Try the WebTV for Dummies book."
3,This Game is awsome!!,I got hooked to this game imediately when i started. the feature of multiplayer co-op game is great. This game is so awsome! Lots of Bosses and cool monsters. Each character at lvl 15 gets a helper dragon or animal.THIS GAME IS AWSOME!!
5,Ignore the reviewer behind the green curtain,"Regardless of the Amazon.com's review, this game is a heck of a lot of fun, and I have gotten more than my $50 out of it in the past few weeks. I have always been a fan of Gauntlet, and have played it on the Nintendo (Gauntlet and Gauntlet II) as well an N64. This is by far the best version I have played - and a better game, overall, than the arcade version. The only downside is the 3D view, on some levels, can spin and diorient the player - not often, but enough to notice. My only other complaint is it only has 30 or so levels - I want more! :) If you want flashy graphics to OOH and AAH over for a few hours, then throw away for the next new game, this isn't it. But if you want a good GAME, this is for you."
3,"THis game is pretty good, but a little repetative",I thought the game was really fun to play but it does get a little repetative. The music and sound are pretty good but they could be a bit better. This game is for four players but waht is not told to you is that you need an Expansion Pack to play with four. Only three without
4,"Great gameplay. Very, very good game. Bad graphics.",I say ages 8 and up for slight violence. Great game and I suggest you buy it. The way players can grow levels is nice. If you get it I suggest being a Wizard or Archer.
2,Not good,This is an over all bad game.I feel the real bad thing about this game is that I hate the way you build up your characters.If your like me and have played FFVII you know when you build up your characters you hit stronger and kill enemies quiker.In this game all it does you change your suit and you look cooler.I don't recommened this game to many people but it is something if you like the arcade game then you will probally like this one if not don't buy it.
4,Bettie Page,"I once had the VHS, and there was an ""Apache Dance"" number in that tape--however--that dance number has been removed from this DVD, through no fault of Bettie Page. It is, though, an excellent representation of the nostalgic 50s-60s burlesque scene, and still has some funny joke skits that are very enjoyable."
1,Gorgeous Sink BUT This is not the right description!!!!,"Buyer be warned that this is not the 9"" deep model. I purchased this item thinking I was getting a 9"" deep Franke sink. Amazon screwed up the description on this Franke SKU. This is the 7"" version. On a side note it is a gorgeous sink if you like a shallow sink."
5,I Love My Bent,"I ride a bent, mostly because I'm too fat for a regular bike. I was hit by a car once and now I have a lumpy leg.Did you know on a bent, you can ride and eat a donut?Yum!I loved the book, I hope they make a movie!"
5,Solid alarm for the $$,"Have had this alarm for about 4 months and have found it to be a reliable product at a reasonable price. The sensor does seem to attract cobwebs which has resulted in a few false alarms (I think?), but I've been very pleased with this alarm system (especially considering the price)."
2,Chamberlain Wireless Alert System,"We are having some troubles with the consistancy of this item. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. There is no rhyme or reason to this. The only thing we can think of is if the antenna are not exactly facing each other the alarm will not sound. That can be a tricky thing since one of the pieces is OUTSIDE and there are the elements to contend with and animals running up and down the trees. So it seems like we are outside trying to adjust it every day. I won't recommend this item or purchase one like this again, that's for sure."
3,Works well with limitations,"Product is nicely designed, especially for outdoor use. What I don't like is that you cannot add indoor receivers to the same outdoor sensor. The alarm buzzer is not loud enough so if you are watching television it must be in the same room or you don't hear it. Also the alarm lamp lights only briefly, which is virtually useless."
3,"Range limited, signals missed","This is a good product - not great. Advertised 55 db signal is plenty loud unless you've got the stereo cranked up. I can hear it anywhere in the house. I purchased a second sensor, so I hear one beep for the first, two for the second. Attention must be made to placement. 500' through a window and a few tree branches is almost too far; some signals are missed. Also, unit only ""looks"" for motion once per second, so a faster-moving vehicle can be missed. Place unit lower to catch more of the vehicle - as well as the occasional deer."
3,Mine was not as sensitive as others say,"I was trying to protect a townhouse parking space against vandals and thieves. After testing at a variety of heights and angles, it seemed that people on foot would be detected reliably only to about 10' away. Occasionally it would hit at 20', but I need close to 100% reliability, not ""occasional"" hits! Build quality seems OK and radio range seems OK, but the detection range was too short for me. I'm sending it back."
1,Wouldn't recommend it,The only place I could get this to work was if I had the transmitter and receiver in the same room. I placed them about 300 feet apart and never could get it to work. I have already sent it back. Had to spend a little more but got one that really works good at a lot farther distance. I was a little skeptical when I opened the box when I received the Chamberlain and seen how cheap it looked. Definitely a bad choice.
2,Not as good as the older versions,We have purchased these in the past and they have worked very well. The new ones do not have the range of the old model. They used to be one of the best and now I will not purchase this item again. Return to Amazon. Made in China now????
1,chamberlain driveway monitor,this system would not reach 50 feet. i guess you get what you pay for. Bought a $150.00 unit (actually 2 units ) and they work great. Buy a unit called driveway informer. WORKS GREAT
5,"""The Reporter"" Wireless Alert System","This is the second Reporter I have purchased. The first has operated perfectly and alerts us when vehicles are on our rural driveway. My wife particularly depends on it when she is home alone. My daughter liked it so much, that I purchased the second Reporter for her home."
1,Don't Buy It,"Gave it to my parents. It doesn't work, they have tried everything. Support people say lithum(sp?) batteries but that didn't work either. Goes off randomly but when people pull up it doesn't go off. Don't waste your time or money."
1,Transmitter is crap,"Setting off this unit is hit or miss beyond about 10ft from the sensor. Additionally, the transmitter in it has about a 30ft range on a line of sight as is. I did manage to get about 100ft by adding about 2ft of wire onto the antenna for the base unit, but I shouldn't have to do this... If I didn't have a line of sight, I got half those ranges at best. The packaging is misleading and you can get nowhere near 900 feet from this thing. The only place I can realistically use this unit is right by my kitchen window. I will not be buying another unit for the end of my 400ft drive."
2,"Range is not great, inconsistent behavior",I have it about 400 ft away and it misses half the cars that come through. Tried moving around and repositioning but it doesn't seem to make any difference.My advice would be to find another option...
1,Low Sound,This alarm is great but you can't hear it. The buzzer is so low that you have to be right next to it to hear and there is no volume control or accessory that would allow you to add a loud buzzer. If you can't hear it what good is it.
2,Lowered Quality - Beware Compatibility,"First ordered the Reporter Wireless Alert with 2-Way Voice and 2 PIR non-voice sensors which turned out to be incompatible. Then ordered this non-voice unit to work with the PIR sensors. This product was made by a different company (Chamberlain) which had apparently bought our the previous Reporter company, and the quality was definitely reduced. It had fewer features and no option to change the horrible buzz alert. The original 2-way Voice model works great, but would not recommend the newer products made by Chamberlain."
2,Reporter wireless alert system,"I purchased this device to alert me of vehicles coming down our driveway. The unit strangely is more accurate at identifying birds, deer and people than vehicles, which it only picks up about 50% of the time and most often when they depart.Instructions tell you not to place it in the sun ! Hardly possible when locating it outdoors. Its' mounted location is very critical to its' performance and so far I have not found the sweet spot.I am determined to get it to work properly, but you may determine that it is not worth the effort."
1,wireless alert system,"the alarm is very weak and can't be heard unless your standing next to it.In my opion the product is needs to have a louder alarm,as it is it's not worth the money.I put it back in the box since I can't use it."
1,Very Disappointed,"Should be a simple concept...when a car drives by, the buzzer sounds. Not the case here! After meticulously following the directions, calling customer support and waiting 18 minutes (I was determined) to speak to the tech for advice, I'm boxing it up and sending it back. I have a driveway in a wide open field, less than 500' from the base. Never could get it to work. It would buzz at nothing, and NEVER buzz when a vehicle passed. Don't buy it!!!"
2,Driveway Alarm,"This alarm would not work at our house. After talking to technical support at Chamberlain they said it was because we have casement windows that have metal around them and a ""prairie style"" metal insert inside of the glass of the window. Very disappointing."
5,"Long Range, Good Battery life.","I have used this item for two years to alert me to possible intruders at the corners of my property. The range between the sensor and the base station is greater than other remote systems I have tried and the batteries last much longer than the others. Also, the dark green color makes it unnoticeable.Two words of caution - 1. If you add additional sensors, be sure to get the correct model. For this base you need the PIR2-300 add on sensor. (There is also available a CWPIR add on sensor, and it will NOT work with this system. I made that mistake.)2. To add an additional sensor to the base station, follow the (brief) instructions carefully."
1,not as described,"I bought this driveway monitor about 3 weeks ago based on the good reviews. but after hooking it up, i could only get about 100 feet and no farther. I called up chamberlain and they said I had a bad unit. They sent me another unit but I could only get 100 feet out of this one to. Would not buy another one again."
3,Where to find an add-on sound device,"The Chamberlain Wireless Alert System #RWA-300R device works fine, except that the sound from the receiver is not loud enough. The instructions state that the base station has a relay which can activate other devices such as a doorbell, buzzer, etc...and that the relay switch can handle up to 120 AC volts at 10 amps. It also states that the accessory device will need a separate power supply....and that such accessories can be purchased at any electronics store.I went to a Radio Shack store with the instructions, and they had no suggestions for such an accessory. I then called Chamberlan's technical service...and they had nothing to recommend.I would appreciate help on what to buy, and where to buy it."
2,Poor Quality,For $[...] I expected much better quality. The thing fell apart after just over a year.
4,Better than Halo 2,"I just recieved Red Dead Revolver in the mail today. Yesterday I purchased Halo 2 because I wanted to see if it could possibly live even up to a fraction of the hype. No it didn't, in fact it sucks. Multiplayer will get old and eventually Xbox live will die after years, then you will have an unplayable mess. I still have Nintendo games I have fun with that aren't online enable. Now, Red Dead Revolver reminds me of those old school games. I must admit, with its lukewarm reviews I didn't expect to be impressed with it. I am. The best western game I've ever played, finally someone got it right. It's story and gameplay are what I expected for this kind of game. Definately worth the $30 bucks. Forget Halo 2 and purchase this true gem for your Xbox or Playstation 2. Also try Otogi which I love and is another underrated game."
3,"The late, despairing Illich","This book is an edited transcript of interviews with Illich conducted by Canadian Broadcasting Company's David Cayley in the late 80s. It is a wide-ranging portrait of the great thinker, but while it looks back on the hugely important ideas about industrialization, development, scale, and humanity which Illich spread in the 60s and 70s, it does so through the gloomy fog of despair and resignation that overtook him in later life-- ""we have no future about which we can say anything, or about which we have any power,"" he muses towards the end of the book.This book is thus not the ideal entry point for those interested in understanding and building on Illich's contributions towards a decentralized, democratic, ecologically sound and humane society. For such readers I cannot recommend his early books highly enough, particularly ""Deschooling Society"", ""Tools for Conviviality"", and ""Celebration of Awareness""."
1,Makes a good Coaster,"This is the biggest dissapointment I've ever had. The game has fouls. Fouls are stupid. Why would you put fouls in a game where mascots and horses are playing? Make the game fun, don't make it stupid. If I wanted to play ""real"" basketball with ""called fouls"" then I'd go outside, but I don't want to go outside. That's why I got this game. But it is terrible..."
1,N64 needs good B-ball games,"This game has no big-time dunks. No action, I turned it off as soon as I started playing it. They also need Kevin Garnett on the cover, like NBA live 2001 for pc!"
3,Not the typical NBA Jam game,"I've been collecting NBA Jam games since the original came out for the Super NES and I'm still a major NBA Jam fan, but NBA Showtime is a MAJOR disappointment! After playing the first game of it, I realized that it's far from being the normal NBA Jam calibur game that all the others including NBA Hangtime were. What ever happened to the no fouls? You can't even push down anybody more than 5 times anymore. And this is NBA Jam we're talking about? The only improvement in this one over NBA Hangtime is the graphics. The graphics are pretty good, the crowd and the reflections on the floor were cool. But everything else about it seemed dead.It just seems like they rushed through making NBA Showtime because it is far from being as good as all the other NBA Jam games were. If you want an NBA Jam game on the N64, get NBA Hangtime."
5,BUY IT!,"This game is amazing and highly enjoyable ecpessially with multable players this over the top action packed games is a must have, even though its dated its still great!"
3,Longing for slower? You are not alone,"In this millennium, our interests, our relationships, our existences have become abbreviated as we try to fit more and more in to the same 24 hours our parents and grandparents had in their days. The book reflects on what has happened and why. It presents examples of people and organizations that are attempting to turn back the clock to achieve more satisfying and full-flavored lives. It was well-written but at times felt a little redundant."
3,Just OK as an introduction the subject,"This is an entertaining book on the slow movement. The book touches many subjects like food, sex, children, medical care and city life. However, in my opinion, it falls short of conveying the philosophical message. Incidentally, the book is not written slowly, but you can feel the rush of the author in writing it! I think it is fairly OK for those who know nothing about what the slow movement is or are just starting to consider reducing the pace of their lives. In my opinion, Lin Yutang's ""The importance of living"", written in the late 30's, is incomparably better and deeper, with the author slowly (!) delving into the philosophical core of the art of enjoying what is good in life."
2,Could be better...,"I was considering purchasing this game as I have played it in the arcade. Good thing I rented it first. The AI is set for 'impossible to beat' even on the easiest level. I found myself down 35-7 after the 1st quarter (2 minutes!) using the best team they have! The taunts and the linebackers bodyslamming the ball carrier are funny, but the lack of playability isn't woth the cost."
2,"Fun for a few goes, but then it loses it's flavor","Minus the addition of the ability to play with 4 players, this is pretty much the same game as the first. I recommend you rent this only if you're having a get-together with some friends, but it get's really repetitive after a while, and it will lose your interest."
4,Informative,"This book is very informative. Whether you are a beginner or advanced musician, or simply someone interested in music holistically, this is an excellent book."
1,"Not even sad, just pathetic","In an interview published in an issue of The Review of Contemporary Fiction half-devoted to his work, David Markson explained the decade-long gaps in his oeuvre as ""sheer barnyard laziness"". That phrase came to haunt me as I whizzed through this shallow montage of high-culture trivia. (Typical paragraph, quoted in its entirety: ""Richard Wagner was an anti-Semite."" Got that?) I can't conceive of a lazier way to manufacture a book than Markson has come up with here. The impression is of a tired old scribbler (the author has been collecting Social Security for a while now) who still needs to think of himself as an artist, even though what little of the Divine Flame he once tended (his major effort was a pretentious melange of recycled Malcolm Lowry called ""Going Down"") sputtered out decades ago."
1,Buggy even today,"I'm a long time DLink fan (Love their Routers), but I'm really disappointed in this product. This product still suffers from bugs even after firmware 1.07 (7 revisions later). The device still hangs at 94% when formatting new drives and after trying all the work arounds it still fails to properly format a drive for me.Either way this product is slow and out of date today. You should only expect about 12MB/s with this product despite Gigabit Ethernet because it only has 32MB of ram. You're better off buying the Intel SS4200-E NAS which has much faster transfer rates and can hold 4 drives for about the same price."
1,TOTALMENTE decepcionado,"TOTALMENTE decepcionadoBuenas nochesCompre este producto, llegue a mi casa le instale tan recomendado FIRMWARE 1.08 le instale el cliente BITORRENT funciono correctamente, en la mañana no te deficiencia en su funcionamiento a pesar de esta a 1gb decidí hacer un reset manual por el botón de atrás y el equipo MURIO, llame a Garantía y me dijeron que lo tenía que enviar nuevamente a DLINK. Para mi mejor lean en el FORO de Dlink los problemas del equipo.Saludos"
4,"Used, Sold as New","I like the product. But beware, Amazon sells used items as new. Proof: on the CD there was a stick-it note that said CD is warped. Sure enough, the CD is warped. Someone obviously returned this item because of the warped CD and Amazon resold it to me, with the warped CD and the sticky note, as new. Further proof: the taped seal on the box was opened. Buyer beware."
4,Easy to set up,"I am moderately network savvy and needed a NAS storage device with RAID for my small business environment. The D-Link NAS is a nicely made enclosure and setup really was painless. I added two drives from the local computer store, plugged it in and set up the basic parameters according to the instructions. No real problems. I still haven't delved into all of the more sophisticated features. In general, I would say that the manual could have been a little more verbose. The scheduled backup feature (which I use for nightly backups) works, but is very unsophisticated. That said, this drive could easily be combined with more sophisticated backup software. In short, seems a good reasonably priced solution for fail-safe storage for my small business."
5,Greate DNS so far,"I likes this DNS so far, no problem are all with latest firmware update. Here are my pros/cons:Pros:+ Bit torrent included+ Expandable (you can customize the unit with third party apps)+Updates really fix issues and they are often+ The hard drives are shut down when not in use. Great functionality (need to update to latest firmware version)+ Works great with 2x1Gb drives+ Price. You won't find anything so robust for the price.Cons:+ A little slow with 1000 mb connection+ Naming the drives. The drive names are hardcoded and cannot be renamed.+iTunes app shows weird characters on mp3s. Don't know why, but in windows they look fine+ Not a con, but a limitation of using linux: An exact copy of files is not possible, because of the difference handling of files by the OS."
4,"Cheap NAS, works well","Physically, the box is nice and small and is a perfect stand for my cable modem.Installation was painlessly easy. Just inserted a 750gb drive and off it went.You definitely want to upload the latest firmware from DLink to get the most functionality.The only other thing I'd recommend would be to get a gigabit router. Copying big files over 100baseT is awfully slow, compared to what the box can do at 1kBaseT. If you think the transfer is slow compared to your other external harddrives, upgrade to gigabit.As for functionality, it's awesome. We now keep our digital pictures there, so that anyone can upload new digital photos from their cameras from their own computer. I no longer need to keep my main PC on to serve that purpose."
2,Power button does not work and Fan does not stop.,"This device is OK so far but not great. It is noisy and i find on the forums that people have had problems with it wiping drives. The problem i have is that the power button does not power off the unit and the Fan keeps running even when it sleeps. ( I set it to automatic power off mode ) It ran all night, so its not that it had to cool off the drive.How do you NOT get this right?You push the power button when the drive is asleep and it spins up the drives before turning the whole thing off.You have to keep pressing the button several times to get it to turn off. holding the button down does not help either.When I shut it down via the web interface it turns off without issue, but that is a hassle. The only reason I want to shut it off is because the fan does n't stop, contrary to the advertising!!!!BTW, i upgraded the Firmware to latest 1.09 Version. It did n't help."
5,d-Link DNS-323,"This product works!! It is everything I expected, and worked right out of the box. Instructions were simple and accurate. I have used it for months, without any issues either major or minor. I recommend this product without reservation."
3,cheap price = cheap item,"First time we ever ordered something like this, so didn't know what to expect. It's very cheap material overall, the dragon looks like it's made out of gold aluminum foil. We didn't even bother with the stickers. The slats are about the same caliber as a paint can stirrer stick from Lowe's and the little hooks between them are so soft and bend and break so easily you don't even realize they are actual metal. The belts we placed on it do not look anything like the ones in the picture. The belts are bulky and weigh down the slats overall. It causes everything to want to droop forward and down. I would hope that we shouldn't cut his belts to eliminate the bulkiness. For now, it's working but we would not recommend this item."
1,HATE IT,"Awful. I bought this to go in my son's room as it is seperated from the main house. I plugged it in, and when I went back to make sure it was working properly it burnt my hand. I later went back to check on it, and burnt my hand again. Needless to say, this was a waste of my time and money, and will NOT be in my son's room. About a half hour out of the box, and it found it's way to the trash barrell. Very disappointing and would never recommend to anyone."
3,"""The Death Of A Legend"" Disappointing","instead of a continuation of the early history of the Horseclans this books finds Bili the Axe, famous war chief, dying as his mind returns to some of the more famous incidents of his life including further details of how the Moon Maidens, a warlike all female tribe came into the Confederation and how the original kings of Kuhmbuhluhner (Cumberland) lost their heritage and using a form of ""mindspeak"" caused Bili's command to join them in a war against their enemies; but basically it's a rehash of information from the first seven books regarding Bili's life which was of interest the first time around but not a second time; it appears to be an attempt to bring new readers up to speed on the history of the Confederation but is too limited to do this well; I was very disappointed in the book as a continuation of the series, as a ""stand alone"" it's adequate"
1,Nothing more than a dressed up manual,"The book is only for those of you who have picked up Truespace3 as a toy, it's merely a manual that is lacking much of any useful content. For those who pirated the program, it's a manual, for anyone else, it's a paperweight. Our only hope is that Peter Plantec, Frank Rivera, or someone with a great skill of writing AND Truespace3 will write a Truespace3 Bible, so that this book will be forgotten. Note: I have nothing against E. Swan, it's just that a poorly written book deserves a realistic response."
5,"A great, fun source of information for 3D Graphics!","This book is a must-have for both those interested in getting started in 3D graphics modeling/animation, or those trueSpace addicts who want to sharpen their skills!E.W.'s great personality and techniques really shine through.. It honestly helps make it quite easy to learn. A great accomplishment for a subject that many people may initially think is beyond their abilities. I believe this is why many schools getting started in 3D modeling & animation classes are grabbing this book as ""standard issue""..If 3D is not new to you, you'll appreciate the in-depth descriptions of the tools and great real-world examples. The examples, the color section, and the additional ""goodies"" on the CD are very motivational and productive!Using this book and trueSpace3 will let you get started in 3D today"
1,Boring - no challenge for average stepper,"Poor cueing by the instructor which is frustrating to follow. Constant talking with irrating voice pitch. If I hear ""thats beautiful"" one more time....."
2,Ordinary Magic--total bore or book written for adults?,"In this book, Ganesh is the main character, and he goes through a lot in India and America alike. I think that the author wrote this book to be for adults, but when it wasn't long enough, he simplified it and made it a child's book. If this book had been originally written for a child, then it would have had a more ""believable ending"", and not have this short process. The author took you by the hand, and told everything that was going to happen fifteen pages before it happened. Sorry Malcom Bosse, but you really failed this time."
5,History repeats,"Our son who is 31 years old had Marvel the Mustang when he was young. He enjoyed it so much. It was great for a young active boy. He felt just like he was riding a horse. Marvel never broke. Wish we had kept the original one. Now I look forward to our grandson having the same toy. Thank you ""Back to Basics!"
2,THANKS FOR THE WARNING,"THEY ARE AMONG US is a somewhat flaccid rehashing of INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS, with an obvious made for television veneer. A small town is plagued by what appears to be aliens inhabiting human bodies, but the script is plagued with an unfocused narrative and confusing red herrings. Alison Eastwood gamely plays an alien hunter, but we're never really sure where she's coming from or how she came to know about the aliens. A seemingly perfect family of father, mother and son are at the heart of the upcoming ""event"" which seems to be taking place on the son's 18th birthday. Good luck in guessing what this ""event"" is. Although the movie has decent effects, it is far from reaching the status of BODY SNATCHERS and ultimately ends up looking like a failed tv pilot."
4,good neo-psychedelia,"Ok, I am biased. I saw these guys lots of times and have all the albums and love them.I'm not sure who to to compare them to, but on this album we have Heazlewood's trademark sinister 'surf' guitar, a bit of (Hawkwind-like) audio-generatorish whooshing/noise rock, and Celia's sultry organ and vocals.At times it's 60's pastiche meets dark acid trip at other times it's catchy noise-rock.It's mostly good stuff; especially if you would like to know what the Beach Boys would sound like if they took 'good vibrations' and strangled it until they let it up for breaths ...occasionally."
1,Crap,Don't waste your money...basically a homemade video/DVD of old 70s news clips and one from Fox TV from the Farewell Tour. Disc has no menu and start up screen title says Kiss Forever instead of Shout Ot Out Loud. Total playtime only 40 minutes.
4,A Boon of a Book,"Travelers, whether just starting out or seasoned, who are planning a visit to France will recognize Joseph Harriss' ABOUT FRANCE to be a boon of a book. Always informative and entertaining, the author's observations approach and explain the attitudes and politics of the French. Any book containing complete chapters committed to champagne, oysters, mustard and vacations make it ""my kind of read"". In light of recently reported labor law demonstrations by the French youth, the 1968 student demonstrations chronicled in his book are insightful, and uncannily comparable . Traveling to France? ABOUT FRANCE by Joseph Harriss should enhance your journey. Bon Voyage!!!"
2,"France Past., Not France Present","The book is comprised of a series of articles written by the author as correspondent from France for TIME and various other journals. The most recent was published in 2000, and the others go back to 1968 of thereaboutrs. It depicts France and the French autrefois, not France or the French of today."
3,Jeeze - I really don't know!,"After reading all of the reviews from different site, I decided to go ahead and buy RE2...I waited for over two weeks for the cartridge to arrive and finally after all the anticipations, i have to say i'm a lot disappointed! Maybe its great for all the other players but I'm so bad at the game...THE CONTROLLER IS A PAIN ...! How can you even move in the right direction exluding the excaping part when the zombies were heading toward you????????? GOSH that [disappoints]! I can't even pass the first scene of the game after three hundred million tries! (The controller - arghhhhhhhh!) Anyway, you should get it if you were born to conquer N64 controller - if not, practice makes perfect - BUT DO YOU HAVE THE PATIENCE??????????? ...- Well, the sounds and graphics and everything deserve a 3 stars. HBottom Line: Get it if you played all of the N64 games - or just stick with Perfect Dark or Zelda or EVEN the italian guy would be soo much better. c+ (at least RE2 don't get grounded!)"
2,ABOUT TURN,Change of heart for n64? Nope the machine start with no gore games. And then N64 users get Quake & and Quake 2 and now this. Weird and overall and a fairly workman like conversion of resident evil 2. Oh dear.
2,A shortcut in plot?,"The author definitely had some fun with the concept of time travel and created a fast-paced and entertaining story, which didn't get bogged down in concerns over the intracacies of time travel and its paradoxes or explanations as to how the the characters were able to skip so freely through time. However, I agree with many of the other reviewers that the ending was absolutely inexcusable. I've never encountered such a sudden and abrupt ending. I had to track down another copy of the book to ensure that I wasn't just missing pages. I can only assume that the author simply fell through a time hole himself and wasn't around the finish the book. The characters are left hanging without any resolution or explanation. While I appreciate that not every story has a happy ending, at a minimum, I expected an ending of some sort. Readers of this book will definitely feel cheated at the ""conclusion""."
4,Excellent read!,"I really enjoyed this book by Charles Dickinson. Time travel, being a well-explored topic of many writers over the years, gets a new wrinkle and then some. Less is more here. Dickinson's elegant style and structure moves the story along at a very satisfying pace. The tale comes to us in layers and waves - always moving forward and yet (time travel again here) multi-faceted and textured. Unlike many other tales of time-travel, most of the time we are in the present (wherever that happens to be at the moment) with the lead character and, as such, the narrative is easy to follow through the different twists and turns. Recommended!"
1,Just adding to the bad reviews!,"Ugh! At least I am not alone in staying up late at night and then being disappointed. I stayed up until 2:30 AM because the beginning of the book drew me in. I was willing to overlook the fact that the characters have no dimension because I LOVE time travel books and the premise of the book was very intriguing. But then, just when the book should be getting GREAT because the main character traveled to the 1800's...putt, putt, putter...putter.........done. Did the author not want to put the work into investigating what it would be like to live in the 1800's? Did his publisher call and say, ""That is enough! We need your book.""? Whatever the answer, what a poor excuse for an ending."
3,Telephony Systems with Asterisk,"I was hoping that this book would be more specific. I needed better real world examples of how to build a workable dial plan. While there were numerous examples, this book fell painfully short in teaching the theory of context location. An example is on page 77 where the author states""We simply place each handset into one of two contexts, based upon what number we want them to be able to dial."" Which configuration files contain the contexts that we need to place the extensions into? There are other similar examples. What this author should have done is detail every configuration file involved showing exactly what was happening and where. Now, I understand there are more that one flavor of dial plan. However, statements as shown above aren't even close to what is expected of a subject matter expert. I give it a 3 because it is of help to beginners but it won't get the job done standing alone.."
2,Decent,"Reading the first third of Don Tapscott's book ""The Digital Economy"" provides a good overview of the evolving computer revolution. However, the last two-thirds is basically a reiteration of the beginning of the book, with a never ending list of examples. Although through these example Tapscott illustrates his point that the economy will be forever changed by digital technology,he never goes below the surface to expand his argument. If you have no idea about the potential of computers, this book could be of some use. But, if you already have a fair understanding, you're best off reading a book that provides reasons and explanations instead of just examples."
4,A Good Read!,"Don Tapscott provides an overview of the way the digitalization of information is transforming the economy and projects the likely changes ahead from his perspective in 1996. The book suggests ways to exercise leadership effectively in this transformed, networked world. However, since this thoughtful, well-organized book was written several years ago, it is mainly of historical interest now, because of the rapid changes in the digital world. Still, it is useful to apply some of the themes Tapscott developed when you consider how the digital economy is continuing to evolve. ...recommend this well-written book for a general audience as well as executives and managers who are interested in the unfolding of the new economy."
3,Cheerleading the late 90's internet frenzy,"Read this book in '98 or '99 when the internet frenzy was at it's peak and I was just out of college. I was carried away by the author's romanticization of the emerging internet technologies; when he talked about the emerging new business models, the hubs, etc I listened as if the gospel was being revealed. The problem with this book was that the author was caught up in the frenzy like everyone else (so perhaps I can't blame him) and lacked a tempered view of the future. However, I have to admit, it did make me wise and the reason I take to heels when I see ""web 2.0"" literature."
5,Seiko men's watch,Came quickly and looked very nice. Good quality good price. Very pleased w item. I would use this sight again.
5,Seiko Men's Two Tone Watch #SGF204,"I am very pleased with this watch. It is elegant and keeps perfect time. Pricewise, it was a good deal. I have had good luck with Seiko watches."
1,This watch did not get the time and date right,"The watch I bought never got the date right. It changed the date every 12 hours instead of 24 hours as you know it. To get thing even worse, it couldn't even keep the time correct. One week after I received this watch, I returned it without any hesitation."
2,Trigger is the first thing to go,"I am a professional cabinet installer and I have owned this tool for a little over a year. The trigger has now gone bad on it for the second time. The first one lasted 9 months and the second one lasted six. Bosch will fix it again since it is still under waranty but I need one tomorrow so tonight I bought a Makita hoping it will last longer. The Bosch was my first impact driver and now I can't be without one for even a day. I have several cordless Bosch drills, saws, and planers that I have used them every day for several years and they all work perfectly so the trigger problem seems to be limited to just the impact driver."
1,Looks great but can't keep the date!,"I've had this watch for several years nows. It looks great and I was just what I was looking for. I paid $49.00 for and. There are two things that should be noted here.1) This watch has a curved face, this means it will more than likely have to be sent out to a have a battery replaced. The jewelry store I deal with along with every other one I could find in the mall could not change the battery. No one had the proper plate used to snap the watch backplate back on. So it had to be sent out.2) With mine, the watch never seemed to be able to keepo the date on track, it was always lacking behind and always needed reset."
4,Cheerful and uplifting pop music,"If you like fresh, interesting and original indie pop then you might enjoy this album. There are some truly effervescent moments where the songs can lift the listener up to a slightly higher plane; the mezzanine, where rabbits and honeyeaters nibble treats from your open hand and where the sun always shines but never burns your face. The quality of the songs is consistent, with a couple of standout tunes that lodge themselves in your memory -'Sailor Girl' and the aptly titled 'Spell Happiness' are the two that spring to mind. Dean Manning (remember Leonardo's Bride?) proves his worth as a singer on a few of these songs. He's got a nice voice that works in rather neatly with the band, who sound fresh and on their game. I found it & it brought me cheer. Thus I'm led to fully concur with Amazon's review on this one."
5,Perfect replacement,"After 20 years of use, my previous Seiko watch was no longer worth repair. I purchased this item and am completely satisfied with it as it is almost a copy of my old one. I can only hope that it will last as long as its' predecessor."
5,Best study Bible I've ever seen,"I've studied the King James Bible and the Living Bible, but my favorite is the Quest Study Bible (NIV Version). The comments in the side-bar areas give insight into the verses, the maps of Jesus ministry and Paul's journeys, and the dictionary and concordance make this a valuable study tool."
5,Stuck to the job,"I tried to fix a pair of 12 year old Soloman hiking shoes. The glue held, unfotunately the foam between the sole and the shoe did not. The glue joint did not fail, the foam did. That is the sign of a good glue joint. Worked as advertised, unfortunatley the shoe is beyond repair. Solomon did give me 50% off on a new pair."
1,Total different packaging. misleading the customer.,havent try it but it has different packaging from the picture.. hope its authentic ingredient and not fake product. It is misleading the customers based on the picture here.
4,Alot of bang for the buck,"I have mature skin that needs moisturizing, especially in winter months, but is prone to breakout. Have been using this for a couple weeks and no breakouts. My skin is more subtle and soft. It is nice and creamy and I now use it on other parts of my body. Was hoping for more of an improvement in skin tone (redness,etc) due to the Retynol. But if you want a quality face cream on a budget I'd give this a try. You won't waste your money trying it like other products since, as I mentioned about, you can use it as a body moisturizer. It is a generous jar of cream."
3,Quality OK but shirt runs small,Ordered this for my husband for Christmas. The quality of the material is fine but it runs about a size small. Just keep in mind when ordering.
2,doesn't fit right...,"i'm 6'4"" 220 lbs, and XL didn't fit me... weird shaped tshirt... sleeves are too big and torso is too small."
2,About what you'd expect for the cost,"I've bought these in bulk to house a custom product I sell, and I've had complaints from customers about the zipper getting stuck and the plastic clip for the shoulder strap breaking. I don't know how they'd work for cymbals but they obviously can't take much abuse."
4,Zildjian Cymbal Bag. So useful!,"It's a good bag, with space for many cymbals up to 20 inch.Its useful because you can carry your set anywhere, with no extra weight of a case or extra size."
5,Was worried!!,Exact replacement for our other Braun that died after 15 years. This model is not as loud nor is it hard to install. Good buy for our bathroom!
2,totally not for orthodox cooks,"I am terribly sorry to have to write this, but the author of the book is obviously not orthodox. Most of the recipes use matzoh meal and one even had FLOUR!! Orthodox jews don't use matzoh meal, or any vegetables that cannot be peeled. We don't use spinach, strawberries,etc., or matzoh for cooking or baking. We use potato starch for baking. It can't be used in the same quantity of flour because it's much thicker. There wasn't one single recipe using potato starch! For me, this cookbook is useless."
4,quality and price,The drivers arrived in good time. The quality is good and the price could not be beat.I would recommend them to anyone.
1,WHAT??,"This the way Jacqueline Rose describes the relationship between a suicide bomber and the victum""unbearable intimacy shared in their final moments by the suicide bomber and her or his victims. Suicide bombing is an act of passionate identification--you take the enemy with you in a deadly embrace.""The difference between the west and the Islamofacsists is that we do not see the innocent as the enemy. To the suicide bomber innocent women and children are the enemy just as much as the soldiers."
2,When?,When was it decided that for female jazz singers it only about slowing all songs way down and having a nice cover photo??? Jazz is meant to be more than music to fall asleep to. Ella and Billie probably could not get recording contracts today. ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
3,Action on a Budget,"Lou Fiamond Philips (The Wings Houser of the 21st Century) stars in this tribute to gunfire. He plays a mercenary hired to protect an obnoxious CEO from well armed bad guys who want to steal his company's latest invention. Action fans, who like to keep things simple, will love this film.Bullets start flying after the first few minutes and don't stop until the last 5 minutes of this shoot-em-up. Stuff blows up real good too. Money was spent on guns, knives and explosives, but little was spent on sets and dialog. All in all, this Striking Range isn't a total waste of time. Just don't expect much."
1,Memorex CDRW Discs,"I had a problem with these discs after purchasing at Staples.Because I am new to CD-R/CD-RW recording I thought it was allME, even though, initially my computer integrator gave meVerbatim CD-RW discs which were great, and, no problem.In searching for other matters on CD related internet newsgroupsI found I was not alone....regardless of software or hardware used in connection with these discs, there was no one who found favor with them and returned the discs to the retail store for credit or just dumped them rather than be bothered.There was a consistency with bad reports on Memorex and noothers I found after searching more than 30,000 postings.This can be verified by going to Google.com - newsgroup searchand typing in Memorex"
2,Not An Authoritative Documentary,"In The Grip Of Evil is an interesting little snippet of American occultism, but hardly an authoritative documentary on exorcism in the United States. However, the DVD may lead the viewer to take a more in depth look at occultism. If that's the case, I recommend Michael Cueno's book American Exorcism: Expelling Demons In The Land Of Plenty."
5,"Wonderful, useful","This changing pad is wonderful. I've been using it in place of a changing station for over 3 yrs and it works great. Two babies later and it's still going strong. If you're concerned about the surface, cover it with a receiving blanket or a towel before placing baby on it. The wipes container is a great addition as well since we make our own baby wipes."
4,When you outgrow the diaper bag!,"I don't know about you, but I was tired of carrying a huge diaper bag after my baby was born. I was also tired of feeling like a mom that couldn't carry her own purse because I had to carry the diaper bag. My husband gave me a huge beautiful purse for Xmas and got me this diapering kit to keep the diapers in my purse. So no more diaper bag, yes to nice purse! The diapering kit is great, it keeps 4 or so diapers and the area to change the baby is really big."
3,Has a strong plastic smell,"This is a perfectly functional portable changing kit that makes any bag a diaper bag. My biggest issue with this product however is that it has a very strong plastic smell to it, and even causes anything else it touches in my bag to have the same smell (i.e. blankets, change of clothes) I have had this kit for 3 months and the smell still exists. Because of this, I put a thin receiving blanket between the mat and my baby when changing her, but I still don't feel entirely 100% comfortable because of the smell. The only reason I keep using it is because I don't use it that often."
1,disappointment,"I love Idina Menzel, but I was disappointed in this CD because it wasn't what I expected. That's probably my fault for not checking into it more closely and listening to it in advance. It's nine different versions of ""Defying Gravity,"" but none of them anything like the original show tune. They're mostly hip-hop type versions with a lot of pounding bass and percussion with nothing else happening. I hated it and gave it away."
4,Powerful voice now in dance mix,"The lovely lady from Long Island with the powerful voice and electric personality is well represented with these remixed tracks of her showstopping song from WICKED, ""Defying Gravity."" Personally, I like Track 5 and the single version on Track 6 the best in this collection, but they're all enjoyable."
1,Don't buy this product. This item doesn't work!,When I received my Adaptor I was happy to finally be able to play my Ipod Shuffle in my car as it needed to be hooked to an adaptor. It didn't work. I then tried it in my home docking system for my Ipod and it didn't work there either. Basically I was stuck with a $20 piece of junk!!!!!
5,Politically correct death,"Wonderful book, lays out all arguments in a easy to read comprehensive way. Would recomend to anyone wanting to learn. :)"
3,"The Logic is Sharp, but there's no Heart","The people who give Beckwith's book 5 stars are correct: his arguements are good and sharp. They get to the heart of pro-choice reasoning and deflate it. However, we've had this sort of arguing for 25 plus years with no advancement. Better resources for the pro-life reader with a heart can be found in David C. Reardon's 3 books."
3,Not needed.,"I bought a couple of the workbooks in this series that I like. However, in them they give a strong sense that you need this teacher's manual in order to effectively use the workbooks. So I ordered this and found that the only thing it really adds is possible 3 minute discussion ideas on what the kids write about (Bible scriptures). The rest is common sense or already covered in the workbooks themselves.I admit that I'm really LAZY so I'll probably use their scripture questions (have to get my money's worth out of it after all), but for anyone else who doesn't already have this book, I would suggest for you to forego buying it and save your money."
5,Ted Andrew's Nature-Speak,"Ted Andrews provides powerful insights into how nature elements speak to us each day, if we pay attention to their messages. I recommend this book for anyone who loves spending time in nature."
1,Broke in the screw,"As seems to be the luck with this type of screw extractors they break. I had drill this partially out which was very difficult because it is made of very had metal. In all of this I discovered GraBits which work GREAT. Skip this old way of doing things. GraBits are amazing, I have used them for 3 broken screw extractions since this purchase and all have worked."
4,A classical wonder,"This comic strip inspired Bill Watterson's Calvin and Hobbes. The beauty of the strip is mainly in the presentation of the story, in the magic of the background landscapes, and in the poetry of the writing."
2,Eye of the Beholder,"Musty, dated, old boy humor of the kind floating around breakrooms and water-coolers. This stuff wasn't funny when the vaudeville hacks were doing it. I like Mr.Asimov, and probably would have been somewhat charmed by his delivery(maybe). All in all, read Benchley or Woody Allen again for literary laughs and leave Asimov for the 3000 other genres he dabbled in."
5,Superb collection!,"The ONLY humor compilation I've ever seen in which I laughed at almost all of the jokes. Asimov's commentaries are equally entertaining. Much better than the sequel, ""Asimov Laughs Again."""
5,Mom of 4 year old,"My son loves this DVD. He watches it at least once a day and is very happy with it. I'm not sure what the origianl cartoons looked like but watching for the first time, the cartoons look great to us."
3,Freestyle Funbox Watch,This Watch Freestyle Funbox 39490 Has a great stainless steel case and strap with extra adjustment.However it is let down by the white digits and black screen which on a bright day are hardly visible.The back light is perfect for dark days and night viewing.A better combination is the model 39411 with the stainless steel strap fitted which is interchangeable.However the 39411 back light is useless as it floods the screen with light making the digits invisible.You just cannot win!! Thanks William Higgins
1,"File under: ""Embarrassed that any trees died for this trash""","I also was forced to read this in the MBA program at USC and can vouch for the other former-student's review here. Our class also returned our copies of this book to the campus bookstore. If you are interested in making your workplace cutting-edge, look to Noel Tichy and Warren Bennis, for starters. If you're looking for negotiation and persuasion material, try Roger Fisher's brilliant ""Getting To Yes"" instead. This book isn't even bottom-of-the-birdcage material."
1,Nothing special,"My hair type is thick and prone to dryness on the ends. My hair is not overly damaged but this product actually made it feel damaged. I used this product ""correctly"" as another reviewer outlined and still got poor results. There is nothing special about this product, it might as well been from the dollar store. I have used many hair products from cheap to very expensive and this fell way near the lower end. After using it my hair felt straw-like and gross, something I had never experienced even when I do not use conditioner. It didn't even smell good. I couldn't find one thing I liked about this product. Will not be buying again."
2,Save your money,"This product (if it is indeed the actual product and not a knock off) does not work any better than Suave. I have fine-ish, straight hair and bought this thinking it would add shine. It didn't do anything. If you have hair that is coarser than mine, it will be a complete and utter waste."
4,Very good purchase!,The way this device works really surprised me. I was expecting a diferent techincal approach but it seems this is a very good one.The remote extender works. Period. It's nice to have 2 TVs and only one set top box and cont rol from my bedrorom the box in the living room seamesly. I'm saving a couple of bucks not renting the second box from Comocast!!!)Pros: It works.Cons:1) The receiver is kind of sensitive and sometimes produces erratic InfraRed signals (translation: the device to be controlled...does not respond)Workaround: Place the receiver away from any RF source and take advantage of the triple IR extender included in the package.2) The transmitter uses 2 tiny batteries. I have no idea how much is the replacement and how long wil last.Bottom line. Exactly what I needed. I am a very happy customer.
5,Do You Believe in the Sanctity of Thinking for Yourself?,"Having been brought up rigidly Catholic, I had always questioned why the message in the faith I attempted to practice seemed so far removed from what I actually felt to be true. The Gnostic gospel of St. Thomas has helped me understand that my own internal experience has value. It helped me realize that to feel the divine one look no further than within. The wisdom that inspired Jesus lies within all of us. This book has helped me better listen and trust the voice within."
3,More a review of the previous one.,"Pardon me, but I find it even harder to take advice from some backwoods hick who can't even spell the word british. I causes me to wonder if perhaps he had trouble reading it.I would further caution him that a many british cars are wired very differently than swamp buggies by having the ground opposite of the American standard. Perhaps that is one of the roots of his misunderstanding.I have found it very common for people who can't find another vent for thier limited imaginations to go to bash a book, album, movie, ect. Usually it more stems from a lack of understanding than anything else. For instance Haynes is a British Publisher, so one could reasonably expect a book from them to cover british cars. Perhaps he would be better served with Wiring Your Swamp Buggy published by Hooked on Phonics.Thank you."
4,Plus a change...,"Excellente lecture, Maupassant se surpasse dans ce roman, très près de notre réalité malgré les années d'écart entre l'action du livre et nos jours. C'est fou comme les époques ne changent rien aux comportements des hommes (au sens masculin du terme). Très belles images de l'Auvergne, on s'y croirait.Excellente représentation de la médecine et des médecins, malgré nos avancées technologiques, si peu de choses ont changées...Je ne vous en dis pas plus..."
5,Highly recommended!,This book is a must read for anyone who is planning on using a firearm for personal protection!
5,In The Gravest Extreme,This book was written in early 80's. I wore out my first copy. It give great insights on persoal defense and aftermath of self defense with handgun including legal ramifications. I am a NRA Instructor{PIsTOL}. This book should be presented and read by each student taking a self defense handgun course. It is Rated 5 Stars.
2,Good--But Dated,"Massad Ayoob is one of the best gun writers around. ""In The Gravest Extreme"" is the seminal work on the topic of concealed carry and the use of handguns for self-defense.Nevertheless, this book is in dire need of revision. It has not been updated since its publication in 1980. As a result, many popular new calibers (such as the .40 S&W; and the 10MM) and more recent gun designs (like the ever-popular GLOCK) are not covered. While the book still contains useful information on the justified use of deadly force and the basics of carrying a concealed weapon, it has been overshadowed by Chris Bird's ""The Concealed Handgun Manual"". Bird covers the same material as Ayoob, only in much greater depth and with an emphasis on more recent calibers and handgun innovations. Bird also goes into the many varieties of holsters availiable and discusses current concealed carry laws in all 50 states.In short, Ayoob's was a groundbreaking book--but Bird's is better and much more current."
3,OK that's all unless you are a rookie gun owner,Otherwise save your money and try and find some ammo now that this Government has it seems everyone in the US scared to death that they are gonna come gun grabbing and you know they are not that stupid.
5,This is a detailed scale model not a toy,"Typical Tamiya quality. I can't wait to paint and assemble it. The figures and motorcycle are very detailed and in good positions for a diarama or other display. I expect to spend about 10 hours painting and 1 hour assembling the kit, just so you know. If you don't paint it it will not look like the picture. Also the plastic is brittle, suitable for display only, not playing by children."
2,Interesting,"The beginning half of this book was amazing. I found great insights into the spiritual world. The second half seemed like a replay of the first with a few more details. This is the only spiritual book I've read. With nothing to compare it to, I'd say it's not a must but it was a good read, the first half anyway."
3,"Deck is ok, not great!","The product dimensions in the description makes it sound as though the cards are the larger size; they are not! The measurements given are for the box, and the box is much bigger than the cards! Who measures a box? The colors are somewhat drab compared to the deck I work with now, which is an older version. Every person interested in tarot, however, should own a Crowley deck. The images will bring about a better understanding of the cards. This deck is reasonably priced, and as another reviewer stated, the smaller size makes it easier to spread the cards. I bought this deck so I could frame my other deck, and that has worked nicely for me."
3,Cool...I think,"I bought these as a gift for someone and I'm going to be honest, the artwork is beautiful but beyond that I don't see what was so great about these. There are several, more reasonably prices Tarot decks out there that are even more beautiful than this one."
2,MEDIUM NOT SMALL,"The description of ""Small"" is misleading. This deck comes in three sizes and this is the MEDIUM one. I wanted another copy of this deck in the small version, and these arrived. Granted, I should have looked up the dimensions, but I was in a hurry and trusted the title. I read full-time and these medium and large decks are very hard on my hands. The truly small ones really work best. The Crowley deck is fantastic. Unfortunately, this seller is misrepresenting the size."
2,These cards are not small,"Thoth Tarot is the most impressing and beautiful tarot set to me. It is great art and very powerful symbolizm. The two stars apply to the given size: Small Tarot. I wanted to get some pocket sized cards to take with me. These cards are far from being small. They are regular sized, which with the Thoth Tarot is big already."
3,A lil disappointed on the vibrance of the colors...,"For some reason, the cards look more vibrant on Amazon, than in real life. Other than that, they were new, and received relatively quickly. ///"
4,got what i expected,not the vintage edition i was hoping for but the actual art is gorgeously colored and classic. the only drawback is the obnoxious white border around the edges of the backs of the cards.
4,Aleister Crowley predicted I would like these cards. :),Very nice colorful tarot cards... I would definitely recommend this set. You will not be disappointed in this set. :)
3,mission impossible,This 1st season was not near as good as the rest of the series. I think it is probably because Peter Graves was not brought in as the leader yet.
4,Love it - use it all the time!,"This juicer is fast and the machine is sturdy. It is definitely restaurant quality. Easy to clean which makes it so you do not hesitate to use it day after day. It makes pulp-free juice effortlessly. It is much better on harder fruits and veggies that soft ones, but still does fine with those."
2,Beware of the blades!,"I have had my Breville Elite for 24 days now. At first I was very happy with it. (Side Note)It is NOT for juicing leafy greens, wheat grass or any other budding plants, however they can be mashed together and it works a little bit. We used it exactally as directed and have kept it very clean, however about a week ago it started spitting out large whole chunks of fruit! It was just a few at first but the problem has just gotten worse and wore since then, and I am now having to attempt to re-juice all the pulp (however that does not work well either). I am on day 21 of a 60 day fast & can not just send it back in, I NEED it! I am very upset that I read all these wonderful reviews for it & yet should have paid attention to the few negative ones! Only 24 days and the blade has to be replaced?! Thats NOT worth $300!!!"
5,Breville Juicer,"This juicer is easy to assemble, easy to clean, makes fabulous juices in seconds and provides terrific compost for the garden. The mouth for the feeder tube is very wide and accommodates large fruits and vegetables easily. I've already made a lot of fruit and vegetable juices and haven't even had a hiccup with it. Well worth the money!! I have absolutely no complaints but you need to find enough space to store it. It is a bit tall."
1,Composting Organic Juice Money,Half of the juice is going into your compost bin. After you juice put a handful of the pulp in your hand and make a fist. Watch how much juice comes out. If you are buying organic produce you are wasting your money with this juicer. The juicer is built well but they sure didn't design it for juicing. Buy a Green Power or Green Star for the best juice results. Takes a little longer but over time you will save lots of money and your health.
5,Best juicer ever,"I loved this juicer so much I purchased one for my daughter. I have also recommended this to friends who have bought and loved it. It preforms fantantic, a little loud, but great and easy to clean."
5,BadASSSSss,"Had a Champion juice which was good but took so long to juice and clean. This juicer is perfect, regardless of how much juicing you do. Easy to clean, and pulp is much drier than from the Champion juicer. Breville sees to make a solid product. The BJE200XL is perfect if you only need 2-3 glasses."
5,Outsgtanding product Beautiful in your kitchen All stainless and built like a tank.,"Excellent, polite customer service and very speedy processing. This product received is exactly as pictured. I am pleased. Will order again from these nice people.I have used this every day. Makes perfect juice and I can put back no pulp / or as much pulp as I want. Excellent design!I am very pleased.No problems at all. Expensive but those Italians know how to design and manufacture a great quality product! Bless the Italians!"
3,"Good Juicer, but","I just bought this last night on Dec 6, 11 and tried it a couple of times.Pros:Quality Construction - I like the metal housing and other metal components.Pretty Quite OperationCons:It is relative bigHard to clean - The filter is really hard to clean. Foods get stuck to the filter and are hard to clean.It can be messy. The fruits and vege tends to get ejected out of the feed tube, so it can be pretty messy."
5,Fantastic Juicer should get 5+ stars.,"Believe it or not, but I am more impressed with this Juicer than with my 2006 BMW. It doesn't have built-in Bluetooth technology :), but it definitely has everything it needs to make juice. It is very easy to use and clean, has great motor power and fast motion, wide feeder is extremely useful for apples, carrots, etc. Whatever we had before is not even comparable to this commercial grade machine. I recommended this beauty to all my friends as a MUST HAVE. That's right - it is the best Juicer by quality, power and design! We use it almost every day, so we keep it on our countertop. It looks very stylish and most of our guests want to know more about this machine. A year after we bought it, it works as well as ever."
5,Breville refurbished juicer,"Works wonderfully, easy to clean, perfect on weekends when I don't want to get out of the house... It's like having Jamba Juice juices in house!"
2,No longer a Breville fan,"My Compact Breville was wearing down after a year and a half of heavy use, so I upgraded to the Breville 800. Very dissipoiting experience. First, the pulp of my greens was quite wet, (even after juicing on low as they suggest). Second, it sprayed juice out the sides where the cap fits over the pulp bucket. And third, the motor began to vibrate during my second use and got worse each use after that. I was thankful I was still within the thirty days. I sent it back and after further research I bought the Omega 8006. I can confidently say that after three weeks of use I love it. It is much easier to clean, with a higher quality of juice and dryer pulp."
4,breville juicer,it worked great but i bought it to make spaghetti sauce and it took too much of the pulp out.wish it came with a larger screen. check with the company and it doesn't.
2,"Nice, but messy due to pour design","This juicer has so many reviews that I just want to add that it is amazing, but creates a huge mess between the collection bin and juicer hood (see my pictures in the picture section).I went to the Breville trouble shooting section of the website and they recommend putting a plastic grocery store bag in the collection bin to help create a better seal. [...]REALLY? I $300 juicer that has such a pour design and/or tolerance of part fit that I need to augment it with a grocery bag? This is pretty weak, and the fact that it's #3 on the trouble shooting list I'm guessing that a lot of owners are having this problem.Shame on you Breville."
3,Not exactly what I'd hoped for,"I bought this juicer mostly for making apple juice. After reading the reviews I thought it was the answer to everything I had been looking for. The first batch I made was half juice and half froth. The next batch was less juice more froth. Reread the directions, cleaned the screen, even tried slowing the speed. Nothing really worked. Maybe it was the type of apple I was using. As I try different apples I'll add to this review if my results change. If you are buying it for apple juice, try to have plenty of strainers on hand to keep letting the batches sit and settle out. If you don't the juice has the consistency of very running applesauce. That being said, cleanup was simple due to most of the unit being stainless steel."
3,"Impressive, but not as efficient as it could be.","Don't be TOO impressed with how fast this juicer can perform, because it does have a few flaws. I've noticed that with softer fruits and veggies it wasted quite a bit of usable fruit. Tomatoes for example.. the pulp is extremely wet and the juice it yielded wasn't full bodied juice. It does a fantastic job with harder things like carrots and apples. Peaches/plumbs/grapes/tomatoes/kiwi all struggle a little (I feel like i'm wasting quite a bit of fruit).The quality of the juicer is great. No complaints here, and its very easy to clean (the noise doesn't bother me either.. quieter than most blenders). I guess if fruits and veggies weren't so pricey I wouldn't mind, but it seems like I'm wasting quite a bit using this.Otherwise it's a cool product."
5,Drinking sunshine daily,"Have never been a big vegetable eater. With this very reliabled juicer, am juicing vegetables daily!!! It's probably more juicer than one person needs, but am sure it will last me a lifetime!Somewhere in my Internet surfing picked up the idea of not having to ""wash"" a juicer everyday. I do rinse it in very hot water immediately after using it for a fast clean up, and then wash in dishwasher once a week. Am juicing kale, spinach, cucumbers, green onions, garlic, carrots, etc., and always 1/2 apple for sweetness (vary my vegetables to avoid developing allergies). Add Flaxseed Oil for the omega 3's.This is by far the most important purchase I've made for myself in years. All others purchases of jewelry, clothing, vehicles, etc. do not compare to the life sustaining nourishment my body will experience because of this juicer. Recently read where vegetable calcium absorbs better/faster than dairy calcium absorption. Important for someone like myself with osteopenia."
1,Worst Juicer I ever bought!!!,"Worst juicer I have ever owned and I have owned and used many in the last 25 yrs. Absolute piece of garbage, I was out of town when it was delivered and I never used it for about 40 days, hence the 30 day window was closed. Whenever I juice juicey veggies like tomatoes, it goes EVERYWHERE!!! I can not express enough how much I hate this juicer!!! It's currently up for sale on Craigslist."
3,Breviille - no longer my choice,"I bought this Juicer after watching the Joe Cross film: Fat, Sick and Nearly Dead. I loved what he had to say about the benifits of Juicing and bought the brand he was using. It does a great job on hard fruits and vegetables, it is very fast and the machine is easy to clean. However, using the slower speed for juicing leafy greeens such as spinach, swiss chard, kale and parsley (or even cantaloupe) this machine does not do a good job. Too much of the softer kinds of vegetables and fruits is discarded into the bin and not made into juice. Putting the pulp through a scecond time is messy."
3,Great for Carrots and fruits but bad for greens,"Greetings, I have the Norwalk and now this juicer. This juicer is fast. Very fast and it works well juicing carrots and any other veggie but greens. If you try to juice collard greens, kale, forget it!. I tried both slow and fast speeds and the pieces come out of the shoot in large chunks. You are lucky to get 1/4 of an ounce of juice from a whole head of greens. The Norwalk is a great juicer for all veggies including greens but it is time consuming. I will be going back to my Norwalk. Although it requires more time, at least I get all the juice out of my veggies....you save money!"
5,Now THIS is a Juicer I will use!,I bought an Omega juicer last year after reading all the great reviews about drier pulp and more juice per unit. Used it maybe 10 times but the prepping of the fruits and veggie to fit the small shoot and it seemed to take forever to make ONE glass of juice. That became tedious real fast so I put it away to gather dust. I admit I'm lazy and a fan of instant gratification so I will sacrifice a little less juice per squeeze for the speed and convenience of this juicer. (Clean-up was no problem either.)
5,GrillStone Grill cleaning bloock,Was very happy to find a product that makes life a little easier when on the grill. We still use our grill in the winter so it comes in handy.
3,some really good stories,There are a few really good stories in this book. The COBRA journal is awesome.
3,I have to agree...,"I must say, while this game did hold my attention because of the unique characters and funny dialogue, I was extremely disappointed with most everything else. When you move everyone around you moves as well, this is helpful in dungeons but in town...? It can get really annoying... Dying and losing everything you've gotten from the beginning of that dungeon is really really annoying as well. Money is really easy to come by and I didn't mind going in the dungeons just to level so I could try to get farther but the attack and defense system kinda sucks.. Even if you have a weapon with 120 attack you don't do much more damage and there doesn't seem to be a reason to level.Overall I wouldn't recommend this game for people that like RPG-style games, where you level and get better items or whatever to get stronger. I would recommend this game for people that thoroughly enjoy dungeon-crawlers for more than a couple of hours."
3,It is what it says it is,"Recommended by a friend because of mutual interests. It was an interesting book, but not what I had expected.I would have appreciated what I thought it would be; more historical events and accounts of activities, rather than telling me how to become a spy.Nonetheless I found much of interest in this well written book"
3,Praise for the first half!!!,"The first half of this book was exciting, entertaining and full of promise. Though the second half jumped off the ride and became boring. I don't know what happened. I've never seen a book do this. Weird. a 5 out of 10."
5,Love at first click.,"I love this camera. Color is great, detail is sharp and is has lots of settings to fiddle with. The only downside is, yes you may have heard this before, the battery life. The two that come with it plus an 8 pack of very good batteries lasted exactly 459 shots. That's about 91.8 shots per set if you are keeping score. That is with lots of zooming, flashing, and fidgeting with the setting. BTW if get the ""battery exhausted"" messages appears you can turn it off and let it sit for few minutes and get a few more shots. The CRC-V3 recharables has lasted 200+ so far (they just came in). Well worth it. The flash also charges faster. The LCD is accurate and has no dead pixels. It is also smaller than I realized. Basicly, get this camera, the case, a set of CRC-V3s, and a 256MB SD card and you will have everything you need."
4,Great little camera...,"I was in search of a camera to replace my HP315 (ok, ok stop laughing at me now!) that was about 5 years old. I just decided that I need to start taking more pics of my 5 year old before he's off to college or something!I wanted a camera that was 3MP or so. I didn't want or need anything more than that. Higher MPs just eat up your memory and take forever to download pics via email. I read the Consumers guides, testimonials here on Amazon and went out to look for the best price. My sister has the 3100 so I knew a little bit about the camera as well from using hers and loved it.It's a great little camera with about 16MB of internal memory in case you forgot a SD card or run out. SD cards are dropping in price all the time. But it was the FREE SD card that came with this camera at Amazon that sold me.So now I take pics and stick them on the computer in a slide show so my little guy can see himself and his buddies. He was adorable in his Halloween costume!"
4,Great camera....,"I love this camera! The picture it takes are wonderful quality, very clear and the color is great. My only complaint, which i guess is a big one is the battery life. After having the camera for one day, playing around with it and getting familiar, the battery light already went on. We bought rechargeable batteries and a charger, which makes it better, but I would have preferred a camera that could be charged directly.Aside from this though, the camera is great and works great on the fly."
2,Very poor low-light focusing,"I wanted to like this camera. It's my second digital camera, and after a fair amount of research into small 3.2MP models, I bought it before a two-week vacation that culminated in a wedding. On the trip, I took some 350 pictures and also made a few short videos. When the camera works, it works very well, but I found that it was almost impossible to get it to focus in low light, i.e., lighting where a flash is needed. Furthermore, after several seconds of pressing the shutter release and having it fail to focus, I'd lower the camera, only to have it focus on the floor and take a picture at that time. I ended up with a lot of pictures of the floor. The video feature works quite nicely, and the various ""scene"" modes do well, too, but when the lighting got tough, this camera gave me nothing but frustration. I'm returning it tomorrow."
5,"thank you so much, Santa!","This is my first digital camera. The day it arrived my husband and I were leaving for a trip to Jamaica. A friend of mine already had one, so we ran by her house for some quick tips on the way out of town. It took her 5 minutes to show me the basics, and I was taking pics like a pro!!! I love this camera; I've been taking so many more pictures of my kids since I got it. I highly recommend it especially for people new to digital cameras. We even recorded a couple of short movies with it in Jamaica. It's SO easy to use!!!"
3,"Excellent coffee, not all that exotic, though...","I love my coffee, and because of that, I have tried lots and lots of varieties although I began as a simple Folgers fantatic. Jamaican Mountain Blue Coffee has been touted to be the best of the best world coffees out there by such highly esteemed sources as the Food Network and the kitchens of the White House.I found the low acidity of the coffee very refreshing, but the darkness of this roast has not allowed a lot of subtleness of the flavor to come out. To me, this tastes like Folgers at its best, but nothing more than that. Great for everyday drinking, because it is smooth and rich and leaves little acid ""bite."" But still, after having tried Kona coffee with its myriad of subtle flavors, I found Blue Mountain kinda boring.I guess I disagree with experts, but hey, my coffee is important and taste is everything! If you like exotic flavors, this isn't it. But it you would like to have consistently smooth, rich, honest coffee, this is the one."
3,Blue Mountain Experience,"I am a coffee lover of many years and as such am always interested in finding good coffees. This was my first time to try blue mountain, and purchasing it with a gift certificate allowed me to be a bit more extravagant than I otherwise would have been.While the coffee is good, I don't find it to be superior to other coffees I have ordered which are considerably less expensive."
3,Don't believe the hype...,"Went to Jamaica last May and brought about 6 pounds of this and the Waldenford's Blue Mtn back with me. About half what you are paying here, but still not worth the money. It is good coffee. No question. But don't believe all the hype. I am a casual coffee drinker and someone that takes coffee more seriously might get more benefit from this coffee. To me, not the case. I order my Peet's Arabian Mocha Java online for about $14/lb and it is still my favorite coffee."
3,It's Alright,"Honestly, this video was ok. I was a little bit disappointed by the lack of content. Now, what he talks about is certainly important (different strokes, relaxed technique, etc), but most of it can be gathered without the video. If you are just starting to drum, these might be good foundational instructions. I would probably just recommend going to watch the videos at vicfirth.com."
3,"Great picture for DVD, but bad sound quality",This set has great picture quality for DVD (with S-Video input). Butthe sound quality is quite bad. Too much echo even with surround sound turned off. No adjustment will cure the problem. I can bearly hear the newscaster reading because of echo. I am not picky on audio nor trying to build a home theater system. But this problem is going to make me to return it.
4,Bigger is not always better,"I've had this television for almost 6 months now, and while I've enjoyed the large picture (the largest for a tube tv), I have one problem. There are horizontal lines of light and dark that scroll up the screen when watching DVD movies. I have used RCA cables, S-video, and a coaxial, and they all have the same problem. The problem is most obvious in the black bar areas above and below the picture in a widescreen movie. Panasonic boasts about the Panablack technology, but that is really the main drawback to this televsion. I don't know about the sound because I use home theatre sound, but the speakers are small to keep the set from being a monstrosity like the Sony Trinitron Wega. The other thing this set lacks is component video inputs. That would allow me to try one more option to get rid of those lines, but now that I've sunk over $1,000 into this set, I guess I can live with it."
5,An excellent collection of contemporary haiku.,"800 'haiku moments'! in one book. Recommended to haiku writers everywhere, not just in the US. A wide range of topics covered. The introduction will interest both experienced haikuists and beginners. Excellent haiku many by famous names, not readily available elsewhere."
1,dows not work at all,"I bought the game,installed it starts and after 10 seconds kicks me out of teh game,every single time."
5,Mazatlan IS Paradise,"This book was essential during my travel plannning to Mazatlan. Charles Hall covers every little detail. The only book that I found on Mazatlan only. All others included other beach resorts or the entire Pacific Mexico, etc. A must read if going to Mazatlan."
5,Great Overview of Mazatlan,"Of all the guidebooks I've every bought, this one proved the most useful of any. From restaurant reviews to medical or real estate info, this book delivers. Written by a person who really knows Mazatlan. I highly recommend it to anyone traveling to Mazatlan. Also just an enjoyable format that makes me want to meet the author."
3,"Some victories, some disappointments","Victories:Time/date, updated daily/In-Out Temp(neat!)/clock alarm/Projects the time on ceiling.(My goal in purchase.)Disappointments:That's good(time on ceiling)BECAUSE the color/temp. face display hasn't displayed after three weeks. The radio/speakers are weak in quality/reception. The snooze alarm is only a beep not the radio."
5,Some Pukka food by a Lovely Jubly Person!,"Jaime Oliver has continued to amaze me with his brillient cooking styles and fantasic ideas. I just recently made his Minestrone soup and it was really good! His book doesn't just tell you about his cooking, but also fills you in on his history. Two thumbs up!"
2,"Much Attitude, Little Content","This cookbook may be appropriate for beginners, but anyone who owns any other cookbooks, especially Italian ones, will be disappointed. The recipes are exceedingly simplistic (handfuls of herbs with everthing) and not unique or inventive in the least. Save your money and look elsewhere."
2,False Advertisement,"I was going to have a dinner party and decided to get a book to help me along. Being the district leader of like-minded ""swingers"" this book seemed destined for my shelves. So I got online and ordered up a copy this is where the disappointment began. Ripping open my box I found a smallish book with a rather homely British woman on the cover. I didn't let this discourage me so I opened it up looking for the glossy pages of naked culinary artists. ""WHAT!"" I exclaimed. There was not a single photo in the entire book. How was I supposed to figure out what food worked best on the human body without this aid. Furthermore, there was not one reference to the erotic properties of food. I could not figure out why the illusions to nudity were attached to this book. Finally, I sat down and produced some of the recipes in the book, which were decent at best. My party went well but the book did not help. I guess the old saying about not judging a book by its cover is true."
5,Great recipies and enjoyable reading,"Ok I'll admit that the recipes in this book are simple. However, that doesn't mean the flavors are simple. Some of the best recipes out there are ones that use fresh and simple ingredients, which is the premise behind this book. The recipes are good and most are relatively easy to make. Oliver combines great ingredients together to create good food and that's what good cooking is all about. While this book is great for a relative beginner to the kitchen, I think that experienced cooks will also gain some inspiration from it and truly appreciate the message that Oliver is trying to get across, which is that good food doesn't have to be complex and expensive."
4,Tasty food from a tasty-looking bloke,"Is there any TV chef cuter than this guy? Well, no. And I think that's why he probably got the job. His cooking, while not revolutionary, is simple and good, but probably wouldn't have attracted a shred of attention if it was prepared by a homely fat guy with acne scars. That said, I enjoy this book very much--it's well photographed, the recipes are explained in detail, and it's practical enough to use on weeknights and impressive enough for special occasions. I'll probably sign on for the next installment."
1,robert jordan is not a conan writer.,"Avoid. Shun. This will not attract you to Conan, the mythical Cimmerian superman. The Conan Chronicles are a disgrace to Robert E. Howard and a slur on his name. All three novels are basically the same. Robert Jordan has only rehashed the same plot and cliches over and over again in three separate tomes. To qualify how bad these three novels are, re read the criticism levelled against mr Jordan in the last sentence. Any Conan reader will know that the plot is always very predictable and that each novel is full of a standard set of cliches. This reflects on the new lows that Robert Jordan has succumbed to in his pathetic attempt to write on one if not the, greatest fantasy super hero."
4,Good for what it is,"After reading 10,000 some odd pages of the wheel of time, part of me expected this to feel the same way. But these were certainly Conan stories. Each of these three stories were pretty much the same, kind of like watching three scooby doo episodes in a row: there is an evil socrerer working to enslave the world. Conan, along with another characterized warrior type, a handful of nameless fighters and a beautiful woman, get in the way of the sorcerer's plans. It's not as good as Robert E Howard, but entertaining IF thats what you're looking for (like scooby doo)"
4,excellent resource for overlooking capabilites of tech.,"I found it well organized and providing a very good overview of present technology, ideas and devices available today.No math, but a lot of good illustrations and concepts."
2,"Bleh, no likey","Didn't like the hymns in this CD. Alot of droning, whining chanting. Unless you want a headache, and to get really annoyed, don't bother...."
5,Sublime,But why don't you have the television series available on DVD.A must for any civilized person.
2,"Bronowski - 5 stars, HIGH-QUALITY-BOOKS - 0 stars","What part of ""Condition: New"" did I not understand?The dust jacket is indeed new (big deal), but the book's cover is very worn on the edges and the book itself hardly ""new"". Very disappointing because it was to be a gift for my husband who has wanted this book all these many years. So what did I expect? Honesty!"
5,Another Great Michael Douglas flick,"Michael Douglas does it again this time as money hungry buisnessman whos buisness is going down the drain. Gwyneth Paltrow plays his two timing wife who has 100 million dollars at stake and is having an affair with Viggo Mortenson. Douglas finds out and decides to Paltrow killed by Mortenson. After a bad attempt that emotionally scars Paltrow, Douglas kills Mortenson and decides to take matters into his own hands. This powerful thriller is sure to leave you breathless."
5,A Good Murder Mystery,"To make a long story short, if you only ever own one Michael Douglas movie on dvd, it should be this one! Great story, great movie!"
2,", not for the self guided tour","I am currently in China, after reading a review on Amazon decided to buy Fodor's instead of lonely planet, am sorry I did. The information in the book is of value if you are with a tour, or planning the overall itenerary but it is not to helpful when it comes to details. Most of the hotels and such are for the more upscale traveler, with out much for the budget or midrange traveler, I ended up borrowing Let's go China from a traveler who was leaving and I ask others I meet who have the lonely planet if I can read a bit. Also another problem is there are no chinese characters in the text, so you can't show the taxi driver where you want to go, and most haven't mastered reading the romanized chinese with the proper accent or inflection. If you are with a tour, maybe fodors is OK, but otherwise go with LP, it has picture too, Fodor's dosen't."
1,Bad unit.,This unit is very loud. It puts out very little heat. We only had it a couple of weeks before it burned out. Only had about an hour and fifteen minutes on it. This unit is a very bad purchase.
4,Not sure if it works yet!,"My dogs definitely like eating their food with this on top, like a gravy. I am not sure if it actually works though. I am optimistic about Optima though ;)"
5,BRILLIANT SATIRE,"This little book is a masterpiece of satire about the author's homeland. Babba G. Jallow, former editor of a leading newspaper the The Gambia, brilliantly chronicles the struggle for democracy in that West African country. From independence to the present, he exposes corruption and traces the rise of ""Powercacy"", which he defines as ""government of the powerful, for the powerful, and by the powerful."" Anyone not familiar with politics in developing countries will be amazed at the extent of corruption and the suffering of the citizens. I would have found the book amusing if I had not lived in such a country and witnessed some of what Mr. Jallow describes. It is heartbreaking to realize that the conditions he vividly describes is the rule rather than the excpetion in developing coutnries. Therefore, it is a very sad commentary."
5,unique and constantly updated,"This book contains a list of publications which deal with the prehistory and early dynastic period of Egypt and Northern Sudan. The indexed books, articles and dissertations relate to history, art, geology, flora, fauna and many more subjects. Alphabetically listed by the author's name, the reader will find references written in English, German, French, Spanish and Italian, as well as Chinese, Arab, Russian, Japanese and Polish. New additions to the book can be found in the *Archeo-Nil* journal. Are included topographical and thematic indexes, as well as a map which facilitate finding the area of interest. This is an excellent book of references both for the student and researcher to own."
5,Very Pretty,"These earrings are very pretty. I expected them to be heavy, but they feel fine. I have gotten many compliments when i wear them. You wont be disappointed."
2,not as good as Creasy's,"I highly recommend William Creasy's translation over this one. This is a struggle to read and relate to. Creasy's is smooth, easy to read and far more encouraging."
5,The Imitation of Christ,"This book is fantastic if it is your desire to walk as He walked and at least try, to be like Him. I highly recommend it."
2,Fits and starts,"Don't look for great dance numbers -- there aren't any. Just a lot of jumping around, really. And the music is okay. Like a lot of religious rock, the drive to quote the gospels exactly makes most of the lyrics weigh down like lead... ""Day By Day"" being a glorious exception, even if it really only has one verse. But for all of that, there are some really stunning moments in this video. And the cinematography is very, very good, and the actors are very earnest, real believers, and that comes across very well. This show has lots of energy!"
5,This movie was as good as I remembered it!,"For those of you who like musicals, religious or not, the score to this movie is absolutely incredible!!I try not to pay too much attention to the artsy-fartsy modern day ""imagerie"". Even so, seeing the clothes from back then is a real hoot!"
2,Our Jesus Freaks?,"Confined to the suspended world of the stage it might have been palatable, maybe even good, in it's era. But on screen it comes off more like a 90-minute promotional for cult indoctrination. Rent ""Ticket to Heaven"" and compare. Makes your skin crawl....."
5,Life Changing!,I saw Godspell when I was in high school many years ago. It totally turned me on to the power of love and caused me to go to church to learn more about Jesus. The music and the modern day New York scenes were fantastic.
4,A much more positive alternative to Jesus Christ Superstar,"I've been a fan of Godspell since I first saw it on the stage (about a year before the movie came out, I think). While the professional stage productions were generally better, the movie is still very good.One warning: you have to approach it with your mind in a very abstract mode. Some have mentioned the fact that John the Baptist and Judas are played by the same actor: in fact, the only actor that I've noticed having any fixed identity is Jesus. The others seem to move in and out of the roles of specific Biblical characters as the scene warrants. And you have to understand that they're not making fun of the Bible - rather, they're showing a side of Jesus that, although it certainly existed, is rarely portrayed: the humor, the happiness, the kind teacher rather than the stern lecturer."
1,cringeworthy and creepy,"i saw this movie as a child decades ago and remember it as bizarre and tedious. i thought to give it another shot since my 6year old loves daddy warbucks in annie. well his much younger self has an afro, wears clownclothes, and has clockwork orange facepaint. the other very amateurish characters declaim and act out buffoonishly and i just felt embarrassed for them. the musical numbers are the only watchable parts of the movie so maybe 15 minutes of mediocre entertainment out of the lot. i don't understand how it got so many good reviews, it is horrible."
4,Exhilarating!,"Godspell is not a perfect movie, but something about the music, the silliness, the gentle innocence and the abundant feeling of love pulsing through the film just touches my soul! It's a bit dated, but I've loved it since it came out in 1973. The film helps modern-day audiences relate more to the character of Jesus, and the warmth that emanates from Victor Garber and his friendship / love for his followers really comes across in a way that speaks the real meaning of Christianity. ""Day by Day"" and ""By My Side"" bring tears to my eyes every time I hear them. Highly recommend this video for those with an open mind and an open ear."
3,Godspell,"was a little strange, nostalgic look at the hippie era...my kids loved it they've watched it 10 times"
1,makita mac700 2hp air compressor,"i purchased this compressor about a year ago from amazon..im a contractor and need a good durable compressor that i can use everyday..this is not a durable unit..i got to use it for two days and they wernt consecutive..the first day i had it on my truck it tipped over,breaking the oil cap and the week brass connector on the tank...i fixed these items and tried it again...the very next day the oil site glass got broken and the same brass fitting got sheered off again..i wont fix it again..way to fragil to be considered portable..very tippy and nothing is protected if you bump into it with anything(except maybe a pillow)it will break..."
1,Surprise! Arrived damaged,I will have to echo what others have said. My Mac 700 arrived damaged with a cracked crankcase cover. Not packaged well enough for it's weight and very vunerable to damage. Makita has a problem here! Why make a great product (so I've heard) and not protect it properly for shipping?I sure would love to see for myself how well it works.
5,Best Compressor for the money,I did a lot of homework regarding Air Compressors before I bought this one. I decided to go with an oil-filled compressor due to the low noise level and the simple fact of longevity. This compressor fills extremely fast and puts out a decent CFM at 90 psi. I looked at sears for comparable units and couldn't find one with good buyer reviews. This is my first Makita product and I am absolutely satisfied. Plus free shipping- can't beat it.
2,makita MAC700,Like many others my compressor arrived with the plastic shroud in seven pieces. It would not take much to correct the packaging to prevent this from hapening. One of those inflated plastic bubles taped to the front of the shroud would stop the leading edge of the shroud from hitting the cardboard insert and putting enough pressure on it to cause it to break. Putting large red arrows on the box and printing this end up in large letters would also help as the small red arrows are easily overlooked. My unit came with oil all over the cardboard insert and an imprint of where the leading edge of the shroud had pressed into the cardboard. This was a good indication that the box had been laid on its side. I also own the MAC2400 which is great but really heavy. As Amazon will not replace this unit I have returned it and have ordered another from Home Depot.Com for the same amount plus sales tax. I hope this one comes in one piece.
4,All that I need,"Reviewers said it was quiet for a 2 HP unit. It certainly is. Got up to full pressure quickly. I've bought a lot of air tools, supplies and associated equipment and need a unit I can move around easily. It fills the bill."
4,Well made compressor for smaller jobs,"This is my third compressor, and my first Makita and first oil compressor.I was impressed by the quailty of construction of this compressor. It is also very quiet with little vibration.I recently used it to power my Hitachi full head framing nailer. While it produced enough air for the gun, you have to go a bit slower than if you had a twin tank unit. It is best suited for smaller jobs when using a framing nailer or for use with any trim/brad nailer.I was so impressed with the quailty of this Makita that I plan to get rid of my Porter Cable twin tank and get the Makita twin tank unit for use with my framing nailer."
1,"Save Your Time and Money - Avoid This One, It WILL Arrive Broken","Take a cue from the reviews - as I should have. Even the new packaging is unable to protect this compressor from normal handling in transit. Mine arrived with the plastic housing that routes air from the fan over the cylinder shattered. Since this will materially affect the cooling effectiveness of the fan and therefore shorten the service life of the compressor, this is a non-trivial problem. Back it goes. I'll order something else that stands a better chance of arriving unbroken. By the way: there was no external indication of damage, the box was perfect on the outside."
1,No photos on Kindle version,I ordered the Kindle version and returned it as there were zero photographs. I opened it on my Mac. Perhaps they show up on the iPad... but not on the Mac or the iPhone.
3,"A promising start, but...","After seeing the first episode I was quite pleased with this one. It had a nice storyline, well drawn characters and animation, it's quite good mixture of fantasy-romantic-comedy (father and mother in heaven! ). However the second episode is a completely different case. It seems the the production company itself changed. The story gets dull, the characters change a bit, and the animation is nothing compared to the first episode. No wonder they didn't make any more of it. In a nutshell the first episode is great, I can recommend it to every anime fan, however the second episode you must approach with caution, it's something else."
1,Not as expected,Sent back after taking it out of the box. Not as big or as heavy as I thought it would be. VERY disappointed :(
3,Informative but dated,Being a Tolkien fan I was somewhat let down by this documentary. It was very dated and was made pre-Peter Jackson LOTR and Hobbit. It missed the mark on literature influences for Tolkien's Middle Earth (i.e. Beowulf). I also wish it would have touched on his relationship with C.S. Lewis and how that helped influence his writings.
5,Great watch!,"I purchased this watch to replace an earlier Seiko I wore for years. I always wanted to try a kinetic energy type from Seiko. When it forst arrived I was disappointed that the second hand was clicking in two-second intervals. I learned that this is a warning feature of the watch that alerts you that it has limited kinetic energy stored in the watch. After wearing it for a few days, the watch began running normally (one click for one second). I really like the watch. I wear it both in work and casual situations. It runs great - it looks even better. I got a great price on amazon.com!"
5,Seiko,"I really like the watch it looks good, feels good on my wrist and keeps extremely accurate time (gains about 4 sec per month). The price of $[...] at amazon.com was very good compared to others I found in local stores or on the web."
2,Very Heavy,"I bought this watch for its feature. Though it is very nice, it is heavy. It's not for me."
3,Almost a great watch,"I wear this watch whenever I'm not working. Since I work all the time, I get to wear it to and from work and on my occasional off day. It has still managed to wind itself up almost to full capacity without having one of those nightstand winder things.UPDATE - Already stopped working. I even got a watch winder as a gift, but it still doesn't charge up the watch."
1,Bleh,"You may like this film, if: you love it when the main character's most defining aspect consists of having a beard; you like preposterous Man vs. Nature storylines that are unrealistically weighted toward the man (having been written by a man of course); you love stories that show the strength, fortitude, and ingenuity of the Soviet People; you like scenes when someone goes lost and the others wander around calling their name for 4 minutes; you're so enamoured of the director's other film, The Cranes Are Flying that you are willing to overlook the obvious flaws of this one; you think that good cinematography alone can constitute a good film. Otherwise this is a total wash. I would give it 2 stars but someone has to counteract the over-enthusiastic 5 star reviews. Letter Never Sent?-- more like The Blu-ray I Wish I Hadn't Bought."
1,Highly dissapointed,"I purchased this book with the intention of reading gritty tales of growing up in the South, not lesbian porn. I do not have a problem with Ms. Allison's sexual preference; some of what she had to say about being a lesbian was interesting. However, I found this book to be pornographic and disgusting. I did not realize that 80% of this book was detailed sexual encounters. For example, one story describes her partner urinating on her face. I do not recommend this book."
4,the metal craft book,"I thought this book had alot of very good information for someone new to metal work. I loved the instructions for how to achieve different patinas. Most of the 50 projects were very good, and the instructions were easy to follow. All in all it is a fun craft book."
2,"Great Players, Not A Great Book","If this book had a flavor, it would be pure vanilla. Cliff and Charlie were players who drank the purple kool-aid and totally bought into the Tom Landry system. As a result, this is not a tell-all book, and I found myself on the edge of boredom with insights like these.1. How hard Cliff and Charlie practiced and got in shape. Yawn!2. Earl Campbell was really tough and hard to tackle. Wow, what insight!3. Walter Payton was really quick and hard to tackle. Didn't know that!4. Those Super Bowls against the Steelers were really close. What a revelation!This is a typical innocuous book similar to ""The Johnny Bench Story"" that I read at the library when I was 8 years old."
3,Lost interest - never finished it.,"Found it hard slugging...too slow. Only read part of it, and put it down. Lost interest...so I never finished it."
5,I'm hearing voices,As I read this book I could hear the voices of the actors from the A&E series. It makes me like both more. I have never watch a book adapted for screen that compliments the book so well. It is hard to put into words how good this book is. I will say it in the simplest way possible. It is a refreshingly simple kind of complex.
3,Review of The Cold Dish: A Walt Longmire Mystery,The plot of this book was good and the characters were also good but did not like the bad language
3,Bad language was annoying.,Often the speaker was only identified after a lot of dialogue. That interfered with getting the characters at first. Good who dun it...but no way for hero to make two trips from mirror lake carrying a grown man each time in the story line allotted...guess that's the way with fiction.
2,I returned it,"I bought this as a 2nd monitor for my iMac G5 (yes you can have two monitors with an iMac - google it - ) and the color balance was not good, neither was the contrast. I adjusted everything I could but the colors just did not come close to the iMac ... so ... even though it was a great price... I had to send it back."
1,Worthless Junk,"I bought the set about one week ago. I needed something affordable to open up my laptop. Within the first three screws taken off of my laptop, the screwdriver broke. The tip came loose from the main body of the screwdriver. This rendered the tool worthless. I decided to use the next size up for the rest of the screws. After a few more minutes, the second screwdriver tip broke off, just like the first one. After a frustrating half hour of trying to re-glue the tips back onto the bodies, I noticed that the majority of the other screwdrivers and torque drivers were freaking BENT! Out of the 16 pieces, only 3 were straight. Now if you try to use a screwdriver that is bent to one side, it'll probably turn your 5 minutes project into an ordeal. Anyway, I am now back on the market for yet another set of precision screwdrivers."
2,Very poor quality; broke on first use,"Super cheap quality, rather cheap price. Not a good product. I used one of the screwdrivers to open a computer case and it broke, letting the handle spin in place while the tip was stationary. This set isn't worth $5."
5,"Well made, useful, priced well","These well made, sturdy tools. I would think of them as an all purpose small screwdriver set, there are no tiny drivers like a jewelers kit - but these are sturdy, come with flat, philips, socket, and torx. The case is useful. It's a good set and really solid value. Only downside was a little assembly lube in a few places on them."
2,"small, but not precision",The smallest Phillips driver had the tip ground down too far and wouldn't work. I actually got the set because I needed that particular driver. They are probably OK if you just want an assortment of small cheap screwdrivers. But they are not a precision screwdriver set.
2,Looked really cool but...,It broke after a single use. I tried to pull out the battery tray but it just broke into pieces and tore a wire out. Terrible quality.
1,Didnt even work when i got it,"Dont buy this, waste of money for sure!!Go to spencers and get one for less and it will work"
3,"for 80s throwback, its >ok<","I heard a track on XM and liked it so much that I bought it. But overall, the album didnt grab me. I dont know if its because it wasnt catchy enough or didnt have the right overall sound. Probably both. It just wasnt for me. They claim to not have 80s influences like Simple Minds, and I believe them. But the similarities are there. I wished it were better."
1,Junk - no bargain,"So much for a bargain car charger. Bought it from Eforcity, the wire strain gauge at the phone plug broke in about 6 weeks of light use, now it's headed for a landfill. No exchange allowed by the retailer since past 30 days.Stay away, it's not the bargain it would seem to be."
3,A Story that has been told-sort of,"Classic story of a white guy named Rob (Brandon Karrer) helping a young boy named Marcus (Cosby Show & Even Steven's) Gary Gray learn something. This time it's photograph since Rob discover's Marcus's love of photography. That's Story A-The other story is Marcus's brother, Keith played by (The Wood)Trent Cameron leanrs that his girlfriend is pregant by another guy. He and his friends played by Garikayi Mutambirwa (Clock Stoppers), Arvie Lowe Jr. (Lizzie Mcguire) and Lloyd Avery find the guy and kill him. Eventually Rob befriends Keith and begans to hang out with Keith's friends. When a drug raid goes bad and results in Rob getting pictures, Keith's friends think he is going to tell the police. The final ten minutes show the power of trust among friends. The movie does have vilence, language and brief nudity from Mr. Lowe."
3,Did not change to EST,I purchased this clock in Nov. of 2011. I bought it because of constant power outages in my area. I wanted a clock I could depend on for accurate time. It changed to DST (East Coast) correctly however it failed to change to EST today 11/4/2012. This is a disappointment. I do not feel I can trust this clock now. Just for reference it is in the same location. I have not moved it and the signal is strong.
1,A piece of junk,A cheap piece of plastic. Impossible to understand the instructions. Very confusing and written in broken English. This thing is going back immediately. A total waste of money.
3,Clock,"Fast service. Great product, but to see the clock at night, the clock should have a back light, as it is impossible to see what time it is at night time."
5,Clock Fits Our Needs,We have a 96-year old mother. This clock seems to be carefree and has the information she needs in large print. Perfect.
4,great gift,This book is excellent for beginner drinkers who attend bars. This book includes just about every mixed drink out there; plus more. It provides the reader with great detail as to what certain ingredients are and different variations of a particular drink. GREAT GREAT pocket book.
1,Not very good for beginners,This book lists drinks only by their main alcohol ingredient ONLY. Not very helpful if you don't know the drink's main alcohol ingredient. What kind of bartender bible doesn't have a recipe for a cosmopolitan? Is an alphabetical list of all the dinks in the book too much to ask? Every time I use this book I get pissed off.
2,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!,"With all the great classic cocktail books out there, I wonder why it is necessary for everybody to try to do a ""me-to"" version. Many technical errors and incorrect information. Why bother?"
4,"What, no Hurricane?","This is a dandy book, great mainly for its advice on setting up your home bar. It's got all the real classics -- the Gibson, the Manhattan, the Negroni, the Gimlet, the Sazerac... but most of its trendy modern mixed drinks are clearly English (the names are often the give-away). An interesting picture of what they're drinking in England, but I was surprised at what I /didn't/ find (the above-mentioned Hurricane, for example)."
5,great game,Very nice and simple game that builds up addition skills yet involves planning and strategy. Good for the young and old with a hint of risk taking adventure
5,Not as bad as I'd thought,"From various sources, I thought this book would be useless, and impossible to implement. Instead, it has monsters that are in fact easy to add to even lower-level campaigns. There are a few drow-related monsters, which are probably of little use to anyone not inside a Forgotten Realms campaign, but an enterprising DM could add them to an existing campaign without mentioning their origins at all.To sum it up, I am sorry that so many people recommended not buying this book, because I would have liked to have had it sooner rather than later."
1,Thoroughly Purposeless,"It seems to me that this was the product of ""Gee, we just finished making money off the monster manual. How can we make some more? Let's just shuffle it around and publish it again!"" This book is more or less just a nearly totally random collection of monsters. Some fiends here, an undead there, one totally random celestial, with absolutely no unifying theme or purpose. The monsters themselves are, as usual, well described, well thought out, and many have rather good illustrations as well. However, ""What's the point?"" is the question that surrounds this book. If you have the opportunity to pick this up for a couple bucks, then it might make sense, as this book, with its few new worthwhile additions and lots of pointless rehashes, is about the D&D equivalent of a 10 cent yard sale grab bag."
3,Audible breathing is very distracting,"I don't disagree with the five-star reviews, but technically the recordings are spoiled for me by the clearly audible breathing of the soloist."
1,Would not recommend this!!!!,"We bought this for our son for Christmas. We are not happy with it at all!! There are a couple or resons why,first the instructions were in German with very little english because it's made in Germany,the phone number that was listed if you had any problems is a internation number,and the Dumper in the front will not stay on!!! Our son got very frustrated with it because when he went to dump a toy out of it,it keeps falling off. It is not worth the money that we spent on this nor the frustration that our son has with it!!!! I would not recommend this to anyone!Frustrated Mom"
5,They make it easy.,This is a nice little package for the money you will be HAPPY. It makes it so EASY to print.
4,Very good sampling of '60s hits,"Even though the title of the CD, ""#1 - Best of 60s Rock"", is not accurate (few of these songs every reached #1, but many were in Billboard's Top Ten), there's little not to like about this compilation of some of the best from '60s rock music. The only clunker on the disc is the anti-Vietnam War song, ""Sky Pilot"" by Eric Burdon & the Animals. The others, which include ""Summertime Blues"" by Blue Cheer (still the best version, IMHO), ""I Heard It Through the Grapevine"" by Marvin Gaye, ""Love Child"" by Diana Ross and the Supremes"", ""Ain't Nothing Like the Real Thing"" by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell, just to name 4 of the 12 cuts, are as memorable as they are recognizable. Good stuff!"
4,Great carry-along over- view guide for The Alps.,"Well laid out and presented. Gives a good general outline of the 4000m+ summits, the most popular routes taken to climb, and generally good descriptions of what to expect along the way, with cautions given to appropriate areas of the route, etc.Bound as a pocket book with vinyl cover, makes a great take-along guide to throw in your pack."
4,30 minutes.... just about right.,"Little Linda Blair really needed this video before she was possessed by, well, whatever it was that possessed her. Those were some Wild & Wacky guys that inhabited her poor soul, so I imagine that that is one of the areas covered by Mr. Henry's Wild & Wacky Bible Stories: All About Self Esteem.Only 30 minutes long, one might feel slighted by the amount of Wild & Wackiness that is covered by Mr. Henry. However, I'm guessing that 30 minutes will do as my professors always implored, ""like a great dress, cover the subject adequately, but remain short enough to keep it interesting.""Yes, 30 minutes of Wild & Wacky Bible Stories should just about do it. That Jesus guy probably takes up a good 20 minutes of tape time, 'cause let's face it, he's was the Wildest & Wackiest character of all."
2,Would love to review but.......,"Due to unforeseen supply difficulties, Amazon has delayed the delivery of this item by 3+ months... so they now expect to ship it to me sometime in May (I ordered it early February when it showed in Stock)...But... because the price was right, because it included free shipping and because I can live without a massage table for a few more months, I decided to wait it out...Reviews from people who got it ""while supplies lasted"" were rather positive compared to similar items, so hopefully I won't regret my choice!"
2,"Nice features, poor battery life.","Easy to use in the configurations shown. However, 3 million candlepower doesn't do you much good when the battery needs recharging after no more than 15 - 20 minutes of use."
3,Well written but long and rambling story,"The book overall is very well written, but the story is a bit long and rambles on. It definitely takes work to read this book. You must be prepared to pay attention. Not an easy read and mildly depressing."
2,All Hype And No Substance,"With all of the glowing reviews plastered all over the cover of the book I expectede much more. What I found was a book that pandered to all of the usual stereotypes that Americans have about Russians and Russian immigrants. There was not a single character that was not a cartoon of how you see Russians portrayed in every low budget, low plot, Hollywood movie. Vladimir, the protaginist is able to change his personality at will to accomodate any ridiculous situation that occurs and is never at a loss for what to do. I understand that in many books you have to suspend belief to a certain degree, but my credulity was stretched beyond all limits by this."
2,Overrated But Interesting,"This first novel has gotten a lot of hype - an article in the New York Times, a few scattered reviews here and there, comparing Mr. Schytegart to everybody from Salman Rushie, Saul Bellow to (egads!) Nabokov. For all that, I was disappointed in this novel. It's not as good as Nabokov! The main character, Girshkin is not that sympathetic, his female characters are thin and unconvincing, and his adventures are interesting but never really engaging. True, there are funny moments in the novel, but it's not the type of book that would force me to drop everything until I finished it. What I mean is, there are parts that are brillant, parts that are boring, and parts that are OK. So you see it's a mixed bag. I don't regret reading it, but I don't think I would have missed ""the next Nabokov"" if I hadn't, either. However, I look forward to seeing this author's future work."
3,If you have nothing better to do,"This is a nice light read if you have nothing better to do.The tone is sufficientlt sarcastic to attract people who have no idea of what is going on , and the milieu is exotic enough. As to the quality of the story the less said the better. Terrific for a slow reader on a longish air trip. Also guaranteed not to offend too much, even those who normaly would feel offended. You may call it humor if you like."
1,Penguin can forget it,Penguin set the price of the electronic edition higher than the paperback. I'm buying something else and there is plenty of something else from which to choose.
4,"Over the top, but",This is an excellent debut. I picked it up not knowing what to expect but his writing style made it a very compelling read. A little over the top but a very enjoyable read overall. Highly recommend.
5,EVERYTHING included,"I bought this kit after a friend lent me her Medela Pump In Stlye breast pump. Not knowing what I exactly needed, I bought this kit that included everything. In reality it would have been a lot cheaper to buy just the parts I needed separately (tubing, breast shields, valves, and bottles). This kit only comes with two bottles and I required 6. I could not find Medela bottles to buy separately, but I discovered that the Evenflo SimplyGo bottles attach to this assembly and they are very cheap. Overall, this kit is exactly what it says it is and it holds up to the high quality to be expected from Medela products."
1,"If you are thinking of this as a gift, Dont","I wont tell you how it ends, because I could not stomach the movie for more than 28 minutes.It looked to me like a poorly done high school production of ""hey kids, lets make a war movie"".When I read that there was no script, that all the lines were improve, it explained a lot.No plot, no direction, no character build, all in all a terrible waste of time and film.Please, Please, do not waste even a Netfilx space on the tripe."
4,Good soap but shipping is terrible,"I have ordered Charlie's All Purpose Cleaner once and liked it well enough to order again. I have now ordered twice in succession and it hasn't been delivered by UPS because the soap leaked in transit. This isn't good for me or the harried UPS guy who ended up with goo all over his truck at least one of the two times. So four stars for the product which is a reasonable eco-friendly cleaner, but be warned that the shipping isn't currently dependable."
5,Toxic-Free cleaning that almost makes you want to clean!!,"The title says it all. You (probably*) won't grow a 3rd arm from cleaning with this and spraying on your clothing.The truth is, it works like a charm, lasts forever and it's cheap. (And, it's natural.) Bonus.*Who knows about the 3rd arm thing. Soon, air is going to be carcinogenic."
2,Not as Good as the Original,"I used to detest gospel music because it sounded so dry and every song always sounded the same. But, when a friend of mine left a copy of the first CD in my car radio it was the turning point of my life. I started my car and this guy says ""everybody with the drop tops and everybody in the phat trucks..."" I was like WOW! but he wasnt on either of these last two albums and frankly I am very disappointed. To me in order to get young people back gospel has to exhibit that saved people have greater offerings in all music formats (gospel style). Does anyone know if this guy has a solo album out? The radio voice calls him Mr. Cass but the album has no name but Percy Gray and I know that aint him?"
3,stretching poster,"The concept is good. And putting it on a poster is good, but the pictures are small. So if you are sitting on the floor trying to look up at the poster, good luck.I'm going to dry mount it to a hard or Styrofoam board so I can stand it up and place it on the floor near me."
4,Essential for Western tourists.,"In general, Fodor's guidebooks are the best on the market because of their accuracy and wit. Fodor's Japan is particularly useful, especially for those who are unfamiliar with the Land of the Rising Sun. The guide describes in detail the whole country -- from the bustling and chaotic streets of Tokyo to the pristine arctic beauty of Hokkaido Island. In addition, the guide is packed with general tips on customs, culture, history and language. If you're traveling to Japan, it is a must-have."
2,Sincerely not my favorite. Cumbersome,"The only thing I am not crazy about with the Mac is the lack of clip art or royalty free pictures. So, I got Photo Objects.While some are actually quite nice, the bulk of the photos are really not up to snuff. Pictures of cheesy statues, etc.My biggest problem is it will not install correctly and keeps freezing up.Get an on-line service if you really need the clip art."
5,Outsyanding Service,The seller was able to provide a rare book I was seeking. Quickly and without any drama. They
4,Super easy to use Mic,I have a digital home studio where I use a M-Audio Project Mix I/O with Protools 8 but I don't always feel like setting up my entire rig to record quick demos when they are fresh in my head. Enter MXL's Cardioid Condenser USB Mic. This mic simply plugs into the USB port on my Mac Pro and is instantly available for use in Garage Band or any other DAW that doesn't require specific hardware (i.e. Protools).My only complaint is that the input volume cannot be controlled via software. There is a switch on the mic itself for Low/Medium/High performance which works fine but I'd rather have complete control.Overall it's great for quick projects and demos.
2,"Great player, but not great teacher","The problem with these teaching videos is the same: a great musician who records his chops so you can see how awesome he is, without teaching you a thing. If you understand the concepts he is talking about, then that means you have already attained ""the truth"" in jazz and you didn't need to watch this video in the first place. It's more like George is having inside jokes with the guitar players who ""get it"", and those of us who ""still don't get it"" are left confused and frustrated.I put down my guitar ten minutes into the video because it was futile. I couldn't even hear myself play after seeing how George BREEZES through the neck whipping out one tasty jazz lick after another.Don't kid yourself: it takes a lot of theoretical knowledge and long hours of practice before you can play like George. This video is nice to watch once or twice, but it won't help you."
3,Love Benson but...,"As much as I love George Benson, one of the best jazz guitarists of all time, this DVD has very little to offer jazz players at any level. He is basically doodling and someone else transcribed partially what he was playing. I was lucky enough to have a real lesson with George many years ago and didn't come away with much then either. Some weren't meant to teach. Pat Martino, who said he hated teaching, gave me a private lesson around the same time and I still discover new things from that day. Go figure."
1,LONG DELAY IN DELIVERY,I HAVE NOT YET RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT. PLSE INVESTIGATE AND REVERT. I WILL BE OUT OF DUBAI FROM JUL 10TH TO JUL 23RD INCLUSIVE SO IF IT IS DELIVERED THEN I WILL BE AWAY.KEN WILSON
5,Broan bath fan.,Fan is quiet great at keeping steam out and light is a nice added bonus. This unit replaced an unlit unit (also a Broan).
3,Chear plastic blades,"We could not believe it was the right fan when we opened up the box. The fan itself was brown, the blades were cheap plastic beige ones. The fan looks modern, single colored in the pictures, but in reality the cheap plastic bladed are sticking out. I even called the seller to express my disbelief that the right blades were sent. Turns out minka sells decent blades (matching wood color) separately for $35 dollars extra. Real disappointed in the representation of the product."
1,Run screaming from Pinnacle,"I cannot believe that they are still in business under the same name. I have owned several versions of Studio, starting with the one that ccame with my 1.6G Compaq. Not one of them has ever worked as claimed. Like another reviewer implied, if you buy a program from them, spend an equal or greater amount on Valium. You might get something, but it won't be without pain and suffering. I have been through the service maze - it is beyond useless - it is a trap. A typical reply takes three weeks and consists of a shrug and suggestion you upgrade to the newest version. Of course, that works the same or worse than the one you have.If this company built roads, I wouldn't drive on them."
1,I had to add to the millions of bad reviews,I have spent hours and hours away from my family trying to make DVDs of edited home movies. I have only been able to burn cd's and not dvd's. Rendering takes forever! Don't waste your time on this program. The live service on line is even worse than the program itself. If this is what video editing is about - I will go back to photos.
2,Do not buy Studio 9 Software! It is no longer supported,"This software is no longer supported by Pinnacle. I have this software and tried to install on a PC to make a DVD for a friend from his old VHS tape. It was frustrating trying to locate drivers for Pinnacle capture card. Pinnacle no longer has them posted on their site. When I finally get the drivers & software working, I am able to capture video without problems. The kicker comes when I am ready to burn a DVD. I forgot Pinnacle requires you to unlock the MPEG code before making a DVD. Unfortunately the website for obtaining the key no longer exists.So save your money to buy another product or at least get one of Pinnacle's currently supported products."
1,How can they sell this pile of crap?,"This is the most buggy software I have ever used. It has three main modes, capture, edit and make movie. I have experienced freezes and crashes in all three modes. Whats's strange is that sometimes (rarely) the product will work. I previosly used studio 7 and it ran without a hitch. I upgraded because I wanted to author DVD's from home video. I don't understand how they can sell this thing. I'm looking for something else."
1,"YIKES!! Run, do not walk, to the nearest EXIT!!","TERRIBLE! This software is so full of quirks. After I worked HOURS through about a hundred ""bugs"", went through (wasted) a dozen cd's and dvd's, I finally produced a somewhat acceptable video, only to find that I CANNOT GET IT TRANSFERRED TO A DVD!! First the picture comes through, but no audio, then no picture on parts and no audio. Three calls to so-called ""tech-support"" yielded three different solutions, none of which has worked. AAAAARGGGGGHH!! Save your money! Unless you don't mind the mind-numbing frustration!"

2,Pinnacle is notorious for crashing.,"I've worked with various Pinnacle Studio versions since last decade, and they've all had two things in common:1. When the program works, it's superb.2. The other 50% of the time, it crashes frequently, and hard!For years, Pinnacle had designed the market's top, novice-affordable video editing/authoring platforms, but for some frustrating reason, they just can't seem to keep the bugs out. This verson is no exception.Lately, the competition in this market has mushroomed, and there are better alternatives available for the same price. At last, others have emulated the Pinnacle platform while eliminating the work/creativity-killing bugs.My advice? Shop around. Google the competition. But save yourself the frustration and steer away from anything Pinnacle."
2,The cover is really the best thing about the book,A cute kid's book and brief history of Halloween around the world(though I do wonder about the historical accuracy hmmm...). It was also weird that this was a male-only space the whole time. Easy to read and I'm sure any kid who loves Halloween would love this book. It just did nothing for me as an adult.
5,Mind blowing...,"The book is very readable, and goes into depth about the principles that it was written to cover. As a chemist, I bought this book to learn about calculus of variations for a stat-thermo course as well as understand the reasoning behind the Hamiltonian. It does lack problems, save for asking the reader to clear up some trivial details. If you want a book loaded with exercises and cookbook recipes for solving problems, look elsewhere. If you want to feel like you're sitting through the best physics lecture of your life, get this book."
5,Great Book to have for your Library!,"This is an excellent book for you rubber stampers that are ready to use your rubber stamps for more than just greeting cards. It is full of beautiful and fun projects, with detailed and easy to follow instructions as well as lots and lots of beautiful color pictures. A great book to give as a gift or buy for your self, you won't be disappointed!"
1,not really cappuccino,"had the Cafe Roma for about 4 months....dumped it on ebay. Why?...tastes like coffee, not cappuccino. The machine looks nice but its all about the taste."
3,Initial Use,"This review is FIRST USE ONLY, after few uses, I'll post new review if necessary.I just replaced my burned up Nuova Simonelli Oscar Pro.Makes VERY good espresso, nice rich, I like it!Froths real good and creammy, but takes time to heat up the milk.You set the included cups on the drip tray, start the machine, and they vibrate out of place, losing some espresso if you're not paying attention.The biggest challenge w/this machine is the filter & basket.Replacing filter basket, is a real &^%$#. The docs say they improved the basket w/the permanent spring to hold the filter. Well, that's a sorry excuse for a spring. Falls in my used grind bucket every time. It's too hot to hadnle, I'll have to pick it up quickly and 'drop' it back on before I burn myself.Overall, I'm happy w/this, so far. We'll see how it acts after a few cups."
2,Not what we expected,"I spent a lot of time reviewing various espresso machines and finally decided on the Breville. My husband uses his machine everyday so we wanted something that was more metal than plastic and that could brew a good hot cup. Unfortunately, the espresso turned out runny and not very hot. We tried several different grinds with no improvement. We are going back to our original Krups model--it's cheap looking, but it works well."
5,Saves $$,"Great dependable little machine. My wife spent a lot of money on lattes before someone gave us this little guy. We've had it several years with no problems whatsoever. It doesn't make as strong of a shot as a professional machine, but it does make a nice crema. The milk steamer works wonderfully.You can't use a really fine grind. I've also had the pores clog one in 3-4 years - it took about 10 minutes using the included cleaning pin to clear them."
2,Was great for a little while,"Made great coffee for about 25 cups, using distilled water since I hoped to get around the problems people reported. I have done everything to clean the pod and it is time intensive. I can get coffee out but now it is cold coffee. Save your money and go for an expensive espresso maker."
5,The kitchen crown jewel,"I researched many machines, and used a Francis Francis! daily at work before I purchased this Breville on sale at Macy's. It is MAJORLY easier to use than the pretty but ergonomically painful $600 Francis. The ""B"" froths richer foam in half the time, takes less time to heat up, and produces beautiful crema.Cons: I sometimes use PODS, and the machine does not come with a double pod shot accessorie- though the cups, saucers and frothing cup are a beautiful set.I tell everyone about my new gift card purchase, because there's nothing else out there of this quality, of this affordability. and of this sleek beauty."
1,Be Careful,"I bought this machine to replace my DeLongi 20 year old one. What an experience... The second time I tried to use it, the coffee holder got plugged up. I contacted Breville. They suggested I go through several processes to get it upplugged. I did.. Wasted over an hour trying to no avail.I contacted them again. They promised to ship me a new holder within two days. I waited 3 weeks and never got it. I contacted them two more times before they finally shipped me one.Now they want me to run clear water thru it after everytime I use it.Needless to say, it is way overprices and does not work..."
1,Disappointing!,"These are the episodes;The umbrella (in ""Visitor and other stories"")The seaside ( in ""Visitor and other stories"")The rainbow puddle (in ""Pig's present and other stories"")The paddling pool( in ""Snowy day and other stories)Big owl's bathMy son is a Kipper's big fan and has almost all VHSs. If you have other tapes above, the last one episode would be new. And this tape has a bothering caption at the bottom of the screen all the time saying, ""for screening purpose only! exclusive oroperty of HIT."" Stories themselves are good."
4,"Good, clean fun","I have to say that I enjoy all the Kipper videos and this one is no exception. I have a 3 year old daughter who delights in watching Kipper and Tiger's antics in this particular DVD.One great thing about Kipper videos is that they aren't full of violence and instead are low-key and show Kipper working out problems or learning new things. That is a rare find in the selection of ""children's"" videos."
5,Wonderful introduction to the life of Muhammad,"This is a beautiful, brief biography of the life of Muhammad. Demi's illustrations are lovely and are a perfect complement to his life. Of course it does not cover every aspect of Muhammad's life, but it is respectful and Demi's selection of episodes in his life are accurate and not misleading at all. I highly recommend this book as an introduction to Muhammad and Islam."
4,"Beautiful art work, story a little slow","This is a nice account of the life of the Prophet, but the story telling drags a bit. As always Demi's artwork is beautiful. Were I to grade the story telling alone, I would probably give it 3.5 stars. Then I would give the presentation (artwork, printing, etc. 5 stars). The story is definitely not for children any younger than seven. My six year old is an advanced and avid reader, but she becomes bored with this story rather quickly. This is telling given that she can sit down with something like ""Charlotte's Webb"" for more than an hour. Nonetheless, for the time being this is the best biography of the Prophet in English for young readers. Hopefully there will be something to surpass this for both a younger audience (4 to 8) and an young adult audience. It is amazing that there are not many quality children's books about the person considered by some to have been the most influential individual in history."
3,Quality matched the Low Price as expected,Ordered as a costume jewelry piece. The quality matches the low price. The picture looks better than the actual product.The size is marked 10 but measures only 8.5. I ordered it big so I just wear it on a different finger.I like it for the price I paid.
2,Nothing Unifying Here,I bought this book with the hope of reading how top contemporary Protestant scholars address the issue of ecclesiology espoused by Rome and the Orthodox. It left me sadly disappointed. The chapter that addresses the four marks of the church defined in the nicene creed did not attempt to reconcile Protestant perceptions of those terms with the historical understanding of the council fathers. None dealt substantially with Eph 5:32. I was further saddened that one author criticized the piety of Catholics on the basis of his understanding rather than taking the time to just ask some of them why they were doing it. All guns trained against Catholicism while the Eastern Orthodox hold nearly identical views on ecclesiology. Perhaps someday a book with less rhetoric and polemic will attempt to address issues that build understanding rather than polarizing divisiveness.
3,OK but nothing special,"Armor All Extreme shine and some others do just as good a job for less money. Black Magic,303, Eagle one."
1,Thumbs down,"My own personal opinion is this is not a well-written handbook. As many of us people know, this book shows the end of the world is nearing. With content that is passes as Sci-Fi. The pictures that consume about 1/2 of this lengthy handbook. It is no wonder that there is such little text. Ther are much better books out there for those of you who would like to get some level of satisfaction out of a good read. But this one, definely is not. In the way Gene Siskel woudl say, ""Thumbs down"""
3,Unexpectedly large,"This watch is quite large for a women's model. The height of the actual watch plus a rather thick, stiff strap combine to make a watch that will not fit a thin wrist, leaving large gaps on both sides."
1,Again it will not work,This is the second game I've purchased through amazon that will not work. Don;t you check your products. I am getting very annoyed with this company.
1,Pray it does not break,"I had this phone for a month, quality was ok, but reception not the best. After 28 days, my phone started acting up. I called samsung, mailed it to them and did not get it back until 2 months later! I did have to continue paying my cell service, over $140.00 for the 2 months. Samsung said it would take 3-4 weeks, but they had to wait for a part? The manufacture had to wait for a part! I would be on hold, get transferred, etc. to find out their database is only updated about once a month with the repair status. Customer service and Warranty deserve a great big 0. This phone is not worth the extra's you'll probably never use any way."
5,this music will change your life,"dashboard confessional is one of the most ingenious bands of music. they have started a phaze that will not be forgotten. their music has created a ring of amazing beauty in the joy that can be had of music. dasboard is a must for any music collection. they are mellow but powerful, and enchanting in the least!"
5,"Praise for ""PrayerWalk""","Inspiring and frank; you don't have to be a very religious person to benefit from the suggestions and allusions to ""The Personal Trainer"". Well written, folksey and appealing. Pratical help from this wife-mother-teacher-friend; ""Prayerwalk"" will be a perfect companion for a religious study group and/or just for moments of inspiration."
2,Adapter hardly worth it,"I was disappointed when I finally received a product that would allow me to use earpieces not designed for the Samsung SGH-s105 phone. When it is plugged in, interference can be heard from both parties. However, it is even louder on the recieving end of the phone call than from the person making the call.The only saving grace of this product is it's price and that's not saying much since I had to buy 2 in order to justify the shipping costs."
4,"Doing the job, but made in China","I should have known if the price is too good and it has the word ""American"" on the label, it will be made in China.Aside from that, so far so good. The digital timer could be easier to use. I'm not sure what other product they pulled it from, but I've used much simpler designs.Two words of caution-1. wash the solor panel with water to clean the dust off. 2. mount the motor with large washers and bolts, one big racoon could pull those screws right out."
4,Hard Core Pop,"The album is good sample of Smyth's talent. She has a sound that is unique with her raspy-like voice. It is a sound that fits all styles. There are hard core, rough lyrics such as ""My Town"" and there are the sensitive soft poems such as ""I Should be Laughing"". If you liked Scandal's sound then this album is for you. If you like her voice then any of her albums are for you."
4,Andy's final season,"This is the ending to a great run on TV. America grew up enjoying the cast as they entertained us with their lives in a small town. The season leads us toward the sequal, Mayberry RFD, while still giving us viewing enjoyment. Overall, a happy ending."
3,The End .. and a New Beginning,"Season eight continues the trend of season seven by improving on what are now known as the ""Color Episodes"". Its the character of Howard Sprague that makes a lot of these episodes entertaining (""Howard and Millie"" almost makes you forget you are watching a color episode). ""Howard's New Life"" is unbelievable and mostly wierd, but it has its funny moments when Howard first moves in and sizes up his new home. ""Barney Hosts a Summitt Meeting"" is also unbelievable, but it turns out to be the best of his ""return shows"" since leaving the series. At the end their are four transistion shows with Ken Berry being established as farmer Sam Jones for the new series ""Mayberry RFD"". The incredibly talented performer is miscast in a lame attempt at continuing the adventures of Mayberry, and ends up being dull and uninteresting. Surprisingly, the show was successful and ran for three years before CBS decided to axe all its rural themed shows. Recommended for completists only."
5,ANDY GRIFFITH THE FINAL SEASON,"SUCH A SHAME THIS HAD TO BE THE END OF THE SEASONS OF ANDY GRIFFITH, THIS IS ONE OF MY MOST FAVORITE SHOWS AND AT LEAST I OWN THE WHOLE COLLECTION SO I CAN SIT BACK AND WATCH ALL THE GREAT COMEDY FROM MAYBERRY."
2,A tired show by this season.,"As this is my all time favorite television show, it's hard to admit that this season was running on fumes. The best characters were dead or had moved on. Andy seemed like he was in a mad mood most of the time, and Don Knotts was gone. Ken Berry being brought in at the last to be set up for Mayberry R.F.D. was not a good idea. I will probably buy this so my set will be complete, but it's kind of sad to watch."
3,Not Just Christian Quotes,"I ordered this book thinking it would have a sundry of quotes from various famous Christians. It quotes all kinds of people, not just Christians. This book is a mixture of wheat and chaff. Quotations come from Margaret Mead, Benjamin Franklin, French, Swedish and Spanish proverbs, various unbelieving philosophers and Ralph Waldo Emerson (who claimed that Jesus was a good man, but not God)--to name a few. I paid too much for this book. It doesn't deliver what I had hoped."
4,Joyful Toiles,"I purchased this book for my mother, who is a textile fanatic and bonafide lover of toiles de jouy. This book offers 50 plates of French toile fabric and wallpaper designs. I love toile as well, so I, quite naturally, flipped through the book before giving it to my mom. It was wonderful to look at the historical patterns. I would have been a little happier if more information would have been provided about each pattern. For instance, I would have liked to have known more about who created each pattern, any famous personage who purchased the pattern featured, where I might find more historic samples of toile.It's a lovely gift and well worth the money, though. I recommend it with four stars."
4,Great Jacket! Especially for the price.,"Because of the price, I was a little worried about the quality, but was pleasantly surprised when my jacket arrived. The leather seems thick & sturdy, and all of the zippers appear to be of good quality. I have had this jacket for about a month now & can honestly say that it is the warmest leather jacket I've worn while riding so far! I'm sure there are better jackets out there, but not in my budget. I am thrilled with this jacket & think it will see many years of service while I ride my bike!"
3,scratched all over,"they didnt mention in the summary that this item was scratched all over the back. it does play though, so i really cant complain"
4,Not a horror film - so don't write your review as if it is.,"I just want to say that I enjoyed this comedy.That's right... it's a comedy. Not a horror movie. It's not supposed to be. It's supposed to be a mockery of ""Dawn of the Dead.""So, for those of you who watched it and reviewed it based on your hopes of it being a pee-your-pants horor flick, you were very mistaken because that isn't what it is or what it was intended to be.I like all movies, and I also love the movie ""Dawn of the Dead,"" and this movie was a very funny counterpart."
5,Love this movie,"I really enjoyed this movie, its mix of comedy and horror really worked well together and it even managed to throw some romance into the mix. I really enjoy Simon Pegg and Nick Frost's acting in this movie and most of their other movies for that matter. It is a strong zombie movie and a strong comedy. I definitely recommend this movie to others."
4,Great Movie,"This is a great comedy. If you have never watched British comedies, let this be your introduction. Again, great movie."
4,A Great Zombie Flick!,"If zombies are your bag, and you're looking for a good laugh at the same time, then this flick is for you.The movie follows the standard zombie plot. Hero gets up one day, does his usual thing, and suddenly everyone is a zombie and it is up to him to save the planet. Only here, the catch is that Shaun is just your average everyday slacker in a dead-end job. He doesn't have a chiseled figure and is filled with self doubts. His best friend is disliked by many and is a slacker himself. In other words, these aren't the guys you would expect to be leading a group of people to safety.But this movie works. Unlike other movies which focus on blood and gore, this movie focuses on humour. The gore and violence is kept to minimum, with more of a focus spent on the interactions between Shaun, his girlfriend, and his slacker buddy.This is most definitely a zombie movie for the Gen-X'ers amongst us."
4,Great Friday Night Movie,"Movie arrived in two days, thank to prime membership. I've always been a Simon Pegg fan since his show Spaced. I think this is a great movie with great humor and great lines."
2,Ummm...this movie is way to overrated...,"Ok first let me say I love Zombie/horror/gore movies, I just freaking love them.So when I heard they where making a comedy about zombie movies I was like this is going to be great, and then the reviews started coming in and it sounded really good, the hype was high...so what happened? Did they all see a different movie then I did? Cause the movie I saw was your typical zombie movie with a TINY bit (and I mean tiny bit) of humor in it. That's it, nothing new, nothing original, nothing great. Below average at best.I've seen the good zombie comedies, Dead Alive, Evil Dead 2, Army of Darkness...this one falls short of all of them by miles.Where's the humor...I mean every now and then we have a scene that should be funny...but the humor never comes out, I don't understand it? Why are there so many good reviews for this bad movie?Unless you are starved for a zombie flick don't pick this one up, don't make the same mistake I did."
1,had to tell the truth,me and several friends watched this movie and we all felt the same way about it !!it was so bad that i threw it in the trash i should have burned iti have never seen any thing so stupid and boring in my life.i gave this a one star and that is over doing it by far
2,"OK, but overrated....","I have to admit I was rather disappointed in this film. It was occasionally funny, but never rip roaring hilarious like many said it was. Ironically, Romero's Dawn of the Dead (and Raimi's Evil Dead series) had a lot of dark humour in them already, and they're a lot funnier than Shaun is. This film tries way too hard to be funny, and you feel like you almost have to laugh. Sure, there are some chuckles, but the only time I really laughed out loud was when Shaun put on a red bandana, and looked exactly like Christopher Walken from The Deer Hunter. It had to be intentional. It was very funny, but the rest of it was sloppy and not the drop dead (excuse the pun) hilarious film that critics and fans made it out to be."
4,A Classic Tribute to a Classic Horror Film,"I thought this movie was extremely funny and a great tribute to the original Romero ""undead"" movies. The actors were hilarious. I especially liked that the premise was not copied from Romero's films (with the exception of the resurrection of the dead.) It was a love story that just happened to be during a zombie plague. The character, Ed, was so laid back. To him, it was as if the zombie phenomena happened every day. I liked the ""what happened when..."" during the plot holes part of the DVD. This is a great movie to have a scary laugh."
4,Loved this spoof!,"I entirely enjoyed this spoof of the horror classics. I laughed and laughed at the antics of Shaun and his pals. Nothing is believable, but that's what makes it funny. It's so ludicrious it's hilarious!"
4,What a wild ride!,"This was a crazy, funny movie. I loved the subtle humor and the gory zombie scenes made for an edge-of-my-seat experience. The movie was cleverly written and enjoyable."
3,STANDARD ZOMBIE FARE PLAYED FOR LAUGHS,"Shaun is already living the life of a zombie. As he wonders aimlessly through his dead-end life the viewer observes hints here and there of the coming apocalypse. Shaun is oblivious.This movie was not as funny as I thought it was going to be. The best bits are pieced together in the trailer.Pretty standard zombie fare, with stabs at the genre here and there. Wait for the DVD."
1,shaun of the dead,"i thought this movie was going to be better than i expected. but when i watched it, i couldnt really understand half the jokes, they were either talking too fast or too quiet, and the zombie parts were disturbing and unnecessary in this movie. overall, if you like movies that are laugh out loud crazy over the top comedies with violence with tradgedy and drama and romance all squeezed into 1 hour 40 minutes, then this is the movie for you."
4,Laughs and A Bit of Fright!,I love this film! It is wry British humor and that is something to keep in mind. I surely wouldn't say it's as good as Monty Python but if you enjoy them you will enjoy this. It is a quality comedy and horror.Excellent. My friends and I quote it regularly!
3,Monster Kingdom: Jewel Summoner Review,"This game isn't bad if you're me. If you are the type of person who likes seemingly endless dialogues between characters, than you won't have a problem here. If you happen to have played any of the Shin Megami Tensei games and thought that they were pretty cool, then you won't have a problem liking this game. If you happen to be into Pokemon, then you won't have a problem with this game. The story may be a bit dry at times, but there isn't a point in which you feel the need to either rush through the story segments or simply turn off your PSP. The combat system is descent, very much like Pokemon. It is turned based and there are random battles. I haven't beaten the game, so I still have yet to see where the story is going to take me and whether the ending is disappointing or not. This may or may not be a useful review, but take it that I have yet to find anything truly wrong with this interesting game."
3,Ok but,Didn't come for a extra week and had to go down to the post office and get pay for more postage for the comicI bought this for a birthday gift It really doesn't help paying more
3,DARIUS HOO?,"To the person who wrote about Darius Rucker from Hootie And the Blowfish: You're an idiot and you apparantly don't have a clue and know absolutely nothing about music. Aside from that, this a decent second time around for BBD, of course it's not as ground- breaking as Poison, but if you like their style, you'll dig this. Expect to hear a couple of good ballads by Ricky, one written and produced, and even background sung by Babyface."
2,average,just like Poison this disc has a few ok songs but pretty much forgettable.SOmething in your eyes is the cut but overall this is very average.catchy at the time but nothing worth getting.wait for New Edition.
5,Good replacement,"I accidentally ordered this instead of an actual Motorola branded battery. I think the ""Motorola"" tag threw me off.I especially avoided the batteries that cost less than $15 as the reviews are all over the map regarding reliability. However, I decided to give this one a try. So far, it has worked flawlessly and the charge lasts for days. It's like having a new cell phone again!"
3,battery replecement,"The original battery I ordered was useless. However, the company did send me a replacement that is marginally better."
5,Come to the Light Side,"Amazing book, with Jedi way in all forms. For your Star Wars campaign, here we have prestige classes, Light Side force skills, and a entire chapter about Jedi history, Jedi traditions...this is the best, in my opinion. With this, you can show and teach to the players what really means to be a Jedi. Its is not about rolling dices and kill enemies. It's better than that.I recommend this book, it is a good investment."
5,Simple and fabulous,"I bought this kit to make and give as a gift for our good friends. It couldn't have been easier or more perfect. Yes, the traditional Monopoly rules of play are simplified a little bit, but that's a bonus; the traditional Monopoly game takes too long to play while this version does not take as long. It's way more fun, though! I customized everything to our friends' lives, and it was a gigantic hit. You do need to plan about six hours of dedicated time to put this all together, but it is well worth it. Also, instead of using the enclosed regular paper to print the money, I used my own card stock, knowing that Monopoly money wears out fast from repeated play. The bottom line is that this really is simple to use, and I am nearly computer illiterate. I am so impressed by this game. I know I'll buy it again and again to make for other friends, as well."
1,Not for Dog that love to Chew,"I purchased this toy with hopes that my dogs would love to play with it. Maybe we could toss it around and catch it. I later found out it is not a toy to leave with the ""chewing"" dog. My 100 pound lab/pit bull mix tore off pieces of it. I retrieved the pieces and the frisbee to sit it aside. It is not a toy that can be left around for those dogs with an urge to chew! It might work for one who likes to play frisbee."
4,Excellent summation of Vedanta,"Overall, an excellent historical summation of Vedanta. Torwesten attempts to synthesize the various philosophies of Vedanta (especially Bhakta and Jnana yogas), and to reconcile the austere and intellectually dry views of Adi Shankaracharya with the broader views of Sri Ramakrishna and other Vedantic sages with similar or more ""liberal"" viewpoints, and does a pretty fair job of it."
4,great product,"i am a former mac user and this is my first mac in 10 years. I go back to System 7 with my history with Mac. I was afraid the feel would be too close to the linux interfaces which even today, with all the effort put into them have an amateurish feel to them (out of the box, of course). I found the menu bar up top a welcomed surprise. The unit was very simple to upgrade with a $3 putty knife and 2GB of ram for $75 after rebate.I use vmware to keep 2 corporate VPN's up at the same time. It has made my home office more productive, with a feeling of nostalgia."
2,Stevie deserves better,"I suppose it is my own fault if I disagree with the material selection...it is a highly subjective matter. Personally I think there is too much of the earliest stuff on it that was made before he hit his mature genius. However, it is inexcusable that the recording quality is so dreadful! There are remastered versions of this material available that sound wonderful, and much of this sounds like a transistor radio. Another rip-off by a record label on us. One wonders if the engineers who put this stuff together have any pride at all in their work. I see no evidence of it here!"
5,i love stevie wonder,"omg, i am a big Stevie Wonder fan, i grew up with his music, i think this cd is the best one, it has a little bit of all his music, from when he first started, to recent music.."
1,Yet Another Casualty of World War I,"Having just seen OH, WHAT A LOVELY WAR, I realize now that the director who so arrogantly decided to mangle A CHORUS LINE had already had experience in turning a unique theatrical success into a turgid overblown film. Richard Attenborough can be added to a select list of talented film directors (including John Huston and Francis Ford Coppola) who should never have been entrusted with the filming of successful musicals. [Who could have guessed that Josh Logan would prove equally inept?] On the other hand, if you enjoyed the film versions of FINIAN'S RAINBOW, PAINT YOUR WAGON or CAMELOT, you might like this one. I found it a pretentious, crashing bore and a criminal waste of talent."
1,"Ruined, great pity.","A brilliant film, totally wrecked by being out of sync to a degree that made it almost impossible to watch."
5,Homeplug ethernet bridge,"Item shipped quickly and arrived well packed. Extremely easy to set up and use. Good software & instructions. Robust & speedy network, far faster than my WAN. Has worked on every outlet I've tried so far in my 100 year old house, even through an extension cord."
2,DVDs arrived scratched,"Having read numerous reviews commenting about the packaging, I was preparedfor that. I didn't like the packaging either,so I ordered a DVD case and transferredthe DVDs to it. But as I transferred them, I noticed several scratches already onthe discs. I am disappointed with the discs, not the shows."
1,Very Poor Quality,Ordered this collection of DVDs even though some people had rated it poorly. The very first disc skipped parts of the program. The collection was returned for a refund. Do not waste your money on this collection.
1,Bad Discs - 2 Times Now,I really want to purchase and KEEP this seried But... The first set I got would freeze up in various places and I was unable to play a whole disc all the way through without that problem.Sent for an exchange and the second set is doing the same thing. I tried them in more than 1 player with the same result.Wish I could get a set that doesn't do that...wondering if these are done on poor quality discs?If there is a set that is is good condition I'd get it!PS: These are supposed to be NEW discs.
3,Problem,Great item but season 1 disk 3 has a problem. I couldn't watch a couple of the shows. I'm not sure if it's just the copy I received or if they are all like that. It acts like it is scratched or something but looking at it you can't see anything. I hope everybody else gets a better copy. As much as this set is you would expect better quality.
4,The Andy Griffith Show - The Complete Series,Has all the episodes but not the pilot - minor disappointment but then it never said the pilot was included.
1,Thank God for the people,"Thank God for customer reviews-they have saved me mistakes/Money by tipping me off to a waste of my time and money! They have had the Andy Griffith complete set on ""the deal of the day"" a couple of times that I have seen and I would click ""buy"" in an instant as the set is what I want but I'm not going to bother if the epeisodes are edited and ther are no good extras which is the feature that seals the deal on buying the complete sets of series in the first place!!! Come on give the people what they want! A decent COMPLETE, UNEDITED,WELL PACKAGED Andy Griffith Box Set!!!!They go to all the trouble and expense of makeing ones available for sale and they are incomplete and not worth it-why bother than-Come On! If you're going to do it (AND YOU SHOULD)do it right!!!!!"
5,Awesome Complete Series!,What a great complete series. I had a dvd here and there and now I have the entire series. Nice compact and complete packaging. I love it.
5,This is one of my favorite shows!,"I bought this set about 3 years ago. It includes the pilot episode from Make Room for Daddy, the ""Opie Joins the Marines"" episode from Gomer Pyle U.S.M.C and the Return to Mayberry Movie.I like the packaging very much. I don't know why alot of people don't. The discs stay in the holder just fine. I like how each season folds out. I also like the design and art work. This set does not include descriptions of each episode like the individual seasons have. I just got the descriptions from online so I can look at them when I watch an episode. The Andy Griffith Show - The Complete Series is a great collection. This is a wonderful family show. I highly recommend. SHOW 5 stars - - - PACKAGING 5 stars - NO complaints about the packaging."
3,Inventory Confusion,"The comforter thickness is good, the pillows are cute. The fabric is so-so. Given these attributes, $30 plus free shipping is a decent deal, not the retail $340.The bad thing is I ordered a Beige and received Gold. The item has no mark to indicate what color it is. But comparing the pictures (Gold and Beige) to the item I received, it's definitely not Beige and I asked several people's opinion.I've contact customer service. This will test Amazon's service on a discounted item."
2,More than a little predictable...,Again this is one of those novels that I couldn't wait to read. I was hoping it would give me a happy large woman to cheer for...but instead it gave me a sullen whiner who seemed to snip at everyone. I couldn't rally behind her. I didn't really like her. The story line was actually pretty cool. Almost like The Biggest Loser meets Surreal Life meets Survivor...but it fell apart and ended up becoming unbelievable as the girl everyone loves to hate ends up being with the smarmy host who we're supposed to believe is a really nice guy...it becomes a sickeningly sweet over the top unbelievable romance instead of something real with heart and humor. Sorry this one just isn't worth your time.
3,It's OK. Looking fwd to more,I enjoyed this book. There were some parts that dragged and I actually fell in love with some of the other characters rather than the main character Kat. But overall good writing and I'm interested to read more by this author to see if the next one will engage me more. But loved the reality of the battle of the bulge. It wasn't extreme and she had fun doing it and you'll have a lot of fun reading about it.
2,It is what it is.,Nothing fancy here it does what it is designed for. The one I received is missing a screw which supports the main connection. That is pretty poor quality control for just a box with a few parts.
3,much ado,"this was an attempt to milk the cream popularity, much like air force and blind faith, and cream live over and over again talented studio artists not withstanding these albums were created to meet musician contractual requirements i preferjack in wbl"
4,frank and well written,"A smart American journalist spends some years in Turkey and speaks frankly about what he saw and felt. The result is an interesting, readable and informative book with some imperfections: The tone is often too prescriptive and many assertions are questionable. This is not serious scholarship. Rather, it is more like having a long conversation with an informed Turkophile. That's why I liked it."
3,Know what you are looking for...,This book is for someone who has no or a bit knowledge on Turkey and does not want to go far in terms of history or politics of the country. Book is easy to read as it covers daily life with some shallow history and politics. I dont think that author has done a bad job after all. But it is not enough to understand a culture and its people by staying with them 4 years it's more than that.
3,Repetitive,"I found this book to be extremely repetitive. Kinzer takes a look at the same problem in Turkish society (lack of democratization) through multiple lenses (that army, the Kurdish question, torture, etc). However, he always has the same basic conclusion. It made reading the book rather boring after a while. Other than that the book was enegaging and good start for a quick look at modern Turkey and its problems."
5,"Cute, cute, and cute!!","I loved the book Piggie Pie!!! Whenever I am at the library at school and I can't find a book, I check out Piggie Pie! An old witch wakes up and wants to eat Piggie Pie. She's got every ingrediant but......THE PIGS!!!This book is so great. I recommend this book to any one who loves picture books!!"
1,Horrible book,I look through all my children's books quickly before reading it and it was horrible!First this witch wants to kill pigs for her piggie pie....she insults everyone who tells her there is no pigs (well it is pigs in disguise) and then when she gives up she runs into a wolf. They talk and she is like why don't you come over to my house for dinner and that last page shows that they are thinking to eat each other! A wolf head on a sandwich and witch head on a bun.Never ever buy this book or read it to my children.
5,Piggie Pie!,"Piggie Pie, is not only fun for kids, but the kid still alive in all of us. I recently took several of my 19 year old's favorite childhood books on vacation to read to my girlfriends son. I knew Piggie Pie would be a favorite, and Man! Did I read that book over and over! It was so much fun!"
5,Great Kids Book,This is one of my favorite children's book and I love to give it as a gift.As a Kindergarten teacher it is my pick!
3,"Good writing, fascinating premise, but execution is lacking","Who better than Michael Chabon to pay homage to Sherlock Holmes? Chabon has perfect pitch for literary style, obviously loves the mystery genre, and is playful enough (just look at his Yiddish Policemen's Union for his sheer joy in invention). The idea of an aged Holmes solving a mystery connected with the Holocaust only adds anticipation. And Chabon brilliantly conveys the sights and sounds of wartime England.But sadly, this book delivers little that was promised. The mystery is ultimately uninteresting, as is its solution. Characters seem to come and go, and the only ones Chabon seems to care about are ""the old man"" and the parrot.This is neither a successful literary novel nor a successful murder mystery."
3,Intriguing failure,"""A boy with a parrot on his shoulder was walking along the railway tracks."" He attracts the attention of an elderly man who has been reading The British Bee Journal. Yes, we are on the Sussex Downs, and Sherlock Holmes meets a mute 9-year-old who has escaped from Nazi Germany, and his African grey parrot, who spouts strings of German numbers.It's an intriguing idea, but I'm afraid that as a Holmes pastiche, it doesn't work very well. It's very wrong that I should figure something out before Holmes does!However, Chabon's writing is glorious, as usual. His description of Holmes' decrepitude and fear of the consequences of aging is nicely done. Read it for the writing, not the story."
5,At Equals Turns Playful & Touching,"I really found this book to be highly entertaining. A quick read, yes. But many of my favorite Sherlock Holmes stories were novellas and not novels, such as A Study In Scarlet or The Sign of Four. I commend Michael Chabon for giving us new look at ""the old man"" in his retirement. He is a lot like I imagined he would be. This is a novel with humor and puzzles, and a host of very interesting characters. Enjoy!"
4,A worthwhile read,"This is a short story, enjoyable to read. There's a lot of carping over various shortcomings, which have some validity. However, I thought it was generally well written (with some occasional overindulgence in purple prose) and the story moved along well. The numbers the parrot recites are never solved - but what numbers would a little Jewish boy escaped from a concentration camp know and repeat often so that a parrot would remember? My guess is the numbers tattoo'd on his arm. We never learn, but it would be nice to hear from Chabon."
2,I just didn't get it,"What's with all these paragraph-long sentences that must be read three times to be understood? Where's all the character development? I thought the relationship between the old man and the boy promised a rich, intriguing story, but I could never get on board. I concur with the one-star reviewer who compared the book to a jazz musician drowning you with a blizzard of technique with no texture, emotion, or dynamics. Just too much. I really think the writing got in the way of a potentially great story."
4,Sensational,"I have not used the book yet for a pattern, but it is there for when I finish my four projects in progress. I can't wait to try a vest!"
1,Beyond Awful,"Production quality was hideous. Acting, if it can be called that, was hideous. Very little ""cheerleader"" activity for a cheerleader movie. Most of the movie involves a couple mortuary idiots trying to reconstruct a cheerleader from the parts left over after a school bus runs over the lot. If this sounds sexy, it's not. They are doing all this work on life-size models that make Mattel factory doll rejects look like state-of-the-art model making. Skip the autopsy; just bury this turkey."
1,Useless item,Lot's of static. Music is barely audible...Too late to return - so it's just laying around :-(NOT recommended.
3,Handy solution to a problem,"After walking my dog, she often needs a drink. It's hard to keep a water bottle in my Jeep Wrangler JK without it rolling around. Therefore, I decided to get this item. Since it is described as a Roll Bar Drink Holder I was surprised to find that there were two items in the box. So, I now have one drink holder for each downtube of the Jeep's roll cage. They hold an aluminum bottle or the smaller standard plastic water bottles well. Since the holder is deep enough, the bottles will not fall out. Installation is very easy with the velcro straps. When the water bottle is full and you're driving on a rough road, the drink holder sways and creaks a bit. Although this is a great solution for keeping (small) water bottles in the Jeep, I do not think the product is extremely durable."
1,Did not work,"Sadly, this didn't work for my stubborn Persian cat. I'll have to look around for more ways to fix the problem!"
1,Horrible horrible horrible CAT REACTION!!!,"Tried cat attract and awoke this morning to find cat litter and feces all over 3 rooms. The cats must have thought it was cat nip because they threw this stuff everywhere!!! I am not exaggerating. This was a nightmare and when I called the company, the only redress they would provide is refund if I provide the receipt. I expect to be reimbursed for having to sterilize my floors.Please do not buy this product unless you have your cat(s) confined to a small enclosed space.Just a nightmare."
2,Cat Crazy!!,I thought this would help me but I now think I just have a crazy cat!! She plays in it and gets it everywhere!!! Tried just adding some to her regular litter and the same thing ....she plays in it spreads it everywhere and still goes in other places...smh.....gotta try something else.
5,Improved Family Photos,"After reading this book, my photos of friends and family have improved dramatically! Pets, too. I have become much more creative and have tried many more techniques. I also find I am thinking more creativly. Since my photos are much better, I am taking a lot more pictures; quality pictures. My family is happy with the results, too."
5,All charged up,I needed a new battery for my phone and this really did the trick. Shipped out on time and I am very satisfied.
1,I got about half way through.,"This is a teenagers recollections of the helicopter war in Vietnam. Most of it is reconstructions of letters and tapes he sent home to his folks. I'm trying to think of a kind word to say about it, but I can't."
3,Great for a 3 year old,"My son loves doing these colorful pasting exercises. They are really basic though, and I would think a 5 or 6 year old (recommended ages 4-6) would find them boring.Wish it were a bit bigger with more pages - he'll do about 8 of them at a time - for the price I'm not sure I'd purchase again, though with the 3 for 4 books deal, its worth it."
2,Pasting,"This book is not great for making xerox copies if you want to use it for a lot of kids. Because it is colored, the copies come out dark. Also, the cut out portions are small, and hard for the smaller kids. There are cute concepts though but not that practical to building scissoring skills."
1,not very good,Shallow with many misconceptions and meaningless arguments.I really did not like to book. Opinions in the book are tainted and filled with bias and hatred.
5,As heard on NPR (18 June 05),"I heard Bradley on NPR talking about this book, which is why I ordered it. I haven't read it yet but he sure as hell seems to know what he's talking about...(...)"
1,TOTALLY WORTHLESS VIDEO,I rated this video one star because that's the lowest I could give it. It's not worth discussing. I ran it through my shredder.
5,Looking forward to reading if it ever gets here,Have heard great reviews and can't wait to get it. The 24 hour shipping is now at 144 hours and counting. Not very happy with my first attempt to order from Amazon.com
4,"Carcassonne ""lite""","I picked up Fjords on a whim, after having already played Carcassonne (the quintessential tile laying game). I was pleasantly surprised by the even simpler gameplay offered by Fjords. While a game of Carcassonne can drag on between experienced players, Fjords offers a quick, simple alternative. Scoring is simply a matter of counting up ""owned"" territories at the end of the game. That's it...Tile drawing is, of course, random. But everything else is directly player controlled, and good (or bad) decisions can have dire consequences. Another fascinating element of Fjords is that is morphs into a different game for the 2nd half... becoming a bit of a pente mashup."
4,A reminder of what a blessing it is to pray for others!,"This book combines the devotional writings of Andrew Murray with sermon excerpts from Charles Haddon Spurgeon. It offers guidelines on how to lift others up to God for his blessings. ""God calls us into a wonderful partnership with himself,"" to intercede on behalf of others, those in need, those around us and throughout the world. This book shows us Jesus' example of prayer and reminds us what an honor and privilege it is to pray for others. ""Pray for one another,"" James 5:16."
5,"beautiful sounds, fun pop",a really nice album for the morning commute. and also the evening wind down after a hard day. the arrangements are delightful. great for all ages. this album is wonderful.
2,Shoddy Quality,"I was ecstatic when I first bought my speakers. They were functional, attractive, and the sound was excellent. Two months later my left speaker stopped working. Turns out the speaker itself wasn't broken, the audio output for the left speaker was. I surfed online and found a plethora of other people with the same problem. I'd be careful buying these speakers, they tend to have a chronic audio output problem."
3,Logitech is better,Creatives are good speaker but when it matches up to Logitech they do not match up. 1st of all Logitech's x-220's have a larger and louder sub than these. The speakers are not made of plastic as someone wrote they are made of pure solid WOOD. the sound of the two brands shouldnt even be compared. Logitechs speakers have much better LOUDER CLEARER sound! Logitech x-220s sub has 20.4 watts while the t 2900 has 17 watts. The bonus about creatives is that you may take the covers off! But i still honestly say if you want a louder sound system go with logitech!! Logitech x-220s have a output power of 64 watts while these T 2900's have a output power of 60 watts! and the style of the x-220s looks sleeker and more desighned. The creatives look all the same like all of the other sound systems. But if style and loudness doesnt bother you than purchase these since the have decent sound and the have a built in tweeter.
3,When Trumpets Fade,"Well written script, but expectation was much higher for the chosen actors to play parts. It reminded me too much from the seen in ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"" that just before they get to the good, there is an all out war seen between the north and south. This movie plays like that seen. With that being said, my heart goes out to the thousands of men who died in that battle, who did not know defeat and took their orders even if it meant death."
4,A Little Known Battle,"The makers of this film attempt to tell a story of the relatively unknown battle between American and German troops in the Huertgen Forest. In bringing across the point that this battle was tough they succeed. There is also a hint that, in a larger sense, this was an unnecessary battle. Overall the film is well done with the exception of the battle scenes. Mostly the battle scenes are contrived and in some cases unbelievable. There is at least one that brings home the full horror of war if the viewer is willing to understand what is happening to the characters. As an entertainment that attempts to shed some light on a little known event I would strongly recommend this film."
3,Some good scenes,"Historically accurate? Wearing the caps backwards like kids do now? I would give it 4 stars, but seeing how some give it 5, easily wrong, I will dock it one. Dissapointing compared to Pvt. Ryan and Stalingrad, to name a few, dissapointing after Hamburger Hill as well. In that different time, I don't think the soldiers were as profane. Thin Red Line is much better than this."
2,When Trumpets are Out of Tune,"Although the subject matter is interesting (Hurtgen Forest 44'), the film is weak. Ron Eldard does a good job in the lead role, but all of the other primary actors are poor. This is especially true Dwight Yokum who plays a sterotypical callous and ruthless battalion CO. Of course there is the angst ridden company CO and the cowardly platoon commander. The treatment of the Germans in the film is deplorable and in fact there are only handful of shots featuring German infantry. As far as simulating the actual battle, this film is a stinker. The Americans bunch up in attack like on a Sunday stroll and the Germans are able to foil an entire battalion attack with a single 88mm gun with no infantry support! If you want a good ""realistic"" war movie, buy Saving Private Ryan, Stalingrad, Tora!Tora!Tora!, The Iron Cross, or the Battle of Britain."
2,Not one of better war movies ever made,"Maybe my mistake was that I watched this after having been obsessed with Band of Brothers for the past month, watching the series all the way through 3 times and watching some episodes 4 times. When Trumpets Fade is very poor in comparison. The battle scenes weren't terrible, but the plot is poor, the acting is fairly weak, the scenery is average, and although I don't remember ever noticing the music in a movie before, the music in this gave it a very low budget feel, and I found myself checking the DVD setup for a way to play the movie without the accompanying music. Whoever made the decision on the music for this film had to have been an amature, because at times it was worse than a '70's porn movie. I am sort of a war movie buff, and if you are one of those you should probably rent this, but I cant help feeling like it was sort fo a waste of time."

4,Marcel is a Cool Dude!,"Altho I'm on a Low Carb Lifestyle, I admire Mr.D for the way hepresents his concoctions! I wonder how he can eat all thesedesserts & not gain weight! I ALSO wanna know why we can't seehis PBS ""Grilling Maestros""in Illinois. He is such a nice man!They still show the old ""Death By Choc.""& ""Burger Meister"" onDiscovery Home & Leisure but those episodes are 10 yrs.old!MORE MARCEL!!!"
4,A Compelling Argument is it.,"Galbraith's argument in this book is that since the end of World War II a larger number of Americans have prospered more and struggled less to make ends meet and their new-found contentment has changed society. These changes are because the contented class will not accept any threat to their prosperity.I'm not qualified to judge the arguments made but I found the them compelling especially given the recent lassie-faire business and anti-government trends.One major distraction in the book is Galbraith's unusual writing style. Most sentences are phrased oddly, the result sounding like something Yoda might write."
3,Been Helpful,"I use this book a lot when I am looking up lab values, especially when I work on a care plan."
2,"Nice looking, but not practical","The bamboo rods at the bottom are affixed by loops of heavy thread and the thread broke, so I am now missing a rod. Also, the snap that holds the sides together inside is anchored by very thin linen, which is starting to shred. The bag is pretty and eye catching, but I would have rather paid another $20 for a better constructed product!"
3,Native American Flute CD,Item arrived quickly. Although the 1st 2 songs skip. Other that that it plays great and the music is beautiful.
5,Believing Is Magic,"Jon Agee is one of my favorite children's author-illustrators, and this is my favorite of his picture books. Milo is a magician who just can't perform magic: he cannot pull a rabbit out of his hat. In fact, he can't even find a rabbit. Instead, he one day finds a bear: a bear for whom disappearing into and popping out of a black silk hat is a mere nothing. It's a mere nothing because the bear believes he can do it, and so he does it. To help Milo out, the bear leaps in and out of the hat like magic, wowing the crowds. But after 762 performances, the bear needs to sleep. So Milo is on his own. But this is a new Milo, strengthened by the help of a stranger (the bear) and by belief in himself. The transformation in Milo is magic. Highly recommended."
3,Magically funny,"This book is adorable -- my kids love to laugh, and this story brings them so much joy.Parent note: uses replacement words for God's name: gosh and gee."
5,One of my all time favorites,"I had to read this book in a German Lit course in college about 10 years ago. I loved it. It is a must read for any fan of ""Catcher in the Rye."" I loaned it to all my friends, unfortunately, somewhere along the line I never got it back. I have been looking for the book for about 4 years now... that is how great of a story it is. Glad to see it finally available here..."
1,Sorry form of entertainment,This movie had everything a pre-adolescent boy could desire. You would have to be 13 or a drunken truck driver to enjoy this flick.
4,Lots of favorite Playmates!,"Traci Bingham ably hosts the video by introducing some great clips of Playmates Donna D'Errico, Marliece Andrada, Erika Eleniak, Pam Anderson, Jenny McCarthy, Karin Taylor (my favorite) Heidi Mark, and Kelly Monaco. Also look for Shannon Tweed, and a Baywatch-like montage of some serious hotties!"
2,On every who's cd?,"Actually Garth Hudson, the former organist of the Band does not play on this cd (nor 'every geriatric rockstar's'). The musician you might be referring to is Al Garth ex of Loggins/Messina"
5,Pebbles - da bomb!,"This is pebbles' best work. Love ""Are You Ready?"", such a hip hop classic, love the video - Pebbles all over times square - way cool.The best song on this release had to be the hauntingly cool ""I Can't Help It."" Pebbles does not have the pipes of a Mariah or Whitney, but she doesn't need it.This release was mostly a flop, I remember buying upon it's release and immediately falling in love with it. It mostly flopped because I believe she had some kind of health problems that prevented her from promoting it, something like that which was too bad because it was full of 1995 retro to early eighties mixed with sexy mid tempo hip hop grooves.A classic for the hip hop/r&b; 'ers."
4,Very nice,"I love her voice and she is one of the most beautiful black women in the business. This is is a departure from her previous sound and most of it is very good. I was disappointed to find that the version of ""Are You Ready"" is not the same as the one played on radio. The radio version is much better! Why did this CD disappear and fail? Is Pebbles being conspired against?"
2,book needs a revision.,This book introduces bpel using oracle bpel engine beyond that this book fall short of introducing the bigger picture in terms of soa. the book also needs a revision. this book also suffers too much repetition and poor editing.
4,An aural trip back to a simpler era . . .,"""Jewface"" is a collection of (mostly) early Edison wax cylinder recordings, with lyrics that trade on many Jewish stereotypes, sung in Eastern European accents. (Warning: this album is not for the easily offended!) If you can relax and go with it, there's lots of fun listening, including a gem by Fanny Brice, and much less well-known singers, recruited from early 20th century music hall stages. Jewish and non-Jewish performers and songwriters poke innocent, and not-so-innocent (?) fun at the Jewish immigrant experience, with references to New York City's Lower East Side, and . . . the Bron-yx!"
4,"Not bad, a little modification needed","The Exaktor EXOA-2 is intended to be installed on a table saw that has at least 39 inches minimum from the blade to the edge of the table. Mine was 30 inches, so I needed to move and re-attach the vertical tube onto the horizontal tube. I also wanted to use the dust collection port that is part of the back of the saw as well as the main port on the EXOA-2. To do this I installed a diverter tube on the flexible tubing. The unit is attached to my Grizzly Dust Collector and seems to work well, reducing dust/sawdust by at least 90% or so.Setup instructions were very good, both verbally and visually.While rather expensive, the unit is well designed and built. Design allows the use of the kick-back pawls and riving knife that came with the saw."
5,AMAZING!!,"I find myself frequently refering back to this book. This is a great read for anyone wanting to tune ANY four stroke engine, motorcycle, automotive, modern or vintage. It covers tuning for every way you could drive your machine, street, drag, track racing, endurance. I would give 100 stars for this if I could. The first read through I hurried over a the tables and math, but on the second read through I broke out my motorcycles service manual and a calculator and begain easily planning out my engine modifications."
1,Don't waste your time - No longer in stock!,"This mtb shoe is no longer in stock, as a matter of fact I was told that it is sold out for the rest of the year.So don't waste your time!"
2,Only part one of LA ARAUCANA,"Buyer beware: this books contains only part one of LA ARAUCANA, the first 15 cantos published in 1569. Since the work's three parts are commonly referred to with the collective title LA ARAUCANA, and this book only gives us part one, I find the book's presentation to be very misleading. Someone unfamiliar with Ercilla's poem would not realize they are only buying part one. The publisher made no effort to disclose this information; it is only apparent upon consulting the table of contents or flipping to the end of the book. Shame on this publisher, and here's hoping Amazon changes its listing for this title to reflect this information."
3,Deep,"I had to buy and read this book for a college class. It is ok, but can get very deep and made my mind spin at times. I wouldn't read it for fun."
2,Exam Cram Network Essentials Review,"This book did provide good basic information. However, it was not enough to pass the exam. It does not tie the pieces together. In other words, Microsoft expects the exam taker to be able to apply the information in real life situations. This book does not even provide useful examples. Don't waste your time or money. There has to be something better out there."
4,Vay allah! What a great book!,Turkish people have laughed in astonishment at the phrases and words that I've used after learning them from this book. There are some mistakes in the text but these are easy to notice (mostly typos). What I like most is the the way the book concentrates on every day conversation. I love all the expressions of astonishment and especially the space-fillers used by Turks when they're thinking about what they're going to say next. I've not seen those described anywhere else! I thought the speakers on the tape were talking too quickly too soon but now I've seen some Turkish tv and understood a fair amount of what they were saying I've changed my mind.All in all I'm glad I got this book and tape pack.
4,Once upon a Christmas and twice,Wonderful movie the kids really wanted this movie for the holiday season. The service is great and fast we liked how easy it was to use Amazon.com
3,Not what I thought...,"Hmmm....I can recommend this movie for the whole family. Nothing inappropriate was in this film. I didn't really like it because the story line was cheesy and the acting was terrible. I thought it was going to be a sweet family film instead it turned out to be ....I don't know, just something else!"
5,Great soundtrack for a great movie!,Every song on this soundtrack has so much character. Especially the instrumentals by Thomas Newman!
3,The Doc continues to flatline,"I can't believe this is the same guy who wrote the cautionary tale ""Coma"", a book decades ahead of its time in terms of warning of the potential moral implications of organ transplanting. Over the past several years, though, he's been jumping onto every hot-button medical issue that hits the Nightly News--well, as Scarlett O'Hara once put it--""like a duck on a june bug"". Maybe he should take a lesson from colleague Dr. Michael Crichton about pacing himself--you notice that he's got less than half the booklist Cook has, and he's been at it years longer. Or maybe we're just forgetting that the guy's a doctor. Authors get better with experience. Maybe that's not always the case with professionals who just happen know how to write about their profession. Maybe Dr. Cook ought to take a sabbatical back into practice for awhile."
3,"Confusing scientific details, abrupt ending","Normally it only takes me a week to read a Robin Cook book; his writing tends to simplify medical jargon which allows the story to flow quickly. That is, until Chromosome 6. I found it difficult to follow the dialogue relating to DNA and how things related to one another, and for the first time I struggled to finish one of his books. I enjoyed the action sequences, especially at the end, but I did not appreciate the abrupt story ending. If the author is going to write an epilogue reflecting the main characters, he should include all of them."
3,Not as good as the others.,"Chromosome 6 started out great. Intriguing and interesting. The farther i got into the book, however, the worse it got. Some of the characters struck me as not-so-bright. I caught on to what was going on very quickly. I like to be ""in the dark"" pretty much to the last page. Most of his books are like that but this one was so obvious it almost wasn't worth finishing. Also, the ending was extremely disappointing-no closure. Not one of his best works. I will continue reading Robin's writings though. I hope this one was a fluke."
1,"he said, she said, they said","This is the first and last Robin Cook mystery for me. I listened to part of it on tape and gave up at the beginning of the second cassette. The story promised to be interesting but the dialogue was so awkward that it was a punishment to listen to. You can often really appreciate good writing when you hear it spoken by a good reader. This came off as very uninspired. Does this author know synonyms for ""said""? After reading the comments about the ending I'm glad I gave up early. Good writing can be found in everything written by James Lee Burke."
5,Science Thriller,"This is a thrilling novel about some scientists in Africa that are using cloning to create subhuman monkeys using bonobos so that their body parts can harvested for the specific human who is matched with the animal, and about a medical examiner named Jack Stapleton who discovers at the morgue in New York City while working that something strange is going on. He notices during an autopsy that a man had had a liver transplant but for some reason he has trouble finding out where and when and also the man didn't need anti - immunity drugs, in other words the body did not try to reject the liver. Jack digs deep to find the answer and the two plots finally connect. I really liked Jack Stapleton's character, and his co - worker, Laurie Montgomery, and enjoyed them in Contagion and Vector also. I felt I was educated as I read the book, it was very well detailed with scientific and medical information, but not boring, book keeps a good pace. An exciting read."
4,"Exciting story, poor ending","This is the only Robin Cook book that I have read so far. I found it to be very interesting and exciting. The medical stuff wasn't too deep that an ordinary person couldn't at least understand it to a certain extent. Plus there is a glossary of terms at the back of the book. But...the beef that I have with it, is the poor ending. I was getting so excited during the last third of the book, but the ending was so abrupt, it was like getting the wind knocked out of you. It left a lot of questions up in the air. Maybe he left it open for a part 2, I don't know. But I do wish we could know what happened with GenSys and the research facility in Cogo. Also, what happens to the Bonobos? What about Kevin, Melanie and Candace? So many questions left unanswered."
2,Cooks starts quite well but still cannot find an ending.,"In Chromosome 6 Robin Cook sets a great scene, builds both characters and suspense but as usual comes up with a lame ending. Like other Cook works, I rate this book six stars for all parts except the ending. Perhaps, the publisher should omit the ending and allow the reader to supply his own."
3,"Good idea, but...","The concept of the book is good; however, the style of writing falls short at times."
4,good overview of the wilderness movement,"A good read if you enjoy history and the outdoors. I got to read this for class, and it was a pleasant break from my text books."
3,Reviewing the Intro,how could they mention every dynasty except the niners and the cowboys? montana's 89 niners and emmit and aikman?
2,Not a good machine,"My machine broke down after only 8 month. I have broke countless needles and threads. You have to every careful with using the right setting and threads. It is also very noisy. It's probably a fine machine if you just want to do some basic sewing and repairing. Also, the warrenty is only 90 days for whole service, and 1 year for parts."
3,Very long book review,"I origianlly bought this thinking it was an actual article about Gender-Bending and Transexualism. I was disappointed to find it was a book review. So, I bought the book. The article is detailed and well written, addressing the book's strengths and flaws. It made me somewhat regret buying the book but by the end, I had decided that I would have to read the book itself and come to my own conclusion."
4,Flannery O'Connor,"At first, I would have to say that I was impressed with this book. But upon looking back at all I have read, I realized that there is one true Giant of Southern fiction, of all fiction...Flannery O'Connor. If you liked this book, I urge you to run, not walk, to the nearest source of Flannery O'Connor. She is a dream come true."
3,what happened to the ending?,"The picture that Reynolds painted of religious tabacco country was pleasing to read. While the characters were not very deep, they underscored the righteous fury they must have contained within themselves. I wish there would have been more to the ending. The book's symbolism (Ninah's Mary and Canaan's Christ) were thought-provoking, but the ending just...hung. What about the predictable power struggle? How would Laura feel about Ninah's promise to Canaan? How does Nanna handle her husband's inevitable demise? I just did not feel this story had a satisfactory climax."
3,Just Okay,"I enjoyed this book enough to finish reading, but I just didn't find the characters believable. The book started off pretty engaging, but really sputtered about 3/4 of the way through.The main character is a young teenager who has been endoctrinated her whole life into this ""cult"" however even at a young age her doubts are louder then her faith.Grampa Hermen leads the congregation and executes punishments however even own wife doesn't care for his leadership and expecially not for the punishement he delivers, she doesn't really listen to his sermons, however she seems to be totally in love with him. huh?If you love to read books with vivid character descriptions, character you grow to care about, leave this book on the shelf.If you just want to escape with a quick read you might like this book."
3,The rapture of Canaan,"The Rapture of Canaan is a book told through the eyes of a young girl named Ninah. Ninah lives with the rest of her family at the Church of Fire and Brimstone and God's almighty Baptizing Wind. A church runby Ninahs Grandfather Herman who beilves that even the simplest sin is ground for harsh punishment. Even though she was raised under the hands of Herman, Ninah is the subject of one of the worst sins, fornication. With a baby coming and no way to tell anyone Ninah is in a spot that will test her religion and everyone in the communitys.I thought this book was well written and very eye opening to tight knit religious communitys, but as a story it seemed all to common with the story of a teen age girl in trouble and no one to help her. The plot always seemed to get boring. Three stars for its critique style and its eye opening views."
5,Couldn't put it down,"I read the first 250 pages in one fell swoop on a train ride, then finished the rest on the return trip. Gripping, heart-wrenching, touching. Wonderful story-telling. I didn't want it to end."
1,This book bites,"This book was horrible. It was the first Oprah book I ever read and now I am totally turned off to her books. The book was BORING. I did finish it tho, just to see if something interesting would happen. Nothing did."
2,"Boring, found myself skipping full paragraphs","The punishments, rules, and outrageous sermons get a little old in this book. I actually said outloud ""ok, we get it, it's a religous cult!"" Enough already. I think this book starts out pretty good but gets so dry and boring. And did the author really have to come up with the longest name ever for this churt - Fire and Brimstone and BLAH BLAH BLAH. And all the stuff about ""If so and so sins, he shall pay $100, half to this dude and half to the Church of Fire and Brimstone blah blah"" Ok, we get it. Geesh. I would just check this book out from the library instead of buying it."
1,Eddie Bauer PE701,"I was unfortunate enough to get the previous model and upon using it the 2nd time I noticed the end of the cigarette lighter that goes into the DVD player would come loose easily.I e-mailed Audiovox about the problem and they told me to ship it back and I did and they have since sent me an invoice for money for $168 for repairs. They won't work on the player until they recieve the $168. I called to find out what was wrong with the player and they said they wouldn't know until a technician looked at it. I just about lost it at that point.You have to realize I have only had the player for less than 6 months, but the warranty is for only 90 days. That isn't very long for a warranty. I'm very disappointed with Audiovox and their services.I have told them to ship the player back to me unrepaired. I can buy a new one for that price and it won't be an Audiovox either.I hope everyone has better luck with the newer model."
3,Like the song and music.,"I liked the song and the music but it did not lend itself to what I was using a song for. Like to listen to it but probably would not sing it, especially for Christmas."
4,Very distracting Video Direction!!!,"Beautiful Aida production by Zefferelli at La Scala Milan. This production is a little over done but beautifully set. The singers are amazing except that I found Alagna's infamous aria ""Dolce Aida"" to be sung in an almost forced and yelling voice. So far, I have just watched the Acts 1&2 first DVD, and so far I can tell you that you will be dissapointed by the anoying fading of pictures throught the video. This is done in a manner that you want to scream and say stop doing that!!!Just focus on the characters and lets enjoy the performance in a way that a seating patron there was enjoying it. By, the way the ballet at the end of Act 2 was very sexy and beautifully danced. 4 stars for the singing 5 stars for the ballet and 5 star for the sets and costumes. 0 star for the video direction."
1,Verdi Aida on blu ray,"The poor Decca engineers cant be musicians,because although the visuals are fine,the sound is dry,the female voices become unappealing.Its my faulti keep hoping Roberto Alagna will produce a bel canto head voice,he sounds almost baritone like.The rest chorus etc again dryunappealing,what are they doing,these poor decca engineers.J Escott"
4,American Heart Association No-Fad Diet,"No-nonsense approach to effective weight-loss for anyone even tho it's authored by the American Heart Association. Good, sound advice, lots of great recipes."
3,Good pickins' from the memories of those who played it,"Ms. Boyd (no relation to the Boyd brothers Bill, Jim and Clyde who hotted up the radio waves around Dallas in the late '40s) went to the trouble to look up many of the stars of western swing and record their stories.It's a workmanlike effort, clearly stating its generalizations from the oral histories, and offering many quotes from those who played with Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys, the Sons of the Pioneers, and dozens of the less famous and more specialized bands.There are a number of pages of photographs."
5,touching,I originally bought this book for my husband and he recommended that I read it as well. This is a very touching story and I loved the layout of this book compared to others that told the same story. Read it!!!
1,For modern-instrument or oboe aficionados only!,"I have to agree with the reviewer below (click on ""See All Reviews"") that this recording is ""dull as dishwater.""Of course, I am a great fan of period-instrument and ""historically informed"" performances. I have nothing against modern instruments, but I do dislike modern performance practices such as excess vibrato and flat, even phrasings (such as one finds on this Holliger/Zelenka recording).Zelenka's music itself is wonderful -- but I would first and foremost recommend the CPO label's 3-disc recording of Zelenka's orchestral music, with the ""Neu-Eroeffnete Orchester"" ensemble.I suspect that my review will be rated as ""not useful,"" because that's how most negative reviews seem to be judged here on Amazon. But I want to warn the tentative purchaser of this set that they may not find it money well worth spent. I listened to the first few tracks of Holliger's recording, and really tried to like it, but tossed it on the ""discard"" pile almost immediately."
1,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"Well, I love Maggie Smith so I thought this would be thoroughly entertaining at the very least. Boy was I wrong. Too much proper gibberish for my taste, and just so dull and lifeless. Most exciting part was when one of the frumpy girls jumped out the window, and then you never even knew what happened to her. Two hours down the drain."
5,The Prime of Miss Maggie Smith,"She shows astonishing range in this film, masterfully navigating the contradictions of a troubling, charismatic and possibly mad woman. I'm not given to hyperbole, but I'd rank this among the five or so finest performances ever by a film actress. It's funny, but this film was a financial bust when it was first released in 1969, and yet it endures. Goes to show, cream eventually does rise."
5,come on,"For anyone who rants on about how they thought that the book was going to be about the history of emo is obviously assuming. Lets not judge a book by it's cover-literally. The book briefly described a background to the emo music scene, and went further in depth on the emo in the present day. The generation Andy Greenwald is talking about was the exact generation I was very much a part of, and I believe it to be a very precise, and on target hit to the world of the so called ""emo"" scene today and a few major parts of it. If Greenwald wanted to go in depth about the history of emo and punk rock, he would need 5 novels to complete it. Not only did I find this a good read, but being a journalism major, I thought it was very well laid out, written, and inspirational!"
3,NOT an emo history,"I read only a few pages of this book, but from that I can tell you it's not a history; it's more of an exploration of how emo bands and their fans have this itimate relationship that doesn't happen in other genres. It's a good book and people should just chill out. My one criticism is it makes it seem as though everyone who listens to emo is on the verge of suicide. Yeah, we're outcasts and the music speaks to us, but there's a bit too much of the ""music as salvation"" bit."
3,"ay, medium all the way","It may just skim the surface of a few great bands (Jawbreaker, Sunny Day Real Estate, and Rites of spring) but it is interesting to read. I could have done without the endless droaning on about Dashboard, but all in all, worth the time."
1,Absurd,"The very concept of this book is ridiculous. It's almost a self-parody. The author, it seems, is too dumb to realize quite a few things: A) the bands discussed in this book are on the same corporate caliber as the bands it denounces. B) bands like Jimmy Eat World, Thursday, and Dashboard Confessional are not elusive indie acts, they are millionares and any rock radio station you tune into will gladly cram them down your throat. C) Said bands do not fall under the true category of emo. D) Obviously publishing a book like this will only further exploit and distort the popular image of the very music it supposedly holds sacred.If this book looks like it would even remotely appeal to you, do us all a favor and waste your money on it."
3,low quality product,this wood is more cheap than i had imagined. yes it is light but that's just turning the fact that it's cheap into a sales pitch. it's hollow and feels fragile. it feels like barely a step up from cardboard. the black finish is nice and it serves its purpose but i wonder how much more it would have costed to have solid wood instead.
2,mattress is lame,"This co-sleeper is just ok. I do not attach it to the bed- I use it the same way you would a crib. It's a little tricky to assemble and my husband hasn't had to break it down for any reason. My main complaint is the mattress... it's way too hard. My husband found an quilted pad online specifically made to fit this bassinet but it didn't do much good. The Arm's Reach website has an organic mattress for $120 but that's crazy expensive! I ended up carefully folding a microfiber throw to fit over the mattress and then covered both with a jersey fitted sheet. While it's not the best solution, it's the only way my baby will sleep in this bassinet.I wish I would not have registered for this product."
4,Wonderful to have baby close!,"I really love the co-sleeper and wish I had purchased this with my two older children. It is such a piece of mind to have baby right next to you, but still safe in his own bed. Easy acess for nursing, no need to get up out of bed. I just want to mention that if you plan to use the co-sleeper for more than a few months, (and if you have the space) you may want to consider the original vs. the Mini. I wish I had. My 5 month old son is big and has really grown out of it, but I cannot part with it just yet! Another note: I have a pillowtop mattress and purchased the leg extenders and they worked out perfectly to make it level with my bed."
4,Works great for us,We bought this bed for use on our beach trip. Our son is 21 months old and average size. We used it as a cosleeper like our stokke crib is used at home and he was very happy in it. We put a eddie bauer quilted sheet on the bed and it was softer.
5,We love this!,We were given this co-sleeper by a friend and absolutely love it. The baby is close by and it makes night time feedings go much smoother.
5,MUST HAVE!!,"This co-sleeper is the best!! If you are thinking of getting anything other than this (i.e., bassinet, `cradle) don't!!! Get this. Item give baby enough room to grow and move. Waking up every three hours is hard enough! With this co-sleeper, you can omit having to leave your cozy bed (if breastfeeding). Just reach over and pick up your baby and feed. It sits right by your bed and is safe!!"
2,"Received Yesterday, Returning it Today","I just received our co-sleeper yesterday but am returning it today. I purchased the co-sleeper because my seven-week old son sleeps great when he sleeps with us, but slept very poorly in his bassinet. If you haven't bought a bassinet yet then I can see how this product would be just as good, but it basically is a large bassinet. I thought it would be directly even with our mattress so I could snuggle my son at night, but the mattress sits a couple inches below the side of the co-sleeper, making it impossible to cuddle up with him. ALSO...the mattress it comes with is EXTREMELY HARD. I know babies are suppose to sleep on hard surfaces, but this is so hard it has to be uncomfortable. VERY DISSAPOINTED. We also have a pack n' go bed which is pretty much THE SAME thing as this co-sleeper. The only difference is the co-sleeper has one side that folds down."
3,Call Me Old-Fashioned ...,"Despite good production values, the orchestrations and cues here largely don't work. High points: A male interpretation of ""Surrender,"" FRWL as a sort of folk song, and, of course, the Bond theme. The rest is simply odd or downright awful."
5,Add Excitement to Your Cooking,I got this book from the library and have just been totally awestruck by the recipes. We are planning a trip to Spain in October and I picked this up to get an idea of what to expect from the Spanish cuisine. We can't believe the delicious and exciting recipes in this book -- and they are surprisingly easy to prepare. I am heartbroken that it is currently unavailable and hope to luck out and find a copy of it at some point in time.
5,Best iron grill pan on the market,"I've bought a bunch of iron pans, and Lodge makes the best iron pans. This particular grill pan of theirs lives up to expectations. Heats evenly, can accommodate most pan covers, and cooks and leaves those great grill marks."
2,Lodge Cast Iron Grill Pan or Stick Pan,"Nice and heavy, Man I have cooked in this pan every way you can and food just plans sticks, I mean really sticks. You have to scrub it with a brush, scotch brite pad with salt, etc. I have seasoned it a dozen times and food still stick bad. I do not recommend this pan, Sorry"
5,The soapmaker: natural homemade soap from your kitchen,Great book with a good variety of soap recipes. Good instruction on how to create her yummy soaps. Such a good book for those of us who can't use harsh chemicals. The cream soaps are a unique twist on handmilled soaps. This is great book for any soap or craft library.
5,Very very very fun!!!,"This is one of my favorite games of all time! These are the highlights.1. You get a choice of three characters; Sly, Bentley and Murray.2. There are many different moves and attacks that are fun and make you feel mysterious and ""sly"".3. Wonderful worlds to delve into.4. Really cool jobs and missions to complete without a set order or limit on how much ""exploring"" you get to do.5. Cool collectables like coins, picpocketed items, booby-trapped loot, and mysterious clue bottles scattered all over the levels.There is nothing about this game that I don't like. It is far more advanced the the first game, and makes you feel a whole lot more stealthy. It's incredible how real it can feel when you're playing it!Caution to parents: Make sure your kids don't start using long, stick-like objects as weapons and make sure you explain that stealing is NOT on any level okay. Basically, the game is pretty well balanced."
5,"Works Great With Windows Mobile 6, Live Search and Google Maps ""Locate Me""","I own the Samsung i760 PDA with 320*240 screen and use this GPS to send GPS data to Google Maps and MS Live Search mobile (both are free). I the can view the real-time aerial/satellite ""up ahead"" just like the government has been doing in the movies. I use a combined power and data/sync cable from Pocket Connections, an air vent PDA car mount. PDANet software lets me tether the Samsung to my laptops USB connection using MS Active sync.It took a while to come up to speed but this is the killer configuration which everyone who I show it to wants. It's all great fun especially talking to Live Search through Windows Mobile 6 asking for ""Starbucks"" nearby and then having their locations and address appear on the PDA.Samsung i760 Black Phone (Verizon Wireless)"
1,Disappointed,"I have spent 2-3 hours trying to getting this unit to function. The internal light comes on, the computer says there is a device out there, but can't get it to work. Probably my lack of understanding, but the printed guideance leaves something to be desired. I'm going to try it on another computer."
5,Great Bluetooth accessory for Streets and Trips and Pharos GPS,The Bluetooth dock has plenty of power and works great in my car. It is small and unobtrusive. I use it with my laptop and my PDA.
3,Fine game but shows its age,"This was the game that introduced me to the total war series. In its time it was wonderful, I would give it 5 stars then. Today of course it is totally outmoded. However, I bought it to play it on an older computer I have when I'm away from home, and it is still fun. The only problem really is the graphics (the soldiers look terrible compared with today's standards). The game has many cool aspects that were lost in the more modern titles."
3,Play Medieval Now,"Medieval Total War is entertaining because it allows the player to step back into the pass and relived history. Playing different factions in this game can give us an insight understanding as to how today's religious and political affairs are shaped, not to mention that we become familiarized with European's map.There are three things that I think take away the fun:1. There's no way of communicating with an allied faction for a joint attack2. Too many revolts occured3. Once the played faction become powerful, other factions just play as a ""Sitting Dead Duck,"" waiting for theplayed faction to attack it. Other factions does not know how to join forces to fight back. One factioncannot borrowed army from another allied faction to aide it.Over all, if you have any background on European history or are interested in military history, play this game."
1,A description....,"From Back Cover:Although they were engaged, Terry Morgon would not marry Kay Sheridan until he had uncovered his past. He must find his unknown mother and discover her origins.The search led Kay and Terry into the vast unknown Sahara, to a new way of life among the strange, wild Tuareg tribe - and also to a new love for Kay. But what was she going to do about Terry?"
4,Very Thin stately watch,TheSteinhausen Dunn Horitzen Victorian Watch-Gold-TW518Gwatch is not a bulky thick watch. Thick watches seem to be the norm for many watch offerings on the net. The thin construction of the Steinhausen makes it a fine dress watch which can also be used for casual wear. The black and brown watch bands which come with the Steinhausen add flexibility to the choice of dress or casual wear.
2,Not an attention keeper,I realize the pictures come from Highlights but the they're all in black and white and did not keep the interest of my daughter for very long at all.
4,"Doesn't have pictures of items, only written descriptions!","If you have younger kids (pre-reading), please note that unlike the Highlights magazine section, this book doesn't show pictures of the hidden items to find, only written descriptions. This means that if your kids cannot read yet, they cannot play on their own. I was disappointed because they love to do the section in the Highlights magazine and I had assumed that this book would be the same."
2,Jackie's quality is slipping and so is our value for money,"I read all four in the series only because I made the mistake of buying them all at one time. Otherwise, I never would've bought number two. I loved all her early books but the last couple of years it's been hard to even finish the books. Come on Jackie, give us some reading with the quality and excitement of Chances, etc.Further, to write four books at $4.00 each (=$16.00) for one boring, dull story is a total moneymaking deal for you and a rip off for your loyal readers."
2,Easy light reading for a two-hour commute.,"Mildly suspenseful; doesn't require a lot of concentration, which is why it was perfect reading on a recent long bus ride. I thought each installment was a story unto itself -- I guess it was interesting enough to me that I plan to buy the all inclusive ""LA Connections"" so I can start at the beginning and get to the conclusion. I never before read a book by this author, and except for this series, I doubt I will read her books in the future. ""Murder"" was very formulaic and the characters very stereotypical."
5,"If fugues be the food of love, play on!","First off, the only complaint I have about this wonderful 2-CD set is its length, only 92 minutes. That said, I encourage every ""piano nut"" in the world to get it. I bought it for Busoni's ""Fantasia contrappuntistica for two pianos,"" as I'm a Bach fan. (I bought Gould's ""Art of Fugue"" last week. Run to the store, don't walk.) The set is bookended by the divine Mozart, with Reger's variations on a Beethoven bagatelle the other piece. All 4 works are special. You can buy it for that fact. Or, you can buy it for the high level of playing from these two guys. And no, I wouldn't recommend this CD to the novice. I guess I covered everything: great music, great playing. Highly recommended."
5,Great Product,"I had gotten a reversible grill/griddle from Wisconsin and was completely disappointed (food burned on easily, never washed off and was just a mess), so I was a little shaky about buying another, but I really wanted the convienence of a reversible grill/griddle. But the Lodge is great: food just flakes up off of it (no soap!), making cleaning quick and easy. I can cook pancakes, bacon and eggs in the morning and then grilled cheese in the afternoon and one doesn't taste like the other. I'm just very happy with this product. However, it is heavy, so be prepared for that. And with the pre-seasoned has handles, so it may or may not fit into your oven. Be prepared for that. And every time you cook with it, you need to oil it. Be prepared for that, too. But other than that, this is a great product that a kitchen is lucky to have."
2,Mediocre typesetting,"No distinction is made between hyphens and dashes, and there are plenty of both in the book. Buy a different edition."
4,Solid Movie,"The only reason I purchased this film is because my daughter is the biggest Fan of Toni Braxton, but I must admit that the movie was rather better than I expected it to be, but it still was not something that I would give 2 thubs up to. The movie starts off kind of slow, but in the end it picks up, to a very bad ending, where a video plays and the movie ends. I would rate this movie with a B-."
5,Bird Bath,I love this Quick Lock Bird Bath. Easy to use and you can put seeds in it on the days it not being used for a bath. Fantastic.
3,Ok product,Almost too small to use for water and using fir food birds will waste all of your food buy enclosed bath
4,slow cooking,good recipes and excellent balance of food products with no difficult to find ingredients. The healthy part was my primary reason for purchasing and it does provide that in most cases.
2,Best of Freud!,"if you think ur a sick snake n placed with sicker snakes...voila! CURED... oh well, father vs husband, only crazy people dance and sing, many sadist scenes that make one more insane, job security? never been in a mental institution and only remember ""Splendor in the Grass"" which was a far cry from this mess... most exciting aspect of dialogue was Miss Mellie using her real voice, wow that was a shocker, shoulda made her watch GWTW and contrast the vocals... figured those baths were nice n toasty and they were putting cool towels on the head to improve comfort... all I know is that Carrie Fischer is a huge proponent of ECT, now with anastesia.... mega sympathies for souls going thru hell anywhere near this story but glad this had a happy ending, some docs really do care!"
3,Easy to Install...If the parts fit together,"I received this as envisioned and was eager to set this up for my cat. It was super easy to screw in the wall but I hit a road block when I came to the ""easy"" step of snapping in the legs: they DO NOT ""snap"". I don't know if they manufactured the legs improperly or if this is just a crappy item, but I'm not dumb and know how to snap in a piece. I'm a swimmer and have more upper body strength than most of my male friends. These legs would NOT snap in. I was afraid I was going to break the actual perch so I'm just returning this."
1,K&H Kitty Sill is Very Poor Quality,"I purchased the K&H MFG Kitty Sill through an online store. When it arrived, I was surprised by the poor quality of the sill. It is made of plastic and a flimsy plastic that is just a frame and not even solid. I installed it using the velcro and allowed the velcro glue to set for 24 hours as per the instructions. Within 4 days of use by my cats, the Kitty Sill came crashing down with my cat on it. Thankfully, my cat was uninjured. I contacted K&H Mfg and their first reply was that I did not install it correctly. When I said that I followed the instructions, their second reply was that I should go purchase more velcro and try again. If you don't mind paying for a cheap sill that may endanger you cat's life then this is the kitty sill for you, otherwise avoid it like the plaque!"
1,Not the greatest Kitty Sill.,"The velcro attachments were way too small, not strong enough to keep sill attached - in fact, I came home to find a very unhappy cat and discovered the kitty sill on the floor. Also, the plastic legs are flimsy and kept coming out of the slots in the sill. I have had a better kitty sill before. Sorry I wasted the money on this one."
3,Brackets wouldn't stay in place.,"Before purchasing this K & H Kitty Sill, I read reviews galore about this and many others. In the end, I had to screw this seat to the window sill because the brackets wouldn't stay in the slots (and still fell off even after using the screws). The cats use it, but I have not seen them lying on it like in the picture."
1,do not buy this!,"this item requires you to purchase double back velcro tape and tape the kitty bed to your windowsill! Not only will you damage your windowsills by putting TAPE on them, but if you have a heavy cat, the other side of the velcro tape is sure to come off and send your kitty to the floor when he tries to jump onto the bed. Do not buy this product as it is cheaply put together. While the faux wool bedding is nice and comfy, the handles on the bottom do not set well against the wall and there is no easy place to put velcro tape on the bottom of the bed.We bought ours and once we saw how it is to be installed, it went into our ""donation"" pile. Try to find a kitty bed that has hooks (not velcro) which will hold the top of the bed to the windowsill frame."
3,School text book,I needed this book for a class. This book is rich in biology and fluid mechanics that it was way over my head. My professor explained things that we needed to know much simplier than this book did.
3,good book,Its agood book on how to build the craft urself..I bought it for my 4 1/2 yr old daughter.n she njoys doing it with me...
4,Great crafts on sturdy paper,"Very colorful, simple and yet detailed artwork. My almost 3 year old needs alot of help with these but he loves them. A good way to get your child away from the tv and using his hands to create something."
4,this camera is very good,"I like this camera ,it id very cheap and takes pictures wonderful , only one thing the battery the seller provided can only shot for less than 20 photos is little bad . so i use Ni_Mh battery .it works well ."
1,Terrible waste of time and money. . . .,"I rented this one yesterday. . and all I can say is I'm wanting my $4.50 to "" comeback "". This movie is horrible. It's not even worth the plastic it's printed on."
4,Another quality Lodge product,"This 7 quart dutch oven is perfect for bread, beans, and other campground fair. The bonus here is that the lid to the 7 quart model is the perfect size for the 12"" Lodge skillet thus serving double duty.I've used this to cook a few loaves of Sourdough and for that purpose alone it's worth every penny."
5,Versatile Cooker,"This is a great all-around pot. I've used in in the oven, on top of the stove and to create some great slow cooked braised dishes on my grill. Cleans up easily. It is however very heavy and when full of food, can be a chore to move."
5,My Very First,"This is my first dutch oven, I read over and over all the reviews to make sure I was getting a good product. I have now made several recipes this week with chicken and everything came out great. Thanks everyone for the tips."
4,Glad I chose it!,"After using my grandfather's hand-me-down cast iron skillet for two decades, I decided it was time to spend $200 on a new one. I read dozens of reviews, including Cooks Illustrated, Target, Amazon, etc. I am VERY happy I chose the Lodge. Stews, roasts, Mediterranean dishes (recommending a Tagine), even bread, cook perfectly The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the weight when taking it out of oven with a stew or roast. Use proper lifting posture (bend knees and use leg muscles, not back) and it's fine. And I saved about $130."
1,Some applied merit,"I have given this book several reads. It has some merit in application. However, the book has little substance. It is organized well and this helps to make the book seem it has more to offer than it does."
1,Lots of really ugly hats,"I am kind of shocked at how many ugly hats the editors of Vogue could cram into this little book. I expect there to be a few --it is, afterall, a matter of taste--but I just couldn't believe page, after page, of hideousness. There are 2 or 3 okay looking hats in this book and the rest look like something you'd wear to a shriner's convention, or cover your teapot with. It is such ashame, as these little books are such a good idea. The Vogue knitting Mittens & gloves book is much better, if you can get passed the gloves on the cover. What were they thinking?"
1,Here's a book of track layouts without plans or value.,"This book is seriuosly flawed; for it gives the reader none of the planning details necessary to build, operate or maintain an N scale model railroad. (Even the ones in the book !!) What are the realistic curves for 60' box cars, a 4-6-6-4, or dome streamliner cars? Where are the power feeds, realistic block divisions, or decouplers? What are the switch dimensions, what is a ""no. 4 turnout"", what' a no. 6, what's the spacing for a ladder?? Three or four pages of technical data would have made this a useful publication for plans. Model Railroader, which usually produces good to excellent books, did a very poor job with this one. If your a beginner in the hobby, you will get better information from two or three issues of Model Railroader, itself."
4,"A clever new way to tell an old, familiar story","PageLand first grabbed my attention because of it's humourously drawn cover art. With its quirky illustrations, this book ""about love and sharing and working together"" makes the Gospel story come alive in a fresh and creative way. A fun read for anyone, it is an even better tool for presenting Christian truth to those who are either unfamiliar with it or even overly familiar with it.PageLand offers a depth of insight that is challenging for adults and children alike. It is written with a sort of simplicity appropriate for children, yet its message is so timeless and its situations so truly deep that even adult readers are bound to appreciate it. A short, but pleasurable read, it succeeds in being one of those rare, simple, profound, enjoyable books for readers of all ages."
1,Software is for older CPU's,"Beware this software is not intended for new CPU's, I have a new CPU and after several emails to the software techs it was determined that my CPU is too new to run the program. While my CPU meets the minumim requirements, there needs to be a maximum that it can accomidate"
1,"Poor arguments, manipulated and possibly invented facts makes jack an dull boy.","I have come to expect this sort of stuff from some historians...I could not believe that Nat Geo would actually participate in such a method deviation and fact manipulation. The ""real"" George Washington, yea right. I no longer feel safe watching history! Every time, I'm like how much are they twisting and fabricating? Soon I will not be sure if everything I know of history is actual or full of....lies. Having discovered several other Nat Geo's accounts to be similar....they seem to be DOUBTABLE, and in the back of my mind, I'm like it's probably full of... Why would they do that to us? What is the point? Perhaps they should be called ""National Propaganda Machine of Geography""."
2,the hunchback of Notre Kings,"OK, the Little Beaver is one of the all-time greats but did he ever skate hunched over using his stick as some sort of divining rod? What is up with the positioning of the figure? Sorry, that's a fail."
5,A rich and playful jaunt,"Anyone who criticizes this novel as slow should go back to comic books. ""The Seven Sisters"" is a literary novel, meant to be savored.The cleverly-named Candida reveals herself in surprising ways. Though not as ambitious a work as Joyce's ""Ulysses"", Drabble's references to the ""Aeneid"" guide us as we follow Candida on her travels.This is a complex novel, exploring the metamorphosis of a seemingly ordinary woman."
2,"Accessories are nice, but it didn't work well at all","I bought this to use at the data center where I work. Had almost 1,000 circuits to find and verify that the receptacles were labeled properly. It worked on a few circuits, but it was so hit-or-miss that I didn't trust that it correctly identified the breakers that it toned on. I brought in my circuit finder that I use at home which is made by Ideal and it worked perfectly. Plus the Ideal circuit finder is $70 cheaper than this unit.I did like the accessories that came with this unit, but that's about all. In fact, I cut the leads off of the tone generator, wired them onto an electrical cord, and used it with my circuit finder.It might be good for home use, but really it should work anywhere if it is a good product and does what it is supposed to do."
3,Not quite what I expected,"I bought this product specifically to trace wires behind sheet rock walls. However, it will not sense the wires unless it is within an inch or two of them. It is fairly selective for determining which wire the signal is on in a bundle - if this is what you need to do this instrument is a good choice.A better tool for sensing wires up to 2 feet away is the Fluke/Harris MB6000 Probe kit."
1,Stay Away,I will be calling the company as nothing worked the way it was suppose to. The ink is old and wouldn't take the fingerprints right and then we tried the dusting stuff for the fingerprints and its all clumped up. Don't know if it was just mine or a bad batch. Not worth it!
3,A mixed bag with lots of feel good factor,"I have to say that it is lovely book with stupid plot.Georgia's mother - made to believe that being smart and beautiful makes you a target for sexual harassment and transfering the same believes into her daughter through manipulation in oder to curb Georgia's interest in science and engineering. And Georgia allowing her mother to shape her entire life. Hard to believe from both sides.But then there is a very nice attempt to capture Southern charm and way of life. And steamy lovemaking descriptions that make for good bedtime reading.All in all, stupid plot, somhow lacking in character development but charming chick flick nonetheless."
2,2 stars at best,"If I could give this book 1 1/2 stars, I would - unfortunately the system's not set up to give half-stars. I found this southern chick lit style book to be the least-believeable of all the chick lit books I've read that are set in the south.The intimate scenes were unnecessary as far as plot or character development goes, and the friendships on the whole were fairly two-dimensional.The main scenario with the daughter being afraid to 'be smart' in front of her mother and share her inventions was highly unbelievable. And the reason for the mom being afraid of her daughter being a smart girl and woman was frankly stupid coming from a clever, manipulative woman that she was, especially after said daughter was now an ADULT and not a vulnerable child.The twist at the end was beyond ludicrous, and that is putting it mildly.The only thing that kept me going was my innate urge to finish what I start - not always a useful trait, in this situation."
4,i really love this cd,"Okay so I'll admit that not every song is awesome, but overall it's a really good cd that I can't take out of my changer just yet and I've had it since the day it came out. smart went crazy is my absolute favorite. on this album it seems slug didn't put as much meaning into his rhymes, just wrote things because they happened to rhyme without any real depth. oh yeah and to the guy who said they're still underground, i bought the cd at target, not very hard to locate... but they're not mainstream yet either... anyways, i recommend this cd to anyone who is interested in getting into hip-hop or already likes it."
2,"Weak lyrics, tight beats (same old same)","Lyrics: Put simply, Slug needs to man up. He's got talent, but he comes across like a whiney little girl. He STILL hasn't gotten out of that and he's STILL going on about that Lucy chick. The hell with this! If you want good, intelligent underground stuff...check out some of his labelmates. Brother Ali and Blueprint both spit CIRCLES around this punk!Beats: Dope."
4,New user,"I heard this on Sirius sat. radio. This guy is great. His other band Felt has some good tunes too. Best line. ""And with a mad grill, he asks who the f are you, don't worry man, someday I'ma be nobody too."" White guys are the best rappers nowdays."
4,Good scale with very nice digital display,"Okay, the title says it all: good scale with a very nice digital display. This unit is comparable to some at retail stores costing $10 more. I'm glad I got it and with super saver shipping/no sales tax, it was a great price."
3,"Decent, nothing special","Aside from it being a ""digital"" scale there is nothing special about the scale. In my opinion, it's not as sturdy as the traditional ones with the needle hands, despite it has a more ""precise"" reading and display.At night, since it's not back lit, you still can't see the numbers.It takes a while for the scale to register the weight and show it to you. I'm guessing that's pretty standard for all the digital scales?Its accuracy depends on the surface it sits on. Seems to like tile and hard floors more than carpet. Again, might just be a standard scale thing.We have a very old, sick cat. We've been using it to weight the cat while we hold the cat in our arms. Seems to work fine.Not sure if the scale has a break-in period, but it seems to work better now that it's been used for a couple of weeks.In the end, it's a keeper."
1,So Disappointed,"I can't believe I'm saying this about a Bioware game, but this expansion has got to be the ""cheapest"" (short, they say 20 hours long, but I completed the whole thing in less than 10 hours), most boring, most expensive $$ expansion they have ever released. I own practically every Bioware game ever made, and have loved every one of them... except for this one. I have downloaded and played mods that other players have created that were more exciting and more thoughtfully created that SoU. In my opinion, Bioware was in a hurry on this one, and let greed get in the way of creativity. All I can hope is that the next expansion is exciting, REPLAYABLE, LONGER!!!, and an all around better continuation of the NWN's story. If not, I will begin to wonder whether to spend any more money on Bioware creations."
5,A must read for dog training!!!,"I have thoroughtly enjoyed reading this book. The author has a wonderfully descriptive way of helping the reader understand dog psychology and the canine learning process. I found the book to be both extremely informative and humorous. The use of story telling to convey information is very effective and absorbing. Technically the book is extremely well written, far better than many books on the subject. The author's knowledge of dogs and her obvious pleasure in training them generatess enthusiasm for the reader and encourages capable, caring dog training. I have read many dozens of books on this subject and this is one of the very best."
3,a much-anticipated second novel,"It took a long time for Blue to be published, and it is obvious that Van Arsdale spent a lot of time revising and editing this lyrical novel. She successfully explores amnesia, loss, memory, families and small-town life. Though Annie, Blue, Dr. Reichman and Rita are all very different, they have one thing in common-- their life did not turn out the way they expected. One small caveat--the ending is a little disappointing, especially since one comes to really care about the characters."
1,less than you pay for is an understatement....,"First off, the recommened age (36mo. to 6yr.)is a joke. You couldn't sit a 5-6 year old at this desk unless it was resting on there knees. The drawer was broken, the legs looked like they been kicked around in the warehouse and only one of the legs had the hole for the paper roll. On the bright side, I only wasted $30."
4,Love it.....but....,"You need to be careful when putting this desk together. It can break the wood at delicate points. My 3 year old LOVES this desk and spends hours drawing. It is worth the money, but be careful how fast you screw it together."
4,Just right.,"These scales were just what I needed for my kitchen. The simple design fits right into a drawer and I've had no trouble lifting by the platform, though some sort of handle grip placement would have been nice."
5,DVD 2003,It was really nice to see the videos of Journey. The quality of the videos were crystal clear. Definitely worth the money
2,Journey Greatest Hits,"I have loved Journey since i was 15, and being able to re-live that time is great, but this dvd has problems. It's like watching an old chinese movie. Their voices and the music is askew.The music and voices and their mouths moving do not match. I thought i had bought a bad dvd, so i purchased a brand new one and it did the same thing. SO, if you love Journey, maybe try buying something else.signedDISAPOINTED"
5,Journey Greatest Hits DVD,"Great trip down memory lane. If you love Steve Perry, you will love this DVD. The quality is excellent."
2,poor dvd quality,The content of this dvd is exceptional - my 2 and a half year old loves all the songs. however after playing it a few times the dvd started skipping and halting. tried cleaning it to no avail.
2,"uh,",i alweays thought it was boring the only thing i really really liked about it was seeing big tosha-thats all!
1,Incorrect part,"Sparkplug wire set was for a 1991 thunderbird SC with distributerless ignition. Amazon said it would fit my car. Sparkplug wires were for a car with a distributer which my supercoupe does not have. Amazon also charged me to return wires as they apparently thought I ordered the wrong part. Now I am worried about the other parts I ordered for my 1991 thunderbird SC that Amazon said would fit. Recommend not ordering auto parts from Amazon unless you know the exact part number you want. Amazon needs to get their act together if they are going to say yes it fits your car, because right now they don't."
3,Good but some glaring mistakes,"Not a bad book, I passed, but there are some glaring editing mistakes you will notice when you get to them- especially in the practice questions portion. Review your mistakes carefully- they may not be your mistakes."
2,"if you really have no clue, then this might be an elementary introduction","read this book in less than a day (purchased about 5 years ago) and just as i found then, this book is much too basic and general. you'd be better off researching via the web or speaking to expats or adults (that is, if you're a kid and already know you want to somehow work overseas). this is an over simplification of the ability to work overseas - lot of things that a job seeker should be aware of, like the complexity of obtaining work visas (which differ per country) and the kind of jobs that have a higher likelihood of eventually giving a person the chance to work overseas -- along with the corporate politics associated with all global organizations -- is either ignored or glossed over. as an experienced global professional, i would suggest the prospective buyer to refer to other sources. unless you are truly without access to the Internet at home or mentors who have international experience."
5,Las Vegas history: from mob to corporate,The complete saga of Las Vegas from its early roots with the mob to modern corporate times is presented in a lively history of the city's real rulers in SHARKS IN THE DESERT: THE FOUNDING FATHERS AND CURRENT KINGS OF LAS VEGAS. Many made their fortunes developing the casino business the city is most famous for today - but many myths have surrounded their activities - myths which columnist Smith dispels in an investigative history which tracked mobsters and their connections to the city's rich and monied.
3,Not bad... did have 1 break in about 2 weeks though!,They look cool and the price isn't bad but I question the durability. I had the nes controller on my keychain for a few weeks before one day I pulled my keys out of my pocket and the nes controller was no longer attached! :( I have no idea how it happened nor could I see a way to fix it. Good thing I have a Mario and a Link.
3,Looks really good but a bit uncomfortable,This shoe looks great but the backing is a little rough and unless you have thick socks its going to wear at your heals.
3,Good Bargain Shoes,"At Twenty-Four Ninety-five Shipped from Amazon, I bought 2 pair.The sizes run narrow. But I stretched by 13's out a little, and they are pretty comfy. Better wuality thatn eny Sub $50 shoe I have ever owned or worn.I would buy again in the future."
4,Comfortable and inexpensive dress shoe,"With my line of work I need a comfortable, yet durable pair of shoes. These oxfords are great around the relaxed setting in my office and also work great with a suit and/or pants & jacket. Best to break them in around your house first as blisters can form on the back of your heels. Having had my prior pair of dress shoes for a number of years I noticed a comfortable difference immediately. I would recommend these to anyone looking for comfort and style in the same shoe."
5,Life is more then a Blind Algorithmic Process,"Though Vertosick does not focus on the more technical and strictly academic foundations of his major thesis (life=intelligence), he does a beautiful job of using analogies and metaphors to describe how even a cell can exhibit ""intelligent"" behaviour. This book should be required reading for anyone who is remotely interested in biology, or anything to do with nature. Vertosick is able to successfully synthesize a completely different, yet strongly persuasive argument for the basis of life itself. He admits that his thesis may be flawed, but personally I think that most of his points are well thought out and strongly supported. This is one of the most interesting books on life and intelligence I have ever read."
3,Nice But Problematic,"I got because I thought it was a good idea to protect the screen and I thought the neck strap design would be useful. Trouble is you have to take it out of this case in order to download songs and charge the battery because it opens on bottom of the player. I didn't realize what a problem this would be until I actually used the thing.Might I suggest you get the belt clip leather case instead; it is made by the same company, also has a neck strap (as well as a belt clip and closing cover) and costs about the same amount. Both are designed to fit the Zen Vs (V Plus is the same size as V) but, the top opening design makes it so you never have to remove the player from the case."
4,gift for my daughter along with the mp3...great addition,"great product, my husband also has a version like this and he loves it"
1,Don't waste your money.,"One unit had a broken push-to-talk button upon receipt. Using the other unit to transmit, I found an effective range of approximately 5 blocks in a suburban environment. Forget the 5 MILE range claim unless you plan to use the unit strictly for line-of-sight transmissions. Belt clip is not hinged and can not easily be hooked/unhooked with one hand. Charging stand is very thin brittle plastic and would probably crack if trusted to the airlines in a suitcase. Radios have to be wiggled in the charger to make proper contact. I'm trying Motorola radios next. In this case, by going cheap it appears I got exactly what I paid for."
3,Material used,I like my bed ensemble but the material used is a little frail. I have contacted the seller and they are giving me 10% off what I paid. I was ironing my bed skirt and little rips would appear - like the material was old. It was the only one available so I decided to keep the ensemble. What I am afraid of is that the other side of the quilt is made of that material and that it may do the same thing.
3,Did not get it yet...,I still have't got this item I've purchased 2 mnths ago. can you help meBojan Dragicevic
1,DEFECTIVE,"This pre-seasoned skillet coating is coming off. I have attempted several times to season myself and the iron will not absorb the oil and/or bacon grease. The shipping cost to return this item is half the cost of the skillet due to it's weight, of course. Save your money DO NOT purchase!Loyal customer out of luck!"
5,Performs as described,Performed as promised. Great weight and balance. May need a couple of uses before it is truly seasoned. Be sure and follow directions on cleaning and storage.
1,Waste of money!,"This is a terrible product!First it came broken. When they ship the new one it never worked properly, and we're talking about a skillet here! Everything gets glued on it no matter how hard you try to ""cure"" the skillet. It's on the garbage now."
1,Cracked,"After having this skillet for only a few months, it suddenly cracked in the middle while I was cooking something. Looking at other reviews below, I don't seem to be the only who has had this happen. I don't know if this is common for all skillets, but I'd suggest thinking twice before ordering this product..."
5,Great for the beginner,"I bought this item during a Friday Sale on amazon for $10.99 as a gift for my son. He is just starting out on his own and enjoys cooking but hates standard no-stick (yeah, right!) teflon...who doesn't!! He has reported great non-stick success with this pan.I switched to all cast-iron fry pans several years ago and would never go back. The best pan in my collection is well over 50 years old, so cast iron pans are made to last. In fact, the more you use these the better they become. Of course, don't use plastic utensils with these. A good metal spatula turner will double as a scraper to help you clean this after use. Steel wool or heavy plastic scrubbies will finish clean up under hot water (no soap). I then put mine on a hot burner to evaporate the water and then apply a light layer of oil to the warm pan to keep it seasoned."
5,Great!,"This is a great skillet. I've cooked with woks, teflon skillets, and even stainless steel products before. But none of the above can retain heat as well as this skillet does.This skillet is also great if you want to sear your choice of meat and pop it into the oven to bake or broil. You can't do that with a teflon skillet or wok. Take this as a testimony of how versatile the cast iron skillet can be. This skillet is a definitely a must-have for anybody who loves to enjoy good food."
5,Great skillet!,"This skillet is a must have for those who need a pan with lots of surface space for even frying - the one drawback is that it is quite heavy (I need two hands to lift it!) but it is worth the extra effort to produce perfectly browned hash browns every time! The frying pan comes pre-seasoned, too!"
5,Is there a better pan?,"I used to think that my teflon or silverstone coated pans were the bomb for cooking most everything, including eggs.Somewhere along the way, I decided to go back to cast iron. One of the original reasons was that I could make sauces from what was left over in the skillet. The other was the fact that, after a couple uses cooking meats, this thing was even better than any of those so-called ""non-stick"" pans when I cooked eggs.Don't get me wrong; it doesn't do a great job with eggs out of the box. It takes a little time and use. I learned the hard way. The thing is, after you cook in this thing for a while, it gets so slick that eggs slide off of it like it's glass.The other thing I like about this one is that it's the perfect size for making cornbread. What other pan is there that you can use on the stove, in the oven, or over a camp-fire?"
2,Uneven Heating,"I use an electric range, and the pan never heats evenly. I like to use this pan for pancakes and pot stickers. My hope was that a heavy pan like this would heat evenly allowing me to cook multiple pancakes or a large number of pot stickers all at once. But no such luck. I've dealt with the pancakes by rotating them while cooking. But pot stickers are impossible with the middle ones getting burnt before the ones on the outside have any browning at all."
3,Good,"I learned how to use it, I treat it right, and it pays me back with the best performance and most delicious dishes ever,take the time to learn how to use and maintain it, and it will reward you."
2,sticky little pan,"I've used this pan to make a single egg (the reason I wanted something this small) and even though it is ""preseasoned"" I've always pammed it and preheated it and the eggs still stick to the bottom. Because it cannot be soaked it is hard to scrub out the egg. It cooked a small piece of salmon well enough, but again it was hard to get clean."
4,"Great pan, but too big for daily use","I have this pan and a 10"" version. I never use this (12"") pan. The 10"" is so much more manageable and practical. The 12"" only gets used on rare occasions when I need a really big pan. I didn't think the difference would be that significant, but it is. Many burners can't really even accommodate this large of a pan. If you're only looking for one cast iron pan, a 10"" is the way to go.As far as quality goes, there is no question. Fantastic pan."
5,The Perfect Skillet!!!!!!!!,"I love way that this skillet cooks. The width of this cast iron is perfect. Most 12 inch skillets are measured from rim to rim. This skillet is 12 inches base to base, thereby accommodating more food. The food cooks evenly and quickly. I highly recommend this skillet."
5,Perfect camp pan!!!,We have a lot of fish fries and we still prefer to pan fry over deep fry and this skillet is perfect! It fits on the outside fryer perfectly and cooks more fish at one time than our deep fryer. And the cast iron makes heat control a breeze! Have also used it for cooked cabbage and fried potatoes and onions! Perfect!!!
5,Highly Recommended!!!,"All I hoped for,as far as skillets go..Great value, should last about forever..Money well spent,and I am being careful with my cash right now..."
4,Fine cast iron skillet,"I have had this skillet for a long time. After having used this for so long, I have finally learned how to use it better.There are several different versions of how you season a cast iron skillet. I did not use a ""best practice"" before. And I wondered why food would stick to the skillet. . . I have checked out suggestions on the Internet and have come to know how to season this better. More recently, I have not had those same problems.I had moved away from cast iron skillets to nonstick skillets. My recent return to my 12 inch cast iron skillet has convinced me to use this as opposed to my nonsticks. I even purchased a cast iron Dutch Oven recently as a result of recent successes with this tool.So, a satisfied user. . . ."
3,pleased,I just bought the 12 inch skillet.very good quality.I dint cook with it yet because I saw a video on you tube about care of the pan.although it comes preseasoned the chief said we should rub ii with grape seed oil bake it for 45 min take it and wipe it with kosher salt.never use soap or water.could I get some info on this.thanks
1,MY ORDER WAS CANCELLED---Out of product forever,"The company selling this skillet is EWINS and they cancelled my order saying ""Thank you for your order, unfortunately we are completely sold out on this Lodge item and won't be getting any more into our warehouse."" Why is it advertised then?"
5,EASY CLEANUP!,"I am loving my cast iron. These comeper-seasoned making it a plus. I just washit as soon as it cools in hot water, dry it, andspray it with oil so its ready to go when neededkeeping it non-stick."
5,Great skillet,"Great skillet, great price. There's nothing not to love about this skillet. It seems practically indestructible. As long as we take care of it, I don't think we'll ever need to buy another one."
5,American Made,American Made. Truly of the highest quality. Very even cooking so far. Will get others to match. It does make a difference where your cast iron cookware comes from.
5,I am excited expecting it.(Lodge Logic L14SK3 Cast-Iron Skillet ),"I think 12"" which is actually 10"" is not big enough, therefore I bought this label 15"" actually 12"" Lodge Logic skillet, this is my first Cast-Iron fry pan. I am excited expecting it.I hope I can get my pan safe and sound.I will be back for the update, wish me luck!------Late update, on Friday morning, Taiwan time, It arrived! It's amazon fast! (It's amazing fast!)The packing is great! the 15"" skillet is great, I touch it for about 10 minutes and I love it.Now I need a cast iron recipe then I can cook my own dinner, lunch and yummy yummy breakfast~"
4,"Lodge 15"" Pan","A fine skillet, but the ""pre-seasoning"" is not nearly adequate. I am confident additional seasoning will solve the problem andthat the skillet will last indefinitely."
3,"Great pans EXCEPT for the 15"" skillet","I have the lodge Cast Iron Skillets at 6"", 8"", 10"", 12"", and 15"". All of these are fantastic EXCEPT the 15"" skillet which is not flat. The center of the pan buldges upwards like a hill and the oil trickles down to the sides of the pan. I have read that other reviewers have the same issue, but only with the 15"". It makes cooking an omelette quite the challenge."
5,Love it:),I would recommend Lodge cast iron wear to anyone. I have purchased many of their cook wear and have been nothing but pleased....
5,Great!,Great product! This product came exactly as explained and in a very short amount of time! Would Def. order through this company again
5,Better than expected.,"Bought this skillet & an 8"" to complement 2 large Lodge Logics fry pans that we're given to me at Christmas. They are a treat to use, heats quickly & evenly, easy to clean and maintain. They are exactly what I was after."
2,"decent looking item, poorly packaged","This item arrived at my house in a giant box with the handle poking through the cardboard on one end! I was able to return it without incident, but was somewhat concerned about receiving items for food preparation that weren't even wrapped in plastic or something similar. As it was, this pan would have been too large to work on my stove which has limited space between the stove and the wall. It's just too large for my regular-sized kitchen. I will be buying a smaller model and hoping that it's more effectively packed."
1,Damaged upon receipt,"The good news is that mine came broken right out of the box; the handle was broken completely off. I say this is good news because I had the box and packing materials right there, so return was simple.I still wanted a cast iron skillet, so I bought this same skillet locally for the same price. Great skillet, but it seems they don't ship well. Once you do get one, simply be sure to clean it with hot water and a stiff brush only (no soap), then dry it and oil it before putting it away."
5,I reseasoned the pan when it arrived.,"I did the inside and outside surfaces with lard and placed it in the oven upside down for 1 hour at 350 Deg. F., I only wash it in hot water when cleaning it and put in on the stove after drying it out, turn the burner on for 3 Min., apply peanut oil all around the indide of the pan and it's ready to use again with no rust forming."
3,not-exactly preseasoned,"I remember my mother's seasoned cast iron pans. These were not. Oh well, I know what I have to do and they're still better than teflon."
1,I have a question,"Recently I purchased a cast iron skillet and a pot; I used a couple of times and each time the food turned black, when I wash the skillet or pot the sponge turn black. I finally gave up and put both in the trash. I remembered as a child my grandmother always cooked with cast iron and you food was great.What did I do wrong?Thanks, Bill."
5,"Great quality, great price","I am very happy with this skillet. The other positive reviews are right on the mark. I've been very pleased with the quality, and love that it's pre-seasoned. It comes with care instructions and I just have no complaints!"
5,Great heavyweight pan,"Slow cook or quick sear, this pan is versatile. Perfect for camp fire cooking as well as in your kitchen. Pre-seasoned is, as usual, a good starting point. The only con is cleanup and maintaining the seasoning, but that's easy if you plan it in to meal prep. This is the brand to buy. I highly recommend purchasing the matching lid. You won't regret this purchase."
4,Great Cast Iron Skillet,"This is a great cast iron skillet for the price!!! I purchased it for the size as the one I have is too small if I am making more than 5 pork chops or chicken breasts. However, because its so big its really really heavy to pick up. I often brown my meat in the cast iron skillet on the stove top and then bake it in the oven and it is hard to lift it up to get it in the oven. Other than that this is the greatest skillet for the price. Cleans up really well and does what I need it to do!!!"
3,Not big enough,"The reason this item was deleted was due to the size. Nine inches is just not big enough. I would like at least ten inches, possibly larger."
1,Junk,These pans are junk compared to an old griswold or wagner ware. Just go on Etsy.com or even eBay and find yourself an old used cast iron pan. They are so much smoother and lighter.These pans are heavy pieces of crap with awful bumpy steel lining.
2,i love Lodge cast iron,"i love Lodge cast iron, this pre-seasoned monster's surface is terrific.and i knew what i was getting when i ordered this pan, but it's so large as to be nearly impractical for home use, at least on a stove-top.on my single burner, even with significant low and steady preheating, a hot spot is created in the center of the pan. the edges of the pan were not as hot.maybe if you have a french-top or another large multiple-burner range top (or even a campfire?) it might work better.instead, i'll use the pan for baked oven dishes-- where the pan can be evenly heated.the pan itself is sturdy as heck and of course, it's incredibly heavy. definitely a two-hander.it's made well and the pre-seasoned surface is without flaws."
4,bjane[NQ],Love the extra handle for easier lifting of the skillet. Wish the surface was a little smoother. This size about completes my set of cast-iron skillets and pans. Thinking abouit purchasing the 11-inch Logic deep fryer skillet. Also looking for 1-quart sauce pan. Love cast-iron; long lasting and easy to take care of. Soap is not necessary.
4,Just what i expected,"Lodge is no doubt the leader in cast iron cookware. This is a fine little fry pan. I am using it in my fish smoker to cook the wood pellets...perfect for that, maybe the 8"" would have been slightly better."
1,not a fan,i can't wash it in the dishwasher. it rusts if left wet or unused.. to much work for me. i threw it out once it rusted. too bad.
4,Civil War and Quilting--What's Not to Like?,"I just finished reading Alice's Tulips last night, and of the four Sandra Dallas books I've read, this was far and above my favorite. The characters spoke to me more than those in the other three novels. Two of my passions are quilting and studying the Civil War, and Alice's letters and the chapter introductions were filled with references to both. I'm purchasing a copy of Alice's Tulips to send to a friend in Fresno who is another Civil War buff. I think she will enjoy the Civil War connection, and the quilting references will help her understand me better."
5,"Marvelous, well-written story","Alice's Tulips was not the first book I've read by Sandra Dallas, but it is definitely my favorite. The book is a series of letters, most of them from one sister to another, who are separated when the younger sister marries and moves to an isolated farm in Iowa. The younger sister, only 16, writes the sort of callow, self-centered and judgemental letters that only a sheltered 16-year-old could write, but she has a kind heart and a good brain, and it is a true joy to watch her learn the sometimes painful lessons of adulthood, especially in the trying times of the Civil War. The characters were all so real, so well-defined and true that it was almost impossible not to think of them as real people, and to think about them long after I completed the book.I recommend this book for quilters, for readers of women's fiction, and for anyone who enjoys Oprah's picks but who also likes a novel that ends on a positive note."
3,Probably wouldn't buy these again,The forks are worthless because they don't stick the food. The spoons aren't as nice as the longer ones byt the same brand. These are pretty short in length and fatter so they don't work in smaller top containers like yogurt very well. Next time I'll get the longer thinner take & toss spoons. Price here is decent though.
4,Good travel spoons/forks,My little one has yet to master feeding himself with utensils but we bring these along to feed him when we're out of the house. He also like to hold them while he eats. The forks work ok when I'm the one who's spearing the food but I don't know how well they work if he were to do it himself. I like how the back of the handles are curved/hollow so that they lay flat against each other - perfect for traveling. At first I thought it would be uncomfortable to use because of this but they aren't.
3,Good ideas,"I like this book because it gave me some good ideas. I wasn't overwhelmingly impressed and didn't feel it was a great value, which is why I only gave it 3 stars. But the ideas are clever and I will probably use them all."
4,Card Making,"Card making is such an individual creative process. These are fantastic ideas to copy or expand upon for making cards to share for holidays, birthdays and other card-occasions. A beautifully illustrated book to keep on the shelf for reference."
3,Unauthorized copy or factory second?,My book is excellent quality except that there is no printing on the outside binding as there is on my Eastern Region book. This makes me wonder if I bought an unauthorized copy or a factory second.Too costly to send back but maybe I will buy books from a book store in the future.
5,easy to clean!!,"My daughter bought me this for Christmas! I made a chocolate cake in it, and it turned out beautiful! And it was super easy to clean!! Lovely gift for anyone who bakes."
2,Cake always stick,"I own this pan and the Bavarian and Chrysanthemum models too. I think Nordicware makes very innovative designs which makes their flaw even more disappointing. After a few uses, everytime I bake with these pans the cake always stick. I grease AND flour these pans before baking and the cake still sticks. One reviewer said to LIBERALLY grease these pans, but I don't understand why there's so much work for greasing a ""non-stick"" pan. I had less worries when using a regular tin pan with no ""non-stick""."
5,Please buy this cd,This is a really incredible album. It's 15 songs long and they are all great. I am a Buffalo Tom fan but didn't know that Bill Janovitz had another project. This is a perfect record in my opinion. I can't overstate how much I recommend it.
5,JLT Fans will love this album,I think JLT made these classics better than the original artists.This is one of my favorite Classic Rock albums.Joe's demonstrates he has the vocals to match the best.And the guitar leads are exellent.What are you waiting for buy this album a must have.This is Kick Butt Classic Rock at its very best..
2,DSL for Dummies,"The author was struggling to fill an entire book with information. The pertinent stuff could have been condensed into an article. Besides information about high speed Internet access changes daily.Even though some of the information is interesting and presented in the ""amusing Dummies format,"" if you are considering increasing your bandwidth your time will be better spent in magazines or on the web itself."
4,Look's even better in person!,"This product looks even better in person, and is such a great accessory. Although I must say I would have preferred it to be bigger."
3,"Good product, but there are definetly better ones for the same price.","This product was bought for my wife, her feedback is that it does the job, but not as efficient as other ones in the same price range."
4,"Good, but could be better","Don't get me wrong, this dvd is great, but if it had the music video for ""Hold On"" and some concert footage, it would be better. The dvd has all the videos up to ""Hold On."" Even though it doesn't feature the concerts, the video for the ""Festival Song"" was taped at a concert. But overall the Good Charlotte dvd has excellent commentaries on the videos."
5,A Note of Martone on the Horizon,"A son is born too early, as if coming up over the horizon before his own dawn. An elderly father lingers at life's other horizon. In language dense and clear, playful and somber, and with a formal exactitude and emotional amplitude suggestive of his own musical training, Martone traverses these horizons with a musician's as well as a poet's ear."
3,Colbert and script shine in snappy comedy.,"A star turn for Claudette Colbert in an very amusing and well-written comedy. Happily married woman tricked into posing as the wife of her husband's best friend - but the press get ahold of the story and her life and marriage are compromised. Amusing and adult script and marvelous Colbert make this a brisk, breezy and enjoyable film - superbly remastered. Oscar nom for Original Score."
1,This phone sucks!!,I live in a loft across from train and commuter train tracks in a semi-industrial area. The phone has worse range than the 900 I had -- about 20 feet from my door. I have an outdoor entrance. The reception also sucks. Don't buy it. I should have tested it more thoroughly.
5,50 Questions and answers for children from Kosova,"For longer than one year I've been seeking answers that will be given to the future generations, particularly children of Kosova, about the wars that were continually going on in that troubled region of Balkans. As a refugee survivor of the latest crises in Kosova , I was invited in many American classrooms to answer the questions of the American children about the biggest refugee exodus after World War II. ""What is War? What is Peace?"" written by Richard Rabinowitz, is an inspiring book. This book answers in a very creative and constructive way many war related questions. The ability to simplify the big truths and make lessons for our children is actually part of the process of recruiting peace ambassadors for the future."
1,Don't waste your money,"My friend bought me this USB drive for my birthday, and he got himself one as well. Both of ours broke just few months later. Files added to the drive all become corrupted when transfering between computers. And the worst part is I didn't even use it very often."
1,Crap - Ruined it in Vista,"I used this ONCE in Vista and it seemed to work fine. Then plugged it in the second time and it stated that multiple drive letters were being used and that it detected multiple devices. So, I downloaded the update files from Sandisk and it WIPED the entire drive and turned it into a 1MB flash drive.I am a computer genius (I'm not flaunting that) and I tried everything from U3 hacks, separate ISO's etc. etc. (read up on that if you wish) and nothing worked.It's going back.Not compatible with Vista? sheesh...catch up Sandisk"
3,Good At First - Then Failed After One Month,"At first I was extremely thrilled with this product - great storage capacity, ease of use and transport.Downfall was that it failed after one month and ""can't start"" on any computer. The orange light flashes constantly for about 2 minutes - it's trying to start, then dies. Customer support tells me not a thing they can do - you are supposed to use the U3 program to eject the drive to prevent problems. Problem was caused by a power failure. While using my computer, the power went out town wide and my computer shut down (of course), therefore the SanDisk assumed that it was ejected incorrectly and failed. Bad design flaw I believe.So, if you want to use this one - make sure all computers have a battery back-up to allow you to ""correctly"" eject the SanDisk!"
2,Not a good Company to Deal with,I ordered two 4 gb mini flash drives. One of them arrived DOA (dead on arrival. I have emailed the person who sold this product with no response.I would say that the seller does not warranty any equipment. If you bought it you own it. Not the way I like to do business.
5,My eyes have been opened. Your's will be too.,"This awesome and dynamic book will open your eyes to what it really means to be a ""Christian."" I was so awestruck that I could not put the book down. If you are looking for meat you will find it here but be prepared to be shaken from your old thought patterns. You will not be the same again."
4,Another Great Naruto Movie,Just saw this on Cartoon Network this past weekend. I'm a major Naruto fan - with three pre-teen fans at home - and this was a great movie. Just wish they'd lose the shorter sleeves...! :-)
4,Saved time and money,Saved time and money as a local auto parts store would have to special order it anyway probably charge more and you would have to make atleast to trips to get it.
1,Actors = Bad Musicians,"Thomas Ian Nicholas may be famous with his American Pie movies, but I guarentee with this horrible album, The T.I.N. Men will never be ""Rookie of the Year""."
1,If you want to vomit,"This is the gayest album I have ever heard. When I listen to this music I feel a bit insulted, How dare they call this a music CD. CAUTION IF YOU HAVE A WEAK STOMACH DO NOT LISTEN TO THIS CD!"
4,Great Product,"I was quite impressed with the sound quality and ease of use of these headphones. I have enjoyed them for over 2 months now with no complaints. The y charge quickly and last a long time. There is an audio signal which tells you when the phones are one and again when they connect with the base. This is a nice touch as you can put them on, press and hold the power button and know when everything is ready without haveing to verify before you put on the headset. I felt this was a great touch to the product. An extra that made me like it even more. The adapters for the ipod's are a nice touch. For the price I couldn't have asked for a better product."
1,Logitech Wireless Headphone,"Some weeks ago I have bought the wireless headphone and it shows already problems with the Bluetooth System. The Akku's have also a very short lifetime. I will send it back to Amazon to get my money back or to get a new headphone. I have even made a major mistake and I have bought two of these haedphones and the second one shows also the same problemsLogitech, Inc. Mobile Traveller Bluetooth Headset"
2,"Great sound, painful fit","I picked these up locally, having wanted a set of wireless headphones for my office.- Sounds great. I start to get choppiness about 50 feet away from the base, but that's plenty for me, I really just want them for the 6 feet in my cube!.- Battery life is OK, not great. Lasts maybe 4 hours of continuous play, which isn't long enough for me.- Fit is horrible. My ears ache after wearing them for 15 minutes. They don't sit on my ears right, constantly having to fiddle with them and adjust them.I would not buy these headphones again and would not recommend you do so."
4,"Good, but not for recording use.","I had intended to use these as part of a home recording studio setup -- not having wires in the way as I played guitar with headphones on sounded like a great idea!Sadly, that doesn't work. It turns out that the sound that comes out of the earpieces is delayed, by as much as half a second. So if you're trying to hear yourself as you play, you'll find what you hear isn't what you're playing, but rather what you played half a second ago. Which is rubbish for recording.Otherwise, they're great, ideal for walking around with your ipod, etc. Still glad I got these ... lack of wires makes a surprising difference, the sound is okay, and they're comfortable and unobtrusive. Recommended for listening to music, but not for making it!"
4,Logitech FreePulse Headphones,"The wireless aspect is good and the headphones have good sound quality but they become very uncomfortable when wearing for more than about thirty minutes. The construction is solid and definitely much better than the less expensive model with the plastic band support that easily breaks. The controls (volume, on/off and base) are simple and straight forward. The duration time of the built-in batteries seems to vary depending on time in between uses.Overall these are good headphones and definitely better than the hassles of having wires to deal with. Maybe Logitech can get the comfort value figured out for the next model."
2,Mistress of Seduction only O.K.,"THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU SHOULD NOTE: The two girls featured on the cover of this video ARE NOT IN THE MOVIE!The story is somewhat interesting. Some attractive girls. A few okay non-explicit sex scenes. Most of the actresses get topless. Not much more.DVD EXTRAS: The same previews from all Seduction Cinema releases. Also, clips from auditions were interesting but nothing of the ""casting couch"" sort. Outtakes included multiple takes of a male actor attempting to take off an actresses bra. Yawn.PROS: Looks like they actually had a script. Cute naked girls.CONS: Looks like they actually had a script."
5,It is cool!,"This movie would have been so much better, had they left out the cheesy lesbian stuff. I know almost everyone in the film, and the plot is good, but they really ruined it with the lesbians."
3,Peg It Therapeutic Tool,"Though it was clear in the online description, I was very disappointed to receive 2 boards, but only enough pegs to fill one board. It is greatly over-priced for the quality of the product, which is inexpensive plastic and not very sturdy while using it. The seller should at least provide a 2nd set of pegs. I'm not returning this because I need it for physical therapy to regain my motor skills after a serious injury."
3,"Go for the Original, Not This","The original is a neat classic. This is a modern re-make (new drawings, ""corrected"" for a more modern audience), and strays from the quality of the original.To it's credit, it has a copy of the original tacked on as an appendage.Skip this version, and just get the original, and you'll have all you need, for less money."
5,There has got to be more,"I now have season 1 and season 2, and love them both. I can remember episodes that are not included on these 2 DVDs so there must be at least one more coming. I hope it's soon."
4,Semi-Homemade is delicious,"I bought this book and don't regret it. The paper is high quality and the photos are beautiful. I have tried some of the recipes and all have been a hit every time. Sure the list of ingredients for each recipe includes some brand name item(s) or pre-prepared food. But that is what ""semi"" homemade is all about. Part pre-packaged/store bought and part made from scratch. A great combination if you will try the recipes. I don't save scads of time by using these recipes but they do make delicious dishes which are different from most other dishes you will see and have all been a hit at any party I have taken them and with my family at home."
5,Fabulous,"I am certainly going to make some of these desserts as they look so simple to make. I rank it up there with ""The Cake Doctor"". Also the shipping time was fantastically fast."
1,Run! Don't Walk away from this book,"Amazon really needs to let you give a negative rating. I've seen the ""author"" on Food Network and was amazed at what a horrible show she has. When I saw her book I had to check it out. It's just as bad. If you really don't have time to cook do yourself and your family a favor and find a good local bakery, or at least choose Sara Lee over Sandra Lee.P.S. If you think that Katie Couric really does her own cooking I have a some beachfront property in Oklahoma I'd love to sell you."
2,globes crack from heat,"i was asleep and heard a huge crashing noise, waking me up.upon investigation, i looked in the bath area and the glass globe had separated from its neck and sailed into the sink, scattering glass all around.these things run very hot and i am surmising that the intense heat caused the globe to split and fail.the vendor was very helpful and said that a replacement globe would be sent by kirschler.i,ll keep y,all posted.thanks.PS: Kichler sent a replacement globe immediately.Also: I have since drilled a small vent hole in the steel canopy to tryand relieve some of the heat gain."
2,Be careful on where you're buying it from...,"Looked good, physically, until I opened the book. Writing inside and missing pages (ripped off), as I continued to look through the book (p. 141-148). Otherwise, the material is great. I wonder what was on the missing pages??"
4,like wearing flip-flops with a cocktail dress...,"This is an elegant little unit with many attractive features. However, the headsets supplied with this phone give low quality sound and are awkward and unpleasant to use. I substituted the earbud I usually use with my cellphone and the sound quality was much more acceptable. At this price, I would expect decent headsets to be included."
1,Slow Read,I thought this would be the evolution of marriage and maybe a true history of how it came about. It's basically a lot of uninteresting banter that doesn't flow at all.
5,Clark comes back on a mission,"This is the CD that is going to make Terri Clark a household name. She has some well-written songs and teamed up once again with producer Keith Stegall and added Nashville hit-maker Byron Gallimore (Tim McGraw, Faith Hill, Jo Dee Messina). The result is a CD that kicks!There are a lot of great, uptempo songs like the first single ""I Just Wanna Be Mad"", ""Pain to Kill"" and ""I Wanna Do it All"". My favorite songs on the CD are ""Three Mississippi"", which has a kind of cool Zydeco vibe to it with the accordion, and ""God and Me"", a mellow song about Terri's relationship with Him. Definitely single material is ""I Just Called to Say Goodbye"" about moving on and rubbing it in his face a little.Pain to Kill is Terri's highest debuting album on the charts and I think that is a sign of the BIG things that are going to come from this album! Buy it, you'll love it!"
2,Can't keep kneepads on my knees,"I've tried to use these kneepads for washing floors and weeding gardens. However if I stand up or even attempt to crawl forward, the kneepads slip. I'm soon wearing them down around my calves.It doesn't matter how much I tighten the two straps, the kneepads won't stay in the proper position. The only thing I haven't tried is sewing them to an old pair of jeans. Even if I did that, the kneepads are so heavy, they'd probably pull the jeans down.Lord help a really slender person who tries to wear this product."
2,Too Slow,"I've used two brands of USB Flash drives, Lexar JumpDrive and Cruzer Mini. Of the Lexar brand I've used both Usb 1.1 and Usb 2 drives, and I have to say that the Cruzer Drive is closer in speed to USB 1.1 than the stated USB 2. Of course, this is in relation to transfers of a large number of small files. The Cruzer Mini can handle large files fairly well. (Although, it is still slower.)For example:-------------JumpDrive 2.0 Pro.....Cruzer Mini 2.0...Lexar JD 1.11 71.7GB file......7-8 sec............16-18 sec...........199 sec28MB 916 files....96 sec..............470 sec.............555 sec(Note, these are write speeds)The numbers speak for themselves. The Cruzer drives are clearly closer old USB 1.1 speeds than USB 2. They're nice and cheap, but if you want performance, I'd suggest something else."
4,demonstrates versatility of pastels and techniques,"I really am glad that I have this book. I am a beginner pastelists. This book covers a lot of material on pastels, from paper selection to pastel types, etc. The examples are not as useful for me at this point, but would probably be of more use to an advanced artist. Yet the book is still good for beginners also because it covers several different topics and techniques on pastels."
1,Don't buy this....I rate this 0 stars.,I just bought this phone on Sunday and with plenty of time to charge up. Hello...major static on the phone. Reception stunk. I am taking this phone back tomorrow.
3,Not Impressed,I purchased the phone and I wasnt too thrilled with the look of it. When I looked at other phones out there it seemed OK. The phone is a little hard to use and figure out. It doesnt seem to be very clear and also has ok range.I wasnt happy with the price I paid for it. I am going to return it.By the way - I e-mailed Uniden and no response - horrible customer service
5,The best cordless phone I've ever owned!,"I looked at a lot of cordless phones before I found this one. It is the best design and color combination (silver/black) I've seen. It feels and looks like a big cell phone, with no annoying antenna. The reception is great. All the features work great. I love the speaker phone on the handset. You can't beat all the features, plus the extra handset and charger that's included. Get it now while you can!"
3,disappointed,"my fiance and I have both had uniden 900 megahertz for almost a decade. When we met, we both had the same phone and continued to use them for five more years! I loved uniden, so I was really excited when this new cool looking phone came out. we waited for the price to drop somewhat and finally bought it. Well, I'm not so impressed. the main thing is that it cuts out or breaks up when i'm in my office. Every phone conversation I have to walk into the living room b/c it gets somewhat better reception out there. it's worse than my cell phone by far. i don't really use the fancy features. answering machine works well, it's very modern looking, but i'm upset every time I have to move around the house to get good reception. I think there have to be better phones out there, esp for the $$$$."
2,"Great interviews, but poor fact checking","This documentary has some excellent interviews with the actual Navajo code talkers. However, the narration that accompanies the interviews is full of basic factual errors (e.g., the ancestors of the Navajo were not the Anasazi; Philip Johnston did not, by his own account, get the idea of using code talkers from the World War I Choctaw or Comanche; the U.S. military did not create increasingly complex codes in response to an elite group of English-speaking Japanese code breakers; the code was not kept top secret for 20 years (it was featured in a movie in the 1950s), etc.). Enjoy listening to the stories told by the Navajo, but take everything else with a huge grain of salt."
4,Back to the Big band,"Seeing that I have all three of his BB discs and really enjoyed him from the first one.When I bought the second one I couldn't stop listening to it because it was so energeticsounding and well done. I finally got around to getting this one and listened to it a coupletimes, but it just didn't hit me like the second disc. I like it, but I don't think it's as good as eitherof the first two.I guess I'll have to listen to it a few more times and possibly update my review."
3,good childhood memories,this was a good movie for many children i loved watching it as a child and now my children can enjoy watching it as well
1,no good,"i ordered this item hoping to add another audio documenatry to my collection. i can't say this cd sux because there is no cd! all i got was the outer cardboard case and a crappy metal tin that was EMPTY. no cd here. i dunno if thats really what i ordered or i got ripped off but this just goes to show, while there are many quality unofficial items out there, buy them at your own risk because trent hasn't approved any of them."
2,Short,I am pretty disappointed by how short this book is. What is there is nice but not enough to justify buying it.
3,A decent video,"As with most Just Planes videos, this one is quite entertaining for the aviation enthusiast. It is also nice seeing an Airbus cockpit up close. Unfortunately, the sound quality of the video isn't the best - I had to turn up my volume quite high during some of the segments when the pilots told about the plane, only to have my ears blown out when the next segment started! Other than that though, the video is quite nice. The night flights are exceptionally beautiful."
2,Pool cover was very thin,When we first opened up the box and opened up the pool cover we couldn't believe how thin it was. Because we the leaves are falling and the pool is ready to be closed we put it on the pool. We will wait the winter to see if it holds up. I am very skeptical that it will stay in one piece through our windy Wisconsin winter.
1,Very difficult to understand,"The author has good mathematics, but not the abilities to explain something clearly to a student or a beginner. I need to buy another book."
3,Too soft,"I like that this tooth brush has soft brushes from all angles. I also like that the head is soft; however, I do not like that the handle is too soft. It bends easily, so it is hard to brush my one year old's teeth. He has only four front teeth, so now it works, but if he had more teeth, it wouldn't work as well."
5,Great diaper change distractor,My 9 month old is at the stage where he wants to constantly roll away from diaper changes. What better way to teach him to brush his teeth multiple times a day than at a time when I need him to be still. I just give him his tooth brush and let him brush away while I change his diaper. Success!
4,my baby loves it,"My baby love this little thing, it is small enough for her to grab. She is not really using it to brush her teeth but use to chew on it, makes her feel better while teething. She loves it so i love it!!!"
5,Baby loves using it!,"Soft bristlesBaby loves to ""do it all by myself""Loves that it will cover all surfaces, even when brushing for a few seconds.I recommend getting different kind of toothbrushes. Like toys, baby gets easily bored."
1,Baby Did Not Like This One At All,"I had high hopes for this product after reading through all the reviews. I excitedly opened and washed it as soon as it arrived, with excited anticipation that this would be THE toothbrush my 1-year old would love. But alas, it was a big fat failure. My daughter barely even gave it a second look. She held it for a second and soon dropped it on the floor. My husband tried it with her again later on and it still didn't work. I'm not sure if it's because it's intended for younger babies or not but either way, it's now just sitting there hardly touched or even noticed.Go for the banana toothbrush instead. I received both on the same day and our daughter absolutely loved that one. It has made brushing much easier."
4,"It's fine, but do you really need it?","After I read all the reviews on amazon, I decided to buy this training toothbrush for my then 7 month old, who was just getting a few teeth. He didn't like it much as a teether. It was too floppy for me to use to brush his teeth.A few months later, I bought a regular toothbrush at a grocery store- ""My first toothbrush"" made by Colgate, that was $2.49. Basically a small, short-handled, soft toothbrush, that was aged 0-2 years. We started brushing his teeth at bedtime, and he loved that he got to use a brush just like ours. I think ""training"" toothbrushes are basically an unnecessary product, as even a young child can tolerate having a real toothbrush as long as they have supervision, and may like using that as a teether as well. And you can probably find it in your local grocery, so why pay more for shipping?"
4,Useful information,"The book has very practical information on the functions of a notary. There's also detail on the legal background. There's a lot that I never realized about what notaries can/can't do, nor did I know the details behind the proper procedures a notary should follow. Good stuff."
2,Very disappointed.,"I expected the product to offer more support than it actually did; it doesn't offer much at all. Also, I can't unclasp this bra with one hand for nothing; it's impossible. Not to mention when you unclasp it, it doesn't do a very good job of staying under your breast while your feeding. You can't wear nursing pads with these bras because they are see through; even through some shirts. I bought a 42DDD and it fits my breasts good, but it's tight around my back so I had to buy extenders for it. I also bought a 46DDD and it fits much better, but still not what I expected. They also ride high on my back. I'm very disappointed with these bras; I just don't have the money to spend another $60 on more so I'm stuck with them. Do yourself a favor and spend a little more on a bra that works a little better. I read so many reviews on bras and really thought I had picked out winners; I was wrong. :("
2,1992? Good resource. 2010? Not so much.,"Note the date of publication - 1992. As such suspension, now not only commonplace but integral to modern techniques of mountain biking, is not discussed. Some of the finer and basic points such as body and pedal position, weight transfer, climbing and crash survival still apply but the more complicated techniques do not. Also, though the illustrations are good at conveying subject matter, the entire text of the book is handwritten script, is incessant with the groin jokes, and features a bit of profanity. At the end of the day, it's cheap, a quick read, and has some good basic pointers, but it's outdated and strives a bit too much to be a comic strip."
2,Slick looking but lacking in performance,"I purchased this phone but returned it. My initial reaction was to the sound quality. When comparing this item to my Panasonic 2 line 900 mhz spread spectrum phone, I noticed that the sound quality was noticeably worse.My second reaction was to the inability to use both handsets simultaneously. I feel that if a cordless system has two handsets, they should both be able to talk on one line at the same time. Plus, there is no feature to transfer the address book from one phone to another.Overall, this phone is very slick looking, and might work for someone who is satisfied with only 10 minutes of answering machine recording time and doesn't mind mediocre sound quality. I find that the older 900 mhz DSS panasonic phones offer much higher sound quality and extended range in comparison to this phone."
4,just outstanding,"A very good book, it made me realize that having an education should always come first. This book obviously moved me. I loved it and I recommend it to all you Tiger Woods fans out there. It is a good book because it tells you the whole story from when he was born, to the skins game in which he participated in."
2,Should have been called resitation of quotes,"Although I found this book decent reading, it was to heavily dependant on reprinting quotes that Tiger had already said throughout his young career. At points it seemed that the author had an ax to grind, in the way situations were presented."
1,Don't be fooled.,"McLaren may write what a lot of your ears are itching to hear but he does not write truth. He seeks to take the foundation of God's Word and replace it with sifting sand. There will be nothing of McLaren's that stands when the rain comes. He twists Scripture and misinterprets it to say what he is trying to say. I challenge you, if you do read it. Read it with God's Word right next to you and find out for yourself. McLaren is a product of our culture and of post-modernism, not a product of the absolute and infallible Word of God."
4,A New Kind of Christian [Book],"It was so refreshing to read a book by a Christian author that was not a ""5 steps to _______."" In fact, I don't think this book offered any answers - just questions. I think what I liked the most about this book is that the author himself doesn't necessarily agree with everything he wrote. But he found it important to include certain ideas to cause us, the readers, to think. I found it very challenging and refreshing. Definitely worth a read!"
2,Not as good as it could have been.,"The thing that sucks about this DVD is how it's cut, I mean it will cut off right in the middle of the song. It gets really annoying...but it does have the videos of ""Breakdown"" and ""The Roof"" 2 of Mariah's best videos."
1,big disappointment!,"1.As a Mimi fan, this DVD show bad perfomences of her (with Olivia NJ very bad video) its obvious she has much better perfomences aruond the world.2.the vidios are cut in the muddle3.some vidios are changed in the middle to another performences - how can i enjoy half a show?? its wired and dissaponting to see that.4.I saw much better performences on internet sites and I am sad to waist 13$ on a bad DVD like this one.5.I also orderd Medison Squere Garden DVD and he was amazing! so I have a way to compere between a good DVD and a bad one."
1,could have been better,"This DVD lacks a lot and in some ways needs more improvement. There is not the right combo of songs -- I wish there was ""Without You"" on this DVD. It looks like Mariah is trying very hard to copy Madonna."

3,Could be better,"Mariah is great, and she's one of my favorite singers.Although I'm a 70's music fanatic, but I admire her style.The DVD shows Mariah on different concerts around the world. It could be a great selection, but the video cuts make it below average rate. The sound is good, and well divided using a dolby 5.1 system, and the picture is also good. The bonus video clips are excellent. I think her DVD #1 is a better purchase."
1,Poorly made,It broke the star from the piece that holds the string after only 24 hours. It arrived on time and looked very nice but the total quality was weak and soft so it would not hold up to wear.
2,Disappointed,This picture makes it look better than what it looks in person. Its darker (I guess antiquing is what its suppose to be?) Definitely for A man.
1,Piece of Crap,"This is the most complicated piece of crap I've ever owned. Not only is it the least user friendly thing I've ever owned (and I'm no techno dummy), the hard drive has failed since day one. I had to reset by unplugging and plugging back in after 30 seconds. Sad part is I wouldn't realize the hard drive failed until after I realized my program didn't record. This happened probably 8 of ten times we recorded a program. We spent hours setting this up, trying to upload programming information, then spent literally HOURS on the phone with tech support only to find out that the unit was faulty and the warranty expired (only 6 mos). Now the DVD won't work at all. This unit isn't even 2 yrs old. Total junk."
5,"works well, nice product","I have enjoyed this product a lot, its made my life much easier. I don't feel like I am a slave to the networks now, and I can skip commercials. I can write to DVD's easily it seems to have advanced editing, but I haven't figured all that out yet. It does take a bit to get use to, if all you have ever had is a VCR, but the manual is well written and its easy to figure out, just takes some practice. It seems to be compatible with most cable or antenna systems and I love the TV guide on it, much easier than the cable TV guide."
1,The TV Guide On Screen function ruins this product,"I was very eager to own this DVR product. Everything seemed to set up okay until I got to the programming of the TV Guide On Screen. I have had this unit for over a month and I still cannot completely download the program listings through my Motorola cable box. I have called Toshiba many times and have yet to resolve the issue. I was promised a call from their technicians specializing in this service last Fridays and I waited all day with no contact. I am probably going to be returning this product for a refund, as I do not wish to deal with the company again.As far as I'm concerned, I will never buy this brand again."
1,Dreadful engine noise,Generates horrible screaming engine noise. Not recommended for audio applications such as portable cassette players.
4,"Works well with exceptional clarity, nice features...","First off, the looks of this phone are very attractive, and that is what lured me to it in the first place. After I bought it, it was charging and I read some good and bad reviews about it, and had my reservations. Well, this phone has very good clarity and sound, with the speakerphone just a bit on touchy side, but for being in a handset I cannot complain. Had an hour long converstation on the speakerphone toady and did not have any problems except some low sound at times, but that is somewhat normal. I give it 4 stars because the range is not what you would think, if you DID NOT know any better. There are so many different variables as to why or why not this phone will work great/bad for you it's insane. So, buy it, try it, and if you don't like it; TAKE IT BACK."
1,One time's a lemon. Three times is a bad design.,"I bought this unit to replace a beautiful but dying Siemens expandable phone system. While most of the features work as advertised, my big complaint is with the handsets not answering an incoming call when you pick them up. I may be overly critical, but this is a function I generally expect from my telephones, especially ones costing this much. This inability to connect with an incoming signal has been a reoccuring problem with the first system and two replacement ones. We also get quite a bit of static that I suspect is interference with my wireless network even though the 5.8 ghz technology is suppose to avoid this problemWe also have a problem with people calling and getting a fax signal even though we don't have a fax machine. This is probably a phone company problem but at this point I'm not willing to give Uniden the benefit of the doubt.I'll be returning this system and trying the Vtech i5871."
4,works as advertized,Way better quality than I expected for the price - classic. Comes in so many shades you've got to be able to find one that goes with your guitar and looks like it's been there for years.
5,great Bat,I love this bat hard to find no longer made great pop for a bat that is legal in almost any legue.
5,It works as promised in the ad.,It works !Adopted an 18 month old dog who had been running freely since birth. Tried obedience training and choker collar with limited results. Change was immediate and walking on leash is now enjoyable.Instructions are clear and if followed get the promised effect.telling everyone I know who has had similar dog-walking challenges.
1,Lifespan of a fly,"I can only get 11-12 color prints from these cartridges on HP Advanced Photo paper. They are small for a color cartridge, which explains everything. Canon sucks, i'm going back to Epson or HP"
2,Canon CL-31 Color Ink Cartridge (1900B002),I buy this catridge pg30 and cl 31 for my pixma mp210 but it is not compatible with my pixma mp210it maybe works with other printers but not mp210 series
5,Toner,"Good price..I was a first time buyer, now I will always order on-line.Ordered on 9/29--it read that I would receive between 10/5 to 10/9. Order came on 10/5."
2,You May Receive a Different Product,"I ordered these expecting them to be ""Koss Artist Chalk"" as advertise, however I received another cheaper brand chalk. So beware who you purchase these from.I ordered through DEDC, so I would not recommend ordering through them.I love my Koss artist chalk (see my review on them), however I did not receive Koss chalk on this order.So, Koss chalk is good however, be cautious of your vendor."
2,Hair chalk - no,"Very difficult to use without making a huge mess. Completely dries out my hair. Very hard to apply without using water. But if used for art, they work very well and are nice!"
5,A must have for bead lovers,"A beautifully done & informative book. I've enjoyed all of Jargstorf's books & feel they are an important contribution in an area where so few substantive works are available. This holds even more true with regards to beads of Bohemian origin...If you are interested in beads in general, it's recommended; beads of bohemian & czech origin, it's essential reading."
2,Where is the romance???,"Very flat and dull, extremely disappointing. I had been given this book and told to read anything by Jane Feather, that it would be excellent. Well, it was average at best.I liked the history and the setting, though the author really does need to do a better job of capturing life in Renaissance England. The characters were wooden and predictable, the book plot-driven only.As for sizzle and sensuality, more like fizzle and not even foreplay!The hero tries valiantly to like her, but Pen is not a nice person a lot of the time. The trust between them hardly builds enough to convince us they are falling in love, and the ending of the novel really falls completely flat.I know it is supposed to be part of a series, but I am most definitely not swept away by this novel enough to care about Lady Pen, let alone the first or the next book."
2,marketing book,"An okay book maybe for someone starting out or just investigating the publishing industry. However, it is outdated and does not give a comprehensive perspective as the market is changing rapidly and drastically."
4,Allies In Healing,Very good book for partners or spouses of those that were abused as a child. The first step is getting them to admit the problem and let you help. This can be very difficult and frustrating by itself. Lots of good ideas.
4,Updated reviews,"I am a survivor who is also an ally in healing. This book is quite good in helping you to help others. It is written by one of the authors of Courage in Healing.If you love someone who has been abused sexually as a child, this is a good place to start. If you are a spouse, lover, partner to a survivor of abuse, this book will help to answer some of the questions you have.For instance, Laura Davis helps you to know that you are not wrong for feeling that so much is often about the survivor and their abuse. Sometimes, you feel overwhelmed by it. Laura helps you to learn a little about how to help you and your partner so that you are not overwhelmed.You learn how to take care of your desires, needs and more while helping your partner.I recommend reading this book if you are trying to help someone who is a survivorDisclosure: I used to post reviews under the name of ""Michaela Klein""- ""EarthAngel"""
2,"No ""Support"" for the Partner","This book was recommended by our marriage counselor, along with Courage to Heal. While it contains lots of useful information, it is basically a rehash of Courage, and there's little point in a partner reading both books. The author is a survivor, and the tone of this book reflects it. For example, in writing of her partner's departure, she alludes to her growth, sense of loss, etc. following the separation, but says little of her partner's thinking, feelings or experience. She also fails to properly prepare partners for the misdirected anger and other hurtful behavior.A partner would be much better served by Ken Graber's Ghosts in the Bedroom, followed by a reading of Courage to Heal (if only to learn what the survivor is probably being told). Incidentally, Graber's book is listed in the back of Allies in Healing, but the description hardly does the book justice."
1,WARNING: NOT INDUSTRIAL !!,I was duped into thinking this was an Industrial compilation. Wrong ! It's just a mix of Kill Rock Stars bands and the music is just not very good. You've been warned !
2,My Dog Would Not Drink His Water With This In It,"Too bad, he is a 2 year old Italian Greyhound Miniature Pinscher mix with beautiful teeth that I would like to keep nice. This additive had no smell or taste that I could detect, but he would not drink the water with this added, even if I added the smallest amount. This was with the water filtered through a Pur water filter. Oh well, he still has his CET chews and toothpaste which he likes."
4,EASY,This product seems to work-but be sure to add enough to water. Our dog has a real problem with tartar--so we use another product in addition to this one. Bottom line is that dog's teeth look good and its MUCH easier than brushing!
5,Helped my greyhound!!!,I use this in combination with the peppermint spray. The combination works extremely well. My greyhound's teeth are definitely better (no longer yellow) and her breath is no longer stinking up the house! Her teeth were bad when I rescued her 6 months ago.
5,Entertaining and Informative,"A number of wonderful Broadway performers giving their own vision and understanding of some of Bernstein's great works. My own favorites are Mandy Patinkin and Audra McDonald singing ""Tonight"", and Judy Blazer singing ""The Story of My Life"". They both bring me to tears every time. There is not a loser in the entire show."
2,Bernstein DVD,"Very disappointing and curious selection of Bernstein curios -- not enough of his best and best-known songs. But good singing, especially by Judy Blazer."
5,The best undiscovered musician in America.,"I've been listening to Michael Fracasso for almost ten years, because I love his raw tenor voice. This is far and away the best album that he has ever made. I am listening to it over and over again and it only gets better. It's so good that it defies genre; it's folk but it's better than folk, and it's roots but better than roots. The only thing that I can compare this to is Lucinda Williams' Car Wheels on A Gravel Road. It's on that level."
4,Item is not 1720 RPM as described,Amazon's description describes this as running at 1720 RPM which is equal to Makita's MAC2400 product which runs at half this one's speed (and is quieter as a result).NOTE THIS ITEM RUNS AT 3420 RPM AND HAS A SLIGHTLY LARGER BORE THAN THE MAC2400 - SO EXPECT IT TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY LOUDER.
5,I like it a lot.,"Awesome compressor. Shipping box a little flimsy, but unit was sent without a scratch. Wheels are a little clunky, so going up and down stairs with it is a little challenging still."
3,Not good for video use,"Unfortunately, these bulbs buzz a little. Not a lot, but enough that a good mic would hear them. You could probably filter it out in post, but I'd rather not have to deal with a buzz, so I'll have to return them.For any use other than video, they probably be great. They seem bright, and they are daylight balanced. As others have said, they are huge - about 11 inches long, and 3 inches diameter."
2,Probably Interesting but became repetitive,"I really wanted to like this book, and had no doubt that I would. So, I was disappointed when every chapter became a re-wording of the one before. Different places and times...but same story.I was very surprised the author did not seem to use his skills to make the reader want to keep reading the book. He seemed to literally have written exactly what Diana said.This could be seen an honest journalism, but for a book for major public consumption....it was too dull to finish."
4,Intriging,"Since the death of this incredible princess and mother, people have been either harping on her memory or exalting her to the pedistal of a goddess. I think that she would have been happiest knowing that others remembered her by continuing her work. Not by giving money to charity, although that is kind, but by loving others in need of love and helping those who are lonely. Diana cannot write her own biography now, but this book is, as it says, the closest thing we will get to her own autobiography. In the book it tells the story of how Diana grew up, became a troubled princess, and a happy mother. It speaks of her eating dissorder and how she over came it and changed her life by finding meaning in service. It also has been added onto in the end to tell about the last years of her life, her divorce, her death. It contains a special section that show Diana's words for the original story and contains pictures. Altogether it is and amazing book and most likely all true."
2,"This is the most depressing, biased book I have ever read.","How depressing to hear a grown woman whining and blaming absolutely everything on her husband. Here she was on their honeymoon, bulimic, slashing herself with knives, throwing herself down stairs, and then she wonders why he begins to distance himself? Diana comes across as truly disturbed and bitter, yet wanting all the perks that go along with marriage to a Royal. Her own long list of affairs rates one or two sentences in this book, but there is chapter after chapter about Camilla. I was glad to finish the book and put it away--it rather depressed me."
2,Didn't Hold Up. . . Good Value?,"When I wanted an NIV companion for my NASB NT I purchased this volume at my local Christian bookstore.I carry my little NT in either a suit coat or my pants pocket daily as I've done for decades. This version won't hold up to that type of use. In Texas where I live this NT is subject to both heat and humidity if carried in a suit pocket, and the cover started separating from the spine very soon. Now, I don't perspire any more than the average person, and I've never had a problem with my Cambridge leather NT, but this one simply didn't hold up.I'm not destitute, but I see no reason for purchasing this NT either for one's own use or for others. For an additional $2.00 one can purchase the Zondervan NIV NT with a very attractive and durable leather-look cover, and I don't know many people who literally couldn't afford $6.95 instead. It's a terrific value at that price."
4,You get what you pay for,"OK product for occaisional use but if you want one to use everyday get a more professional version. Grips are a bit thin, but it does the job."
3,Love the music but not exactly the one I was looking for,"the description on Amazon about the c.d. was vague so I didnt exactly know if it had all the song I loved from RSA. Only after I received this c.d. and played it, I found out it wasn't exactly the one I wanted but it still has the old skool RSA songs that you'd enjoy anyways."
5,"My, Oh My, Ohio!",Top performers well conducted all having lots of fun. One can not ask for any better than this. Simon Rattle is very good with L. Bernstein!
5,The best corn holders ever!,You will never buy anything better for corn on the cob holders. These are awesome. Storing them is much better than the old ones thrown in the drawer too. You will pleased with these and well worth the money.
1,Horrible!,"First, I bought this book 'cause I wanted to know how to grow food producing plants in the woodland. This book tells nothing about it! But it isn't the reason why I discredit this book.It's because ""all the dead branches should taken away from the woodland"" and ""almost all small trees should be removed""...This book tells you how to transform woodland to park (""woodland garden""). It's not good if you take branches away because it's away from fungi to decay them. And branches are beautiful, especially the big ones when there comes moss on them! And at autumn it's like huge snakes in the sea of fallen leaves!Awful book! The better is The American Woodland Garden: Capturing the Spirit of the Deciduous Forest, and for food producing Edible Forest Gardens I & II!"
3,Decent mask,Works ok but the material bends in easily. gotta store it stuffed or something. otherwise it won't look good when you put it on.
4,Darc Side: Disc Two - better than Disc One,"This 2 disc music set really gets me energized! I love it. I must admit, the second disc is much, much better than the first. And, I must admit, that I agree with one other individual who rated this CD that there is a really weird ""hissing"" noise behind all of the music. I thought it was just my system, but I guess I was wrong. The mixes are amazing and worth it even with the noise in the background. I usually only listen to CD 2, so having a the first is a little bit of a waste to me."
2,Average album from an average DJ,"Firstly, George Acosta is not the king of the US trance scene. I've seen him live. He's average. His transitions are not perfect adn his music choice is cliche and doesn't flow well together in his sets. This CD is more of the same. There are good tracks on the CD, but this is basically an average mix cd from an average DJ. If you want a good trance dj, try John '00 Flemming. He's far better."
2,installing,installing the software is complicated and the instruction mannuel is not helpful. i still havent found a way to intall it and im just thinking about returning it
1,This book stank so much that I threw it away while reading,First of all this book was boring. Secondly it was too long. Worst book I have ever read.
5,A detailed and comprehensive account of Croatia's history.,"Anyone interested in going beyond the standard media sound byte to understand the history of Croatia, will find Tanner's book an invaluable resource. Tanner chronicles in detail the long history of the Croatian people and emergence of the Croatian state, including the birth and shaping of national identity, personalities, myths and changing political panorama. While most works on the subject deal with specific, disjointed time periods of Croatian history, Tanner provides an insightful and comprehensive account - complete with references and facts rarely found in other sources. An enlightening read about a surprisingly complex nation and its turbulent path through the historical landscape."
1,A piece of croatian propaganda,The author has either neglected to research the history of the Serbs and Croats or has written this book with the goal of spreading croatian propaganda. The book is not worth the paper it's printed on and is very far away from from truth.
5,Excellent resource for students,"This is one java book that beginner to intermediate java programmers can look at. Easy to read, with loads of excellent examples. Also, very up to date, with great coverage of new features like Swing.Used by all staff and postgraduate students at the University of Natal (Durban, South Africa)"
5,A well written book and comprehensive introduction to Java.,Bruce Eckel obviously knows OOP well and presents his expertise in a thoughtful manner. The book is well organized with lots of examples highlighting various OOP concepts. I would recommend it to anyone interested in learning Java programming.
5,It's a bird! It's a plane! It's Superman: The Ultimate Guide,"If you want Superman, then you want ""Superman: The Ultimate Guide""! It takes you into the world of Kal-El and his adventures as Superman, The Last Son of Krypton! This book unveils the secrets of his birth, his home, his enemies, his powers, and much, much more.This book told me things I never knew about Superman. It can for you too. I give it a five star rating!"
1,REALLY BAD,REALLY BAD. I ALWAYS THOUGHT I LIKED FRANKIE LAINE BUT NO MORE. I SHOULD NOT HAVE BOUGHT TWO ALBUMS ON ONE CD.
4,works well,"easy install. sturdy enough. put together well, but not air tight - would be good for garage or non-heated area."
1,Manufacturer lied!,The manufacturer's website says it will work fine with my Dodge Stratus. Not even close. Totally different adapter needed...a 2 piece. This is a 1 piece.Sent back for a full refund.Nuff said.
4,works with vista,"This is the only flash drive I found on this site at this price point that was compatible with windows vista. However, a patch is required to allow the flash drive to work with vista. Also it needed a patch to work with both vista and xp. (I have one PC with xp and one with vista). Otherwise it seems to work great, it is fast, and the colored skins would be helpful to keep track of whose flash drive is whose."
4,Portable Storage,Product performed as advertised but had less usable space than anticipated with some of the junk programs on the media already.
4,Very good product!!!,"Just a regular 1GB USB jump drive. Pretty simple. Works fine, the only reason I gave it a 4 was that it came with a bunch of junk already on it from SanDisk that I had to delete. I guess some people use the applications on there. I would prefer that it wasn't on there in the first place, but I'm picky.... Overall, I'm 95% satisfied with my purchase! Haven't heard anything on the rebate though... hmmmm...."
4,Works fine now but....,"The only complaint I have is that if I plug it into a usb hub and not a usb in the computer, it never shuts off. The light never turns off, and when I select remove hardware, I always get a no can do message because it's still in use. No dat loss or corruption becasue of this as yet, but who knows."
4,Great cover up for nursing moms,"I really like how this cover up fits over me. It has plenty of fabric so that I can make sure I'm properly covered. The best feature is that it has a wire inside it that allows a window down to baby, so there is always direct eye contact. The fabric is light weight and the pattern is beautiful. I've gotten many compliments on it when I wear it out. One word of caution, always fold it back up the way you receive it and put it in your diaper bag. Some other mommies just roll it up without much care of the wire at the top and they end up bending it out of shape and that really defeats the point of buying this one."
5,Life Saver,"This has been such a huge help. Not only is it great when I need to nurse in public, but it has come in handy for times I'm home and people are visiting. I don't have to excuse myself to the other room when feeding my daughter, I can still be out and visiting with people. The fabric is nice and heavy but the window works great so I can make sure my baby has a good latch. There are even pockets in the corners which are useful for putting a pacifer or breast pad into. They are made of terry cloth too which is good for cleaning up spit ups. A fantastic product that any nursing mother should get to feel mobile once more."
3,Not for warmer climates,"This nursing cover works great and it's nice looking. I would love it if it weren't for the fact that the material doesn't breathe. I live in Hawaii, it's warm, so when I feed my baby I feel like I'm in an oven. It gets uncomfortably hot and by the time my baby finishes eating he's all hot and sweaty. This cover is good for cooler environments."
4,Great nursing cover up!,"I really like this nursing cover, it is large enough to cover everything and yet not too big. There is a little pocket in the lower left side that is perfect for a nursing pad, plus it's made of terrycloth which is handy if you need to wipe up any milk. The it's well made and the material is great. I gave it 4 out of 5 stars beause I found it to be a little bit warmer than I was hoping for. It is summer and I've been running warm since I had the baby, so that could just be me. All in all, I highly reccomend this cover."
5,great nursing cover,I love this wrap...easy to see baby with the sewn in ribbing and long enough to be discreet...use it all the time!
5,Great nursing cover and baby likes it too!,I owned this nursing cover for both of my kids and purchased this one as a gift after passing mine on to another friend. Both of my sons nursed for over 10 months and this nursing cover was a lifesaver! I love that you can still see your baby but that you are fully covered while nursing!
5,Very handy,"A bunch of family came to visit right after our daughter was born so we took them around town to see the sites. Between a bunch of visitors in our house and my wife learning how to nurse out in public, she was very appreciative of the Hooter Hider she received as a shower gift."
5,Love this nursing shield,This is a perfect nursing cover! It is large enough to keep mom covered. The neck opening is stiff so you can look at your baby while they nurse. And the neck strap keeps baby from exposing mom and is adjustable so you can have just a small peek at the baby or a really good look at the baby. The pattern is also very cute and the colors are like mint chocolate chip ice cream. I'm thinking about ordering a second one.
3,Light Fabric,"I love the Bebe Au Lait Nursing Covers as they do their job with some nice features like the rigid band at the top so that you are able to see and towel material at the corners. However, the Yoko fabric is light and airy which doesn't cover as well as the black one that I have. I only use this one as a back up simply because of the fabric."
5,Great Cover,"I purchased this when I was nursing my second child. I wish I had it for my first! It's large and covers not only little babies, but bigger ones. It is a quality made cover, not that thin material that flies away with a slight breeze, but it is breathable for the little one. The shaped neck at the top make it easy to peek in, the neck stap adjusts easily,and the cover keeps you had modesty in mind. My sister barrowed it when nursing her third child and said the same thing, she wishes she had it for child 1 & 2."
2,Didn't find it useful..here is why...,"I tried using it at home and didn't at all find it to be covering me appropriately...It doesn't give u any coverage in the back. If u r wearing a shirt, ur back is completely visible and also it gives u coverage only to one side. The worst part is, it doesn't give good visibility to ur child b/c it bends at a wierd angle and blocks visibility to ur child...somehow it was very annoying to use it. I returned the item after trying to use it twice at home."
5,Works great,Bought this for my Intel-powered iMac. Installed quickly and easily and is working fine.
1,got ripped off,"I purchased this 2 gigs of memory and when i received it, the plastic cover was cut and was switched with 512 mb. what a dishonest way to do business. shame on you greatbuy. don't deserve my business anymore. jp"
4,Very satisfied,I recieved the product promptly and had no problem with the install. Works great and I have had no problems.
1,Not so good. Just a sad attempt at a thriller.,"I was let down. The characters were not that hot, and the story was cleche. Sorry, just my opinion."
3,Ho Hum story of a true life thief,"The very mention of a jewell thief conjures up images of a tuxedo clad man ddangling from an apartment building pulling off daring heist after daring society based heist while the community at large was lyrical with ridiculous theory after ridiculous theory. Mason's story, while eminently readable does border on the repetitive and definitely self-congratulatory.Told in the lingo and straight ahead style of a true everyman the pathos surrounding his guilty conscience and attitudes to his wife doesn't quite ring true and we get the feeling that despite his addiction, he was immensely proud of what he had done despite his continuous statements to the contrary.All in all an entertaining enough read."
3,Unforgettable Musical Memories,"This book apparently was on a shelf for years and never been used. When I opened it, although it had no apparent damage to it from outside appearance, the pages starting coming loose at the spine. I do not blame the seller for this, I think it is simply due to age. I have been able to salvage some of the pages and tape them in folders to be used as individual pieces of music, so all is not lost. I reordered the book and have rec'd another copy of it which is in good condition, as promised. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the seller of this book since it was as described and arrived in a timely manner. By appearance it was in excellent condition. It was simply old. I wanted the book because of its age and the era of music contained therein, so I'm not all that disappointed. I can still use it as I described."
2,A significant omission,I was disappointed that only 'rock' albums were discussed. I was hoping to see someone tear George Winston to shreds.Sigh.....
1,Irresponsible title?,"Isn't it irresponsible to title this book ""Kill Your Idols""? We live in a sick world, where stalkers and other delusional people DO kill their idols. The last thing we need is another impetus for them to do so. Tongue in cheek title? Maybe so, but that's vastly outweighed by the potential harm. Remember John Lennon! Derogatis and Barricade Books ought to be ashamed of themselves."
1,Hooey,"Older rock critics NEVER liked The Best of the Doors, Dark Side of the Moon, Ram, and Sgt. Pepper's (or for that matter, most of 'em, Kick Out the Jams, which DeRogatis's hero Lester Bangs tried to kill on contact), so what's the point here? A slim pretense on which to hang a payday, but then, that's authorial style for ya. And by the way, if somebody can't hear what's great about Exile on Main Street and the Sex Pistols, they're the dope.--Dave Marsh"
5,Solsbury Hill Remix CD,I recieved this cd as soon as they said I would. I'm very happy with the condition it is in. I would definately by from this seller again.
2,"Worst Season ever, the FAT FIVE + TWILA & SCOUT = TERRIBLE SURVIVOR SEASON","Ok I love Survivor but this was one of the worst seasons ever.I'll start off with the few highlights : John K, Brady and the young guys were some of the most likebale people ever on survivor. Amy was enjoyable and well, that;s about it.The best castaways (as well as athletic) got voted out by the ""FAT FIVE"" the annoying and scary Chris (won won, YUCK!) Sarge (blah), Rory (CREEPY) Buba (Do I even have to say antyhing about him?) and some other non athletic 40+ flabby player.Twila was interesting but also a potty mouth, Scout and Aliza became annoying and by mid season I just tuned right out.It was ""the season of the worst"" for sure."
4,I love Survivor!,"I loved this Survivor season! It's one of my favorites. The island seasons are best because the tropical weather complicates things so much. You really get to see how things can get miserable really fast. Imagine what it would be like if you were really stranded on an island like this! No one to give you flint, rice, and food rewards.I also like the shelters the ""survivors"" build in the tropical locations. A lot of times they get bamboo and make some pretty solid shelters with woven palm leaves for a roof."
1,not made well at all,"sort of cheap feeling controller. it broke after 2 days of playing, the x button stopped working!!!it was a waste of money."
1,Do not buy this drive,"Titanium 1.0g worked for a few months. Died never to work again. Fortunately, I had backed up all my data on another drive. Woun't ever buy from this company again. Expensive product... crappy piece of equipment."
2,Awkward to plug in,"Although my Cruzer works fine, the slide out configuration can make it very hard to use. In a crowded environment like the back of a Dell or in front of a Dell where it goes in at an angle, you must hold on to the slider as you plug it in. This is almost impossible on my Dell. The Imation where you rotate the head to protect it is much more practical."
2,Unstable at any speed,"A good looking device. I wanted it to work. However, it is hard to get the usb connector to stick out of its titanium shell. It is a wobbly connection when plugged into a usb port, frequently losing connection. Now, my computer is not recognizing the device and I am afraid that I lost 6 hours of work yesterday. My advice: back up very frequently. I use WinZip to back up to an archive file on my hard drive."
1,Unfriendly to me,My current flash drive is only 256 Mb and I decided to get one with more capacity so I bought the SanDisk SDCZ3 1GB. With my current flash drive I simply plug it into the the USB port and drag and drop files. It acts like another drive. I thought this new one would be the same. It isn't. After fooling around with the new Sandisk 1GB drive for about 15 minutes I could not transfer a single file. I even spent time on their user guide which was no help. That was enough for me. I returned it.
1,Wow! Fried in one day! Flash-in-Pan Drive!,"I bought this yesterday, without doing any research, at a retail store. I was convinced, I guess, by the hype of ""rugged"". I had trouble getting the software to work from the start. Some of the recommended software from the website simply would not install. I tried re-formatting the drive, & when I tried to re-enter the basic Launch software, I got the message that my Titanium was no longer usable. Many retries at reformatting have failed. I've scanned the reviews here, and I think I hold the record, 20 hours. ""Flash"" drive. Whoosh! I had idea it would be like buying a $70 sparkler. I'll update you on my struggle to get this taken care of."
1,Terrible product and company,The product didn't last even four months before it failed. I had an authorization to return to Sandisk for replacement. Their return center lost the defective unit and would not replace the unit. They don't honor their warranties. They are a terrible company and make a low quality product.
1,My Cruzer has Failed Too !,"Like others... my ScanDisk Cruzer Titanium flash drive failed. ScanDisk, too, will not respond to my inquiries. Apparently the warranty I purchased along with the product isn't good either. Do not buy this or any other product from ScanDisk."
2,Bought 3 of them and they ALL Stopped Working,"We bought 3 of these 1G Titanium Cruzers. They looked rugged and had fast transfer, but by the end of the 4th week of using them, all three were either not functioning at all or working itermitently (USB device not working properly errors). Perhaps this was a bad batch, but beware. Also the shell was supposedly rugged, but one got bumped when it was in the computer and after that when the USB connecter slid fully into the main casing it would jam and not slide out of the casing again unless you got something to wiggle the USB connector."
3,only for the hardcore fan,a very thin graphic novel that will appeal only to the hard core goddess fan. the humour is pretty weird at times and the stories are of the short 3 panel variety. skip this book and focus on the manga series (unless of course you already have those and have spare cash laying around)
3,simple and nice.,"I ordered these for my girlfriend, and she seemed to love them. Only problem is that the box it came it looks very very cheap."
3,not bad,"It is tricky to close it correctly and even after a lot of practice the shaker isn't closed tight enough and leaks, but its fine as a shaker.I didn't think of the remaining few drops of liquid leaking from under the lid as a big deal when I read reviews before buying the shaker, but it is a little annoying. The chocolate protein shake I use it for almost always drips on my shirt or face from the lid and its a small hole in the lid and it is hard to wipe it off with your finger or lick it after shaking your drink and opening the lid to drink it."
3,Purchased after reading The Log from the Sea of Cortez,"Product was delivered on time and as expected. The production quality was just so-so. That being said, if you have an interest in Steinbeck, you may be interested in the film. To my knowledge it's the only film he made."
3,Clarification,"This is an album of Andrei Danilko's instrumental music, not related to his ""Verka Serduchka"" character. On the album, he plays synthesizer and piano in a set of ambient-new age pieces."
5,Vegan Cooking For One,"This book was purchased after I had borrowed it from the Library and tried some of the recipes.I find the recipes easy to follow, and very simple and straight forward. I have enjoyed all the ones I tried and found them delicious. One of the best part about the recipes are the measurements. They are for One. Therefore, no left overs, which means not having to eat the same dish for three or four nights in a row. I really enjoy this book and if you are a Vegan cooking for one, I think you will enjoy it as well."
4,From the Majestic to the Ethereal,"Yanni has been the unfair target of a lot of jokes when it comes to new age music in general (one of many reasons why I don't like that label), but once you give his music a serious listen you will be hooked. The two dozen tracks are drawn from ten different albums from 1986's KEYS TO IMAGINATION to 1993's IN MY TIME. His music runs the range of majestic to ethereal--the perfect remedy to relieve the stress of a hectic day. There are other single-disc compilations available, but for the casual fan, this is an excellent place to start. [Running Time: 127:04] RECOMMENDED"
1,Save your time and money,Sam Girgus sounds like a college professor trying to impress some freshmen students. He has no idea how to make a interesting subject interesting to read about. Don't waste your money on this garbage.
1,What's up with the Restrictive Software License?,"This looks like a good object-oriented framework for building PHP apps, but what is up with the restrictive license that accompanies the programming examples in the book? (see the back page of the book, and the license.txt file on the disk)""You may not (i) rent or lease the Software, (ii) copy or reproduce the software through a LAN or other network system or through any computer subscriber system or bulletin- board system, or (iii) modify, adapt, or create derivative works based on the Software.""I've never seen a book try to restrice the programming examples in this way.Stay away if you intend to build professional products. There are many other frameworks available for PHP OOP."
